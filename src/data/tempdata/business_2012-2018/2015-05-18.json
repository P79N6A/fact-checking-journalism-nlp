      "bodyText": "A global shift to more insecure jobs since the financial crisis is fuelling growing inequality and higher rates of poverty, according to a new report that estimates only a quarter of the world\u2019s workers are on permanent contracts. The International Labour Organization (ILO) said the remaining three quarters are employed on temporary or short-term contracts, working informally often without any contract, are self-employed or are in unpaid family jobs. A worldwide trend away from secure jobs risked \u201cperpetuating a vicious circle of weak global demand and slow job creation\u201d that has dogged many countries since the crisis, the UN agency said. In its World Employment and Social Outlook 2015 (WESO), the agency highlighted a rise in part-time employment, especially among young women. Though some workers welcome the flexibility of part-time jobs and self-employment, often such roles are down to lack of choice, it said. Only one in four in secure work \u201cIn some cases, non-standard forms of work can help people get a foothold into the job market. But these emerging trends are also a reflection of the widespread insecurity that\u2019s affecting many workers worldwide today,\u201d said ILO director-general Guy Ryder. \u201cThe shift we\u2019re seeing from the traditional employment relationship to more non-standard forms of employment is in many cases associated with the rise in inequality and poverty rates in many countries,\u201d added Ryder. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, these trends risk perpetuating the vicious circle of weak global demand and slow job creation that has characterised the global economy and many labour markets throughout the post-crisis period.\u201d The report found that the number of people on wage and salaried work \u2013 as opposed to forms of work such as self-employment or without contracts \u2013 was growing worldwide but less than half, or 42%, of those were on a permanent contract. Workers on wages or salaries still accounted for only half of global employment, with wide variations across regions. The report\u2019s main author, Raymond Torres, noted that in developing countries wage and salaried work was growing at a slower pace than before the crisis, while in advanced economies such jobs were not growing and weredeclining in some cases \u2013 such as in the UK. Secure jobs decline in rich countries There were signs of declining employment security in high-income countries since the financial crisis, Torres said, flagging up the rise of self-employment, of workers without contracts and those who were involuntarily working part-time. \u201cThe remuneration of people on these types of contract tends to be less,\u201d added Torres, director of the ILO research department. The report drew a link between widespread insecurity at work and rising income inequality in many countries. \u201cThe income gap between permanent and non-permanent workers has increased over the past decade,\u201d it said. The ILO is urging policymakers to consider extending social protection such as pensions and unemployment benefit to workers in less secure forms of employment. It said that globally only 16% of the self-employed were part of a pension scheme, compared with 52% of employees. Torres cited Chile, China and Brazil as examples of countries that were moving towards great social protection for the self-employed and said the evidence suggested such policies did not harm employment rates. \u201cSome people have said by moving in this direction to social protection or more regulations you have fewer jobs but that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said. Women doing worse since crisis The ILO also highlighted a comparatively slower recovery in female unemployment rates since 2009 in many regions, including the European Union. The report found that the rise in the number of part-time jobs outpaced gains in full-time jobs between 2009 and 2013 in the vast majority of countries with available information. \u201cIn France, Italy, Japan, Spain and the European Union more broadly, increases in part-time employment occurred alongside losses in full-time jobs \u2013 leading in some instances to overall job losses during this period ... Much of the increase in part-time employment has been involuntary,\u201d the report said.",

Making his first speech since replacing Vince Cable, Javid will say that the government\u2019s plan to preside over the creation of 2m jobs in the next five years will involve making Britain the best place in Europe to start a new business. However, alongside the proposed assault on bureaucracy, the business secretary announced plans for a new government-funded body to help small businesses recoup the more than \u00a330bn owed to them in late payments of bills. The creation of a small business conciliation service was part of the Conservative manifesto and Javid said the proposal would help to settle disputes. \u201cSmall businesses are Britain\u2019s engine room and the success of our whole economy is built on the hard work and determination of the people who run and work for them,\u201d Javid will say in a speech in Bristol, where he grew up in a flat above his parents\u2019 shop. \u201cAs business secretary, I will always back them and, in my determination to get the job done, one of my first steps will be to bring forward an enterprise bill that helps them to succeed and create jobs. \u201cAs part of our long-term economic plan, we will sweep away burdensome red tape, get heavy handed regulators off firms\u2019 backs and create a small business conciliation service to help resolve disputes.\u201d It is estimated that small businesses are owed \u00a332bn in late payments but are often unaware of their rights or are reluctant to take legal action, fearing they will lose future business. The enterprise bill will extend the fight against red tape beyond Whitehall and for the first time include independent regulators. Javid\u2019s plans were welcomed by John Allan, chairman of the National Federation of Small Businesses. He said: \u201cOur members have been clear on the need to make progress on cutting burdensome red tape and on addressing issues like the billions owed to small businesses in overdue payments. \u201cThese are not easy issues to tackle and we will need the minister to work closely with our members and the wider business community to find solutions.

      "bodyText": "Wonga is bringing in a \u201cmoney-back guarantee\u201d and has unveiled new TV adverts aimed at a more middle class audience as the payday loans firm attempts to restore its reputation and move upmarket. Following a year in which it was embroiled in scandal for sending out fake legal letters to struggling borrowers and cleared the overdue debts or charges for 375,000 people at a cost of \u00a3220m, Britain\u2019s biggest payday loans firm has attempted to relaunch itself with its sights on the 13 million people in the UK that it describes as \u201ccash and credit constrained\u201d. Wonga said it was trying to \u201cmove away from\u201d people with more serious black marks on their credit files \u2013 but the changes do not include a fresh reduction in the company\u2019s huge annualised interest rate, or APR, which currently stands at 1,509%. As part of the clean-up operation instituted by chairman Andy Haste, the company revealed it carried out consumer research into whether it should abandon the Wonga brand, but concluded that despite all the problems, it still had very high \u201cprompted awareness\u201d that was \u201cright up there with the banks,\u201d adding: \u201cWe are still seen as a trusted brand by our core audience.\u201d As part of the relaunch, Wonga announced several new product features that are either available now or will be introduced over the next few months, including a \u201c24-hour money-back guarantee\u201d allowing customers who change their mind to cancel their loan and pay no interest or fees, with no impact on their credit file; a three-day grace period, where customers who are one or two days late with their repayment will escape the \u00a315 default fee; and freezing all balances in arrears to stop them racking up interest for longer than seven days \u2013 under the current policy interest can accumulate for 30 days. Wonga has also \u201crefreshed\u201d its branding and website, and is launching a marketing campaign from Tuesday that includes TV, radio, press and online advertising. One of Haste\u2019s first announcements on taking up the reins in July 2014 was that the controversial grandparent puppets used in the company\u2019s TV adverts would be dropped. The new TV advert features \u201creal-world hard-working people\u201d, including a dental nurse, art gallery attendant and what appears to be a middle-class mother of young children, plus a school dinner lady, farmer and tipper truck driver. A combination of the bad publicity and a lower profile over the past year means Wonga now has fewer than 600,000 customers, compared to around one million in its heyday. In response Wonga has widened its sights, and said that while the payday loans market was traditionally viewed as being made up of about two-to-three million people, it was targeting a potential market of 13 million people who were, it said, \u201cbeing under-served by traditional lenders\u201d. This includes people with more minor marks on their credit files or who are new to borrowing. \u201cSome could have reasonable degrees of affluence and earning,\u201d said Chris Bibby, the firm\u2019s marketing and brand director. The company said it was attempting to reduce the risk of its adverts \u201cinadvertently attracting the young or vulnerable\u201d by working with media outlets to \u201cself-impose\u201d a set of restrictions. This will see the firm excluding its ads from TV programmes and channels that are not specifically aimed at children but which are often popular with young people, such as Channel 4 show The Big Bang Theory, Futurama on Sky, and the MTV and Animal Planet channels. Founded in 2006, Wonga has long come under fire for its sky-high rates. The Church of England condemned the company as \u201cmorally wrong\u201d and pledged to \u201ccompete it out of existence\u201d by boosting credit unions, while politicians such as Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy have labelled its activities \u201clegal loan sharking\u201d. But the company suffered its biggest blow in June 2014 when the Financial Conduct Authority found it guilty of unfair and misleading debt-collection practices, including sending letters to struggling borrowers in the names of made-up law firms \u201cBarker &amp; Lowe\u201d and \u201cChainey, D\u2019Amato &amp; Shannon\u201d. Wonga was ordered to pay compensation of more than \u00a32.6m to about 45,000 customers. Tara Kneafsey, the UK chief executive of Wonga, said other products would be launched later in the year, but that a payday loan would remain a key part of the business. \u201cOur new product features and today\u2019s marketing re-launch are further proof of the action we\u2019ve taken, and continue to take, to ensure Wonga is lending responsibly and putting customer outcomes first,\u201d she said. \u201cOur focus is on serving hard-working people throughout the UK who need access to transparent, flexible and short-term credit products.\u201d",

This includes people with more minor marks on their credit files or who are new to borrowing. \u201cSome could have reasonable degrees of affluence and earning,\u201d said Chris Bibby, the firm\u2019s marketing and brand director. <br></p> <p>The company said it was attempting to reduce the risk of its adverts \u201cinadvertently attracting the young or vulnerable\u201d by working with media outlets to \u201cself-impose\u201d a set of restrictions. This will see the firm excluding its ads from TV programmes and channels that are not specifically aimed at children but which are often popular with young people, such as Channel 4 show The Big Bang Theory, Futurama on Sky, and the MTV and Animal Planet channels.<br></p> <p>Founded in 2006, Wonga has long come under fire for its sky-high rates. The Church of England <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/15/fca-imposes-cap-on-payday-loans\">condemned the company as \u201cmorally wrong\u201d</a> and pledged to \u201ccompete it out of existence\u201d by boosting credit unions, while politicians such as Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy have labelled its activities \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/03/legal-loan-sharks-regulating\">legal loan sharking</a>\u201d.<br></p> <p>But the company suffered its biggest blow in June 2014 when the Financial Conduct Authority found it <a href=\"http://www.fca.org.uk/news/wonga-redress-unfair-debt-collection-practices\">guilty of unfair and misleading debt-collection practices</a>, including sending letters to struggling borrowers in the names of made-up law firms \u201cBarker &amp; Lowe\u201d and \u201cChainey, D\u2019Amato &amp; Shannon\u201d. Wonga was ordered to pay compensation of more than \u00a32.6m to about 45,000 customers.<br></p> <p>Tara Kneafsey, the UK chief executive of Wonga, said other products would be launched later in the year, but that a payday loan would remain a key part of the business. \u201cOur new product features and today\u2019s marketing re-launch are further proof of the action we\u2019ve taken, and continue to take, to ensure Wonga is lending responsibly and putting customer outcomes first,\u201d she said. <br></p> <p>\u201cOur focus is on serving hard-working people throughout the UK who need access to transparent, flexible and short-term credit products.\u201d</p>",

If the deal is approved, it will maintain business as usual at many RadioShack stores and keep the data with them. If not, RadioShack will have a much harder time selling the data should it need to liquidate its assets. </p> <p>\u201cThe firm has been working with the state attorneys general to ensure that the customer data is protected, and has committed to maintain RadioShack\u2019s strict privacy policies,\u201d said a spokesman for Standard General.<br></p> <p>Jessica L Rich, FTC bureau of consumer protection director, said if the company wants to do that, it has to notify everyone involved. \u201c[W]e believe it would be appropriate for RadioShack to obtain affirmative consent from its customers before it transfers the data. The consent process would allow customers to make their own determination as to whether a transfer of their information would be acceptable to them. For consumers who do not consent, their data would be purged.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe information you give us is treated with discretion and respect,\u201d reads the RadioShack privacy policy in place at the time of the company\u2019s bankruptcy. \u201cWe pride ourselves on not selling our private mailing list. From time to time, we may send you information from our company or from select, responsible companies that may join with RadioShack to bring you special offers.\u201d</p> <p>Soon, it will be the highest bidder looking to bring special offers to RadioShack\u2019s former customers, and Rich is firing off a warning shot. \u201cWe are concerned,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthat a sale or transfer of the personal information of RadioShack\u2019s customers would contravene RadioShack\u2019s express promise not to sell or rent such information and could constitute a deceptive or unfair practice under Section 5 of the FTC Act.\u201d</p> <p>RadioShack said in court filings that it collected more than 117m customer records, though many of the entries may be duplicates. Now that technology has made it possible for advertisers to look at data sets of that size at scale, that information is incredibly valuable to marketers who can design and target ad campaigns based on such massive amounts of personal information.</p> <p>Tough talk aside, when the FTC censured Toysmart, an online toy retailer seeking to sell similar information in bankruptcy, the regulator published a set of guidelines. In her brief, Frejka proposed a very similar set of guidelines for anybody who wanted to purchase the data in a response to Rich\u2019s letter.</p> <p> </p> <p>If a buyer wants to take over the company and run it as a going concern with its websites and stores intact, Frejka wrote, there should be no problem with its maintaining RadioShack\u2019s databases of personally identifiable information on its customers. Similarly, she contended that the courts should have no problem with the transaction if a high bidder agrees to abide by RadioShack\u2019s privacy policies and give data-mined customers a heads-up, no permission asked.</p> <p>The question of whether the consumer gets a say will probably be the sticking point between the company and the FTC.</p>",

If the deal is approved, it will maintain business as usual at many RadioShack stores and keep the data with them. If not, RadioShack will have a much harder time selling the data should it need to liquidate its assets. \u201cThe firm has been working with the state attorneys general to ensure that the customer data is protected, and has committed to maintain RadioShack\u2019s strict privacy policies,\u201d said a spokesman for Standard General. Jessica L Rich, FTC bureau of consumer protection director, said if the company wants to do that, it has to notify everyone involved. \u201c[W]e believe it would be appropriate for RadioShack to obtain affirmative consent from its customers before it transfers the data. The consent process would allow customers to make their own determination as to whether a transfer of their information would be acceptable to them. For consumers who do not consent, their data would be purged.\u201d \u201cThe information you give us is treated with discretion and respect,\u201d reads the RadioShack privacy policy in place at the time of the company\u2019s bankruptcy. \u201cWe pride ourselves on not selling our private mailing list. From time to time, we may send you information from our company or from select, responsible companies that may join with RadioShack to bring you special offers.\u201d Soon, it will be the highest bidder looking to bring special offers to RadioShack\u2019s former customers, and Rich is firing off a warning shot. \u201cWe are concerned,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthat a sale or transfer of the personal information of RadioShack\u2019s customers would contravene RadioShack\u2019s express promise not to sell or rent such information and could constitute a deceptive or unfair practice under Section 5 of the FTC Act.\u201d RadioShack said in court filings that it collected more than 117m customer records, though many of the entries may be duplicates. Now that technology has made it possible for advertisers to look at data sets of that size at scale, that information is incredibly valuable to marketers who can design and target ad campaigns based on such massive amounts of personal information. Tough talk aside, when the FTC censured Toysmart, an online toy retailer seeking to sell similar information in bankruptcy, the regulator published a set of guidelines. In her brief, Frejka proposed a very similar set of guidelines for anybody who wanted to purchase the data in a response to Rich\u2019s letter. If a buyer wants to take over the company and run it as a going concern with its websites and stores intact, Frejka wrote, there should be no problem with its maintaining RadioShack\u2019s databases of personally identifiable information on its customers. Similarly, she contended that the courts should have no problem with the transaction if a high bidder agrees to abide by RadioShack\u2019s privacy policies and give data-mined customers a heads-up, no permission asked. The question of whether the consumer gets a say will probably be the sticking point between the company and the FTC.",

She told the Mail on Sunday: \u201cIt seems our children\u2019s lives are worth only a fraction of Thomas Cook\u2019s reputation.\u201d On Monday, Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said the company had received \u00a31.5m and had handed over the full amount to the UN children\u2019s organisation Unicef. \u201cThomas Cook has not in any way profited from our claim against the hotel owner,\u201d he said. \u201cIn late 2012 we brought a claim against the hotelier for breaching their contract to provide safe accommodation to our customers and to comply with all applicable laws, which was decided in our favour. \u201cToday I have made arrangements for the full amount \u2013 \u00a31.5m \u2013 to be donated in full to Unicef, the world\u2019s leading children\u2019s organisation. I believe this is the right thing to do and I apologise to the family for all they have gone through.\u201d Fankhauser confirmed that his firm received the \u00a31.5m, mainly in respect of legal fees, as part of a \u00a33m settlement with Louis Group, the hotel owners. The other \u00a31.5m went to Thomas Cook\u2019s insurers. Thomas Cook said in October 2012 it had filed a claim against the Louis Group, the South African family-owned multinational that controls the Louis Corcyra hotel, to claw back costs and legal fees. The high court had awarded Thomas Cook an initial \u00a31m in July 2013 and the rest of the money the following September. Last Wednesday, an inquest jury reached a verdict of unlawful killing and said Thomas Cook had breached its duty of care. The foreman read out a series of conclusions, including that the hotel misled Thomas Cook about its gas supply and that the holiday firm\u2019s health and safety audit of the complex was inadequate. Wood said after the inquest that she would always hold Thomas Cook responsible for the deaths, arguing that it \u201ccould and should have identified that lethal boiler\u201d. The children\u2019s father, Neil Shepherd, claimed the company had \u201chidden behind a wall of silence and they have refused to answer any questions for almost nine years\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The \u00a35m pay deal for the boss of the Co-operative Bank is under fire from campaigners who are urging the loss-making bank to take a stand against extravagant bonuses. Save Our Bank, which claims to have 10,000 members, has written an open to letter to the bank calling on Niall Booker, the chief executive, to acknowledge he is running a bank with its roots in the co-operative sector and give up his bonus. Booker, who joined in May 2013 when the bank on was the brink of collapse, could receive up to \u00a35m under a new pay deal announced in March. The deal, intended to keep him in place until 31 December 2016, could see Booker receive \u00a34.97m this year and \u00a34.5m in 2016. His basic salary is \u00a31.3m. Welcoming the bank\u2019s ethical policies, the Save Our Bank campaigners said the bank\u2019s customers \u201csimply expect you to take a stand against such extravagant pay packages\u201d. Booker was part of a team assembled by Euan Sutherland, who quit the Co-operative Group in March 2014 after details of his \u00a36.6m pay deal over two years was leaked to the Observer. The group, which owns supermarkets and funeral homes, relinquished its 100% ownership of the bank last year and now has just a 20% stake, following a \u00a32bn fundraising that was largely backed by hedge funds. Save Our Bank published comparative figures for other top bankers, including Ross McEwan at RBS \u2013 who is expected to be paid \u00a32.7m this year \u2013 and HSBC\u2019s Stuart Gulliver, who was paid \u00a37.6m in 2014. The Lloyds Banking Group boss Antonio Horta-Osorio was paid \u00a311.5m. McEwan also rejected \u00a31m of top-up payments he could have received under the bank\u2019s scheme to sidestep the EU cap on bonuses. In the letter, the Save Our Bank campaigners said: \u201cWe ask the bank to set out full details of the CEO\u2019s pay structure, and to explain how it considers this to be fair, responsible and ethical.\u201d \u201cWe also strongly urge Niall Booker to recognise that he is the CEO of a bank with its roots in the co-operative sector, and which is expected to meet higher standards on pay than the \u2018big four\u2019, and to hand back his bonus. This gesture would go a long way towards illustrating that the bank is dedicated to restoring trust and to presenting a genuine ethical alternative. If RBS can do it, so can you,\u201d the letter said. Booker has not received his bonus for 2015 but it could be worth up to \u00a31.25m. He also receives \u00a3400,000 in top-up payments to avoid the EU bonus cap. The bank refused to comment. In March, when the pay deal was announced, Dennis Holt, the bank\u2019s chairman, said Booker\u2019s pay last year was set \u201cagainst very stretching targets\u201d. Pay was a topic of controversy during the annual general meeting of the Co-op Group on Saturday when a third of members declined to back the remuneration report, which included payouts to departed directors such as Sutherland. The vote against was 22%, rising to 33% including abstentions.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "PS: Greece\u2019s government spokesman (a reader of this blog, it seems) has got in touch to repudiate any suggestion that Greek savers could face a levy, as part of a new aid deal for Greece. From Athens, Helena Smith reports I just took a call from Gavriel Sakellarides hotly denying any notion that a bail-in is being considered. \u201cWe exclude any such scenario,\u201d Sakellarides told me adding that he only mentioned the subject at today\u2019s daily briefing because a journalist brought it up. \u201cI was asked about it and wholeheartedly ruled it out. The stability of the financial sector and banking system is very important to us. Categorically there will be no bail in.\u201d Government sources are now saying that while they expect progress to be made by technical teams this week, a breakthrough is unlikely to happen by the time the EU summit begins on Thursday. One insider said: \u201cThe Riga summit will see progress on a technical level and perhaps meetings on the sidelines (between Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and his counterparts) but we don\u2019t expect a deal to be agreed there. That will likely require an emergency eurogroup meeting before the end of May.\u201d It was vital, the source acknowledged, that an agreement was reached by the end of May \u201cbut that is also up to the other side too. We have already made lots of concessions. Labour market reform and pensions are the two things we are not going to go back on.\u201d Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis will get the chance to comment on today\u2019s developments late night, when he\u2019s interviewed by Star TV. Enikos will be providing a live translation: As that\u2019s not until 11.30pm Greek time (9.30pm UK), I\u2019m going to nail the lid down for the day, unless there are major developments tonight...... Reports that Jean-Claude Juncker has been beavering away on a new Greek rescue plan has not amused the country\u2019s other creditors, reports Peter Spiegel, the FT\u2019s Brussels bureau chief. Peter reckons that the proposal is one in a series of ideas being bounced between the Commission and Athens, rather than as concrete plan. That explains why the plan offered various concessions to Greece (such as lower primary surpluses, and delayed tax rises) And that could further hurt relations between the EC and its fellow lenders, he says: It is now no secret that the Commission views the IMF and Berlin as being unreasonably hard-line in the Greek talks and Commission officials, including Juncker himself, have been trying to bridge differences between Athens and hard-line elements for weeks. It is also no secret that many others involved in the talks are none-too-pleased with the Commission\u2019s freelancing. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who leads the negotiations on the part of his fellow eurozone ministers, has been quite open about his unhappiness that the Commission tried to intervene without his knowledge back in February, when everyone was desperately trying to convince Athens to seek an extension of the current \u20ac172bn bailout before it expired. The new Juncker effort could touch off similar recriminations, because it appears that none of the other players knew what Juncker was up to. \u201cWe are thunderstruck,\u201d said one official involved in the talks, who said the ECB and the IMF \u2013 who are theoretically on a co-equal standing with the Commission when it comes to talks with Greek authorities \u2013 were unaware such a proposal was being mooted. Pierre Moscovici\u2019s spokesman, Olivier Bailly, has just declined to confirm those reports of a new proposal to resolve the Greek crisis. \u201cCan\u2019t confirm\u201d does leave some wriggle room, though... Amid the confusion over Greece, London\u2019s stock market has ended the day largely where it started. The FTSE 100 ended the day up just 8 points, or 0.1%. Silver producer Fresnillo jumped 5%, tracking a rally in the price of silver. Pharmaceuticals company Hikma led the fallers down 1.4% after announcing the death of its cofounder Samih Darwazah (his family own 29% of the firm). Most other European markets rose, although the Milan index fell over 1%, partly because several large Italian firm went ex-dividend (so new shareholders won\u2019t qualify for the next payout). EUROPE\u2019S FTSEUROFIRST 300 PROVISIONALLY CLOSES UP 0.4% AT 1,579.01 PTS FRENCH CAC 40 UP 0.3%, GERMAN DAX UP 1.3% SPAIN\u2019S IBEX UP 0.6% Breaking away from Greece..... activist investor Carl Icann has just declared that Apple shares should be worth almost double their current value. Icann has renewed his pressure on the company to boost its share buyback scheme, with a new letter to CEO Tim Cook. In it, he claims Apple is actually worth $240 per share, not the $128 it is currently trading at. Icann writes: Apple is poised to enter and in our view dominate two new categories (the television next year and the automobile by 2020) with a combined addressable market of $2.2 trillion, a view investors don\u2019t appear to factor into their valuation at all. He also cited Apple Watch, Apple Pay, Homekit, Healthkit, and Beats Music as further proof that Apple will only increase its domination, before riffing on the environmental factors that will drive demand for lithium-ion batteries. The bottom line remains the same -- Apple should spend even more of its massive cash pile repurchasing its shares. Now the intrigue starts...... The Greek stock market staged a little rally after To Vima reported that EC president Juncker had proposed a compromise: Unfortunately for Athens investors, the exchange closed for the day before the EC declined to confirm the story. Greek insiders are also downplaying the idea that Jean-Claude Juncker has cracked the crisis: The EC has left itself some wriggle room, points out Danny Kemp, AFP\u2019s deputy bureau chief in Brussels: Perhaps the proposal seen by To Vima is tied up with this week\u2019s EU leaders meeting in Riga? Perhaps it\u2019s a draft plan, or an old plan? Perhaps it\u2019s all a mistake. Perhaps we\u2019ll never know.... That semi-denial again: EU COMMISSION SAYS NOT AWARE OF ANY NEW JUNCKER PROPOSAL FOR GREECE WITH LOWER PRIMARY SURPLUS TARGETS European Commission spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt says she cannot confirm that Jean-Claude Juncker has made a new proposal to break the Greek deadlock. We\u2019re still working towards a comprehensive deal, she adds. Teneo Intelligence\u2019s Wolf Piccoli has his doubts too: At first glance, it\u2019s not clear that Juncker\u2019s new proposal contains enough reform measures to satisfy Greece\u2019s creditors. Delaying VAT rises, modifying labour reforms and lowering the primary surplus targets will all make a dent in Greece\u2019s budgets. There\u2019s no mention of new reforms to make up the gap. Effectively it would unlock some aid for Athens today, in return for fiscal consolidation tomorrow. Greek newspaper To Vima is reporting that EC president Jean-Claude Juncker has proposed a deal to break the deadlock between Greece and its lenders. This deal include smaller primary budget surplus targets (just 0.75% this year, down from 3%), and also delay VAT changes until after the summer. A review of the sustainability of the pension system would also be delated until the autumn. The plan would also see Greece\u2019s collective bargaining agreements reviewed in light of ILO guidance on \u2018best practice\u2019 to improve competitiveness and reduce unemployment. However, Greece would still implement the unpopular ENFIA property tax. In return, Greece\u2019s lenders would hand over \u20ac1.8bn of loans, plus the \u20ac1.9bn of profits that the ECB has made on its Greek bonds. Here\u2019s the story (in Greek). According to To Vima, the plan is designed to \u201ccut the Gordian knot\u201d. It would remove the immediate danger of default and buy time for more negotiations over a new reform programme. Paul Mason of Channel 4 is tweeting the key points now, along with some analysis: (re that last tweet, I think it actually unlocks around \u20ac4bn of aid -- but all will become clear later) Reuters has now published Pierre Moscovici\u2019s comments in Berlin this morning, in which the European Commissioner warned that time is running out: \u201cTime available to reach an agreement at staff level is now, I would say, very limited,\u201d said Moscovici. \u201cWe have got to conclude before the end of May.\u201d \u201cThe only scenario that we consider in the Commission is Greece in the euro zone,\u201d said the commissioner, adding that his political experience had taught him it was best not to discuss a Plan B \u201cbecause that means you don\u2019t believe in Plan A\u201d. Another day, another deadline. A quick recap. 1) Greece\u2019s government has warned that it needs to reach a breakthrough with its creditors to unlock bailout funds by the end of this month. Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis told reporters in Athens today that: \u201cA deal is required immediately, this is why we are talking about the end of May, to resolve these critical liquidity issues.\u201d Sakellaridis also insisted that Greece would not accept a one-off bank deposit levy to resolve the cash crisis, pledging no repeat of the Cyprus bailout of 2013. 2) Bank officials, though, fear that the very mention of a bail-in could encourage Greeks to tap their bank accounts. One told us: Many see it as the logical next step and after today\u2019s statement we expect the outflows to increase.\u201d 3) The European Commission has dampened Athens\u2019 hopes of a breakthrough could be achieved that a summit of EU leaders in Riga on Thursday. A political deal cannot replace the detailed technical negotiations needed to unlock bailout funds, an EC spokesman said. 4) Two leaks over the weekend have raised concerns over Greece\u2019s future. One showed that the IMF won\u2019t accept a \u201cquick and dirty\u201d fudge over the current aid programme, and fears that Greece can\u2019t meet this summer\u2019s repayments. The second leak revealed that Greece feared it couldn\u2019t meet last week\u2019s \u20ac750m repayment to the Fund [before eventually using emergency funds at the IMF]. 5) Uncertainty over Greece\u2019s future has hit its sovereign debt today, driving up bond yields. FXTM Market Analyst Jameel Ahmad explains: \u201cGreece is continuing to remain as a headline attraction in the news and unfortunately it is repeatedly for the wrong reasons. If it wasn\u2019t worrisome enough for investors that the Greek economy has basically allowed itself to slip back into a recession, then the reports that it only avoided a potential default to the IMF by using an emergency reserves account from the IMF, to repay the IMF, will send sentiment to new lows. 6) The German Bundesbank has also weighed in, warning that Greece faces insolvency if it doesn\u2019t take substantial reforms. Over in Athens, bank officials say they now expect more people to remove savings, despite the government promising today that it won\u2019t impose a levy on deposits. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: The government\u2019s pledge to leave bank accounts untouched in its battle to keep bankruptcy at bay does not appear to have convinced investors. Bank employees have been speaking of a marked increased in withdrawals by depositors in recent weeks. \u201cPeople are taking more or less everything they have got out of their accounts for fear that the government will be dipping into them next,\u201d said an official talking on condition of anonymity at the Bank of Greece. \u201cMany see it as the logical next step and after today\u2019s statement we expect the outflows to increase.\u201d Around \u20ac35bn is thought to have been withdrawn from Greek bank accounts since last December. Economists, politicians, bankers and officials are convinced that a Cyprus-style bail-in, if executed, would be the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. \u201cWe would see the revolt that this crisis has not yet produced. There would be blood in the streets. The Greeks are not like the Cypriots,\u201d added the Bank of Greece official. \u201cIt was wrong of the government to even raise it as a possibility and once again speaks more of its inexperience [in office].\u201d (reminder: in 2013, Cyprus imposed a levy on all depositors with more than \u20ac100,000 in their accounts, as part of its eurozone bailout) Meanwhile, prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 Syriza-led administration has been heavily criticised by former prime minister Antonis Samaras this morning. Addressing the Federation of Greek Industries convention, Samaras accused the government of not only endangering the country\u2019s future with increased talk of default and Grexit, but deluding Greeks. \u201cIt is a government of non-decisions and it is still telling lies to the people,\u201d said the head of the main opposition centre-right party, New Democracy. Samaras added: \u201cIt has promised everything to everyone and now it is telling lenders that they can\u2019t pay [maturing debt], essentially pre-announcing a credit event.\u201d Another flurry of newsflashes just landed, from European commissioner for economic affairs, Pierre Moscovici. He\u2019s trying to sound optimistic, saying that Greece and her creditors are closer to a \u201ccommon understanding\u201d, but warns that time is short. EU\u2019S MOSCOVICI SAYS EU AND GREECE HAVE MOVED CLOSER TO COMMON UNDERSTANDING IN A NUMBER OF AREAS EU\u2019S MOSCOVICI SAYS TIME FOR AGREEMENT IS LIMITED, ONLY WAY FOR SUSTAINABLE RECOVER FOR GREECE IS WITHIN EURO ZONE EU\u2019S MOSCOVICI SAYS THERE ARE SIGNALS THE GREEK GOV\u2019T IS ENGAGING MORE CONSTRUCTIVELY ON PRIVATISATIONS EU\u2019S MOSCOVICI SAYS EUROPEAN COMMISSION ONLY WORKING WITH SCENARIO OF GREECE STAYING IN EURO ZONE Germany\u2019s central bank has waded into the debate today, warning that Greece must make \u201csubstantial\u201d reforms to avoid falling into insolvency. The Bundesbank cited the Greek crisis in its regular monthly report, saying: \u201cThe current Greek government is obliged to make appropriate proposals, to implement those agreements that have been reached and thereby do their part to avoid the insolvency of the state, with strong repercussions for Greece. A sustainable solution is not possible without substantial reform in Greece.... The Bundesbank also urged policymakers to hold Greece to its commitments: Financial help should be linked to the relevant preconditions Greek government debt is taking a pummelling today. The yield (or interest rate) on two-year bonds has jumped from 21.1% to 24%, showing a higher risk that Athens could default on the debt. The European Commission has just dampened hopes of a political breakthrough when EU leaders gather in Latvia on Thursday and Friday. Margaritis Schinas, the EC\u2019s top spokesman, told reporters in Brussels that negotiations over Greece\u2019s reform programme have still not reached a deal, and are proceeding too slowly. EU COMMISSION SAYS PROGRESS IS MADE IN TALKS WITH GREECE, BUT AT A SLOW PACE AND MORE EFFORT NEEDED TO BRIDGE GAPS WHATEVER HAPPENS IN RIGA CANNOT BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR BRIDGING THE GAPS IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH GREECE- EU COMMISSION The Greek government\u2019s promise not to confiscate bank deposits has caused a flurry of concern among commentators and market experts: A snap summary of the Greek government\u2019s press briefing: And the markets don\u2019t like the sound of it; Germany\u2019s DAX has shed its early gains, and the FTSE 100 has now dipped into the red. Greek government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis added that Athens won\u2019t implement a \u201cCyprus-style\u201d solution, such as imposing losses on bank depositors. Newsflashes are coming in from Athens, showing that the Greek government hopes to reach a deal by the end of May. But spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis also insisted that Greece is still sticking to its \u201cred lines\u201d. And as flagged up earlier, the EU leaders\u2019 summit in Riga on Thursday and Friday is seen as crucial. GREEK GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SAYS FOUR RED LINES REMAIN IN TALKS WITH LENDERS - PENSION CUTS, GROWTH PLAN, PRIMARY SURPLUS TARGET AND DEBT RESTRUCTURING GREEK GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SAYS GOVT AIMS TO MAKE ALL PAYMENTS, WHEN ASKED ABOUT JUNE 5 IMF PAYMENT GREEK GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SAYS CONFIDENT DEAL WITH LENDERS WITH FALL WITHIN MANDATE SO BOTH COALITION PARTIES CAN SUPPORT IT GREEK GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SAYS WE ASSUME MAY IS THE MONTH WHEN TALKS WITH LENDERS WILL CONCLUDE Hope springs eternal, but I can\u2019t see how it translates into a deal unless there is compromise over those key economic reforms. Nor can Teneo Intelligence\u2019s Wolf Piccoli: The price of gold has hit a three-month high this morning, touching $1,230 per ounce for the first time since mid-February. Demand for gold has risen after last week\u2019s disappointing economic data, showing US consumer confidence and industrial production had dipped. But Sebastien Marlier, commodities analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, warns that this situation won\u2019t last: Gold will take a hit when the Fed eventually raises interest rates later this year.\u201d Two issues are looming over the UK this morning; Britain\u2019s position in Europe, and the new government\u2019s fiscal plans. Manufacturing firm JCB has shifted the tone of the debate over Brexit, saying Britain leave the European Union if David Cameron can\u2019t cut the red tape holding back UK firms. Britain\u2019s civil servants are bracing for hefty job cuts when George Osborne presents a new budget on July 8. Chocolate maker Thorntons has announced the departure of its CEO, following some disappointing financial results: And sales at sausage maker Cranswick are going with a bang. It reported today that revenues broke through the \u00a31bn mark for the first time, including a 23% jump in exports outside the European Union. A group of influential members of the Syriza coalition have called a meeting tomorrow to discuss whether Greece should split from its creditors, rather than swallow fresh austerity. Eurocrisis expert @GreekAnalyst reports that the gathering on Tuesday night will be attended by several \u201cprominent\u201d members of the left-wing group which won power in January, including: Antonis Davellos (SYRIZA Political Secretariat), John Millios (SYRIZA Central Committee), Sofi Papadogianni (SYRIZA Political Secretariat), Panos Lambrou (SYRIZA Political Secretariat), George Sapounas (SYRIZA Central Committee). The event captures the tensions at the heart of this crisis -- how can Syriza meet its pre-election pledges and stay true to its beliefs, while also committing to reforms that will allow its European partners to keep providing loans? Here\u2019s a flavour: We need to choose between the signing of the looming austerity agreement and the rupture with the lenders. SYRIZA cannot be turned into a party of austerity; neither can the government implement the Memorandum. This is the reason why, both domestically and abroad, proposals for the internal \u201ccleansing\u201d of SYRIZA and governmental solutions for \u201cnational unity\u201d are put on the table. For all those reasons, the only way out is the choice of rupture with the lenders. June is going to be a tense month, unless a deal does come soon. Greece\u2019s short-dated bonds are also weakening this morning: Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons a Greek breakthrough will come in time, but it\u2019s going to be a nailbiter.... The Athens stock market has fallen by 1.5% in early trading, as traders fret about the slow pace of progress. Financial shares are leading the fallers; the main banks are down at least 3%. Greek bonds are also suffering, following the news that the IMF fears Greece cannot meet its looming repayments (see opening post). The yield on 10-year government debt has risen to 11.3%, from 10.9% on Friday night, showing that Greece\u2019s debt is seen as riskier. Investors are pricing in a higher danger of default too: Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varouvakis, will give his views on the crisis tonight when he\u2019s interviewed on Greek TV. Enikos will be providing a simultaneous translation into English (they reckon it doesn\u2019t start until 11.30pm local time, alas) De Guindos added that Europe does not have a \u201cPlan B\u201d for Greece - it wants the country to stay in the eurozone, and meet its commitments. Spain\u2019s finance minister, Luis de Guindos, hasn\u2019t given up hope over Greece. He just told reporters in Madrid that an agreement can be reached in the coming days, despite so much time having been frittered away. Maria Tadeo, Bloomberg\u2019s Madrid correspondent, has tweeted the details: Greek fears appear to be weighing on the euro this morning. The single currency has lost half a cent against the US dollar in early trading, to $1.1398. Stan Shamu of IG reports that investors are cautious this morning: Greece will be front and centre this week as the country looks to secure a deal with its creditors while avoiding harsh austerity. Greece\u2019s government remains optimistic of a deal soon, perhaps at a summit meeting of EU leaders in Riga on Thursday and Friday. Nikos Filis, spokesman for the parliamentary group of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party, told the Mega TV that: \u201cWe\u2019re striving for a mutually beneficial agreement by Friday. However, Athens isn\u2019t capitulating over its red lines (as the IMF confirmed in that leaked document). Filis explained: \u201cOur mandate from the Greek people is to reach an agreement where we stay in the euro area without harsh austerity measures.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financal markets, the eurozone and business. Are we approaching the Greek endgame? Two documents published over the weekend show that Athens\u2019 financial situation is increasingly fraught, as time to reach a deal with its creditors runs out. The first missive came from the International Monetary Fund, and was leaked to Paul Mason of Channel 4 on Saturday. It shows that the Fund believes there is \u201cno possibility\u201d of Greece meeting the payments due over the summer unless some bailout funds are unlocked soon. The letter said there was still only limited progress between the two sides, while Greece is actually retreating on structural reforms. More here: IMF leak signals \u2018progress\u2019 with Greece, but threat of default in June And it also warns that IMF will not accept a \u201cquick and dirty\u201d compromise to resolve the deadlock -- suggesting it might not hand over its share of the \u20ac7bn in outstanding bailout funds. Sobering stuff. And that was compounded by news of a second letter, this time sent by Alexis Tsipras to the Fund last week, warning that Greece was almost out of cash. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel reports: Greece came so close to defaulting on last week\u2019s \u20ac750m International Monetary Fund repayment that the prime minister warned IMF chief Christine Lagarde he could not pay it without EU aid. Athens ultimately made the payment without financial assistance from the bloc but only by tapping a rarely used emergency account Greece holds at the fund \u2014 an unorthodox transaction that amounted to borrowing IMF funds to pay the IMF. Alexis Tsipras wrote to Ms Lagarde, warning that the IMF repayment would be missed unless the European Central Bank immediately raised its curbs on Greece\u2019s ability to issue short-term debt. More here: Tsipras letter reveals precariousness of Greece\u2019s finances As well as being \u2018unorthodox\u2019, the solution also can\u2019t be repeated -- meaning next month\u2019s payments are a new challenge: We\u2019ll be tracking all the main developments through the day....",

    "webTitle": "As the UK has discovered, there is no postindustrial promised land", 
    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "<p>In the 1950s, every region of Britain had industrial clout. Then came postindustrialism, a disastrous intellectual fad that has proved to be no substitute for advanced manufacturing</p>", 
      "body": "<p>Anyone puzzled by Scotland\u2019s increasing disaffection should take a look at a book called British Enterprise. Written by Alexander Howard and Ernest Newman, and published in 1952, the immediate afterglow of the festival of Britain, it consisted of short descriptions of each of more than 100 then world-beating British manufacturing companies.</p> <p>It strikingly illustrates how much more geographically balanced the British economy was in those days. In common with latter\u00adday Germany, every region of 1950s Britain had plenty of industrial prowess to boast of.</p> <p>The Midlands had the British car industry, the world\u2019s second-largest by total output and No 1 in exports. Wales had toys, steel, and domestic appliances; Nottingham had bicycles; Newcastle and Belfast led the world in key areas of heavy engineering; and, of course, Lancashire had cotton.</p> <p>Then there was Scotland. Its roll\u00adcall of exporting titans included Renfrew\u00ad-based Babcock and Wilcox, which made boilers for the world\u2019s power stations. Other major Scottish exporters included North British Locomotive and the William Beardmore castings company. In Dundee there was National Cash Register\u2019s major British subsidiary and in Kirkcaldy the Nairn linoleum company.</p> <p>The list went on and on, and at the top was the John Brown company. Although then one of the world\u2019s most technically advanced manufacturers, John Brown is largely forgotten today. Its products, however, are not. They included the Lusitania, HMS Repulse, the Queen Mary, the Queen Elizabeth, the QE2 and others. John Brown was the cornerstone of a Clydebank shipbuilding industry that built nearly a \u00adthird of the world\u2019s ships.</p> <p>All this was before the coming of postindustrialism, a superficially attractive but fundamentally disastrous intellectual fad. Espoused by London-\u00adbased elites in the 1970s and powerfully championed by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, postindustrialism postulates that sophisticated states no longer need manufacturing. Instead they should promptly move to a new promised land of postindustrial services.</p> <p>Unfortunately, as the Scots particularly have discovered, there is no promised land. With the exception of Edinburgh, whose financial services industry is the UK\u2019s second largest, the new postindustrial economy has proved no substitute for advanced manufacturing.</p> <p>For Scots, perhaps the most obvious evidence of postindustrialism\u2019s fallacies is in how the global shipbuilding industry has developed. As the Clydebank shipyards were closing a generation ago, Scots were told the industry was migrating to low-wage states and nothing could be done about it.</p> <p>A generation later, the facts are in: shipbuilding remains predominantly a developed world activity and the world\u2019s leading shipbuilders are based in places such as South Korea, Japan, and Scandinavia \u2013 states where, for the most part, blue\u00ad-collar wages are at least as high as in the UK.</p> <p>Postindustrialists often suggest their opponents want to return to the 1950s. In reality, of course, that world is gone and nothing can restore it. But this in no way diminishes the case for manufacturing. The fact is manufacturing evolves and so do the companies which engage in it.</p> <p>TakeToray of Tokyo. A humble maker of rayon in the 50s, it has long since graduated to higher things. These days it is noted mainly as a maker of carbon fibre, a hi-\u00adtech material that is vital in a host of applications from tennis rackets to space vehicles. It is, for instance, the key factor in the superlight wings of Boeing\u2019s 787, the most fuel-\u00adefficient passenger jet in history.</p> <p>Similarly, to take another impressive example, Zeiss of Germany has long since expanded far beyond basic photography.

      "bodyText": "Anyone puzzled by Scotland\u2019s increasing disaffection should take a look at a book called British Enterprise. Written by Alexander Howard and Ernest Newman, and published in 1952, the immediate afterglow of the festival of Britain, it consisted of short descriptions of each of more than 100 then world-beating British manufacturing companies. It strikingly illustrates how much more geographically balanced the British economy was in those days. In common with latterday Germany, every region of 1950s Britain had plenty of industrial prowess to boast of. The Midlands had the British car industry, the world\u2019s second-largest by total output and No 1 in exports. Wales had toys, steel, and domestic appliances; Nottingham had bicycles; Newcastle and Belfast led the world in key areas of heavy engineering; and, of course, Lancashire had cotton. Then there was Scotland. Its rollcall of exporting titans included Renfrew-based Babcock and Wilcox, which made boilers for the world\u2019s power stations. Other major Scottish exporters included North British Locomotive and the William Beardmore castings company. In Dundee there was National Cash Register\u2019s major British subsidiary and in Kirkcaldy the Nairn linoleum company. The list went on and on, and at the top was the John Brown company. Although then one of the world\u2019s most technically advanced manufacturers, John Brown is largely forgotten today. Its products, however, are not. They included the Lusitania, HMS Repulse, the Queen Mary, the Queen Elizabeth, the QE2 and others. John Brown was the cornerstone of a Clydebank shipbuilding industry that built nearly a third of the world\u2019s ships. All this was before the coming of postindustrialism, a superficially attractive but fundamentally disastrous intellectual fad. Espoused by London-based elites in the 1970s and powerfully championed by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, postindustrialism postulates that sophisticated states no longer need manufacturing. Instead they should promptly move to a new promised land of postindustrial services. Unfortunately, as the Scots particularly have discovered, there is no promised land. With the exception of Edinburgh, whose financial services industry is the UK\u2019s second largest, the new postindustrial economy has proved no substitute for advanced manufacturing. For Scots, perhaps the most obvious evidence of postindustrialism\u2019s fallacies is in how the global shipbuilding industry has developed. As the Clydebank shipyards were closing a generation ago, Scots were told the industry was migrating to low-wage states and nothing could be done about it. A generation later, the facts are in: shipbuilding remains predominantly a developed world activity and the world\u2019s leading shipbuilders are based in places such as South Korea, Japan, and Scandinavia \u2013 states where, for the most part, blue-collar wages are at least as high as in the UK. Postindustrialists often suggest their opponents want to return to the 1950s. In reality, of course, that world is gone and nothing can restore it. But this in no way diminishes the case for manufacturing. The fact is manufacturing evolves and so do the companies which engage in it. TakeToray of Tokyo. A humble maker of rayon in the 50s, it has long since graduated to higher things. These days it is noted mainly as a maker of carbon fibre, a hi-tech material that is vital in a host of applications from tennis rackets to space vehicles. It is, for instance, the key factor in the superlight wings of Boeing\u2019s 787, the most fuel-efficient passenger jet in history. Similarly, to take another impressive example, Zeiss of Germany has long since expanded far beyond basic photography. These days it is a dominant maker of high-precision lenses for key scientific, medical, and industrial applications. This includes so-called steppers \u2013 photo-optical machines that print circuit patterns on semiconductors. The manufacture of each new generation of semiconductor requires more precise photo-optics, which in turn means more precisely cut lenses. These latter can be almost as large as a car tyre and several of varying sizes are needed in each stepper. Advanced manufacturing scores over postindustrial services in three key ways \u2013 jobs, exports, and wages. The jobs point is self-explanatory: you don\u2019t need a PhD to work on a factory floor. As for exports, manufacturing scores in part because \u2013 at least at the advanced end of the business \u2013 manufactured products need little tailoring for different foreign markets. This applies in spades in the case of the sort of sophisticated components, advanced materials, and precision machine tools on which the export success of nations such as Japan and Germany is based. By contrast, in the computer software industry, for instance, the costs needed to adapt products for different foreign markets are generally incurred abroad and greatly cut into net export receipts. Another key point is that advanced manufacturing is generally capital-intensive, thus each worker\u2019s productivity is powerfully leveraged by the machinery he or she is working with. In some cases, the investment per worker may be as much as half a million pounds \u2013 an entry fee so high it guarantees that the only new entrants are in high-wage nations. Another plus is that advanced manufacturing involves industrial secrets acquired through years if not generations of learning by doing. Such secrets are typically known to only a few top engineers and cannot easily be reverse-engineered by new entrants to the industry. By contrast, services \u2013 even the most advanced \u2013 tend to be labour intensive and require little secret knowhow. Hence the drift of the computer software industry to India and Russia. None of this is much of a secret in Japan, where I have lived most of my adult life. In fact it was in a Tokyo bookshop that I happened upon that book I mentioned. Its previous owner was, I imagine, a Japanese official or corporate executive who bought it on an information-gathering mission to the UK in the early 1950s. He and his colleagues did their work well \u2013 so well that Japan is now a leader in virtually every industry that helped define British economic leadership in 1952. \u2022Eamonn Fingleton is the author of In Praise of Hard Industries: Why Manufacturing, Not the Information Economy, is the Key to Future Prosperity (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1999)",

The mobile communications company launched the second satellite for its Global Xpress high-capacity service in February and its third, called I-5 F3, was scheduled to go into orbit from Kazakhstan by early June. But on Saturday a rocket taking a satellite called Centenario into space for the Mexican government malfunctioned and both were destroyed. The Proton Breeze M rocket was the same as the model to be used by Inmarsat, delaying the UK company\u2019s launch until the fault is found. The Global Xpress programme is meant to provide ultra-fast broadband to governments and companies such as shipping operators and broadcasters wherever they are in the world. It has suffered a series of delays because of malfunctioning rockets and the latest glitch leaves Inmarsat waiting to include the Pacific region for its global coverage. Inmarsat said the delay would cause a small reduction in 2015 revenue and earnings. It withdrew its guidance for 8% to 12% compound annual growth in mobile satellite revenue from 2014 to 2016 but said it expected to hit a five-year target of $500m (\u00a3318m) extra revenue from Global Xpress. Rupert Pearce, the chief executive of Inmarsat, said: \u201cThis incident involving a failed Proton launch from the Baikonur cosmodrome is extremely unfortunate and will inevitably delay our launch plans for our third Global Xpress satellite. \u201cThis is the third time our Global Xpress programme has suffered launch delays because of Proton launch failures. Although in the past, Proton has returned to flight within a few months of a launch failure, it will not be possible to determine the length of the delay in the launch of I-5 F3 until the cause of the Centenario launch failure is established.\u201d He said customers were anxious for the Global Xpress service to expand worldwide and that the company would update them once it had a new launch date. Inmarsat shares have risen since the launch of the second Global Xpress satellite in February, hitting a record of \u00a310.22 on 8 May. The shares fell 3% to 965p on Monday morning.",

      "bodyText": "The US Congress could soon pass legislation to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which may result in the 12-nation trade deal being passed within a fortnight. President Barack Obama needs the Trade Promotion Authority to fast-track trade talks between TPP nations, which account for nearly 40% of the global economy. Australia is one of those nations. Trade Promotion Authority would give the president the power to negotiate an agreement that Congress would then be able to approve or block, but not amend. In a surprising development, the president has the support of his Republican opponents in granting the authority, but faces opposition from Democrats. A procedural vote on the Trade Promotion Authority was narrowly blocked in the Senate by Democrats last week, despite Obama making it one the centrepieces of his presidency. The head of the Influential Ways and Means Committee, Republican Paul Ryan, said Obama now has the congressional votes to win the debate, with US Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell saying that would happen by the end of this week. \u201cThese sorts of sentiments are now starting to pervade the hill in Washington, and if that\u2019s true it would pave the way to possibly conclude negotiations by all 12 countries in the following fortnight,\u201d the Australian trade minister, Andrew Robb, told ABC Radio on Monday. Passing the authority legislation would give the other 11 signatory countries confidence, the trade minister said, adding that failing to pass the legislation soon will stall the TPP\u2019s progress. \u201cI think there\u2019d be one window in June [to pass the legislation] from what I understand, but every month that goes by the more the chance is of this issue becoming even more politicised in the United States as they head towards the next presidential election,\u201d Robb said. Very little is known about the content of the secretive trade deal and it is, from the American perspective, a way of extending the US\u2019s influence in Asia. Formal negotiations on the deal began in 2010, and it is believed to contain clauses allowing companies and investors to take legal action against signatory states. The investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions would allow for more litigation against domestic law by multinationals, similar to that undertaken by tobacco companies against the Australian government over claims their copyright was breached by plain packaging for cigarettes. Labor does not support ISDS provisions, but has stopped short of saying their inclusion in the TPP would be a deal-breaker for passing domestic laws. \u201cLabor will assess any TPP agreement once it has been finalised and all the details have been publicly released,\u201d a spokewoman for shadow trade minister Penny Wong said. The government has indicated in the past it will consider including ISDS provisions in trade agreements on a case-by-case basis. \u201cWe would remind Labor that they have previously concluded trade deals which contained ISDS provisions on the basis that they provide some levels of assurance for Australian investors in those markets that perhaps have unreliable legal systems,\u201d a spokesman for Robb told Guardian Australia. \u201cLabor ultimately supported the Korean and Chinese free trade agreements which did include ISDS provisions.\u201d \u201cIf agreements like TPP produce positive benefits in terms of growth, job creation and living standards we would hope Labor sees fit to provide bipartisan support. Trade agreements such as TPP undergo parliamentary inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties prior to ratification,\u201d the spokesman said. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry wants ISDS clauses to stay, arguing they exist in trade agreements between Australia and more than half of the Pacific rim countries currently negotiating the TPP. \u201cISDS provisions are a long-standing feature of trade agreements and support Australian firms by ensuring they can protect their financial interests from interference due to unpredictable government decisions when they are engaged in foreign markets,\u201d the chief executive officer, Kate Carnell, said. Trade ministers involved in TPP talks will meet next week to continue negotiations.",

Hart joined Thorntons in January 2011 from Caffe Nero, the coffee chain, where he was managing director.

There were signs the strategy was working in September when Thorntons announced a 60% rise in annual profit but the improved performance was based on cost cutting while sales barely increased. The day before Christmas Eve, Thorntons warned that annual profit would fall because of lower than expected orders from supermarkets and problems at its new warehouse. In March, the Derbyshire-based company announced full-year profit down almost 10% to \u00a36.5m and revenues down 8%, saying its performance was disappointing.

      "bodyText": "Tony Abbott has sought to reassure wary colleagues and big mining companies that any government-backed inquiry into Australia\u2019s iron ore sector would be a fact-finding mission rather than an attempt to regulate the market. The prime minister said on Monday a parliamentary inquiry \u201cmay well be a very good way\u201d to sift through various claims about the iron ore market, but it was important that the terms of reference be framed in a way to avoid a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d against particular companies. The comments followed concerns from some ministers that a parliamentary inquiry would send the wrong signal to Australia\u2019s trading partners. But the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, who is based in Western Australia, appeared to be comfortable with an inquiry so long as it was \u201chandled maturely in a responsible fashion\u201d. The push is being championed by the WA-based chairman of Fortescue Metals Group, Andrew Forrest, who has accused Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton of increasing iron-ore production to reduce prices and damage smaller competitors. Rio Tinto and BHP have rejected this criticism. After reports that at least two ministers \u2013 Andrew Robb and Ian Macfarlane \u2013 were opposed to a government-backed inquiry, Abbott sought to allay concerns. The prime minister said iron ore was one of Australia\u2019s \u201cabsolutely critical industries\u201d and it was important to know what was happening in the sector. \u201cI think it is important to get to the facts and an inquiry may well be a very good way of doing that,\u201d he said during a visit to Mackay in Queensland. \u201cIf we are going to have an inquiry it has got to be a fair inquiry; it can\u2019t be a witch-hunt, it can\u2019t be directed against any particular company or companies \u2013 it has got to be fair and square and reasonable.\u201d Abbott added that the government would not make \u201cany attempt to regulate a market which is working well\u201d and \u201cthe last thing we want to do is to crackdown on people\u2019s creativity\u201d. WA Liberal backbencher Dennis Jensen said he did not think an inquiry was a good idea, arguing Australia could not be viewed in isolation and it should be up to the companies to decide the rate of production. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a free market, you\u2019ve got a free market,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what information an inquiry is going to give you apart from the observation that some miners have lower quality resources than others and with a low iron ore price it means that some operations become marginal.\u201d Macfarlane, the industry minister, said cabinet was yet to make a final decision on an inquiry and he would express his views directly to his colleagues. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait and see the outcome of that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure all of those views will be discussed in cabinet and as a result of that cabinet discussion a proposal will be put to the party room.\u201d Robb, the trade minister, said he expected a decision \u201cin the next week or so\u201d. \u201cThe leadership group have, quite appropriately, been canvassing views, various views amongst various colleagues,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cI\u2019ve put my views, as others have, to the leadership group.\u201d The independent senator Nick Xenophon gave notice last week that he would move a motion in the Senate to set up an iron-ore inquiry, but did not press ahead with it after discussions with the treasurer, Joe Hockey.

Australia\u2019s reputation as a supporter of open markets, he said, had \u201calready been undermined by calls to cap iron ore production and for government intervention in the market\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Last week\u2019s budget attempted to show a path back to surplus. But it is a questionable path based on spending cuts from last year that have not yet passed, cuts to state funding that have yet to be agreed and projected taxation where revenue returns would need to be at the levels of the Howard years. The dependence upon strong taxation growth from income and company tax however also throws into question the government\u2019s taxation review. Having already ruled out a number of changes to the tax system, the reliance on revenue growth means any changes to income and company taxes will almost certainly destroy chances of a return to surplus. When Joe Hockey released the \u201cBetter Tax\u201d discussion paper the rhetoric at first was that very much that everything was up for discussion. For example, unlike the ALP\u2019s tax review conducted by then treasury secretary, Ken Henry, this review would consider GST. But very quickly it became clear that being \u201con the table\u201d for discussion did not mean it was on the table for consideration. It did not take long for Joe Hockey to rule out changes to negative gearing. Despite pretty clear evidence that the removal of negative gearing in the 1980s didn\u2019t cause rents to rise, the treasurer has continued to peddle this as truth. In the run-up to the budget when Labor\u2019s Chris Bowen told ABC\u2019s Leigh Sales that Labor would take \u201cany changes we took to negative gearing\u201d to the next election, Joe Hockey quickly ruled out any changes. He told the media the following day, \u201cIf you change negative gearing, then there are significant flow-on consequences from people that rent homes\u201d. He suggested that the tax discussion paper means \u201cwe are having a national conversation about taxation\u201d \u2013 which sounded very open minded, except he then threw in a very big \u201cbut\u201d: \u201cbut I\u2019d say this. A lot of Australians have invested their hard earned money in real estate, and in doing so, they have offset the losses of that real estate against their primary income in order to give themselves and their children some financial security\u201d. And just to make clear his position, he again brought up rents by arguing that \u201cthere is a very strong argument that if you were to abolish negative gearing, you would see a significant increase in rents. For a lot of people, a massive increase in rents is so unaffordable\u201d. But of course, it\u2019s all on the table... Another area was superannuation. After the tax discussion paper was introduced Hockey appeared at least open to the idea of changing taxation concessions on superannuation. He told ABC\u2019s John Faine that he \u201cwould love to have a bipartisan approach in all these issues\u201d and that the interaction of pension aged care and superannuation were \u201cunder very active consideration at the moment.\u201d But very quickly, once the ALP began mooting changes to the superannuation tax concessions, Joe Hockey toed the Liberal Party\u2019s line that the ALP just wanted to raise tax. On 22 April he compared it with the mining tax and the carbon tax and told reports that \u201cLabor\u2019s default position is always to increase taxes\u201d. By the budget last Tuesday he was firmer \u2013 \u201cthere will be no new taxes on superannuation under this government\u201d. So cross that off the list of items on the table. The problem for Joe Hockey is that his budget seeks to get back to surplus on the basis of getting a chunk more income tax than in the past. This year the government expects to raise $176.6bn in total individual income tax. By 2018-19 this is expected to rise to $234.8bn: By 2018-19 individual income tax revenue will have risen to 12.1% of GDP \u2013 the highest level since the GST was introduced in July 2000. In the same period the level of company tax revenue is expected to increase by 27% in dollar terms, and from 4.1% of GDP in 2015-16 to 4.4% of GDP: This also means that the budget is becoming more dependent upon income and company tax: In 2013-14 individual income tax, company taxes and resources rent taxes accounted for 68.7% of all tax revenue. By 2017-18 that will rise to 70.9%. But this brings with it problems that have already been highlighted by Hockey\u2019s own tax review discussion paper as well as the OECD. Within the OECD, Australia is one of the most dependent upon income and company tax revenue: The tax discussion paper highlighted that one problem with a reliance on income tax is that bracket creep can reduce people\u2019s propensity to work. The over-reliance on company tax is also a problem given companies\u2019 ability to move profits around and avoid paying tax, as well as the need to attract foreign investment by lowering tax when other countries company tax rates are going down. And yet growth in income tax and company tax are the major foundations upon which Joe Hockey\u2019s path to surplus is paved. In his budget reply speech Bill Shorten made mention of the bracket creep and he told Leigh Sales that he was willing to sit down with Tony Abbott and \u201clook at all of what we\u2019ve got to do and see what we can do collectively.\u201d But to give an idea of the problems of collecting revenue from income, were the level of income tax kept steady at the current 11% of GDP rather than rising to 12.1%, the government would raise around $53.3bn less in tax over the next four years: By 2018-19 alone, around $21bn less in tax would be raised if the level of tax as a percentage of GDP was kept steady. That is about a quarter of the $86.2bn in GST that is expected to be raised in 2018-19. So if Hockey or Abbott or Shorten wish to fix bracket creep by cutting income tax, they are going to need to find a fair stack of money elsewhere to remain on track for a surplus. But Tony Abbott last week ruled out any changes to superannuation tax arguing in parliament that the ALP \u201call live on Planet Tax. There\u2019s their carbon tax, their mining tax, there\u2019s all the superannuation taxes.\u201d And yet the prime minister has pretty much also ruled out any changes to the GST. In January he told reporters that \u201cthere will be no changes to the GST in the first term of the Coalition government. We have no plans to change the GST.\u201d Moreover, in December last year Joe Hockey told Channel 7 that there was not the \u201cthe financial capacity\u201d to change the GST. He noted correctly that \u201cif you increase the GST, you need to compensate middle and low-income Australians with significant tax cuts\u201d. And that would be tax cuts to the very tax that Hockey needs to keep growing to achieve his surplus. As I noted last week the path to a surplus is pretty rocky, but the budget has also made the path to any tax reform nigh on impossible.",

By 2018-19 this is expected to rise to $234.8bn:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/lSnIN/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>By 2018-19 individual income tax revenue will have risen to 12.1% of GDP \u2013 the highest level since the GST was introduced in July 2000.</p> <p>In the same period the level of company tax revenue is expected to increase by 27% in dollar terms, and from 4.1% of GDP in 2015-16 to 4.4% of GDP:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/o5Q9v/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This also means that the budget is becoming more dependent upon income and company tax:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/sKuXH/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In 2013-14 individual income tax, company taxes and resources rent taxes accounted for 68.7% of all tax revenue. By 2017-18 that will rise to 70.9%.</p> <p>But this brings with it problems that have already been highlighted by Hockey\u2019s own <a href=\"http://bettertax.gov.au/publications/discussion-paper/\">tax review discussion paper</a> as well as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/feb/24/oecd-prescription-is-a-hard-pill-for-joe-hockey-to-swallow\">OECD</a>.</p> <p>Within the OECD, Australia is one of the most dependent upon income and company tax revenue:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 5\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/KyHyJ/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The tax discussion paper highlighted that one problem with a reliance on income tax is that bracket creep can reduce people\u2019s propensity to work.</p> <p>The over-reliance on company tax is also a problem given companies\u2019 ability to move profits around and avoid paying tax, as well as the need to attract foreign investment by lowering tax when other countries company tax rates are going down.</p> <p>And yet growth in income tax and company tax are the major foundations upon which Joe Hockey\u2019s path to surplus is paved.</p> <p>In his budget reply speech Bill Shorten made mention of the bracket creep and he told <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4236048.htm\">Leigh Sales</a> that he was willing to sit down with Tony Abbott and \u201clook at all of what we\u2019ve got to do and see what we can do collectively.\u201d</p> <p>But to give an idea of the problems of collecting revenue from income, were the level of income tax kept steady at the current 11% of GDP rather than rising to 12.1%, the government would raise around $53.3bn less in tax over the next four years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 10\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/cFaaP/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>By 2018-19 alone, around $21bn less in tax would be raised if the level of tax as a percentage of GDP was kept steady. That is about a quarter of the $86.2bn in GST that is expected to be raised in 2018-19.</p> <p>So if Hockey or Abbott or Shorten wish to fix bracket creep by cutting income tax, they are going to need to find a fair stack of money elsewhere to remain on track for a surplus.</p> <p>But Tony Abbott last week ruled out any changes to superannuation tax arguing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/13/budget-2015-tony-abbott-creates-new-attack-line-ruling-out-tax-increases\">in parliament</a> that the ALP \u201call live on Planet Tax. There\u2019s their carbon tax, their mining tax, there\u2019s all the superannuation taxes.\u201d</p> <p>And yet the prime minister has pretty much also ruled out any changes to the GST. <a href=\"http://www.pm.gov.au/media/2015-01-05/doorstop-interview-united-arab-emirates\">In January</a> he told reporters that \u201cthere will be no changes to the GST in the first term of the Coalition government. We have no plans to change the GST.\u201d</p> <p>Moreover, in December last year Joe Hockey <a href=\"http://jbh.ministers.treasury.gov.au/transcript/144-2014/\">told Channel 7</a> that there was not the \u201cthe financial capacity\u201d to change the GST. He noted correctly that \u201cif you increase the GST, you need to compensate middle and low-income Australians with significant tax cuts\u201d.</p> <p>And that would be tax cuts to the very tax that Hockey needs to keep growing to achieve his surplus.</p> <p>As I noted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/may/15/an-economic-hiccup-could-easily-derail-hockeys-path-back-to-a-surplus\">last week</a> the path to a surplus is pretty rocky, but the budget has also made the path to any tax reform nigh on impossible. </p>",
