      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond would need to spend an extra \u00a333bn a year to \u201cend austerity\u201d according to a leading tax and spending watchdog. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the chancellor could use his autumn budget to reverse major cuts scheduled to hit public spending and still keep the government\u2019s spending deficit at 2.4% of GDP by 2021. To meet a target of balancing the budget in the middle of the next decade, the IFS warned that the Treasury would need to return to its spending squeeze if the economy, as expected, only grows modestly in the aftermath of leaving the European Union, limiting the growth of tax receipts. The analysis has been released as ministers prepare to battle with the chancellor to protect their departments before the autumn budget. The chancellor has warned that government finances remain vulnerable in the event of another financial shock and the Treasury\u2019s task must remain to bring down the deficit over the next parliament. Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, said: \u201cAn \u2018end to austerity\u2019 \u2013 as defined by no further net tax rises, benefit cuts or cuts to spending on public services \u2013 would require a very sharp change of direction. \u201cIt would imply a \u00a317bn boost to planned spending on public services alongside a \u00a35bn net tax cut and an \u00a311bn increase in planned benefit spending \u2013 ie a giveaway of \u00a333bn a year. [That] would, on current forecasts, leave us with a deficit at its current level \u2013 2.4% of GDP \u2013 in 2021-22.\u201d Emmerson said relaxing the spending squeeze was \u201can option in a way that it was not an option back in 2010\u201d. But he warned that it would leave the chancellor with \u201cless room for manoeuvre\u201d if growth stalled as a result of Brexit. Revisions to figures for the public deficit, which soared to 9.9% of national income in 2009-10 after the financial crisis, have shown it fell to 2.4% last year and is the lowest it has been since 2003-04. Labour has argued that a deficit of 2.4% is low enough to continue to bring down the overall debt-to-GDP ratio. Emmerson, who unveiled his analysis at the Institute for Government in London, appeared to agree when he said: \u201cWe could choose to continue to run deficits of around the current level over the longer term. If the economy were to grow as expected, this would be sufficient to see debt fall as a share of national income over the longer term. \u201cIt would mean that over the next few years household incomes could be better supported and a greater quality and quantity of public services could be enjoyed. But it would also involve planning to live with elevated public sector debt for longer. \u201cIt could give the chancellor less room for manoeuvre if the economy were to suffer badly, for Brexit-related or other reasons, over the next few years. And it would almost certainly require the abandonment of the pledge to eliminate the deficit in the mid-2020s.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "There goes \u00a34.2bn from our (mostly) state-owned bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, to cover the first of two big settlements with US authorities for mis-selling toxic mortgage bonds in the bad old days. The sum to be dispatched to the US Federal Housing Finance Agency is roughly the size RBS had expected, which at least shows that today\u2019s directors are good at judging how severely their predecessors\u2019 mistakes will be punished. Throw in another billion, or two, or three, to settle later with the US Department of Justice, and one of RBS\u2019s many disgraceful chapters will close. So, yes, if one takes the cheerful view, another \u201clegacy issue\u201d \u2013 as the bank\u2019s chief executive, Ross McEwan, calls them \u2013 is being resolved. Bring on the dividends for us shareholders, then? Unfortunately not \u2013 or not yet. The depressing reality is that RBS still can\u2019t say confidently when it will pay a dividend. McEwan offered a four-point checklist of necessary conditions, and RBS can\u2019t put a firm tick against any. On mortgage-backed securities, the bank is waiting for the DoJ, which moves at its own speed. Meanwhile, the UK Treasury is trying to extract RBS from its commitment to the EU to sell 300 branches, but the plan is already five months old. Then RBS has to pass this year\u2019s stress tests on banks\u2019 capital buffers at a time when regulators are in a fretful mood. And the bank has to make a profit, which we already know won\u2019t happen this year. The City hopes that profits will appear in 2018 for the first time in a decade, to allow a dividend to be paid in 2019. One wishes McEwan luck, but we\u2019ve learned from experience with RBS to believe it only when we see it. Not for the first time, one is left with the sinking feeling that rehabilitating RBS would have been easier to manage if the bank had been split between its good and bad parts at the moment of bailout in 2008. Too late now. BT is stuck on the auditing merry-go-round One in five shareholders in BT can\u2019t wait to get rid of PricewaterhouseCoopers as auditor. The firm has already been told it will be fired, to be replaced by KPMG, but the effective date is next year, not this. Some 21% of investors voted against PwC anyway. You can\u2019t blame them. The thumping \u00a3530m provision to cover \u201cimproper\u201d practices and \u201cfinancial irregularities\u201d in BT\u2019s Italian division came to light in January, after a whistleblower, rather than PwC, spotted the mismanagement. That shouldn\u2019t happen at a large FTSE 100 company. For good measure, all four members of BT\u2019s audit committee received a minor kick in the form of votes against ranging from 8% to 12%. That\u2019s fair, too, especially as the chair, Nick Rose, found it easier in his report to shareholders to describe the committee\u2019s \u201csubstantial disappointment\u201d about events in Italy than to apologise for them. Why, though, couldn\u2019t PwC be dismissed instantly? BT says it wanted to \u201caccelerate\u201d the appointment of a new auditor in March, but was told by the Financial Reporting Council this was not possible under \u201cauditor independence and tender rules\u201d. Translation: other big auditing firms had done non-auditing work for BT in the recent past and had to wait to be considered independent. Second translation: the FTSE 100 auditing world, dominated by just four big firms, is an uncompetitive stitch-up. SFO\u2019s Amec investigation could alter Wood Group\u2019s intentions Wood Group, the oil services firm, prides itself on being a conservative Aberdonian outfit that would not rush into a deal without assessing the risks. One hopes this self-image is justified. Amec Foster Wheeler, the rival Wood is in the process of buying for \u00a32.2bn, said late on Tuesday that it was being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. In itself, that development was not a surprise, since the risk, arising from the SFO\u2019s investigation into Unaoil, the Monaco-based energy consultant, was signalled in the merger document. The deal is still on, both sides say. One assumes that Wood is sincere and won\u2019t try to back out. But the wording of its warning to shareholders is stark: \u201cIt is not possible to estimate reliably what effect the outcome of this matter may have on Amec Foster Wheeler.\u201d Would you really want to proceed when you have to say that?",

      "bodyText": "A high court judge has joked that the legal dispute over what Sports Direct billionaire Mike Ashley allegedly said during a drunken night out to a London pub is \u201ca lot more interesting\u201d than most dry business disputes that reach the courts. Mr Justice Leggatt was on Wednesday hearing closing arguments in a dispute between Ashley and his former colleague Jeff Blue, who claims that the tracksuits and trainers tycoon promised him a \u00a315m pay deal during \u201ca big night out with the lads\u201d. Leggatt has listened to hours of extraordinary evidence delving into Ashley\u2019s \u201cunorthodox\u201d business practices, including taking naps under the table during \u201cboring\u201d meetings and proudly being such a \u201cpower drinker\u201d that he once allegedly vomited into a fireplace to the applause of colleagues. David Cavender QC, who is representing Ashley, told the court that there was \u201ca degree of surrealism that this really is a case in the commercial courts about an agreement in a pub. We have all enjoyed it enormously.\u201d Leggatt replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more interesting than some other cases.\u201d Blue\u2019s lawyer, Jeffrey Chapman QC, told the judge that Ashley often conducted business in pubs, casinos and various other \u201cunusual venues\u201d while under the influence of alcohol and the meeting\u2019s venue should not invalidate the alleged deal. Chapman described Ashley, the 54th wealthiest person in the UK according to the Sunday Times rich list, as an \u201cextraordinary, larger-than-life, self-made billionaire. He is a power-drinking money-making machine.\u201d He said Ashley would frequently make business deals while under the influence of alcohol and agreements would often be only verbal, with no written record. \u201cMr Blue has seen Mr Ashley in action over the years, doing business in pubs, hotel bars and casinos,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s rich and Sports Direct was, and is, his company to do with pretty much what he likes. \u201cThe deal he entered into with Mr Blue was, like so many of his deals, a brilliant one for Mike Ashley.\u201d Blue claims that during a night of heavy drinking in the Horse and Groom in Fitzrovia, central London, in January 2013 Ashley agreed to pay him \u00a315m if Sports Direct\u2019s shares doubled to \u00a38. The shares did hit \u00a38 but have since collapsed, in part because of reputational damage caused by a Guardian investigation that revealed the retailer was in effect paying staff in its warehouse less than the minimum wage. A report by MPs later accused Ashley of running Sports Direct like a Victorian workhouse. Blue was paid a \u00a31m bonus, which Ashley claims was unrelated to the alleged pub deal. Blue claims the only explanation for the \u00a31m bonus is that it was a downpayment on the alleged agreement and he is suing Ashley for the \u00a314m balance. Ashley has said he does not recall the conversation because he had downed the first four pints of the session in about an hour, and that if he did make any such share price-based deal it would have been just \u201cdrunk banter\u201d. Leggatt said he would deliver a judgment on Monday or Tuesday.",

      "body": "<p>A high court judge has joked that the legal dispute over what Sports Direct billionaire Mike Ashley allegedly said during a drunken night out to a London pub is \u201ca lot more interesting\u201d than most dry business disputes that reach the courts.</p> <p>Mr Justice Leggatt was on Wednesday hearing closing arguments in a dispute between Ashley and his former colleague Jeff Blue, who claims that the tracksuits and trainers tycoon promised him a \u00a315m pay deal during \u201ca big night out with the lads\u201d. </p> <p>Leggatt has listened to hours of extraordinary evidence delving into Ashley\u2019s \u201cunorthodox\u201d business practices, including taking naps under the table during \u201cboring\u201d meetings and proudly being such a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/06/mike-ashley-high-court-sports-direct-newcastle-united\">power drinker</a>\u201d that he once allegedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/03/sports-direct-founder-pubs-mike-ashley\">vomited into a fireplace to the applause of colleagues</a>. </p> <p>David Cavender QC, who is representing Ashley, told the court that there was \u201ca degree of surrealism that this really is a case in the commercial courts about an agreement in a pub. We have all enjoyed it enormously.\u201d Leggatt replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more interesting than some other cases.\u201d</p> <p>Blue\u2019s lawyer, Jeffrey Chapman QC, told the judge that Ashley often conducted business in pubs, casinos and various other \u201cunusual venues\u201d while under the influence of alcohol and the meeting\u2019s venue should not invalidate the alleged deal.</p> <p>Chapman described Ashley, the 54th wealthiest person in the UK according to the Sunday Times rich list, as an \u201cextraordinary, larger-than-life, self-made billionaire. He is a power-drinking money-making machine.\u201d </p> <p>He said Ashley would frequently make business deals while under the influence of alcohol and agreements would often be only verbal, with no written record. \u201cMr Blue has seen Mr Ashley in action over the years, doing business in pubs, hotel bars and casinos,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s rich and Sports Direct was, and is, his company to do with pretty much what he likes.</p> <p>\u201cThe deal he entered into with Mr Blue was, like so many of his deals, a brilliant one for Mike Ashley.\u201d</p> <p>Blue claims that during a night of heavy drinking in the Horse and Groom in Fitzrovia, central London, in January 2013 Ashley agreed to pay him \u00a315m if Sports Direct\u2019s shares doubled to \u00a38. The shares did hit \u00a38 but have since collapsed, in part because of reputational damage caused by a Guardian investigation that revealed the retailer was in effect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">paying staff in its warehouse less than the minimum wage.</a> A report by MPs later accused Ashley of running Sports Direct like a Victorian workhouse.</p> <p>Blue was paid a \u00a31m bonus, which Ashley claims was unrelated to the alleged pub deal. Blue claims the only explanation for the \u00a31m bonus is that it was a downpayment on the alleged agreement and he is suing Ashley for the \u00a314m balance. </p> <p>Ashley has said he does not recall the conversation because he had downed the first four pints of the session in about an hour, and that if he did make any such share price-based deal it would have been just \u201cdrunk banter\u201d. </p> <p>Leggatt said he would deliver a judgment on Monday or Tuesday. </p>",

    "webTitle": "UK real wage squeeze continues; Yellen testimony boosts markets - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally.... Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony to lawmakers on Capitol Hill didn\u2019t yield many fireworks. The Fed chair told the House Financial Committee that she was determined to serve our her term but hadn\u2019t thought about a second one (Donald Trump has hinted that he might replace Yellen). She repeated some comments from her prepared testimony, such that the \u2018new normal\u2019 on neutral interest rates is probably lower than in the past. Yellen also put her finger on another important issue - that wages aren\u2019t rising as fast as you\u2019d expect. She suggests low productivity is one factor. She wouldn\u2019t be lured into whether the markets are in a bubble right now, beyond pointing out that valuations are at the top of historical ranges. And she did get one cheeky shot in. When asked about the $19 trillion US debt mountain (displayed on a wall behind her), the world\u2019s most powerful central banker reminded her inquisitors that this is a government matter.... As she put it: \u201cI believe a key thing that Congress should be taking into account in designing fiscal policy is the need to achieve sustainability in the debt path over time\u201d. And on that note, goodnight! GW Janet Yellen has lessened expectations of a steep ascent of US rates, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to new alltime highs. Joshua Mahony of IG says the Fed chair has cheered investors: Stocks are back in the swing of things, with the Dow hitting new record highs in the wake of a dovish testimony from Janet Yellen in Washington. To some extent Yellen provided a relatively hawkish statement given her declaration that rate hikes should continue despite falling inflation. However, in speculating that it would not take many more hikes for the Fed funds rate to be neutral, Yellen has essentially signalled that there will be a finite amount of rate rises around the corner. Markets are now looking for a December rate hike at the earliest, and crucially just one rate rise in 2018. Here\u2019s my colleague Angela Monaghan on the main story of the morning, Britain\u2019s labour market report: UK consumers are suffering a sustained fall in living standards as real pay fell again in the three months to May, piling more pressure on cash-strapped households. Regular pay adjusted to account for the impact of inflation fell by 0.5% year on year over the period, shrinking family incomes and signalling a weaker outlook for consumer spending. It followed a 0.6% drop in real pay in the three months to April, and a 0.4% fall in the previous three months, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. Real pay fell despite a surprise drop in the unemployment rate from 4.6% to 4.5%, which was the lowest since May to July 1975. The employment rate rose to 74.9%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said the government must intervene to address the pay squeeze. \u201cThree months of falling pay is three months too many. The clock is ticking while workers wait for the government to act,\u201d she said. \u201cMinisters must set out a plan to get real wages rising across the public and the private sectors. They should start by scrapping the unfair pay restrictions on nurses, midwives and other public sector workers. And the minimum wage must be raised to \u00a310 as quickly as possible.\u201d... More here: The Canadian dollar is rallying on the back of the rate hike..... Here\u2019s some reaction to the Bank of Canada\u2019s rate hike Canada\u2019s interest rate hike was generally expected, and is another sign that central bankers are moving towards normalising monetary policy. In a statement the Bank of Canada says growth is strengthening across the economy and becoming more sustainable. The BoC adds: Recent data have bolstered the bank\u2019s confidence in its outlook for above-potential growth and the absorption of excess capacity in the economy. The Bank acknowledges recent softness in inflation but judges this to be temporary.\u201d NEWSFLASH: Canadian interest rates have been hiked for the first time in seven years. The Bank of Canada has voted to raise borrowing costs by a quarter-point, from 0.5% to 0.75%. The markets often get excited when a central banker hits the headlines. And on this occasion, Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Economics reckons they\u2019ve got over-excited by Yellen\u2019s comments about inflation \u2018uncertainty\u2019. He tweets: Up she goes... Shares are rallying in New York at the start of trading, as Wall Street absorbs Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony to Congress. The Dow gained almost 100 points at the start of trading, and is getting very close to its previous record closing high. Traders seem to be encouraged by Yellen\u2019s upbeat comments about the US recovery, and her caution on inflation \u2018uncertainty\u2019. That\u2019s been seen as a signal that the Fed won\u2019t hike borrowing costs too aggressively, especially as Yellen says rate rises will be \u2018gradual\u2019. European markets are also getting a boost, with the FTSE 100 now up 80 points at 7410. Capital Economics argus that Yellen hasn\u2019t really said anything very new: Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s prepared remarks, released ahead of her semi-annual testimony today, offered no new insights on the timing of either the next hike in interest rates or when balance sheet normalisation would begin. This is not a complete surprise, however, since it is still too early for the Fed to tip its hand on what it will do at September\u2019s FOMC meeting. It makes a lot more sense to wait and absorb another couple of months\u2019 worth of data, before providing a stronger steer to the markets around the time of the Jackson Hole conference. But sometimes, no news is good news.... so bonds, commodities and emerging market currencies are also having a better day as the dollar dips. The US dollar has dropped after Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony hit the wires. Traders seem to be focusing on the Fed Chair\u2019s cautious comments about inflation, and the fact she highlighted it is below the Fed\u2019s target of around 2%. That could be seen as a hint that interest rates won\u2019t rise as quickly as the markets had expected (reminder, the last hike was in June). Newsflash: The world\u2019s most powerful central banker, Janet Yellen of the Federal Reserve, has just released her testimony to the US Congress. In it, Yellen says that the US labour market has continued to recover since her last testimony, in February. The economy appears to have grown at a moderate pace, on average, so far this year, she adds. And that means that interest rates will probably keep rising. As Yellen puts it: The Committee continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achieve and maintain maximum employment and stable prices. However, the Fed chair also emphasis that inflation is below target. She singles it out as a particular \u2018uncertainty\u2019 that could affect monetary policy. She says: Inflation continues to run below our 2 percent objective and has declined recently; the Committee will be monitoring inflation developments closely in the months ahead. Breaking! Royal Bank of Scotland is paying over \u00a34bn to America\u2019s Federal Housing Finance Agency to resolve long-running inquiry. It relates to the misselling of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis (before RBS almost collapsed, and was bailed out by the taxpayer). Ross McEwan, RBS CEO, says: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is an important step forward in resolving one of the most significant legacy matters facing RBS and is further evidence of the determination of the bank\u2019s leadership to put our remaining issues behind us. \u201cThis settlement is a stark reminder of what happened to this bank before the financial crisis, and the heavy price paid for its pursuit of global ambitions.\u201d That price may not be fully paid, yet, as RBS is still co-operating with a separate investigation involving the Department of Justice. Over in Greece, the prospect that the debt-stricken country could return to the financial markets soon has dominated the news. Now, in exclusive comments to our correspondent, the Greek minister of state and government spokesman has confirmed that accessing markets remains a priority even if senior bank officials have described the move as premature. Helena Smith reports from Athens Hopes of Greece\u2019s imminent return to markets \u2013 the bellwether of economic recovery \u2013 appeared to be dashed last night when the country\u2019s central banker, Yiannis Stournaras, pronounced that he thought the move to be \u201ca bit early.\u201d But the absence of reaction by markets to Stournaras\u2019 comments has prompted speculation that a foray may be on the cards - sooner rather than later. Greece\u2019s current bailout programme expires in August 2018, and as Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told the Guardian, the aim is to be fully prepared to tap markets by that date. \u201cWe want to prepare the ground with test exits [until 2018] in order to be able at the end of the programme to finance our debt without official sector support,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven that, we are considering all possible scenarios regarding optimum timing for the first issuance.\u201d We\u2019ve also got fresh evidence that the European recovery is strengthening. Eurozone industrial production rose by 4% year-on-year in May, new figures from Eurostat show. Germany, France, Italy and Spain all reported strong figures, indicating that demand is picking up. Kathleen Brooks of City Index sees signs of hope for workers in today\u2019s data. She\u2019s encouraged by that weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, rose to 2% per year from 1.8%, and that the number of new jobs created also rose. Even with the pick-up in wage growth in May, the consumer remains constrained, as CPI is running at 2.9%, however, things could start to get easier for UK households as we will explain. Chart 1 below shows UK 3-month jobs growth and UK ex. Bonus wage data over five years. As you can see, there is no real link between UK job creation and wage data, with the two often moving in opposite directions. However, the recent uptick in wages has corresponded with an uptick in job creation, after the two moved in opposing directions, as you can see marked in the chart. Wages tend to lag job growth, however, as job growth continues to pick up from the lows reached in Q3 last year, perhaps now is the time for wages to rise..... The opposition Labour party says it would battle the wage freeze by raising the UK\u2019s minimum wage to \u00a310 per hour, from \u00a37.20 today. Debbie Abrahams MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, says: \u201cWe welcome the overall increase in employment, but are deeply concerned that millions have faced a real terms pay cut under this Government.\u201d \u201cThe cost of basic essentials continues to rise as real wages decline under the Conservatives. Millions are struggling to get by while Theresa May hands \u00a31 billion to the DUP to keep herself in a job.\u201d \u201cToo many people also continue to face barriers to getting a job on the basis of their age, ethnicity, disability or where they live. These same groups bear the brunt of this Government\u2019s failed austerity plans.\u201d \u201cA Labour government will implement a real Living Wage of \u00a310 per hour, and bring an immediate end to Tory austerity.\u201d Professor Costas Milas, of the Management School at Liverpool University, has interrogated the data, and reports: The Bank of England historical database, which reports unemployment rate data since 1856 is telling us that the unemployment rate has been below 4.5% 43%(!!!) of the times. Since 1856, real average wage growth has been 1.54% and during this period, it has been negative only 22% of the times. So in a historical context, we are currently doing very poorly in terms of real wage growth and reasonably (but not exceptionally) well in terms of the unemployment rate! As this graph shows, the number of people working in the UK has risen pretty steadily since the recession ended in 2009. Helen Barnard, head of analysis at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), is deeply concerned by the drop in real wages \u201cBritain\u2019s employment has climbed ever higher and it is encouraging to see more people in work. Yet the number of people struggling to make ends meet despite being in work has also increased. \u201cReal wages have seen an alarming slide. This is the third month in a row that real earnings have fallen. In real terms earnings are no better than they were 12 years ago: total pay in real terms is the same as it was in August 2005. \u201cWith benefits and tax credits frozen, there is little respite for families just about managing. Some 3.8 million workers are trapped in poverty, many with few qualifications and precious little opportunity to retrain. The minister for Employment, Damian Hinds, has welcomed today\u2019s labour market report. He point out that more people are in work than at any time since 1971, when records began. \u201cThese latest statistics are another reminder that our strong economy is giving record numbers of people the chance to find and stay in work. \u201cUnemployment is low, employment is high and there are over three quarters of a million vacancies. This is great news for Britain and for millions of ordinary working families. The real wage squeeze makes it hard for the Bank of England to raise interest rates soon, argues Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management. Policy makers at the Bank of England are faced with a puzzling shift in the relationship between unemployment and wages. Growth in core average earnings (excluding bonuses), did improve but only marginally, and was up just 2% compared with a year earlier. Inflation is now above the Bank\u2019s target level and real earnings growth has slipped into negative territory. This is having a negative impact on household spending. With uncertainty gathering over the Brexit negotiations, the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee would need to see a distinct improvement in earnings growth towards 3% and above, to be in a position to raise interest rates.\u201d John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, is encouraged that UK employment has hit a fresh record high. \u201cThe great UK jobs creating machine has kicked into gear again, with employment growth accelerating in recent months after slower growth in late 2016. The employment rate is now within touching distance of 75% for the first time ever, while the unemployment rate fell further to 4.5%. But Hawksworth also fears that real wages will not start rising again for some months. \u201cIn the 1970s or 1980s such low unemployment, combined with inflation rising towards 3%, could have set off a wage-price spiral. But the Phillips curve now appears remarkably flat, with regular pay growth still subdued at 2% despite some pick-up from last month. Including bonuses, average earnings growth actually fell back to 1.8%. \u201cAs a consequence, real earnings growth remains deep in negative territory and this seems unlikely to change anytime soon. This will dampen consumer spending power, though the continued strength of the jobs market should prevent the recent slowdown in the economy turning into a recession.\u201d A quick explanation: the Phillips Curve argues that there is an inverse relationship between joblessness and wage inflation. So if unemployment rises, pay will drop and vice versa. However in the UK, and many other advance economies, unemployment has fallen sharply but earnings have not pushed higher. Some economists suggest the Phillips Curve is flatter than expected. Others argue that something has fundamentally changed; perhaps the erosion of union power? Or increased use of robotics (artificial intelligence doesn\u2019t demand a pay rise)? Or perhaps weak productivity means bosses simply can\u2019t pay more?.... Geraint Johnes, Professor of Economics at Lancaster University and Research Director at the Work Foundation, says the drop in total pay is \u201ca source of concern.\u201d Including bonuses, the preferred three month average figure for the growth in average weekly earnings slipped down to 1.8% in May, compared with 2.1% in April. This figure is now 2% or lower in all sectors except for distribution and hospitality. The less reliable single month figure for the whole economy also now stands at 1.8%. Professor Johnes also points out that the number of vacancies has fallen slightly in the last couple of months (but remains high). There has been a sharp decline in vacancies in the real estate sector over the most recent quarter, possibly reflecting the slowdown in the housing market. This latest fall in real wages is likely to drag on Britain\u2019s economic growth this year, Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: Shrinking real pay doesn\u2019t bode well for economic growth \u2013 the UK economy is heavily reliant on the consumer and falling real incomes should eventually translate into lower retail sales. Respected think-tank NIESR said last week it expects relatively anaemic growth of 0.3% in the second quarter \u2013 barely higher than the disappointing 0.2% registered in Q1. Brettell also points out that the classic idea that workers get paid more when labour is in short supply seems to have broken down. The UK labour market is becoming increasingly difficult to interpret. Conventional economic theory suggests that low unemployment should ultimately lead to upward pressure on wages \u2013 but there has been scant evidence of this during the latest squeeze on household finances. Perhaps workers simply don\u2019t have the bargaining power they once did. Britain\u2019s economy needs higher wages to keep consumer spending up, and protect the economy from Brexit uncertainty. So argues Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First. Real wage gains are the silver bullet for the concerns that swamp the UK economy at the moment; they come from optimistic employers happy with business conditions (which we do not have), they allow consumers to re-balance spending figures from credit uptake (which we urgently need) and promote growth in generalised output with a central bank more comfortable to normalise monetary policy (which is an argument that desperately needs clarity but yet there is little to be found).\u201d Today\u2019s report also shows the regional differences in Britain\u2019s labour market. Employment levels are highest in the South West of England, and the lowest in Northern Ireland. ONS senior statistician Matt Hughes says the UK employment market looks \u201cstrong\u201d, apart from the drop in real wages. \u201cThe general picture is little changed on last month, with the overall employment rate and that for women both at record highs, the inactivity rate at a joint record low and the unemployment rate falling to its lowest since early summer 1975. Despite the strong jobs picture, however, there has been another real-terms fall in total earnings, with the growth in weekly wages low and inflation still rising.\u201d Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group has some interesting thoughts on today\u2019s unemployment report: This chart, from Jamie McGeever at Reuters, shows how rising inflation has driven real wages down: Bad news for workers; wages are still not keeping up with inflation. Today\u2019s report shows that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in nominal terms (that is, not adjusted for price inflation) increased by 1.8% including bonuses in the March-May quarter. Basic pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.0% year-on-year. Inflation jumped by 2.9% in May, so these figures confirm that earnings are falling in real terms. The number of people in work rose by 175,000 during the last quarter, taking the employment total above 32 million. The ONS says: There were 32.01 million people in work, 175,000 more than for December 2016 to February 2017 and 324,000 more than for a year earlier. The chart shows how Britain\u2019s jobless rate has now dropped to the lowest level since Harold Wilson\u2019s final term in Downing Street: Breaking: Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to 4.5% in the three months to May, a new 42-year low. That\u2019s down from 4.6% a month ago, and is the lowest rate since 1975. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the number of people out of work fell by 64,000 during the March-to-May quarter. That takes the total number of people out of work down to 1.495 million. The employment rate has hit a record high, at 75.9%..... More to follow! The drop in the pound is pushing shares in exporters higher in London. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 52 points to 7381, up 0.7% today. Fashion chain Burberry is the top riser, up 3.2%, after reporting a 3% jump in underlying retail revenue growth in the last quarter. Burberry credited better stronger sales in mainland China, and in the UK, for the pick-up in sales. Steve Clayton, fund manager of Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s Select UK Growth Shares fund, says it\u2019s an encouraging performance. The company say they are seeing \u201ctop customers returning\u201d. to their stores. In other words, the Chinese are spending again. We have bad news for any Brits heading over the channel this summer holidays. The pound has hit its lowest level against the euro since November 2016, following Ben Broadbent\u2019s dovish comments. Sterling has weakened to \u20ac1.1187, which means one euro is worth 89.4p. As this chart shows, the pound was worth \u20ac1.30 before last June\u2019s EU referendum. Lee Hardman, an analyst with MUFG in London, agrees that an August rate rise now looks less likely, which is why sterling has fallen. He says (via Reuters) \u201c[The pound] is definitely trading on a softer footing after this news. \u201cFor anyone who had any expectation of an August hike - that is clearly looking very unrealistic now, although he does reinforce that they are moving towards a hike. That will help keep alive expectations for a move later this year.\u201d The pound has fallen to a two-week low after Ben Broadbent revealed he isn\u2019t ready to vote for a rate hike. Sterling shed 0.2% to hit $1.2821, its lowest level since late June, as the prospects of a rate rise in August receded. Philip Shaw of Investec reckons the BoE is now certain to leave interest rates on hold at their current record low, at next month\u2019s meeting. There\u2019s early drama in the markets today, as Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent declares that he is not ready to vote to raise interest rates. Speaking to the Press and Journal in Aberdeen, Broadbent declared that there are too many \u201cimponderables\u201d about the state of the UK economy. And that makes it \u201cvery difficult\u201d for the monetary policy committee to judge if business confidence is strong enough to support higher borrowing costs. Here\u2019s a flavour of the report: Highlighting the \u201cmood of business\u201d as the key factor in his thinking, he said: \u201cIf you look at the past six to 12 months, economic growth has been okay and the employment rate good. Unemployment has drifted down a little \u2026 and inflation is higher. \u201cThere is reason to see the committee moving in that direction (higher interest rates) \u2013 but there are still a lot of imponderables.\u201d It\u2019s an important intervention. At least two Bank of England policymakers are likely to vote for a rate hike in August, so Broadbent is seen as one of the centrist voices who could swing the decision. As Broadbent puts it: \u201cIn my opinion, it is a bit tricky at the moment to make a decision (to raise rates). I am not ready to do it yet.\u201d It\u2019s quite a scoop for the P&amp;J. The City had expected Broadbent to declare his hand yesterday, when he gave a speech in Scotland\u2019s oil capital. Instead, he avoided monetary policy issues, sticking to trade issues - and warning that Britain would suffer badly if trade with the EU was materially affected by Brexit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze could worsen today when the latest unemployment statistics are released. City economists fear that wage growth slowed again in the last quarter, to just 1.8% in the three months to May. If they\u2019re right, that means real wages are shrinking at a faster pace (as inflation hit 2.9% in May), meaning many households will find it even harder to make ends meet. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada say: The real inflation story in the UK is not the recent pickup in headline CPI inflation, but the failure of earnings growth to follow. Today\u2019s labour market data will likely see headline earnings growth fall well below 2% y/y, leaving wage growth more than 1% point below CPI inflation. Economists also expect that the UK unemployment rate will remain at 4.6% \u2013 the lowest in over four decades, with an extra 120,000 people joining the labour force. That sounds like a strong labour market; but it simply isn\u2019t feeding through to pay packets. Overnight, ratings agency Moody\u2019s warned that Britain\u2019s economy will lose momentum this year amid squeezed living standards and uncertainty over Brexit. There could be excitement in Canada too. The Bank of Canada is widely expected to raise interest rates today, for the first time in seven years. And Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is testifying to the House Financial Services Committee, on the state of the US economy. She\u2019s likely to stick to her position that the US economy is recovering, having raised interest rates last month. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK unemployment data 10am BST: Eurozone industrial production for May 1.30pm BST: Janet Yellen\u2019s statement to the House Financial Services Committee 3pm BST: Bank of Canada interest rate decision 3pm BST: Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony begins",

The employment rate is now within touching distance of 75% for the first time ever, while the unemployment rate fell further to 4.5%.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Hawksworth also fears that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jul/12/pound-falls-broadbent-interest-rates-uk-unemployment-wage-squeeze-business-live?page=with:block-5965e067e4b0a11877b3938d#block-5965e067e4b0a11877b3938d\"> real wages</a> will not start rising again for some months.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIn the 1970s or 1980s such low unemployment, combined with inflation rising towards 3%, could have set off a wage-price spiral. But the Phillips curve now appears remarkably flat, with regular pay growth still subdued at 2% despite some pick-up from last month. Including bonuses, average earnings growth actually fell back to 1.8%.</p> <p>\u201cAs a consequence, real earnings growth remains deep in negative territory and this seems unlikely to change anytime soon. This will dampen consumer spending power, though the continued strength of the jobs market should prevent the recent slowdown in the economy turning into a recession.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>A quick explanation:</strong> the Phillips Curve argues that there is an inverse relationship between joblessness and wage inflation. So if unemployment rises, pay will drop and vice versa.</p> <p>However in the UK, and many other advance economies, unemployment has fallen sharply but earnings have not pushed higher. </p> <p>Some economists suggest the Phillips Curve is flatter than expected. Others argue that something has fundamentally changed; perhaps the erosion of union power? Or increased use of robotics (artificial intelligence doesn\u2019t demand a pay rise)? Or perhaps weak productivity means bosses simply can\u2019t pay more?....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IFM_Economist/status/884200532742504448\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Phillips curve is broken globally &amp; Australia is no different.

      "bodyText": "Irish business leaders have called for a \u20ac1bn state aid programme to guard against Brexit disruption, in the event that the UK quits the customs union. The Irish Business and Employers Confederation wants the EU to cushion Irish exporters caught up in the chaos this would cause, giving them the space to \u201cinnovate, diversify into new markets, train staff and invest for the future\u201d. Danny McCoy, chief executive of Ibec, said the money would protect trade between Ireland and the UK, which could become a more serious competitor on the foreign investment front as it would be free to offer state aid and other incentives once outside the EU. Ibec\u2019s call comes as experts working on the technical challenges of achieving a \u201cfrictionless border\u201d between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland say that a \u201cNissan-type\u201d state deal for cross-border agri-food businesses may be also be needed. At a briefing in Brussels, McCoy warned that the UK government was leading Britain towards an \u201ceconomically calamitous Brexit divorce\u201d. He said the UK\u2019s approach continued \u201cto put short-term political concerns ahead of jobs and the needs of business, without any regard for established trading relationships\u201d. \u201cIf the UK insists on such a policy of self-harm, a long transition period would be needed to allow companies time to adapt,\u201d he added. McCoy said Brexit\u2019s impact on Ireland should be treated like a \u201cforce majeure\u201d inflicted on Irish business. Northern Irish agriculture leaders have previously warned that farmers could go out of business if trade barriers that made them less competitive were imposed. \u201cIn the case of a fraught exit, funds amounting to up to \u20ac1bn over three years may be needed from domestic and EU sources to help Irish companies innovate, diversify into new markets, train staff and invest for the future,\u201d said McCoy. The Irish agri-food sector is concerned about the prospect of tariffs which, for beef and dairy, are among the highest imposed under World Trade Organisation rules. Ibec says they could be crippling for businesses that rely heavily on cross-border production and trade. About a third of milk from cows in Northern Ireland is transported across the border for production into butter, cheese and infant formula. Eoin Magennis, senior economist at Ulster University, has calculated that the cost of tariffs on cross-border production would amount to \u20ac250-\u20ac350m a year, based on 2015 trade figures. \u201cWe looked at the levels of cross-border trade right across the board and 70% of those tariffs would be payable on food,\u201d Magennis said. \u201cSo the question is do both Irish and British governments just take a hit and pay that tariff to protect those businesses? Maybe there\u2019s a Nissan-type deal to be done here on agri-food.\u201d He was referring to the unspecified investment pledges the Japanese car manufacturer got from Theresa May to stay in Sunderland following the EU referendum. However, such a deal would be controversial and possibly illegal under WTO rules and could prompt protests by Scottish and Welsh producers also exporting to the EU, said Michael Lux, a customs lawyer with 40 years experience including a stint at the European commission. \u201cThere would be some issues with compatibility with international law,\u201d said Lux. \u201cIf you say I\u2019d support your investments, under the subvention agreement of the WTO, that might be a problem and lead to accusations of unfair state subsidies.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Burberry drops plans to redevelop Leeds mill despite pick-up in sales", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Burberry has ditched a plan to revive the Temple Works mill in Leeds and delayed a decision on whether to build a new factory next door for at least another year despite a pick-up in sales. Sales at stores open more than a year rose by a better-than-expected 4% in the three months to 30 June as Chinese shoppers began to splash the cash again. City analysts had been expecting a 2% rise, in line with the previous quarter. Underlying sales rose by about 15% in mainland China as the chief operating and financial officer, Julie Brown, said \u201cChinese consumer confidence continued to build.\u201d She said there had also been a rise in Chinese shoppers heading to Hong Kong, after a long period of decline. The UK remained Burberry\u2019s fastest-growing market as international travellers continued to take advantage of the drop in the value of the pound since last year\u2019s Brexit vote to pick up a bargain. Brown said growth had slowed from the 30% to 40% seen last year as 2017\u2019s rise in tourist spending was being compared against the post-referendum leap from June 2016. But she said local spending remained high. Luxury leather goods and a new lightweight version of the classic trenchcoat, designed for tropical climates, led the growth. Burberry\u2019s backpacks were the best seller, overtaking the Banner bag. The strong Asian sales and ongoing UK growth helped offset declines in the Middle East, the US and in some continental European areas including Italy, where Brown said Burberry faced tough competition from local luxury labels. Despite the strong performance, Burberry said it had told Leeds city council it would not be taking up an option to redevelop the grade 1 listed Temple Mill, which was part of a \u00a350m project to bring its textile and raincoat manufacturing under one roof. Brown said the plan was on hold as Burberry was still considering a number of options for the future including refurbishing its existing factories in Castleford and Keighley, developing a site it owns beside Temple Mill or building on an alternative greenfield site. The redevelopment of Temple Mill itself was originally intended to follow on from the development of the factory. Brown said the company remained committed to Leeds, where it is in the process of moving about 300 head office roles from London. \u201cWe decided to take our time,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThere is no pressing urgency to put money down. We are assessing our options.\u201d She said the project would remain under review for \u201cthe next year or so\u201d. The arrival of new chief executive Marco Gobbetti last week could well lead to a change of plan from that laid down by Christopher Bailey, the Yorkshire-born former chief executive and creative director who has now become president of the business. Gobbetti is expected to address shareholders publicly for the first time on Thursday at Burberry\u2019s annual meeting where there is expected to be debate over hefty pay packages for Bailey and Brown. Burberry announced plans for a new Leeds factory in November 2015 and originally said it would be moving its 800 manufacturing staff there by 2018 with plans to add at least another 200 jobs. But a year ago, the company said it had \u201cpaused\u201d the project as it considered the impact of Brexit. On Wednesday, the company said it now employed about 1,100 people at its existing factories, which it was refurbishing. Brown said the latest delay was not related directly to Brexit but about \u201cunderstanding what our priorities are as a company\u201d.",

Sorry to disappoint, but it\u2019s not going to happen. In truth, it was never going to happen. The Old Lady has been showing a bit of leg, that\u2019s all. If there was any serious doubt about the outcome of the August meeting of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, the latest news from the labour market puts the issue to rest. Unemployment matters to the eight members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee because they are looking for evidence that a reduction in the jobless rate \u2013 a tightening of the labour market in the jargon of the trade \u2013 is leading to a pick-up in wage inflation. The idea is that falling unemployment changes the balance of power in the labour market. When the jobless total is high, employers are in control because people are desperate to find work or are worried about being made redundant. When the jobless total falls, workers can be more choosy about who they work for and employers have to pay more. The Bank\u2019s model of the economy assumes that wage inflation will take off if unemployment falls below a certain level. This equilibrium level of unemployment is precisely the same as the actual level of unemployment \u2013 4.5%. On the basis that a stitch in time saves nine, some members of the MPC think interest rates should go up now before wage inflation starts to spiral. For these inflation hawks, the latest labour market figures support their argument. Regular pay in the three months ending in May was 2% up on the same three months last year. That compared with annual earnings growth of 1.8% in the quarter ending April. But the case for a pre-emptive interest-rate strike will be countered by the MPC\u2019s doves. They will say that the Bank\u2019s estimate of the equilibrium level of unemployment has been steadily reduced in recent years as it has become clear that the economy can operate with much shorter dole queues without a pick-up in inflation. It is quite possible that the equilibrium level of unemployment is lower than 4.5%. What\u2019s more, even after the pick-up in regular pay, living standards are currently being squeezed hard. Prices are going up more quickly than wages and that is feeding through into weaker consumer spending. At some point, perhaps not too far away, it might lead to higher unemployment \u2013 and lower inflation \u2013 as well. At the last meeting of the MPC, five members voted to keep rates on hold. Of the three members who plumped for a rate rise, one, Kristin Forbes, has now left the committee.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK consumers are suffering a sustained fall in living standards as real pay fell again in the three months to May, piling more pressure on cash-strapped households. Regular pay adjusted to account for the impact of inflation fell by 0.5% year on year over the period, shrinking family incomes and signalling a weaker outlook for consumer spending. It followed a 0.6% drop in real pay in the three months to April, and a 0.4% fall in the previous three months, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. Real pay fell despite a surprise drop in the unemployment rate from 4.6% to 4.5%, which was the lowest since May to July 1975. The employment rate rose to 74.9%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said the government must intervene to address the pay squeeze. \u201cThree months of falling pay is three months too many. The clock is ticking while workers wait for the government to act,\u201d she said. \u201cMinisters must set out a plan to get real wages rising across the public and the private sectors. They should start by scrapping the unfair pay restrictions on nurses, midwives and other public sector workers. And the minimum wage must be raised to \u00a310 as quickly as possible.\u201d Damian Hinds, the employment minister, focused on the strong employment figures, describing them as \u201canother reminder that our strong economy is giving record numbers of people the chance to find and stay in work\u201d. The prolonged drop in real wages reflects the rising pressure on household budgets as prices rise at a faster rate than pay. The ONS said that before inflation, regular pay growth excluding bonuses picked up slightly to 2% year on year in the three months to May, from 1.8% in the three months to April. However, that was still well below inflation, which hit a four-year high of 2.9% in May. Inflation has risen rapidly since the Brexit vote last June triggered a sharp drop in the value of the pound. A weaker pound pushes up the price of goods imported from abroad, feeding through to higher shop prices. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said it was a striking point of the modern economy that wage growth was so weak despite low unemployment. \u201cIn the 1970s or 1980s such low unemployment, combined with inflation rising towards 3%, could have set off a wage-price spiral. \u201cReal earnings growth remains deep in negative territory and this seems unlikely to change any time soon. This will dampen consumer spending power, though the continued strength of the jobs market should prevent the recent slowdown in the economy turning into a recession.\u201d The ONS has calculated that adjusted for inflation, UK employees are now earning \u00a315 less a week after tax and deductions than they were in March 2008, six months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the global financial crisis. Ian Kernohan, an economist at Royal London Asset Management, said the Bank of England was unlikely to raise interest rates at next month\u2019s policy meeting given the weakness of pay growth. \u201cInflation is now above the Bank\u2019s [2%] target level and real earnings growth has slipped into negative territory,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is having a negative impact on household spending. With uncertainty gathering over the Brexit negotiations, the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee would need to see a distinct improvement in earnings growth towards 3% and above, to be in a position to raise interest rates.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tesco\u2019s proposed \u00a33.7bn deal to buy the cash-and-carry group Booker has been referred for an in-depth investigation after the competition watchdog said it could result in higher prices for shoppers in about 350 areas across the UK. The Competition and Markets Authority said in those areas Tesco overlapped with convenience chains including Londis and Budgens, which were supplied by Booker. \u201cThe CMA believes that in more than 350 local areas where there is currently an overlap between Tesco shops and Booker-supplied \u2018symbol\u2019 stores, shoppers could face worse terms when buying their groceries,\u201d the watchdog said, announcing the decision. \u201cThere are concerns that, after the merger, there is potential for Booker to reduce the wholesale services or terms it offers the \u2018symbol\u2019 stores it currently supplies, in order to drive customers to their local Tesco.\u201d Tesco operates more than 3,000 stores across the UK, while Booker supplies more than 5,000 stores under the Premier, Londis, Budgens and Family Shopper brands. The proposed deal would turn Britain\u2019s biggest retailer into a major supplier to small retailers, serving 125,000 independent convenience stores as well as 468,000 restaurants and pubs. The deal was revealed in January and considered to be Tesco\u2019s first major corporate move since it was led by Sir Terry Leahy, who quit in 2011. In recent years, the retailer has been hit by growing competitions from discount chains and an accounting scandal. Current boss Dave Lewis was parachuted in from Unilever to turn around the business, and under his leadership Tesco reported its first year of sales growth since 2010. The Booker case will be considered by an inquiry group chosen from the CMA\u2019s independent panel members, who will undertake further research and take evidence from parties potentially affected by the deal. The panel has 24 weeks to carry out the investigation, which means Tesco and Booker will have a final decision by Christmas, the CMA says. An interim report will be published with provisional findings. Last month Tesco and Booker requested a fast-track referral to the next stage of the CMA\u2019s investigation to try to speed up the deal. A spokesperson for Tesco said: \u201cWe are pleased the CMA has accepted our fast-track request, and we look forward to continuing our engagement over the coming months. \u201cThis merger has always been about growth, and we remain convinced that it will bring benefits for consumers, independent retailers, caterers, small businesses, suppliers and colleagues.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The controversial Shenhua Watermark coalmine in NSW will be scaled back to avoid mining land marked as \u201cstrategic\u201d agricultural lands, after a partial buy-back of the mining licence by the state government. The government indicated it was in discussions with Shenhua in August, when it announced a similar buyback of BHP\u2019s planned underground mine in nearby Caroona, also on the Liverpool plains. There has been continued speculation that the mine was not financially viable, given declining Chinese coal imports and Shenhua\u2019s failure to apply for a mining licence, instead extending its cheaper exploration licence. On Wednesday the NSW minister for resources, Don Harwin, said 51.4% of the company\u2019s exploration licence would be handed back under the agreement, with the government refunding about $262m from the original amount received from Shenhua. The Shenhua exploration licence was granted for about $300m in 2008 by the disgraced former NSW Labor resources minister Ian Macdonald. The open-cut mine was planned to cover 35 sq km in rich farming land in the state\u2019s north. \u201cWhile the previous Labor government granted the original exploration licence, this government has determined there should be no mining on the fertile black soils of the Liverpool plains,\u201d Harwin said. \u201cIn August 2016 the NSW government also secured an agreement to buy back the licence for BHP\u2019s Caroona project, another exploration licence issued by the previous Labor government on the Liverpool plains.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been betrayed by the NSW government,\u201d said a Breeza farmer, Andrew Pursehouse, whose property adjoins the proposed coalmine. \u201cIf it was serious about protecting farmland, it would have cancelled the coal licence outright and stopped this coalmine. \u201cCarving out areas that Shenhua weren\u2019t going to mine won\u2019t change a thing. Anything less than the full cancellation of the Watermark project will fail to protect the farming systems of the Liverpool Plains.\u201d The NSW Greens\u2019 resources spokesman, Jeremy Buckingham, said the buy-back did not go far enough and he called on the premier to cancel the project. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a recognition that building a giant coalmine in Australia\u2019s best agricultural area is a terrible idea, but anything less than full cancellation does not lift the threat,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who has visited the area knows how interconnected the ridges are to the plains. The idea that you can dig a 300-metre deep pit next to a flood plain and it will not impact on the water table is ridiculous. It is certainly not worth taking the risk. \u201cThere is no \u2018safe\u2019 size for the Shenhua coalmine. It is the wrong mine, in the wrong place, at the wrong time as we confront dangerous climate change.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy will lose momentum this year amid squeezed living standards and uncertainty over Brexit and the inconclusive election result, leading ratings agencies have predicted. Moody\u2019s said the qualms about talks in Brussels and the minority government have increased the UK\u2019s political and financial risks. Analysts at the ratings agency said the UK economy has started to slow and they expect it to weaken considerably throughout the rest of the year, adding that it was unclear if the government could deliver a \u201creasonably good\u201d Brexit deal. Moody\u2019s said the government appeared to be pursuing objectives pointing towards a hard exit and said growth prospects over the medium term could be \u201cmaterially weaker\u201d if the UK fails to sign a trade deal allowing access to the single market. Kathrin Muehlbronner, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s, said: \u201cThe likelihood of an abrupt \u2013 and damaging exit \u2013 with no agreement and reversion to [World Trade Organization] trading rules has increased compared to our expectation after the referendum, with the government so far pursuing objectives that imply a hard exit.\u201d Weaker public finances could lead to a \u201cfurther delay in reversing the rising tend of public debt\u201d, the agency warned in a report. However, it said the Bank of England\u2019s credibility should ensure financial stability, with exchange rate flexibility giving support for exports. Another ratings agency, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, also predicted a fall in the UK\u2019s growth rate \u2013 from 1.8% in 2016 to 1.4% in 2017 and 0.8% in 2018 \u2013 adding that the outlook might be even worse if the Brexit talks between Britain and the EU go badly. Despite speculation of an increase in interest rates from the Bank of England next month, S&amp;P said the weakness of the economy would result in borrowing costs being left on hold at 0.25% for another two years. S&amp;P\u2019s senior economist, Boris Glass, said: \u201cGiven demand weakness, the temporary nature of imported inflation, moderate domestic wage pressures, and Brexit uncertainties, we expect the Bank of England\u2019s current ultra-accommodative stance to continue over the medium term and expect a first rate hike to occur only in mid-2019.\u201d S&amp;P said the better-than-predicted performance of the economy in 2016 had been the result of \u201cextraordinarily robust consumer spending\u201d but added that the pressure on households from prices rising more rapidly than wages was likely to persist for the rest of 2017 and into 2018. Figures due out on Wednesday will show whether the lowest unemployment since the 1970s has started to have an upward effect on earnings, which are currently growing by just over 2% a year. Inflation as measured by the consumer prices index is running at 2.9%, while the retail prices index is 3.7%. The depreciation of the pound would make UK exports more competitive but would only add between 0.2 and 0.3 percentage points to growth from 2017 to 2020. S&amp;P said a study of the data showed that some UK exporters had taken advantage of the fall in sterling to raise their prices rather than to break into new markets. The agency said that while the price increases were to some extent a matter of choice, they were likely to have been necessary for firms that relied on imports which had become more expensive as a result of the falling exchange rate. With firms making Brexit contingency plans, investment was being shelved rather than given the go-ahead. \u201cOur forecasts for slower growth are subject to considerable downside risks, stemming mainly from Brexit uncertainties,\u201d Glass said. \u201cFor example, the staging of the negotiations, with the \u2018divorce\u2019 settlement being negotiated before any future relationship with the EU is addressed, means that should the separation negotiations stall, there would be less time left for negotiating the future trade relationship, risking a cliff edge. \u201cIn general, should negotiations stall for an extended period, this could translate into a further significant depreciation of sterling and a consequent rise in inflation.\u201d Ben Broadbent, one of the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governors, said a sharp drop in UK trade with the EU after Brexit would be bad for the economy. In a speech in Aberdeen that focused on the benefits of international trade, Broadbent said: \u201cPut simply, a significant curtailment of trade with Europe would force the UK to shift away from producing things it\u2019s been relatively good at, and therefore export to the EU, and towards the things it currently imports and is relatively less good at.\u201d A number of MPC members \u2013 including the governor, Mark Carney, and the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane \u2013 have given their views on the outlook for borrowing costs in recent months. Broadbent voted for official interest rates to remain on hold at the MPC\u2019s last meeting in June and his failure to mention monetary policy was seen by the City as a sign that he will vote the same way again in August. The pound fell slightly after Broadbent\u2019s speech and closed in London at $1.2850.",
