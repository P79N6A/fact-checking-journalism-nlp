      "bodyText": "The UK's economic recovery, set to be bolstered by strong third quarter growth figures, could lose some of its momentum as rising energy bills and low wage increases eat into consumer spending, according to a leading survey of household finances. A wage freeze in the public sector and a fall in job security across most sectors has helped keep the Markit household index for October at 41, well below the 50 mark that indicates households are optimistic about their finances. The downbeat mood of the survey is likely to contrast with official figures to be published on Friday that are expected to show the economy moved up a gear in the three months to the end of September. GDP growth could be as high as 1% for the quarter, which would appear to justify comments by the Bank of England's chief economist, Spencer Dale, that growth is running at an annualised rate of 3-4%. GDP grew by 0.7% in the three months to July. Many economists have warned, however, that the economy's reliance on consumer spending could mean it runs out of steam unless wages and disposable incomes begin to rise. Markit said the October survey indicated households expected their finances to deteriorate over the next 12 months, with only 26% of respondents expecting them to improve. Households said they were able to work more hours, showing that employers have increased output, but Markit's job security index fell, reflecting concerns among workers that the redundancy axe may still fall. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: \"The mood among UK households is less downbeat than has been the case for most of the past four and a half years. However, signs of an outright improvement in financial wellbeing are thin on the ground as incomes continue to lag behind living costs.\" The Markit survey also appeared to support Labour's claims that the recovery is bypassing many workers who remain squeezed by low wage rises and rising prices. Wages nudged 0.7% higher in the three months to the end of August while inflation was 2.8%, only falling to 2.7% in September. The survey also found \"a widening gap between the financial prospects between the highest and lowest income groups\". Markit said households in the top fifth income bracket recorded the most positive reading since the series began in 2009 at 60.6, in contrast to 33.6 for the lowest 20% of households. Lloyds Bank said its consumer sentiment survey reached an all time high in September, supported by optimism that the housing market had returned to health. But consumers were less certain about the future, the bank said, and were especially concerned about the impact of energy bill rises on their disposable incomes. \"A softer improvement in confidence about the future situation appears consistent with areas of pressure on consumer budgets against a backdrop of static wage growth,\" Llloyds said. \"Although gas and electricity spending growth has eased a little in September to around 8% on a year ago, gas and electricity prices remain a source of concern for overall price inflation for 77% of respondents.\" Npower is expected to become the latest energy firm to announce winter price hikes this week. The accountancy firm Deloitte also warned that a robust response from households in recent months was vulnerable to a slowdown in growth. Chief economist Ian Stewart said: \"Rising consumer confidence seems to reflect optimism about the economy, a stronger jobs market and a better outlook for housing. The central problem for UK consumers remains, as it has for the last three years, declining spending power. \"After taking out inflation and tax changes, earnings have fallen by about 1.5% in the last year. This actually represents an improvement compared [with] the fierce income squeeze of 2010 and 2011, but it leaves consumer spending power on a declining path. The key to a sustainable recovery in consumer activity is falling inflation and a pickup in earnings.\"",

      "bodyText": "America's largest bank, JP Morgan, is close to finalising a $13bn (\u00a38bn) record settlement with the US authorities over a number of issues related to the subprime mortgage crisis. The settlement, described as tentative in some reports, is even greater than the $11bn that had been expected and is said not to release the bank from any criminal liability. It would also be the largest ever between the US government and a single company. The bank's chairman and chief executive Jamie Dimon had been involved personally in the discussions with the US Department of Justice and this month JP Morgan admitted it had incurred legal expenses of $9.2bn from regulatory investigations and lawsuits. In total the bank has put aside $23bn for potential litigation since 2010 \u2013 and has warned this could rise by a further $6.8bn \u2013 in moves that illustrate the stunning reversal in fortunes of a bank that had survived the banking crisis relatively unscathed. JP Morgan now faces more than a dozen investigations globally \u2013 from alleged bribery in China to a possible role in manipulating benchmark interest rates set in London known as Libor. Dimon had steered the bank through the financial crisis without ever reporting a quarterly loss, but that record ended this month when he had to admit that legal expenses drove the firm to a loss of $400m. The latest settlement relating to mortgage-backed securities follows a fine of more than $900m from a number of authorities over last year's London Whale trading incident, which Dimon had originally attempted to brush aside as \"tempest in a teapot\". The Whale episode also lost the bank $6.2bn and Dimon's bonus was halved as a consequence. At issue in the latest settlement is whether the bank sold mortgages that it knew were riskier than they appeared. Investors, including government-owned mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said that the bank told them loans were safer than they were, or that the bank was negligent in not verifying information from borrowers relating to their income and their ability to repay the debt. A sizeable chunk of the $13bn relates to customer redress. According to Bloomberg the settlement includes $4bn to the Federal Housing Finance Agency \u2013 which incorporates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Dimon secured the tentative deal in a meeting with the justice department's attorney general, Eric Holder, according to CNBC. Steve Cutler, the bank's general counsel, and Tony West, Holder's deputy, were said to be involved. Dimon and Holder had met face-to-face in Washington last month.

The settlement is partly the result of JP Morgan saving two firms \u2013 Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual \u2013 which account for about 80% of the securities involved in the $13bn fine. The US government encouraged JP Morgan to rescue both institutions as they were collapsing during the financial crisis. This month the bank said Dimon was no longer chairman of JP Morgan's main US retail banking subsidiary. JP Morgan did not comment, and the US department of justice could not be reached. Ongoing tempest For all his smooth talking, it is likely that the most memorable line to emerge from the career of JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon will be his crack about a \"tempest in a teapot\". That was his attempt to dismiss reports of problems in the bank's London office, where it turned out that his traders had lost $6bn.

      "bodyText": "We choose to go to the moon. So said John F Kennedy in September 1962 as he pledged a manned lunar landing by the end of the decade. The US president knew that his country's space programme would be expensive. He knew it would have its critics, but he took the long-term view. Warming to his theme in Houston that day, JFK went on: \"We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organise and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others too.\" That was the world's richest country at the apogee of its power in an age where both Democrats and Republicans were prepared to invest in the future. Kennedy's predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower, took a plan for a system of interstate highways and made sure it happened. Contrast that with today's America, which looks less like the leader of the free world than a banana republic with a reserve currency. Planning for the long term now involves last-ditch deals on Capitol Hill to ensure the federal government can remain open until January and debts can be paid at least until February. The US is not the only country with advanced short-termism. It merely provides the most egregious example of the disease. This is a world of fast food and short attention spans, of politicians so dominated by a 24/7 news agenda that they have lost the habit of planning for the long term. Britain provides another example of the trend. Governments of both left and right have for years put energy policy in the \"too hard to think about box\". They have not been able to make up their minds whether to commit to renewables as Germany has done, or to nuclear as France has done. So, the nation of Rutherford is now prepared to have a totalitarian country take a majority stake in a new generation of nuclear power stations. Politics, technology and human nature all militate in favour of kicking the can down the road. The most severe financial and economic crisis in more than half a century has further discouraged policymakers from raising their eyes from the present to the distant horizon. Clearly, though, the world faces long-term challenges that will only become more acute through prevarication. These include coping with a bigger and ageing global population, ensuring growth is sustainable and equitable, providing resources to pay for modern transport and energy infrastructure, and reshaping international institutions so they represent the world as it is in the early 21st century rather than as it was in 1945. Pascal Lamy had a stab at tackling some of these difficult issues last week when he presented the findings of the Oxford Martin Commission for Future Generations, which the former World Trade Organisation chief has been chairing for the past year. The commission's report, Now for the Long Term, looks at some \"mega trends\" that will shape the world in the decades to come, and lists the challenges under five headings: society, resources, health, geopolitics, governance. Change will be difficult, the study suggests, because problems are complex, institutions are inadequate, faith in politicians is low and short-termism is well-entrenched. It cites examples of collective success, such as the Montreal convention to prevent ozone depletion, the establishment of the Millennium Development Goals, and the G20 action to prevent the great recession of 2008-09 turning into a full-blown global slump. It also cites examples of collective failure \u2013 fish stocks depletion, the deadlocked Copenhagen climate change summit of 2009. The report suggests a range of long-term ideas worthy of serious consideration. It urges a coalition between the G20, 30 companies and 40 cities to lead the fight against climate change. It would like \"sunset clauses\" for all publicly funded international institutions to ensure they are fit for purpose; removal of perverse subsidies on hydrocarbons and agriculture with the money redirected to the poor; introduction of CyberEx, an early warning platform aimed at preventing cyber attacks; a Worldstat statistical agency to collect and ensure quality of data; and investment in the younger generation through conditional cash transfers and job guarantees. Lamy expressed concern that the ability to address challenges was being undermined by the absence of a collective vision for society. The purpose of the report, he said, was to build \"a chain from knowledge to awareness to mobilising political energy to action\". Full marks for trying, but this is easier said than done. Take trade, where Lamy has spent the past decade, first as Europe's trade commissioner then as head of the WTO, trying to piece together a new multilateral deal. This is an area in which all 150-plus WTO members agree in principle about the need for greater liberalisation but in which it has proved impossible to reach agreement in talks that started in 2001. Nor will a shakeup of the international institutions be plain sailing. It is a given that developing countries, especially the bigger ones such as China, India and Brazil, should have a bigger say in the way the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are run. Yet it's proved hard to persuade developed world countries to cede some of their voting rights, and the deal is still being held up by US foot dragging. These, remember, are the low-hanging fruit. Another conclave of the global great and good is looking at what should be done in the much trickier area of climate change. The premise of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate is that nothing will be done unless finance ministers are convinced of the need for action, especially given the damage caused by a deep recession and sluggish recovery. Instead of preaching to the choir the plan is to show how to achieve key economic objectives \u2013 growth, investment, secure public finances, fairer distribution of income \u2013 while at the same time protecting the planet. The pitch to finance ministers will be that tackling climate change will require plenty of upfront investment that will boost growth rather than harm it. Will this approach work? Well, maybe. But it will require business to see the long-term benefits of greening the economy as well as the short-term costs, because that would lead to the burst of technological innovation needed to accelerate progress. And it will require the same sort of commitment it took to win a world war or put a man on the moon.",
