      "bodyText": "British Airways could face a bill of at least \u00a3100m in compensation, additional customer care and lost business resulting from an IT meltdown that affected more than 1,000 flights over the weekend. All the airline\u2019s flights from Heathrow and Gatwick were grounded on Saturday. Services resumed on Sunday but cancellations and delays delays persisted with about 200 BA flights in and out of Heathrow cancelled on Sunday, according to Guardian calculations. There were no cancellations at Gatwick but some passengers experienced delays. The glitch is believed to have been caused by a power supply issue and there is no evidence of a cyber-attack, the airline said. In a video posted on YouTube, Alex Cruz, chief executive of BA, said that all the IT systems were not yet restored. \u201cMany of our IT systems are back up today. All my British Airways colleagues on the ground and in the air are pulling out all the stops to get our operation back up to normal as quickly as we possibly can, we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d \u201cI know this has been a horrible time for customers. Some have missed holidays, some have been stranded on aircraft, some separated from bags and some stuck in long queues while they have waited for information. On behalf of everyone at BA I want to apologise for the fact you\u2019ve had to go through these very trying experiences,\u201d said Cruz. As hundreds of passengers remained stranded, the GMB union blamed job cuts at BA for the IT problems which were thought to relate to a power outage. Mick Rix, GMB national officer for aviation, said:\u201cThis could have all been avoided. BA in 2016 made hundreds of dedicated and loyal IT staff redundant and outsourced the work to India. BA have made substantial profits in for a number of years, and many viewed the company\u2019s actions as just plain greedy.\u201d Both Gatwick and Heathrow advised passengers to check the status of their flights after terminals became congested with travellers hoping to get away for the long weekend and half-term school holiday. BA was asking passengers not to turn up until 90 minutes before their flights because of the level of congestion at Heathrow. On Sunday morning, Welsh international table tennis player Chloe Thomas, whose 7.30am flight from Heathrow to Germany for the World Table Tennis Championship in D\u00fcsseldorf was cancelled at the last minute, described chaotic scenes. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos, people are running about all over the place trying to rebook,\u201d she told Press Association. \u201cThere\u2019s no one to help, no leadership. There are lots of people everywhere. There\u2019s nowhere to sit, so people are just lying on the floor, sleeping on yoga mats.\u201d She said airport staff had handed out mats, as well as thin blankets, for people who were stuck there overnight. She added that one of the shops had sold out of food. Passengers faced long lines to check in, rebook or find lost luggage. James Walker, chief executive of free flights compensation claim site Resolver, said BA handled about 120,000 passengers a day in and out of Heathrow and Gatwick alone, indicating a bill of close to \u00a350m for delays of more than three hours under EU-backed compensation rules. About half of those passengers were likely to be entitled to meals and accommodation while waiting for delayed flights and a number will have sought a refund or decided to avoid using BA as a result of a \u201closs of trust\u201d. BA has also pledged to reunite hundreds of thousands of items of luggage caught up in the delays with passengers via a free courier service adding further to costs. Walker said there was no question that BA would have to pay out compensation under the EU scheme which demands payments for flights delayed by at least three hours as a result of reasons within the airline\u2019s control. \u201cThis is not like an ash cloud or traffic controllers\u2019 strike that can\u2019t be predicted. The computer system breaking down is within its control. BA is going to have to pay out and it looks like its costs will be north of \u00a3100m.\u201d Last year, the US airline Delta said it lost $100m after the shutdown of power to its data centre because an equipment failure led to delays. John Strickland, director of independent transport consultancy JLS Consulting, said it was likely that BA would face a \u201csignificant financial impact\u201d as its problems looked set to continue into this week. BA indicated it was expecting continued disruption as its website said customers due to fly on Monday and Tuesday could rebook for dates up to November this year, even if their flights were operating. Problems remain with the airline\u2019s IT systems, including its customer call centres and website as well as operations planning. It also takes time for BA to ensure planes and staff are in the right place. Crew working patterns are also governed by strict regulations on rest and working hours. \u201cIt\u2019s the magnitude and scale of the problem. Even if BA\u2019s IT systems were fully operational now it will take some days to fully restore a normal flying programme.\u201d Strickland said Heathrow was worst affected because it is the biggest BA hub and handles more long haul flights. BA was unable to respond to queries about the financial impact or the number of flights cancelled on Sunday but a spokesman said: \u201cWe would never compromise the integrity and security of our IT systems.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Edinburgh Woollen Mill has confirmed the acquisition of the Jaeger brand as part of plans to launch a new 50-store department chain. Philip Day, the billionaire owner of the Edinburgh Woollen Mill group, wants to open at least 50 of his eponymous Days stores, the first of which opened in Carmarthen, Wales, late last week. The first Days store was opened in a former BHS and will house all the Edinburgh Woollen Mill group brands, which now include Austin Reed, Peacocks, Jane Norman and Country Casuals as well as Jaeger. Others branches are expected to open shortly, in Newcastle and Bedford. The expansion comes despite the collapse of BHS, which has fuelled fears about the future of department stores in the age of online shopping. Day told the Sunday Times he expects to pick up more struggling brands this year as business rates and the fall in the value of sterling have a major impact on the high street. \u201cSometimes, lots of things all come at the same time, and I think 2017 is going to be one of those years,\u201d he said. In a statement issued on Sunday, Edinburgh Woollen Millen confirmed the collapsed Jaeger brand was now part of the group, the sale of which has proved controversial. Private equity firm Better Capital put the business up for sale after struggling for several years to revive Jaeger. In the brand\u2019s heyday, its clothes were worn by Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe but recently it has struggled to turn a profit amid heavy competition. Day is understood to have bought the retailer\u2019s debt and brand name in March but not the main company, meaning that the future of most of Jaeger\u2019s 700 employees and payments for suppliers remains unclear. Administrators have closed at least 20 of its 46 stores, making more than 200 staff redundant, and they remain in charge of the core business and its remaining staff. A group of suppliers owed millions of pounds is considering taking legal action against its former owners. The companies, which include the Portuguese clothing supplier Calvelex, tried to mount a rescue bid after Jaeger entered administration last month but found they could not buy the business because the rights to use the name had been sold. Asked about the threat of legal action, Jon Moulton, the boss of Jaeger\u2019s former owner Better Capital, said at the time the private equity firm had gone to great lengths to find a buyer for Jaeger without putting it into insolvency. \u201cAny insolvency actions lie with the [Better Capital] fund\u2019s successor,\u201d he said. Day, who took a \u00a330.5m dividend from the Edinburgh Woollen Mill group in the financial year to February 2016 when the group made a pre-tax profit of about \u00a390m on sales of \u00a3576m, has moved from his castle home in Cumbria to live in Dubai. He told the Sunday Times he spends fewer than 10 days a year in the UK.",

    "webTitle": "UK's biggest solar company takes shine to global projects with deals worth \u00a33bn", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest solar power company has shrugged off the cloud of drastic UK subsidy cuts by reinventing itself as an international firm with more than \u00a33bn of projects planned. More than 12,000 solar jobs were lost in the industry after the government slashed support in 2015, but Solarcentury has survived by turning outward to target markets in Latin America and Europe. The firm, founded by former oil geologist Jeremy Leggett in 1998, generated 85% of its \u00a3168m revenues in the UK during 2015-16. This financial year it expects to flip to 85% of revenues coming from international markets. \u201cWe\u2019d been successful in the UK, benefiting from the support scheme, and then in May 2015 the Tories came to power and completely changed direction: they wanted a nuclear power plant [Hinkley Point C], and frustrated renewables,\u201d said Frans van den Heuvel, the company\u2019s chief executive. The expertise the company built in the UK, where it fitted panels on 90,000 homes, has proved crucial in winning contracts abroad, he said. Solarcentury recently reached a major deal with Panama-based private equity investor ECOSolar, which takes its international pipeline of solar projects to 3,400MW, equivalent of three conventional power stations. The planned utility-scale projects, built at scale in fields rather than on rooftops, are worth about \u00a33bn. Economic growth and sunny climes in Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Argentina and Panama are the big drivers behind the growth. \u201cMexico is a huge market that is still growing despite all the threats from the new president in the US. They need more power. It was a monopoly and it\u2019s now privatised and more competitive,\u201d said van den Heuvel. In Columbia, Solarcentury said the new president and the peace deal with rebel group Farc had led to stability returning to a country where oil was still transported by plane to produce power in remote places \u2013 an expensive option that increasingly cheap solar could undercut. Favourable government policies, spurred by the historic Paris climate accord, have helped, too. \u201cDefinitely the Paris deal is a big driver. Without the Paris deal, it would still happen because of economics but now it will be even faster,\u201d said van den Heuvel. But the transition, from a company putting solar in British fields and on British homes and businesses, to one competing across the world against a host of rivals has not been easy. \u201cIt\u2019s very painful,\u201d the chief executive said of the reorganisation. \u201cBut you have to do that, because the market is changing.\u201d Van den Heuvel is no stranger to transformation, having moved operations for the Dutch solar company he founded in 1999 from the Netherlands to Germany after the Dutch government cut support schemes. Scheuten Solar was later bought by a Chinese firm. \u201cI would say, with a smile, the Dutch government stimulated export \u2013 and that\u2019s what the UK is doing now,\u201d he said. Solarcentury sees the UK market today as \u201cquite poor\u201d but believes solar is becoming so cheap that it will not need subsidising. One area of promise is the emerging market for battery and solar installations, which maximise the financial benefits from generating electricity from the sun.

This financial year it expects to flip to 85% of revenues coming from international markets.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d been successful in the UK, benefiting from the support scheme, and then in May 2015 the Tories came to power and completely changed direction: they wanted a nuclear power plant [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/21/hinkley-point-c-edf-somerset-nuclear-unions-brexit\">Hinkley Point C</a>], and frustrated renewables,\u201d said Frans van den Heuvel, the company\u2019s chief executive.</p> <p>The expertise the company built in the UK, where it fitted panels on 90,000 homes, has proved crucial in winning contracts abroad, he said.</p> <p>Solarcentury recently reached a major deal with Panama-based private equity investor ECOSolar, which takes its international pipeline of solar projects to 3,400MW, equivalent of three conventional power stations. The planned utility-scale projects, built at scale in fields rather than on rooftops, are worth about \u00a33bn.</p> <p>Economic growth and sunny climes in Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Argentina and Panama are the big drivers behind the growth. \u201cMexico is a huge market that is still growing despite all the threats from the new president in the US. They need more power. It was a monopoly and it\u2019s now privatised and more competitive,\u201d said van den Heuvel. </p> <p>In Columbia, Solarcentury said the new president and the peace deal with rebel group Farc had led to stability returning to a country where oil was still transported by plane to produce power in remote places \u2013 an expensive option that increasingly cheap solar could undercut.</p> <p>Favourable government policies, spurred by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/04/paris-climate-change-agreement-enters-into-force\">the historic Paris climate accord</a>, have helped, too. \u201cDefinitely the Paris deal is a big driver. Without the Paris deal, it would still happen because of economics but now it will be even faster,\u201d said van den Heuvel.</p> <p>But the transition, from a company putting solar in British fields and on British homes and businesses, to one competing across the world against a host of rivals has not been easy. \u201cIt\u2019s very painful,\u201d the chief executive said of the reorganisation. \u201cBut you have to do that, because the market is changing.\u201d</p> <p>Van den Heuvel is no stranger to transformation, having moved operations for the Dutch solar company he founded in 1999 from the Netherlands to Germany after the Dutch government cut support schemes. Scheuten Solar was later bought by a Chinese firm. \u201cI would say, with a smile, the Dutch government stimulated export \u2013 and that\u2019s what the UK is doing now,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Solarcentury sees the UK market today as \u201cquite poor\u201d but believes solar is becoming so cheap that it will not need subsidising. </p> <p>One area of promise is the emerging market for battery and solar installations, which maximise the financial benefits from generating electricity from the sun. The company has a dedicated team working on batteries and is working with an undisclosed retailer on one major storage project.</p> <p>Van den Heuvel does not have high hopes for a change of mindset on solar by the Conservatives after the election. But he is certain growth in solar, which has stalled at about 11GW of capacity since <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/17/uk-solar-panel-subsidies-slashed-paris-climate-change\">the subsidy cuts</a>, will return to the UK. \u201cIt will come back.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "Had Theresa May come back from her Easter walking holiday and decided against holding a general election, few would have blamed her. Going to the country on 8 June was always a gamble, as has become evident the longer the campaign has gone on. Consider the reasons for caution. It is mid-term when governments tend to be unpopular. The public is sick of politics after the 2014 Scottish referendum, the 2015 general election and last year\u2019s EU referendum. May had a workable majority and had vowed to go the distance. What\u2019s more, there were solid economic reasons to let things be. The recovery from the deep slump of 2008-09 has been the weakest in living memory. There has been no productivity growth and wages are lower than 10 years ago. The 1970s was thought of as the most dismal decade for the economy since the second world war but the 2010s now hold this unwanted accolade. In terms of what\u2019s happened to living standards, it isn\u2019t even close. Confronted with the strong evidence that economic policy since 2010 has been a failure, May\u2019s response has been to offer more of the same. Deep welfare spending cuts are designed to balance the books, and would help do so if the Bank of England was in a position to respond with cheaper borrowing. But that can\u2019t happen because interest rates are at 0.25% and can\u2019t go lower. As a result, welfare cuts suck spending power out of the economy. That leads to slower growth, which explains why it will now take until the middle of the next decade under Conservative plans to run a budget surplus. Presumably, sticking to a deficit-reduction plan that isn\u2019t working fits with May\u2019s \u201cstrong and stable\u201d mantra. But, in truth, the wrong mix of monetary and fiscal policy has left the economy weak and unstable. Weak because investment and productivity have been so poor. Unstable because growth has been so heavily reliant on debt-driven consumer spending. The \u201cstrong and stable\u201d May has performed two U-turns in the past three months: on the budget plans to increase national insurance contributions for the self-employed and on the manifesto\u2019s proposed dementia tax. A third U-turn \u2013 relaxing fiscal policy (cutting taxes or raising spending) so that monetary policy (interest rates) can be tightened would make a lot of sense and is long overdue. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out last week, government resistance to changing its macro-economic approach will inevitably lead to increased financial pressure on the NHS. Although health has been exempt from the deep cuts that have affected most other Whitehall departments since 2010, the settlements have been nugatory by historical standards. Real spending has risen on average by 4% a year since the mid-1950s. In the 18 years of Conservative rule between 1979 and 1997, it increased by 3% a year. On current plans it will increase by 1.4% a year between 2010 and 2022. (Labour\u2019s plans are, incidentally, not a lot more generous. They would involve annual increases of 2% a year). When the consultancy firm Oxford Economics put the economic plans of the three main parties through its model it concluded that the continuation of austerity under the Conservatives would lead to stable although unspectacular growth averaging 1.9% a year over the course of the next parliament. By contrast, the consultancy noted that \u201cthe more expansionary policies proposed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats would offer better outcomes in terms of GDP growth and allow monetary policy to be normalised sooner, without putting the public finances under strain.\u201d More specifically, the economy would be 1.9% bigger under the Lib Dem plans and 1% bigger under Labour\u2019s plans than under the Conservative plans. Higher growth under Labour and the Lib Dems would be the result of abolishing the 1% cap on public sector pay, an increase in public sector employment and plans to boost spending on public infrastructure by 50%. The claim by the Conservatives that higher borrowing would lead to much higher deficits and an explosion in the national debt is dismissed by Oxford Economics as the pre-Keynesian nonsense it is. \u201cOur scenarios demonstrate that higher levels of capital and current spending could be accommodated without putting the public finances under undue strain. Therefore, in our view it is very difficult to argue that the macroeconomic benefits offered by the more austere Conservative plans are anywhere near large enough to offset the opportunity of stronger growth offered by the plans of the Liberal Democrats or Labour.\u201d To sum up, May called an election when there was no need for one, when the public didn\u2019t want one, when living standards were falling, when the economy is dysfunctional, when the strategy of the past seven years has demonstrably failed, and when there is a viable alternative. Despite all that, there were reasons for May to take the bold approach. One was the experience of Gordon Brown, who would almost certainly have won an election in the autumn of 2007, when the financial crisis was in its infancy. A second was that many voters remain doubtful about the idea of higher borrowing even when it pays for itself. A third was that no matter how tough life is and no matter how tough it might get, the May calculus was that the public would assume it would be even tougher under Labour. She saw the opportunity of a presidential election in which she would be a handbag-wielding, Brussels-vanquishing Margaret Thatcher figure up against Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Michael Foot. The idea was to keep the focus on the need to have a \u201cstrong\u201d prime minister to deliver Brexit and \u2013 as far as possible \u2013 divert attention from the government\u2019s less than impressive economic record. When the economy did move centre stage, the plan was to brand Labour as the party of reckless borrowing and ideologically-driven nationalisation. In the first couple of weeks of the campaign, the May strategy was a storming success. The Conservatives were streets ahead in the opinion polls. There was talk of a landslide that would see the Tories beat Labour in Wales. But as the weeks have gone by, Labour has done better. Corbyn is better on the stump than May. The prime minister\u2019s rapid U-turn has raised doubts about whether she will be Mrs T redux in the Brexit negotiations. Finally, austerity fatigue and a leftward shift in public opinion on issues such as inequality and nationalisation, meant Labour won the battle of the manifestos. There are still 10 days until the election, a long time in politics. The polls suggest May will still win and she could still get her landslide. But if the majority is 50 rather than the 150 seen as possible earlier in the campaign, it will be a pyrrhic victory.",

Real spending has risen on average by 4% a year since the mid-1950s. In the 18 years of Conservative rule between 1979 and 1997, it increased by 3% a year. On current plans it will increase by 1.4% a year between 2010 and 2022. (Labour\u2019s plans are, incidentally, not a lot more generous. They would involve annual increases of 2% a year).<br></p> <p>When the consultancy firm Oxford Economics put the economic plans of the three main parties through its model it concluded that the continuation of austerity under the Conservatives would lead to stable although unspectacular growth averaging 1.9% a year over the course of the next parliament.</p> <p>By contrast, the consultancy noted that \u201cthe more expansionary policies proposed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats would offer better outcomes in terms of GDP growth and allow monetary policy to be normalised sooner, without putting the public finances under strain.\u201d More specifically, the economy would be 1.9% bigger under the Lib Dem plans and 1% bigger under Labour\u2019s plans than under the Conservative plans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/07/falling-real-pay-shows-the-british-economy-is-still-struggling\">Falling real pay shows the British economy is still struggling | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Higher growth under Labour and the Lib Dems would be the result of abolishing the 1% cap on public sector pay, an increase in public sector employment and plans to boost spending on public infrastructure by 50%. The claim by the Conservatives that higher borrowing would lead to much higher deficits and an explosion in the national debt is dismissed by Oxford Economics as the pre-Keynesian nonsense it is.</p> <p>\u201cOur scenarios demonstrate that higher levels of capital and current spending could be accommodated without putting the public finances under undue strain. Therefore, in our view it is very difficult to argue that the macroeconomic benefits offered by the more austere Conservative plans are anywhere near large enough to offset the opportunity of stronger growth offered by the plans of the Liberal Democrats or Labour.\u201d</p> <p>To sum up, May called an election when there was no need for one, when the public didn\u2019t want one, when living standards were falling, when the economy is dysfunctional, when the strategy of the past seven years has demonstrably failed, and when there is a viable alternative.</p> <p>Despite all that, there were reasons for May to take the bold approach. One was the experience of Gordon Brown, who would almost certainly have won an election in the autumn of 2007, when the financial crisis was in its infancy. A second was that many voters remain doubtful about the idea of higher borrowing even when it pays for itself. A third was that no matter how tough life is and no matter how tough it might get, the May calculus was that the public would assume it would be even tougher under Labour. She saw the opportunity of a presidential election in which she would be a handbag-wielding, Brussels-vanquishing Margaret Thatcher figure up against Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Michael Foot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/27/corbyn-cuts-mays-lead-voter-approval-ratings\">Tory nerves fray as Jeremy Corbyn narrows Theresa May\u2019s lead in new poll</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The idea was to keep the focus on the need to have a \u201cstrong\u201d prime minister to deliver Brexit and \u2013 as far as possible \u2013 divert attention from the government\u2019s less than impressive economic record. When the economy did move centre stage, the plan was to brand Labour as the party of reckless borrowing and ideologically-driven nationalisation.</p> <p>In the first couple of weeks of the campaign, the May strategy was a storming success. The Conservatives were streets ahead in the opinion polls. There was talk of a landslide that would see the Tories beat Labour in Wales.</p> <p>But as the weeks have gone by, Labour has done better. Corbyn is better on the stump than May. The prime minister\u2019s rapid U-turn has raised doubts about whether she will be Mrs T redux in the Brexit negotiations. Finally, austerity fatigue and a leftward shift in public opinion on issues such as inequality and nationalisation, meant Labour won the battle of the manifestos.</p> <p>There are still 10 days until the election, a long time in politics. The polls suggest May will still win and she could still get her landslide. But if the majority is 50 rather than the 150 seen as possible earlier in the campaign, it will be a pyrrhic victory. </p>",

      "bodyText": "A little over a century since Ford\u2019s Model T first allowed the average American to drive their own motor car, the manufacturing giant is threatening to take them away from the wheel. Or at least the appointment of a new chief executive, drawn from its autonomous cars division rather than the motor manufacturing mainstream, might suggest. Those reading the runes from Detroit see the elevation of Jim Hackett, an industry outsider who runs the smart mobility unit at Ford, as another significant step forward into a future where driverless cars become the norm. How imminent that future is remains up for debate. Certainly, there is great confidence among the manufacturers that the technological capability is around the corner \u2013 and they have ploughed in billions in investment. Ford itself should not be seen as emblematic of the 20th-century petrol past: it has, less noisily than some, set up its own billion-dollar labs and artificial intelligence projects. But perception can count for a lot with investors: Ford\u2019s stock market valuation has dipped and \u2013 despite their huge disparity in global sales \u2013 the car giant has recently suffered the indignity of being overtaken by upstart Tesla in terms of stock-market value. Hackett, regarded as a \u201cfuturist\u201d, is the kind of leader that the current Ford chairman \u2013 four generations down the line from the original Henry \u2013 sees as vital to the next step, bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and Detroit at a time when the experiments of the tech giants are threatening their future. The opportunities for Ford in an autonomous future are legion, but remain deeply uncertain. A wholesale revolution in transport could see a world clamouring for new, repurposed vehicles. But the concept of ownership is also likely to change: autonomy and connection could mean fewer cars needed, and fewer traditional consumers persuaded of the merits of having their own Ford parked on the drive. Meanwhile, society can hope for safer roads and greener, cleaner electric vehicles: it makes little sense for the champions of autonomy to trumpet fewer road deaths while still poisoning humans with dirty air. However, generations brought up on the hollow promise that increased automation could bring greater leisure might be sceptical of the claims for an autonomous future. While there is great appeal in the idea of reclining with a drink inside one\u2019s Ford Fiesta, circa 2030, oblivious to the congested M25 the car is safely navigating, the sliproad to this nirvana may be bumpy. Witness the travails of some of Tesla\u2019s staff, in the pioneering factory in Fremont, reportedly suffering all too human problems as their billionaire visionary boss, Elon Musk, ramps up production. Will autonomy bring more freedom? Possibly, but it runs counter to the prevailing mood, where politicians appeal to the public with promises of taking back control. And it would be difficult to dismiss as simple luddites those drivers who just see another form of employment poised to disappear. Hackett was described by the Financial Times as Ford\u2019s new \u201cphilosopher-in-chief\u201d, in an industry that is having to reimagine its product and future consumers in radical ways. The putative roadmap to a world where vehicles are all capable of full autonomy, negotiating every aspect of every journey, is thought by most to be at its most hazardous halfway along. The point at which the driver can allow most \u2013 but not all \u2013 functions to be conducted by the car, and the roads are still shared by humans and machines, is where most pioneers in the field \u2013 and insurers \u2013 foresee trouble. Ford has been reported to be focusing its energies on vehicles one step beyond this, a car where the human driver is all but redundant. That vehicle is likely to exist in four years. The challenge for the motor industry\u2019s philosophers is how to get those who will have to share the road with it ready for its arrival. Gambling industry bets the wrong way on FOBTs They are the bookmaking industry\u2019s cash cows. Fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) are controversial machines that let punters stake \u00a3100 every 20 seconds. And bookies now suck 56% of their revenue \u2013 more than \u00a31.8bn a year \u2013 from these electronic casino machines, according to the Gambling Commission. That means each machine brings in nearly \u00a353,000 a year. Of course, that money does not simply disappear out of the economy. The taxman takes a chunk \u2013 about \u00a3400m at last count. The Association of British Bookmakers says this money would be at risk if a government review, due within weeks, recommends that maximum stakes are cut. This would also, they say, force the closure of high street betting shops, leading to job losses. But this argument assumes no positive effect at all from stake reduction. A recent study by Landman Economics concluded that FOBTs are actually a drain on the economy, even when their tax contribution is taken into account. (Although it should be said that the report was commissioned by an anti-FOBT group, the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, which bookmakers say has links to the casino industry.) The report\u2019s author, Howard Reed, former chief economist at the Institute for Public Policy Research, is no casino shill. He has calculated the net effect of the machines to be a \u00a31.3bn loss to the Treasury. There are also indirect costs such as police callouts when punters smash machines \u2013 such a common occurrence that CCTV footage of such incidents is easily found on YouTube. Insiders expect the government to respond to public concern by reducing FOBT stakes, albeit not to the \u00a32 maximum promised by both Labour and the Liberal Democrats in their election manifestos. But if that happens, bookmakers will have only themselves to blame. Instead of meeting critics halfway or proposing solutions, they have engaged in a PR war, deciding that attack is the best form of defence. That is looking less and less like the smart bet. A weak clothing market \u2013 or just weak excuses? The month must be May, because there\u2019s another revival plan under way at Marks &amp; Spencer, and another chief executive trying to explain why it isn\u2019t going well. A year after taking charge at the retailer, Steve Rowe blamed weakening sales on a generally weak clothing market and a reduction in discounting. There was another serious worry too. Marks &amp; Spencer posted a decline in food sales \u2013 they were down 2.1% in the first three months of this year, although this was partly the result of the later timing of Easter. With consumers now facing a cash squeeze, clothing and food retailers cannot afford to miss a step. M&amp;S must up its game, moving away from former boss Marc Bolland\u2019s focus on increasing profit margins towards giving shoppers a better deal on quality, style and price. Middle-aged women have little choice if they want stylish clothes, so if M&amp;S can finally provide, Rowe won\u2019t need to make any more excuses.",

      "bodyText": "City types have often debated whether Bob Diamond\u2019s impressively dark locks would retain their hue should he be caught in a heavy rain shower. But, as a City figure, Bob the Banker has been remarkably enduring. He is back in action this week with the annual general meeting of Atlas Mara, the London-listed African investment vehicle he founded after being ousted from Barclays in 2012 over the Libor rate-rigging scandal \u2013 which has proved a total disaster. Its shares have steadily fallen from more than $12 to around $2.50 now, and Diamond had to step in as chairman after the departure of Arnold Ekpe. John Vitalo, who worked for Diamond when he ran Barclays, also abruptly left Atlas Mara in February and has yet to be replaced. Anyway, that makes Diamond the main draw at Wednesday\u2019s meeting \u2013 to be held in New York \u2013 when investors will obviously want to know when the company plans to sort this mess out, as well as (possibly) asking: \u201cWhat is that thing Bob the Banker has brought with him?\u201d Diamond has been spotted around the Square Mile of late sporting a Paul Hollywood-style grey goatee beard which, apart from failing to quite match his coiffure, keeps distracting those in meetings from a) maintaining eye contact and b) important matters at hand. Maybe that\u2019s the point. Big data week There won\u2019t be much going on in the corporate world this week, and the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s diary for the next seven days looks a tad sparse, too. (\u201cThere are no publications or announcements for the operational note this week,\u201d it reads.) But if you like economic statistics (and who doesn\u2019t?) there\u2019s a packed fixture list. On Thursday, it\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI figures, which \u201cwill provide a further pointer on whether the UK\u2019s export-focused manufacturers continue to benefit from past, post-Brexit vote, falls in the pound\u201d, Investec reckons. There\u2019s also the GfK consumer confidence survey for May, providing the latest look at how perky the British punter is feeling \u2013 what with inflation starting to outpace wage rises. Obviously, all that has an inevitable Brexit angle, but that may also be true for the big US economic data announcement of the week. The non-farm payrolls (a measure of the number of people in employment, excluding a few sectors such as agriculture) are out just after supposed comments from President Trump about Brexit costing US jobs. That would seemingly be a U-turn, you\u2019ll be astonished to learn. Doing the sums As the political parties concentrate on the final full week of campaigning, currency traders will be punting on what the election means for the pound. One explanation given for dips in sterling\u2019s value against the dollar last week was traders getting spooked by a Labour boost in the polls. As a rule, City traders tend not to view a potential Labour government with much enthusiasm. Still, to be fair to them, traders\u2019 lives tend to work out slightly less disastrously if they can view everything as a binary choice (lager chaser or another sambuca?), which is why there may be some concern for how they\u2019ll play the currency markets this week, following Friday\u2019s assessment by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The thinktank reckons neither of the two main parties \u201chas set out an honest set of choices\u201d, with the Tory focus on cutting immigration risking a \u00a36bn hit to the exchequer, while continued austerity could prove impossible to deliver without causing serious damage to services. Meanwhile, the IFS said that Labour\u2019s proposals would raise taxes to record levels for peacetime, while the party\u2019s plans for taxing the rich may \u201cnot raise anything like\u201d the expected \u00a348.6bn and could be \u201ceconomically damaging\u201d.

      "body": "<p>City types have often debated whether Bob Diamond\u2019s impressively dark locks would retain their hue should he be caught in a heavy rain shower. But, as a City figure, Bob the Banker has been remarkably enduring.</p> <p>He is back in action this week with the annual general meeting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/08/bob-diamond-returns-city-africa-banking\" title=\"\">Atlas Mara, the London-listed African investment vehicle</a> he founded after being ousted from Barclays in 2012 over the Libor rate-rigging scandal \u2013 which has proved a total disaster.</p> <p>Its shares have steadily fallen from more than $12 to around $2.50 now, and Diamond had to step in as chairman after the departure of Arnold Ekpe. John Vitalo, who worked for Diamond when he ran Barclays, also abruptly left Atlas Mara in February and has yet to be replaced.</p> <p>Anyway, that makes Diamond the main draw at Wednesday\u2019s meeting \u2013 to be held in New York \u2013 when investors will obviously want to know when the company plans to sort this mess out, as well as (possibly) asking: \u201cWhat is that thing Bob the Banker has brought with him?\u201d</p> <p>Diamond has been spotted around the Square Mile of late sporting a Paul Hollywood-style grey goatee beard which, apart from failing to quite match his coiffure, keeps distracting those in meetings from a) maintaining eye contact and b) important matters at hand. Maybe that\u2019s the point.</p> <h2>Big data week</h2> <p>There won\u2019t be much going on in the corporate world this week, and the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s diary for the next seven days looks a tad sparse, too. (\u201cThere are no publications or announcements for the operational note this week,\u201d it reads.)</p> <p>But if you like economic statistics (and who doesn\u2019t?) there\u2019s a packed fixture list. On Thursday, it\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI figures, which \u201cwill provide a further pointer on whether the UK\u2019s export-focused manufacturers continue to benefit from past, post-Brexit vote, falls in the pound\u201d, Investec reckons. There\u2019s also the GfK consumer confidence survey for May, providing the latest look at how perky the British punter is feeling \u2013 what with inflation starting to outpace wage rises.</p> <p>Obviously, all that has an inevitable Brexit angle, but that may also be true for the big US economic data announcement of the week. The non-farm payrolls (a measure of the number of people in employment, excluding a few sectors such as agriculture) are out just after supposed comments from President Trump about Brexit costing US jobs. That would seemingly be a U-turn, you\u2019ll be astonished to learn.</p> <h2>Doing the sums</h2> <p>As the political parties concentrate on the final full week of campaigning, currency traders will be punting on what the election means for the pound.</p> <p>One explanation given for dips in sterling\u2019s value against the dollar last week was traders getting spooked by a Labour boost in the polls. As a rule, City traders tend not to view a potential Labour government with much enthusiasm.</p> <p>Still, to be fair to them, traders\u2019 lives tend to work out slightly less disastrously if they can view everything as a binary choice (lager chaser or another sambuca?), which is why there may be some concern for how they\u2019ll play the currency markets this week, following Friday\u2019s assessment by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.</p> <p>The thinktank reckons neither of the two main parties \u201chas set out an honest set of choices\u201d, with the Tory focus on cutting immigration risking a \u00a36bn hit to the exchequer, while continued austerity could prove impossible to deliver without causing serious damage to services.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the IFS said that Labour\u2019s proposals would raise taxes to record levels for peacetime, while the party\u2019s plans for taxing the rich may \u201cnot raise anything like\u201d the expected \u00a348.6bn and could be \u201ceconomically damaging\u201d.
