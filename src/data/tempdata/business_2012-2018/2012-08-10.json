Sir David Walker, a former Morgan Stanley executive, Bank of England and Treasury official and the author of a key report on the banking system, was named on Thursday night as a replacement for current Barclays' chairman Marcus Agius. Barclays' shares reacted with a 4.45p gain to 183.4p, making them the biggest riser in an otherwise moribund market. Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood said the new chairman ticked all the right boxes: We struggle to see how the board could have found a better candidate for the role given his long career in financial services, including both investment banking and retail banking, close connections with the Treasury and Bank of England, and his keen interest in corporate governance via the Walker Review.

Although its shares have recovered from their lows - they slumped to \u00a310.92 at one point - they are still more than 15% down since the scandal broke. Investors feared Standard could lose its US banking licence, although it came out fighting against the charges. Overall the FTSE 100 dipped 4.40 points to 5847.11 after five days of rises, in the wake of worse than expected Chinese trade data, which showed lower than forecast imports and exports and raised fears of a sharp slowdown in the country's economy. But over the week the leading index has climbed 60 points - albeit in thin trading with the usual summer lull exaggerated by the rival attractions of the Olympics. Prudential put on 6p to 810p following a 13% rise in half year operating profits to \u00a31.16bn. Rival Aviva recovered 6.9p to 323.6p after Thursday's dip in the wake of a larger than expected drop in profits. Deutsche Bank raised its target from 350p to 370p following the figures, with a buy recommendation. Marks &amp; Spencer was steady at 350.6p. The retailer has been in the doldrums since its recent trading update disappointed investors, with the exception of a burst of excitement early last week on renewed takeover speculation. But Morgan Stanley, which acts as the retailer's broker, believes the fall has been overdone. The bank said: Whilst M&amp;S's first quarter trading update was poor, we think many commentators have over-reacted to it.

It said M&amp;S's food business, which accounts for half its sales, was outperforming most of its quoted peers, while the clothing business, while struggling at the moment, had been gaining market share in recent years: M&amp;S consensus earnings per share forecasts for 2012 are broadly in line with those when Marc Bolland took over as chief executive in May 2010 (despite the macro-economic situation having weakened significantly). Reports that bankers were lining the retailer up as a \u00a36bn bid target after its recent decline put some life into the shares on Monday, although analysts were unconvinced by the tale. Still with retailers, Ocado dropped 2p to 71p after Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan said the online grocer might breach its covenants this year. Dixons Retail rose 1.7% to 16.27p after it paid \u20ac10m to take full ownership of European online business Pixmania. It is buying the 22% held by the company's founders to take its shareholding to 99%, allowing it to full day to day control of the loss making business. The remaining 1% is held by staff. Pixmania supplies an e-merchant platform for Dixons as well as services to other businesses. Analyst Nick Bubb said: Dixons says that this move will enable it \"to take the decisive actions necessary to improve Pixmania's performance\" (like closing it down?). Kate Calvert at Seymour Pierce said: Pixmania last year lost \u00a319.8m, and we are forecasting similar losses in the current year. We view this as a positive step as management needs to address the weak performance of Pixmania and its southern European businesses, though this will take time given the impact austerity measures are likely to have on consumer discretionary spending going forward. Elsewhere Intertek, which supplies testing services for a range of products from toys to oil and minerals, added 6p to \u00a327.84 after Citigroup raised its price target from \u00a328 to \u00a331.5. The bank said: Intertek offers the purest available exposure to global consumer testing's attractive economics. It also provides exposure to the [testing industry] consolidation story, where Intertek looks to be both acquirer and potential target. As the smallest of the three testing operators, Intertek can still make a material impact on its equity value through mid-sized (\u00a3100m plus) deals, as demonstrated by 2011's acquisition of Moody International [for \u00a3450m]. Finally, Flybe fell 15% to 64p after the regional airline cut its full year revenue target due to the weak consumer environment and high fuel prices.",

      "bodyText": "Prudential boss Tidjane Thiam indicated on Friday that the company would remain based in the UK despite fears that it might relocate to Asia because of new capital rules for European insurers. Britain's biggest insurer warned in March that the Solvency II rules under discussion in Brussels risked destroying its American business and could force it out of the UK, with Hong Kong seen as the most likely new domicile. But Thiam said today that negotiations had been going well and that the UK government and the Financial Services Authority had been \"very supportive\". If Brussels does not recognise US regulations as an \"equivalent\" regime, Prudential could be forced to hold billions of pounds of extra capital against its American life insurance business, Jackson. This would put it at a severe disadvantage to its US rivals, and Prudential remains committed to the world's largest retirement market. While the outcome of Solvency II is still uncertain and Prudential's review of its domicile is ongoing, Thiam said: \"It seems to indicate we'll get US equivalence.\" He added, however: \"If that issue is not resolved, we would have to reconsider where to be domiciled, and Hong Kong is an option.\" Hong Kong was Prudential's largest business in Asia for a long time but has now been overtaken by Indonesia.

As the London-based bank prepares for a hearing with New York state's department of finance services regulator, which has accused it of moving $250bn of Iranian money around the financial system, the chancellor has sought assurances that the bank will be treated fairly. Osborne and his team spoke to Geithner and officials on Tuesday and received assurances that the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) would work with the myriad of other regulators looking at Standard Chartered's dealing with Iranian clients between 2001 and 2007. Sir Meryvn King, the governor of the Bank of England, had already called publicly for the US regulators to work together after the surprise decision by the New York regulator to publish an order against Standard Chartered on Monday. While the bank had known since 2010 it was being investigated for breaches of sanctions \u2013 it had shared information with regulators \u2013 it had not expected the New York regulator to go it alone in making public the alleged range of the breaches of the rules. A government source said the chancellor had been deploying quiet diplomacy in contacting his US counterpart amid claims that some US politicians were trying to undermine London's position as a financial centre. Osborne, however, is thought to have made clear that breaches of rules should not be tolerated. The credit rating agency Fitch warned on Thursday that it might downgrade the bank's credit rating as result of the accusations, which the bank strongly denies. Fitch said: \"The accusations and strong market reactions to it have damaged the bank's reputation and it is possible that its franchise will suffer depending on how and when the case is resolved.\" There is speculation that the regulators would agree on a fine for the bank before Wednesday's hearing although this seems unlikely given the scale the disagreement between Standard Chartered and the regulatory bodies. Peter Sands, the bank's chief executive, argues that while the regulator is focusing on $250bn of payments channelled for Iranian clients, the bank believes that the sum is closer to $14m. The discrepancies relate to interpretation of the rules on U-turns which allow the banks to deal with Iranian clients as long as the money does not end up in US bank accounts.",
