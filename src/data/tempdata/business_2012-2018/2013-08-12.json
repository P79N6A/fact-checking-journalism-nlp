      "bodyText": "Paul Walsh, the former boss of drinks company Diageo, is to be paid \u00a380,000 a year to continue to represent his former employer in the Scotch whisky industry after receiving almost \u00a315m in cash and long-term bonuses from the company in its most recent financial year. Walsh, now incoming chairman of the contract caterer Compass, stepped down as chief executive in June after 13 years and will keep around 1m share options that could pay out millions of pounds in the years ahead, according to the company's annual report. The number of options will not be reduced to take account of his retirement, when he left the company with a near \u00a318m pension pot. The annual report also revealed an unspecified number of senior managers at the company made a total of \u00a356.7m from cashing in share options during the year. It provided the total of \u00a314.7m for Walsh's pay in 2013 \u2013 to comply with new guidelines to provide a single figure for an executive's pay. This includes \u00a31.3m of salary and benefits, an annual bonus of \u00a31.2m with the remainder comprising long-term bonuses. Another figure of \u00a316.1m was provided to cover all the options and long-term incentive plans which paid out to him during the financial year when ended in June but much of this total will be contained in the single figure provided by the company. Although Walsh has already left Diageo, he will remain employed until June next year to \"ensure an efficient and comprehensive transition\" to his replacement Ivan Menezes, who will have a salary of \u00a31m. Walsh will represent Diageo at the Scottish Whisky Association for up to five years. The company said 83% of Walsh's \u00a314.7m total pay was based on the share price. The value of the company has risen from \u00a320bn to \u00a347bn between 2010 and 2013.",

The document provides few clues about which firms will be required to set a target, what the target should be or precisely what it means by \"management bodies\". It is likely to apply to just a handful of the biggest players. The demand from Brussels comes just weeks after the recommendation by the independent commission on banking standards that banks conduct an audit of the number of women on their \"overwhelmingly male\" trading floors. It also follows Lord Davies' recommendations on gender balance when he called for 25% female representation in FTSE 100 boardrooms by 2015. But Davies' recommendation is voluntary, while the government has only adopted the audit of trading floors as \"best practice\". The PRA, however, has clout when adopting the EU directive. It is a moment for the regulator to demonstrate that it will not tolerate glib statements of intent that make little difference in practice.",

It is likely to apply to just a handful of the biggest players.</p> <p>The demand from Brussels comes just weeks after the recommendation by the independent commission on banking standards that banks conduct an audit of the number of women on their \"overwhelmingly male\" trading floors. It also follows Lord Davies' recommendations on gender balance when he called for 25% female representation in FTSE 100 boardrooms by 2015. But Davies' recommendation is voluntary, while the government has only adopted the audit of trading floors as \"best practice\".</p> <p>The PRA, however, has clout when adopting the EU directive. It is a moment for the regulator to demonstrate that it will not tolerate glib statements of intent that make little difference in practice.</p>",

He said the creation of Prudential Corporation Asia was intended to simply the business which, for instance, ran Hong Kong as a branch of its UK arm.</p> <p>Its fortunes in the UK, where it was once fabled for its \"man from the Pru\" door to door salesmen, contrasted with the growth in Asia and the US, where it operates under the brand Jackson Life. In the UK profits from new business fell 14% and operating profit was flat while in Asia operating profit increased 18% and in the US rose 32%, leading to a total rise in operating profit of 22% to \u00a31.4bn.</p> <p>Its fund management arm, M&amp;G, reported record operating profit on a 17% rise.

      "bodyText": "Shares in Prudential jumped to an all time highon Monday after the insurer said baby boomers in the US and fast growing Asian markets had bolstered its first-half profits. Chief executive Tidjane Thiam insisted the share price could go still higher after gaining more than 150% since January 2009 \u2013 a rise three times as fast as the FTSE 100. Thiam, personally censured by the City regulator five months ago over his handling of a botched Asian takeover bid in 2010, attempted to quash any fears that a slowdown in Asia could stymie the group's growth. \"As part of the huge rebalancing taking place in the world economy, Asia is expected to deliver $21tn (\u00a313.5tn) of GDP over the next two decades, the equivalent of six new economies the size of Germany,\" Thiam said. \"This is an epochal transformation, with hundreds of millions of people being lifted out of poverty and acquiring middle-class status, creating a powerful demand for insurance products for decades to come,\" Thiam said. He acknowledged that a decision to unite its 13 businesses in Asia under a new holding company would make it easier to break up the Pru \u2013 a regular question faced by the insurer \u2013 but insisted this was not the intention. \"It is a longrunning story of an imperial legacy,\" said Thiam. He said the creation of Prudential Corporation Asia was intended to simply the business which, for instance, ran Hong Kong as a branch of its UK arm. Its fortunes in the UK, where it was once fabled for its \"man from the Pru\" door to door salesmen, contrasted with the growth in Asia and the US, where it operates under the brand Jackson Life. In the UK profits from new business fell 14% and operating profit was flat while in Asia operating profit increased 18% and in the US rose 32%, leading to a total rise in operating profit of 22% to \u00a31.4bn. Its fund management arm, M&amp;G, reported record operating profit on a 17% rise. The shares closed up 4% at \u00a312.12.

Thank you for reading and for all the comments. A quick look ahead to the key data out on Tuesday before we go. Overnight in the UK we have the latest RICS housing market report based on a survey of estate agents. In recent months it has shown momentum building in the market. German July inflation data is out at 7am UK time and the consensus is for an annual rate of 1.9% in July, unchanged from June. As previewed earlier, UK inflation data for July due at 9.30am are expected to show a slight easing in price pressures. Factory gate prices for the UK are out at the same time. Next up, Germany's ZEW survey at 10am is expected to show an improvement in economic sentiment and current conditions according to analysts and investors after an unexpected deterioration last month. Eurozone industrial production data for June is also due at 10am and is expected to show monthly growth of 0.8% after a decline of 0.3% the month before. In a preview of that industrial production release, Ben May at Capital Economics comments: June\u2019s industrial production figures will probably show that production in the euro-zone expanded for the fifth time in seven months. The national data available for June have been a mixed bag. Production plunged by 1.4% in France and inched down slightly in Spain. But production in Italy rose by 0.3%, while Germany recorded a substantial rise of 2.5%. Based on these figures, we expect a rise of 0.8% on the month in the euro-zone as a whole. This would raise the annual growth rate from -1.3% to about zero. Finally, in the US, retail sales data for July are out at 1.30pm and expected to show a 0.3% rise after June's 0.4% increase. The post-match analysis following Mark Carney's first inflation report as Bank of England governor continues. Duncan Weldon, economist at the TUC, has just posted his take on last week's Bank of England guidance on rates staying ultra-low and the UK government's reaction. The full post - Low Interest Rates: Celebrating Failure - is on his blog. An extract: Record low interest rates are not a sign of a healthy economy; they are sign of a distressed economy that is struggling to grow. The real message of last week\u2019s Bank of England press conference is that the Bank thinks there is an awful lot of spare capacity in the economy and it isn\u2019t sure there is much it can do in the short run to deal with that. Interest rates are set to remain at \u2018record lows\u2019 for the next three years not because things are going well but because unemployment is expected to remain at elevated levels until then. Good afternoon. Katie Allen here taking over from my colleague Angela for the last part of the day. Markets are in full summer mode, as are most people working in them according to this tweet: With less than an hour to go, the FTSE 100 in London is closing in on positive territory, currently down just 5.3 points, or less than 0.1%, at 6578. Germany's DAX is up 0.3% at 8364 and France's CAC40 is down 0.1% at 4072. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets UK says there is a \"general lack of enthusiasm by investors, combined with some concern about the prospect of a third Greek bailout, after weekend reports about a Bundesbank document outlining just such a prospect, doing the rounds.\" He continues: As a result we have seen European markets slip into negative territory as increasingly mixed messages from Fed officials continues to sew confusion as to the timing of any US central bank move on stimulus. There has also been an awful lot of weekend chatter about the prospects of a return to growth in the European economy in data due out later this week; however this doesn\u2019t appear to have translated itself into the overall psyche for today. In the US, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.1% at 15435 while the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.1% at 1690. Anticipation is building ahead of the eurozone's second-quarter GDP figures on Wednesday. The consensus expectation among economists is that official figures will show the region's economy grew by 0.2% compared with the first quarter, driven forward by Germany. It would end the recession blighting the eurozone after six successive quarters of decline. Nick Kounis, ABN Amro: \u201cThe second quarter should mark the end of the recession in the euro area, but the recovery will be excruciatingly slow. We\u2019re not getting the champagne out yet.\u201d Laurence Boone, Bank of America Merrill Lynch: There\u2019s still some fiscal adjustment going on and that\u2019s weighing on consumption, as well as banks in the south not being in a position to support the economy. The consensus is for slight growth and we wouldn\u2019t expect anything much more buoyant than that.\u201d Dow Jones: -0.3% S&amp;P 500: -0.3% Last week's declines have been extended in early trading after the weaker than expected Japanese GDP data. European markets also remain in the red: FTSE 100: -0.2% CAC 40: -0.3% DAX 30: -0.2% IBEX: -0.2% After a prolonged spell of misery in Greece it seemed there might finally be cause for quiet cheers when official figures on Monday morning showed the recession eased in the second quarter. However Ben May, European economist at Capital Economics, has warned the so-called Troika's forecasts still look too optimistic, and Greece is to need another major debt restructuring. He writes: While the recession is easing, the improvement in the economic situation has been much less pronounced than the business surveys had suggested. Looking further ahead, we are still sceptical that the economy will experience a full-blown economic recovery next year, as assumed in the forecasts which underpin the Greek adjustment programme. Despite their recapitalisation, banks still appear to be unwilling or unable to lend. Meanwhile, there is still little sign of any improvement in the labour market. What\u2019s more, due to the Government\u2019s wafer-thin majority, there is a risk that it may not be able to comply fully with future conditions of its bail-out. For now, then, we still think that the economy will contract by about 2% next year, implying that Greece will need further loans to fully cover its financing needs. In case you missed it, here is a blog from the Guardian's economics editor Larry Elliott on the Chancellor's reliance on monetary stimulus for growth. He writes: Carney was parachuted into the Bank by George Osborne with the brief of making Threadneedle Street a more growth-friendly institution and he has wasted no time in getting on with the job. The chancellor has done his bit to pump up growth through his subsidies to the housing market, but he expects most of the heavy lifting to be done by the Bank. Hence last week's commitment to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.5% until unemployment comes down from 7.8% to 7% or less. Hence, also, the concerns about the Bank's independence and its credibility... Do you believe Mark Carney has lived up to expectations as Bank of England governor? Vote in our poll here. The Greek recession eased in the second quarter with a 4.6% fall in GDP. It was the 20th consecutive quarterly contraction. Germany has played down speculation that Greece will need another bailout next year, saying it is making \"good progress\" with reforms. European stock markets are down by less than 1%. Japanese growth slowed more than expected in the second quarter to an annual rate of 2.6%. Slowing growth could be used to boost the argument for delaying a planned rise in Japan's sales tax rate. Lending to first-time buyers is at the highest level since 2007 according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Russia's economic development minister Alexei Ulyukayev says the economy is stagnant but not heading for recession. Looking ahead to tomorrow, official data are expected to show annual UK inflation slowed modestly to 2.8% in July from 2.9% in June. Economists at Investec predict the June Consumer Prices Index will prove to be the peak, with inflation potentially falling below the Bank of England's 2% target in early 2014. Clothing and food prices are expected to have proved a drag on inflation in July. Read a full preview on the inflation data from Katie Allen here. Labour's shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant has retreated over claims made over the weekend that Next and Tesco choose cheaper foreign workers at the expense of local British candidates. Both retailers have hit back over the suggestion they are \"unscrupulous employers\". Read the full story from our political correspondent Rowena Mason here. Following on from Der Spiegel's report on the possibility that Greece will need another bailiout next year, the German finance ministry has resoponded. Spokesman Martin Kotthaus said he was not aware of an internal Bundesbank document cited by the magazine and said it was difficult to speculate: The latest troika report finds that Greece is making good progress with its reforms. As you know, the current programme runs until 2014, so I find it difficult to speculate now about what will happen in 2014. Greek finance ministry figures published today showed the country easily beat its fiscal targets in the first seven months of the year, supported by European funds. The Greek government had a primary budget surplus of \u20ac2.57bn (\u00a32.2bn), before interest payments, compared with an interim target of a deficit of \u20ac3.14bn. It wasn't all good news though. This from Reuters: About half of that \u20ac5.7bn overshoot is explained by the fact that Athens received more European Union subsidies than expected and also spent far less of them on investment projects than initially planned, the figures showed. The figures also include about \u20ac1.5bn in one-off revenue from euro zone central banks. This money derives from profits which the central banks earned from Greek government bonds they held and which they returned to Athens under the terms of its international bailout. By contrast, gross tax revenues are about \u20ac1.5bn behind target, hit by a severe, six-year recession which has wiped out about a quarter of the country's economy. At the same time, Athens cut primary spending by 10% to \u20ac25.1bn, beating its interim target by \u20ac1.88bn. Early (but modest) optimism seems to have lost steam with all the major indices in Europe now down. FTSE 100: -0.4% CAC 40: -0.6% DAX 30: -1.1% IBEX: -0.3% Greek GDP fell by 4.6% in the second quarter, compared with the same period last year. That is better than the 5% contraction predicted by economists, and better than the 5.6% contraction in the first quarter. It was the 20th successive quarter of contraction, but the slowest rate since the third quarter of 2011 according to the Greek statistics agency. Back in the UK and the Council of Mortgage Lenders brings more evidence of rising activity in the housing market. Lending to first-time buyers hit its highest quarterly level since 2007 in the second quarter, with 68,200 buying their first home. First-time buyers accounted for 46% of all house purchase loans in June, up from 44% in May and higher than the 38% seen on average since 2007. A total of 151,600 loans were granted for all house purchases in the second quarter, up 30% compared with first quarter and 17% compared with the same period last year. Commenting after the figures, IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer said: It is looking ever more likely that house prices will see marked increases over the rest of 2013 and during 2014, with the result that we are now raising our house price forecasts. We now expect house prices to rise by 3% over the rest of 2013 and to then increase by 7% in 2014. Housing market activity has been trending up recently, supported by strengthening consumer confidence and elevated employment, and fuelled by the Funding for Lending Scheme and the Help to Buy initiative. On top of this, the Bank of England has now indicated that interest rates are unlikely to rise before mid-2016, which seems likely to give many people greater confidence in their ability to purchase a house. While an improving housing market is helpful to growth prospects, it is vitally important for stability and longer-term growth prospects that a new housing price bubble does not emerge. Consequently, should the housing market gain substantial momentum over the coming months, the case for dropping the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme that is due to start in 2014 will strengthen, even if the government may find this politically difficult to do. Russia's economy is stagnating but is not in recession according to Alexei Ulyukayev, economic development minister. He warned however that weak second-quarter GDP figures might result in a cut in official forecasts. \"There is no recession. And there won't be one. Stagnation, probably, would be the appropriate term,\" he told Kommersant in an interview. The Russian economy grew by 1.2% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, missing expectations of 1.6% growth. Ulyukayev said his department would be reviewing medium and long-term forecasts with a \"more conservative estimate\" of prospects. In April it slashed its forecasts for 2013 growth to 2.4% from 3.6% previously. The slower than expected rate of growth in Japan in the second quarter raises questions over whether a planned sales tax rise will be implemented after all, as some of you have pointed out in the comments below. A current sales tax rate of 5% is scheduled to rise to 8% in April 2014 and to 10% in October 2015 in a bid to reduce the nation's debt pile. However, there are already hints from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's corner that the policy might delayed, particularly amid slowing growth. Reuters quotes Koichi Hamada, a key adviser to Abe and a professor emeritus at Yale University: There is no need to raise the sales tax in a hurry. One idea is to delay everything by one year. I feel that raising the sales tax as scheduled might hurt the economy. Abe was elected last December on a programme of stimulus to boost the economy, and so-called 'Abenomics' resulted in a rise in equities, consumer spending, and a weaker yen. The Q2 GDP data could support the case for a delay to the sales tax rise. Abe said on Monday: The economy has been steadily rising since the inauguration of the Abe administration last year. I'll continue to take all possible care about the economy. I'd like to focus on the economy, including implementation of further growth strategies in the autumn. Over to India now and the country's trade ministry has reported an 11.6% rise in exports in July to $25.8bn (\u00a316.7bn) compared with June. Imports fell 6.2% to $38.1bn. The trade deficit was largely unchanged at $12.3bn. All eyes will be on Greece at 10am (UK time) as it publishes growth estimates for the second quarter. Economists are expecting the data to show the economy shrank at an annual rate of 5%, compared with 5.6% in the first quarter. A report in Der Spiegel over the weekend suggested Germany's Bundesbank expects Greece to see additional rescue loans from its European partners by the start of 2014 at the very latest. This from Reuters: The report could rekindle a debate in Germany about whether Chancellor Angela Merkel is deliberately playing down the prospects of further help for Greece before next month's election. Opposition parties, notably Social Democrat (SPD) challenger Peer Steinbrueck, have accused her of covering up the risks that German taxpayers will have to fund further eurozone bailouts. Greece has received two European Union/International Monetary Fund bailouts totalling \u20ac240bn and has drawn down 90% of those funds. The package is due to expire at the end of 2014. The Spiegel report cited what it said was a Bundesbank report for the German finance ministry and the IMF. In the document, the bank predicts that European governments \"will certainly agree a new aid programme for Greece\" by early 2014 at the latest, Spiegel said. The Spanish IBEX has opened down 0.2% but investors in France and Germany are slightly more positive: CAC 40: +0.2% DAX 30: +0.2% The UK's index of leading shares is rising (just) in early trading, up 0.1% at 6,593. However optimism could be running low in the US later according to CMC Markets' Michael Hewson: Having posted their worst week since June, US markets have started to give the impression of having run out of steam as a run of 5 positive weeks out of 6 came to a shuddering halt last Friday. It would appear that investors could be starting to become concerned about the direction of travel with respect to commentary from Fed officials about the timing of tapering. Given the proximity to all-time highs it appears that prudence is taking precedence over risk, with little in the way of new factors to stimulate new buying. Despite the slower than expected growth in Japan, Will Hedden of IG expects investors to be fairly upbeat when the markets open. Good morning all. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. It promises to be an interesting week in the UK, with markets closely watching the latest inflation data, minutes of the August meeting of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee meeting, and unemployment figures. The jobless figures will be all the more keenly watched after the Bank's new governor Mark Carney revealed last week that future interest rates will be tied to the unemployment rate. He said interest rates will not rise until the jobless rates falls below 7%. At last count it was 7.8%. All that is to come later in the week, but back to today and there are some disappointing GDP numbers from Japan. The economy grew at an annualised rate of 2.6% between April and June, below a forecast of 3.6% growth and below the 3.8% growth achieved in the first quarter. The Nikkei 225 fell 0.7% on the data, which showed an unexpected drop in capital expenditure in a sign that businesses are not feeling sufficiently confident to invest. Consumer spending rose as people spent more on food, travel and consumer electronics.",
