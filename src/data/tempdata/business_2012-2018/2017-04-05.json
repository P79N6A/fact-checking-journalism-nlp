      "bodyText": "Note to Deliveroo\u2019s bosses: if you have to perform verbal gymnastics to maintain the appearance that your workers are self-employed, it\u2019s probably time to admit you would fail a commonsense test. Deliveroo\u2019s \u201crider vocabulary guidelines\u201d are six pages of linguistic contortion. Even tiny words create legal minefields that head office staff must tiptoe around. Nobody works \u201cfor\u201d the company because \u201cindependent suppliers\u201d are working \u201cwith\u201d it. One must not refer to \u201cour\u201d riders \u2013 it\u2019s \u201cthe rider community.\u201d Members of this supposedly happy-go-lucky community do not wear a uniform, as regular employees might at regular delivery companies. At Deliveroo, the branded clothes are part of an \u201cequipment pack\u201d that individuals purchase from a \u201csupply centre\u201d and not from a \u201chiring office\u201d. It goes on. Earnings are fees, payslips are invoices and performance targets are delivery standards. It\u2019s all designed to convince HMRC and the outside world that the setup uses self-employed riders and thus does not need to pay employer\u2019s national insurance, contribute to pensions or offer holiday pay. The savings for the company are substantial: on a worker earning \u00a325,000 a year, it\u2019s probably about \u00a32,000. The legal challenges to this arrangement will keep coming, as they should. Deliveroo, like Uber, may own some whizzy technology that enables supply and demand to be matched efficiently, but its other competitive advantage seems to be a grubby form of arbitrage between the letter of the law and its spirit. Allied Minds\u2019s enormous writedown Did you miss Allied Minds, the wonder stock of late 2014? The pitch was potent: a technological lab with privileged access to the best technological ideas from US universities and federal government institutions. It always seemed odd that an investor in US startups was listing in London, but perhaps that was because Allied had been backed for years by lauded UK fund manager Neil Woodford and his former colleagues at Invesco, which only added to the appeal. From a float price of 190p, the shares hit 700p within a year. Now they\u2019re 185p, down 29% on Wednesday and half their value on the day last month that long-serving chief executive Chris Silva stepped down \u201cby mutual consent.\u201d New boss Jill Smith is halting investment in seven out of 23 subsidiaries. The writedown will be $147m (\u00a3118m), which is enormous when one recalls that the directors\u2019 last stab at the worth of the entire group\u2019s assets was $535m. That estimate, note, was reiterated as recently as last December, when Allied Minds raised \u00a364m from shareholders. The generous interpretation says a spot of portfolio pruning goes with the territory when you\u2019re investing in young businesses, not all of which will achieve commercial returns. Capital has to flow to the best prospects. Yet isn\u2019t the process meant to be slow and methodical? A radical writedown of seven investments only four months after a fundraising may suggest the board was previously wearing rose-tinted spectacles, which is what Allied Minds\u2019 critics always argued. Smith didn\u2019t address the point on Wednesday. She can\u2019t avoid it when the group reports full-year numbers later this month. A neat escape by Bovis Homes The all-share offer from Galliford Try was probably too mean to succeed anyway, but Bovis has gone one better. It has hired Galliford\u2019s old boss, Greg Fitzgerald, to be its new chief executive. Fitzgerald is a star act in the housebuilding game. He expanded Galliford massively during his decade in charge before retiring in 2015, so his arrival is cheerful news for Bovis shareholders. The company\u2019s catastrophic end to 2016 led to a profits warning, complaints from customers about shoddy workmanship and the exit of the former boss. It looks like Bovis overreached in trying to build more quickly. If so, a no-nonsense operator like Fitzgerald could be ideal. Improving the business, rather than flogging it, always seemed the sensible course. One suspects the 53-year-old Fitzgerald, a rich man from his Galliford years, hasn\u2019t taken the job merely because he\u2019s bored of fiddling around with his own plant hire company. He probably calculates that, if Bovis can stop shooting itself in the foot, he can add substantially to his wealth. The business has 19,000 plots with planning consent, mostly in the south and south-east, so the foundations ought to be decent. Forget the \u00a3650,000 salary and 200% LTIP; the revealing detail will be how much of his own money Fitzgerald decides to punt on top.",

      "bodyText": "Workers at BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars are to hold a series of 24-hour strikes at factories across the UK in a dispute about pensions. The Unite union said the eight strikes would significantly disrupt production of Minis and called on BMW, the owner of Mini and Rolls-Royce, to hold talks to resolve the dispute. The trade union claims workers could lose up to \u00a3160,000 in retirement benefits because of the German company\u2019s plans to close its final-salary pension schemes by the end of May. BMW employs about 8,000 people in the UK. Unite has said the industrial action, scheduled to take place between 19 April and 24 May, could involve up to 3,500 workers affected by the pension changes. The strikes will have an impact on the Mini factory in Cowley, Oxfordshire, one of the biggest in the country, as well as BMW\u2019s engine plant at Hams Hall in Warwickshire, a pressings plant in Swindon and Rolls-Royce\u2019s factory in Goodwood, Sussex. BMW said it was disappointed by the strikes, which were overwhelmingly backed by Unite members in a vote this week. Len McCluskey, the union\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cBMW\u2019s refusal to talk about affordable options to keep the pension scheme open means a sizeable chunk of its UK workforce will be taking strike action for the first time in the coming weeks. \u201cBosses in the UK and BMW\u2019s headquarters in Munich cannot feign surprise that it\u2019s come to this point. Unite has repeatedly warned of the anger their insistence to railroad through the pension scheme\u2019s closure would generate and the resulting industrial action. \u201cBMW\u2019s bosses need to get their heads out of the sand and recognise their pension-pinching plans will not go unchallenged. I urge BMW to step back from its May deadline for the pension scheme\u2019s closure and negotiate seriously to find a settlement which is good for the business and good for the workforce.\u201d BMW notched up a record financial performance in 2016, despite being engulfed in the scandal over cheating diesel emissions tests in the US. Sales of its vehicles rose by 5.3% to 2.4m, including a 6.4% increase for Mini and a 6% rise for Rolls-Royce. Net profits rose 8% to \u20ac6.9bn (\u00a35.9bn). BMW said: \u201cBMW Group has always prided itself in providing excellent pensions for its staff and wants to act now to protect future pension provision and to help improve the cost competitiveness of the UK as a manufacturing base. \u201cA number of planned meetings have taken place since the start of consultation on the proposed pension changes and the company is disappointed by Unite\u2019s notification of industrial action. \u201cThe company has put a number of options on the table to help employees transition to the proposed new pension arrangements and it remains open to negotiation.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Deliveroo accused of 'creating vocabulary' to avoid calling couriers employees", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Managers at Deliveroo have been given a list of dos and don\u2019ts setting out how to talk to the firm\u2019s food delivery riders, using terms that appear designed to fend off claims that they are employees. In a six-page document seen by the Guardian, Deliveroo says its couriers, who deliver takeaways, should always be referred to as \u201cindependent suppliers\u201d \u2013 self-employed workers with few employment rights \u2013 rather than as employees, workers, staff or team members. The business models of gig-economy companies such as Deliveroo and taxi app Uber are based on using thousands of self-employed contractors rather than employees \u2013 a move that saves them millions of pounds in holiday pay, sick pay and tax. The workers have no right to the minimum wage. Deliveroo\u2019s guidance suggests that the food delivery company\u2019s own staff could become confused by the definition of the riders\u2019 role. The document provides carefully worded example sentences to explain how work practices can be described \u2013 and how they can\u2019t. Instead of hiring riders at a recruitment centre, for example, senior staff undertake \u201conboarding\u201d at a \u201csupply centre\u201d. They must also talk about riders\u2019 \u201cavailability\u201d rather than refer to shifts. As an example, it tells staff they should not tell riders, \u201cYou did not attend a shift\u201d and should instead say, \u201cYou were unavailable to accept orders at a previously agreed time.\u201d Riders\u2019 branded outfits must not be described as uniform, but only as \u201ckit\u201d or \u201cequipment\u201d. The document\u2019s list of dos and don\u2019ts also says that riders do not clock on, but log in (to the rider app), and says that staff dealing with riders pay should always refer to invoices rather than payslips. A spokesperson for Deliveroo said: \u201cWe have almost 1,000 full-time staff and work with over 15,000 riders in the UK. We ensure that employees know how to work with our partners, which includes training and guidelines to follow when talking to customers, restaurants, and of course self-employed riders.\u201d The dos and don\u2019ts document has emerged as several groups of gig-economy workers take legal action claiming the status of employees or workers, with more employment rights than self-employed contractors. They include a group of Deliveroo couriers planning action against the food delivery firm claiming better employment rights including the minimum wage, sick pay and holiday. An initial 20 delivery riders involved in the case say they are employees and not, as the company argues, self-employed contractors. In the latest challenge to employment conditions in the gig economy, the riders are seeking compensation for not receiving holiday pay and for being paid wages below the legal minimum for employees. Law firm Leigh Day, which says it has a total of 200 Deliveroo riders lined up to take similar action, argues that they are employees because they are are required to carry out a trial shift, wear a uniform and are paid at a set rate with no say on terms and conditions. Their movements are also closely monitored by Deliveroo and subject to performance review. All of this terminology falls under the \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d column in the Deliveroo document seen by the Guardian \u2013 with alternative wording supplied. It appears to indicate that language is a key factor in separating the definition of a self-employed contractor and an employee at Deliveroo. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain is also fighting for the right of union recognition at Deliveroo in Camden and Kentish Town, London. Some of the concepts central to the union\u2019s case \u2013 such as the use of zones \u2013 also fall under the \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d column. The union, which led strike action over changes to pay by riders in London last year and has also been campaigning for better pay for Brighton\u2019s Deliveroo couriers, is applying to the central arbitration committee. In May it will begin the case by deciding whether riders should be classed as self-employed or workers. Jason Moyer-Lee, the general secretary of the IWGB, said: \u201cThis document is further evidence of what the IWGB has been saying all along. Deliveroo is operating a charade with regard to its employment practices. It has even found it necessary to create a whole new vocabulary to hide what is blindingly obvious to any objective observer.\u201d Will Shu, the former investment banker who founded Deliveroo four years ago, told ITV News that he was not aware of the list of dos and don\u2019ts, but said: \u201cI feel that we\u2019re providing high-paying flexible work to a large number of people.\u201d He suggested the government needed to clarify the rules on self-employment. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to decide what the definition of self-employment is. If you\u2019re asking me do we want to give riders a level of security, not just flexibility, the answer is yes. But we\u2019re going to have to work on the government in deciding what self-employment actually means.\u2019\u2019 Successful employment tribunal cases have already been brought by cycle couriers at CitySprint and Excel and drivers for taxi app Uber. All three cases found that the individuals concerned were workers, meaning that they were entitled to limited rights including holiday pay and the minimum wage, rather than self-employed contractors with no employment rights. How to speak Deliveroo The food delivery service has set out words and phrases that should and should not be used to describe its riders and their working practices. The company also provides handy example sentences: Do say: Independent supplier, eg: \u201cWe offer riders hours of work and they choose how many to accept based on their availability and the areas they want to work in.\u201d Don\u2019t say: Employee/worker/staff member/team member. eg \u201cDrivers are employed by Deliveroo to complete deliveries.\u201d Do say: Onboarding, eg: \u201cBefore working with us, riders complete a programme of app demonstration, safety guidance and documentation checks\u201d Don\u2019t say: Hiring. \u201cBefore their first shift drivers must complete a trial session\u201d Do say: Supply centre Don\u2019t say: Hiring office/hiring centre Do say: Supplier agreement, eg: \u201cYour supplier agreement may be terminated if you continue to fail to meet the service delivery standards.\u201d Don\u2019t say: Employment contract, eg: \u201cYou are obliged by your employment contract to hit certain performance targets.\u201d Do say: Working with Deliveroo, eg: \u201cWhile you are working with Deliveroo as an independent supplier, we would typically expect you to accept 95% of orders you are available to perform when logged in.\u201d Don\u2019t say: Working for Deliveroo, eg: \u201cOur drivers work for Deliveroo.\u201d Do say: Riders choosing an area of work, eg: \u201cRiders choose to work with us in localised areas to enable them to complete orders safely within time estimate.\u201d Don\u2019t say: Assigning riders to a zone, eg: \u201cDrivers are assigned to their zone based on where we need them most.\u201d Do say: Kit/equipment/branded clothing, eg: \u201cIf you purchased an equipment pack when you started working with Deliveroo, please bring it back to the supply centre, where we will repurchase it from you.\u201d Don\u2019t say: Uniform, eg \u201cPlease return the uniform you were issued with to the hiring office and we will refund your deposit.\u201d Do say: Availability, eg \u201cPlease indicate your availability via Staffomatic.\u201d Don\u2019t say: Shifts/sessions/hours, eg \u201cWe schedule riders\u2019 shifts in Staffomatic.\u201d Do say: Unavailability notification, eg \u201cIf you are unavailable for work for a prolonged period of time/at a previously agreed time, please let us know.\u201d Don\u2019t say: Absence request/booking a holiday/asking for time off, eg \u201cIf you want time off, you must book a holiday.\u201d Do say: Inactivity, eg \u201cAccording to the system, your rider app has been inactive since ... \u201d Don\u2019t say: Awol/unexplained absence, eg \u201cAccording to the system you have been absent for ... \u201d Do say: Logging in.

While number-crunching for Morgan Stanley on Wall Street, Will Shu and his colleagues were able to spend their $25 dinner allowance on food delivered by local restaurants. But when he transferred to the bank\u2019s London office, he found it much tougher to get nice restaurants to deliver. Shu, who was born in Connecticut to Chinese parents, returned to the US to do an MBA. Then he teamed up with his childhood friend Greg Orlowski, who had been working as a software engineer, to launch Deliveroo in early 2013. It began with just three restaurants on its books, including the one Shu lived above on the King\u2019s Road in London\u2019s Chelsea. The American made deliveries on his own scooter for the first eight months as a way of learning the business\u2019s complex logistics. While drivers complain of low pay, Deliveroo has raised close to $500m from investors to fund an international rollout. It now operates in over 140 cities across 12 countries, including Australia, Germany, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates. Shu\u2019s old scooter has now been sprayed gold and sits in Deliveroo\u2019s London offices.",

We ensure that employees know how to work with our partners, which includes training and guidelines to follow when talking to customers, restaurants, and of course self-employed riders.\u201d</p> <p>The dos and don\u2019ts document has emerged as several groups of gig-economy workers take legal action claiming the status of employees or workers, with more employment rights than self-employed contractors. They include a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/27/deliveroo-riders-plan-legal-action-over-employment-rights\"> group of Deliveroo couriers planning action against the food delivery firm</a> claiming better employment rights including the minimum wage, sick pay and holiday.

Their movements are also closely monitored by Deliveroo and subject to performance review.</p> <p>All of this terminology falls under the \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d column in the Deliveroo document seen by the Guardian \u2013 with alternative wording supplied. It appears to indicate that language is a key factor in separating the definition of a self-employed contractor and an employee at Deliveroo.</p> <p>The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain is also fighting for the right of union recognition at Deliveroo in Camden and Kentish Town, London.

    "webTitle": "Thousands of Tesco jobs at risk under plan to axe some night shifts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco is cutting night shifts for shelf stackers in some of its biggest supermarkets in a fresh shakeup that puts 3,000 jobs at risk. The UK\u2019s biggest retailer said the consultation process with night workers in the 69 impacted stores would begin this summer. As part of the changes, eight stores will stop trading round the clock, while other roles will be eliminated by plans to merge customer service counters with lottery and tobacco kiosks. Tesco expects the majority of staff affected to stay on, though night workers, who are paid more for working unsociable hours, could experience a drop in earnings if they do. Dave Lewis, the chief executive, who earned the nickname \u201cdrastic Dave\u201d after cutting jobs when he worked at Unilever, has eliminated more than 10,000 jobs at Tesco since being parachuted in to lead a turnaround of the business in 2014. The latest changes are part of a cost-cutting drive designed to improve the efficiency of Tesco stores before its controversial \u00a33.7bn takeover of Booker, the cash and carry company behind the Londis and Budgens convenience store chains. Tesco UK\u2019s chief executive said the changes meant stores could be run more simply and were in keeping with its goal to improve customer service. \u201cWe appreciate these changes will impact the roles of some of our colleagues and we will work with them to ensure they are fully supported throughout this period,\u201d Matt Davies said. Bricks-and-mortar retailers are having to rethink their business models in the face of aggressive online competitors as well as higher costs after this month\u2019s hike in the national living wage from \u00a37.20 to \u00a37.50 and the recent business rate changes. This year Waitrose said 700 staff were impacted by the closure of six stores and it planned to streamline store management. Its sister chain John Lewis announced it was axing nearly 800 jobs in its customer restaurants and store administration. Lewis took the helm at Tesco after a string of profit warnings under his predecessor, Philip Clarke. But the discovery of accounting irregularities forced him to embark on an overhaul of the business, including the disposal of its South Korean chain Homeplus for \u00a34bn. Last week Tesco agreed to pay \u00a3235m to settle investigations by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and Financial Conduct Authority into the accounting scandal. It will pay a \u00a3129m fine as part of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the SFO, though this deal requires court approval. The DPA relates to Tesco subsidiary Tesco Stores Ltd. The supermarket has also agreed to pay \u00a385m in compensation to investors affected by the window when there was a false market for its shares. After the accounting scandal Lewis led a restructuring of the group, which is the UK\u2019s biggest private sector employer. In his first year in charge he axed nearly 5,000 head office and UK store management jobs as well as more than 4,000 roles overseas and at the group\u2019s banking division. A further 2,500 jobs were lost with the closure of 43 underperforming Tesco stores. The retailer has been reviewing its store operations for some time and last year carried out a similar exercise with 2,000 workers affected when it dropped the night shift in 46 stores, with 20 ceasing round-the-clock trading. In February, Tesco also axed a layer of management in its smallest Express stores. It involved 1,700 deputy managers being replaced with 3,300 lower-paid \u201cshift leaders\u201d. The closure of two distribution centres at the start of the year also led to the loss of about 500 jobs. Lewis is expected to face tough questions about the merits of the Booker deal when the company reports its annual results next week after two major shareholders revealed their opposition to the deal. Schroders and Artisan Partners, which between them own 9% of the company, have written separately to the Tesco chairman, John Allan, to ask him to pull out of the deal. Berstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said the broker\u2019s poll of investors found support for the deal among Tesco and Booker shareholders was \u201chigh but not overwhelming\u201d. \u201cWe estimate based on the survey that the deal today would be approved by 70% of votes cast,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Schroders and Artisan want to block the deal, it will be hard but not unsurmountable. There are sufficient large holders that haven\u2019t disclosed their view that could sway this estimate.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Wall Street may be bouncing higher in the wake of better than expected jobs data, but the picture was more mixed in Europe. US investors shrugged off concerns about President Trump\u2019s meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, while the ADP employment data suggested a better than expected outcome from Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers. In the UK, the FTSE 100 moved ahead but the German and French markets fell back. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 9.86 points or 0.13% at 7331.68 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.53% to 12,217.54 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.18% at 5091.85 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged 0.02% lower to 20,253.37 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.4% higher at 10,402.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.53% to 669.97 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 152 points or 0.74%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. UK interest rates could start to rise in the second quarter of next year despite continuing uncertainty over the outlook for the country\u2019s economy, says Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics: Market expectations for the future path of UK interest rates have continued to nudge lower in recent days in response to evidence that the economy\u2019s growth rate has slowed a bit in the first quarter and some dovish noises from policymakers...The implied timing of the first 25bp hike in rates \u2013 derived from overnight indexed swaps (OIS) \u2013 has shifted back from late 2018 earlier in the month to the middle of 2019. This has pushed 10-year gilt yields down to six-month lows of just above 1%. As MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe stressed on Wednesday, there certainly are some good reasons for the MPC to tread cautiously. While the economy has proved resilient to the vote for Brexit, the outlook is very uncertain and there are signs that growth has started to slow as higher inflation pinches households\u2019 spending power. Meanwhile there are few signs as yet that the inflationary effects of the post-referendum drop in the pound are feeding through into broader price pressures. There is also a danger that a premature policy tightening would push the pound sharply higher and hence halt the rebalancing of the economy towards the external sector. But we think the markets have gone too far in pushing rate hikes out beyond next year. After all, the current unprecedentedly loose policy stance was initiated to prevent the 2008 recession from turning into a 1930s style depression and enhanced to mitigate the expected damage from of the vote for Brexit. Yet with depression risks having long receded, there is a strong case for scaling back the emergency stimulus. This case will become clearer if, as we expect, the economy continues to confound the worst fears of the impact of Brexit. Accordingly, our central forecast is now for Bank Rate to start to rise in the second quarter of next year and then climb to about 1.25% by the end of 2019. ..This would be an earlier and rather faster rise than the markets and most forecasters are anticipating. We would stress that such a path for interest rates would primarily reflect a fairly healthy economy rather than serious inflation worries. Nonetheless, it is likely to put at least some upward pressure on gilt yields. We forecast the 10-year yield to rise to 1.5% by the end of this year and to 2.5% by the end of next year. US crude stocks unexpectedly rose last week, taking some of the shine off oil prices. Crude inventories rose by 1.6m barrels to 535.5m, according to the Energy Information Administration, compared to expectations of a 100,000 decline. Brent, which had been as high at $55 a barrel earlier, lost some of its gains and is currently at $54.32, still up 0.28% on the day. In the current US market resurgence, the Nasdaq Composite has just hit a new record high of 5929, two days after the previous one. Despite the slightly disappointing service sector figures, Wall Street has continued its positive mood, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up around 180 points. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Mixed signals from the US economy couldn\u2019t prevent the Dow Jones from finally bursting back into life this afternoon. Having been trapped between 20600 and 20700 for the past fortnight the Dow awoke from its slumber in style this Wednesday, rising 180 points to hit its highest level since the first Trump healthcare doubts entered the market on March 21. It helped that the dollar was fairly quiet after the bell; though it took 0.6% off the Japanese yen, it made minimal headway against the euro and lost 0.3% against sterling. The thrust of the Dow\u2019s gains seemed to stem from the ADP non-farm reading, which vastly outperformed expectations at 263k against the 184k (February\u2019s figure, on the other hand, was revised from an extraordinary 298k to a more reasonable 245k). To maintain its gains the US index did have to ignore some concerning services PMIs, however; the Markit reading slipped to 52.8 from the initial 52.9 estimate, while the ISM figure plunged to a 5 month low of 55.2. And here is more detail on what the ISM respondents have been saying: \u201cGrowth on [a] number of projects has slowed a little, but revenue projections are steady.\u201d (Construction) \u201cThe details of the revisions to the Obamacare program are of great interest to us. There is a large amount of future uncertainty with what will happen. Meanwhile, the business continues.\u201d (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u201cHealth care changes can affect our business. Uncertainty is making us hold on many projects.\u201d (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u201cMarket conditions are still favorable with animal proteins due to [the] strong dollar, low exports and [an] abundant supply. Unknown [are] the POTUS\u2019 policies going forward on trade and immigration. Worker shortages have become a real problem in food production and produce growing areas.\u201d (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u201cBusiness is picking up. Service labor is tight. New legislation has had significant impact.\u201d (Public Administration) \u201cOverall, business conditions are favorable, and the outlook is positive.\u201d (Retail Trade) \u201cContinued optimism regarding the domestic business environment.\u201d (Management of Companies &amp; Support Services) \u201cFirst quarter has been brisk, and March has been as busy as I [have] ever seen, with many new endeavors.\u201d (Utilities) Despite the ISM figures coming in shy of expectations, they still show an economy heading in the right direction (any reading above 50 indicates expansion). The Institute said: The majority of respondents\u2019 comments indicate a positive outlook on business conditions and the overall economy. There were several comments about the uncertainty of future government policies on health care, trade and immigration, and the potential impact on business. The other US services survey has also fallen short of expectations. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s non-manufacturing PMI came in at 55.2 in March, below forecasts of 57 and down on the 57.6 figure in February. This is the lowest level since October last year. And here is the first US service sector report, and it is slightly disappointing. Markit\u2019s final service sector PMI index for March came in at 52.8, down from an initial estimate of 52.9 and the 53.8 recorded in February. The Markit composite index of services and manufacturing was 53 compared to the early reading of 53.2 and February\u2019s 54.1. Ahead of two separate snapshots of the US service sector and following better than expected jobs numbers, American stock markets are heading higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 88 points or 0.43% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.33% higher and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.23%. US markets had been undermined recently by concerns that President Trump\u2019s proposed tax and spending reforms could be stymied in the wake of his healthcare defeat. On the jobs data, which comes ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers, David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: ADP came in at 263,000 \u2013 miles above the 180,000 expected. The ADP number isn\u2019t a good predictor of the actual non-farm payroll number. However, it can give a \u201cheads-up\u201d for a big surprise, up or down. So today\u2019s reading suggests we should get a strong reading on Friday. Despite a long run of strong jobs numbers there are some concerns that US economic growth isn\u2019t as robust as it should be. Survey data such as Consumer Confidence, ISM Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs may be robust, but \u201chard data\u201d (with the exception of employment numbers) like Durable Goods, Retail Sales, Construction Spending, Vehicle Sales and Factory Orders have all disappointed recently. This is happening as the Fed proceeds to tighten monetary policy and even hints of starting to wind down its balance sheet later this year. One of the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate-setters has warned that the consumer slowdown in the UK will \u2018intensify\u2019 this year. Dr Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, told an audience in the City that subdued wage growth, and the inflationary impact of the weaker pound, will hit household budgets. Vlieghe says: The consumer slowdown, which initially did not materialise, now appears to be underway. Given the hit to real income from a mix of subdued wage growth and rising inflation, I think the slowdown is more likely to intensify than fade away. That fits with this morning\u2019s report on the service sector, which showed that companies dependent on consumer spending, such as hotels and gyms, were lagging behind the rest of the sector. He also produced this graph, showing how retail sales have weakened in recent months: And this graph, showing how real wages (in red) are expected to hit almost zero as inflation erodes incomes. Vlieghe also fears that business investment, which has been stronger than feared since the Brexit vote, could fall as Britain\u2019s exit from the EU approaches. He argues: It is possible that the absence of a sharp reaction was due to the fact that firms have generally taken a benign view of the impact on their business of possible future changes in the UK-EU relationship. It is also possible that uncertainty about these changes is substantial, but the changes have been too far away to have a marked effect spending decisions so far. As the time horizon now shortens, a more material reaction of spending in response to uncertainty might still occur. Much will depend on the detail of the final agreement, which might not be known until late in the negotiations. The full speech (which also compares economist forecasting to a doctor trying to predict a heart attack) is online here: Good policy vs accurate forecasts There are important developments in Greece today too, as European Council president Donald Tusk visits Athens. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has upped the ante, calling for an emergency meeting of EU leaders if tortuous negotiations over the country\u2019s bailout programme do not end soon. From Athens, our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Exploiting the opportunity of a visit by European council president Donald Tusk to Athens, the Greek leader said EU leaders should meet later this month if euro area finance ministers failed to agree on the country\u2019s economic progress on Friday. Ratcheting up the rhetoric, Tsipras said political leaders might have to wade in to stop what he described as \u201cendless\u201d negotiations with international creditors over Greece\u2019s latest compliance review. \u201cI think the initiative will have to be taken at the higher level to have a positive outcome before Easter, in any case, within April, even if this means calling a euro area summit,\u201d he told reporters after holding talks with Tusk. \u201cBut this endless negotiation must come to an end.\u201d The review is key to Greece being given further bailout funds to repay \u20ac7.5bn in maturing debt in July - or confront the prospect of default and euro exit. Tsipras made the remarks as negotiations between Athens and creditors hit fresh snags in Brussels late Tuesday where the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos had flown to try and break the deadlock before Friday\u2019s euro group. The leftist-led government, facing criticism for failing to conclude the review \u2013 but also mounting pressure on the street \u2013 is at odds over demands for further pension cuts, tax hikes and labour market reforms. Tsipras claimed that every time Greece was close to an agreement its lenders would call for further measures, adding: \u201cSome people are trying to hurt our recovery and bring a negative scenario back to the table for Greece and Europe during a sensitive time,\u201d Athens had placed great hopes in Tusk\u2019s visit. Attempting to sound a note of optimism, the former Polish prime minister insisted it was expedient the impasse was broken when the euro group convenes on Friday in Malta. \u201cOur finance ministers should do the work to achieve an agreement,\u201d said Tusk who played a prominent role in bringing the country back from the brink when it came closest yet to exiting the euro in mid-2015. He added: \u201cThis is the only positive result for Greece and for the whole [EU] community. \u201cThere is no political and substantial alternative. Newsflash: America\u2019s companies created many more jobs than expected last month. The monthly ADP report shows that the US private sector created 263,000 new jobs in March, more more than the 185,000 which Wall Street expected. It\u2019s another signal that the US labour market is strong, and could indicate that Friday\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll report will beat expectations. However.... ADP have also revised down their figures from February, from 298,000 to 245,000. And here\u2019s economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s UK productivity figures: Here\u2019s our news story about March\u2019s record-breaking UK car sales figures: We have more car news....but this time, it\u2019s about strike action not rising sales. British workers at BMW are to hold eight strikes over the next few weeks to oppose plans by the carmaker to close their final salary pensions, and move workers onto a less generous package. It will begin in April 19 with a walkout at BMW\u2019s Mini plant in Oxford, its engine facility near Birmingham, and a factory in Swindon. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey says: \u201cBMW\u2019s refusal to talk about affordable options to keep the pension scheme open means a sizable chunk of its UK workforce will be taking strike action for the first time in the coming weeks. \u201cBosses in the UK and BMW\u2019s headquarters in Munich cannot feign surprise that it\u2019s come to this point. Unite has repeatedly warned of the anger their insistence to railroad through the pension scheme\u2019s closure would generate and the resulting industrial action. In other news, UK productivity has crept higher, but is still much lower than in other G7 countries. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show that economic output per hour rose by 0.4% in October-December, up from 0.2% in July-September. It\u2019s a sign that the economy was more productive at the end of 2016. However, productivity has still failed to recover from the financial crisis, if you compare recent figures to the trend before 2008. The ONS also reports that wages grew faster than productivity in the quarter -- something that might make the Bank of England worry. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First, fears that the UK economy is entering choppier water. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s service sector report: \u201cWhile the headline index number may have rebounded from a 5 month low in February, there is little to be enamoured with in this reading of the UK\u2019s most important sector; consumers are under pressure, services sector companies that cater to them are weaker and margins are likely being pressured further. Average prices are at the highest level in 8.5 years and whilst some consumer resilience is allowing some of this to be passed on in higher prices on the shelves we have to think that that consumer resilience will give way before the business need to keep prices raised does. In the short term, this means a turning of the screw for the man in the street and a poor outlook for High St profits. This sector makes up the majority of the UK economy and the prognosis is poor.\u201d Neil Wilson of ETX Capital is concerned that consumer-focused companies lagged behind in March: Activity rose to its best level in three months and was a very strong rebound from the five-month low of February. Prices are rising \u2013 largely due to input inflation \u2013 while job creation has slowed a little. Financial services was most resilient sector while consumer-oriented sectors struggled \u2013 evidence that chimes with data suggesting consumers might be about to pull back on some discretionary spending as inflation squeezes incomes. Inflation is overtaking wages and that means one thing \u2013 lower aggregate demand. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank agrees with Markit\u2019s prediction that UK growth slowed to 0.4% in the last quarter (and even provides a graph to back it up) The key point is that the UK continues to enjoy a broad based expansion in output, and we strongly expect it to continue. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight also fears a slowdown this year, as rising inflation hurts consumers. Services activity has been particularly led by the consumer-facing sectors. Looking ahead, we suspect that consumer services activity will be increasingly pressurized by consumers\u2019 purchasing power weakening over the coming months as inflation rises appreciably and earnings growth is muted. This is likely to cause some consumers to cut back on their discretionary spending, including on services. \u2018Services\u2019 is a broad measure, covering around four-fifths of the UK economy. And today\u2019s report shows that consumer-focused sectors had a tough March, while the City powered on. Markit says: Within the service sector, the worst performance so far this year has been seen in consumer- oriented sectors, notably hotels and restaurants, as well as personal consumer services (which include businesses such as sports centres, gyms and hairdressers). The greatest resilience has been seen in financial services. Economists Rupert Seggins has helpfully tweeted more details of the PMI reports: undefined The news that Britain\u2019s service sector grew faster than expected in March has boosted the pound. Sterling jumped by half a cent against the US dollar to $1.248, as traders welcomed the pick-up in activity in Britain\u2019s dominant sector. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, says: \u201cToday\u2019s services PMI figure has bucked the trend of weak data seen on Monday and Tuesday, paving the way for the pound to make its long-awaited recovery. \u201cDespite underwhelming manufacturing and construction data, the services sector is a key component of the UK economy and today\u2019s number is very encouraging.\u201d Despite beating forecasts, March\u2019s UK PMI report does include some worrying signs. For starters, UK service sector firms created fewer new jobs than in February, with new hiring hitting its slowest pace since August 2016. Markit says this left some firms struggling to get their work done. A combination of rising workloads and softer employment growth contributed to a renewed accumulation of backlogs across the service economy. Some firms noted that squeezed margins and rising wage bills had led to the non- replacement of voluntary leavers. Secondly, firms hiked their prices at their fastest pace in eight and a half-years. This was overwhelmingly linked to higher input costs during recent months. Survey respondents also noted that resilient demand had provided scope to pass on some of their increased costs to clients Breaking: Britain\u2019s service sector has posted its strongest growth of the year, after suffering a slowdown over the winter. Data firm IHS Markit reports that business activity growth hit a three-month high in March, driven by a pick-up in new work. Bosses interviewed for the survey said they are optimistic about prospects over the next year --almost half forecast growth while only one-in-nine expect a fall in activity. Some companies said that \u201cBrexit-related uncertainty\u201d was holding back investment decisions. But on the upside, some firms are seeing more demand from abroad thanks to the weak pound. This drove the Services PMI up from 53.3 to 55.0 - the highest reading since December 2016. The PMI has now been over 50 points (the level between expansion and contraction) for eight months. Encouraging stuff. But Markit also predicts that the wider UK economy has probably slowed in the last quarter. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, explains: \u201cThe survey data indicate that UK business activity growth regained some momentum after having slipped to a five-month low in February, but the upturn fails to change the picture of an economy that slowed in the first quarter. \u201cThe relative weakness of the PMI survey data compared to that seen at the turn of the year suggests the economy will have grown by 0.4% in the first quarter, markedly lower than the 0.7% expansion seen in the fourth quarter of last year. \u201cMuch of the disappointment in growth so far this year has been evident in consumer-oriented sectors, in part linked to spending and incomes being squeezed by higher prices. Wow! Britain\u2019s car market has just enjoyed its strongest month ever. Car registrations surged by 8.4% year-on-year in March, to 562,337, according to new figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). That smashes all records going back to the 1976, beating the previous record in August 1997. The blowout figures were partly driven by a rush to buy cars before vehicle tax changes kicked in this month. This new Vehicle Excise Duty regime pushes up the annual tax bill for more expensive cars, and those which emit more CO2 than average. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, explains: This bumper performance probably means we will see a slowdown in April, exacerbated by the fact there are fewer selling days this year given Easter timing. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we still expect the market to cool only slightly given broader political uncertainties as there are still attractive deals on offer.\u201d As usual, Ford cars were the most popular: Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi flags up how the eurozone had a good quarter: Boom! The eurozone\u2019s private sector has posted its best quarter since the start of the financial crisis. Data firm Markit reports that Eurozone output and new order growth accelerated to near six-year records in March. That drove its service sector PMI up to 56.0, up from 55.5, and the \u2018composite PMI\u2019 (which also includes manufacturing data) up to 56.4. The report found that: March saw the strongest inflows of new business into the eurozone economy since April 2011. Employment growth was the sharpest in over nine- and-a-half years. Price pressures remained strong in March. Input cost inflation was close to February\u2019s 69-month record, reflecting rising global commodity prices and the historically weak euro exchange rate. Business optimism rose to a fresh series-record high, improving at service providers and remaining relatively elevated at manufacturers too. Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson says the report signals an \u201cimpressive\u201d rate of economic growth: \u201cThis is a broad-based upturn among the euro\u2019s largest members, with 0.6% growth signalled for both Germany and France, while Spain looks set to have enjoyed 0.8-0.9% growth in the first quarter, according to the PMI data. Growth has also perked up in Italy during the first quarter despite a slight pull-back in March, with the surveys indicating a 0.3-0.4% expansion. \u201cMost welcome for a region still suffering near- double digit unemployment is a rise in the survey\u2019s employment index to its highest for almost a decade, suggesting we should expect to see the jobless rate fall further in coming months. Another good month for Germany: We have good news from France; its private sector has posted its fastest growth in 70 months. Italy\u2019s services sector has slowed a little, with its PMI dipping to 52.9, from 54.1 European markets are muted this morning, as investors digest the news that North Korea fired a ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan overnight. That missile test appears to be a defiant signal from Pyongyang ahead of the US-China summit later this week, where North Korea will be high on the agenda. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: Keeping the peace in Asia is just another item on the agenda which will be important for both leaders to talk about. North Korea tested another missile last night and this has increased tensions over in Asia. This will also add another dimension to President Trump and President Xi\u2019s meeting. The US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, has already made the US\u2019 position clear by signalling that the US will not tolerate such activities. So the FTSE 100 has climbed by 20-odd points, but other European markets are down a little. Zing! The second first healthcheck on the eurozone has arrived, and it\u2019s a belter. The Spanish service sector PMI has beaten expectations by hitting 57.4, close to February\u2019s 18-month high of 57.7. Spanish firms reported a rise in new orders, and better market conditions. This encouraged them to take on more staff, which is great news given Spain\u2019s persistent unemployment problem. But many companies also said they hiked prices, passing on higher costs to customers. Markit says: In response to rising input costs, companies increased their output prices. Moreover, the rate of charge inflation accelerated to the fastest since July 2007. Four of the six monitored sectors saw output prices rise, led by Post &amp; Telecommunications. The Financial Services and Hotels &amp; Restaurants categories were the only two to post declines. March was a very kind month for the Swedish economy. The Swedish service sector PMI has bounded up to 61.3, from 59.8 -- a rather high reading, and well into expansion territory. That follows very solid manufacturing figures on Monday, which showed the fastest growth in seven years. Ireland\u2019s service sector has recorded another strong month, although growth did slow slightly. The Irish Services PMI has dipped to 59.1 in March from 60.6 in February. That\u2019s the weakest reading of 2017, but still showing a solid expansion. Investec, which compiles the survey, says: The increase was recorded amid greater volumes of new work and reports of an improved economic environment. Overnight, we\u2019ve learned that Japan\u2019s service sector grew at its fastest pace in 19 months in March. The Japanese services PMI rose to 52.9, up from 51.3, helped by a rise in business confidence. That suggests that the country\u2019s economy strengthened last month, says Paul Smith, senior economist at IHS Markit: Growth is broad-based. Both the manufacturing and service sectors are enjoying upturns, supported by firm demand for goods and services. With capacity pressures subsequently intensifying, this is having a positive spillover into the labour market. Jobs continued to be added at a solid pace in March. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s service sector makes up almost 80% of the economy, from financial firms in the City of London to restaurants and tourist attractions around the country. So today\u2019s healthcheck on the service sector should give a good insight into how the economy fared last month. The Service sector PMI, produced by data firm Markit, lands at 9.30am GMT - and it expected to show steady growth last month. City economists predict that the PMI will increase from 53.5, from 53.3 in February -- meaning growth accelerated at a faster rate last month. That would be a good sign for economic growth in the first three months of 2017. But after weaker-than-expected figures from manufacturing and construction companies this week, a disappointing reading can\u2019t be ruled out. Markit are also publishing service sector reports from across the eurozone this morning. That\u2019s likely to show a solid rise in activity in March, as the eurozone recovery continues. But RBC Capital warns: We expect some weakening in the March services PMIs for Spain and Italy today. Also coming up today Gertjan Vlieghe, one of the Bank of England policymakers who set interest rates, is giving a speech at 1.30pm BST. Vlieghe is one of the more dovish members of the Monetary Policy Committee, so investors will be listening out for any comments on interest rates. Investors are getting edgier about the summit meeting between presidents Trump and Xi later this week. The Chinese premier is in Helsinki today, on a trip to build closer economic and political ties with Finland; we might get some comments from Xi on the importance of free trade (an issue he highlighted at Davos back in January). Former Finnish prime minister Alex Stubb is tweeting about the visit: On the economics calendar, we get the latest UK car sales figures at 9am BST. Then at 1.15pm BST the latest US ADP employment figures are released, showing how many new jobs were created by American companies last month. That will set the scene for Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll report (the wider measure of US employment). European stock markets are expected to open a little higher.",

While the economy has proved resilient to the vote for Brexit, the outlook is very uncertain and there are signs that growth has started to slow as higher inflation pinches households\u2019 spending power. Meanwhile there are few signs as yet that the inflationary effects of the post-referendum drop in the pound are feeding through into broader price pressures. There is also a danger that a premature policy tightening would push the pound sharply higher and hence halt the rebalancing of the economy towards the external sector.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0914d89358ca8d59d5e234d2583248b9f0204197\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0914d89358ca8d59d5e234d2583248b9f0204197/0_91_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bank of England\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bank of England</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>But we think the markets have gone too far in pushing rate hikes out beyond next year. After all, the current unprecedentedly loose policy stance was initiated to prevent the 2008 recession from turning into a 1930s style depression and enhanced to mitigate the expected damage from of the vote for Brexit. Yet with depression risks having long receded, there is a strong case for scaling back the emergency stimulus. This case will become clearer if, as we expect, the economy continues to confound the worst fears of the impact of Brexit.</p> <p>Accordingly, our central forecast is now for Bank Rate to start to rise in the second quarter of next year and then climb to about 1.25% by the end of 2019. ..This would be an earlier and rather faster rise than the markets and most forecasters are anticipating. We would stress that such a path for interest rates would primarily reflect a fairly healthy economy rather than serious inflation worries. Nonetheless, it is likely to put at least some upward pressure on gilt yields. We forecast the 10-year yield to rise to 1.5% by the end of this year and to 2.5% by the end of next year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58e50630e4b05776df18add9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-05T15:03:11.446Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US crude stocks in surprise increase</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>US crude stocks unexpectedly rose last week, taking some of the shine off oil prices.</strong></p> <p>Crude inventories rose by 1.6m barrels to 535.5m, according to the Energy Information Administration, compared to expectations of a 100,000 decline.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "New car sales in the UK hit an all-time high last month, with more than half a million vehicles registered, including a record number of diesel models. A total of 562,337 new cars took to the roads in March as sales of new cars rose 8.4% from a year earlier. It was the biggest month since the Society of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders started collecting data in 1976. This was more than double the number in the first two months of the year combined, driving registrations for the first three months of the year up 6.2% to 820,016 \u2013 a record quarter. March is traditionally a popular month for new cars due to the introduction of new registrations. However, last month buyers also rushed to buy cars before new vehicle excise duty rates come into force. From 1 April all new cars, apart from those with zero emissions, have to pay an annual flat rate charge. A total of 244,263 diesel cars were sold in March, a record, but there was also some evidence that the controversy surrounding emissions and the damage these vehicles are causing to the environment is starting to hit demand. Diesel was the slowest-growing segment of the new car market, with sales up 1.6% year-on-year compared to 13.2% for petrol and 31% for alternatively-fuelled cars, such as electric vehicles. This meant that diesel\u2019s share of the new car market fell from 46.4% to 43.4%, while petrol rose from 50.3% to 52.5%. In 2010 diesel cars became more popular than petrol for the first time, but that trend has now reversed. Sales of diesel cars have hit record levels despite governments around the world exploring ways to get them off the road. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, plans to increase the amount that diesel cars pay to enter central London, while earlier this week Sir David King, the chief scientific adviser under both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, admitted the government had been\u201cwrong\u201d to encourage people to buy diesel vehicles in the past. Industry experts said on Wednesday that car makers should be forced to recall and upgrade cars that emit higher levels of toxic pollution on the road than they did in official tests. The German and French governments have already demanded that manufacturers including Volkswagen, Opel, Audi, Mercedes and Renault fix more than a million diesel vehicles. Greg Archer, director of clean vehicles at NGO Transport &amp; Environment and a former UK government air pollution adviser, said: \u201cThe polluter should be paying, not the consumer and not the taxpayer. But the UK is doing nothing. If the car industry was required to recall those vehicles and upgrade the after-treatment system that would make a sizeable difference to the air pollution problems in our cities.\u201d \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t need to pay for a scrappage scheme. It is time for the [manufacturers] who caused the problem to pay for the problem.\u201d This solution is also backed by ClientEarth, the environmental law firm that has twice defeated ministers at the high court over the government\u2019s illegally poor air pollution plans. James Thornton, chief executive of ClientEarth, said: \u201cThe prime minister must get on the side of ordinary car drivers and stand up to the car industry by committing to a programme of mandatory vehicle recall, compensation, random on-road testing and a clean-car label based on real-world emissions.\u201d Analysts warned that the record-breaking performance for the UK car market in March could be a \u201clast hurrah\u201d. Consumers and businesses are expected to pull back spending as job growth weakens, the economy slows and higher inflation caused by the weak pound erodes the purchasing power of households. Howard Archer, the chief UK and European economist at IHS Markit, said: \u201cThere was clearly a considerable lift to sales coming from both consumers and businesses bringing forward car purchases before changes to vehicle excise duty were introduced in April. \u201cIt also looks odds-on that the squeeze on consumers\u2019 purchasing power will deepen appreciably further while businesses will face increasing challenging and uncertain conditions which may well cause them to be more circumspect in replacing their car fleets. \u201cThe suspicion has to be that the car sector will face an increasingly challenging year going forward.\u201d Demand from fleets and businesses was particularly strong, with registrations up 12.6% and 11.9% respectively in March. Sales to private buyers \u2013 consumers \u2013 rose 4.4%.",

Diesel was the slowest-growing segment of the new car market, with sales up 1.6% year-on-year compared to 13.2% for petrol and 31% for alternatively-fuelled cars, such as electric vehicles. This meant that diesel\u2019s share of the new car market fell from 46.4% to 43.4%, while petrol rose from 50.3% to 52.5%. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/05/diesel-car-sales-overtake-petrol\">In 2010 diesel cars became more popular than petrol for the first time</a>, but that trend has now reversed.</p> <p>Sales of diesel cars have hit record levels despite governments around the world exploring ways to get them off the road. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, plans to increase the amount that diesel cars pay to enter central London, while earlier this week Sir David King, the chief scientific adviser under both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, admitted the government had been\u201cwrong\u201d to encourage people to buy diesel vehicles in the past.</p> <p>Industry experts said on Wednesday that car makers should be forced to recall and upgrade cars that emit higher levels of toxic pollution on the road than they did in official tests. <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-emissions-germany-probe-idUKL5N17P2ZB\">The German</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-19/renault-will-recall-more-than-15-000-cars-on-emissions-issues\">French governments</a> have already demanded that manufacturers including Volkswagen, Opel, Audi, Mercedes and Renault fix more than a million diesel vehicles.</p> <p>Greg Archer, director of clean vehicles at NGO Transport &amp; Environment and a former UK government air pollution adviser, said: \u201cThe polluter should be paying, not the consumer and not the taxpayer. But the UK is doing nothing. If the car industry was required to recall those vehicles and upgrade the after-treatment system that would make a sizeable difference to the air pollution problems in our cities.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t need to pay for a scrappage scheme.

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is cutting 325 jobs and has revealed the location of the 100 branches it will close between July and October. Unite, Britain\u2019s biggest union, and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) expressed concern and anger. The reductions are part of a three-year cost-cutting programme being implemented by the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, to axe 12,000 jobs from the bank\u2019s 75,000-member workforce and close 400 branches this year. Lloyds said the 325 job losses were part of this cost-cutting plan and were related to the restructure of some management roles in the Lloyds Bank network. The net total includes 96 new roles. The latest closures affect 54 Lloyds branches, 22 Halifax branches and 24 Bank of Scotland outlets across the country. Once they are completed, Lloyds will be left with more than 1,800 branches across the three brands. Thousands of bank branches have closed across the country in recent years, and the FSB chairman, Mike Cherry, said: \u201cIt is very worrying to see yet more local bank branches being shut down, leaving small business customers without the services they rely on. Cash still remains an important element of many small firms and it needs to be banked at the end of the day.\u201d He said online banking was not always an option because of poor broadband coverage in many rural areas. While some banks allow basic services to be accessed in Post Office branches, they fall far short of full business services. \u201cThe onus is now on Lloyds to take steps to ensure access to banking is being protected under the terms of the access to banking protocol,\u201d he said. Lloyds said the branch closures were prompted by changing customer behaviour and the reduced number of transactions being made in branches. The bank expects to continue to have the biggest branch network in the UK. To cushion the blow, Lloyds has launched a fleet of mobile vans which will visit communities hit by the disappearance of high street outlets. It said on Wednesday it would add another nine vehicles to the fleet, taking the total to 20 by the end of 2017. Rob MacGregor, national officer of the Unite union, rejected Lloyds\u2019 argument that customers preferred to use technology to do their banking. He said: \u201cThe loss of a further 100 local banks will be painful for high streets across the country to absorb \u2026 It\u2019s clear that many customers still value the face to face engagement with experienced and knowledgeable bank staff. \u201cThe industry must halt these endless branch closure programmes and open their eyes to what these closures are doing to rural communities, their disabled customers and the small business customers who depend on access to a local branch.\u201d On Monday, Lloyds announced that it would shrink the size of hundreds of branches to \u201cmicro branches\u201d without counters, with only two staff with tablet computers assisting customers. The main high street players \u2013 Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander \u2013 have shut 1,7000 branches in the past five years, leaving 1,500 communities without a bank on their high street.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s services firms have bounced back from a new year lull to expand at the fastest rate since late 2016. The latest health check of a sector that accounts for more than 75% of the economy\u2019s output showed the pace of activity picking up to a three-month high in March. Despite evidence that higher inflation was taking its toll of spending in hotels, restaurants, gyms and hairdressers, exporters of services were boosted by the fall in the value of the pound. The monthly survey from Markit/CIPS showed business activity rising from a five-month low of 53.3 in February to 55 in March. Any reading above 50 indicates that the sector is expanding. The survey reported that new product launches, strong client demand and the boost from a recovering global economy had all helped the service sector in March. Demand from the US was notably strong. Chris Williamson, the chief economist at IHS Markit, said that the rebound in the service sector did not change the picture of an economy growing less rapidly in the first three months of 2017 than in the final quarter of 2016. \u201cThe relative weakness of the PMI survey data compared to that seen at the turn of the year suggests the economy will have grown by 0.4% in the first quarter, markedly lower than the 0.7% expansion seen in the fourth quarter of last year,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cMuch of the disappointment in growth so far this year has been evident in consumer-oriented sectors, in part linked to spending and incomes being squeezed by higher prices.\u201d The Markit/CIPS survey found some companies reporting Brexit-related uncertainty holding back investment decisions. Ruth Gregory, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said the service sector survey \u2013 taken together with similar reports for manufacturing and construction \u2013 pointed to the economy growing at 0.5% in the first quarter. \u201cMarch\u2019s strong UK Markit/CIPS report on services provides some reassurance that the economy won\u2019t slow too sharply this year, despite the intensifying headwinds,\u201d Gregory said. The Office for National Statistics will produce its first estimate of 2017 first quarter growth later this month.",

Even enlightened fund managers are sick of LTIPs and share the committee\u2019s view that \u201cLTIPs impact on incentivising performance is unproven at best, and, at worst, they can create perverse incentives and encourage short-term decision-making\u201d. What\u2019s stopping reform? Only the timidity of pay committees that cling to consensual thinking and what their consultants tell him. It is safer to carry on with a discredited system than design a better one and put it to a shareholder vote. The report from Iain Wright\u2019s select committee, let\u2019s hope, will now reverse that thinking. Alternative systems, such as issuing restricted stock to executives, may be imperfect \u2013 but they are better than LTIPs. Two other recommendations are also strong. Putting workers on remuneration committees would be an easy way to oblige non-executive directors to examine pay across their organisations, not just in the boardroom. The measure will be resisted, of course, but it hardly amounts to a revolution. Theresa May originally said she wanted workers\u2019 representatives in boardrooms but the committee\u2019s proposal falls well short of such radicalism. The prime minister could reflect that she has been offered an elegant fudge that carries the support of a cross-party committee of MPs. The mandatory publication of pay ratios would also encourage companies to take a wider view on pay and, since they have already the data, little extra work is required. The argument that pay ratios can be misleading (because an investment bank might appear to be a \u201cfairer\u201d employer than a supermarket) is a red herring. As the committee argues correctly, the useful information would be the change in the ratios over time at individual companies. It ought to be politically painless for the government to back the proposal. Abolition of LTIPs, however, will be the real test of seriousness. The evidence says LTIPs are distrusted, don\u2019t work within their own narrow logic and have grown like weeds.

    "webTitle": "Is there a housing bubble or isn't there? | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In the run-up to the May budget each year, the talk is often about tax cuts and welfare cuts, or general hubbub about the budget balance. This year a topic which is only of secondary importance to the budget balance is front and centre \u2013 housing affordability, and more crucially, whether or not Australia\u2019s property market is in a bubble. The problem with talk of housing bubbles is that it very much brings to the fore the issue of Australia\u2019s divergent economy. Sydney is not representative of the nation, but neither is Adelaide or Perth. Since the Reserve Bank of Australia began cutting rates in November 2011, the housing price boom has overwhelmingly been Sydney-centric. In December 2011, the median house price in Sydney was $533,000, only just ahead of Canberra\u2019s $500,000, Melbourne\u2019s $495,000, and not absurdly above the median price for houses in Perth of $480,000. But now the median house price in Sydney is just shy of $1m at $970,000, while the rest of the nation has been left in the dust. While the median house price in Melbourne and Canberra in that time has increased by what you would think is a pretty steep \u2013 36% and 30% respectively \u2013 that is nothing compared with the 82% increase in Sydney: Now housing prices going up \u2013 or even booming \u2013 does not mean we are necessarily experiencing a bubble. A bubble occurs when the increase in price is at a rate that is unsustainable and is also out of whack with the reality of the situation. Now that is not easy to pick; if it was easy, we wouldn\u2019t have them. But there are things we can look at with concern, and we know we should because the Reserve Bank is very much looking at them. The big one is debt. Housing prices and debt are joined at the hip. There aren\u2019t many people out there paying cash for a house. So if housing prices are going up, a good space to watch is whether the level of debt in the economy appears to be at levels that are unsustainable and/or out of step with other aspects of the economy. And here we look to the the governor of the RBA, Philip Lowe, who, in a speech on Tuesday night, made it pretty clear there are warning signs. He told the audience that \u201cthe level of household debt in Australia is high and it is rising\u201d. It sure is. The current level of household debt to disposable income is at a record 188.7%: Lowe noted that \u201cover the past year the value of housing-related debt outstanding increased by 6.5%\u201d and that because incomes have not risen by as much, there \u201chas been a further rise in the ratio of household debt to income, from an already high level\u201d. The final part is important. The rise in the level of household debt and housing debt over the past few years has been large, but not unprecedented: In the 1990s and early 2000s (before the global financial crisis), Australians gorged themselves on debt. When Australia exited the 1990s recession, our debt level was at 80% of disposable income. From there Australians would set off on a 15-year-run of increasing debt. By the time the GFC hit, the ratio was up to 171.1%. During the GFC and years that followed, we took a breather from our climb up the debt mountain. But once the RBA\u2019s cuts to interest rates began to fully take hold, we set off again at a furious pace. But while the growth of debt over the past three years is not too out of step with what we saw in the 1990s, and much less than during the super housing boom in the very early 2000s, the key, as Lowe noted, is that debt is at \u201can already high level\u201d. Increasing the level of debt in the economy is much different when it is just 80% of disposable income, than when it is 180%. The other major problem is that this increase is out of step with what is happening in the rest of the economy. Lowe noted that while Australians are generally coping well with their debt levels, \u201cat the same time, though, slow growth in wages is making it harder for some households to pay down their debt\u201d. In a line that rather goes to the heart of the problem, Lowe noted that \u201cfor many people, the high debt levels and low wage growth are a sobering combination\u201d. And if we compare the increase in the ratio of debt with the Australian Bureau of Statistics\u2019 measure of \u201cnational economic wellbeing\u201d \u2013 real net national disposable income \u2013 the recent increase in debt certainly looks out of whack: So we have strong rises in housing debt due to house prices going up \u2013 especially in Sydney and to a lesser extent in Melbourne \u2013 at a time that wages and income growth is weak. That is not a combination that is sustainable, and it is a combination that is worrying given we have record levels of debt. If we were to try to calm everyone about debt, we could say that, yes, debt-to-income is rising, but so too are asset values. The ratio of debt-to-asset values is well down on the record highs of three years ago: Partly this is because the price of houses (assets) has been rising faster than the level of debt, and because, with low interest rates, people are able to pay off the debt quicker. And while it is good that asset prices are rising faster than we are accumulating debt, that ratio only works so long as the asset prices keep rising and interest rates stay low. It can get ugly quickly if house prices fall, or interest rates start going up. Amid all this discussion has come focus on the supply of housing. Lowe mentioned this aspect, and the prime minister has been quick to echo his statement that \u201cit is hard to escape the conclusion that we need to address the supply side if we are to avoid ever-rising housing costs relative to our incomes\u201d. Within this debate has also been talk of population growth \u2013 especially that of migration. And yet migration figures are down from levels hit at the end of the mining boom, and even the recent peak of December 2012: And interestingly, there has also been in that time a supply boom \u2013 especially in apartments and flats: The boom in apartment construction came at a time when our migrant intake began to fall. So big has been the surge in apartment construction \u2013 especially in Melbourne and Brisbane \u2013 that the RBA is worried about an oversupply of such housing. And then there is the problem of bank-lending practices. Lowe told his audience he is worried that \u201ctoo many loans are still made where the borrower has the skinniest of income buffers after interest payments\u201d. He noted that \u201cin some cases, lenders are assuming that people can live more frugally than in practice they can, leaving little buffer if things go wrong\u201d. Right now, with record debt levels rising at a time when income growth is flat, apartment construction exploding while population growth is slowing, and all the while house prices in Sydney and Melbourne rising by nearly 20% in the past year, while banks are already starting to raise interest rates, it feels as though the market is at a point where it wouldn\u2019t take much for things to go very wrong indeed.",

Sydney is not representative of the nation, but neither is Adelaide or Perth.</p> <p>Since the Reserve Bank of Australia began cutting rates in November 2011, the housing price boom has overwhelmingly been Sydney-centric.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/04/reserve-bank-head-warns-house-price-speculation-is-a-risk-to-australian-economy\">Reserve Bank head warns house price speculation is a risk to Australian economy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In December 2011, the median house price in Sydney was $533,000, only just ahead of Canberra\u2019s $500,000, Melbourne\u2019s $495,000, and not absurdly above the median price for houses in Perth of $480,000.</p> <p>But now the median <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/03/sydney-property-prices-rise-almost-20-in-past-12-months\">house price in Sydney </a>is just shy of $1m at $970,000, while the rest of the nation has been left in the dust.</p> <p>While the median house price in Melbourne and Canberra in that time has increased by what you would think is a pretty steep \u2013 36% and 30% respectively \u2013 that is nothing compared with the 82% increase in Sydney:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Median house prices by capital city\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9xSB3/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> Now housing prices going up \u2013 or even booming \u2013 does not mean we are necessarily experiencing a bubble. A bubble occurs when the increase in price is at a rate that is unsustainable and is also out of whack with the reality of the situation.</p> <p>Now that is not easy to pick; if it was easy, we wouldn\u2019t have them. But there are things we can look at with concern, and we know we should because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/04/reserve-bank-head-warns-house-price-speculation-is-a-risk-to-australian-economy\">the Reserve Bank is very much looking at them.</a></p> <p>The big one is debt.</p> <p>Housing prices and debt are joined at the hip. There aren\u2019t many people out there paying cash for a house. So if housing prices are going up, a good space to watch is whether the level of debt in the economy appears to be at levels that are unsustainable and/or out of step with other aspects of the economy.</p> <p>And here we look to the the governor of the RBA, Philip Lowe, who, in a speech on <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2017/sp-gov-2017-04-04.html\">Tuesday night</a>, made it pretty clear there are warning signs. He told the audience that \u201cthe level of household debt in Australia is high and it is rising\u201d.</p> <p>It sure is. The current level of household debt to disposable income is at a record 188.7%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Ratio of household debt to disposable income\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YdRKO/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> Lowe noted that \u201cover the past year the value of housing-related debt outstanding increased by 6.5%\u201d and that because incomes have not risen by as much, there \u201chas been a further rise in the ratio of household debt to income, from an already high level\u201d.</p> <p>The final part is important.</p> <p>The rise in the level of household debt and housing debt over the past few years has been large, but not unprecedented:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Three year growth of household debt to income ratio\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IaF9J/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> In the 1990s and early 2000s (before the global financial crisis), Australians gorged themselves on debt.</p> <p>When Australia exited the 1990s recession, our debt level was at 80% of disposable income. From there Australians would set off on a 15-year-run of increasing debt. By the time the GFC hit, the ratio was up to 171.1%.</p> <p>During the GFC and years that followed, we took a breather from our climb up the debt mountain. But once the RBA\u2019s cuts to interest rates began to fully take hold, we set off again at a furious pace.</p> <p>But while the growth of debt over the past three years is not too out of step with what we saw in the 1990s, and much less than during the super housing boom in the very early 2000s, the key, as Lowe noted, is that debt is at \u201can already high level\u201d.</p> <p>Increasing the level of debt in the economy is much different when it is just 80% of disposable income, than when it is 180%. The other major problem is that this increase is out of step with what is happening in the rest of the economy.</p> <p>Lowe noted that while Australians are generally coping well with their debt levels, \u201cat the same time, though, slow growth in wages is making it harder for some households to pay down their debt\u201d.</p> <p>In a line that rather goes to the heart of the problem, Lowe noted that \u201cfor many people, the high debt levels and low wage growth are a sobering combination\u201d.</p> <p>And if we compare the increase in the ratio of debt with the Australian Bureau of Statistics\u2019 measure of \u201cnational economic wellbeing\u201d \u2013 real net national disposable income \u2013 the recent increase in debt certainly looks out of whack:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Three year growth of economic wellbeing and housing debt\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oWf0h/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> So we have strong rises in housing debt due to house prices going up \u2013 especially in Sydney and to a lesser extent in Melbourne \u2013 at a time that wages and income growth is weak.</p> <p>That is not a combination that is sustainable, and it is a combination that is worrying given we have record levels of debt.</p> <p>If we were to try to calm everyone about debt, we could say that, yes, debt-to-income is rising, but so too are asset values. The ratio of debt-to-asset values is well down on the record highs of three years ago:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Ratio of housing debt to assets\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QpEGc/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> Partly this is because the price of houses (assets) has been rising faster than the level of debt, and because, with low interest rates, people are able to pay off the debt quicker.</p> <p>And while it is good that asset prices are rising faster than we are accumulating debt, that ratio only works so long as the asset prices keep rising and interest rates stay low. It can get ugly quickly if house prices fall, or interest rates start going up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/03/sydney-property-prices-rise-almost-20-in-past-12-months\">Sydney property prices rise almost 20% in past 12 months</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amid all this discussion has come focus on the supply of housing. Lowe mentioned this aspect, and the prime minister has been quick to echo his statement that \u201cit is hard to escape the conclusion that we need to address the supply side if we are to avoid ever-rising housing costs relative to our incomes\u201d.</p> <p>Within this debate has also been talk of population growth \u2013 especially that of migration. And yet migration figures are down from levels hit at the end of the mining boom, and even the recent peak of December 2012:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Net overseas migration\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Xxnrm/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> And interestingly, there has also been in that time a supply boom \u2013 especially in apartments and flats:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Number of dwelling units under construction\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uJ3jF/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> The boom in apartment construction came at a time when our migrant intake began to fall. So big has been the surge in apartment construction \u2013 especially in Melbourne and Brisbane \u2013 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/14/reserve-bank-rba-warns-big-banks-about-oversupply-of-apartments-in-inner-cities\">the RBA is worried about an oversupply</a> of such housing.</p> <p>And then there is the problem of bank-lending practices. Lowe told his audience he is worried that \u201ctoo many loans are still made where the borrower has the skinniest of income buffers after interest payments\u201d. He noted that \u201cin some cases, lenders are assuming that people can live more frugally than in practice they can, leaving little buffer if things go wrong\u201d.</p> <p>Right now, with record debt levels rising at a time when income growth is flat, apartment construction exploding while population growth is slowing, and all the while house prices in Sydney and Melbourne rising by nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/03/sydney-property-prices-rise-almost-20-in-past-12-months\">20% in the past year</a>, while banks are <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-24/anz-joins-the-rush-to-raise-home-loan-interest-rates/8383924\">already starting</a> to raise interest rates, it feels as though the market is at a point where it wouldn\u2019t take much for things to go very wrong indeed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Troubled housebuilder Bovis Homes has rejected the \u00a31.2bn bid from rival Galliford Try but appointed the former Galliford boss Greg Fitzgerald as its new chief executive. Galliford had been the frontrunner to buy Bovis after Redrow, another housebuilder, pulled out of the bidding battle last week. Galliford had offered 886p a share, valuing Bovis at \u00a31.2bn, while Redrow\u2019s cash-and-shares bid was worth \u00a31.1bn, or 814p a share. Bovis is seeking to draw a line under its recent troubles by recruiting Fitzgerald, the highly regarded former chief executive and chairman of Gallliford, where he worked for more than 30 years. Bovis issued a shock profit warning in late December, prompting the departure of chief executive David Ritchie. Fitzgerald will have to improve build quality and customer service at Bovis, after the company set aside \u00a37m to fix poorly built homes. It was accused of pressuring customers to move into unfinished homes before Christmas so it could hit sales targets. Like the Berkeley boss Tony Pidgley, Fitzgerald has been credited with correctly calling the housing cycle and oversaw a near 200% rise in Galliford\u2019s share price while he was at the helm. He previously founded two housebuilders \u2013 Midas and Gerald Wood Homes \u2013 that were later bought by Galliford. He currently serves as non-executive chairman at Ardent Hire Solutions and Baker Estates. Fitzgerald will receive a three-year pay and shares package worth up to \u00a38.1m. It includes an annual salary of \u00a3650,000; an annual bonus of up to 100% of salary in shares, deferred for three years; a long-term share incentive plan of up to 200% of salary for each of the first two years and 150% of salary thereafter and a one-off share award of up to 100% of salary to recompense Fitzgerald for relinquishing management of certain investments to take up his new role. Bovis stressed that apart from the salary his package is all in shares, which Fitzgerald had insisted on. He replaces the interim chief executive Earl Sibley, who will return to his previous role as finance director of Bovis. Fitzgerald said: \u201cBovis has a great brand, excellent people and a high-quality land bank. I very much look forward to working with the management team to restore Bovis\u2019s position as a leading housebuilder and deliver significantly improved returns to shareholders.\u201d Bovis said it was \u201cmaking good progress with resolving the high level of customer service issues we faced at the start of 2017\u201d. It said more than half its employees had taken part in a bespoke customer training programme, which all staff will have completed by the end of April. Sales and reservations are in line with the company\u2019s expectations. It intends to return to shareholders any excess capital from a balance sheet optimisation programme and from improved cash generation from operations. Bovis shares reacted positively to the news, rising by 2.85% to 870.6p in early trading.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May and the London Stock Exchange chief executive, Xavier Rolet, have launched a charm offensive in Riyadh to woo Saudi ministers with the prospect of London hosting the upcoming flotation of Saudi state oil company Aramco, which is likely to be the largest of all time. Rolet travelled to the Saudi capital independently of May and accompanied the prime minister to a meeting with Aramco\u2019s chief executive Khalid Al-Falih, who is also the kingdom\u2019s energy minister. The meeting, which was the first the prime minister held after touching down in Riyadh on Tuesday, is a sign of the political importance No 10 places on securing LSE\u2019s hosting of the international component of the flotation, which is worth 5% of the $2tn (\u00a31.6tn) company. No 10 officials said the prime minister had set out \u201cthe sort of depth of expertise that there is in London and the UK in terms of financial services, and also the supporting ecosystem \u2013 accountancy, legal and also the depth of investment opportunities that there are in the UK\u201d. London\u2019s hosting of the flotation was specifically mentioned in several meetings on Tuesday, according to Downing Street sources accompanying the prime minister\u2019s visit. \u201cThe prime minister set out the advantages and the opportunities which are available in London. She set out the wealth of investment opportunity and proven experience that we have,\u201d a source said. The two-day visit to Saudi Arabia has been criticised by human rights charities as a sign of the UK\u2019s desire to hawk its expertise to countries with chequered human rights records in the aftermath of the UK\u2019s formal notification of EU departure, with Liam Fox also visiting the Philippines\u2019 controversial president, Rodrigo Duterte. On Wednesday May and Rolet met Yasir al-Rumayyan, the director of the Saudi public investment fund \u2013 a sovereign wealth fund \u2013 to discuss inward investment in the UK with a focus on science, education and infrastructure, though no particular projects have been agreed. Trade talks have historically focused on arms sales, but sources insisted the prime minister had not brought a full trade delegation with her on this trip, with no one from the British multinational arms manufacturer BAE Systems. In 2015, 83% of UK arms exports almost \u00a3900m \u2013 went to Saudi Arabia, according to analysis of HMRC figures by Greenpeace. Downing Street announced on Monday it had drawn up plans with Riyadh to boost support for Saudi\u2019s much-vaunted Vision 2030 strategic plan for diversifying the Saudi economy to decrease its over-reliance on oil, spearheaded by the deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who met May on Tuesday.",

      "bodyText": "British businesses must crack down on excessive pay for bosses and improve boardroom diversity to restore public trust after scandals at Sports Direct and collapsed retailer BHS, MPs have warned. Among their wide-ranging recommendations, the MPs\u2019 committee called for a ban on long-term investment plans, complex multi-year pay deals that have been criticised for masking the true extent of huge awards to executives and for encouraging short-term thinking. Responding to the gulf in pay that has emerged between bosses and average workers, MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee also called on firms to publish pay ratios between top executives and other employees and to put workers on remuneration committees. The MPs urged the government to grant the corporate governance watchdog more powers to hold company directors to account. \u201cThe UK corporate governance system is recognised throughout the world as of high quality. However, recent scandals and the issue of executive pay have undermined public trust in corporate culture,\u201d said the committee\u2019s chair, Labour MP Iain Wright. \u201cThat, together with rising stakeholder expectations, changing business models and technology, means that corporate governance needs to evolve to provide assurance to investors and wider society.\u201d The committee highlighted revelations that workers at Sports Direct were being paid less than the legal minimum wage and the demise of BHS, which cost 11,000 jobs and prompted MPs to declare that the retailer had been subject to \u201csystematic plunder\u201d by former owners Sir Philip Green, Dominic Chappell and their respective \u201changers-on\u201d. Wednesday\u2019s report linked those scandals to \u201cserious failings in corporate governance\u201d and told companies to take action to repair the damage. It also urged them to curb executive pay, which has ballooned in recent years while most other workers have seen little growth in their wages. The report comes amid warnings to Britain\u2019s biggest companies that they face a wave of revolts this annual meeting season and risk a government clampdown on excessive remuneration unless they show restraint over executive pay. The committee of MPs used its report to call on businesses to simplify the structure of executive pay and scrap LTIPs. \u201cNo new LTIPs should be agreed from the start of 2018 and existing agreements should not be renewed,\u201d the report concluded. It said that gathering evidence for the report, MPs were told by one witness \u201cpay was now so complex that executives themselves do not always understand their own remuneration\u201d. It also heard LTIPs could distort executive behaviour, with chief executives tailoring decisions to affect the share price around the time their shares were due to vest. Wright, whose committee last year accused billionaire Mike Ashley of running Sports Direct like a Victorian workhouse, said successful companies could not be disconnected from society. The MPs\u2019 new report recommended companies establish stakeholder advisory panels, including workers, consumers, and suppliers. It also suggested workers be represented on remuneration committees and for the chairs of those committees to be expected to resign if fewer than 75% of shareholders fail to approve the company\u2019s pay policy. But it stopped short of demanding a worker representatives on boards \u2013 something proposed and then watered down by Theresa May last year. On gender diversity, the committee urged the government to set a target for the number of new senior appointments going to women and it backed a recommendation on improving ethnic diversity on boards made in the government-commissioned Parker report last year. The report also called for a new and stronger voluntary code of governance for private firms. \u201cThe collapse of BHS highlighted the flaws in damage which private companies can do,\u201d said Wright. The Institute of Directors said that call reflected its own longstanding concerns about the lack of transparency in the governance of unlisted firms. \u201cA code for private companies is supported by two-thirds of IoD members and should be established for the largest firms,\u201d said IoD director general Stephen Martin. The committee also recommended that the government give additional powers to the Financial Reporting Council, which polices the corporate governance codes for listed companies. The watchdog should be able to publicly report on any failings of a board or its individual members. \u201cIf companies fail to engage with the FRC, the committee recommends the FRC be given authority to initiate legal action,\u201d said the MPs\u2019 report. The TUC welcomed that and other recommendations. \u201cBritish people are fed up with the bad behaviour of big business. Workers are getting a raw deal, and our economy is harmed by short-term thinking in the board room. Reform is badly needed, and the government should take up many of the excellent ideas in this report,\u201d said the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady. Stefan Stern,\u200e the director of the High Pay Centre, welcomed the report, including the committee\u2019s demand that companies publish pay ratios between the chief executive and both senior executives and all UK employees. \u201cThe government should reflect on the powerful case for reform made in this excellent report, and act on it,\u201d he said.",

Reform is badly needed, and the government should take up many of the excellent ideas in this report,\u201d said the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady.</p> <p>Stefan Stern,\u200e the director of the High Pay Centre, welcomed the report, including the committee\u2019s demand that companies publish pay ratios between the chief executive and both senior executives and all UK employees.</p> <p>\u201cThe government should reflect on the powerful case for reform made in this excellent report, and act on it,\u201d he said.</p>",
