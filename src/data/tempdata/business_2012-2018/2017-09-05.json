      "bodyText": "Asda has been forced to pay back hundreds of thousands of pounds to dozens of suppliers after breaching an industry code governing fair dealing. The company, named as the worst supermarket in its treatment of suppliers earlier this year, was found to have demanded up front payments worth up to a quarter of the value of annual sales of particular products in order for suppliers to retain their place on the shelf. Some of those who refused to make these payments, which were greater than those agreed in suppliers\u2019 contracts, were given notice that they would be ousted within as little as four to eight weeks, according to the industry watchdog. Other changes including cost price reductions were also demanded from suppliers with as little as 24 hours notice under the group\u2019s project renewal plan, designed in partnership with the Bain &amp; Company consultancy to save costs and help cut prices for shoppers. The demands, reported by the Guardian last year, were in breach of the grocery supply code of practice \u2013 government-backed regulations that can attract a fine of up to 1% of UK turnover. In a \u201ccode clarification\u201d document published this week, the Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA), said it had not decided to launch a formal investigation into Asda\u2019s behaviour or issue a fine. However the regulator, which oversees a government-backed industry code of practice, said a review had found that the Walmart-owned chain had breached \u201cthe overarching principle of fair dealing\u201d in the code with conversations \u201cdesigned to carry an implication of detriment if any supplier declined to agree\u201d to its demands. The watchdog said there was no need to launch an investigation. Asda had \u201cproactively engaged with suppliers to rectify any lump sum arrangements, which should not have been made\u201d and put further safeguards in place to prevent any further breaches. The GCA report added that the project renewal strategy had been designed by a consultancy commissioned by Asda to achieve cost savings, and it was clear that \u201cthe role of the third party consultants was closely bound up with the issues raised\u201d, as they had been able to achieve bonuses based on the amount of money they were able to save Asda. The supermarket said project renewal, launched in late 2015 under former chief executive Andy Clarke, had been Asda-led with support from Bain. Asda\u2019s current chief executive, Sean Clarke, said: \u201cOur mission is to save customers money through low prices by always securing the lowest possible costs built on a foundation of strong, trusted partnerships with our suppliers and absolutely in line with the groceries supply code of practice (Gscop). \u201cThe matter raised in the GCA\u2019s case study occurred over a year ago and since then we have significantly strengthened our Gscop compliance programme. We have engaged openly and transparently with the GCA to support her enquiries in keeping with her collaborative approach.\u201d Bain said in a statement: \u201cAs per our company policy, we do not speak publicly about who may or may not be our client.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economic model is broken and produces widespread inequality, the Archbishop of Canterbury has warned in a report backed by business leaders. Justin Welby said the UK needed to make fundamental choices about the direction of its economy, in a study that found the gains from growth are being diverted into profits rather than wages. \u201cOur economic model is broken,\u201d said Welby. \u201cBritain stands at a watershed moment where we need to make fundamental choices about the sort of economy we need. We are failing those who will grow up into a world where the gap between the richest and poorest parts of the country is significant and destabilising.\u201d The report by the IPPR thinktank\u2019s commission on economic justice, which features senior business and public figures alongside Welby, stressed that all political parties needed to reject the current patterns of economic growth that delivered most of the gains to corporations and the richest in society. It said the situation had worsened in recent years as workers struggled to make ends meet after the longest period of earnings stagnation for 150 years. The interim report by the commission, which was set up last year, proposes fundamental reform of the British economy \u201con a scale comparable with the Attlee reforms of the 1940s and the Thatcher revolution of the 1980s\u201d. Pointing to rising debt levels, the report called for an urgent public debate on the role of banks and the financial sector in the British economy. It also flagged extra support for trade unions to act as a bulwark against shareholder interests in the workplace. The report, which is expected to produce a series of policy initiatives when it unveils final conclusions next autumn, also said ministers must tackle the market dominance of digital companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. A spokesman for the Treasury said the chancellor, Philip Hammond, rejected the accusations in the report that the government had cut investment and presided over a rise in inequality. He claimed that employment was at a record high, the public finances were in better shape and the Gini co-efficient measure of inequality was at a 30-year low. But the chancellor accepted that a higher level of investment was needed to promote growth. \u201cThat is why we are investing \u00a323bn in infrastructure, R&amp;D and housing while also reforming technical education to prepare for the high paid, high skilled jobs of the future,\u201d the Treasury spokesman said. Theresa May is under pressure to reboot her premiership after failing to gain a majority in the last election. She was criticised from many inside her own party for ditching previous pledges to support the \u201cjust about managing\u201d group in favour of further austerity. The IPPR\u2019s initiative has echoes of the thinktank\u2019s commission on social justice, which provided many of the policies adopted by New Labour when it came to power in 1997. It is understood the commission hopes ministers will accept some of the criticisms in the report and be prepared to implement many of the proposals. Tom Kibasi, the IPPR director and chair of the commission, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a British economic model. We have an economic muddle. \u201cThe persistent economic problems we have experienced since the 2008 financial crash won\u2019t be fixed with a bit of tinkering. There is a growing consensus across business, trade unions and civil society that a radical new approach is now needed.\u201d The commission\u2019s membership is drawn from a wide group of business leaders and civil society groups including: Dominic Barton, the global managing partner of the consultancy McKinsey and Company; Helena Morrissey, Legal &amp; General\u2019s head of personal investment; Sir Charlie Mayfield, the chairman of the John Lewis Partnership; Sara Bryson, a community organiser in Tyne and Wear for the charity Citizens UK; and Sally Tallant, the director of the Liverpool Biennial contemporary art festival. John McDonnell MP, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThe commission\u2019s findings drive home the deep problems of the British economy, which have been gravely worsened by seven years of Tory failure that has seen average wages fall and debt rise. \u201cThe Tories have given huge tax breaks to the super-rich and giant corporations, but failed to deliver the investment in infrastructure, skills and research and development that are needed to create the secure, high-wage jobs of the future. As the report shows, the result is an economy dominated by insecurity and falling living standards.\u201d The commission has conducted fresh analysis that shows average earnings per employee have fallen by 6% despite GDP per head rising by 12% since 2010. It said that since the 1970s the share of national income which has gone to wages has gradually declined, from 80% to 73%, while the share going to profits has increased. It said the wage share is now the lowest it has been since the second world war. Kibasi said the report\u2019s analysis found that the economy \u201cis no longer raising living standards for a majority of the population, breaking the \u2018economic promise\u2019 that has underpinned public life since the second world war. The economy\u2019s deep weaknesses make it unfit to face the challenges of the 2020s.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK service sector growth slows as car sales fall dramatically", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Business leaders have blamed the uncertainty created by Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union for the slowest pace of output growth in the services sector for almost a year. Financial data provider Markit said Brexit uncertainty and higher import costs arising from the slump in the pound were behind the stumbling performance of the UK\u2019s largest business sector last month. In the first half of the year the services sector, which accounts for almost 80% of economic activity, kept the UK from slipping back into recession. But a decline in real wages growth after a spike in inflation and the reluctance of households to accumulate debt at the pace seen in the first half of 2017 appeared to have hit the demand for services. Markit said its purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for the sector fell to 53.2 points in August from 53.8 the previous month amid signs that \u201cBrexit-related uncertainty continued to undermine business confidence\u201d. Anything above 50 indicates expansion. Without a strong rebound over the next few months, analysts said the UK could be heading for another quarter of 0.3% GDP growth and an annual figure that struggles to get above 1%. The survey followed news of a dramatic fall in car sales during August that analysts warned was connected to household concerns over the outcome of Britain\u2019s talks with the EU. Private car sales fell by 9.9% in August, compared with the same month last year, to leave the overall annual drop at 6.4%. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said August was traditionally a month for low car sales before the September number plate change. The car industry body said the 76,000 sales still represented the third biggest August in 10 years. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said car industry sales were declining from all time highs, but nevertheless August\u2019s figures represented the fifth month of falling sales and pointed to \u201ca clear loss of momentum in the sector\u201d. Last month Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, warned that motor manufacturers feared the industry\u2019s revival over the past couple of decades could be put at risk by Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. He said: \u201cA lot of people have spent the best part of decades turning round the industry, when you think back to how it was characterised in the 70s, 80s and into the 90s. It is very different now. It has had very difficult times and it is a cyclical industry, and there is a fear that that success could be put at jeopardy.\u201d The fall in car sales and weaker services sector growth is \u201cmore evidence that the hit to real incomes from sterling\u2019s depreciation and heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook \u2014 both attributable to Brexit \u2014 are holding the economy back\u201d, said Samual Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Markit said that on a more positive note, the largest majority of services firms since July 2015 reported that work backlogs increased in August. And in response, firms hired the most workers in 19 months and offered slightly higher wages to retain key staff. But the new orders index declined to 54.2 in August from 54.7 in July, signalling continued weakness in demand. Chris Sood-Nicholls, head of global services at Lloyds Bank commercial banking, said: \u201cBrexit brings an added layer of complexity and uncertainty, with many investment decisions going on hold. This uncertainty is also impacting sentiment and making it difficult for businesses to plan long term.\u201d He said the continued weakness of sterling continued to drive price increases and consumers and businesses were feeling the pinch. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see anything immediately on the horizon that will nudge the index out of its fairly flat performance,\u201d he said. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange dealer WorldFirst, said that together with the PMIs for manufacturing and construction, \u201cthe services number indicates a quarterly UK GDP rate of 0.3% \u2013 and slowing all the time\u201d. He said: \u201cBrexit uncertainty, higher costs and lower investment are slowing UK output to a chronic crawl. The summer months may have been warm but the recessional risks for the UK economy are only increasing as we move into autumn.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "And finally... US factories have posted their biggest drop in orders in three years - giving traders another excuse to kick the dollar. Reuters has the details: New orders for U.S.-made goods recorded their biggest drop in nearly three years in July,but orders for capital goods were stronger than previously reported, pointing to robust business spending at the start of the third quarter. Factory goods orders tumbled 3.3 percent amid a slump in demand for transportation equipment, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. That was the biggest drop since August 2014. June\u2019s data was revised to show orders rising 3.2 percent instead of the previously reported 3.0 percent surge. The dollar has now dropped to a new one-week low against the yen, below \u00a5109. And the pound has now risen above $1.30 for the first time since mid-August. And that\u2019s a good moment to stop. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW And it\u2019s that time of year when Greece returns to the headlines with the country\u2019s finance minister discussing bailout progress with the EU\u2019s economic commissioner Pierre Moscovici this afternoon. Helena Smith reports from Athens The meeting at 4:30pm Brussels time effectively kicks off yet another bailout review between Greece and the international lenders keeping the debt-stricken nation afloat. One week before technical teams return to Athens, Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister and his deputy Giorgos Houliarakis, will attempt to gauge the mood of creditors with Moscovici. The negotiations, which begin in earnest next month, will focus on around 100 \u2018prior actions,\u2019 or reforms, Athens will have to implement if it is to exit its third, \u20ac86bn bailout by August next year. The leftist-led government is hoping the review \u2013 the third since the last financial rescue program was agreed in August 2015 \u2013 will be completed by December enabling it to return to international markets to finance its debt in 2018. Today\u2019s meeting comes against the background of controversy caused by Moscovici\u2019s assertion that Greece\u2019s financial rescue was far from democratic. Speaking to Corriere della Sera, the EU commissioner said: \u201cIt is a scandal in terms of democratic processes, not because the decisions were scandalous, but because the fate of a nation was decided in this way, with the imposition of detailed decisions on pensions and the labour market ... I am talking about the basic details of the life of a country that were decided by a body, behind closed doors, whose work is prepared by technocrats ... without the minimum control of a parliament, without the media really knowing what is being said.\u201d Film fans will remember that concentrated orange juice futures play a key role in classic movie Trading Places. And they\u2019re also in the news today for more serious reasons - they\u2019re surging as America prepares for its next hurricane to arrive. Hurricane Irma is strengthening, and heading towards Florida and Puerto Rico. So while local authorities prepare for major disruption, traders are anticipating that Florida\u2019s fruit-producing economy will take a hit. The price of frozen orange juice futures has already jumped by 6% in heavy trading: Over in New York, the US stock market has opened in the red. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by 0.3%, or 71 points, in early trading to 21,916 points. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also lost ground, as traders got back to work after Monday\u2019s Labor Day break, and a weekend dominated by North Korea. Dollar drops as Brainard gives dovish speech Over in America, a key central bank policymaker has argued that US interest rates could rise more slowly than expected. Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard says that her colleagues should be cautious before voting to increase borrowing costs again, as underlying inflation pressures are low. That\u2019s a sign that Brainard may not be keen to raise borrowing costs at the next Fed meeting, later this month. She told the Economic Club of New York that strong unemployment figures don\u2019t tell the full story... There is a notable disconnect between signs that the economy is in the neighborhood of full employment and a string of lower-than-projected inflation readings, especially since inflation has come in stubbornly below target for five years\u2026 Brainard also hints that raising borrowing costs too fast can be dangerous; if it slows growth too much, then the Fed might be forced to cut rates again. Sustainably achieving our inflation objective is especially important, given the apparent persistently low level of the neutral rate and the resulting limited room for maneuver above the effective lower bound. Brainard is known as one of the more dovish Fed members anyway, but these comments have still knocked the dollar to a one-week low against the yen. Drama has been in short supply across Europe\u2019s stock markets so far today. The French and German indices are up a bit, while London\u2019s FTSE 100 has dipped slightly into the red. The pound has recovered a little ground against the US dollar to $1.295, from $1.293, despite the slowdown in the service sector. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Surprisingly sterling wasn\u2019t too bothered about the dip, instead rising 0.2% against both the dollar, weakened by the North Korea issue, and the euro, which is facing the uncertainty of Thursday\u2019s ECB meeting. This meant the FTSE lost whatever meagre momentum it had after the bell, the index slipping 0.1% to loiter just above 7400. But....what happened to those worries over North Korea that everyone was talking about yesterday? Well, there\u2019s been nothing (yet) today to raise the risk of nuclear destruction, so traders have taken their minds off it. David Madden of CMC Markets cautions that this situation may not last long... We have seen this scenario before where tensions rise and stocks fall, followed by no new developments, and then equities bounce back. The situation is still ongoing, so today\u2019s positive move could be down to short covering and a bit of bargain hunting. In tense times while these, not many investors would buy into the market for the long haul. Obviously it\u2019s good news that British service sector companies took on more staff in August (as mentioned earlier). But, it also highlights a wider problem. Unless this hiring creates extra growth, then the UK economy will simply become more unproductive (as we\u2019ll have more people cranking out the same amount of output). Economist Rupert Seggins predicts that productivity will actually fall this quarter: So what\u2019s happening? The suspicion is that Britain\u2019s services sector is relying on low-paid, insecure workers for growth, rather than splashing on expensive new equipment. This map shows how little capital is invested per worker in the UK, compared to say Germany: City economists are in agreement - the slowdown in Britain\u2019s service sector last month is a worry. Here\u2019s some reaction: Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management. \u201cUnlike the manufacturing PMI which beat expectations, today\u2019s services PMI dropped to an 11-month low, with respondents noting the heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook weighing on growth. The numbers are consistent with the economy continuing to make modest progress in the current quarter. \u201cThe most interesting aspect of the report was the reference to cost pressure and the outlook for hiring which accelerated for the third consecutive month. As unemployment is already low, this adds to the concerns that labour shortages could start to push wages higher in the months ahead. With this in mind, today\u2019s figures could make the Monetary Policy Committee sit up and take note. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst \u201cTogether with manufacturing and construction PMIs, today\u2019s services number indicates a quarterly UK GDP rate of 0.3% \u2013 and slowing all the time. Brexit uncertainty, higher costs and lower investment are slowing UK output to a chronic crawl. The summer months may have been warm but the recessional risks for the UK economy are only increasing as we move into Autumn.\u201d Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, \u201cThough the UK\u2019s services sector continues to expand, August\u2019s reading suggests it\u2019s doing so at a worryingly slow pace. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen such sluggish growth since last September and, although the services sector may not have the potential to dampen GDP as much as manufacturing could, Q3 looks in trouble of coming in below expectations. \u201cBusiness conditions remain fragile and unpredictable. As inflationary pressures and slow wage growth intensify, consumer-facing businesses are likely to have felt a drastic slide in trade over the last few months and that spells tougher times ahead for the UK. Andy Bruce of Reuters has tweeted a nice chart, showing how the UK services PMI is too low to justify an interest rate hike. The yellow line shows the services PMI, while the green spikes are interest rate hikes or cuts. The pound has dipped a little, to $1.2920, following today\u2019s services sector PMI. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says traders are dialling back their expectations for future interest rate rises. The services PMI data has shown that the UK\u2019s economy is losing its steam and this means that the Bank of England would have to continue its support. The services PMI data fell short of forecast and traders have pushed the sell button on the back of this.... The Brexit negotiations are going nowhere and this is weighing on the economy and momentum is gradually losing its strength. The UK urgently needs a credible \u2018transition plan\u2019 for life after Brexit to restore confidence among companies, tweets Julian Jessop of the Institute of Economic Affairs. Duncan Brock, of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, warns that some UK services companies were \u201cparalysed by economic hesitancy\u201d in August. Others, though, shrugged off the uncertainty and pressed on with new product launches. Brock saus August was: \u201cA slowdown month as the services sector comes off the boil, challenged by a general unwillingness to spend and invest, alongside fragility in confidence amongst consumers as a result of Brexit. It\u2019s not all bad news, though. UK service sector companies created more jobs for the third month running in August, at the fastest rate since the start of 2016. Today\u2019s service sector report, combined with earlier (strong) manufacturing and (weak) construction data for August, suggests that the UK economy will only grow by 0.3% this quarter. Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson says: \u201cA summer slowdown was evident in the economy as the August PMI surveys showed slower rates of expansion in services and construction offsetting an improved performance in the manufacturing sector. The resulting overall expansion was the weakest for six months. Although the latest two months\u2019 data put the economy on course for another 0.3% expansion in the third quarter, momentum is being gradually lost. Williamson also warns that uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is hurting confidence: \u201cRobust manufacturing growth means the economy may be rebalancing towards goods production, aided by the weaker pound, but the slowdowns in services and construction send warning signals about the health of the economy. \u201cThe overall level of optimism also remained subdued, mainly linked to Brexit uncertainty, close to levels that have previously been indicative of the economy stalling or even contracting. Yesterday\u2019s construction PMI suggested that Britain\u2019s builders are close to recession, but Friday\u2019s manufacturing PMI hit a seven-month high. Customer-facing companies such as hotels, restaurants, cinemas, hairdressers and gyms suffered the weakest growth last month, Markit says. Breaking! In another blow to the UK economy, growth in its dominant services sector has fallen to its lowest rate in almost a year. Data firm Markit reports that business activity in August rose at the weakest rate since last September. Firms blamed \u201csubdued client demand\u201d and rising uncertainty about the UK economic outlook after seeing growth slow this year. New order growth also slowed, with nervous clients holding back on spending decisions. This pulled the UK services PMI down to 53.2, from 53.8 in July. Any reading over 50 shows growth. More to follow.... Chris Bosworth, director of strategy at Close Brothers Motor Finance, says the drop in UK car sales in August isn\u2019t a big surprise. August is a notoriously testing month for new car registrations as consumers divert their spending toward family activities and holidays, so these figures shouldn\u2019t come as a complete shock to the industry. However, Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is also casting a shadow over the sector, Bosworth adds: \u201cWith Brexit negotiations well underway and the government announcing radical changes to the sale of fossil fuelled cars, the motor industry is entering a wave of prolonged uncertainty. This will likely have an impact on consumer spending habits. The Bank of England has already announced that car finance deals have eased as a result. \u201cIn fact, 5.5 million British motorists say Brexit has already had a direct impact on their car purchasing plans and has made them more likely to purchase a used car or to hold off their purchase altogether \u2013 all of which can have a knock-on effect on the industry and the wider economy. That said, now that the new car registration plates have been released, we expect consumers will splash out on new cars over the next month, keeping in line with the annual trend.\u201d Diesel bore the brunt of the sales decline in August, the SMMT says: Demand for petrol hybrid and pure electric battery powered cars increased substantially, up 74.9% and 62.5%, while plug-in hybrid registrations rose 38.5%. Conventional petrols grew 3.8% and diesels fell -21.3%. Breaking! Britain\u2019s car industry has suffered its fifth monthly fall in sales. New car registrations shrank by 6.4% in August, extending a sales decline that began in April and has fuelled worries over the UK economy. It means that sales in 2017 are 2.4% lower than a year ago, with 1,640,241 new cars joining British roads since January. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which compiled the report, reckons drivers are waiting for the latest number plates to arrive this month. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, said, August is typically a quiet month for the new car market as consumers and businesses delay purchases until the arrival of the new number plate in September. With the new 67-plate now available and a range of new models in showrooms, we anticipate the continuation of what are historically high levels of demand. Just in: Growth across the eurozone\u2019s service sector has hit a seven-month low, but remains robust. Markit\u2019s euro-area services PMI has come in at 54.7, down from July\u2019s 55.4, and below the \u2018flash reading\u2019 of 54.9 released in late August. Growth picked up in Ireland and Germany, but slowed in Italy, France and Spain. Lego says its overall performance in the first half of 2017 was \u201cmixed\u201d, explaining why it is cutting so many jobs. Revenues declined in established markets such as the United States and in parts of Europe, but it achieved double-digit growth in China Here\u2019s the topline: Revenue down 5 percent to DKK 14.9 billion compared with DKK 15.7 billion Operating profit down 6 percent to DKK 4.4 billion compared with DKK 4.7 billion Net profit down 3 percent at DKK 3.4 billion compared with DKK 3.5 billion Crumbs. Lego is planning to cut around 1,400 jobs, after suffering a 5% drop in revenues this year. In a statement, LEGO Group Chairman J\u00f8rgen Vig Knudstorp says: \u201cWe are disappointed by the decline in revenue in our established markets, and we have taken steps to address this. Those steps include sweeping job cuts, that will reduce its global workforce of 18,200 by around 8%. Most of the 1,400 positions will be cut before the end of the year. Knudstorp adds: \u201cWe are very sorry to make changes which may interfere with the lives of many of our colleagues. Our colleagues put so much passion into their work every day and we are deeply grateful for that. Unfortunately, it is essential for us to make these tough decisions.\u201d Bad news from the bricks economy.... Enigmatically, Lego adds: The Group now prepares to reset the company to deliver on its long-term ambition to reach more children all over the world with LEGO\u00ae experiences. Oh dear. Reuters is reporting that UK car sales took another fall in August. They\u2019ve crunched through some \u2018preliminary data\u2019, and report demand declined for the fifth month in a row.: British new car sales fell by between 6 and 7 percent year-on-year in August, according to preliminary data released by an industry body on Tuesday. New car registrations have fallen year-on-year in April, May, June and July, the longest run of declines since 2011, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers andTraders (SMMT). The SMMT will publish full data for the month of August at 0800 GMT [9am BST]. August was a rough month for Indian companies, it appears. New tax changes and the controversial demonetization policy both hurt growth, according to the latest PMI reports. The Nikkei India Services Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index hit 47.5 in August, up from July\u2019s 45.9, but still showing a contraction. Markit, which compiles the survey, says India\u2019s new Goods and Services Tax (GST) - which replaced a swath of local taxes - hurt spending. Pollyanna De Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit warns; \u201cThe underlying trend for services is one of uncertainty. Businesses are holding back on investment, leading to falls in employment. At the same time, input costs are increasing and firms are unable to fully pass these on due to competitive pressures. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom, however, as activity, new business and employment showed much slower rates of reduction than those noted in the prior survey period.\u201d China\u2019s private sector is growing at its fastest rate in six months, according to new data released overnight. Data firm Caixin reported that, in August, Chinese business activity expanded at the fastest rate since February. Factories and service sector firms both reported a pick-up in demand, thanks to improving market conditions and a rise in new orders. It may mean that Beijing\u2019s attempts to avoid a sharp slowdown are paying off. Caixin reports that: Services activity growth strengthens to three-month high, while manufacturing output grows modestly New orders increase at faster pace at both service providers and goods producers Inflationary pressures build further And this pushed its Composite Output Index up to 52.4, up from 51.9 in July. Dr Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group warns, though, that firms are facing higher costs: The recovery in both manufacturing and services has led the economic outlook to continue to improve. But we need to closely watch whether the recent rises in input costs will weigh on corporate profits and fuel inflation.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we get a flurry of service data from around the world will show how the global economy fared last month. Britain\u2019s service sector contributes around 80% of the nation\u2019s output, so the UK services PMI will be closely watched. Economists predict that growth held up OK in August, although after yesterday\u2019s weak construction data (growth at a one-year low!) a negative surprise can\u2019t be ruled out. The City is confident that Britain\u2019s services PMI will beat the 50-point mark that splits expansion from contraction, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: In July we saw a nice uptick to 53.8, after a bit of a slowdown in June, and it is expected that we might see some softening in August back to 53.5, though it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if we did outperform, particularly in areas that support travel, leisure and tourism. Europe\u2019s service sector is likely to notch up another strong month of growth, with the eurozone PMI expected to hit 54.9. We also get new UK car sales this morning, for August. Sales have fallen for the last four months, and there are fears they could still be dropping.... The markets look quiet this morning, after dipping yesterday amid worries over North Korea. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is expected to rise by a modest 8 points, with traders hopeful that military action can be avoided. Americans will be getting back to work (and pushing their white outfits to the back of the closet) after yesterday\u2019s Labor Day holiday. Several Federal Reserve policy makers are due to speak, and may give hints on when US interest rates may next rise. Here\u2019s the agenda: 9am BST: Eurozone service sector PMI for August 9am BST: UK car sales for August 9.30am BST: UK service sector PMI for August 10am BST: Eurozone retail sales for August 3pm BST: US factory orders for July",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has failed to meet a pledge to offer guaranteed hours to shopworkerss and transfer some warehouse staff to permanent contracts a year after promising widespread changes in working practices. The retail group controlled by the Newcastle United owner, Mike Ashley, promised to ensure that all staff were treated with dignity and respect in a report on its working practices published on 6 September last year. Key pledges included offering casual retail staff guaranteed hours instead of zero-hours contracts and testing a scheme to transfer 10 warehouse staff a month from insecure agency contracts to Sports Direct\u2019s employment. The review was initiated after the Guardian exposed how temporary workers at its depots were effectively receiving hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. It also came after heavy criticism of corporate governance at Sports Direct which led to investor pressure to oust its chairman, Keith Hellawell. Hellawell remains under pressure from shareholders, with Hermes Investment Management on Tuesday saying he and senior independent non-executive Simon Bentley should go after failing to engage on a one-to-one basis with investors. Leon Kamhi, head of responsibility at Hermes, added that Wednesday\u2019s meeting in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, would be an \u201cexcellent opportunity for the board to update investors\u201d on progress made in implementing the working practices report. His comments come as the Unite union said Sports Direct, which has been widely criticised for its heavy use of zero-hours contracts in stores, continues to advertise roles with \u201cno guaranteed hours of work\u201d. There is no evidence that casual staff already employed had been offered contracts with guaranteed hours. The union added that there was no evidence that Sports Direct was moving significant numbers of agency staff at its warehouse into direct employment. The Unite assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said: \u201cThis revelation shows it is \u2018business as usual\u2019 at Sports Direct and casts doubt on just how sincere it is about cleaning up its act.\u201d Turner added: \u201cOne year on Sports Direct has been caught redhanded breaking its promise to offer workers the security of knowing what hours they will work and how much they will earn from week to next. \u201cIt blows a hole in Sports Direct\u2019s commitment to treat workers with dignity and respect.\u201d Trade Union Share Owners (Tuso), a group which last year supported a resolution calling for an independent review of Sports Direct\u2019s working practices, has written to investors urging them to vote against Hellawell\u2019s reappointment as it raised concerns about health and safety issues, the continued use of zero-hours contracts and the lack of a truly independent review of working practices. In an update to investors, Tuso said there had been 11 accidents at the Sports Direct Shirebrook warehouse since 7 September last year, according to a freedom of information request made to Bolsover district council. These included numerous back and head injuries and three \u201cmajor\u201d injuries, including a fractured hand, damage to and potential loss of sight in one eye and a head injury, which led to a loss of consciousness. The group urged the Health and Safety Executive to help the local authority investigate as a matter of urgency. It said workers had raised concerns about crowded isles, defective warehouse equipment and products stacked dangerously high. A spokesman for Sports Direct declined to comment on the union claims. In its annual report, the company said: \u201cWe have made positive progress across the business as we continue to strive to ensure that all of our people are treated with dignity and respect.\u201d It added that it had \u201ctaken steps to promote stability for [these groups of workers] by ensuring changes to scheduled hours by the company [were] kept to a minimum\u201d. It said: \u201cOur research found that in common with surveys by other companies, the vast majority of our casual staff wish to remain on flexible arrangements.\u201d The company has elected a worker representative to sit on its board and said he would continue to ensure good practice. But Tuso said: \u201c[Sports Direct] missed a crucial opportunity to give investors and stakeholders the reassurance that they are 100% committed to dealing with well-documented workplace abuses and corporate governance failures\u201d by going back on a promise to appoint an independent party to conduct a \u201c360 degree review\u201d of its corporate governance. After more than one candidate backed out, the company in January appointed the law firm RPC which has a long history of working for Sports Direct. Hellawell has pledged to step down if more than half the group\u2019s independent investors fail to back him at Wednesday\u2019s AGM. Last year, more than half of independent shareholders voted against the chairman, forcing the company to hold a second vote in January where he was kept in place only with the backing of Ashley, who owns more than half of Sports Direct\u2019s shares.",

    "webTitle": "Lego to axe 1,400 jobs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lego is to cut 1,400 jobs before the end of the year in a bid to scale back the 85-year-old business after suffering its first drop in sales in more than a decade. The Danish toymaker said it was hit by weaker demand in established markets such as the US and parts of Europe and admitted that the organisation had become too complex over the past five years to support global growth. Lego said the decision to cut the jobs \u2013 representing about 8% of its 18,200 global workforce \u2013 was a difficult one, but had to be made as the company presses \u201cthe reset button\u201d. \u201cWe are very sorry to make changes which may interfere with the lives of many of our colleagues,\u201d said J\u00f8rgen Vig Knudstorp, the chairman of the group. \u201cOur colleagues put so much passion into their work every day and we are deeply grateful for that. Unfortunately, it is essential for us to make these tough decisions.\u201d Lego is based in Billund, Denmark, and and is still controlled by the founding Kristensen family, which has a 75% stake. It has five main office hubs, in Billund, Enfield in the US, London, Singapore, and Shanghai. It also has factories in Mexico, Hungary, Czech Republic, China and Denmark, and employs about 900 people in the UK. Revenue fell 6% in the first half of 2017 to 14.9bn Danish krone (\u00a31.8bn), while net profit was down 3% at 3.4bn Danish krone. It was the first fall in sales since 2004 - a year after the maker of plastic bricks almost collapsed. Knudstorp said that despite double-digit growth in China in the first half of the year, \u201cwe are disappointed by the decline in revenue in our established markets, and we have taken steps to address this\u201d. \u201cWe are working closely with our partners and we are confident that we have the long-term potential of reaching more children in our well-established markets in Europe and the United States. We also see strong growth opportunities in growing markets such as China.\u201d He said the business was suffering from an overly complex structure that resulted from rapid growth over the past five years. Knudstorp was chief executive for most of the period. \u201cIn the process, we have added complexity into the organisation which now in turn makes it harder for us to grow further. As a result, we have now pressed the reset-button for the entire group. \u201cThis means we will build a smaller and less complex organisation than we have today, which will simplify our business model in order to reach more children. It will also impact our costs. Finally, in some markets the reset entails addressing a clean-up of inventories across the entire value chain. The work is well under way.\u201d Lego last month replaced its British chief executive, the first non-Danish person to run the toy company, after just eight months. The company said that at 61, Bali Padda was never expected to be in the position long term and said that the decision was not down to performance. The company had enjoyed a decade of growth, helped by franchise deals based on Hollywood films such as Star Wars, Harry Potter and Indiana Jones, and the introduction of the Lego Friends range aimed at girls. Success continued with the launch of The Lego Movie in 2014. Lou Ellerton, associate director at the brand consultancy Mash, said Lego had over-extended its product offering, partly because it has licensed so many popular brands, and was operating in a competitive environment. \u201cLego has tripled its workforce and more than tripled the number of lines they offer [over recent years]. Realistically there is a limit to how much people can buy at any one time. There has been so much licensing they are over-extended.\u201d Ellerton said there were rival, cheaper products available that might not have the famous licensed names but were essentially toy building blocks. \u201cParents are becoming much more conscious of value for money on toys,\u201d she said. Frederique Tutt, a global toy industry analyst at the consumer research group NPD, said that despite the sales dip, Lego was the number one manufacturer in terms of toy sales in Europe and in the UK in 2017 so far. \u201cLego\u2019s pole position with toy buyers is proof of its universal appeal,\u201d Tutt said. \u201cThe brand has innovated year after year and built up a loyal fan base, enabling it to compete effectively in a thriving toy market.\u201d Lego said that best-sellers in the first half of the year included \u201chomegrown classics\u201d such as Lego City and Lego Friends, while the Lego Batman movie products also performed well.",

Unfortunately, it is essential for us to make these tough decisions.\u201d<br></p> <p>Lego is based in Billund, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/denmark\">Denmark</a>, and and is still controlled by the founding Kristensen family, which has a 75% stake. It has five main office hubs, in Billund, Enfield in the US, London, Singapore, and Shanghai. It also has factories in Mexico, Hungary, Czech Republic, China and Denmark, and employs about 900 people in the UK.</p> <p>Revenue fell 6% in the first half of 2017 to 14.9bn Danish krone (\u00a31.8bn), while net profit was down 3% at 3.4bn Danish krone. It was the first fall in sales since 2004 - a year after the maker of plastic bricks almost collapsed.</p> <p>Knudstorp said that despite double-digit growth in China in the first half of the year, \u201cwe are disappointed by the decline in revenue in our established markets, and we have taken steps to address this\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are working closely with our partners and we are confident that we have the long-term potential of reaching more children in our well-established markets in Europe and the United States. We also see strong growth opportunities in growing markets such as China.\u201d</p> <p>He said the business was suffering from an overly complex structure that resulted from rapid growth over the past five years. Knudstorp was chief executive for most of the period.</p> <p>\u201cIn the process, we have added complexity into the organisation which now in turn makes it harder for us to grow further. As a result, we have now pressed the reset-button for the entire group. </p> <p>\u201cThis means we will build a smaller and less complex organisation than we have today, which will simplify our business model in order to reach more children. It will also impact our costs. Finally, in some markets the reset entails addressing a clean-up of inventories across the entire value chain. The work is well under way.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/10/lego-bali-padda-british-niels-christiansen\">Lego last month replaced its British chief executive,</a> the first non-Danish person to run the toy company, after just eight months. The company said that at 61, Bali Padda was never expected to be in the position long term and said that the decision was not down to performance.</p> <p>The company had enjoyed a decade of growth, helped by franchise deals based on Hollywood films such as Star Wars, Harry Potter and Indiana Jones, and the introduction of the Lego Friends range aimed at girls. Success continued with the launch of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/13/the-lego-movie-review\">The Lego Movie</a> in 2014.</p> <p>Lou Ellerton, associate director at the brand consultancy Mash, said Lego had over-extended its product offering, partly because it has licensed so many popular brands, and was operating in a competitive environment.</p> <p>\u201cLego has tripled its workforce and more than tripled the number of lines they offer [over recent years]. Realistically there is a limit to how much people can buy at any one time. There has been so much licensing they are over-extended.\u201d</p> <p>Ellerton said there were rival, cheaper products available that might not have the famous licensed names but were essentially toy building blocks. \u201cParents are becoming much more conscious of value for money on toys,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Frederique Tutt, a global toy industry analyst at the consumer research group NPD, said that despite the sales dip, Lego was the number one manufacturer in terms of toy sales in Europe and in the UK in 2017 so far.</p> <p>\u201cLego\u2019s pole position with toy buyers is proof of its universal appeal,\u201d Tutt said. \u201cThe brand has innovated year after year and built up a loyal fan base, enabling it to compete effectively in a thriving toy market.\u201d</p> <p>Lego said that best-sellers in the first half of the year included \u201chomegrown classics\u201d such as Lego City and Lego Friends, while the Lego Batman movie products also performed well.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bell Pottinger\u2019s history of chequered clients Lord Bell, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s favourite PR man when she was prime minister, co-founded Bell Pottinger in 1987. The agency has standard corporate clients, such as the construction group Carillion and the car dealership Lookers, but over the past three decades it has also taken on highly sensitive geo-political PR accounts and other controversial clients. These include the Pinochet Foundation; Syria\u2019s first lady, Asma al-Assad; the governments of Bahrain and Egypt; Oscar Pistorius, after he was charged with murder; FW de Klerk, when he ran against Nelson Mandela for president; and Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian dictator. It also emerged last year that Bell Pottinger had been paid \u00a3500m to make propaganda videos in Iraq on behalf of the US government. They included short news segments made to look like Arabic news networks and fake insurgent videos. Key players in the South Africa scandal The Guptas and the Zumas - the Zuptas The wealthy, powerful and controversial Guptas have been described as \u201cthe most hated family in South Africa\u201d. The Gupta brothers moved from India to South Africa in 1993 and developed a very close relationship with Jacob Zuma and his family, becoming billionaires along the way. They have been widely accused of using ties to Zuma to influence government decisions. Zuma\u2019s son, Duduzane, has been a director of several Gupta-owned companies as well as working for Oakbay, the business at the centre of the scandal. The Guptas started out with a computer business, but over 25 years have developed a conglomerate that includes coal and uranium mines, air travel, energy and manufacturing, a TV station and a national newspaper. Victoria Geoghegan The 34-year-old was Bell Pottinger\u2019s partner leading the Gupta account. Geoghegan met Duduzane Zuma to discuss and ultimately run what would ultimately become the \u201ceconomic emancipation\u201d campaign. As the scandal escalated a Facebook campaign with pictures of her and the word \u201cwanted\u201d appeared. Geoghegan was a high flyer at the firm she joined 12 years ago. As recently as December she was still rapidly climbing the corporate ladder, being appointed managing director of Bell Pottinger\u2019s financial and corporate division. She resigned from Bell Pottinger on 6 July, when she was seven months pregnant and due to go on maternity leave. The same day the PR agency issued an \u201cunequivocal and absolute\u201d apology for the campaign. James Henderson Henderson was one of the engineers of the \u00a320m management buyout of the Bell Pottinger PR business from parent company Chime, alongside Lord Bell, when it was taken over by WPP and the US equity firm Providence Equity Partners in 2012. He took the role of chief executive and is the largest individual shareholder in the PR business. He maintains he knew nothing about the South Africa campaign, but stood down on Sunday, saying that \u201cas chief executive I have ultimate executive responsibility for Bell Pottinger\u201d. Lord Bell Bell left the PR agency that carries his name last summer. He has since said that one of the reasons he decided to leave was his unease over the Oakbay account. Bellsaid his warnings that the Gupta account was \u201csmelly\u201d were ignored by senior management he told, including Henderson. The agency has reportedly denied he voiced his concerns. Ever the risk-taker, when Bell quit the firm last year he immediately set up a new business called Sans Frontieres, the same name as the arm of Bell Pottinger that handled sometimes controversial geo-political work.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British manufacturers and retailers are reporting an upswing in sales, despite fears Brexit could hamper future growth, as the weak pound bolsters exports abroad and consumer spending at home. Retail sales increased by 1.3% on a like-for-like basis last month from August 2016, when they fell 0.9%, according to the British Retail Consortium. Meanwhile the EEF manufacturers\u2019 organisation said there was rising demand for goods made in Britain from Europe and the rest of the world. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: \u201cAugust provided a welcome pick-up in retail sales across channels, with non-food returning to growth as shoppers\u2019 attentions turned to homewares, autumn clothing ranges and the new school term.\u201d Over the three months to August, food sales increased 1.8% on a like-for-like basis, as growth in other sales increased 0.6%. Children\u2019s clothing helped drive the growth in non-food sales as school\u2019s return from the summer break, while the rising trend for staycations after a drop in the value of sterling strengthened home improvement sales. However, the healthy retail figures obscure the fact that food sales are growing only as a consequence of rising prices, as the overall number of products sold was weaker than last year. Non-food sales have recently recovered to levels seen two years ago, after a dismal August in 2016. There was also weak growth in retail sales in July, according to the Office for National Statistics. The slump in the pound \u2013 by more than 16% since the EU referendum last summer \u2013 has led to higher prices on the high street as the cost of goods imported from overseas increases on a relative basis. That has pushed inflation to 2.6%, outstripping the growth in earnings and putting pressure on household spending. The weakness in sterling is a shot in the arm for manufacturers, as goods made in Britain become cheaper for buyers overseas. A poll of 416 companies by the EEF found an improving eurozone economy was leading to more export orders in the three months to the end of September. The survey found the balance of firms reporting an increase in export orders has mounted to 33%, from a drop of 2% in the final three months of 2016. Factory gate output and future orders were found to be in positive territory, lifted by demand at home and abroad. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, said: \u201cExporting companies are capitalising on growth in the world economy \u2013 Europe in particular. That\u2019s encouraging buyers of manufactured goods everywhere, and UK is helping those supply chains, helped by the weak pound.\u201d Economic confidence is at its highest level in a decade in the eurozone, where GDP is growing at twice the rate of the UK at 0.6%. The European commission\u2019s measure of sentiment increased to 111.9 in August, its highest since July 2007, just before the financial crisis. Despite positive signals from recent surveys, manufacturers\u2019 contribution to GDP growth has proved elusive in recent months. Output from the industry fell by 0.6% in the second quarter, according to the ONS, having only expanded by 0.3% in the first three months of the year. Manufacturers\u2019 investment plans are also failing to keep pace with their order books, as uncertainty over Brexit discourages them from putting money into their operations. Hopley said uncertainty over Brexit could hit firms over the next 12 months. \u201cIt is vital the government sends a signal to industry and investors in the UK and overseas that it is doing everything in its power to get growth of the UK economy back on the agenda,\u201d she said.",

A poll of 416 companies by the EEF found an improving eurozone economy was leading to more export orders in the three months to the end of September. </p> <p>The survey found the balance of firms reporting an increase in export orders has mounted to 33%, from a drop of 2% in the final three months of 2016. Factory gate output and future orders were found to be in positive territory, lifted by demand at home and abroad. </p> <p>Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, said: \u201cExporting companies are capitalising on growth in the world economy \u2013 Europe in particular. That\u2019s encouraging buyers of manufactured goods everywhere, and UK is helping those supply chains, helped by the weak pound.\u201d</p> <p>Economic confidence is at its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/03/brexit-as-the-uk-economy-sputters-its-all-systems-go-in-the-eurozone\">highest level in a decade in the eurozone,</a> where GDP is growing at twice the rate of the UK at 0.6%. The European commission\u2019s measure of sentiment increased to 111.9 in August, its highest since July 2007, just before the financial crisis.</p> <p>Despite positive signals from recent surveys, manufacturers\u2019 contribution to GDP growth has proved elusive in recent months. Output from the industry fell by 0.6% in the second quarter, according to the ONS, having only expanded by 0.3% in the first three months of the year.</p> <p>Manufacturers\u2019 investment plans are also failing to keep pace with their order books, as uncertainty over Brexit discourages them from putting money into their operations. </p> <p>Hopley said uncertainty over Brexit could hit firms over the next 12 months. \u201cIt is vital the government sends a signal to industry and investors in the UK and overseas that it is doing everything in its power to get growth of the UK economy back on the agenda,\u201d she said. </p>",
