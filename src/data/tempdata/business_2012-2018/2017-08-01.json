      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy will surge back to life in the next six months following its slow start this year, a leading forecaster has predicted, prompting the Bank of England to raise interest rates next spring \u2013 more than a year earlier than its previous projection. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said a boom in exports after the fall in the pound and a return to bumper wage rises next year would be enough to increase GDP growth to almost 2% and convince the central bank to increase the cost of borrowing. Jagjit Chadha, the institute\u2019s director, said a rise interest rates would also have the effect of supporting efforts by high street banks to boost their profits and the reserves needed to protect them against another financial crash. \u201cWe are not talking about a rapid return to higher interest rates, but signalling that process \u2013 even if it takes five to seven years \u2013 will help banks rebuild their balance sheets and create a healthier financial system,\u201d he said. In a separate report, Chadha said one of the main reasons for the UK\u2019s slow growth in recent years was the weakness of the banking sector and its ability to support expanding businesses with extra loans. \u201cThe finance sector is crucial because every business has to go to a bank to put forward their business plan and get credit,\u201d he added. NIESR\u2019s forecast comes despite growing concerns that Brexit uncertainty is discouraging companies from investing in the UK and hampering a bounce-back from low growth in the first six months. While foreign firms have bought high-profile properties in the UK since the Brexit vote, including last month\u2019s \u00a31.2bn purchase of the Walkie Talkie building in London, there are few examples of increased investment in new factories. Official figures last week showed that GDP growth was 0.3% in the three months to the end of June \u2013 half the rate of growth in the eurozone \u2013 after a rise of 0.2% in the first quarter. Philip Hammond has also said he was concerned about the decline in household incomes in the last year after a rise in inflation of 2.7% while wages growth remained stuck at about 2%. The chancellor is understood to be scaling back government tax receipts in the light of stumbling GDP growth and pushing back the date when he can balance the government\u2019s books from 2025 to 2027. Later this week, the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate setting committee will give its own verdict on the strength of the economy in its quarterly inflation report. It is expected to present a gloomier outlook for the economy than NIESR after the economy failed to rebound from a weak start to the year. The Bank of England\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, shocked financial markets in June when he warned that continued growth in the UK economy would eventually lead to higher interest rates, but is not expected to say this week that it will come as early as next spring. After the Brexit vote, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee cut the base rate as an emergency measure from 0.5% to 0.25%, its lowest level in the Bank\u2019s 323-year history. Carney is likely to highlight how wages have failed to keep pace with rising prices, hitting real incomes and consumer spending. As one economic consultancy said this week: \u201cThe criteria set out by the governor to justify a hike look a long way from being met.\u201d NIESR said it was bringing forward the timing of the first increase in interest rates to the first quarter of next year following its more upbeat assessment of the next six months. Previously it forecast that a rate rise would take place after the second quarter of 2019, when Britain had left the European Union. A rise in business investment and productivity would spur a broad-based recovery that would allow the central bank to at least reverse the emergency cut last August. It said: \u201cThis rate increase should not be seen as a tightening in policy, but instead as a modest withdrawal of some of the additional stimulus that was injected into the economy after the 2016 EU referendum.\u201d Chadha accused the Bank of England of confusing the public about the next move in interest rates, saying that a series of speeches by the governor and other members of the MPC \u201cfostered a haphazard debate\u201d, when clarity was needed. \u201cThat is why we have called for a proper debate to start now in a careful, considered and open manner,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Are you outraged that British Gas is hiking the price of its electricity by 12.5%? Maybe you are, but nobody who follows the energy market can claim to be surprised by it. Parent company Centrica signalled its move months ago and delayed implementation only because of the approach of the general election in May. Centrica was never going to allow its main dual fuel tariff to be notably cheaper than most of its rivals indefinitely. Even after the increase, the company can claim its prices are near the bottom of the range among big suppliers. Save your fury instead for the government\u2019s response. It was yet another irritating attempt to sympathise with consumers while committing ministers to doing precisely nothing. Here, for the record, is the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\u2019s view: \u201cEnergy firms should treat all their customers fairly and we\u2019re concerned this price rise will hit many people already on poor-value tariffs. We are not ruling anything out \u2013 whether it is action by the regulator or legislation \u2013 to increase fairness for customers.\u201d Not ruling anything out? Before the election, Theresa May was championing the policies she was ruling in. The prime minister was going to \u201cprotect around 17 million families on standard variable tariffs\u201d by knocking \u00a3100 off their energy bills every year. That ambition has been killed by opposition on Tory benches to price caps. Thus the whole issue has been booted off to the regulator Ofgem, which will probably only back a limited \u201csafeguard tariff\u201d for customers on warm home discounts. At that point, the ball will be back in the government\u2019s court and ministers will have to think of a new excuse for inaction. They\u2019ll find something. If the government was truly serious about being radical, it would have disputed one or both of Centrica\u2019s justifications for its price hike. The first was that 5% is a fair profit margin for an energy supply business (supermarkets survive on half that level, by the way). The second was that its increased costs flow directly from factors beyond its control, including regulated distribution charges and subsidies to support windfarms and solar projects. The business department avoided such nitty-gritty details. Tune in at the next election for the next round of empty political promises. AA\u2019s communication breakdown If you are a public company and you fire your executive chairman for \u201cgross misconduct\u201d surely you should be obliged to say what he is supposed to have done. Shareholders in the AA could not reasonably expect full chapter and verse on Bob Mackenzie\u2019s alleged misdeeds but they are entitled to know more than the simple fact of instant dismissal. Could the alleged misconduct affect the company\u2019s reputation? This, after all, is a company that boasts about \u201cvery favourable perceptions of what we do\u201d. How was the behaviour discovered? Does it imply failure of internal controls? Are there outstanding legal issues? To put it mildly, the situation is unusual. But the AA can\u2019t expect shareholders to be satisfied with silence. They are the owners of the company and Mackenzie has been the most senior executive for the past three years. Within obvious legal constraints, the owners are entitled to know more. A sweeping statement of confidence in the company\u2019s long-term prospects is not enough. Berkeley bosses\u2019 pay is a lottery Can it really cost \u00a392m to run housebuilder Berkeley Homes\u2019 boardroom for a year? Well yes, it did. There was \u00a329m for the chairman and founder, Tony Pidgley; \u00a328m for the chief executive, Rob Perrins; \u00a312.7m for the executive director, Sean Ellis; and so it goes on. The previous year\u2019s tally for the six-strong crew was \u00a347m, so the latest bounty cannot be described as exceptional. It\u2019s just what can happen when directors are granted huge share-based incentive awards at the bottom of the housing cycle. These big payouts are related to schemes designed in 2009 and 2011. Berkeley has the numbers to show it has achieved every performance condition, including best-in-class returns on capital. It is also easily on course to meet the original 2011 goal of paying \u00a31.7bn in dividends to shareholders over the course of a decade. It would be churlish not to admit it is a well-managed business that has been an excellent investment. All the same, the directors have also enjoyed luck beyond their dreams in the form of a buoyant housing market, especially in its London and south-east heartland, and George Osborne\u2019s help to buy wheeze. They seemed to acknowledge as much when they agreed that, over the course of the remaining period of the 10-year 2011 scheme, the value of their collective pot would be reduced from \u00a3300m to \u201conly\u201d \u00a3150m. When you\u2019ve won a lottery, you can afford to leave \u00a3150m on the table. But incentive schemes with lottery-like features are a nonsense.",

Given the political focus from Bill Shorten on inequality, the release of the annual Hilda survey, which has been tracking the social and economic situation of Australian households since 2001, was always going to be used as ammunition by either side. The good news from the Hilda report is that income inequality does not seem to be getting worse. The report\u2019s calculation of the annual Gini coefficient, which records income inequality, fell slightly in 2015 and is essentially around where it has been since 2001. But the Hilda survey also measures income inequality over five year periods \u2013 to get more of a sense of ongoing inequality. On this score, inequality has been rising slightly since 2001: It reflects as well the situation that income mobility in Australia is declining. The report shows that there has been a clear increase in the trend of people remaining in the same income level they were in previous years: While this might sound good, it is only so if you already have a good income. Increased income stability (and thus decreased mobility) \u201cis not a good development for people with low incomes, since they are more likely to have persistently low incomes.\u201d The Hilda report also highlights the complete lack of improvement in household incomes since the GFC. In 2009, the median household disposable income in Australia was $77,411 (in 2015 dollars) \u2013 that was 30% higher than it had been six years earlier. But in the six years from 2009 to 2015, median household incomes actually fell 1.5% to $76,225: Flat-lining real household incomes is a major concern \u2013 especially given the continuing record low wage growth we are experiencing. Just last week the governor of the Reserve Bank, Phillip Lowe, suggested that workers were becoming used to low wage rises and that he believed that such a situation \u201cis going to be sustained for quite some time\u201d. Now clearly we are not in such poor straits as has been observed in the US, where even with recent improvements, real median incomes have been flat for nearly 20 years. But the US is a cautionary tale. Flat median incomes might not mean growing inequality, but it is a situation that does not lend itself to good economic times. As governor Lowe noted, \u201cif people feel like their wages aren\u2019t growing anymore, they don\u2019t want to spend when they get paid\u201d: The Hilda report also allows us to gauge what exactly is the median income for Australian households. The report provides the average and median \u201cequivalised\u201d disposable income. Equivalised income is essentially a figure that enables you to adjust for household size by applying a weighting for each extra adult (50%) and child under 15 (30%) in a household to the original income figure for a single person. The Hilda calculates that the median disposable income for a single person in 2015 was $46,007. This means the median disposable household income for a family of four would be $96,615: Using a standard 70/30 income split of the two adults, this would suggest the two adults earn roughly a combined $120,000 before tax. It is also worth noting that the treasurer justified the raising of the threshold for the 37% income tax bracket from $80,000 to $87,000 to ensure \u201cmiddle income Australians, those that are on average full-time earnings \u2026 don\u2019t move into the second top tax bracket\u201d. But with a median equivalised income of just $46,007, the median before tax income for a single person would be around just $56,000. And while the report might suggest income inequality is not rising, the disparity in wealth across Australians is starkly apparent. The report finds that home ownership among those aged under 40 has plummeted since 2002, with the current housing boom in Sydney having a massive impact. In all capital cities except Canberra, the percentage of people under 40 who owned a home in 2014 was lower than it was in 2002. In Sydney the impact of the surge in housing prices since 2012 is unmistakable. In 2012, 31% of those aged 18-39 living in Sydney owned a home; by 2014 it was just 20%: The problem is not isolated in Sydney. In Melbourne, home ownership rates for those under 40 have fallen from 36% in 2002 to just 21% in 2012. Even in Adelaide, generally seen as one of the better cities for housing affordability, home ownership rates for under 40s has gone from 35% to 25% in the dozen years from 2002. In the same time the economic differences between home owners and non-home owners have widened. In 2002, the average income of a home owner aged under 40 was $65,845 \u2013 some 79% higher than the $36,857 earned by the average non-home owner. But by 2014, the average earnings of home owners had risen 32% to $87,182, while the earnings of non-homers had risen just 13% to $41,810: The report also finds that home-ownership for under 40s has declined across all income levels, but most starkly for those in the poorest 40%: In 2002, 19% of those in the bottom income quintile were home owner \u2013 this fell by a third to 12.8% in 2012. But for those in the second income quintile the fall was even more drastic. In 2002, 37% of such income earners owned a home, by 2012 that had more than halved to just 17%. The Hilda report highlights that while it is all very well to split hairs about short-term movements of income inequality measures like the Gini coefficient, for median income households income has now stalled for six years. It also highlights that while income inequality may have stabilised, the ability to use that income to build wealth has drastically changed. The report provides damning evidence that inequality across generations has increased \u2013 with those under 40 now much less able to buy a home than were young people in previous years. With continuing flat median income growth and a widening disparity between the incomes of those who are in the housing market and those out of it, the problem of inequality will rightly remain a major political issue.",

      "bodyText": "The AA has fired its boss, Bob Mackenzie, for \u201cgross misconduct\u201d, with immediate effect, wiping nearly a fifth off the value of the company and making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 250. \u201cBob Mackenzie has been removed by the board from his role as executive chairman, from his other roles and as a director and as an employee of the company, for gross misconduct,\u201d the AA said. A spokesperson for the roadside repair company said the sacking was a \u201cpersonal conduct related matter\u201d, but gave no further details. It is not believed to involve fraud. However, a statement attributed by the Times to Mackenzie\u2019s son, Peter Mackenzie, said his father had a serious health issue and had resigned. The statement said his father had tendered his resignation and resigned his directorships due to acute ill health. \u201cHe is very unwell and has been admitted to hospital,\u201d it said. \u201cThe family trusts that all parties will act responsibly towards a loyal servant of the company in a manner which reflects the stress he has been suffering.\u201d The company declined to comment beyond its initial statement. The shock announcement sent shares down as much as 18% at one point. The shares closed down 14%, wiping about \u00a3200m off the value of the company. Mackenzie, 65, has been executive chairman of the AA since 2014, when he was instrumental in a stock market flotation of the company. His previous roles include chairman and chief executive of National Car Parks and its subsidiary Green Flag, a rival car breakdown business. The AA said Mackenzie\u2019s responsibilities would be split, with Simon Breakwell, a non-executive director since 2014 and a founder of the travel company Expedia, appointed as acting chief executive. John Leach, who was senior independent director, has been appointed as chairman. The company had already announced plans to split the combined roles of executive chairman, with the aim of appointing a chief executive. In a trading update published alongside the announcement of Mackenzie\u2019s departure, the AA said it was confident about the company\u2019s long-term prospects but its financial performance in the first half of 2017 had been hit by a number of factors. \u201cThe financial performance in the first six months has been negatively impacted by the effect of erratic work load patterns on an inherently fixed cost base. This was especially true in June and July which saw significant spikes in demand. \u201cWe now expect the full-year performance to be broadly in line with that of the last financial year.\u201d The AA said paid members totalled 3.33 million in the first six months of the year, an increase of 6,000 compared with the same period a year earlier. The company would publish first-half results on 26 September. \u201cAt that stage, Simon Breakwell will be in a position to provide an update on our plans,\u201d the company said. Analysts at Liberum noted their surprise at Mackenzie\u2019s departure, adding that they \u201cdo not believe that it is fraud-related\u201d. They revised down their expectations for full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by 3% to \u00a3403m, but said the company had made progress in some areas. \u201cAfter the accelerated [stock market listing] in July 2014, management had acquired a strategic asset akin to a desirable residence in Mayfair, where the plumbing and electrics were in need of investment,\u201d the Liberum analysts said. \u201cWe now believe that the face-lift is largely complete. \u201cSome of the key metrics are generally encouraging, although that may be lost today. The transformation may have taken longer but there is tangible evidence of improvement.\u201d The AA said that existing board member Andrew Blowers would replace John Leach as senior independent director, while Martin Clarke continues as finance director.",

    "webTitle": "Eurozone grows twice as fast as UK after GDP rises by 0.6% - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap on today\u2019s eurozone growth figures, from my colleague Katie Allen: The eurozone economy has grown twice as fast as the UK in recent months, according to official figures that underscore the divergence between Britain and its neighbouring currency bloc after the Brexit vote. GDP in the 19 countries that use the euro expanded 0.6% in the second quarter of 2017, building on growth of 0.5% in the first quarter, according the EU statistics body Eurostat (pdf). In the UK by contrast, the latest official figures released last week showed the economy grew by just 0.3% in the second quarter of 2017 following 0.2% expansion in the first three months of the year. The economy had shown resilience in the immediate aftermath of last year\u2019s EU referendum, confounding forecasts of a downturn. But growth has slowed markedly since the turn of the year as a weaker pound has raised the cost of imports, pushed up inflation and squeezed consumers. In the eurozone, growth has quickened and unemployment has fallen against the backdrop of ultra-low interest rates and other measures by the European Central Bank (ECB) to boost activity. Eurostat said second-quarter GDP was up 2.1% compared with a year earlier, the fastest growth since 2011 and in line with forecasts by economists in a Reuters poll. Bert Colijn, a senior eurozone economist at the bank ING, said the bloc had enjoyed a \u201csurprisingly strong\u201d first half to 2017. Eurostat did not provide any detail about what had driven growth in Tuesday\u2019s early estimate of GDP but Colijn said domestic demand continued to be an important factor. He added: \u201cSome countries have already released their first estimates of second-quarter GDP growth, showing that the expansion is broad-based within the eurozone. France, Spain, Austria and Belgium all recorded solid growth rates.\u201d \u201cAll in all, the eurozone economy has rounded out the first half of the year in a very healthy state and seems to be set up nicely for continued firm growth for the rest of 2017.\u201d... Here\u2019s the full story: And that\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading, and for all the comments. GW Newsflash: America\u2019s manufacturing sector has slowed a little, and the nation\u2019s builders have been hit by falling spending too. The ISM survey of the US factory sector dipped to 56.3 for July, down from 57.8 in June. That still shows growth, but at a slower rate. A separate report shows that US construction spending fell by 1.3% in June, dashing hopes of a small rise. That\u2019s due to a 5.4% tumble in public spending on building projects; a reminder that America hasn\u2019t launched the massive infrastructure spending programme promised by Donald Trump..... Today\u2019s growth figures could signal that 2017 will be a vintage year for the eurozone, says IHS Markit\u2019s Raj Badiani. He says that the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus programme, which runs until at least the end of December, should support the economy. But, he also suspects growth will slow next year, as Britain moves closer to the EU exit door. Plus, there\u2019s always the chance of a political crisis blowing up on the continent. Badiani writes: Eurozone political uncertainties have been diluted by Macron\u2019s convincing win in the French presidential election and the defeat of the populist Freedom party in the Dutch elections, although they have not disappeared. Further uncertainty comes from the German election in September (although Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union party is currently riding high in opinion polls), and a 2017 election is very possible in Italy following Matteo Renzi\u2019s December defeat in a referendum on constitutional reform. Additionally, although a third general election has been avoided in Spain, the minority government seems certain to find life difficult. We also suspect the Brexit vote could further damage Eurozone activity in 2017 and 2018, now that the United Kingdom has triggered Article 50 (on 29 March), and its exit negotiations with the EU are under way. On balance, Eurozone GDP growth is seen improving from 1.7% in 2016 to 2.0% in 2017 before easing back to 1.9% in 2018. Growth should be helped by reduced political uncertainty, assuming no major shocks occur during 2017. Boom! The US stock market rally has driven the Dow Jones industrial average to a new record high. As the chimes of the opening trading bell fade away, the Dow jumped by 94 points to 21,985 points. That\u2019s just 15 points shy of the 22,000 milestone which Donald Trump was aiming for.... Today\u2019s eurozone GDP figures have helped to keep shares buoyant in Europe today. The main indices are all up today, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, Germany\u2019s DAX and the French CAC all up around 0.8%. Wall Street is expected to rally today too, and the Dow Jones could hit a new all-time high over 22,000 points. The president of the US hopes we\u2019re paying attention.... Although Britain is lagging behind the eurozone this year, it has still done better overall in the 10 years since the financial crisis. Ben Chu of the Independent has the details: That\u2019s partly because the Bank of England was quicker to ease monetary policy, slash interest rates to record lows, and start a quantitative easing stimulus scheme. This chart, from last week\u2019s UK GDP report, shows how the UK and Germany have basically grown at the same rate since 2007, behind Canada, but much faster than France or Italy. Robert Ward of the Economist Intelligence Unit says Europe\u2019s brisk growth is overshadowing Britain right now.... Thanks to today\u2019s robust data, the eurozone has now posted 17 quarters of growth in a row. This expansion dates back to early 2013, during the debt crisis which gripped the continent for years. The previous autumn, the European Central Bank had finally woken up to the challenge, and promised to buy the debt of countries such as Spain and Italy in \u2018unlimited quantities\u2019. Although never acted on, that pledge helped to calm worries that the eurozone might break up, and paved the way for the recovery. Europe\u2019s employment commissioner, Marianne Thyssen, tweets: But Angel Talavera of Oxford Economics suggest the eurozone could have done even better.... We don\u2019t yet know how Europe\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, performed in the last quarter. Economists expect solid growth, following Germany\u2019s 0.6% expansion in the first three months of the year. It\u2019s even possible that a strong performance from Germany could push up the eurozone growth rate to 0.7%. Jack Allen of Capital Economics explains: German Q2 GDP has not yet been published, and the euro-zone aggregate has been produced using an estimate for Germany. Given that the monthly data in Germany point to a very sharp acceleration in growth there, to as much as 1%, the euro-zone aggregate may yet be revised up. And the timelier surveys point to continued strong growth at the start of Q3. On an annual basis, the eurozone is now growing at the fastest pace since 2011. That underlines how its economy has strengthened in the last year. Bert Colijn, senior economist at ING, says the eurozone is in a \u201cvery healthy state\u201d right now, after growing by over 1% since the start of the year. Colijn expects further growth in 2017, following a \u201csurprisingly strong first half to 2017\u201d. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s GDP figures: No breakdowns for Eurozone GDP have been released so far, but domestic demand continues to be an important driver of growth. Especially the recovery in investments has been strong over recent quarters and has likely continued to boost GDP growth in the second quarter. The same holds good for consumption, albeit at a somewhat slower pace. On the back of an accelerating jobs recovery and the highest consumer confidence since 2001, consumption is likely to have contributed significantly to growth as well. The recent appreciation of the euro is therefore unlikely to slow the current expansion significantly for the moment, given the domestic strength of the economy. Eurozone policymakers will be cheered by today\u2019s growth figures, says Mehreen Khan of the FT: The health of the eurozone economy has confounded critics this year after a series of electoral setbacks for eurosceptic parties in the Netherlands, Austria, and France has boosted business and consumer confidence. The economy has now expanded for 17 consecutive quarters and unemployment \u2013 long a scourge of the bloc\u2019s weakest economies- \u2013 is now at a nine-year low 0f 9.1%. This chart shows how the eurozone has outpaced Britain in the last six months, after lagging behind in 2016. It\u2019s official! The eurozone grew twice as fast as the UK in the second quarter of 2017, as its recovery gathers pace. Eurozone GDP rose by 0.6% in the three months to June, new figures from Eurostat show. That\u2019s a pretty decent growth rate, as the region puts its debt crisis behind it. This is an acceleration on the first quarter, when eurozone rose by 0.5% (that\u2019s been revised down from 0.6%). On an annual basis, the eurozone GDP expanded by 2.3% during the quarter. That\u2019s underlines how the region has strengthened in recent months, driving unemployment down to a nine-year low. In contrast, Britain\u2019s economy only grew by 0.3% in April-to-June, and 0.2% in Q1, as subdued consumer spending and rising inflation hit growth. Figures released last Friday showed that France grew up 0.5% in the last quarter, while Spain achieved 0.9% growth and Sweden stormed ahead with 1.7% growth. More to follow.... The pound has hit a 10-month high against the US dollar, at $1.3235. The pick-up in UK factory growth is boosting sterling. Meanwhile, traders are shunning the dollar as the crisis at the White House continues to escalate with Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s shock sacking last night. Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, has welcomed the recovery in UK factory growth last month:: \u201cFirms are facing uncertainty around the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU but figures suggest exports are rising with a year-on-year increase of 15 per cent. This is partly a result of the weaker pound but also because more manufacturers are looking at new international markets beyond Europe. \u201cThe news that BMW is planning to build the new electronic Mini at its plant in Oxfordshire is a timely vote of confidence in our industry\u2019s word-class expertise. \u201cManufacturers are planning positively for the future with continued investment, product development and new business at home and away.\u201d Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, reckons factories should contribute to growth this quarter. \u201cUK manufacturers appear to be riding high going into the second half of the year with the sector in the UK and Europe continuing to be buoyed by a recovering global economy, alongside efforts to bring new products to the market. Above trend responses across the key components of the survey would signal that the drag on overall economic growth from the sector in the second quarter of this year is likely to be temporary. Boom! UK manufacturing has bounced back from its slowdown in June, thanks to a surge in new exports, according to data firm Markit. Markit\u2019s UK factory PMI jumped to 55.1 in July, up from the three-month low of 54.2 in June. This was driven by foreign demand for UK goods, which rose by the fastest rate since the all-time record in April 2010. This came from clients in North America, Europe, the Asia- Pacific region and the Middle-East. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, says UK manufacturing has started the third quarter of 2017 on \u201ca solid footing\u201d. The headline PMI signalled a growth acceleration for the first time in three months during July, as new order intakes were boosted by a near survey-record increase in new export business. Although the exchange rate remains a key driver of export growth, manufacturers also benefitted from stronger economic growth in key markets in the euro area, North America and Asia-Pacific regions. \u201cContinued expansion is also still filtering through to the labour market, with the latest round of manufacturing job creation among the best seen over the past three years. However, there is a caveat! Markit\u2019s data is more upbeat than the official data from the Office for National Statistics, which showed that manufacturing shrank in April to June..... Newsflash: Growth across the eurozone\u2019s factory sector slowed last month, but remains strong. Markit\u2019s overall healthcheck on manufacturers across the euro area came in at 56.6, down from the 74-month high of 57.4 hit in June. This is the 49th month running in which the factory PMI has come in over 50 points, indicating that the sector has now grown for over four years running. Encouragingly, the expansion seems to be widespread. Every individual country tracked by Markit reported factory growth, including Greece! Output growth dipped to a six month low, new orders grew at their slowest in five months, and new export growth was a four-month low. But all these readings were close to the best since 2011. As this chart shows, there are signs of a slowdown in some countries. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says eurozone factories were \u201cbuzzing with activity\u201d in July. The PMI came in slightly below the earlier flash estimate, slipping to a four-month low, but this is still an encouragingly buoyant reading. The survey indicates that manufacturing output was growing at an annual rate of approximately 4% at the start of the third quarter, sustaining the best growth spell that the region has seen for six years. \u201cGermany clearly remains a major driver of the upturn, with only neighbouring Austria and the Netherlands enjoying faster rates of expansion. But this is a broad-based revival nonetheless, with even Greece enjoying its first back-to-back monthly improvement in manufacturing conditions for three years. \u201cEmployment growth meanwhile continued to run at one of the highest rates seen for at least 20 years, with the hiring boom underscoring the current ebullient mood within euro area factories. \u201cDespite the near-record rise in employment, companies continued to struggle to meet order book growth, with capacity constraints both at factories and their suppliers becoming increasingly widespread in recent months. While price pressures eased in July, inflationary pressures could pick up again if demand continues to outstrip supply.\u201d Germany\u2019s factory sector seems to have cooled a little in July. The German manufacturing PMI fell to 58.1 in July, down from 59.6 in June. That\u2019s still a very high reading, soaring over the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. But it does show that output, new orders and job creation all softened. Trevor Balchin, Director, Economics at IHS Markit says: \u201cThe German manufacturing sector finally gave up some momentum in July, with the PMI easing to a five-month low of 58.1. This was still indicative of marked overall growth, however, with rates of expansion for output, new orders and jobs remaining historically sharp. Supply chains in particular were kept under intense pressure at the start of the second half of 2017. The French recovery is alive and well! Firms took on staff at the fastest rate in 17 years, and optimism over future prospects hit a record high. This pushed France\u2019s manufacturing PMI up to 54.9 in July, from 54.8 in June. Italy\u2019s factories had a decent July, with new orders accelerating but output growth slowing a little. They kept hiring workers too, according to Markit\u2019s PMI, but with the slowest increase in nine months. Spain\u2019s factory sector cooled a little last month, but is still growing: Factories in the Netherlands helped drive the eurozone recovery in July. The Dutch manufacturing PMI has climbed to 58.9 in July, up from June\u2019s 58.6 and its highest reading since April 2011. New orders, output and employment levels all surged, suggesting that the sector strengthened last month. Over in the City, shares in Rolls-Royce have surged over 5% after reporting better-than-expected earnings. Underlying profits at the engineering firm jumped to \u00a3287m for the last six months, up from \u00a3104m a year ago. Strong sales of Rolls\u2019 Trent engines helped it recover from the huge bribery scandal that rocked the firm. Millions of British Gas customers have woken up to the bad news that their energy bills are going up. It\u2019s a big rise too! Centrica is hiking its electricity prices by 12.5% but left gas prices unchanged. This means the average dual fuel bill will rise by 7.3% to \u00a31,120. More than 3m customers will be hit \u2013 although Centrica will provide a \u00a376 credit to more than 200,000 vulnerable customers to protect them from the increase. Here\u2019s the full story: Centrica boss Iain Conn just faced the music on Sky News, arguing that the rise is driven by \u201cunderlying increases in costs\u201d. Sky\u2019s Sarah-Jane Mee isn\u2019t impressed, though, telling Conn that she\u2019d hoped to read out some of the comments received over social media, but they\u2019re not suitable for a family audience. She adds: \u201cGreedy\u201d is one of the words I can read out..... China got manufacturing PMI day off to a solid start, by posting its best figures in four months. The Caixin China manufacturing PMI for July jumped to 51.1, up from 50.4 in June. Any reading over 50 shows growth, and this also beats City expectations. Factory bosses reported that output and total new orders expanded at the fastest pace since February. In another encouraging sign, new export sales rose at the second-fastest rate for nearly three years. That could bode well for global growth. But.... Chinese manufacturers also shed jobs last month, at the fastest rate in 10 months. That meant that the backlog of unfinished work stacked up.... Dr Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, says the data is encouraging: Operating conditions in the manufacturing sector improved further in July, suggesting the economy\u2019s growth momentum will be sustained. That said, it\u2019s unlikely that financial regulatory tightening will be relaxed.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Is Europe\u2019s recovery on firm foundations? We find out today, when the first estimate of eurozone GDP for the second quarter of 2017 is released. Economists are expecting to see solid growth, with GDP perhaps expanding by 0.6% in April to June. If so, that would broadly match America\u2019s performance, and be twice as fast as Britain. We also discover how the world\u2019s factories fared in July, as data firm Markit rolls out its monthly PMI surveys. They may show that eurozone manufacturing hit a six-year high last month, and that UK growth picked up too. European stock markets are expected to open higher, with the FTSE 100 called up 0.5%. There\u2019s also a blizzard of corporate news; engineering group Rolls-Royce, oil giant BP, housebuilder Taylor Wimpey and energy group Centrica are all reporting results. And over in Threadneedle Street, staff at the Bank of England are starting a three-day strike in a pay dispute.

Further uncertainty comes from the German election in September (although Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union party is currently riding high in opinion polls), and a 2017 election is very possible in Italy following Matteo Renzi\u2019s December defeat in a referendum on constitutional reform. Additionally, although a third general election has been avoided in Spain, the minority government seems certain to find life difficult. </p> <p>We also suspect the Brexit vote could further damage Eurozone activity in 2017 and 2018, now that the United Kingdom has triggered Article 50 (on 29 March), and its exit negotiations with the EU are under way.</p> <p>On balance, Eurozone GDP growth is seen improving from 1.7% in 2016 to 2.0% in 2017 before easing back to 1.9% in 2018.

      "bodyText": "The eurozone economy has grown twice as fast as the UK in recent months, according to official figures that underscore the divergence between Britain and its neighbouring currency bloc after the Brexit vote. GDP in the 19 countries that use the euro expanded 0.6% in the second quarter of 2017, building on growth of 0.5% in the first quarter, according the EU statistics body Eurostat (pdf). In the UK by contrast, the latest official figures released last week showed the economy grew by just 0.3% in the second quarter of 2017 following 0.2% expansion in the first three months of the year. The economy had shown resilience in the immediate aftermath of last year\u2019s EU referendum, confounding forecasts of a downturn. But growth has slowed markedly since the turn of the year as a weaker pound has raised the cost of imports, pushed up inflation and squeezed consumers. In the eurozone, growth has quickened and unemployment has fallen against the backdrop of ultra-low interest rates and other measures by the European Central Bank (ECB) to boost activity. Eurostat said second-quarter GDP was up 2.1% compared with a year earlier, the fastest growth since 2011 and in line with forecasts by economists in a Reuters poll. Bert Colijn, a senior eurozone economist at the bank ING, said the bloc had enjoyed a \u201csurprisingly strong\u201d first half to 2017. Eurostat did not provide any detail about what had driven growth in Tuesday\u2019s early estimate of GDP but Colijn said domestic demand continued to be an important factor. He added: \u201cSome countries have already released their first estimates of second-quarter GDP growth, showing that the expansion is broad-based within the eurozone. France, Spain, Austria and Belgium all recorded solid growth rates.\u201d \u201cAll in all, the eurozone economy has rounded out the first half of the year in a very healthy state and seems to be set up nicely for continued firm growth for the rest of 2017.\u201d While UK growth was slower over the first half of this year, some business surveys have suggested it could quicken in the second half. The latest check on manufacturing on Tuesday pointed to a rise in activity in July, helped by strong growth in export orders. The headline index on the IHS Markit/CIPS UK manufacturing PMI (pdf) rose to 55.1 in July, from 54.2 in June. The reading was well above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction and beat economists\u2019 forecasts for 54.4. Job creation quickened, production picked up and order books improved, according to the poll of purchasing managers at more than 600 industrial companies. Rob Dobson, an economist at the survey\u2019s compilers, IHS Markit, said it showed UK manufacturing \u2013 which makes up a tenth of the UK economy \u2013 had started the third quarter on a solid footing. He highlighted particularly solid growth in UK exports, which have been made more competitive by the pound\u2019s sharp drop after the Brexit vote and have benefitted from a strengthening global economy. \u201cAlthough the exchange rate remains a key driver of export growth, manufacturers also benefitted from stronger economic growth in key markets in the euro area, North America and Asia-Pacific regions,\u201d Dobson said. \u201cContinued expansion is also still filtering through to the labour market, with the latest round of manufacturing job creation among the best seen over the past three years.\u201d The report will provide more fuel to the debate among policymakers at the Bank of England over when to raise interest rates from their record low of 0.25%. The monetary policy committee meets this week to make its latest decision on borrowing costs and to release new forecasts for the economy. The committee was divided at its last meeting, with three members wanting to increase borrowing costs to curb inflation while the other five preferred to keep them on hold to shore up growth and employment. Policymakers would be reassured by signs in the PMI report that manufacturers\u2019 cost pressures eased in July, said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to forecasting body, the EY ITEM Club. Input prices rose at the slowest pace in more than a year, according to the survey. \u201cThe survey pointed to a further marked easing of price pressures in the manufacturing sector in July, which fuels hope that UK inflation is close to peaking and will go down well at the Bank of England,\u201d said Archer.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British Gas has raised electricity prices by 12.5% in a move consumer experts warned could kick off a new round of price rises from rival suppliers this winter. The company, owned by Centrica, left its gas prices unchanged, which means the average annual dual fuel bill will rise by 7.3%, or \u00a376, to \u00a31,120. The increase, which takes effect on 15 September, will affect 3.1 million customers. The company said it would give a \u00a376 credit to more than 200,000 vulnerable customers to protect them from the increase. Ministers expressed concern about the rise, which they said should not be blamed on government policy, and said they were not ruling out future steps to \u201cincrease fairness for customers\u201d. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: \u201cEnergy firms should treat all their customers fairly and we\u2019re concerned this price rise will hit many people already on poor-value tariffs. \u201cWe are not ruling anything out \u2013 whether it is action by the regulator or legislation \u2013 to increase fairness for customers.\u201d Shadow energy minister Alan Whitehead called it a \u201cwhopping rise\u201d and said the government should take further action. \u201cThere was an agreement coming into the election that there should be a price cap operating across the market and action should be taken on the standard variable tariffs that so many customers are on. Unfortunately the government has changed their minds about that now and we want to press them to change their minds,\u201d the Labour MP told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday. The chief executive of Citizens Advice, Gillian Guy, said: \u201cBritish Gas has in recent years been offering one of the less expensive standard variable tariffs from a larger firm, but today\u2019s price rise will close this gap and hit longstanding customers hardest. This price rise has been issued despite costs for energy firms dropping in recent months.\u201d Iain Conn, Centrica\u2019s chief executive, defended the move, saying the electricity price rise was the first since November 2013 and reflected a 16% rise in the cost of energy and delivery to customers\u2019 homes since 2014. \u201cWe haven\u2019t taken the decision lightly,\u201d he said on Sky News. \u201cWe realise that 3.1 miilon people are affected. I should stress that just over 5 million customers are unaffected by today\u2019s news. In the end we\u2019ve had to respond, like many of our competitors, to the underlying increases we\u2019ve seen in electricity.\u201d Martin Lewis, the founder of the MoneySavingExpert website, said the move was a catch-up price rise from British Gas and might prompt another batch of rises this winter. Previous price freezes by British Gas had lulled customers into a \u201cfalse sense of security that it wouldn\u2019t move prices\u201d, Lewis said, which meant consumers did nothing, \u201cwhen they could have cut their rate and locked that in for longer by actively picking a far cheaper one-year fixed energy tariff.\u201d He added that the cheapest tariffs on the market cost \u00a3844. News of the price rise came as Centrica reported an adjusted profit before tax of \u00a3639m for the six months to June, down from \u00a3688m a year earlier. Conn, who was handed a pay rise of nearly 40% last year, taking his remuneration package to \u00a34.15m, said: \u201cCentrica delivered a solid first-half financial performance despite reduced energy demand due to warm weather and strong competitive pressures, and we remain on track to achieve the 2017 targets we set out in February.\u201d Households are missing out on the cheapest tariffs by not switching suppliers. Although the number of people switching rose by 30% last year, around two-thirds of bill payers are still on the worst-value standard tariffs. Trials are under way on how to encourage people to switch. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, said: \u201cI\u2019m worried the Conservatives\u2019 promise to \u2018end unfair practices in the energy market\u2019 will make people think they don\u2019t need to switch. They do. There is no guarantee when and if anything will be done, so it\u2019s not worth wasting money while you wait. \u201cSwitching energy deals could help you to save now and protect you against hikes in the near future. There\u2019s no point sticking with the same supplier when you could pay hundreds less for exactly the same service elsewhere.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Allegations that British American Tobacco was involved in bribery and corruption in Africa are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office, despite the cigarette company\u2019s attempts to downplay the significance of a whistleblower who handed over a dossier of evidence. BAT, now the largest tobacco company in the world after the recent merger with Reynolds, has consistently denied the allegations of Paul Hopkins, whom it employed in Africa for 13 years. When Hopkins handed over a large number of documents to the SFO in December 2015, BAT dismissed him as \u201ca rogue former employee\u201d. The company later toned down its criticism, stating that it had appointed a team of external legal advisers to investigate the charges. The SFO\u2019s inquiries have now become a formal investigation. In a statement it said it was \u201cinvestigating suspicions of corruption in the conduct of business by BAT, its subsidiaries and associated persons\u201d. It invited members of the public to come forward with any evidence they might have. The news follows a major Guardian investigation revealing that BAT and other multinationals have used threats against at least eight African nations, demanding they axe or dilute the kind of tobacco control measures that have saved millions of lives in the west. BAT said it continued to conduct its own inquiries into Hopkins\u2019 charges. \u201cWe have been cooperating with the Serious Fraud Office and British American Tobacco has been informed that the SFO has now opened a formal investigation. BAT intends to cooperate with that investigation,\u201d it said. The company would not confirm whether the investigation concerned the allegations made by Hopkins. He has claimed he paid bribes on the company\u2019s behalf to the Kenya Revenue Authority for access to information that BAT could use against its Kenyan competitor Mastermind. Hopkins also claimed that BAT Kenya had paid bribes to government officials in Burundi, Rwanda and Comoros to undermine tobacco control regulations. BAT hired the law firm Linklaters in February 2016 to conduct a \u201cfull investigation\u201d into the claims made by Hopkins. BAT later dropped Linklaters and appointed Slaughter and May as sole adviser on the case. Louis Charalambous, Hopkins\u2019 solicitor, said BAT had changed its tone. \u201cWe note, with interest, that BAT have abandoned their earlier PR strategy of trying to shoot the messenger,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cPaul Hopkins blew the whistle during his time at BAT and their internal team ignored him. Previously BAT tried to wriggle out by saying that Mr Hopkins had left their employ in acrimonious circumstances when, in fact, that was untrue. They also wrongly suggested that he had acted on his own, and portrayed themselves as the victims. \u201cNow their new external law firm and revised PR strategy are silent about Mr Hopkins. They need to go further and set the record straight. The company cannot rewrite this history, and we look forward to seeing them answer these allegations in due course.\u201d Hopkins said he had turned whistleblower at a cost to himself. \u201cI rejected an enhanced redundancy package designed to force me to sign a global confidentially agreement and just took statutory redundancy instead,\u201d he said. Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of the campaigning charity Ash, said: \u201cAt the time the allegations of fraud in Africa were first made against BAT the company accused the whistle blower of having a vendetta against the company and peddling falsehoods. \u201cEighteen months later and BAT is having to admit it\u2019s under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. The SFO must leave no stone unturned.\u201d Matthew Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called on the US government to also investigate BAT. \u201cThe allegations against British American Tobacco are serious and should be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d he said. \u201cAs British American Tobacco now operates the largest publicly traded tobacco company within the United States, we urge the US Department of Justice to also investigate the company\u2019s alleged misconduct.\u201d The BAT chief executive, Nicandro Durante, told the Financial Times in March that the firm would \u201cact in a very strong way\u201d if wrongdoing was found to have taken place. He said: \u201cWe are in 200 countries, so I cannot give a 100% guarantee that everything\u2019s going to go by the book.\u201d The SFO investigation is another blow to the company, after the US health watchdog, the Food and Drug Administration, announced tighter regulations on the tobacco industry, which hit shares in tobacco firms.",
