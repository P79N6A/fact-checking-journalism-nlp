      "bodyText": "And finally, Reuters sums it up: French jobless total posts rare fall in August The French jobless total eased back in August from a record high reached in July, breaking a nine month streak of increases and offering President Francois Hollande a rare glimmer of hope on the unemployment front. The Labour Ministry said the jobless total in mainland France fell by 11,100 to 3,413,300, down 0.3 percent over one month, but up 5.1 percent over one year. The fall was the first decrease in since October 2013. Hollande has seen his popularity fall to record lows for a modern French leader as he failed to live up to promises to get unemployment falling. See earlier post for more details and reaction. Bonne nuit, et que vous voyez dans la matin\u00e9e. GW France24 reminds us what French ministers plans to do to bring growth and jobs to its stubbornly stagnant economy: The government\u2019s plan to cure the patient is the much-vaunted but controversial \u201cResponsibility Pact\u201d, which will cut social charges for businesses by 40 billion euros ($52 billion) in exchange for them creating 500,000 jobs by 2017. But the public spending reductions planned to pay for these tax cuts are very unpopular with some on the left. France\u2019s labour minister, Francois Rebsamen, also said tonight that Paris will push ahead with its pro-business reform programme of tax and spending cuts; designed to create growth which is \u201crich in employment\u201d In other labour market news: Writing in the FT, Hugh Carnegy says tonight\u2019s jobless figures are the first good news about the French economy since a hoped-for return to growth this year failed to materialise. The plunge in Mr Hollande\u2019s approval ratings to as low as 13 per cent, according to recent polls, was partly prompted by his unfulfilled promise to reverse by the end of last year the upward trend in unemployment, which stands above 10 per cent of the workforce. Instead, it kept on rising throughout the first half of this year and is up by 500,000 since he took office in mid-2012. Some late news from France -- the jobless total has, at long last, dropped. Official statistics from the Labour Ministry showed there are were 3.41 million people claiming jobless benefits in France in August. That\u2019s a drop of 0.3%, or 11,100, compared with July; the first month-on-month drop since October 2013. A rare piece of encouraging economic news for the French government, after yesterday\u2019s PMI surveys showed its private sector contracting again. In a statement, labour minister Fran\u00e7ois Rebsamen was cautious: \u201cI take note of this drop, but I consider, as I have said several times, that monthly figures should only be interpreted over the long term.\u201d And as fastFT flags up, economists say France isn\u2019t out of the woods. Dominique Barbet of BNP Paribas said \u201cwe take this good news with a pinch of salt\u201d. He reckons unemployment fell because more people are being employed to look after French school children in the afternoon after a timetabling change. Barbet explains: The reorganisation of the working time in French primary schools has required the hiring of many people to look after the kids in the later part of the afternoon. And the jobless total is still much higher than a year ago: The news comes as France\u2019s main business group urged the government to scrap the 35-hour work week, raise the legal retirement age and cut the minimum wage. Medef said the move would help tackle France\u2019s high unemployment and stimulate growth. More details here. Soothing words from ECB president Mario Draghi about the central bank keeping monetary policy loose for an extended period, as well as better than expected US new home sales, have pushed markets into positive territory after recent declines, writes Nick Fletcher. There are of course still many concerns, not least worries about the outlook for the eurozone and Chinese economies, as well as the repercussions of US air strikes on Isis in Syria. But for now the mood was a little more positive, and the closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 30.19 points or 0.45% higher at 6706.27 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.7% to 9661.97 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.25% at4413.72 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.67% to 20,691.04 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.51% to 10,856.9 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 81 points or 0.48% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Here\u2019s more detail from Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s on Tesco: We are placing our \u2018BBB/A-2\u2019 long- and short-term corporate credit ratings on Tesco PLC on CreditWatch with negative implications. We plan to resolve our CreditWatch placement when the findings of the independent investigation are available and the implications for Tesco\u2019s management, governance, profitability, and financials are clearer. Our assessment of Tesco\u2019s financial risk profile as \u201csignificant\u201d takes into account Tesco\u2019s sizable debt on a lease- and pension-adjusted basis. Despite capital expenditure (capex) and dividend savings, we forecast the decline in profits will significantly weaken credit metrics...Management\u2019s commitment to maintain investment-grade credit ratings--demonstrated by its recent financial policy decisions about capex and, more importantly, shareholder remuneration\u2014provides us some support in our assessment of the financial risk profile. However, continued weakening of credit protection metrics could cause us to lower the financial risk profile to \u201caggressive\u201d. More bad news for Tesco as Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s became the latest agency to put the supermarket\u2019s credit rating on negative watch. S&amp;P revised down its management and governance assessment for Tesco from satisfactory to fair, and said it expected the supermarket\u2019s profitability would continue to weaken as market competition in the UK remained high. US new home sales have hit a six year high, according to the Commerce department. Sales of new single family homes jumped 18% in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 504,000. This is the second straight month of gains, with July\u2019s data revised upwards to show a 1.9% gain compared to the previously reported 2.4% drop. The August number is much better than analysts\u2019 expectations of an increase to 430,00.0. Helped by the housing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged up by around 9 points, although investors are still cautious given various concerns about the global economy, and the US airstrikes against Isis in Syria. Recap time. Concern is growing over the state of Germany\u2019s economy after confidence among business leaders fell to its lowest in over a year. Geopolitical tensions, and the weakness of the wider European economy, are hitting its firms. IFO, the Munich thinktank, warned that exports looking more disappointing, adding: \u201cThe German economy is no longer running smoothly.\u201d Full details start here ING reckons the deteriorating confidence means the Bundesbank will stop opposing the European Central Bank\u2019s efforts to stimulate the euro area. Saxo Bank warned that Germany\u2019s growth is moderating. IHS Global Insight says the conflicts in Eastern Ukraine and the Middle East are having a more serious impact on German firms than expected. And Berenberg fears that the drop in confidence will mean firms rein in their investments: The financial markets, though, are taking the news well; reassured by a pledge from ECB chief Mario Draghi to do everything possible to fight deflation. Here\u2019s the transcript The Moscow market is up, on hopes that the tensions over Ukraine could ease. A profit warning from TNT Express, blamed on the weak European economy, is weighing on investors. The company\u2019s shares are down over 10% this afternoon. In other news: Sir Philip Hampton is expected to be named as GSK\u2019s chairman soon. Dublin house prices are up almost 25% in the last year Britain\u2019s accountancy watchdog has suggested that Tesco could be forced to restate historic financial results, after it overstated profits by \u00a3250m. It has also emerged that Tesco director Mark Armour, who also serves on the FRC, is being kept away from the scrutiny. Just to clarify, Richard Branson\u2019s \u201ctake all the holiday you want\u2019 offer applies to his own personal staff, not the entire Virgin Empire. They have to keep clocking in, alas. The US dollar is rallying in the foreign exchange markets - hitting its highest level against a basket of currencies since 2010. This has pushed the euro down below the $1.28 mark. Heads-up: Sky News sleuth Mark Kleinman reckons that pharmaceuticals firm GlaxoSmithKline will name Sir Philip Hampton, currently the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, as its next chairman before the weekend. That would end the uncertainty over GSK\u2019s leadership once Sir Chris Gent steps down, and open a new debate over who will be chosen to fill the chairman\u2019s seat at RBS after Hampton..... Back in the markets....Wall Street has opened calmly after three days of falls. The Dow Jones industrial average is up a teensy 10 points, or 0.08%, at 17067, and the S&amp;P and Nasdaq also show small gains. Joao Monteiro, analyst at Valutrades, says the US markets are taking their lead from Asia, where markets finished broadly higher after an early dip. Arguably if prospects in Asia are looking a little more upbeat then the positive sentiment can be justified. Now here\u2019s a thing...Sir Richard Branson has abolished the holiday allowance, declaring that staff at his private wealth management firm  can take \u2018as much holiday as they like\u2019, as long as work doesn\u2019t suffer... More here: Staff can take as much holiday as they like, says Richard Branson See you all in 2015.... Here\u2019s something for the parents among you to ponder. Mohamed El-Erian, who sensationally quit bond-trading giant Pimco in January last year , has now revealed the reasons behind his exit. And he says the trigger came from his daughter, aged 10, who handed him a list of more than 20 important events in her life which he had missed, while chasing profits at Pimco instead. He made the admission in an interview with Reuters: His reason for leaving is a cliche of departing executives: the wish to spend more time with family. El-Erian said that he decided it was more important to be a good dad than a good investor. He realized he needed a change in May 2013, after his then-10-year-old daughter wrote him a list of 22 milestone events in her life he had missed.... Allianz also reported that the record low interest rates in force across the eurozone has hurt German savers. Its Wealth Report states: Global gross financial assets rise to new record high of \u20ac118trn in 2013 Western Europe falling behind Low interest rates have cost German savers almost \u20ac23bn. Germany comes in 16th in the global ranking of net per capita financial assets The bright and (somewhat) dark side to global wealth distribution: 65 million \u201closers\u201d but almost half a billion \u201cwinners\u201d Chief economist Michael Heise says: \u201cWealth development in Germany is truly mediocre in the truest sense of the word\u201d. \u201cAt the same time, the Germans are above-average savers. But it is also the case that almost nobody invests quite as much money with banks as the Germans do, even though bank interest rates are far lower than in the rest of Europe. German savers would appear to be stuck in crisis mode and shying away from making investment decisions.\u201d The number of people across the globe who can be categorised as \u201cmiddle class\u201d has swelled to almost one billion. That\u2019s one finding from the latest Allianz Global Wealth Report, which our data blog editor, Alberto Nardelli, has been analysing. He writes: One of the most interesting sections in the report is on the growth of a global middle class - which is now nearing the one billion mark. Allianz defines this \u201cwealth middle class\u201d by taking the average global net per capita financial assets (\u20ac17,700 in 2013), as a basis, and then encompasses all individuals with assets corresponding to somewhere between 30% and 180% of this figure..... The share of the population that falls into the wealth middle class in global terms has doubled in Latin America, has almost trebled in eastern Europe and has increased seven-fold in Asia. But 3.5 billion people don\u2019t own enough wealth to qualify: Here\u2019s the full piece: Global middle class nears one billion mark Houses in Dublin are now almost 25% more than a year ago as the Republic\u2019s property market continues to recover. Henry McDonald writes: Ireland\u2019s Central Statistic Office has revealed that house prices in the capital are 23.1 per cent higher than 2013. The CSO also report on Wednesday that apartment price are also on the rise with the cost a flat now more than 26 per cent compared to this time last year. Overall property prices are 2.3 per cent higher across the Republic than they were last year reflecting the strength of the Dublin property market compared to areas beyond the capital. But the CSO latest report also puts these latest rises in some proper context. It notes that house prices in Dublin are still nearly 40 per cent lower than their 2007 peak when the Celtic Tiger was still roaring. Apartments in the capital are still around 46 per cent lower than in the boom times. Nationally the CSO said residential properties in all other parts of Ireland are 45 per cent lower than in 2007. Those with long memories, though, may worry, Henry concludes: It was the nation\u2019s obsession with rising property prices that fuelled an overheated market, prompting speculators and builders to borrow billions from Irish banks that in large part helped bust the Irish economy. Germany is suffering more than expected from the crisis in the Middle East, and events in Eastern Ukraine, says Timo Klein, senior German economist at IHS Global Insight. The winding back of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s stimulus package is also hitting German firms, Klein reckons: German business confidence is being hurt by ongoing geopolitical concerns, especially about Ukraine/Russia and the IS threat in Iraq and Syria, and by problems that some emerging economies have with the US Fed\u2019s shift towards less expansionary monetary policy. Klein fears that today\u2019s drop in the IFO index is part of an ongoing trend: In September, the headline Ifo business climate index declined for the fifth consecutive month, thus reaching its lowest level since April 2013. The index fell from 106.3 to 104.7. This compares to the joint February and April interim high of 111.2 (last exceeded in mid-2011) and the starting level of the latest upward trend at 100.3 in October 2012. Unlike the two previous setbacks during this upward trend, namely in March/April 2013 (following Italian elections and Cypriot debt stand-off) and in October 2013 (concerns raised by the U.S. government shutdown and debt ceiling conflict), the current downward correction appears to be sustained. Mads Koefoed, head of macro strategy at Saxo Bank, says the drop in German business confidence shows that its growth is \u201cmoderating\u201d. He predicts modest growth this year, and in 2015: We expect the German economy to bounce back in Q3, led by investment, which was particularly weak in Q2 as much of the demand had been carried forward into Q1 due to unseasonably good weather (the opposite of the US). In spite of the expected bounce-back this quarter we do not expect the German economy to grow at anything more than a moderate rate in the coming quarters \u2013 as also suggested by IFO. We look for GDP growth of 1.4% this year and around 1.5% next year (below the current consensus expectation of 1.8%). That growth doesn\u2019t feel like enough to haul the eurozone into a brighter future..... And here\u2019s a handy chart from Saxo, showing the IFO index over the last decade: TNT\u2019s profit warning, and German business leaders\u2019 increasing jitteriness hasn\u2019t helped the mood in Europe\u2019s stock markets. The main indices are mixed, with the FTSE 100 falling for the third day running: Chris Beauchamp, IG market analyst, says: Indices are still broadly lower as investors continue to fret about possible geopolitical flashpoints, while yet more poor German data confirmed the bleak outlook in Europe.... German IFO data was weaker once again, and while some of this is down to the Ukraine situation, the ongoing leaking of the periphery\u2019s problems into the eurozone\u2019s core nations is not going to help matters. Beauchamp adds that Mario Draghi\u2019s declaration this morning that policy will remain loose has done little to reassure investors as: markets would much prefer action over fine words Shares in TNT Express are now down 11.3% as its profits warning continues to reverberate around the Amsterdam stock market. Here\u2019s our news story: TNT blames deepening eurozone woes for profit warning Back to the latest drop in German business confidence. IFO, which reported that firms are gloomier about current conditions and future prospects, warned that: \u201cThe German economy is no longer running smoothly.\u201d IFO also reckons that German\u2019s traditional strength, exports, is suffering. President Hans-Werner Sinn Sinn warns: \u201chardly any stimulus is expected from export business.\u201d If he\u2019s right, that\u2019s a good reason for Germany to do everything in its power to help the rest of the eurozone return to growth. ECB chied Mario Draghi touched on this issue in his interview with Europe1 this morning: Are there three or four words that symbolize your ambition for Europe? Draghi: First is investment. Private investment, but also public investment. Did you say it to Ms Merkel? Draghi: I did say so in Jackson Hole. Not to her, but to every country that has fiscal space. But the other thing that we have to remember is -- and I did say this before -- we have to restore confidence. Investors, entrepreneurs have to go back being confident in the future and in the resilience and robustness of Europe. Reading between the lines of the FRC\u2019s statement on Tesco, it may be hinting that the supermarket will be forced to take the humiliating step of restating historic statements. It will all depend how far back the accounting problems go. The \u00a3250m profit misreporting occurred in an unscheduled profit warning in late August, not a full-blown financial result statement. Over in the Telegraph, Graham Ruddick writes (\u00a3) that some analysts suspect the issue runs deeper.... Bruno Monteyne, analyst at Bernstein, warned that the practices that led to the accounting issue may have been going on for three years. He said: \u201cThese are not normal times for Tesco and as profits have declined over several years, Tesco has been pulling in all the favours it can get, without delivering yet the benefits. Back in the UK, the Financial Reporting Council, the accountancy watchdog, has confirmed that it is monitoring Tesco \u201cclosely\u201d following Monday\u2019s shock news that it overstated its profits by \u00a3250m. The FRC says: \u201cThe FRC has disciplinary powers in relation to misconduct by accountants and, through the Financial Reporting Review Panel, can also require a company to restate its financial statements. The FRC does not have powers to monitor or require restatement of unaudited trading statements. It will consider the outcome of the investigation announced by the company and determine whether it should take regulatory action.\u201d We flagged up the FRC\u2019s involvement last night. The Times\u2019s Alistair Osborne isn\u2019t impressed: Tesco shares are down another 0.5% today at 193.1p, levels not seen since 2003. Here\u2019s a worrying chart, from Berenberg bank. It shows the correlation between the IFO expectations measure and how much German firms actually spend on new machinery: So today\u2019s drop in the German business expectations measure to 99.3, from 101.7, suggests firms may cut back on investment too.... Newsnight\u2019s Duncan Weldon suggests German firms are too willing to blame the Russia-Ukraine crisis for their woes: As flagged earlier, IFO\u2019s Klaus Wohlrabe predicts a weak GDP reading for the third quarter of this year: And Associated Press agrees that \u201cthe persistent turmoil in Ukraine and sluggish European growth\u201d has been driving German business confidence down for months. Steve Collins, global head of dealing at London &amp; Capital Asset Management, points out that today\u2019s IFO\u2019s report is the latest in a stream of bad economic news from Europe recently: ING economist Carsten Brzeski reckons this latest fall in German business confidence should prevent the Bundesbank speaking out against the ECB\u2019s plans to stimulate the eurozone. German business confidence has fallen again this month, in another signal that Europe\u2019s largest economy is struggling. The IFO business climate index has dropped to 104.7 this month, down from 106.3 in August, and much weaker than the 108 recorded in September 2013. German firms reported that they are gloomier about current conditions, and also less upbeat about the future. The business conditions index dropped to 110.5, from 111.1. And the business expectations measure fell to 99.3, from 101.7 in August. It suggests that the German economy may not have rallied sharply in recent months, after contracting by 0.2% in the second quarter of this year. IFO economist Dr Klaus Wohlrabe says that reduced export expectations are hitting business confidence. He fears that growth in the third quarter could be weak. Alexander Koch, an economist at Raiffeisen Schweiz in Zurich, told Bloomberg this morning that geopolitical tensions and the weak European economy has been pushing the IFO index down \u201csubstantially\u201d since spring. \u201cDrivers of the moderation are the Ukraine conflict and lower growth momentum in the neighboring euro-area countries. Dynamics should stabilize in autumn and provide the way for somewhat better growth prospects again at the end of the year.\u201d I\u2019ll pull some reaction together now.... Hat-tip to the ECB, who have uploaded a full transcript of Mario Draghi\u2019s interview on Europe 1 this morning Here\u2019s one question I missed earlier: Otherwise you see anti-Europe political parties rise:, in Germany, in Greece and even in France with Marine Le Pen that argues for the return to national currency. It seems that you are worried, what is the best answer to this? The best answer to this, but also to the sense of lack of hope that the millions of unemployed people have in the euro area -- the best answer is to do the reforms, implement the appropriate policies and monetary policy will do its task. Just in: Trinity Mirror, the UK newspaper and publishing group, has issued a statement to the City on \u201chistoric legal issues\u201d. It says that its subsidiary MGN Ltd has \u201cadmitted liability to four individuals who had sued MGN for alleged interception of their voicemails many years ago\u201d. It has apologised, and agreed to pay compensation. It also added that \u201csix other voicemail interception claims have already been settled for agreed sums\u201d. My colleagues will have more details on this shortly. In the City, shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have dipped after it was forced to cut the price for the flotation of its Citizens business. Investors demanded, and got, a lower price from RBS after expressing doubts about the US bank\u2019s prospects for profitability. So instead of selling Citizens for between $23 (\u00a314) and $25 a share, the initial public offering (IPO) was priced at $21.50 a share in New York. That means Citizens is worth about $12bn, not the $14bn pricetag RBS was aiming for. RBS shares have responded accordingly, down 1.5% at 352.7. Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, has taken to the airwaves this morning, in an attempt to calm fears over the eurozone economy. Draghi told France\u2019s Europe 1 radio station that the ECB will keep its monetary policy \u201caccommodative\u201d for as long as needed, and do everything in its power to avoid the eurozone slumping into deflation. He said: \u201cMonetary policy will remain accommodating for a long time and I can tell you that the Governing Council is unanimous in committing itself to using the tools at its disposal to bring inflation back to just under 2%.\u201d Interest rates will remain low because they can\u2019t get much lower,\u201d Earlier this month the ECB cut the headline eurozone interest rate to just 0.05%, which really is the lowest point they can reach. The ECB chief also warned that monetary policy alone cannot bring Europe back to growth. He insisted that he doesn\u2019t see a risk of deflation, and cited unemployment as the biggest threat to the European economy. Here\u2019s a few more snaps off the wires: DRAGHI SAYS EU BUDGET RULES ARE THERE TO BE RESPECTED DRAGHI SAYS EURO IS IRREVERSIBLE AND WE WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES IN OUR MANDATE TO WATCH OVER IT DRAGHI ON STRUCTURAL REFORMS IN EUROPE SAYS RISK OF DOING TOO LITTLE IS GREATER THAN DOING TOO MUCH And although there\u2019s nothing jaw-dropping here, Draghi\u2019s words do seem to be calming the European markets, which are broadly flat in early trading. Shares in TNT Express are sliding in early trading, down almost 10% as traders in Amsterdam punish the company for its profits warning. They are currently down \u20ac0.55 at \u20ac5.060. TNT\u2019s chief executive Tex Gunning has said today\u2019s profit warning was \u201cdisappointing\u201d, but insisted the company remained on the right track. Gunning also warned that it could take until 2019 to fix TNT\u2019s fortunes, Reuters reports: \u201cThe company\u2019s turnaround programme was \u201csolid\u201d, he said, but would \u201crealistically take three to five years for the full benefits to come through.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. Some disappointing news to start the day - Dutch parcel firm TNT Express has issued a profit warning after realising that Europe\u2019s economy is weaker than it had hoped. TNT dropped an unwelcome surprise on shareholders this morning, warning that: \u201cSince the interim results of July 28, 2014, overall trading conditions in Europe have deteriorated further and competitive pressures have increased.\u201d It has now slashed its 2015 profit forecast, which was based on an economic growth rate in Europe of between 2 and 3%. That now looks ambitious, given the IMF expects growth of just 1.1%. It\u2019s another sign that Europe\u2019s economy not in great shape; six months ago, TNT\u2019s CEO was declaring that he hoped \u201cthe worst is behind us in terms of the economic recession\u201d. It\u2019s a double-whammy for TNT investors; the company is also setting aside \u20ac50m to settle a French competition case, Shares in the company are expected to be hit hard. There\u2019s an edgy feel in the European markets today, after two days of heavy falls which saw Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 suffer its biggest drop since March yesterday. A mixed session in Asia overnight saw the MSCI index of leading shares hit a four-month low, before recovering a little. Traders remain worried about geopolitical tensions -- with fresh air strikes on ISIS positions in Syria this morning. Stan Shamu of IG Index says: Ahead of the European open, we\u2019re calling the major bourses weaker, with investors still concerned about growth and the effectiveness of policy measures. On the calendar we have the German Ifo business climate reading and Italy\u2019s consumer confidence data. The Ifo index measures business confidence in the Eurozone\u2019s largest economy, so it should show how much German companies have been hit by the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. Some economists reckon we shouldn\u2019t give it too much attention, though: I\u2019ll be covering the main events through the day...",

      "bodyText": "Tesco chairman Sir Richard Broadbent is under mounting pressure to pay for the crisis now engulfing the UK\u2019s biggest retailer with his job. Little wonder \u2013 the grocery chain is worth half what it was a year ago and the problems are only mounting. Is there a case for the defence? For a start, he wasn\u2019t responsible for appointing Philip Clarke, now universally deemed to have been the wrong person to have succeeded Sir Terry Leahy. It was former chairman David Reid, a 25-year veteran on Tesco\u2019s board, who chose Clarke from the crew of competing executives. Broadbent became chairman in November 2011, almost 18 months later. Second, when Clarke resigned this July, the act was viewed as a decisive piece of chairmanship; the City had assumed Broadbent would give him one more Christmas. Third, plucking Dave Lewis out of Unilever looks a smart piece of recruitment. Fourth, Tesco is not alone in being short on frontline retailing experience among its non-executives. Next is the most admired retailer in the FTSE 100 index but its non-executives comprise an investment banker, an accountant, a property developer and a lawyer. As for the lack of executives on Tesco\u2019s board, who are they supposed to be? Leahy\u2019s senior wingmen \u2013 Andrew Higginson, Tim Mason, Richard Brasher and David Potts \u2013 quit, retired or were culled under Clarke. The new generation has yet to earn its stripes. Convinced? You shouldn\u2019t be. The above, at best, amounts to a case for mitigation. The bottom line is that Tesco\u2019s estimated profits for the half-year were overstated by \u00a3250m on Broadbent\u2019s watch at a time of huge management upheaval. The investigation now underway will have to establish whether a scandal or a shambles has occurred. It has to be one or the other \u2013 and both reflect badly on Broadbent and his boardroom colleagues. On 29 August, when the fateful announcement was made that first-half trading profits would be \u00a31.1bn, Tesco\u2019s board comprised nine non-executives and just one executive director, namely Clarke, who was awaiting Lewis\u2019s arrival. Laurie McIlwee, the finance director, had resigned in April and, while his services were still available to Tesco, he had not be seen at the Cheshunt head office. Indeed, he had evidently been told, in a letter penned by Clarke, to stay away. In May, Mike Iddon, the finance director of the UK business, also departed. There was a management vacuum in the finance department \u2013 an astonishing position for the world\u2019s third largest retailer to find itself in. Back in 2011, the main board boasted seven executives. From seven retailing executives to one in the space of three years represents a transformation \u2013 and a huge business risk if, as at Tesco, none of the non-executives are retailers. Entrepreneur Luke Johnson, in a furious piece in the FT, is surely right on two counts: Tesco\u2019s troubles run deeper than the profits mis-statement; and a board loaded with non-retailing non-executives at a company of Tesco\u2019s complexity will struggle to challenge what it is being told. For example, the fiasco in the US, where Fresh &amp; Easy clocked up loss after loss, was allowed to drift until the end of 2012, at least two years after the outside world had spotted that it was not going to work. The profits overstatement itself was not uncovered by a cavalry charge from the audit committee, chaired by former Cadbury finance director Ken Hanna. Instead, it was an internal whistleblower in the finance department, apparently frustrated by being ignored, who prevented Tesco\u2019s actual half-year results in October, as opposed to August\u2019s trading update, from being full of holes. There seems to be little point in removing Broadbent in the midst of the current turmoil. His integrity is not in question and a former Whitehall big-hitter, it might be argued, it\u2019s just the chap to get to the bottom of an accounting debacle. Once the dust settles, though, Broadbent\u2019s lack of retailing experience is too glaring to ignore. Lewis, after a 28-year career at Unilever, is learning about retailing on the job. It would seem impossible, after this week\u2019s events, that the chairman could also be a retailing amateur. Who could fill the role? There is an obvious candidate and, happily, he may soon be looking for a job \u2013 Sir Ian Cheshire. Kingfisher\u2019s chief executive is leaving in January after seven successful years and ticks most of the boxes. The strategic headache Cheshire inherited at B&amp;Q has a parallel at Tesco \u2013 the DIY chain had discovered that merely opening more stores doesn\u2019t get you anywhere in a competitive and saturated market. A Cheshire tactic was to impose rigorous controls from the centre on a previously disjointed group \u2013 that could be useful. Cheshire would bring international experience from Kingfisher, which is big in France with Castorama; and, like Tesco, he\u2019s been toiling with a nightmare in China. A lack of experience in food would be a disadvantage but, let\u2019s face facts, former Sainsbury\u2019s boss Justin King, the other big retailing beast on the market, will not be joining Tesco. Nor has Cheshire ever chaired a big plc \u2013 but, if hard UK retailing experience is what Tesco needs, he definitely offers that. It is, of course, impossible to know whether Cheshire would actually want to chair Tesco, or even be a regular non-executive. But he\u2019s only 55 and doesn\u2019t seem the type to drift into a quiet early retirement. Somebody at Tesco should put in a call.",

A Cheshire tactic was to impose rigorous controls from the centre on a previously disjointed group \u2013 that could be useful.</p> <p>Cheshire would bring international experience from Kingfisher, which is big in France with Castorama; and, like Tesco, he\u2019s been toiling with a nightmare in China. A lack of experience in food would be a disadvantage but, let\u2019s face facts, former Sainsbury\u2019s boss Justin King, the other big retailing beast on the market, will not be joining Tesco. Nor has Cheshire ever chaired a big plc \u2013 but, if hard UK retailing experience is what Tesco needs, he definitely offers that.</p> <p>It is, of course, impossible to know whether Cheshire would actually want to chair Tesco, or even be a regular non-executive. But he\u2019s only 55 and doesn\u2019t seem the type to drift into a quiet early retirement. Somebody at Tesco should put in a call.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco\u2019s second biggest shareholder has sold part of its stake in the troubled supermarket chain, it was announced last night, as repercussions mounted from the retailer\u2019s \u00a3250m accounting scandal. The US investor BlackRock now controls less than 5% of the retailer\u2019s stock, according to a statement issued to the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday which showed that the sell-off had taken place the day after news emerged that the mishandling of supplier payments meant Tesco\u2019s profits would be much lower than predicted. BlackRock\u2019s stake had edged through 5% in August, but it is not clear how far it has fallen back. Tesco shares stabilised after falling 11.5% on Monday and 4% the following day, when new market data revealed a further dive in the supermarket\u2019s sales. The shares have halved in the last 12 months and closed last night at 194.9p. Tesco\u2019s admission of potential accounting problems prompted ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s to put its creditworthiness under review yesterday pending the outcome of the retailer\u2019s internal investigation into the affair. Pressure on Tesco\u2019s board, and particularly chairman Sir Richard Broadbent, increased as the ratings agency said it had lowered its assessment of management and governance at the group to \u201cfair\u201d from \u201csatisfactory\u201d. More than one shareholder is understood to be planning to discuss Broadbent\u2019s position. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: \u201cBroadbent has said shareholders will decide if he is part of the problem or part of the solution. To my mind part of the problem is that Tesco needs to have an effective chairman.\u201d Tesco confirmed it had not had a finance director for five months until Tuesday, when Alan Stewart was released from Marks &amp; Spencer two months early to help oversee investigators from Deloitte and Freshfields appointed over the weekend to review the accounts. The finances had been in the charge of a group of senior finance personnel reporting directly to the then chief executive, Philip Clarke. As well as the internal investigation, the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Serious Fraud Office and the accounting watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council, are all monitoring the situation. On Wednesday the FRC said that a non-executive director of the troubled supermarket business who also sits on the FRC board \u2013 Mark Armour \u2013 would be frozen out of any discussions relating to the accounting issues. The FRC, which can force companies to restate their accounts and take action against auditors, said it would decide whether to take regulatory action once Tesco had completed its investigation. Tesco\u2019s revelations have sent shockwaves through the retail sector and rivals Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s moved to reassure shareholders that they had examined their own reporting standards on supplier incentives, payments and discounts. It is standard practice for suppliers to pay supermarkets for product placement, sales targets and promotions. One accountant said that six of the top 10 UK supermarkets had run an internal audit in the last six years of how they recorded the cash they get from suppliers. \u201cMorrisons is satisfied that supplier income is calculated correctly and recognised in the appropriate period. In their report, KPMG described the work they did in their audit on supplier income and overall gave a clean opinion on the Morrisons accounts,\u201d the Bradford-based chain said in a statement. Sainsbury\u2019s declined to reveal whether it was checking its systems, but said: \u201cOur accounting principles dictate that we recognise income and costs at the appropriate time and we abide by those principles.\u201d Sainsbury is due to update the City on its second-quarter trading next week. Black said: \u201cIt is inevitable the subject is going to be raised. Supplier payments are a feature of the retail industry in general, not just the grocery industry, and a lot of company boards will be making sure their policies on revenue recognition are robust.\u201d Tesco\u2019s board: what retail experience do they have? Sir Richard Broadbent Chairman Began his career at HM Treasury before moving into investment banking and then back to Whitehall. He has also been deputy chairman of Barclays. Broadbent has been Tesco chairman since 2011. Dave Lewis Chief executive Rushed into his new job as Philip Clarke\u2019s replacement in early September.

On Wednesday the FRC said that a non-executive director of the troubled supermarket business who also sits on the FRC board \u2013 Mark Armour \u2013 would be frozen out of any discussions <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/22/tesco-loses-2bn-value-250m-profit-overstatement-investigation\" title=\"\">relating to the accounting issues</a>.</p> <p>The FRC, which can force companies to restate their accounts and take action against auditors, said it would decide whether to take regulatory action once Tesco had completed its investigation. Tesco\u2019s revelations have sent shockwaves through the retail sector and rivals Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s moved to reassure shareholders that they had examined their own reporting standards on supplier incentives, payments and discounts. It is standard practice for suppliers to pay supermarkets for product placement, sales targets and promotions.</p> <p>One accountant said that six of the top 10 UK supermarkets had run an internal audit in the last six years of how they recorded the cash they get from suppliers.</p> <p>\u201cMorrisons is satisfied that supplier income is calculated correctly and recognised in the appropriate period. In their report, KPMG described the work they did in their audit on supplier income and overall gave a clean opinion on the Morrisons accounts,\u201d the Bradford-based chain said in a statement.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s declined to reveal whether it was checking its systems, but said: \u201cOur accounting principles dictate that we recognise income and costs at the appropriate time and we abide by those principles.\u201d</p> <p>Sainsbury is due to update the City on its second-quarter trading next week. Black said: \u201cIt is inevitable the subject is going to be raised. Supplier payments are a feature of the retail industry in general, not just the grocery industry, and a lot of company boards will be making sure their policies on revenue recognition are robust.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Tesco\u2019s board: what retail experience do they have?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Sir Richard Broadbent</strong></p> <p><strong>Chairman</strong></p> <p>Began his career at HM Treasury before moving into investment banking and then back to Whitehall.

      "bodyText": "TNT Express, the Dutch delivery service, has issued a profit warning, blaming worsening trading conditions in Europe for scrapping its previous guidance to investors. The business-to-business delivery service has been squeezed by the continuing eurozone woes, particularly in Italy, one of its five biggest markets. Its warning follows a survey of eurozone business activity that showed companies cutting prices as business activity grew at its slowest pace this year. Business for TNT has been slower than expected and customers have opted for cheaper, slower delivery options. TNT also faces stiff competition in Germany and the UK which has partly offset stronger economic growth in those countries to date. In a trading update, the company said: \u201cSince the interim results of 28 July 2014, overall trading conditions in Europe have deteriorated further and competitive pressures have increased. This means that it is no longer prudent to maintain our 2015 guidance.\u201d TNT shares fell almost 11% to \u20ac5.01 (\u00a33.93) in mid-morning trading. TNT said its forecast of an 8% operating margin in 2015 was based on Europe\u2019s economy expanding between 2% and 3% annually. In July, the IMF maintained its forecast for eurozone growth of 1.1% for this year as it revised down its outlook for the global economy. The eurozone has remained in the economic mire despite the apparent resolution of the euro crisis that threatened to break up the single currency. Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank (ECB), on Wednesday tried to calm fears about the currency zone\u2019s economy. He said the ECB would keep monetary policy loose for a long time to support growth. Earlier this month, the ECB cut the headline eurozone interest rate to 0.05%. TNT\u2019s boss, Tex Gunning, described the profit warning as disappointing and said TNT would speed up investment and cost cutting. The company also set aside \u20ac50m to settle a French competition inquiry into the parcel delivery industry. The French authorities are also investigating Royal Mail, whose shares fell almost 1% on Wednesday morning.",

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority\u2019s most recent figures on the rates of return of superannuation funds found that in 13 of the past 15 years industry super funds outperformed retail funds. Thirteen of the 25 biggest superannuation funds are retail funds, yet only five were in the top 25 performers in 2012-13 and just one was in the top 25 for performance over the past 10 years.

The ISA\u2019s submission notes that comparing the performance of only default funds over the past 10 years shows retail default funds lagging well behind the performance of the not-for-profit industry and public sector super funds: The ISA argues that given eight out of ten people use a default fund, \u201cthe data reinforces the need for a default super safety net, where only the \u2018best of the best\u2019 super funds can be default funds\u201d.
