      "bodyText": "Shed no tears for Rakesh Kapoor, the chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser who has had \u00a311.2m deducted from his 2017 pay package. He still earned \u00a312.5m, owns shares in the Dettol-to-Durex firm worth \u00a340m and this year is chasing a \u00a322.7m maximum jackpot. He\u2019ll get along fine. No need for a Nurofen. Reckitt has too often over the years found itself defending the indefensible \u2013 remember the \u00a390m for Bart Becht, Kapoor\u2019s predecessor, in 2010 \u2013 so perhaps deserves half a cheer for remembering that discretion is allowed when a mechanical pay formula spits out an obviously silly number. In this case, Kapoor scored top marks under the terms of his 2015-17 long-term incentive plan, or LTIP. Reckitt had to achieve growth in earnings per share, ignoring the effects of acquisitions, of 10%. It achieved 11.5%. In practice, pretending that everything went swimmingly would have fooled nobody. Reckitt\u2019s share price has fallen by a quarter since last summer as the market has digested a cyber-attack, a profits warning and the acquisition of a baby milk business where the $18bn price struck many observers as far too rich. In the circumstances, handing Kapoor his full LTIP whack of \u00a322.4m would have risked a BP-style revolt by investors. Cutting the figure in half to acknowledge \u201cthe shareholder experience\u201d, in the committee\u2019s coy phrase, reduces the risk of a riot. In truth, though, Reckitt\u2019s pay committee deserves little credit. It has failed to ask the obvious question: if an LTIP scheme tied solely to earnings per share has been exposed as a dud, why is it still being used? This is the second year in a row that Kapoor\u2019s pay has had to be adjusted downwards to reflect factors that the model could not compute. Last year the boss was obliged to make a gesture to acknowledge a safety scandal with a Reckitt product in South Korea linked to the death of 92 people. Kapoor, though not in charge when the scandal happened, was docked 40% but still collected \u00a314m. Reckitt could have concluded at the time that a one-eyed focus on earnings per share is a poor way to measure performance. It is also the true that investment managers themselves, weary of an executive pay system where luck and timing often play a greater role than skill and hard work, are increasingly open to ditching LTIPs. The new chair of Reckitt\u2019s pay committee, Mary Harris, should order a review. Even by the lavish standards of large FTSE 100 companies, Kapoor is highly paid. And when the formula for calculating his rewards can\u2019t withstand contact with common sense, it\u2019s time to design a better system. Grim outlook for Conviviality \u201cThe board believe that shareholders in the company will receive little-to-nil value.\u201d That\u2019s the stark reality for investors in Conviviality, owner of the Bargain Booze and Wine Rack chains. An intended \u00a3125m rescue has flopped and a sale of assets is under way. Matthew Clark, the well-established wholesale distribution business, will probably attract interest but the rest is anybody\u2019s guess. At the start of this month Conviviality was worth \u00a3550m, making the speed of this collapse spectacular. The causes plainly run deeper than a \u00a330m tax bill that the company failed to spot. The next announcement \u2013 one trusts \u2013 will come from the Financial Reporting Council and will promise to get to the bottom of what happened. Is Shire going the way of GKN? Just as the GKN/Melrose excitement draws to a close on Thursday, here comes a bid for a bigger FTSE 100 company. The business secretary, Greg Clark, can relax, though. He won\u2019t be called upon to perform a dance. Biotech firm Shire has risen from humble origins in Basingstoke to become one of the largest companies on the London market, worth \u00a333bn, but it is Irish these days. Takeda Pharmaceutical of Japan is merely \u201cconsidering\u201d an offer that is at \u201ca preliminary and exploratory\u201d stage, a statement riddled with get-outs, but chief executive Christophe Weber, a former high-flyer at GlaxoSmithKline, sounds serious about his plan to create his vision of \u201ca truly global, value-based Japanese biopharmaceutical leader\u201d. He just needs to work out how to pay for Shire. In terms of stock market value, Takeda is the smaller company and shares in Japanese firms don\u2019t go down easily with UK fund managers. You can\u2019t blame Weber for sniffing an opportunity, though. Shire is carrying a load of debt after its $32bn purchase two years ago of the US haemophilia firm Baxalta, a deal that looks less good after the arrival of tough competition from the likes of Roche. Shire is vulnerable \u2013 to Takeda or somebody else.",

In a statement to the stock market, Conviviality said investors had refused its request for \u00a3125m of new money, which it needs to stave off bankruptcy after a string of shock profit warnings. Directors are still seeking a buyer for all or part of the business, but Conviviality is facing the prospect of going into administration, which is likely to be managed by accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. The trade body for the UK\u2019s pubs, more than 20,000 of which are supplied by the company\u2019s Matthew Clark distribution division, warned many could now face \u201cshort-term supply issues\u201d. \u201cDespite a significant number of meetings with potential investors resulting in good levels of demand, and constructive discussions with a number of key customers and suppliers regarding the provision of support, there was ultimately insufficient demand to raise the full \u00a3125m,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe board wish to thank its customers, suppliers and employees for their continued support during this difficult period for the company. \u201cThe company is in discussions with its lending banks and advisers regarding other possible options and is in receipt of a number of inbound enquiries regarding a potential sale of all or parts [of] the business.\u201d The company, which has annual sales of \u00a31.6bn, said its shareholder were likely to receive \u201clittle-to-nil\u201d value for their shares, which have been suspended on the junior AIM stock market since 14 March. Despite reporting strong sales and profits in recent trading updates, Conviviality was plunged into turmoil after a string of profit warnings issued earlier this month that saw its shares suspended. The company blamed the first profit warning on a erroneous calculation made by a member of its finance team and weakening profit margins. It later admitted it had not budgeted for a \u00a330m tax bill. Conviviality\u2019s chief executive, Diana Hunter, stepped down after City analysts criticised the company\u2019s financial controls and processes. The firm is a major player in the UK drinks industry, supplying more than 700 off-licences and serving more than 23,000 pubs and restaurants including the JD Wetherspoon chain, via its Matthew Clark and Bibendum subsidiaries. The British Beer &amp; Pub Association said: \u201cWe are working with our members to assess the impact of the ongoing issues with Conviviality who, through Matthew Clark, are significant suppliers to the pub trade. \u201cAlternative suppliers will be sought in order to minimise the impact on the trade as far as possible, but inevitably a situation like this will likely cause short term supply issues for pubs.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Bitter takeover battle for GKN comes to a head", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The fate of GKN, a 250-year-old British engineering company, will be decided on Thursday as shareholders vote on a hostile \u00a38bn bid from turnaround specialist Melrose. The biggest hostile takeover bid in the UK for nearly a decade has pitted one of Britain\u2019s largest industrial groups, which began as a south Wales ironworks in 1759, against a company set up in 2003 with the aim of buying up and turning around underperforming businesses. Both companies upped the ante in the 24 hours before Thursday\u2019s 1pm deadline for investors to cast their ballots on the controversial deal. Melrose needs 50% plus one share for acceptance and will walk away if it does not get the required support. It will have to make an announcement before 5pm. In a final appeal to investors, Melrose stressed its commitment to improving \u201cnot only GKN, but the UK economy\u201d. But GKN\u2019s chairman, Mike Turner, said the comment \u201csmacks of desperation\u201d. The government waded in this week in a last-minute intervention to demand binding commitments from Melrose, citing concerns for national security in light of GKN\u2019s work for the armed forces. In response, Melrose pledged to keep its headquarters and stock market listing in the UK for at least five years, to maintain GKN\u2019s research and development spending, and to keep its aerospace division until April 2023. Turner hit out at this \u201crushed\u201d commitment, saying Melrose had limited its strategic flexibility for the aerospace business and describing the firm as \u201cvirtual novices in aerospace\u201d. The GKN management\u2019s alternative plan is to merge its automotive arm with US firm Dana in a \u00a34.4bn deal, leaving it with its aerospace business. Melrose has accused GKN of conducting a \u201chasty fire sale\u201d. The bidder\u2019s chairman, Christopher Miller, said on Wednesday: \u201cSince we made our approach, GKN has repeatedly changed its strategy and contradicted itself. We believe this lack of candour and strategic vision indicates more than simply a management team in denial about its own abilities.\u201d It also emerged that Labour MP Jack Dromey and Conservative MP Jeremy Lefroy have written to the chief executive of HM Revenue &amp; Customs, Jon Thompson, to complain that a substantial proportion of shares in GKN are being controlled by short-term investors in such a way that they will not have to pay tax if their shares are acquired by Melrose. The two MPs expressed concerns that a chunk of the engineering group was controlled by arbitrageurs holding shares via derivatives, meaning they were not liable for stamp duty on disposal. Shareholders are divided, with those publicly backing Melrose, including Elliott Advisors and Aviva Investors, accounting for nearly 10% of the shareholder base, compared with 9% for those supporting the GKN board, including Columbia Threadneedle and Jupiter Asset Management. Hedge funds, mostly merger arbitrage funds, are estimated to control 20%-25% of GKN\u2019s shares and could tip the balance. GKN\u2019s troubles began last year when problems at its North American aerospace business prompted a series of profit warnings and led to its chief executive-designate being ousted. The subsequent fall in its share price to 294.3p in early December made the company vulnerable to a takeover bid. GKN\u2019s new chief executive, Anne Stevens, a former senior executive at US carmaker Ford, has spent the past two-and-a-half months fending off Melrose\u2019s hostile bid. The board was quick to reject its initial bid worth \u00a37bn on 12 January and has argued that the company is worth more than \u00a35 a share. But Melrose\u2019s \u201cfinal\u201d cash-and-shares offer on 12 March valued it at 462.7p, based on its share price at the close of business on Wednesday. GKN and its predecessor firms made cannonballs for the Napoleonic wars, a specialised tank for D-Day and millions of steel helmets for the second world war, as well as tracks for Brunel\u2019s Great Western Railway. Today, its components are used in the Boeing 737 jet and Black Hawk helicopter as well as Volkswagen and Ford cars. It employs 59,000 people worldwide, including 6,000 in the UK.",

      "bodyText": "The latest release of the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage (Irsad) reveals not just the wide disparities of wealth and advantage across the nation but also gives insight into why the ALP\u2019s current policies are finding traction within the electorate and the difficulties for the LNP. While measures such as income and wealth are more commonly used to record inequality across the nation, the Australian Bureau of Statistics after each census uses the data to estimate levels not just of wealth but advantage and disadvantage area by area. It does this by factoring a broad range of indicators, which are generally associated with having a more advantageous life. For example positive measures of advantage include having a household equivalised income greater than $78,000, but also the size of your mortgage, the percent of people employed as professionals, your education level and the percent of occupied dwellings with four or more bedrooms. On the other hand measures of disadvantage include such things as a lack of either internet connection or car ownership, and a high proportion of single parent families in the area. Using these measures, the ABS found the most advantageous local government area was Ku-ring-gai in Sydney\u2019s upper north shore, closely followed by fellow north shore area of Mosman and Woollahra on the southern side of the harbour. Woollahra is also within the prime minister\u2019s electorate of Wentworth which is apt as Wentworth is also the most advantageous electorate in the nation. Around 85% of the residents of Wentworth are in the top 10% of the most advantaged people in Australia. And no one is in the bottom 60%. By contrast the most disadvantaged electorate is the Tasmanian seat of Braddon held by the ALP\u2019s Justine Keay. Nearly a third of its residents are in the bottom 10% of the Irsad index: As a general rule, the ABS data shows that there is not surprisingly a high degree of correlation between areas of socioeconomic advantage and income. The ABS also provides an index of economic resources. This is a much more targeted index which does not include education and occupation data and has greater emphasis on income and housing status: But the difference between the two measures does provide some insight into the reasons why the ALP\u2019s policies targeting inequality and housing affordability are having such resonance with voters. Of the 20 electorates with the greatest level of people in the top 30% of advantage, 16 are held by the Liberal party, three are held by the ALP and one \u2013 the seat of Melbourne \u2013 is held by the Greens. And yet those four non-Liberal party seats all score much lower in terms of \u201ceconomic resources\u201d: The reason is those seats are all in the inner city, which means they score lowly on measures such as number of four-bedroom homes and the percentage of people who are either paying off a mortgage or who own their house outright. In effect while such areas do well in terms of advantage of education, occupation and even income, they do less well in terms of house ownership. These are people for whom housing affordability is the key issue, rather than those who are more concerned about increasing the value of their house. By contrast the 20 electorates with the highest percentage of people in the bottom 30% of advantage are a mixture of ALP, Liberal party, and very much National party, rural seats: This is because of low levels of internet access and education, and higher levels of unemployment. It is for that reason that despite how much Barnaby Joyce might think that upping sticks and moving to his electorate of New England is the way to go, most people do not. New England incidentally is the electorate with the 21st highest percentage of people in the bottom 30% of advantage. But where it gets interesting is when we compare the level of advantage across the safe and marginal ALP and LNP seats. Across the 26 seats the ALP holds with more than 60% of the two-party-preferred vote, there is a skew towards the lower ends of socio-economic advantage. On average 41% of residents in safe ALP seats are in the bottom 30% of advantage. But the skew in the safe LNP seats is much more obvious and much more at the other end of the scale. Nearly half of residents in 31 safe Liberal party seats are in the top 30% of advantage, with nearly a quarter alone in the top 10%: Marginal seats however are much more reflective of the national average. Among the ALP and LNP marginally held seats, there is only a slight derivation from the national average of 10% in each decile of advantage. The biggest drop off is in the highest decile of advantage in marginally held LNP seats. These seats comprise semi-rural/rural seats such as Leichhardt, Flynn and Page which have very low levels of people in the top 10% of advantage. The LNP policies that speak to its base are thus those aimed more at wealth and high income earners. But the marginal seats of both parties have much more equitable distribution of people with advantage. In safe Liberal party seats, only 21% of people are with the middle three deciles of advantage \u2013 they actually under-represent \u201cmiddle Australia\u201d. By contrast, 31% of those living in safe ALP seats are with those middle three deciles \u2013 a similar level to that in both ALP and LNP marginal seats. For these seats housing affordability, internet access, and the ability to send their child to higher education are all aspects that resonate as they would deliver higher levels of advantage. For now, with its emphasis of company tax cuts, the LNP has been speaking much more to its base than its marginal seats, while the ALP with its polices has been able to speak well to both.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of the firm behind household brands ranging from Dettol to Durex has had his pay slashed by \u00a311m \u2013 but will still pocket \u00a312.5m in salary and bonuses. Rakesh Kapoor, chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser, was entitled to a pay packet worth \u00a323.7m under the terms of his contract but the company said he had volunteered to give some of it back because the company\u2019s recent performance had not been exceptional. The share price has tumbled from \u00a381 to \u00a359 in the last nine months. The FTSE 100 firm\u2019s remuneration committee, which sets the pay of its executives, decided he should hand back half of his long-term incentive pay, a bonus reflecting performance between 2014 and 2017. The decision, which cost Kapoor \u00a311m, followed conversations with Reckitt Benckiser shareholders, some of whom expressed concern that the company\u2019s pay policy permits excessive payouts. The remuneration committee is also thought to have taken public opinion into account, following recent outcry over \u00a3110m handed to the boss of housebuilder Persimmon, a deal described as obscene by Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable. Mary Harris, who has been reviewing Reckitt\u2019s pay policy since becoming remuneration committee chair in November 2017, said: \u201cAt RB we pay for performance. \u201cAlthough shareholders enjoyed \u00a316bn in value creation over the period, which demonstrates our performance culture, we recognised that 2017 was a challenging year. \u201cThe CEO volunteered a cut to the vesting outcomes as the committee deemed fit. Based on the committee\u2019s rigorous evaluation of performance in the round and alignment of pay outcomes, we then exercised our discretion to reduce the vesting outcome.\u201d Harris is preparing to overhaul the company\u2019s executive pay structure after sounding out shareholders during a two-day roadshow after taking the position. While next year\u2019s bonus will be calculated under the same terms, the maximum pot available to the company\u2019s executives after that is expected to fall. Reckitt has a history of attracting criticism for high pay deals, with Kapoor\u2019s predecessor Bart Becht coming under fire in 2010 over a pay-and-shares deal worth more than \u00a390m. Stefan Stern, director of the remuneration thinktank High Pay Centre, said: \u201cIn a way it\u2019s encouraging if both the board and the chief executive are recognising that the potential payout was far too big. \u201cThere\u2019s a glimmer of reality dawning in this otherwise dark world of excessive pay. It does also reveal the fact that the contract he was on, and these elaborate and pseudo-sophisticated pay contracts are hopelessly flawed if, when you tap all the numbers in and hit return, it comes up with a number that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Kapoor was entitled to a pay-and-bonus deal worth \u00a323.7m based on growth in the company\u2019s earnings per share of more than 10% over the three years from 2014 to 2017. But the company\u2019s recent poor share price performance is thought to have been a key factor in convincing Kapoor that he could not accept the full sum. Shares in Reckitt, which also makes Nurofen, Clearasil and Veet, have fallen from \u00a368 at the beginning of 2017 to less than \u00a360 on Wednesday, the day the pay figure was released. The decline follows a difficult year for Reckitt when it was hit by sluggish market conditions as well as several factors specific to the company that led to it undershooting profit forecasts. It suffered a boycott of its products in South Korea after a 2016 scandal that saw it pay \u00a3300m to the relatives of people who suffered illness and fatal lung injuries linked to humidifier sterilisers sold by the company. That affair saw Kapoor\u2019s pay slashed for 2016 cut from \u00a325.5m to \u00a314.6m, even though he was not in charge of the company when the products were sold. Reckitt also suffered a cyber-attack in 2017, while sales were affected by low demand for expensive footcare products in its Scholl division, including the Velvet Smooth Electronic Foot File.",

      "bodyText": "The UK retail industry has warned it could cost \u00a31bn to implement the government\u2019s plan to charge deposits on drinks cans and bottles. Britain\u2019s biggest supermarkets signalled a willingness to work with the environment secretary, Michael Gove, on the scheme, which would result in consumers in England getting the deposit back if they returned the empty drinks containers to stores. However, retailers warned there was much work to be done on how a deposit return system (DRS) would work in practice, after Gove announced the broad outline of the plan but provided little detail. A spokesperson for Tesco said: \u201cWe support a cost-effective deposit return system and are working with a number of partners to explore how this can operate at scale. DRS is one part of the holistic approach that is needed to reduce waste and increase recycling in the UK.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Marks &amp; Spencer said they were also open to working with the government on the proposals. Key issues that have yet to be addressed include who would pay for the scheme, where the planned \u201creverse vending machines\u201d for returning containers would be placed and whether customers would be able to return bottles and cans to any retailer, irrespective of where they bought them. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), the trade body for UK retailers, has estimated it would cost \u00a3900m-\u00a31bn to install machines at stores across England. It urged ministers to work with the Scottish government, which announced plans for a DRS in September. \u201cWe are pleased the government has said any scheme will be based on evidence and any costs for consumers and retailers will be proportionate,\u201d said Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability policy at the BRC. \u201cIt is important it co-ordinates work with the Scottish government, which is further ahead with its planning. The government needs to be creative in its thinking, for example, by using municipal sites and not just shops in town centres to tackle littering.\u201d Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said the industry welcomed the opportunity to contribute to the government\u2019s consultation, which is expected to begin later this year. However, the Society of Independent Brewers (Siba), which represents more than 800 independent craft brewers in the UK, said it was concerned that small businesses would be burdened with additional costs. James Calder, head of public affairs at Siba, said: \u201cSmall brewers are conscious of their environmental impact and moves to encourage recycling and reduce waste and pollution are welcome. \u201cBut Siba members, as relatively small businesses when compared to international mega brewers, are disproportionately burdened by added costs, so any deposit scheme needs to be appropriately targeted and mitigated to ensure this undue burden is minimised.\u201d Countries such as Germany, Sweden and Denmark operate their own versions of a deposit return scheme and have higher recycling rates than the UK. In Britain, just 43% of the 13bn plastic bottles sold each year are recycled and 700,000 turn up as litter every day. In Germany, where a DRS was introduced in 2003, 99% of plastic bottles are recycled.",

      "bodyText": "High street sales slumped at the fastest rate for early spring in at least five years, as freezing conditions caused by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d sweeping in from Siberia kept people away from the shops. The CBI\u2019s survey found a sharp decline in sales volumes triggered by the poor weather, with 40% of retailers reporting that sales volumes were down in March compared with the same month a year ago. Sales for the time of year have not been this weak since April 2013, according to the survey of 109 firms, while online sales figures were also the weakest in almost a decade as customers were reluctant to place orders for fear deliveries would be delayed. The bleak snapshot of high street trading provided by the CBI showed department stores, shops selling recreational goods and furniture retailers experienced some of the biggest falls in sales. Grocers, footwear shops, and hardware and DIY outlets had a better month, reporting positive sales growth. Ben Jones, the CBI\u2019s principal economist, said retailers were suffering as consumers found themselves squeezed by weak wage growth and rising inflation, which was triggered by the drop in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote. \u201cThe lengthy cold snap earlier this month has heaped added pressure on retailers,\u201d he said. \u201cFreezing conditions and transport disruption caused people to avoid the high street.\u201d Although telecoms firms enjoyed record internet traffic during the month as many people were forced to work from home, there was no boon for online retailers as consumers feared deliveries could be delayed because of the snow. Wholesalers and motor traders also felt the chill, with both sectors reporting noticeable slowdowns in sales growth in the year to March. Despite the poor month, the CBI survey shows most retailers expect conditions to get better over the coming months as the weather improves. The slowdown for March is likely to compound fears among economists that the cold weather will have caused economic activity to slow in the first three months of the year. Gridlocked motorways, empty restaurants and idle diggers across Britain are thought to have cost the economy at least \u00a31bn a day and could halve GDP growth in the first quarter. There will be hopes that the slowdown for consumer spending could ease over the coming months as inflation begins to fade and wage growth begins to accelerate amid record low levels of unemployment. The latest report from the Bank of England\u2019s network of regional agents, published on Wednesday, suggested companies across the country were awarding annual pay rises worth as much as 3.5% during the first three months of 2018 \u2013 above the most recent level recorded for inflation of 2.7% in February.",

Labour MP Jack Dromey, who represents Birmingham Erdington, and Conservative MP Jeremy Lefroy, who represents Stafford, told the chief executive of HM Revenue &amp; Customs, Jon Thompson, they were unhappy that a chunk of the engineering group was controlled by arbitrageurs holding shares via derivatives, meaning they were not liable for stamp duty on disposal. \u201cWhat is of particular concern, however, is that the fate of GKN could well be decided by a group of predatory short-term investors who have no interests in the sustainability of the business beyond the next few weeks. There are now reports that these same short-term funds will make this decision without paying stamp duty on their shares,\u201d the two wrote. The letter represents a last-minute political intervention as the deadline for Melrose\u2019s \u00a37.8bn hostile bid looms. The closely fought takeover battle concludes at 1pm on Thursday, with the situation finely balanced. GKN and its political supporters have argued that turnaround specialist Melrose has a short-term approach and will restructure GKN and sell it on in parts over the next three to five years; Melrose counters by saying it has a proven record in building shareholder value. Ministers have faced demands from both backbench Labour and Conservative MPs to intervene and refer the bid to the Competition and Markets Authority. However, on Tuesday the business secretary, Greg Clark, said he had won a commitment from Melrose to agree to remain headquartered in the UK and to retain ownership of GKN\u2019s aerospace division until April 2023, although critics said these pledges were not formally binding. GKN is one of Britain\u2019s oldest industrial companies, tracing its roots back to 1759, and predecessor firms made cannonballs for the Battle of Waterloo and supplied tracks for Brunel\u2019s Great Western Railway. It employs 60,000 staff around the world and 6,000 in the UK. The two MPs also demanded that tax officials mount an \u201curgent investigation into shareholder dealings in this transaction\u201d and called on HMRC to \u201cvigorously pursue all stamp duty owed\u201d. They also asked Thompson to respond with urgency given that the bid deadline was so close.",

      "bodyText": "It was another volatile session for stock markets. After Tuesday\u2019s slump on Wall Street, driven predominantly by sharp declines in technology stocks, European markets opened mostly lower. However they came off their worst levels as the US market managed to stage a mild recovery, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently marginally in positive territory, up 35 points, although the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down around 1%. Amazon in particular is being hit by reports that the US president plans to go after the company and altering its tax treatment. The FTSE 100, now up around 9 points, was supported by news of a potential bid for UK listed pharmaceutical group Shire from Japan\u2019s Takeda. Shire\u2019s shares jumped, valuing the company at more than \u00a335bn at one point. Elsewhere there was more bad news for the UK high street, with retail sales falling in March for the first time since October, according to the CBI. But the US economy grew more strongly than expected in the final quarter. And there was a positive report on the eurozone economy from S&amp;P Global ratings. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back with Shire, and Ketan Patel at EdenTree Investment Management says it could be a key moment if a deal goes ahead: If a bid does materialise from Takeda for drug maker Shire, it would be a watershed moment for Japanese pharma. There hasn\u2019t been a cross border transaction in the sector, excluding joint ventures and small generic M&amp;A. Takeda\u2019s cash laden balance sheet appears a good fit for Shire\u2019s struggling balance sheet, following recent large scale M&amp;A. The attraction for Takeda is the highly lucrative rare disease market in the US, which comes with exceedingly high margins and is largely exempt from the usual pricing pressure that affects the wider pharmaceutical sector. After Tuesday\u2019s tech-inspired slump, there is little respite for the sector despite US markets generally starting the day on a slightly more positive note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 121 points or 0.53% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 has edged up 0.05%. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has opened down 0.35%. The stronger than expected US GDP figure will revive talk about how many interest rate rises the Federal Reserve will sanction this year. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending have been attributed to today\u2019s stronger than expected US GDP data, as the country\u2019s economic outlook appears in rude health and the 3% growth target appears within touching distance. ...As a result of the strong economic outlook, questions may be raised around the possibility of Fed Chair Jerome Powell introducing a June rate hike. It may be a case of US growth being monitored before any rate decision is made, but markets could be volatile between now and then. The 2.9% growth in the US economy, although better than the initial estimates, shows a slowdown from the 3.2% rise recorded in the third quarter. The figures were helped by the biggest rise in consumer spending for three years, offset by a surge in imports. The Bureau of Economic Analysis said: The increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, residential fixed investment, state and local government spending, and federal government spending that were partly offset by a negative contribution from private inventory investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. Breaking news: Something for Donald Trump to tweet about. The US economy grew more strongly than expected in the final quarter, up 2.9% on an annualised basis compared to expectations of a 2.7% increase and an initial estimate of 2.5% growth. Here\u2019s some analyst reaction to the possible Shire deal. Peter Welford at Jefferies says the structure of any deal is uncertain: We see the potential strategic rationale for the deal and have long highlighted Shire is currently trading at a substantial discount to our fundamental 4300p or so value given overhangs, notably haemophilia competitive concerns. Nevertheless Takeda\u2019s near.$42bn market cap versus Shire\u2019s $47bn or $66bn enterprise value raises questions on a potential deal structure.... We presume Takeda would need a significant equity raise to acquire Shire, suggesting a \u201cmerger\u201d is perhaps better terminology, which may raise hurdles to the successful completion of any future deal. Jack Scannell at UBS says other bidders could emerge: Since Takeda\u2019s market cap is close to Shire\u2019s we assume a potential offer would have to include a substantial percentage in equity and how Shire\u2019s board and shareholders would react is hard to predict. However as Shire\u2019s share price is significantly below the net present value of our cash flow estimates, Takeda could trigger discussion of other bidders. Shire does not strike us as an obvious take-over candidate. There is presumably a price at which the financial engineering would work. However, Shire\u2019s specialty focus and mix of therapeutic foci means that most buyers would struggle to extract substantial operational synergies while escaping from competition problems, in our view. Also Shire\u2019s low corporate tax rate could rise in most scenarios were the company acquired. It would also be a bold acquisition in our view given the uncertain trajectory of Shire\u2019s haemophilia business. A merger of equals in this context might be more feasible. The potential offer for Shire has helped the FTSE 100 come off its worst levels after the morning\u2019s earlier declines. The UK\u2019s leading index is now down just 0.12% or around 8 points, with Shire up 18% and fellow drugs group GlaxoSmithKline 1.5% better. Elsewhere though the fallout from the US tech slump continues. Germany\u2019s Dax remains down 0.7%, while France\u2019s Cac is 0.9% lower. Meanwhile US futures are suggesting a rebound of sorts on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average forecast to open around 67 points higher. Here\u2019s our story on the possible takeover of Shire by Japan\u2019s Takeda: Shares in the UK-listed drugmaker Shire surged after Japan\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company, Takeda Pharmaceutical, said it was considering making a takeover approach. Shire\u2019s shares jumped as much as 33% to \u00a338.79 on the news, and later traded 17% higher at \u00a336, valuing the company at \u00a332.8bn. Takeda\u2019s market value is about \u00a329bn, around the same as Shire\u2019s at last night\u2019s closing price. Shire is best known for its ADHD drug Adderall but its focus in recent years has been on rare diseases. The company is based in Dublin for tax purposes but run from Boston. Most of its operations are in the US. The news comes three-and-a-half years after US firm AbbVie abandoned its agreed $54bn (\u00a334bn) takeover of Shire, after a US clampdown on so-called tax inversions by US companies buying an overseas business to secure a lower tax rate. Shire then turned acquiror and completed its $32bn purchase of US firm Baxalta last June. In November it reported a drop in sales of haemophilia drugs, which became its biggest source of revenue following the deal. The full report is here: Here is the full statement from Takeda, which includes more detail of the Japanese company\u2019s thinking: Takeda believes that a potential transaction with Shire presents an opportunity to advance Takeda\u2019s stated Vision 2025, build on its current strong momentum, and create a truly global, value-based Japanese biopharmaceutical leader. In particular, a transaction with Shire would: \u00b7 strengthen Takeda\u2019s core therapeutic areas of oncology, GI and neuroscience \u00b7 accelerate Takeda\u2019s vision to be a leader in specialized medicines that are transformative to patients through the addition of Shire\u2019s leading global rare disease franchise \u00b7 further enhance Takeda\u2019s robust R&amp;D strategy, concentrating on key therapeutic areas \u00b7 reinforce a strong and large-molecule focused late-stage pipeline within Takeda\u2019s core therapeutic areas to complement Takeda\u2019s own pipeline and discovery capabilities \u00b7 balance Takeda\u2019s geographic focus to align with the market opportunity in the U.S. \u00b7 drive financial value from a strong combined financial profile Clearly defined strategic and financial objectives are core to Takeda\u2019s disciplined approach to acquisitions, including in relation to its dividend policy and credit rating, which are well-established. Any potential offer for Shire, if made, would have to align with this strict investment criteria. Back to Shire: More from the CBI\u2019s high street survey: More bad news for the high street, with a new survey showing a slump in sales this month. Reuters reports: British retail sales fell for the first time in five months in March as heavy snowfall combined with the financial strains on many households, a survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed on Wednesday. The CBI distributive trades survey\u2019s retail sales balance fell to -8 from +8 in February, confounding a median forecast of +15 in a Reuters poll of economists. \u201cAgainst a backdrop of stagnating household incomes and weak consumer confidence, the lengthy cold snap earlier this month has heaped added pressure on retailers,\u201d Ben Jones, a CBI economist, said. \u201cFreezing conditions and transport disruption caused people to avoid the high street. With many forced to work from home, telecoms firms saw record internet traffic, yet on-line shopping slowed sharply given the potential for disrupted deliveries.\u201d A measure of sales for the time of year was the weakest since April 2013, the survey showed. Retailers expected sales volumes and orders to grow in April but only at a subdued pace. Elsewhere, the latest report from the Bank of England\u2019s network of regional agents has just come out with some good news to cheer British workers. Used to detect early warning signs for the economy, the quarterly report compiles the views of businesses recorded by the Bank\u2019s 12 regional outposts. In their latest assessment, the agents say companies are handing out pay rises worth between 2.5% and 3.5% - which would be inflation-busting for staff at the top end of that range. Firms are also telling the agents inflation is beginning to fade. Elsewhere in the report for the first three months of the year, there\u2019s an interesting look at how company chief executives are preparing for Brexit. Apparently, two fifths from more than 3,000 firms surveyed are not spending any time at all each week on Brexit. They had better hope the government\u2019s transitional arrangements, agreed in principal earlier this month, will help smooth the process as advertised. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a contrarian view over the collapse of Carillion. Far from being the disaster for the wider construction industry forecast by experts, firms tell the agents it hasn\u2019t had much of an impact at all. There has been \u201clittle evidence of a significant impact on the supply chain or on the availability of credit to the sector\u201d so far, the agents report. Shire shares - which climbed as high as \u00a338.79 on news of the possible approach by Takeda - have come off their best levels. The rather conditional nature of the Japanese statement means Shire is now at \u00a335.45, still 15% better on the day. Takeda says it is at a preliminary and exploratory stage in considering a bid, and no approach has been made to the Shire board. Meanwhile Takeda - Japan\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company - is worth some \u00a329bn. This is less than Shire\u2019s value after today\u2019s jump, but around the same as the UK-listed company was worth at last night\u2019s closing price. Shire is worth \u00a335bn after its shares jumped to \u00a338 on the news of Takeda\u2019s possible approach. Breaking news: Pharmaceutical group Shire has soared 25% after Japan\u2019s Takeda says it is considering making a takeover approach to the company. Takeda has until 5pm on 25 April to decide whether to make a firm bid or walk away. The Easter break couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time for stock markets, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at GKFX: Investors were already on edge having been shocked by February\u2019s equity sell-off triggered by the dual spike in volatility and bond yields. Despite a strong rebound, the major stock indices remain fragile with many in danger of breaking back below some major technical levels \u2013 in particular, the lower level of the S&amp;P\u2019s bullish trendline advance since February 2016. This has been brought sharply into focus with the sell-off in tech stocks, which have lead the market rally for so long, catalysed by the scandal surrounding Facebook\u2019s cavalier attitude to its users\u2019 data. Now we have a long holiday weekend which coincides with the close of the first quarter. Once again, bonds are in focus \u2013 particularly the US 10-year Treasury. But this time yields have slumped with the 10-year crashing back below the key 2.80% level which has held as support for the past six weeks. Investors are piling back into the perceived \u201csafe haven\u201d of fixed income as stock markets slide... And this comes against a backdrop of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, concerns over the outbreak of trade wars and worries about changes in key White House personnel leading to a more hawkish foreign policy. All-in-all, investors will see plenty of reasons to reduce equity exposure as we head into the weekend. Markets could be in for a run of volatility similar to the summer of 2015, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Markets remain under pressure as the sell-off in tech spreads once more to the wider equities space. The bounce on Tuesday looks like a flash in the pan, with more and more investors heading to the exit. It is looking increasingly likely that we have a re-run of August 2015 on our hands; equities then had months of volatility to contend with before the rally resumed. With trade wars and the tech scandal weighing on sentiment we may well have more downside to content with... The rout in global growth stocks has been seen in the falls in mining and bank names in London. Particularly hard hit among the banks are the Asia-focussed giants HSBC and Standard Chartered, while miners have seen further outflows as investors downgrade their optimistic views on global economic expansion. Oil prices are on the slide after a surprise rise in US stockpiles. Brent crude is currently down 0.6% at $69.68 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 1% lower at $64.6. The American Petroleum Institute said late on Tuesday that US weekly crude stocks had risen unexpectedly by 5.3m barrels to 430.6m barrels. Here\u2019s an interesting chart on market bubbles: The eurozone is seeing steady economic growth, thanks to a revival in world trade, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings. In a new report, the agency says: Global momentum has lifted the eurozone\u2019s economic prospects, and it now appears to have reached cruising altitude. The economic and monetary union closed 2017 on a high note, with GDP growth at 2.5%, its fastest pace in a decade. ...S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 economists say the chief reason for this is the revival of world trade, which has put the eurozone\u2019s industries back in motion. Capacity utilization was just short of its 2007 high, triggering stronger investment and boosting industry prospects for this year. However, the general fall in sentiment surveys at the start of 2018 indicates that eurozone growth is leveling off. Firms are increasingly reporting that supply constraints, rather than demand, are a drag on output. Nonetheless, for now, we expect the growth momentum will stay solid, thanks to the broad-based economic expansion and strong domestic fundamentals. It added: Strong fundamentals in the eurozone suggest that economic expansion will continue at a brisk pace, and we have raised our GDP growth forecasts for the region to 2.3% this year and 1.9% in 2019. We\u2019ve also raised our euro-dollar exchange rate forecast to $1.27 in 2018 and $1.3 in 2019, since we expect the dollar\u2019s weakness will persist. The current growth cycle appears to have peaked, but the remaining slack in the labor market and productivity rebound will keep inflationary pressures in check until the end of 2019. Because inflation will likely remain subdued this year, we expect the ECB will only gradually wind down its asset purchase program from September until the end of this year. As the gap between structural and real unemployment diminishes, earnings growth will accelerate. Thus, we think underlying inflation is set to move closer to the ECB\u2019s target at the end of 2019, giving the ECB enough leeway to raise rates in Q3 2019. Meanwhile the pound is edging higher, up 0.16% against the dollar at $1.4177 and 0.21% better against the euro at \u20ac1.1430. Lee Hardman, currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said: The ongoing reduction in Brexit risks and more hawkish outlook for Bank of England policy are the key drivers behind the pound\u2019s upward momentum. The pound has derived some additional support from a report that Irish officials have been told to expect new plans \u201cimminently\u201d on how Britain plans to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland. While short on details, the report has further boosted confidence that the UK and EU can find a workable and timely solution to the Irish border issue to support plans for a \u201csmooth &amp; orderly Brexit\u201d. Nevertheless, it still remains a potential banana skin for the pound in the coming months if intensified Brexit talks do not progress as well as hoped. Among the day\u2019s company news, furniture group DFS has bucked the gloom in the high street with an upbeat outlook. It reported a 7.4% fall in underlying half year profits to \u00a330m, in line with expectations, and chief executive Ian Filby said: We have seen a strengthening trading performance across the first half of the financial year and through February into March. We therefore remain confident that, despite the current challenging market conditions, the group will deliver modest growth in [earnings] and generate strong cashflow across this financial year, in line with our expectations. Analysts at Stifel issued a buy note, saying: Management is striking a confident tone today (despite a challenging market), as the group heads into an easier comparison phase....The shares were pricing in bad news, so we\u2019d expect to see a decent relief rally today. Indeed the shares are up nearly 6% in early trading. Stifel added We still believe in the long-term attractions of DFS Furniture. It is a highly cash generative market leader, which is consolidating the physical market at the same time as some online pure players re-evaluate their business models. More on the tech fallout, which saw the US FANG stocks have their worst day for more than two years. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: The tech sector is predominantly getting battered, mainly due to the woes of Facebook\u2019s data breach. We clearly have three kind of investors when it comes to the Facebook; firstly there are some who are jumping out of the ship, pushing the stock price lower. Secondly, we have investors who are watching the show from the sideline and thinking there is more pain to come as we do not know how big the potential fine could be. This is not helping the stock price either. Finally, we have those who are not interested in Facebook anymore as they think that the regulatory burdensome on Facebook is too risky for their appetite and they do not want to get involved in this stock. We personally think, that Facebook has strong fundamentals and it has become the part of everyone\u2019s daily life, so once we have a clear idea about the potential sum which the firm would have to pay as a result of this situation, the stock price could present a potential opportunity. As for the FANG stock including Microsoft, Twitter, it is likely that the Facebook incident would open the door for more scrutiny for other firms, and lawmakers would see how other firms are using user data. This could really open the can of worms and open a potential opportunity for short sellers. Following the falls on Wall Street and in Asia, European markets have indeed dropped back in early trading. The FTSE 100 is down 0.7%, with software group Sage slipping 1.8% and mining shares also among the leading fallers. France\u2019s Cac and Spain\u2019s Ibex have fallen 0.9% while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is 0.88% lower. In Germany, the Dax has dropped 0.77%. In the wake of the decline of the US technology stocks, Europe\u2019s tech index is down 1.1%. Here are IG\u2019s opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. An early rally on Wall Street went south by the close of play yesterday, and the turnaround is likely to weigh on European markets at today\u2019s open. Relief that the US and China appeared to be talking about averting a damaging trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies had given some support to markets. But a tech turnaround saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop 1.4% while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.93% and the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.73%. The so-called FANG technology stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) were under pressure on fears of growing regulation in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Tesla was also a big faller, down more than 8% on news of a Federal investigation into a fatal crash in California. The drop in the US filtered through to Asia, with the NIkkei 225 down 1.4% and the Hang Seng 1.57% lower. In Europe the FTSE 100 is forecast to open down around 50 points, back below 7000, while Germany\u2019s Dax could drop 120 points after European markets ended higher on Tuesday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: For all the gains seen in US markets over the past 18 months the bulk of these have been driven by tech stocks, and yesterday these tech stocks swooned quite sharply, reversing a good proportion of Monday\u2019s gains, in the process dragging the S&amp;P500 back down towards its 200 day moving average. This rolling over in tech stocks looks set to weigh on European markets this morning, with a lower open as markets mull over the potential for uncertainty over a tech sector that could catch a cold as a result of Facebook\u2019s woes around user data. With the increasing focus on what is going with respect to how Facebook has managed its users personal data, it must surely be only a matter of time before attention turns to the rest of the tech sector, and how companies like Alphabet, Twitter, Microsoft and Apple to name a few, manage their own users personal data. If lawmakers do turn their attention to the rest of the sector, which seems likely, then it is hard not to see how other tech companies will escape scrutiny on how they use this user data, raising the prospect that we could uncover other practices that invite scrutiny. In the run-up to the Easter break there is a smattering of economic news in the form of the CBI\u2019s monthly snapshot of the retail sector and the latest US GDP figures. The US economy is expected to have grown by 2.7% in the fourth quarter on an annualised basis, up from 2.5%. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said: The economic backdrop was supportive in the last quarter of 2017. Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending comfortably propped up the economy, which is expected to be reflected in an upwards revision for economic growth to 2.7% on an annualised basis from 2.5% in the previous estimate. The reading will not yet include the benefits from the tax cuts, nor the more recent uncertainties over global trade. However, given how quiet the economic calendar is, the reading is expected to attract attention anyway. A surprise to the upside, could boost the possibility of a June rate hike up from the CME FedWatch odds of 78%, lifting the dollar back towards 90.00. On the contrary, should growth remain around 2.5%, we could see buying demand for the dollar decline and the greenback look to test 89.00 once more.

Nevertheless Takeda\u2019s near.$42bn market cap versus Shire\u2019s $47bn or $66bn enterprise value raises questions on a potential deal structure....</p> <p>We presume Takeda would need a significant equity raise to acquire Shire, suggesting a \u201cmerger\u201d is perhaps better terminology, which may raise hurdles to the successful completion of any future deal.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jack Scannell at UBS says other bidders could emerge:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since Takeda\u2019s market cap is close to Shire\u2019s we assume a potential offer would have to include a substantial percentage in equity and how Shire\u2019s board and shareholders would react is hard to predict. However as Shire\u2019s share price is significantly below the net present value of our cash flow estimates, Takeda could trigger discussion of other bidders.</p> <p> Shire does not strike us as an obvious take-over candidate. There is presumably a price at which the financial engineering would work. However, Shire\u2019s specialty focus and mix of therapeutic foci means that most buyers would struggle to extract substantial operational synergies while escaping from competition problems, in our view. Also Shire\u2019s low corporate tax rate could rise in most scenarios were the company acquired. It would also be a bold acquisition in our view given the uncertain trajectory of Shire\u2019s haemophilia business. A merger of equals in this context might be more feasible.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-03-28T12:15:53.943Z\">at 1.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5abb7826e4b0ea82609d1836\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-28T11:13:46.699Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The potential offer for Shire has helped the FTSE 100 come off its worst levels after the morning\u2019s earlier declines.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s leading index is now down just 0.12% or around 8 points, with Shire up 18% and fellow drugs group GlaxoSmithKline 1.5% better.</p> <p>Elsewhere though the fallout from the US tech slump continues.

In a new report, the agency says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Global momentum has lifted the eurozone\u2019s economic prospects, and it now appears to have reached cruising altitude. The economic and monetary union closed 2017 on a high note, with GDP growth at 2.5%, its fastest pace in a decade.</p> <p>...S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 economists say the chief reason for this is the revival of world trade, which has put the eurozone\u2019s industries back in motion. Capacity utilization was just short of its 2007 high, triggering stronger investment and boosting industry prospects for this year.</p> <p>However, the general fall in sentiment surveys at the start of 2018 indicates that eurozone growth is leveling off. Firms are increasingly reporting that supply constraints, rather than demand, are a drag on output. Nonetheless, for now, we expect the growth momentum will stay solid, thanks to the broad-based economic expansion and strong domestic fundamentals.</p> </blockquote> <p>It added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Strong fundamentals in the eurozone suggest that economic expansion will continue at a brisk pace, and we have raised our GDP growth forecasts for the region to 2.3% this year and 1.9% in 2019.</p> <p>We\u2019ve also raised our euro-dollar exchange rate forecast to $1.27 in 2018 and $1.3 in 2019, since we expect the dollar\u2019s weakness will persist.</p> <p>The current growth cycle appears to have peaked, but the remaining slack in the labor market and productivity rebound will keep inflationary pressures in check until the end of 2019.</p> <p>Because inflation will likely remain subdued this year, we expect the ECB will only gradually wind down its asset purchase program from September until the end of this year. As the gap between structural and real unemployment diminishes, earnings growth will accelerate. Thus, we think underlying inflation is set to move closer to the ECB\u2019s target at the end of 2019, giving the ECB enough leeway to raise rates in Q3 2019.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5abb4edde4b0ea82609d1665\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-28T08:14:25.264Z\">9.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/neilwilson_etx/status/978906437593325569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ftse100?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ftse100</a> under pressure, trend support being tested, touch here could signal a chance to rally? <a href=\"https://t.co/FAa65abmtJ\">pic.twitter.com/FAa65abmtJ</a></p>&mdash; Neil Wilson (@neilwilson_etx) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neilwilson_etx/status/978906437593325569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 28, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5abb4c34e4b0ee234a057697\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-28T08:06:39.350Z\">9.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile the pound is edging higher, up 0.16% against the dollar at $1.4177 and 0.21% better against the euro at \u20ac1.1430.

But a tech turnaround saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop 1.4% while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.93% and the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.73%.</p> <p>The so-called FANG technology stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) were under pressure on fears of growing regulation in the wake of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\"> the Cambridge Analytica revelations. </a>Tesla was also a big faller, down more than 8% on news of a Federal investigation into a fatal crash in California. </p> <p>The drop in the US filtered through to Asia, with the NIkkei 225 down 1.4% and the Hang Seng 1.57% lower.</p> <p>In Europe the FTSE 100 is forecast to open down around 50 points, back below 7000, while Germany\u2019s Dax could drop 120 points after European markets ended higher on Tuesday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For all the gains seen in US markets over the past 18 months the bulk of these have been driven by tech stocks, and yesterday these tech stocks swooned quite sharply, reversing a good proportion of Monday\u2019s gains, in the process dragging the S&amp;P500 back down towards its 200 day moving average. </p> <p>This rolling over in tech stocks looks set to weigh on European markets this morning, with a lower open as markets mull over the potential for uncertainty over a tech sector that could catch a cold as a result of Facebook\u2019s woes around user data. </p> <p>With the increasing focus on what is going with respect to how Facebook has managed its users personal data, it must surely be only a matter of time before attention turns to the rest of the tech sector, and how companies like Alphabet, Twitter, Microsoft and Apple to name a few, manage their own users personal data. If lawmakers do turn their attention to the rest of the sector, which seems likely, then it is hard not to see how other tech companies will escape scrutiny on how they use this user data, raising the prospect that we could uncover other practices that invite scrutiny.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the run-up to the Easter break there is a smattering of economic news in the form of the CBI\u2019s monthly snapshot of the retail sector and the latest US GDP figures. The US economy is expected to have grown by 2.7% in the fourth quarter on an annualised basis, up from 2.5%. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The economic backdrop was supportive in the last quarter of 2017. Robust jobs growth and healthy consumer spending comfortably propped up the economy, which is expected to be reflected in an upwards revision for economic growth to 2.7% on an annualised basis from 2.5% in the previous estimate. The reading will not yet include the benefits from the tax cuts, nor the more recent uncertainties over global trade. However, given how quiet the economic calendar is, the reading is expected to attract attention anyway.</p> <p>A surprise to the upside, could boost the possibility of a June rate hike up from the CME FedWatch odds of 78%, lifting the dollar back towards 90.00. On the contrary, should growth remain around 2.5%, we could see buying demand for the dollar decline and the greenback look to test 89.00 once more.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The agenda:</strong></p> <p>11.00 BST: CBI distributive trades survey</p> <p>13.30 BST: US fourth quarter GDP</p> </div>   </div>",

Takeda\u2019s market value is about \u00a329bn, around the same as Shire\u2019s at Tuesday night\u2019s closing price. Shire, founded in Basingstoke, Hampshire, in 1986, is best known for its ADHD drug Adderall but its focus in recent years has been on rare diseases. The company is based in Dublin for tax purposes but run from Boston. It has scaled back its presence in the UK and most of its operations are in the US. The news comes three-and-a-half years after US firm AbbVie abandoned its agreed $54bn (\u00a334bn) takeover of Shire, after a US clampdown on so-called tax inversions by American companies buying an overseas business to secure a lower tax rate. Shire then turned acquirer and completed a $32bn purchase of US firm Baxalta last June. In November it reported a drop in sales of haemophilia drugs, which had become its biggest source of revenue following the deal. Takeda said it was \u201cat a preliminary and exploratory stage\u201d in considering a bid, and no approach had been made to the Shire board. Shire confirmed that it had not received an approach from Takeda. In accordance with City takeover rules, the Japanese drugmaker will have to announce a firm intention to make an offer by 5pm on 25 April or walk away. Takeda said a deal would strengthen its presence in its core areas of oncology, gastrointestinal and neuroscience drugs, as well as boosting its position in specialised medicines by adding Shire\u2019s rare disease portfolio. The acquisition would also help Takeda expand its presence in the US. Ketan Patel, co-manager of the Amity UK Fund at EdenTree Investment Management, said a deal would be a \u201cwatershed moment for Japanese pharma\u201d. \u201cTakeda\u2019s cash laden balance sheet appears a good fit for Shire\u2019s struggling balance sheet, following recent large scale M&amp;A,\u201d he said. \u201cThe attraction for Takeda is the highly lucrative rare disease market in the US, which comes with exceedingly high margins and is largely exempt from the usual pricing pressure that affects the wider pharmaceutical sector.\u201d There are more than 7,000 known rare diseases, including haemophilia, Hunter syndrome, and many forms of rare cancer, and an estimated 350 million people worldwide are living with one. Shares in Shire have been weak in the past year after the company said profits would be held back by greater competition from generic drugs and lower royalties. It plans to split its business in two, dividing the rare disease and hyperactivity medicines businesses to boost performance. The Baxalta acquisition, by far its largest deal, gave Shire three new areas of research \u2013 haematology, immunology and oncology \u2013 and more than tripled the number of its employees to 23,000. Founded as an herbal medicine shop in Osaka more than 200 years ago, Takeda has grown into a company that employs 30,000 people in more than 70 countries. Analysts at Jefferies saw the strategic rationale for the deal: \u201cShire\u2019s leading global position in rare diseases would likely be attractive for most large pharma/biotech.\u201d However, they noted: \u201cTakeda\u2019s $42bn market cap vs Shire\u2019s $47bn raises questions on a potential deal structure.\u201d Jack Scannell, the co-head of pharmaceutical research at UBS, said a merger of equals would make more sense. \u201cThere is presumably a price at which the financial engineering would work. Shire\u2019s specialty focus and mix of therapeutic areas means that most buyers would struggle to reap substantial operational benefits,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Greg Clark is awake after all. The business secretary has declared \u2013 about eight weeks after he could have acted \u2013 that it would be a fine thing if we knew more about how Melrose would manage GKN if its \u00a38bn bid succeeds. The result is five legally binding commitments from Melrose and one voluntary offer \u2013 a pledge to keep GKN\u2019s aerospace division, the most sensitive asset from the point of view of the UK\u2019s long-term industrial ambitions, at least until 2023 unless the government agrees otherwise. Everybody happy? No. The five post-offer undertakings, as they are called, are completely mundane. They read as if they were invented by Clark to create the appearance of bold action. They merely oblige Melrose to do things it would have done anyway. Keep the HQ in the UK and maintain a listing on the London stock market? Melrose has structured itself that way since it was founded in 2003. By contrast, chief executive Simon Peckham\u2019s offer to keep GKN Aerospace until April 2023 is genuinely interesting. Assuming this becomes a binding undertaking, Melrose is tying its hands for a while, which may disappoint some of its supporters. GKN\u2019s Driveline automotive division can still be sold at any time \u2013 but, since GKN itself is planning to combine that business with Dana of the US, nobody can grumble on that score. Yet the overall appearance here is of a government minister, whose brief includes \u201cindustrial policy\u201d, flapping around ineffectually at the 11th hour when presented with a bid that plainly could have long-term implications for the UK\u2019s engineering base. He is operating with limited powers, of course. Unless the bid raises national security issues (yet to be formally decided, but unlikely), there is little government can do. But it is bizarre to hear Clark worry about Melrose\u2019s \u201cshort-term approach to ownership\u201d and the \u201cbroader interests at play\u201d but be reduced, in effect, to pleading with the company to play nice. If the government wants to intervene, it should just propose a proper public interest test. Properly drafted, it would not deter foreign investment. Melrose \u2013 who knows? \u2013 might have passed formal scrutiny since it is a UK company anyway and its record on pensions, at least, is sound. The next big bid, however, could be different. A cuddly conversation between minister and bidder, resulting in choreographed letters two days before an offer closes, feels woefully amateurish. GSK\u2019s \u00a39bn Novartis deal looks like progress The stars have aligned for Emma Walmsley\u2019s first big strategic move as chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline. Last week the group quit the contest to buy Pfizer\u2019s consumer health division, a deal that could have cost $20bn (\u00a314bn) and was unnerving her own shareholders. Now GSK gets full control of a business it knows well \u2013 its own Panadol to Sensodyne consumer business, 63.5% owned \u2013 at a price that won\u2019t shock anybody. Swiss group Novartis\u2019 ability to force its 36.5% interest onto GSK at any point from this month to 2035 has been a major uncertainty ever since the combination was agreed in 2015 as part of a wider deal. Having a potential \u00a38.6bn liability on the books can cramp your style and complicate financing. In the event, GSK is paying \u00a39.2bn for the minority stake, a price that certainly isn\u2019t cheap but looks OK if profit margins can be boosted to \u201cmid-20s\u201d percentages by 2022 from the current 17.7%. Horlicks, which is only really big in India these days, and a few other brands may be sold to raise a couple of billion and reduce the strain on the balance sheet. Overall, though, the deal should boost GSK\u2019s cash flows and thus offer modest extra protection for the 80p-a-share dividend, investors\u2019 number one obsession. In the long run, Walmsley\u2019s reinvigoration of GSK hangs on the output from the pharmaceutical labs. But the tidying-up of the consumer side is progress. Green escapes ban \u2013 but we should see the report The Insolvency Service could have taken the view that Sir Philip Green\u2019s sale of BHS for \u00a31 to a plainly unsuitable buyer, the thrice-bankrupt Dominic Chappell, was an act of such extreme irresponsibility that only a disqualification as a company direct would suffice. Green\u2019s attempt to make amends with BHS pensioners, by making a \u00a3363m payment, could have been deemed beside the point. Selling to Chappell\u2019s underfunded consortium was crass, stupid and wrong. Green has emerged without sanction, however. A fair decision? Well, one can guess at the reasoning. Green\u2019s pensions deal was agreed with the Pensions Regulator, which was the official thumbs-up that MPs effectively demanded.
