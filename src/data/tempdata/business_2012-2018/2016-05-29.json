      "bodyText": "The Queen has famously served it to Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, and it will now be the official drink of Downing Street receptions. As English sparkling wines gain increasing acclaim at home and abroad \u2013 picking up a number of international awards \u2013 growing numbers of people are setting up as smaller scale producers in the chalky soils of Hampshire, Sussex and Kent. Last year 37 new winemakers started in business in England, according to accountants UHY Hacker Young. Over the past five years 170 new producers have been licensed by HM Revenue &amp; Customs. Among the so called \u201cvineyard virgins\u201d are former insurance boss Douglas Jacobsohn and his wife, Susanna, who bought 40 hectares (100 acres) of land outside Tonbridge in Kent in 2014. They have just planted 5 hectares to make English sparkling wine called Blackdon, from the three classic champagne grape varieties \u2013 chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier \u2013 and hope to fill the first bottles in 2018. Jacobsohn, 62, who stepped down as chief executive of marine insurer Skuld, a Lloyd\u2019s of London syndicate, in February last year, said: \u201cWe are both Swedish and originally looked at agricultural premises when we moved here for my job at Lloyd\u2019s five years ago. After a while this opportunity came up.\u201d Perhaps bearing in mind the old adage \u2013 \u201cHow do you make a small fortune from wine? Start with a larger one\u201d \u2013 the Jacobsohns are taking a cautious approach. \u201cWe want to figure out the quality of it before we decide to go further [and plant more],\u201d he said. In terms of quality they have much to live up to. Ridgeview from Sussex and Chapel Down from Kent were last week named official suppliers for Downing Street receptions. It was Ridgeview\u2019s Grosvenor 2009 brut that was served as an aperitif for the state dinner for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, hosted by the Queen last October. The Jacobsohns plan to sell locally at first, from the farm shop and via the internet, but also want to export to their native Sweden. \u201cThe Swedish and Danes are very interested in wine,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the TV coverage, there have been some reports about English wines winning international awards. English sparkling wine goes very well with Swedish seafood.\u201d He described Blackdon as a medium-sized vineyard with the capacity to make 25,000 to 30,000 bottles a year. There are many others that are smaller \u2013 around 500 vineyards in total in England and Wales covering aabout 1,800 hectares and producing sparkling and still wines, according to English Wine Producers, the official website for the industry. Many of them are family businesses which, mirroring the craft beer revolution, are tapping into the growing popularity of boutique and local produce. In large parts of southern England the climate and soil are similar to that of the Champagne region. A high number of sunshine hours and south-facing slopes with free-draining soils (to protect from frost) and protection from wind are key. Such geographical features attracted French champagne house Taittinger to buy a former Kent apple orchard with 69 hectares of farmland near Chilham in December, where it will produce English sparkling wine. They may not carry the champagne label (only fizz produced in the Champagne region of France can carry the title), but English sparkling wines won 14 gold medals at the 2015 International Wine Challenge. English wines overall carried off 72 medals. One winner was former solicitor Simon Robinson, chairman of Hattingley Valley Wines in Hampshire, who started planting vines only in 2008 and had his first vintage in 2010. His sparkling Hattingley Valley Classic Cuv\u00e9e NV was awarded gold. He said: \u201cIn the mid- to late 90s it was recognised that the soil in the UK and the climate we have is particularly suitable to the production of sparkling wine. You could say why did it take so long to recognise? I don\u2019t have a real answer to that.\u201d UHY Hacker Young said the rise in new wine producers was driven by such high-quality \u201cEnglish wine\u201d \u2013 where the grapes are grown here \u2013 rather than what is considered to be the lower quality \u201cBritish wine\u201d, made from imported grapes. James Simmonds, a partner at UHY Hacker Young, said: \u201cIn recent years the wine industry has gone from strength to strength, and customers are now opting for English wines over French or Italian products, which 20 years ago would have been seen as a joke.\u201d However, winemaking is a risky business that requires a big cash outlay upfront with no prospect of returns for several years as the vines mature. Charles Simpson, another English wine producer, said: \u201cWine businesses are known for being notoriously difficult to fund.\u201d Growers also face the fact that grape yields are low in England, typically 5-6 tonnes a hectare, compared with 10 tonnes in France. Simpson and his wife, Ruth, \u201cgave up the rat race\u201d in 2002 and bought a 46-hectare estate and ch\u00e2teau in Languedoc. He had been commercial development director at the pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline; she worked for the National Lottery. They had no experience of winemaking, but are now producing 400,000 bottles of sparkling wine a year at Domaine de Sainte Rose, near B\u00e9ziers. Their wines are stocked by Waitrose, Majestic and Naked Wines, priced at between \u00a322 and \u00a345 a bottle. The Simpsons are also applying their newfound expertise to the 30 hectares they acquired in Barham, Kent, two years ago, a third of which has been planted with vines. This year they will have their first harvest in the county, in late September or early October, following their Languedoc harvest in late July. \u201cYou get the first harvest from the third leaf [vine-growing season],\u201d he said. English wine producers have been starting from scratch, whereas the big French houses are being handed down from generation to generation and have been investing in equipment and perfecting their winemaking methods for over 200 years. This means English wines tend to be more expensive than French rivals. However, producers believe British consumers are willing to pay more for an artisanal homegrown product. Jacobsohn said: \u201cThere is a trend to be patriotic if you are into wine drinking. It seems to me that people prepared to pay a little bit extra if the quality holds up.\u201d The UK environment secretary, Elizabeth Truss, recently held the first wine roundtable with industry representatives and announced ambitious targets, such as a tenfold increase in exports from 250,000 bottles to 2.5m bottles by 2020. By value, this would mean an increase from \u00a33.2m to more than \u00a330m. Only a small quantity, less than 5%, is exported at the moment, primarily to Scandinavia and English-speaking countries such as the US, Canada and Ireland, according to Stephen Skelton, a veteran winemaker. After studying winemaking in Germany in the mid-1970s, he returned to the UK to establish the vineyards at Tenterden in Kent, now the home of Chapel Down Wines, one of the UK\u2019s biggest producers. The government is trying to help would-be producers by releasing new data on soil types, water resources and infrastructure networks to identify the best areas for growing vines. Said Simpson: \u201cSite selection is the single most important thing. If you choose the wrong site, you will be pushing water up the hill for years. Some people have done that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tata Steel must give guarantees it would be committed to the British steel industry for the long haul if it abandons the planned sale of its UK business, the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock has said. Last week it emerged the Indian company was considering keeping its UK steelmaking arm after putting the loss-making business up for sale in March. The development raised further hopes the Port Talbot plant in Kinnock\u2019s Aberavon constituency in south Wales and 11,000 jobs across the country can be saved. Sources close to Tata Steel said its owners were assessing the performance of the UK operation and the package of financial support made available by the government. At the same time it was continuing to run the sales process and has reportedly whittled down a field of seven bidders to a four-strong shortlist. But amid hopes of a U-turn on the planned sale, Kinnock said steelworkers would treat the news with scepticism and anger. He told BBC Radio Wales\u2019s Sunday Supplement programme: \u201cIf that is the case, fine. If they do want to stay we would welcome that in principle. \u201cBut I would also say in practice steelworkers in my constituency, their families and communities around them have been through hell in the last few years and certainly since March when the sale was announced.\u201d Her added: \u201cI think they\u2019ll be forgiven for treating any news that Tata is staying on board with a degree of scepticism and even anger. So I think we need a very clear set of guarantees from Tata that they will be in it for the long run, that there will be investment and they will be doing what\u2019s needed so we\u2019re not back at square one 12 months from now.\u201d European steelmakers are under huge pressure from cheap Chinese exports, which have sent global steel prices plunging. But Tata\u2019s financial position has improved. On Wednesday, it group net losses of 32.1bn rupees (\u00a3325m) in the three months to 31 March, down from 56.7bn rupees in same quarter last year. Tata is nevertheless expected to complete the sale of its European long products division, which employs 4,800 people, to Greybull Capital for a token \u00a31 this week. About 4,400 workers are in the UK, mostly in Scunthorpe, with another 400 in France. A sign bearing the words British Steel \u2013 the new name for the business harking back to its former incarnation as a publicly owned industrial giant \u2013 is expected to be unveiled at the Scunthorpe plant on Wednesday, when it is handed over to its new owner, a little known investment family office.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Property investors provided Dominic Chappell with the \u00a335m needed to show Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group that he was a credible buyer for BHS, it has emerged. Allied Commercial Exporters (ACE) then went on to make millions from a series of real estate deals with the department store chain. ACE, which is run by Guy and Alexander Dellal, the son and grandson of property investor \u201cBlack Jack\u201d Dellal, backed Chappell\u2019s takeover with the consortium Retail Acquisitions before buying an office block from BHS and loaning the retailer money at such a fierce interest rate that it was known by management as the \u201cWonga\u201d loan. Arcadia executives told MPs investigating the collapse of BHS that the \u00a335m payment was vital in determining the credibility of Retail Acquisitions, the consortium led by Chappell, before it bought BHS in March 2015. Paul Budge, Arcadia\u2019s finance director, said: \u201cWe actually asked them to make sure that they deposit \u00a335m with Olswang [Retail Acquisitions\u2019 lawyers] in the Olswang client account to confirm their intentions. If we were going to go forward, sign up some heads of terms and give them a period of exclusivity, they had to do that. So they put \u00a335m into an escrow.\u201d Mishcon de Reya, the legal firm acting for ACE, confirmed the payment had been made by ACE. It said: \u201cIn February 2015 an amount of \u00a335m was transferred by Mishcon de Reya on behalf of ACE to the client account of Olswang against an Olswang solicitors\u2019 undertaking to repay on demand.\u201d Sources close to Arcadia said the group was unaware that ACE had made the payment on behalf of Retail Acquisitions at the time, but subsequently became aware of their involvement. \u201cBlack Jack\u201d Dellal helped to finance Green\u2019s takeover of retail group Sears in 1998. However, sources close to the deal said Chappell was an associate of Alexander Dellal and that was how the agreement came about. \u201c[Arcadia] didn\u2019t know he knew him,\u201d a source said. Following the \u00a335m payment, on the day that Retail Acquisitions bought BHS from Arcadia for \u00a31, ACE bought North West House, a BHS office building next to its headquarters in north London. ACE acquired the building from BHS for about \u00a333m. Two months later ACE sold the building for \u00a338m. ACE also lent \u00a35m to Retail Acquisitions in March, which was paid back when BHS sold its warehouse in the Midlands in August, and loaned \u00a325m to BHS, which cost the retailer \u00a36m in interest and fees in just three months. The profits from the sale of North West House and the charges on the loans mean that ACE collected more than \u00a310m from its dealings with Chappell and BHS. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by ACE. The company has said the various agreements were not connected and at commercial rates. The fact that ACE backed the deal raises further questions about whether Chappell had the financial strength to take control of BHS. Chappell has been declared bankrupt three times and had little experience of the retail industry. The Guardian revealed on Friday that a \u00a35m \u201cbonanza\u201d cited by Chappell to bolster his business credentials when buying BHS was an accounting estimate and not the cash payment he had previously claimed. Chappell had presented the windfall in the accounts of Olivia Investments, his family\u2019s holding company in Gibraltar, to counter concerns that the former bankrupt had little relevant experience when acquiring the retailer in 2015. BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit valued at about \u00a3571m. The retailer has been saddled with the deficit despite Green and other investors collecting more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership. The retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Chappell. Retail Acquisitions received payments of more than \u00a325m from BHS during its 13-month ownership of the retailer. Administrator Duff &amp; Phelps is in talks with a Portuguese-backed consortium about a rescue deal for BHS. The consortium is being led Greg Tufnell, the former managing director of Mothercare and Burton, and the brother of former England cricketer Phil Tufnell. An announcement about a rescue deal is likely on either Wednesday or Thursday. Chappell did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For some it is the sound of the first cuckoo. For others it is the chock of leather on willow. But for those who write about the economy the first sign of spring is when colleagues start asking for advice on when to buy their foreign currency for a holiday abroad. This year, inevitably, the decision has been made more difficult by the EU referendum on 23 June. Is it better to buy euros or dollars now or wait to see which way the vote goes? Admit it, lots of you have been weighing up the risks in the past few weeks, haven\u2019t you? Well, here are a few of the factors to take into consideration. If the vote is for Brexit, those who have held on before buying their foreign currency will be kicking themselves, because there will be a sharp fall in sterling that is almost certain to persist for the rest of the summer \u2013 and perhaps beyond. Opinion polls suggest the remain side is on course to win, and financial markets react badly to surprises. There would be a lot of political and economic uncertainty. There would be doubts about whether David Cameron could survive as prime minister. There would be speculation that the result could pave the way for Jeremy Corbyn to become prime minister. It would take time to establish what sort of relationship Britain could negotiate with the other 27 members of the European Union. Of course, the entire government machine would do a rapid volte face on 24 June in an attempt to reassure the markets that the consequences of Brexit would be minor and manageable. There would be no more lurid warnings about impending recessions; instead the Treasury and the Bank of England would come up with an action plan in double quick time. Even so, the experience of the UK\u2019s departure from the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 would suggest a hefty decline in the pound. The fall would probably be bigger against the dollar than against the euro, because the collateral damage from Brexit would be greater for the EU than for the US. A fall in the value of the pound makes exports cheaper and imports dearer. It means people coming into the UK get more pounds for their foreign currency while those leaving the UK get less foreign currency for their pounds. Brexit would be good news for the UK tourism industry, less good news for the short-haul airlines and package holiday companies. Another possible scenario is that the battle between the two sides remains close over the next three weeks but that, as in Scotland in 2014, the referendum ends with a narrow victory for those arguing for the status quo. If a couple of rogue polls had previously suggested that the Leave side was on course to win, there would then be what markets call a relief rally. Sterling would rise on the foreign exchanges because there would be no need for the prime minister to fall on his sword and the civil service would not have to spend the next couple of years renegotiating access to the European single market. In these circumstances, though, it might be advisable for those wanting the best foreign currency deal to move swiftly. Relief rallies don\u2019t tend to last very long, and there are good reasons for thinking that would be the case after a narrow win for remain. For a start, Cameron\u2019s position would still be precarious, with the threat of a leadership challenge from Brexiters in his own party who would say that remain had won by underhand means. Financial markets would quickly get the idea that 23 June had not actually resolved Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU and thus start to speculate about the possibility of another referendum. The relief rally might last longer against the euro than against the US dollar. That\u2019s because the threat of Brexit has been one of the factors that has been deterring America\u2019s central bank, the federal reserve, from raising interest rates. The prospect of higher UK interest rates might also be brought forward in the event of a vote to remain, but the Bank of England is likely to be more cautious than the Fed. British households are more indebted than their US counterparts and less likely to have borrowed at long-term fixed rates. That makes them more exposed to higher borrowing costs. As a result, the gap between US and UK interest rates is likely to widen, and that would tend to push up the value of the dollar against the pound. The final scenario involves a convincing win for the remain camp. In this outcome, those who currently say they don\u2019t know how they are going to vote have actually decided that Brexit is too risky and that will ensure that the margin of victory is big, perhaps of the order of 60%-40%. If that\u2019s the case, wouldn\u2019t it be better to hang on until after 23 June? Well, perhaps. A convincing remain win would certainly shore up Cameron\u2019s position and would put the idea of a second referendum to bed. The pound\u2019s rally would be stronger and would go on for longer. Hanging on, though, is still something of a gamble. For a start, much will depend on what happens in the polls over the coming weeks. If it looks as if the remain side will win convincingly, the rally in the pound will take place before the referendum not afterwards. In the jargon of the markets, defeat for Brexit will already be in the price. The post-referendum upside would then be limited, and markets would move on to something else. That \u201csomething else\u201d might well be the poor underlying state of the UK economy, which has a twin deficit (budget and current account) problem, high and rising levels of debt, low levels of saving, sluggish productivity growth, and poor infrastructure. These structural weaknesses were there before the Brexit debate began and they will be there whichever side triumphs in a few weeks\u2019 time. When the Bank of England reported on the state of the economy in its quarterly inflation report earlier this month, it noted that only half the fall in the pound since November had been the result of Brexit concerns. The other half reflects unease about the fact that the economy is both slowing and grotesquely unbalanced. These concerns have largely been buried since the referendum was called, but will resurface whether or not Britain remains in the EU. Sterling has been remarkably steady on the foreign exchanges, but will need to fall in order to increase exports and dampen consumption. For this year\u2019s holidaymakers to Spain, Italy, France and the US, the question to consider is how long it will take the financial markets to start selling the pound. Even with a remain vote, it might not take long.",

There would be a lot of political and economic uncertainty. There would be doubts about whether David Cameron could survive as prime minister. There would be speculation that the result could pave the way for Jeremy Corbyn to become prime minister. It would take time to establish what sort of relationship Britain could negotiate with the other 27 members of the European Union.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/16/foreign-currency-top-tips-buying-holiday-money\">Foreign currency: top tips for buying your holiday money</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, the entire government machine would do a rapid volte face on 24 June in an attempt to reassure the markets that the consequences of Brexit would be minor and manageable. There would be no more lurid warnings about impending recessions; instead the Treasury and the Bank of England would come up with an action plan in double quick time.</p> <p>Even so, the experience of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-bad-day-conservatives\">UK\u2019s departure from the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992</a> would suggest a hefty decline in the pound. The fall would probably be bigger against the dollar than against the euro, because the collateral damage from Brexit would be greater for the EU than for the US.</p> <p>A fall in the value of the pound makes exports cheaper and imports dearer. It means people coming into the UK get more pounds for their foreign currency while those leaving the UK get less foreign currency for their pounds. Brexit would be good news for the UK tourism industry, less good news for the short-haul airlines and package holiday companies.</p> <p>Another possible scenario is that the battle between the two sides remains close over the next three weeks but that, as in Scotland in 2014, the referendum ends with a narrow victory for those arguing for the status quo. If a couple of rogue polls had previously suggested that the Leave side was on course to win, there would then be what markets call a relief rally. Sterling would rise on the foreign exchanges because there would be no need for the prime minister to fall on his sword and the civil service would not have to spend the next couple of years renegotiating access to the European single market.</p> <p>In these circumstances, though, it might be advisable for those wanting the best foreign currency deal to move swiftly. Relief rallies don\u2019t tend to last very long, and there are good reasons for thinking that would be the case after a narrow win for remain. For a start, Cameron\u2019s position would still be precarious, with the threat of a leadership challenge from Brexiters in his own party who would say that remain had won by underhand means.</p> <p>Financial markets would quickly get the idea that 23 June had not actually resolved Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU and thus start to speculate about the possibility of another referendum.</p> <p>The relief rally might last longer against the euro than against the US dollar. That\u2019s because the threat of Brexit has been one of the factors that has been deterring America\u2019s central bank, the federal reserve, from raising interest rates.</p> <p>The prospect of higher UK interest rates might also be brought forward in the event of a vote to remain, but the Bank of England is likely to be more cautious than the Fed. British households are more indebted than their US counterparts and less likely to have borrowed at long-term fixed rates. That makes them more exposed to higher borrowing costs. As a result, the gap between US and UK interest rates is likely to widen, and that would tend to push up the value of the dollar against the pound.</p> <p>The final scenario involves a convincing win for the remain camp. In this outcome, those who currently say they don\u2019t know how they are going to vote have actually decided that Brexit is too risky and that will ensure that the margin of victory is big, perhaps of the order of 60%-40%. If that\u2019s the case, wouldn\u2019t it be better to hang on until after 23 June?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/may/12/the-smartphone-app-revolutionising-foreign-currency-exchange\">The smartphone app revolutionising foreign currency exchange</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Well, perhaps. A convincing remain win would certainly shore up Cameron\u2019s position and would put the idea of a second referendum to bed. The pound\u2019s rally would be stronger and would go on for longer.</p> <p>Hanging on, though, is still something of a gamble. For a start, much will depend on what happens in the polls over the coming weeks. If it looks as if the remain side will win convincingly, the rally in the pound will take place before the referendum not afterwards. In the jargon of the markets, defeat for Brexit will already be in the price. The post-referendum upside would then be limited, and markets would move on to something else.</p> <p>That \u201csomething else\u201d might well be the poor underlying state of the UK economy, which has a twin deficit (budget and current account) problem, high and rising levels of debt, low levels of saving, sluggish productivity growth, and poor infrastructure.</p> <p>These structural weaknesses were there before the Brexit debate began and they will be there whichever side triumphs in a few weeks\u2019 time. When the Bank of England reported on the state of the economy in its <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/inflationreport/2016/may.aspx\">quarterly inflation report </a>earlier this month, it noted that only half the fall in the pound since November had been the result of Brexit concerns. The other half reflects unease about the fact that the economy is both slowing and grotesquely unbalanced.</p> <p>These concerns have largely been buried since the referendum was called, but will resurface whether or not Britain remains in the EU. Sterling has been remarkably steady on the foreign exchanges, but will need to fall in order to increase exports and dampen consumption. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>For this year\u2019s holidaymakers to Spain, Italy, France and the US, the question to consider is how long it will take the financial markets to start selling the pound. Even with a remain vote, it might not take long.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

      "bodyText": "Have you heard about the terrific bat houses and hedgehog tunnels down at Hinkley Point in Somerset? Energy minister Andrea Leadsom has been to inspect them herself and raved about them last week to a select committee of MPs. They were evidence, she suggested, of the depth of commitment of French firm EDF to the \u00a318bn nuclear power station due to be built on the site. Well, maybe. Talk of bats and hedgehogs at least provided some relief from the familiar crop of Hinkley news. French economy minister Emmanuel Macron said he was \u201cfully behind\u201d the project but EDF\u2019s unions confirmed that they weren\u2019t. Jean-Luc Magnaval, secretary of EDF\u2019s workers\u2019 committee, told the BBC that the unions \u201chave reservations about several aspects of the project: organisation, supply chain, installation and procurement\u201d. That\u2019s a long list. Meanwhile, EDF Energy chief executive Vincent de Rivaz, appearing before the same committee as Leadsom, had to adopt a humbler tone than on his last outing two months ago. Then he had promised a final investment decision \u201cvery soon\u201d; this time he wouldn\u2019t speculate about a date. This farce \u2013 which has been running since last October, when the final sign-off was due within weeks \u2013 could yet roll on and on. The UK government is disinclined to set a deadline: it\u2019s a \u201ccommercial decision\u201d for EDF. Meanwhile, the current French government could have a radically different shape this time next year \u2013 there is a presidential election in 2017 and the incumbent, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is the least popular leader in modern French history. French union opposition to Hinkley Point appears entrenched and the workers\u2019 representatives have six seats on an 18-strong board. In theory, management and government can proceed regardless; but to embark on an \u00a318bn venture with a divided boardroom would invite trouble down the line. That is especially so when you remember EDF\u2019s last finance director, Thomas Piquemal, resigned over concerns that Hinkley could threaten the company\u2019s future. The best thing the UK government could do at this point is to stop and consider whether the obstacles facing Hinkley are simply too big. Nervousness in France is understandable. EDF\u2019s two current attempts to built a European pressurised reactor \u2013 the model to be used at Hinkley \u2013 are agonising; one is four years late, the other nine years. And the financial arithmetic was always challenging. Hinkley could take 10 years to build, and the owners receive nothing during the construction phase; the cash only arrives when electricity starts to be generated. And, while the returns on capital under the 35-year contract are theoretically enormous, the penalties for failure to hit a 2029 deadline are stinging, and ratchet up. That is why the UK government had to make the 35-year contract so generous \u2013 struck at almost three times today\u2019s wholesale price. That contract now looks to belong to another era given the subsequent fall in the oil price, and thus energy costs. The only weak support holding Hinkley in place is its capacity to provide 7% of the UK\u2019s electricity in a low-carbon fashion. But there are other ways to meet the legally binding emissions targets. Offshore wind is expanding with no Hinkley-style fuss, and its costs are falling. More importantly for the UK\u2019s requirement for secure baseload supplies, other builders are waiting to pursue projects that use different nuclear technology. In theory, planning and appraisal can continue in parallel; in practice, confidence in the UK\u2019s commitment to its new-nuclear programme will drain away. There is not \u2013 yet \u2013 a crisis in UK energy policy because it is always possible to build a few gas-fired stations to avert an emergency. But the Hinkley show is becoming an embarrassment. The project is expensive, uses unproven technology and its builder is a disunited and over-borrowed company that requires constant financial assurances from an ever-changing cast of politicians. The UK government should set EDF a deadline and be ready to enforce it. We can do better \u2013 much better \u2013 than Hinkley. Banking guru says Bank is too soft on banks When the architect of banking reform in the UK accuses the Bank of England of going soft on the sector, it is time to sit up and take notice. Sir John Vickers, who led the coalition government\u2019s Independent Commission on Banking (ICB), made the assertion again last week when Threadneedle Street issued new guidelines on capital which concluded that the system (largely) had amassed enough capital. While no one appears to doubt that the banking system is stronger than it was before the 2008 crisis \u2013 the amount of capital held by banks globally has doubled since 2007 \u2013 Vickers believes that the Bank should be asking banks to hold even more. While the argument about systemic risk buffers is not easy to digest, it is worth taking a moment to think about it. Vickers argues that the Bank is being too lenient in adopting one of the ICB\u2019s recommendations \u2013 about putting 3% of capital aside as a systemic risk buffer (think of it as a bit of extra insurance in case things go bad). The Bank says the buffer can be on a rising scale, depending on the size of the bank. On its current assessment no UK bank would need to hit the 3% level. It might be easy to decide that Vickers \u2013 now warden at All Soul\u2019s College, Oxford \u2013 is making the point to protect his legacy. Indeed one of his fellow commission members \u2013 former Barclays boss Martin Taylor \u2013 last week insisted that the differences in capital requirements between the ICB and the Bank of England were \u201cmore or less invisible to the naked eye\u201d. Taylor, it should be noted, is now a policymaker at the Bank. So, too, is chief economist Andy Haldane who, in seeming contrast, has welcomed what he describes as the \u201cacademic challenge\u201d of prudential regulation. While easily dismissed as a topic for anoraks, this issue is simply too important to ignore. Just as well that Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, has decided to step in to referee. In April, Tyrie announced an inquiry into the matter. He should get on with it. M&amp;S needs to put clothes ahead of shareholders Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s share price is 13% lower than it was last weekend and its new chief executive finds his ambition to \u201ccherish Mrs M&amp;S\u201d derided as patronising waffle. Welcome to retailing\u2019s top table, Steve Rowe: now you know how deep the national obsession with M&amp;S goes. You\u2019re under the microscope. Rowe shouldn\u2019t worry about the share price. His grand strategic plan is to sell clothes his customers actually want to wear, and at keener prices. Easier said than done, of course, but it\u2019s the right priority. M&amp;S\u2019s share price has been sustained for too long by the thin vapours of ever-rising profit margins. Now the website actually works, it\u2019s time to address the loss of market share over many years, and never mind the immediate hit to profits. Shareholders will just have to be patient. But bin the \u201cMrs M&amp;S\u201d lines. The 1970s language is one problem. The bigger drawback is that no one wants to be viewed as a caricature.",

French economy minister Emmanuel Macron said he was \u201cfully behind\u201d the project but EDF\u2019s unions confirmed that they weren\u2019t. Jean-Luc Magnaval, secretary of EDF\u2019s workers\u2019 committee, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36394601\" title=\"\">told the BBC</a> that the unions \u201chave reservations about several aspects of the project: organisation, supply chain, installation and procurement\u201d. That\u2019s a long list.</p> <p>Meanwhile, EDF Energy chief executive Vincent de Rivaz, appearing before the same committee as Leadsom, had to adopt a humbler tone than on his last outing two months ago. Then he had promised a final investment decision \u201cvery soon\u201d; this time he wouldn\u2019t speculate about a date.</p> <p>This farce \u2013 which has been running since last October, when the final sign-off was due within weeks \u2013 could yet roll on and on. The UK government is disinclined to set a deadline: it\u2019s a \u201ccommercial decision\u201d for EDF.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the current French government could have a radically different shape this time next year \u2013 there is a presidential election in 2017 and the incumbent, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is the least popular leader in modern French history. French union opposition to Hinkley Point appears entrenched and the workers\u2019 representatives have six seats on an 18-strong board.</p> <p>In theory, management and government can proceed regardless; but to embark on an \u00a318bn venture with a divided boardroom would invite trouble down the line. That is especially so when you remember EDF\u2019s last finance director, Thomas Piquemal, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/07/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-project-in-crisis-as-edf-finance-director-resigns\" title=\"\">resigned over concerns</a> that Hinkley could threaten the company\u2019s future.</p> <p>The best thing the UK government could do at this point is to stop and consider whether the obstacles facing Hinkley are simply too big. Nervousness in France is understandable. EDF\u2019s two current attempts to built a European pressurised reactor \u2013 the model to be used at Hinkley \u2013 are agonising; one is four years late, the other nine years. And the financial arithmetic was always challenging. Hinkley could take 10 years to build, and the owners receive nothing during the construction phase; the cash only arrives when electricity starts to be generated. And, while the returns on capital under the 35-year contract are theoretically enormous, the penalties for failure to hit a 2029 deadline are stinging, and ratchet up.</p> <p>That is why the UK government had to make the 35-year contract so generous \u2013 struck at almost three times today\u2019s wholesale price. That contract now looks to belong to another era given the subsequent fall in the oil price, and thus energy costs. The only weak support holding Hinkley in place is its capacity to provide 7% of the UK\u2019s electricity in a low-carbon fashion.</p> <p>But there are other ways to meet the legally binding emissions targets. Offshore wind is expanding with no Hinkley-style fuss, and its costs are falling. More importantly for the UK\u2019s requirement for secure baseload supplies, other builders are waiting to pursue projects that use different nuclear technology. In theory, planning and appraisal can continue in parallel; in practice, confidence in the UK\u2019s commitment to its new-nuclear programme will drain away.</p> <p>There is not \u2013 yet \u2013 a crisis in UK energy policy because it is always possible to build a few gas-fired stations to avert an emergency. But the Hinkley show is becoming an embarrassment. The project is expensive, uses unproven technology and its builder is a disunited and over-borrowed company that requires constant financial assurances from an ever-changing cast of politicians. The UK government should set EDF a deadline and be ready to enforce it. We can do better \u2013 much better \u2013 than Hinkley.</p> <h2>Banking guru says Bank is too soft on banks</h2> <p>When the architect of banking reform in the UK<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/26/bank-of-england-rejects-claim-watered-down-ringfencing-plans\" title=\"\"> accuses the Bank of England of going soft</a> on the sector, it is time to sit up and take notice. Sir John Vickers, who led the coalition government\u2019s Independent Commission on Banking (ICB), made the assertion again last week when Threadneedle Street issued new guidelines on capital which concluded that the system (largely) had amassed enough capital.</p> <p>While no one appears to doubt that the banking system is stronger than it was before the 2008 crisis \u2013 the amount of capital held by banks globally has doubled since 2007 \u2013 Vickers believes that the Bank should be asking banks to hold even more.</p> <p>While the argument about systemic risk buffers is not easy to digest, it is worth taking a moment to think about it. Vickers argues that the Bank is being too lenient in adopting one of the ICB\u2019s recommendations \u2013 about putting 3% of capital aside as a systemic risk buffer (think of it as a bit of extra insurance in case things go bad). The Bank says the buffer can be on a rising scale, depending on the size of the bank. On its current assessment no UK bank would need to hit the 3% level.</p> <p>It might be easy to decide that Vickers \u2013 now warden at All Soul\u2019s College, Oxford \u2013 is making the point to protect his legacy. Indeed one of his fellow commission members \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech910.pdf\" title=\"\">former Barclays boss Martin Taylor</a> \u2013 last week insisted that the differences in capital requirements between the ICB and the Bank of England were \u201cmore or less invisible to the naked eye\u201d.</p> <p>Taylor, it should be noted, is now a policymaker at the Bank. So, too, is chief economist Andy Haldane who, in seeming contrast, has welcomed what he describes as the \u201cacademic challenge\u201d of prudential regulation.</p> <p>While easily dismissed as a topic for anoraks, this issue is simply too important to ignore. Just as well that Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, has decided to step in to referee. In April, Tyrie announced an inquiry into the matter. He should get on with it.</p> <h2>M&amp;S needs to put clothes ahead of shareholders</h2> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s share price is 13% lower than it was last weekend and its new chief executive finds his ambition to \u201ccherish Mrs M&amp;S\u201d derided as patronising waffle. Welcome to retailing\u2019s top table, Steve Rowe: now you know how deep the national obsession with M&amp;S goes. You\u2019re under the microscope.</p> <p>Rowe shouldn\u2019t worry about the share price. His grand strategic plan is to sell clothes his customers actually want to wear, and at keener prices. Easier said than done, of course, but it\u2019s the right priority. M&amp;S\u2019s share price has been sustained for too long by the thin vapours of ever-rising profit margins. Now the website actually works, it\u2019s time to address the loss of market share over many years, and never mind the immediate hit to profits. Shareholders will just have to be patient.</p> <p>But bin the \u201cMrs M&amp;S\u201d lines. The 1970s language is one problem. The bigger drawback is that no one wants to be viewed as a caricature.</p>",

Yes: in or out, we shall still belong to the continent of Europe. Moreover, given that the rest of the world also seems to be taking an interest, the outcome of the 23 June referendum can hardly be invested with too much importance. Apart from anything else, a Brexit vote would almost certainly add to the growing dissatisfaction with the EU in many continental countries. There are even fears of a domino effect. Regular readers will be aware that, while always being opposed to suggestions that we should ever put the pound into the eurozone, I am a passionate believer in the importance of our remaining within an EU that successive predecessors of David Cameron spent decades trying to join, and which, for all its faults, is better than the alternative. For some time I have been extremely nervous about the outcome. I keep meeting the most surprising people who say they intend to vote Leave. It is also worrying that for cynically political reasons the Conservatives, under the coalition, made it more difficult for 18-year-olds to register to vote. Given that the young are much more strongly European than many of their elders, David Cameron and the Cabinet Office are now desperately encouraging them to register, an act which the prime minister, no doubt himself a master of new technology, promises can be carried out in three minutes on the government website. The worry is that the older, generally pro-Brexit people will turn out in force. Which brings us to an interesting point made at London University last week by that doyen of pollsters, Sir Robert Worcester, at a symposium entitled Brexit \u2013 Then and Now, organised by the Institute of Commonwealth Studies. The \u201cthen\u201d was the June 1975 referendum, held shortly after we joined what was then the European Community in 1973. Worcester pointed out that from January 1975 until June the polls consistently showed that the probable outcome would be what we now refer to as Remain: by the impressive margin of two thirds to one third. Those polls were as good as spot-on when the day came. By contrast the polls have been much closer in recent months \u2013 indeed, from the Remain camp\u2019s point of view, perilously close until the last week or so, when there appears to have been a shift towards staying in, even among older voters. The betting market is interesting, but not entirely reassuring. William Hill tells me that the odds are now 6-1 on for our voting to remain in the EU. So Remain is apparently a racing certainty: so much so that the big gamblers are prepared to put down \u00a360 in order to win \u00a310 \u2013 something, I have to say (after a salutary experience at Ascot many years ago) I myself would never risk. On the other hand, far more individual bets are being placed on a Brexit outcome. Thus, although almost four fifths of the money has been put on Remain, two thirds of the individual, and obviously much smaller, bets have been for Brexit. One\u2019s overall impression is that while nothing can be taken for granted, the truly abysmal failure of a divided Brexit camp to present anything like a coherent case for leaving is beginning to affect marginal voters. But if there is indeed a shift of opinion in favour of Remain, things could still go awry if there is another terrorist attack and/or the subject of immigration becomes an even bigger issue. Meanwhile, it has to be said that, while historically significant, the referendum is a serious diversion from the underlying economic and political problems facing both the UK and Europe generally. The Treasury, the Bank of England and assorted international institutions and domestic thinktanks have been doing their level best to frighten the electorate with doom-laden prophecies of what lies in store if the nation votes for Brexit. But, as John Llewellyn and Russell Jones of Llewellyn Consulting remind us in their latest weekly comment: \u201cIn or out of the EU, the country is confronted by major economic challenges and the political environment is likely to remain fraught and unsettled.\u201d They point to the huge current balance of payments deficit \u2013 at 7%, much higher than the deficit that brought such problems in 1976, once the 1975 referendum was out of the way. This and problems such as the housing crisis and the lamentable structural weakness of the British economy will resurface, come what may, on 24 June. But a positive outcome is surely a necessary condition for a serious economic recovery plan. I agree with such respected commentators as Roger Bootle, Gerard Lyons and Larry Elliott that there is much wrong with economic policy in the EU (Elliott\u2019s stimulating new book with Dan Atkinson is called Europe Isn\u2019t Working) but am surprised that they all want to take the Brexit route. Who knows? A Remain vote could set a good example to other member nations where the commitment to the EU is wearing thin.",
