      "bodyText": "This year has highlighted two things \u2013 it is easier to govern when you have a lot of money to play with, and when you have a lot of money to play with you no longer worry about debt and deficit. Throughout the entire time the Liberal party was in opposition you could scarcely go a day without hearing them mention how the ALP had blown the surplus and how the Howard government had left \u201cmoney in the bank\u201d, and that now we had record levels of debt. The inability to counter the fixation on debt and deficit was perhaps one of Wayne Swan\u2019s biggest failings as treasurer. The problem was not that he acted inappropriately during the GFC by delivering large budget deficits \u2013 for that was absolutely the right thing to do in the circumstances. The problem was the fear of admitting it. And so despite employment, inflation, economic growth, inequality and any number of things being much more important than the budget deficit or surplus, we still hear the deluded narrative that a budget surplus or deficit is the key indicator of economic management. So deluded is the narrative that even those who continue to spout it don\u2019t even bother to adhere to it. For all the talk about needing to cut spending, the reality is budget surpluses are primarily driven by revenue. When you have rivers of tax revenue flowing into the government\u2019s coffers a surplus is almost unavoidable. Over the nine years the Howard government delivered a surplus (including 2007-08) government revenue was never below 24.5% of GDP. In the past 10 years it has never been above that level. Over those nine years of surpluses, government expenditure averaged 24% of GDP \u2013 only once in the past 10 years (2017-18) has revenue been above that level. After nearly a decade of blather about government surplus and paying off debt the May budget finally revealed a projected surplus in 2019-20 when government revenue will be a rather hefty 25.3% of GDP. By that time government net debt of $344bn will be more than double the $159.6bn inherited by this government. Consider as well that in that year government spending is projected to be 25% of GDP \u2013 a level that would not have delivered a surplus in any of the past 10 years. The lesson being it is much easier to boast about being good at budget management when the revenue does all the heavy lifting. And with this revenue rather coincidentally comes the lack of care about the necessity of budget surpluses and the need to pay off debt. We saw this firstly with the government\u2019s policy for a company tax cut. The big cost of the cut from big businesses was forecast to occur in years beyond the budget parameters so there was no need from the government to pretend they were offsetting the drop in revenue with spending cuts. And the drop in revenue will come. Over in the US the result of their massive company tax cuts saw company tax revenue in the first quarter of this year fall nearly 30%. The same case applied with the recently passed income tax cuts. It will cost the budget just under $8.5bn a year to abolish the 37% tax threshold and raise the top threshold to $200,000. Has the government \u2013 so worried in past years about responsible budget management \u2013 told us how this will be paid for? Of course not. The flowing rivers of revenue over the next few years hide all manner of budgetary sins \u2013 let those still around in 10 years worry about paying for it. And thus we come to the GST and the government\u2019s proposed fix. When the Productivity Commission last year recommended changes to how the GST was distributed the problem was always going to be that every state was being made worse off to improve the share that went to Western Australia. It was a political nightmare \u2013 the GST is a finite thing \u2013 slice the pie up differently and if someone gets more then someone has to get less. It is that reason why governments have struggled to come up with a solution because the option of increasing the size of the GST by broadening the tax \u2013 such as including education \u2013 has been political poison. Just throwing more money at it was not workable because that is not really a fix, but just spending your way out of a political problem \u2013 and given debt and deficit were evil any move to do that would have been met with loud criticism from a conservative opposition. Any extra money spent would mean either adding to debt or having to make cuts elsewhere. And so what did the government do? They threw money at it. In order to ensure no state is worse off under the new changes and to ensure WA gets up to the floor of 70 cents per person per dollar of GST and then 0075 cents, over the next 10 years the government will top up the GST grants to the states by the order of $9bn. Wow. If only someone before had thought before to just spend money. To be fair to the government, political realities being what they are, this was about the only way any changes to the GST carve up could be done. Politics is after all the art of the possible, and it is not possible when facing an election in the next 10 months to cut funding to key electoral states like Queensland and South Australia. And yet how did Scott Morrison sell it? He suggested that \u201cthis problem has been kicked down the road for too long and it is time we now got on and fixed it\u201d. Fixed by spending more money, with no concern or details about how such money will be offset \u2013 will the government reduce spending on schools and health and in effect force the states to devote more of their share of money to those areas? Or will it just add to debt? We don\u2019t know, and no one in the government is all that bothered with explaining. The ALP for its part is suggesting it would get WA to the 75-cent floor earlier than the 2024-25 time-line proposed by the government. So yes, we now have a bidding war. And all of this will occur while we go to the next election with the standard lines spouted about the need for budget management and living within our means. And we\u2019ll all nod and pretend that the government actually cares about such things. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "It doesn\u2019t take long for Katherine Bennett\u2019s frustration to boil over when the issue of Brexit is raised. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as Jacob Rees-Mogg thinks,\u201d said the boss of Airbus UK. \u201cWe don\u2019t just export cheese or cider to another country. \u201cWe have parts that go back and forth to different countries to be worked on \u2013 sometimes several times. That is why frictionless borders are important.\u201d Airbus has been at the centre of a political storm since it warned last month that it could quit the UK if it leaves the EU single market and customs union without a transition deal. The pan-European aerospace giant is one of Britain\u2019s biggest manufacturers, employing 14,000 people at 25 sites, including 6,000 at Broughton in north Wales. It also supports more than 100,000 jobs in the wider supply chain and spent \u00a35bn with more than 4,000 UK suppliers last year. The Broughton plant builds the wings for all Airbus planes and is seen as being most vulnerable to a hard Brexit because components could be held up at the border. Airbus\u2019s warning drew howls of protest from Brexiter politicians, who accused it of being selfish and not acting in the country\u2019s best interests. In Pegasus House, a restored art deco building at Airbus\u2019s plant in Filton, Bristol, Bennett said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure that speaking up for your business is selfish. It\u2019s just making business sense. \u201cBrexit is such a huge economic and political issue that Airbus couldn\u2019t stand on the sidelines. There was a lack of clarity on what the government was proposing.\u201d Since then, the government has thrashed out its position on Brexit, detailed in last week\u2019s white paper. The proposals offer manufacturers some comfort in a few key areas. It wants to establish a free trade area that would remove the need for customs checks and controls between the UK and the EU \u2013 as if in a combined customs territory \u2013 while enabling the UK to control tariffs for its own trade with the rest of the world. It also suggests that EU citizens could come to the UK without visas to do \u201cpaid work in limited and clearly defined circumstances\u201d. Bennett said: \u201cWe are cautiously optimistic about the Chequers agreement and white paper. It is a step in the right direction.\u201d But she added that clarity on the future trading relationship between Britain and the EU was essential for businesses to be able to plan. Derek Butler, 72, who worked at the wing production plant for more than 20 years, said it would be devastating for the area if Airbus were to close Broughton and move work elsewhere. Now a councillor with the local Flintshire authority, he said: \u201cThese things go down overnight and take generations to build back. It is absolutely a national issue.\u201d Butler, who voted Remain, believes the likes of Airbus, Jaguar Land Rover, Siemens and Nissan should have spelled out the Brexit risks to their UK businesses a lot sooner: \u201cThe big players are only now walking out to the wicket.\u201d Bennett said that because of the manufacturer\u2019s internal market, Airbus in the UK already has to compete with other locations in the group for work on future programmes: \u201cMy counterpart in Berlin tells me that he is constantly being asked by German politicians and staff, \u2018Is this an opportunity to get more work for Hamburg?\u2019 But Airbus is saying that if the work goes anywhere, it won\u2019t be in the EU; it will go to China.\u201d Since it raised its concerns about Britain quitting the EU, Airbus has been approached by at least seven governments looking to poach future wing production work. The group is currently assessing plans for its next A320 single-aisle plane. It has been courted by France, Germany and Spain, as well as the US and China \u2013 where it has assembly lines \u2013 and even Mexico and South Korea. Airbus may have an opportunity to select a new wing-assembly hub for the A320 programme. Plans for the next generation of this family of narrow-body planes call for lightweight, all-composite wings in a drive to cut fuel consumption by 30%. The group\u2019s Spanish operation has invested a lot in composite manufacturing, Bennett said, so it is \u201cquite well-placed to bid for more work\u201d. She also shot down claims from some Brexiters that Airbus would never send work to China. \u201cWe already have a final assembly line for the A320 in Tianjin, and they also do wings there,\u201d she noted. \u201cIt makes four A320s a month at the moment and that may go up. So that\u2019s one site the wing work could go to.\u201d A tour of the Filton plant reveals why it is important for Britain to retain its status as Airbus\u2019s centre of excellence for wing design and production. The wings that are eventually built at Broughton are all designed at Filton. The wings are the most complex bit of the giant aircraft jigsaw. Anthony Meisner is one of a team designing the \u201cwing of the future\u201d for Airbus planes, with the aid of a 3D software package. He dims the lights in Filton\u2019s virtual reality suite and brings up a crystal-clear 3D image of an aircraft wing on a giant screen. The image can be accessed from 25 similar suites across the group\u2019s sites, allowing design engineers and heads of manufacturing from Germany, France, Spain and the UK to view the same image and discuss any potential design flaws long before they create an issue on the assembly line. Meisner, who has worked on the project for 18 months, said: \u201cThis allows us to be around the same component, even though we are in different rooms.\u201d With a few clicks of a console he manipulates the image, pulling off panels and zooming in for a detailed look at the smallest components inside the wing, then pans out to reveal another intriguing new feature. \u201cWe\u2019re developing a folding wing tip,\u201d he said. \u201cOn a single-aisle jet like the A320, this gives a longer wing and is more aerodynamic, but it will also fit into the airport gate when folded.\u201d The current wing span for an A320 is 36 metres; Airbus is considering a span of between 40 and 44 metres for the folding wing. Mark Howard, head of research and technology business development at Airbus UK, noted that the group is introducing more automation with each aircraft programme. He also reckons the new wing will create drag improvements of 12%. \u201cSo that\u2019s pretty important because that means less fuel burn,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means that you don\u2019t need as much thrust to push it through the air, which means you can reduce engine weight. It\u2019s a snowball effect in terms of aircraft design.\u201d When the future wing goes into production \u2013 which will be within the next 10 years \u2013 Airbus will have to make a huge investment to automate large parts of the manufacturing and assembly process. These big investment decisions could be make-or-break ones for Broughton \u2013 and for Britain\u2019s place at the top table of the aerospace industry. \u201cProposals are being put on our table for investment all the time. But there is no guarantee that the next wing or product will come to us,\u201d Bennett warned. \u201cIf Airbus decides it wants to turn the tap off, it will. Our investments are in a holding pattern at the moment.\u201d",

The proposals offer manufacturers some comfort in a few key areas.</p> <p>It wants to establish a free trade area that would remove the need for customs checks and controls between the UK and the EU \u2013 as if in a combined customs territory \u2013 while enabling the UK to control tariffs for its own trade with the rest of the world.</p> <p>It also suggests that EU citizens could come to the UK without visas to do \u201cpaid work in limited and clearly defined circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>Bennett said: \u201cWe are cautiously optimistic about the Chequers agreement and white paper. It is a step in the right direction.\u201d But she added that clarity on the future trading relationship between Britain and the EU was essential for businesses to be able to plan.</p> <p>Derek Butler, 72, who worked at the wing production plant for more than 20 years, said it would be devastating for the area if Airbus were to close Broughton and move work elsewhere.</p> <p>Now a councillor with the local Flintshire authority, he said: \u201cThese things go down overnight and take generations to build back. It is absolutely a national issue.\u201d</p> <p>Butler, who voted Remain, believes the likes of Airbus, Jaguar Land Rover, Siemens and Nissan should have spelled out the Brexit risks to their UK businesses a lot sooner: \u201cThe big players are only now walking out to the wicket.\u201d </p> <p>Bennett said that because of the manufacturer\u2019s internal market, Airbus in the UK already has to compete with other locations in the group for work on future programmes: \u201cMy counterpart in Berlin tells me that he is constantly being asked by German politicians and staff, \u2018Is this an opportunity to get more work for Hamburg?\u2019 But Airbus is saying that if the work goes anywhere, it won\u2019t be in the EU; it will go to China.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56aaaa1812e8883725f0b1e0b56c0b8e05996ca5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56aaaa1812e8883725f0b1e0b56c0b8e05996ca5/0_261_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The main assembly hall at Airbus\u2019s Filton plant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The main assembly hall at Airbus\u2019s Filton plant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since it raised its concerns about Britain quitting the EU, Airbus has been approached by at least seven governments looking to poach future wing production work. The group is currently assessing plans for its next A320 single-aisle plane. It has been courted by France, Germany and Spain, as well as the US and China \u2013 where it has assembly lines \u2013 and even Mexico and South Korea.</p> <p>Airbus may have an opportunity to select a new wing-assembly hub for the A320 programme. Plans for the next generation of this family of narrow-body planes call for lightweight, all-composite wings in a drive to cut fuel consumption by 30%. The group\u2019s Spanish operation has invested a lot in composite manufacturing, Bennett said, so it is \u201cquite well-placed to bid for more work\u201d.</p> <p>She also shot down claims from some Brexiters that Airbus would never send work to China. \u201cWe already have a final assembly line for the A320 in Tianjin, and they also do wings there,\u201d she noted. \u201cIt makes four A320s a month at the moment and that may go up. So that\u2019s one site the wing work could go to.\u201d</p> <p>A tour of the Filton plant reveals why it is important for Britain to retain its status as Airbus\u2019s centre of excellence for wing design and production. The wings that are eventually built at Broughton are all designed at Filton. The wings are the most complex bit of the giant aircraft jigsaw.</p> <p>Anthony Meisner is one of a team designing the <a href=\"https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/news/en/2017/01/Wings-of-the-future.html\" title=\"\">\u201cwing of the future\u201d</a> for Airbus planes, with the aid of a 3D software package. He dims the lights in Filton\u2019s virtual reality suite and brings up a crystal-clear 3D image of an aircraft wing on a giant screen.</p> <p>The image can be accessed from 25 similar suites across the group\u2019s sites, allowing design engineers and heads of manufacturing from Germany, France, Spain and the UK to view the same image and discuss any potential design flaws long before they create an issue on the assembly line.</p> <p>Meisner, who has worked on the project for 18 months, said: \u201cThis allows us to be around the same component, even though we are in different rooms.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9d301055ed026b0cdb602ad9a5b392465541a5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9d301055ed026b0cdb602ad9a5b392465541a5a/0_161_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Testing the A350 landing gear at Filton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Testing the A350 landing gear at Filton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With a few clicks of a console he manipulates the image, pulling off panels and zooming in for a detailed look at the smallest components inside the wing, then pans out to reveal another intriguing new feature.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re developing a folding wing tip,\u201d he said. \u201cOn a single-aisle jet like the A320, this gives a longer wing and is more aerodynamic, but it will also fit into the airport gate when folded.\u201d</p> <p>The current wing span for an A320 is 36 metres; Airbus is considering a span of between 40 and 44 metres for the folding wing.</p> <p>Mark Howard, head of research and technology business development at Airbus UK, noted that the group is introducing more automation with each aircraft programme. He also reckons the new wing will create drag improvements of 12%.</p> <p>\u201cSo that\u2019s pretty important because that means less fuel burn,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means that you don\u2019t need as much thrust to push it through the air, which means you can reduce engine weight. It\u2019s a snowball effect in terms of aircraft design.\u201d</p> <p>When the future wing goes into production \u2013 which will be within the next 10 years \u2013 Airbus will have to make a huge investment to automate large parts of the manufacturing and assembly process. These big investment decisions could be make-or-break ones for Broughton \u2013 and for Britain\u2019s place at the top table of the aerospace industry.</p> <p>\u201cProposals are being put on our table for investment all the time. But there is no guarantee that the next wing or product will come to us,\u201d Bennett warned. \u201cIf Airbus decides it wants to turn the tap off, it will. Our investments are in a holding pattern at the moment.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The latest skirmish in the never-ending war between Airbus and Boeing, the duopoly at the heart of the commercial aerospace industry, will be fought at the Farnborough airshow this week. It has not been a vintage year for either half of this great corporate rivalry as they vied for new aircraft orders without much success. The American producer Boeing has snagged orders for 306 planes so far in 2018, including 193 for its short-haul 737 and 83 for the long-distance 787 Dreamliner. Airbus, its European arch-competitor, has had a slow start to the year, with net orders for just 206 planes, mostly its popular short-haul A320neo. The sluggish sales rate means their rivalry is unlikely to reach the dizzy heights of 2014, when Airbus soared to 1,753 orders, while Boeing bagged 1,451. There are buyers out there, though. Boeing hopes to ink deals for cargo freighters at Farnborough and lists 72 orders from \u201cunidentified customers\u201d on its website. It is thought these orders, and more, will be unveiled this week. Airbus has 111 aircraft listed for \u201cunidentified customers\u201d. Nor is the relatively low number of aircraft orders of great concern, according to Chris Tarry, founder of Ctaira, an aviation consultancy. \u201cIt has been a bit slow because we\u2019ve had a lot of orders over the past few years and backlogs remain at record levels,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will still be ordering where there are gaps.\u201d There are plenty of other sub-plots in the rivalry to provide gripping drama at Farnborough. Airbus has suffered the reputational ignominy of an A380 owner preparing to strip the \u201csuperjumbo\u201d for parts due to lack of demand, a sad chapter in one of the most ambitious and expensive projects in its history. Saudi Arabian Airlines is eyeing up to 20 Boeing wide-body aircraft and could announce an order at the show. The carrier is said to prefer Boeing\u2019s 777X ahead of the A380. Europe\u2019s aerospace champion has also been hamstrung by stuttering engine programmes, with problems at the US company Pratt &amp; Whitney and the Franco-US engine maker CFM International delaying delivery of planes such as its A320neo. This is a plotline that may spill into Farnborough as sources say the engine makers could receive stinging criticism from senior Airbus executives. Delays on the A320neo threaten to expose Airbus and its engine suppliers to late penalties from frustrated customers. \u201cThe big question is, have Pratt &amp; Whitney and CFM got their engines sorted yet or not? Because at the moment Airbus is producing gliders,\u201d an industry source said. \u201cAirbus could crucify Pratt &amp; Whitney.\u201d Airbus does at least have something to shout about with an aircraft in the same family, the A321neo LR, which is attracting admiring glances after being upgraded with 500 nautical miles of extra range. Tarry says Boeing will attempt to distract from this by making much of its planned 797, with around 230 seats and a 5,000-mile range. \u201cBoeing are great at diverting attention from what Airbus is doing but the 797 is still a paper plane,\u201d he said. \u201cIs there are a market there? They claim there is, but it\u2019s a 767 replacement and if I\u2019m an airline that wants to fly 200 passengers 5,000 miles, I\u2019ll either take a 757 or the A321neo LR.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s trade dispute with China is also giving Boeing pause for thought. The prospect of high tariffs on US aerospace firms could mean an imminent crimp on sales to a fast-growing market. Airbus is sure to be targeting China Eastern Airlines, which is thought to have called on jet makers to bid for 150 aircraft, worth around $8bn. Boeing\u2019s best hope is that China Eastern already has 130 of its aircraft, and airlines like owning planes from the same family because it saves on costs such as maintenance and pilot training. Another interesting development has been the tussle for the regional jet market, where demand over the next two decades is forecast to be high. Airbus recently took ownership of Bombardier\u2019s C-Series jet programme, since rebranded the A220, and secured a $5.4bn order last week from JetBlue for 60. Boeing has responded by snapping up the A220/C-Series\u2019 main rival, Embraer, in a $4.75bn venture that will give it control of the Brazilian manufacturer\u2019s commercial aircraft and services business. These two large deals have opened up a new battlefront in a decades-old conflict.",
