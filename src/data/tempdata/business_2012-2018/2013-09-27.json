      "bodyText": "New Landsbanki, the state-owned Icelandic bank forged in the midst of the 2008 Icesave scandal, has asked for more time to repay a \u00a31.5bn bond that is threatening to destabilise Iceland's recovering economy. At a meetingon Friday in London with creditors to the old bank, which include the British and Netherlands governments, Icelandic negotiators are understood to have said New Landsbanki will go bust if it is forced to stick to a steep repayment schedule, in euros, from the start of next year. Moreover, the Central Bank of Iceland has said publicly the country cannot support the schedule. \"The repayment profile ... is too heavy for the economy. The bonds will have to be extended or refinanced,\" it said. New Landsbanki was formed five years ago by taking the Icelandic assets of the failed bank out of the administration process, in return issuing the bonds that are soon due to be repaid. New Landsbanki is a solvent bank servicing Icelandic customers. The highly charged meeting is thought to be the first time British and Dutch officials involved in the poisonous Icesave dispute have sat across the table from Icelandic government representatives since a European court ruled in January that Iceland was under no legal obligation to honour deposit guarantees promised to foreign Icesave savers. The Efta court, which ensures compliance with EU law in Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, also ruled that politicians in Reykjavik had not been discriminatory when they enacted emergency laws safeguarding domestic deposits transferred to New Landsbanki but not those of overseas Icesave savers. One Icelandic source with knowledge of Friday's meeting said: \"It is an extremely, extremely sensitive situation.\" Ahead of the meeting, another well-placed source said: \"I don't expect the Icelanders will get a very warm reception.\" Concerns have been growing that Iceland might, yet again, turn on foreign creditors of its failed banks \u2013 not least because of the aggressive election rhetoric of Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, leader of the nationalist Progressive party, who swept to power in April at the helm of a centre-right coalition. He wants to introduce pro-business tax cuts and offer debt relief to all Icelandic households. He has hinted that he could extract the money to fund these moves from foreign creditors in exchange for agreeing to exempt them from Iceland's increasingly tight capital controls. \"We have a unique opportunity to be compensated for the loss incurred in recent years,\" he said on a blogpost in April. \"That opportunity must not be lost!\" Gunnlaugsson's popularity owes much to his links with the InDefence grassroots campaign which blocked previous attempts to reach a settlement of the Icesave dispute, defeating proposals in national plebiscites, forcing the matter to the Efta court. The decision of the court in January was a vindication of his position and a humiliating blow for the previous government which, under pressure from the EU, had sought to reach a settlement and avoid a courtroom confrontation, fearing it could destroy Iceland's international standing. As priority claimants to the old Landsbanki estate, British and Dutch authorities, together with many UK local authorities and charities, have received 55% of their original claim, and administrators hope to make a full recovery for them. However, they have been told outstanding recoveries will take years to come through. Moreover, if, as expected, capital controls remain in existence, payouts to creditors will effectively have to be signed off by the Icelandic government. \"I expect these estates to be hanging over us for at least five to ten years,\" said one well-placed source. January's court ruling effectively ended a four and a half year diplomatic and legal row over whether the Icelandic state could, or should, be compelled to stand behind the Icesave deposit guarantees. The foreign governments and their deposit guarantee schemes had reluctantly become the largest creditors to the old Landsbanki, now known as LBI, in October 2008 after finance ministers for both the UK and the Netherlands directed that hundreds of thousands of retail savers with Icesave should be refunded in full using taxpayer funds. So outraged was the then British chancellor, Alistair Darling, at what he saw as an illegal act, that he had used anti-terrorism powers to freeze the UK assets of Landsbanki for more than six months. Prior to the crash, British and Dutch depositors had rushed to put their money in Icesave online accounts in 2007 and 2008, attracted by market-leading interest rates. On the Icesave website, UK savers had been told: \"You can also rest assured that with Icesave you are offered the same level of financial protection as every bank in the UK.\" Behind the scenes UK financial regulators had been pressing old Landsbanki to convert its branch operation in the UK, which had taken \u00a34.3bn in Icesave deposits, into a full subsidiary business supervised by the Financial Service Authority.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Smart politics, vague economics. Four days after Ed Miliband launched his bold new energy policy, it remains hard to say that Labour has a fully formed plan. The leader of the opposition deserves applause for igniting a debate. The proposal to freeze prices for 20 months has pushed energy to the top of the political agenda, exactly where it should be, and sown confusion in government ranks. Bullseye. But the other challenge was to explain how the lights will stay on, how investment in low-carbon infrastructure will be financed and how bills can be made permanently affordable. On that score, Miliband's vision was just a sketch. Labour's hope is that the big six companies, given a jolt and a fiercer regulator, can be made to fight like ferrets. There probably are gains to be made this way. Obfuscation has been the big six's best friend. Their price tariffs make the head spin and their allocation of overheads between their supply and generation arms invites suspicion. But let's not pretend that a blast of stiffer competition, and the introduction of a transparent price pool, is a cure-all. The queue of new entrants wishing to risk their reputations and capital in the energy supply market may turn out to be short. Supermarkets, touted as a truer consumer champions, may have enough on their plates dealing with the online revolution in their backyard. Greater competition may force prices downwards only marginally. In the meantime, the bill for greener power generation and transmission will continue to push in the opposite direction. The firm rule under successive governments has been that the customer must pay to meet EU targets on greenhouse gases. Labour is not challenging that orthodoxy. So, once the price freeze ends in 2017, how will bills be kept permanently lower if wholesale prices do not fall? Labour's answer is that it will \"reset\" the market and provide \"policy certainty\" that will encourage \u00a3110bn of investment. But its mechanism is the same as the current set-up \u2013 an array of subsidies and contracts for difference enshrined in the energy bill to encourage the building of offshore windfarms and new nuclear power stations. These subsidies cost money, and the bill ultimately lands on consumers. It is simply unrealistic to hope that private companies can be cajoled into making investments where they cannot see a profit. Yes, the directors of Centrica et al should be given a prod. They could compete harder, cut costs, and even pay themselves less. But in the end, a government wishing to address energy bills has a limited number of big options. It can delay the decarbonisation targets (tricky given the assessment on climate change from the United Nations). It can persuade the voters the bill is worth paying. Or it can shift the burden towards general taxation, thereby obliging the better-off to pay. What has Labour chosen? It's impossible to tell. Nothing to do with me guvnor Dear Mr Carney, it's now your fault if the UK suffers a damaging house price bubble. George Osborne, one assumes, didn't put it like that as he handed the Bank of England powers to curb the efficacy of his flagship Help to Buy scheme. But the whiff of panic in the Treasury is unmistakable. The realisation has dawned that stoking up house price inflation is playing with fire. Indeed. It is obvious to anybody in London and the south east that house prices do not need tickling up to encourage builders to build. Prices in the capital are rising 10% annually, and the pace is accelerating, according to the Nationwide. Dishing out state-subsidised mortgages on houses worth up to \u00a3600,000 in these circumstances is plainly dangerous. But the chancellor's supposed new safeguard \u2013 monitoring by the Bank's financial policy committee (FPC) \u2013 is nothing of the sort. The FPC will not be allowed to review Help to Buy until next September, which might be too late. In theory, of course, the FPC can intervene in the housing market whenever it wishes. It can increase lenders' capital requirements against high loan-to-value mortgages, for example. In reality, though, any interference would be difficult \u2013 the Bank would be seen to be trying to cool high-risk mortgage lending just as the Treasury is piling in with guarantees to lenders. The best way to avoid that mess was surely to give the FPC the power to cancel the second stage of Help to Buy at any time. Embarrassing, but the right thing to do. Quantitative easing and interest rates are reviewed every month. What's the difference? Race to the post Get your skates on if you want to buy some Royal Mail shares \u2013 the government, anxious to get in ahead of likely strike action, is privatising at speed. A fortnight today the deed will be done. To emphasise the fact to Royal Mail workers, who will be given 10% of the shares, the prospectus says management does not \"currently\" expect a strike to affect the dividend policy. The not-so-subtle implication: push this too far and your \u00a32,000-worth of freebie shares will fall in value. That's the new world at the Royal Mail. Will the free shares for staff improve industrial relations over time? It's anybody's guess. The same might be said about whether the shares are a buy. There's an eye-catching dividend yield (if those \"current\" intentions are honoured) even at the top of the price range of 260p-330p. It works out at a utility-like 6.1%. At the bottom end, the yield is 7.7%, which definitely looks attractive. Unfortunately for Joe Public there is no way to express a wish to buy, say, up to 290p but not above. Retail investors get the price established by orders from City investors, who enjoy the privilege of setting limits on what they are willing to pay via a \"book-build\" process. This is clearly necessary to protect the public purse. But it's tough on retail punters who can't know in advance the price they'll be expected to pay. It can't be that hard to build a program that allows retail investors to participate in a book-build. Goldman Sachs and UBS are joint global co-ordinator and joint bookrunners; eBay would have been a better pick. Probably cheaper too. Nokia chief Mircosoft exit Is it Stephen Elop, outgoing chief of Nokia, getting a payoff from the Finnish firm or a golden hello from his next employer, Microsoft, which also happens to be a former employer? Either way, the upshot of this tangled tale is that Elop gets \u20ac18.8m (\u00a316m), which is a hell of a sum given the collapse in Nokia's share price on his watch. \"Quite outrageous,\" says the Finland's premier. You bet. Elop is departing with Nokia's mobile phone business and won't miss a beat as he takes up a senior post at Microsoft. The curious sub-plot here is that Elop, it is reported in Finland, was asked to return some of the money but replied that he couldn't because he was divorcing his wife. Surely there was a simple solution: give Mrs Elop her share of the winnings and invite Mr Elop to forego the rest. The answer, one suspects, would still have been \"no\".",

It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A modest recovery is expected to start in late 2013, supported by net exports. After sharp declines in previous years, domestic demand is expected to recover slowly in the face of stiff headwinds from tight credit conditions. On this basis, growth is projected at -1.8 percent this year, before rising to 0.7 percent next year. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, stemming mainly from potential policy slippages and banking weaknesses.</p> <p>In the absence of further structural reforms, medium-term growth is projected to remain low. The origins of Italy\u2019s low trend growth pre-date the crisis and stem from its stagnant productivity, difficult business environment, and leveraged public sector. The inefficient judicial system has also been linked to the high cost of doing business, low inward foreign direct investment, as well as the small size of firms and capital markets. Weak productivity has also contributed to Italy\u2019s gradually widening competitiveness gap.</p> <p>Directors welcomed the growth package and labor market measures passed during the summer, but emphasized that further reforms are needed to boost productivity and raise the employment rate, especially of youth and women. They encouraged the authorities to improve active labor market policies, simplify contracts, decentralize wage setting, and reduce the labor tax wedge. Directors also highlighted the key role judicial system reforms would play in improving the business environment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-27T16:51:05.957Z\">at 5.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5245b4ece4b0f2e0c7543739\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-27T16:41:15.505Z\">5.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Italy plans to suspend October's sales tax rise until January, according to a draft decree, </strong>Reuters is reporting.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-27T16:41:35.980Z\">at 5.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5245b20ee4b0c07967813a84\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-27T16:39:53.442Z\">5.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mission heads representing Greece's troika of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF are holding talks with finance minister Yannis Stournaras. </strong>Helena Smith writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Visiting inspectors are deep in discussion in Stournaras\u2019 sixth floor office.

While yields rose somewhat, the Treasury was able to get all its debt out the door. Over the past year or so, Italy's government bond market and the country's perennially unstable politics have existed in parallel worlds. Yet the stakes have risen considerably this week following the centre-right Forza Italia party's threat of a mass resignation from parliament if a senate committee votes to strip Silvio Berlusconi of his seat in the upper house. Forza Italia has made it patently clear that it's putting Mr Berlusconi's interests above those of premier Enrico Letta's coalition government. Although a snap election is by no means a foregone conclusion at this stage, and brinkmanship is the norm in Italian politics, Mr Letta's cabinet is paralysed and unable to govern.</p> <p>Italy is becoming more politically unstable with each passing day just as the economy is showing flickering signs of life. The whiff of crisis and further rating downgrades is in the air. Politically and economically speaking, Italy is in worse shape now than when it was dragged into the eurozone crisis in July 2011.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-524558d7e4b0f2e0c75436fa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-27T10:22:33.919Z\">11.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fed bubbles and growing inequality</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>He's one of the most vocal critics of the government's Help to Buy scheme.

The Bank of England admitted as much a year ago. Specifically it said that its QE programme had boosted the value of stocks and bonds by 25%, or about $970 billion. It then calculated that about 40% of those gains went to the richest 5 percent of British households...</p> <p>Does this level of extreme inequality matter and, if so, can anything be done? Yes and yes. I believe the 99% who have missed out on the fruits of recovery will demand change and will not be bought off with another housing bubble designed, as before, to divert their attention from the continued appropriation of the fruits of their labour by the 1%.

The second part of the scheme, which will launch in January 2014, will offer lenders a guarantee to let them lend large mortgages on properties costing up to \u00a3600,000. The FPC could recommend that the cap is reduced.</p> <p>Lenders will pay for the guarantee, and the cost will have an impact on the rates they charge borrowers. The FPC could also recommend that the price is raised, which will increase the cost of the mortgage and dampen demand.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-27T12:55:13.985Z\">at 1.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52455103e4b04fc12170602b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-27T09:53:21.909Z\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone sentiment at two-year high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Numbers out from the European Commission this morning suggest business morale in the eurozone is at a two-year high.</p> <p>The commission's statistics arm, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/db_indicators/surveys/index_en.htm\">Eurostat</a>, says that in September the Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) increased by 1.6 points in the euro area (to 96.9) and 2.4 points in the EU (to 100.6).

The scheme cannot be reviewed until next September and reducing the \u00a3600k cap is unlikely to be a big deal for the bulk of the country outside London. Even then it might make little difference given that many lenders have lower self-imposed caps for risky mortgages anyway. Changing the price could be important, but the FPC has said it will take a \u201cgraduated approach\u201d on the housing market, so they seem unlikely to change the fees substantially and soon...</p> <p>All that being said, if this change of heart is an indicator of the direction policy is heading then it could be significant. The full details of this mortgage guarantee scheme have not been finalised yet, most significantly the fees the government will charge. They could be set high enough that the scheme has little effect. That would be sensible in our view. The housing market would still be boosted by improving mortgage availability and very low interest rates, but some of the worst upside risks would be removed. While politics may prevent a full cancellation of the scheme, fully implementing it would not be a risk worth taking.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52452bcbe4b0161c92c1c7f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-27T07:25:42.779Z\">8.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">House price rise fuels bubble fears</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More now on today\u2019s house price story and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/27/help-to-buy-osborne-bank-england-restrain-housing-boom\">George Osborne\u2019s attempts to allay fears</a> the UK is headed for another bubble.</p> <p>His critics have more fuel this morning from the Nationwide house price survey.

Housing market activity is now really stepping up a gear, supported by markedly strengthening consumer confidence and elevated employment, and fuelled by the Funding for Lending Scheme and the Help to Buy initiative. On top of this, the Bank of England has indicated that interest rates are unlikely to rise before mid-2016, which seems likely to give many people greater confidence in their ability to purchase a house.</p> <p>Consequently we expect house prices to rise by around 2% over the final quarter of 2013 and to then increase by 7% in 2014. These projected house price rises are expected to be driven by increases in London (especially) and parts of the South East.

Thanks for all the comments, and we'll be back next week. More on the Italian tax position. Reuters is reporting the government will increase advance payments of corporation tax and raise excise duties to make up for a suspension of a planned rise in sales tax. Silvio Berlusconi's PDL is opposed to the sales tax rise, but beyond that has threatened to plunge the country into political turmoil by quitting the government. As Italy's government struggles with its financial difficulties amidst the threat of a collapse of the fragile coalition, the International Monetary Fund had chosen this moment to issue its latest report on the country. It said: A modest recovery is expected to start in late 2013, supported by net exports. After sharp declines in previous years, domestic demand is expected to recover slowly in the face of stiff headwinds from tight credit conditions. On this basis, growth is projected at -1.8 percent this year, before rising to 0.7 percent next year. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, stemming mainly from potential policy slippages and banking weaknesses. In the absence of further structural reforms, medium-term growth is projected to remain low. The origins of Italy\u2019s low trend growth pre-date the crisis and stem from its stagnant productivity, difficult business environment, and leveraged public sector. The inefficient judicial system has also been linked to the high cost of doing business, low inward foreign direct investment, as well as the small size of firms and capital markets. Weak productivity has also contributed to Italy\u2019s gradually widening competitiveness gap. Directors welcomed the growth package and labor market measures passed during the summer, but emphasized that further reforms are needed to boost productivity and raise the employment rate, especially of youth and women. They encouraged the authorities to improve active labor market policies, simplify contracts, decentralize wage setting, and reduce the labor tax wedge. Directors also highlighted the key role judicial system reforms would play in improving the business environment. Italy plans to suspend October's sales tax rise until January, according to a draft decree, Reuters is reporting. Mission heads representing Greece's troika of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF are holding talks with finance minister Yannis Stournaras. Helena Smith writes: Visiting inspectors are deep in discussion in Stournaras\u2019 sixth floor office. The negotiations, focused mostly on the 2013 budget, come ahead of what one official described as \u201can extremely important meeting\u201d with prime minister Antonis Samaras tomorrow morning. It will be the first time the leader has met auditors since their return to Athens last weekend \u2013 and both sides are saying openly that there are several sticking points. Yesterday, the mission heads walked out of a scheduled meeting with the labour minister apparently in disagreement over how to plug am \u201cunexpected\u201d black hole in the labour ministry's budget. Earlier today, troika officials met the administrative reform minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis but failed to give him an answer to his plea that Greece be given more time to streamline the bloated public sector. All three lenders want the government to place another 12,500 civil servants on reduced pay in a so-called mobility scheme by the end of the year. The representatives are also demanding that Greece close three loss-making defence and mining companies \u2013 a \u201cred line\u201d for Samaras. Such reforms are vital to Athens receiving its next cash installment of \u20ac1bn in October. The Greek prime minister has his work cut out for him tomorrow. European markets have closed on a mostly downbeat note, with worries about the Italian political situation, the continuing uncertainty in Greece and, across the Atlantic, the threat of a US government shutdown next month if the impasse over the country's budget and debt ceiling is not resolved. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 52.93 points or 0.81% lower at 6512.66 \u2022 Germany's Dax dipped 0.03% to 8661.51 \u2022 France's Cac closed up 0.05% at4186.77 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB fell 1.27% to 17,646 \u2022 Spain's Ibex lost 0.47% to 9228.4 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 66 points or 0.43% More from Italy: In Greece the government has ruled out fresh elections should Golden Dawn act on its pledge to walk out of parliament. Helena Smith writes: The Greek government is working fast to take the wind out of the sails of Golden Dawn following its leader\u2019s threat to withdraw all 18 of his party\u2019s MPS from Athens\u2019 300-seat House. With political stability key to the debt-stricken country\u2019s economic recovery, the government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou not only described the threat as \u201cblackmail,\u201d but insisted that if the far right group walked out of parliament by-elections would be held to replace MPs. \u201cDemocracy cannot be blackmailed,\u201d he told a radio interviewer. \u201cIf we need to have by-elections, they will be held in the constituencies where MPs have to be replaced.\u201d With tensions running high, three Golden Dawn MPs lodged a suit against Pasok, the junior partner in prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 two-party coalition, labeling it a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d unfit to rule. It was the first step in a campaign by the neo-fascist organization to turn the tables after almost two weeks of public outrage over its alleged role in the fatal stabbing of Pavlos Fyssas, a hip hop artist popular on the anti-fascist scene. In a sign that the extremists are far from down \u2013 despite polls showing a dip in support for them \u2013 the party\u2019s spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris, who is not known for his humour, joked that they were visiting the Supreme Court \u201cto turn ourselves in\u201d \u2013 a thinly disguised reference to the ongoing inquiry into accusations they are a criminal organization. The Greek president Karolos Papoulias, who has repeatedly voiced fears over the threat of fascism revisiting Greece, said this afternoon that \u201cthe entire Greek nation is awaiting the results of the inquiry.\u201d Italy's cabinet is due to meet this evening to find new measures to avert a planned rise in sales tax while sticking to its budget deficit targets, not to mention avoiding a government collapse. Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party is opposed to the sales tax, which is due to come into effect in October, but the government needs to find \u20ac1bn of savings to delay the measure for three months. PDL has threatened to quit the government, causing a new political crisis. The cabinet meeting is due to start at 17.30 GMT. Austria goes to the polls this weekend, and it's fair to say the event has not caused as much comment as the German election last Sunday. The coalition of Chancellor Werner Faymann's Social Democrats and the conservative People's party is expected to win the day, despite a number of challengers, not least the eurosceptics. Here's a quick Q&amp;A on the main issues, courtesy of the BBC. Jill Treanor's full story on the latest bank branch sale is now up, and here's a flavour: A consortium backed by the Church of England will be among the new owners of 314 branches being sold by bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland. The Church Commissioners, which manages \u00a35.5bn of investments to support the church, has backed the bid put together by private equity firms Corsair Capital \u2013 where Lord Davies, the former boss of Standard Chartered is vice-chairman - and Centrebridge, and the fund manager Rothschild. RBS has been forced to sell the branches by the EU as a result of its 2008/9 bailout by the government and is reviving a defunct brand \u2013 Williams &amp; Glyn's \u2013 to allow the branches to be separated off from its existing network. However, the W&amp;G name \u2013 last seen in 1986 \u2013 is unlikely to appear on high streets until the end of next year. Back with Greece and here's a piece of video up on our site, with a young Greek woman talking about how she was set upon by two supporters of Greece's far-right movement Golden Dawn. Over in the US, consumer confidence fell in September to its lowest in five months. Not surprising, perhaps, given all the talk about the US Federal Reserve possibly bringing its $85bn a month bond buying programme to an end, with the prospect of interest rate rises to follow. On top of that there is the current political impasse over the US budget and debt ceiling with a possible shutdown of the government early next month (below). So the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index fell to 77.5 in September from 82.1 the previous month, its lowest reading since April and below forecasts of 78. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy pointed to other possible factors behind the fall: Higher fuel prices and some pressures coming from the news of a still sluggish labour market and uncertain fiscal scenario are likely to have played a role in pushing confidence down over the month. Survey director Richard Curtin said: While few consumers expected a federal shutdown, complaints about government policies have risen, and more importantly, prospects for job growth have diminished. RBS's press office has tweeted a black and white picture to mark the announcement of the sale of its branches and the revival of a bank that disappeared from the high street nearly 30 years ago \u2013 Williams &amp; Glyn's. My colleague Jill Treanor wrote this piece on the background of the branches back in February. She wrote: Williams &amp; Glyn's was created by RBS in 1969 to unite its English and Welsh branches. It brought together three RBS business \u2013 Williams Deacon's Bank; Glyn, Mills &amp; Co and the English and Welsh branches of National Bank. It was disbanded in 1985 and, while RBS has suggested the use of the brand in the past, Hester [Stephen Hester, RBS's chief executive at the time] said its rebirth was now his \"baseline\" plan to dispose of the branches which the EU demanded be sold after the government rescue. RBS says: \"After nearly 30 years the bank Williams &amp; Glyn's will return to the UK high street as RBS agrees a \u00a3600m pre-IPO investment\" and also tweets: And on that note I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. A few minutes after the opening bell on Wall Street, stock markets are lower as investors continue to fret over the apparent gridlock in budget negotiations in Washington. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 0.5% at 15262. The newswire Associated Press has this summary of the latest state of affairs in Washington: The Democratic-led Senate was ready Friday to approve legislation to keep the U.S. government running, but disputes with the Republican-run lower chamber of Congress ensured that the battle would spill over into the weekend, as a potential shutdown hurtles closer. Infighting among Republican lawmakers added to unpredictability. The result: a high-stakes showdown that is playing out in a climate of chaos and that is extraordinary even by congressional standards. At issue is an effort led by hardcore conservatives to use a temporary spending bill needed by Tuesday to prevent a partial government shutdown as leverage to demolish President Barack Obama's health care reform, the signature accomplishment of his administration. The Senate planned votes Friday to approve the spending bill, minus the language approved by the House of Representatives that would strip funding from the 3-year-old health care law. That would bounce the legislation back to the House, where Republican leaders already have declared that the pared-down Senate bill was insufficient. But Republicans are divided on whether to insist on the health care provision, with some party leaders fearing they will get blamed for a shutdown that would undermine the fragile U.S. economic recovery. More than a third of the nation's 2.1 million federal workers would be told to stay home if the government shuts down, forcing the closure of national parks from California to Maine and all the Smithsonian museums in the nation's capital. US inequality and the recovery hype While we are on the topic of the US, readers of the earlier post about Albert Edwards' thoughts on American inequality will likely be interested in this comment from economics professor Richard Wolff: Recovery hype: American capitalism's weapon of mass distraction. He argues \"You don't have to be a Marxist to see how the 1% tries to fool us that we too are sharing in their renewed wealth. But it helps\" Read the full comment here. Thanks for Kit Juckes for flagging this on Twitter: Bloomberg has spotted an interesting record in the latest inflation figures for eurozone members. Angeline Benoit at the news service reports that Spain has opened the widest inflation gap with Germany in euro history. She writes: Price rises in Germany, the guardian of price stability in the euro region, are outstripping those in Spain by the widest margin since the creation of the single currency. Spanish consumer prices rose 0.5 percent from a year ago in September compared with a 1.6 percent increase in Germany, the bloc\u2019s largest economy, according to the EU-harmonized price gauge. The 1.1 percentage-point difference exceeded the 1 point spread that opened between the indexes in June 2009 during the first wave of the global financial crisis.

The Canadian smartphone maker says its revenues have halved in three months. Juliette Garside reports: Following Monday's agreement in principle to be taken private by the Canadian hedge fund Fairfax, BlackBerry said on Friday that revenues had fallen to $1.57bn in the August quarter, from $3bn in June. BlackBerry's new generation BB10 handsets have left consumers cold, and the company said on Friday it had booked a $934m charge on unsold units of the all touchscreen Z10 smartphone, on which chief executive Thorsten Heins had pinned hopes of a recovery. Her full story is here. Subsidising high loan-to-value mortgages in boom-bust UK housing market was political masterstroke \u2013 but economic madness, says my colleague Heather Stewart. Commenting on George Osborne's announcement the Bank of England will have more powers to review his Help to Buy scheme, Heather writes: It's not quite a U-turn on the scale of the pasty tax, or any of the various other elements of the 2012 budget that were subsequently chopped; but George Osborne's decision to allow the Bank of England to carry out an annual review of his flagship Help-to-Buy scheme is a major concession. The centrepiece of this year's budget, Help to Buy was a political masterstroke, pumping up public confidence just as many potential buyers were thinking about returning to the estate agent's, and helping the government to claim credit for an upswing in the property market that had already been kicked off by the Funding for Lending Scheme. Economically, however, Help to Buy is madness, as the Treasury select committee, the International Monetary Fund and the outgoing governor of the Bank of England all lined up to say.

I will keep it brief (given the Marmitesque love-it-or-hate-it reaction the BBC show can induce) but Waitrose says baking sales are up. And I leave the puns to Rob Collins, retail director at Waitrose, who comments: The Great British Bake Off effect has been whipping up demand for homebaking products, which have soared by 12%. Similarly, sugar is up 17% while pastry sales are up by 24%. Away from the aisles, the Waitrose Cookery School saw bookings leap last week. Its Perfect Macaroon class was the most requested course with budding patissiers. Baking classes continue to be highly sought-after with our chefs often asked for tips on replicating some of the show's signature bakes. Comments are just coming through from Spain's treasury minister that the deficit in 2012 was smaller than previously thought. The government now puts it at 6.84% of GDP, down from 6.98% previously announced. Cristobal Montoro also told a news conference that Spain is forecasting debt costs will fall 5.2% in 2014 compared with 2013 levels, Reuters reports. Earlier, the country has revised up its 2014 growth forecast from 0.5% to 0.7%. My colleague Rupert Neate has been looking into the timing of the Royal Mail sale. He writes: The government is racing to push through the \u00a33.3bn privatisation of Royal Mail before postmen and women have the chance to walkout on strike against the \"great British flog off\". Vince Cable, the business secretary, on Friday announced the coalition will sell up to 70% of the 497-year-old postal service on the stock market on 11 October. The announcement comes on the day that more than 100,000 postal workers begin voting on whether to take days of paralysing strike action. But the result of the ballot will not be known until 16 October with the earliest legal strike date not until 23 October. Rupert's full story is here. Joshua Raymond chief marketing strategist at spreadbetting group cityindex.co.uk has sent through this upbeat reaction to the Royal Mail latest: Whether or not the government manages to sell at the top of its guidance range remains a bit of a lottery considering the Royal Mail is no ordinary company, it\u2019s a British Institution with politics at play and the public has a chance to invest. Nevertheless, the early signs thus far are encouraging with a mere few weeks to go. And now, a bit of upbeat news from Spain. The country has just revised up its 2014 growth forecast from 0.5% to 0.7%. It also expects the unemployment rate to be at 26.6% at the end of 2013, still a worryingly high figure since it is currently 26.3% but less than previous predictions of 27.1%. This should fall to 25.9% at the end of next year, compared to earlier forecasts of 26.7%. It has also approved some public sector reforms, removing inflation-linked reviews of public wages, prices and indices used by public administrations. (Courtesy Reuters) Stock markets have fallen around Europe this morning, most markedly in the UK where investors were unsettled by Bank of England governor Mark Carney's remarks that he sees no grounds for more quantitative easing for now. Surely that is not a big surprise given the latest run of improving economic data in the UK but nevertheless it has lifted the pound against the dollar and the euro and left the FTSE 100 lower. Here's a full UK markets update from Nick Fletcher. This is how things are looking on stock markets: UK's FTSE 100 -0.9% at 6510 Germany's Dax -0.5% at 8625 France's CAC40 -0.4% at 4172 A round-up of the main news so far today: \u2022 New powers to be given to Bank of England to review Help-to-Buy annually \u2022 Golden Dawn threatens Greek parliament walkout \u2022 Eurozone sentiment at two-year high \u2022 BoE's Carney sees no need for more QE, for now \u2022 German poll shows 48% support grand coalition \u2022 Royal Mail seen topping \u00a33bn \u2022 Italy pays bond auction price for latest political crisis ... and in case you missed the little Did You Know aside, the Office for National Statistics says that in the last 30 years the number of those aged 90 and over has almost tripled in England and Wales. In Italy, the political crisis is clearly making investors more nervous than usual and a bond auction by the government this morning saw it paying the highest yield for three months to borrow over 10 years. Reuters reports: The Treasury sold the top planned amount of \u20ac3bn of its March 2024 bond at an average 4.5% yield, up from 4.46% at the previous auction a month ago and reflecting an almost 20 basis point jump in market yields in the last day or so. A new pledge by allies of Silvio Berlusconi to resign en masse if the centre-right leader is ousted from parliament had triggered selling of Italian bonds on the eve of the auction. Nicholas Spiro at Spiro Sovereign Strategy sends through this comment: Not for the first time, and probably not for the last, Italy was able to sell its debt with relative ease in the face of a menacing political crisis. While yields rose somewhat, the Treasury was able to get all its debt out the door. Over the past year or so, Italy's government bond market and the country's perennially unstable politics have existed in parallel worlds. Yet the stakes have risen considerably this week following the centre-right Forza Italia party's threat of a mass resignation from parliament if a senate committee votes to strip Silvio Berlusconi of his seat in the upper house. Forza Italia has made it patently clear that it's putting Mr Berlusconi's interests above those of premier Enrico Letta's coalition government. Although a snap election is by no means a foregone conclusion at this stage, and brinkmanship is the norm in Italian politics, Mr Letta's cabinet is paralysed and unable to govern. Italy is becoming more politically unstable with each passing day just as the economy is showing flickering signs of life. The whiff of crisis and further rating downgrades is in the air. Politically and economically speaking, Italy is in worse shape now than when it was dragged into the eurozone crisis in July 2011. He's one of the most vocal critics of the government's Help to Buy scheme. Now City commentator Albert Edwards has turned his fire on the Fed's policy after it delayed tapering its stimulus programme and what he sees \"another house price boom\" in the US. Edwards, who heads the global strategy team at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, asks in his latest weekly \"alternative view\" note \"Is the Fed blowing bubbles to cover up growing inequality?\" He comments: They\u2019re at it again! US inequality is surging and the Fed has created another house price boom. Does this matter? Well I think so. But who cares what I think. Warren Buffet, Bill Gross and Stanley Druckenmiller think it matters. Clients marvel at how the US profits\u2019 share of GDP remains so high and that labour remains so weak... We know Quantitative Easing has mainly helped the rich. The Bank of England admitted as much a year ago. Specifically it said that its QE programme had boosted the value of stocks and bonds by 25%, or about $970 billion. It then calculated that about 40% of those gains went to the richest 5 percent of British households... Does this level of extreme inequality matter and, if so, can anything be done? Yes and yes. I believe the 99% who have missed out on the fruits of recovery will demand change and will not be bought off with another housing bubble designed, as before, to divert their attention from the continued appropriation of the fruits of their labour by the 1%. I expect that ultimately, US capital gains (and dividend) tax rates will be brought into line with income tax. The Labour Party has sent through its reaction to George Osborne's move to ask the Bank of England to review his Help to Buy scheme next September and once a year after that. The opposition says waiting till then is too long. Ed Balls, Labour's Shadow Chancellor, comments: Instead of waiting a year, the Bank of England should review the details of the second phase of Help to Buy now before it goes ahead. For instance, it's totally ill-thought through for George Osborne to decide that a scheme which should be about helping first time buyers will allow taxpayer backed mortgages for homes worth up to \u00a3600,000. And George Osborne is still failing to address the fundamental problem of the lowest level of house building since the 1920s. You can't deal with the cost of living crisis without building more homes. Rising demand for housing must be matched with rising supply. Unless George Osborne acts now to build more affordable homes, as Labour has urged, then he risks making it even harder for first time buyers to get on the housing ladder. It's no wonder that for millions of families this is no recovery at all. Click here, for our news story on Osborne's plan to give the Bank of England greater powers to prevent the Help to Buy scheme causing a property boom. And our Money experts have just updated their Q&amp;A on how could Mark Carney and the FPC could use their new extra powers to try to stop a house price bubble. Read the full article here. An extract on the latest plans: What power has been added? Concerns that Help to Buy will fuel further price rises have led the chancellor to review the scheme every September. The second part of the scheme, which will launch in January 2014, will offer lenders a guarantee to let them lend large mortgages on properties costing up to \u00a3600,000. The FPC could recommend that the cap is reduced. Lenders will pay for the guarantee, and the cost will have an impact on the rates they charge borrowers. The FPC could also recommend that the price is raised, which will increase the cost of the mortgage and dampen demand. Numbers out from the European Commission this morning suggest business morale in the eurozone is at a two-year high. The commission's statistics arm, Eurostat, says that in September the Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) increased by 1.6 points in the euro area (to 96.9) and 2.4 points in the EU (to 100.6). It adds: In the euro area, the strong increase resulted from markedly improved confidence across all business sectors, whereby improvements in construction and retail trade were particularly pronounced. Economic sentiment improved in three of the five largest euro area economies, namely in Spain (+2.5), Italy (+2.5) and France (+1.6). Sentiment in Germany remained broadly unchanged (+0.3), while it worsened somewhat in the Netherlands (-0.9). ... Employment plans were revised upwards in industry, services, retail trade and construction. David Tinsley economist at BNP Paribas comments: The European Commission Confidence surveys continued to move higher in September, confirming our view that the recovery in the European economy has some forward momentum... The European Commission surveys are a relatively good coincident indicator for the EU economy. As such they confirm the picture in our latest Global Outlook, for a steady improvement in the eurozone economy, albeit at modest rates and with downside risks. For the UK the picture appears a bit different. Here the surveys are suggesting the economy is really stepping up a gear, and the economy could be poised for the best growth it has seen on a sustained basis since the financial crisis. In Greece, Bloomberg and others are reporting that the head of Greece\u2019s nationalist Golden Dawn party has suggested he could withdraw his politicians from parliament. Thanks to zerozero for bringing this up in the comments below. As Bloomberg says, such a move that could spark a series of by-elections and threaten the country\u2019s stability. The report continues: \u201cWithin the context of our legal constitutional rights we will exhaust all means to defend our political honor,\u201d Nikolaos Michaloliakos, the head of the party, told reporters late yesterday. When asked if his lawmakers quitting Parliament would destabilize the country, he responded: \u201cEverything is open. Golden Dawn will defend itself.\u201d Reuters is also reporting on the threatened walk out: If they quit, they would have to be replaced through special elections in every electoral district they represent, which includes most of the country's biggest. If such by-elections were won by the opposition, as some polls indicate, the country's fragile two-party ruling coalition would become politically untenable, Mihaloliakos argued. \"Golden Dawn holds a weapon in its hands to cause a political earthquake. Those in charge should bear that well in mind,\" he said. With political stability a key condition for the smooth going of Greece's EU/IMF bailout, senior officials have dismissed any notion that the government was under threat. By-elections would not lead to a general vote that could destabilise the country, Interior Minister Yannis Mihelakis said on Thursday. \"The whole affair has already damaged the country enough. A general election would just make things worse,\" he told Skai TV. \"It's not a threat. It's a great opportunity,\" deputy Prime Minister Evangelos Venizelos told Reuters on Wednesday after then unconfirmed reports that Golden Dawn was considering pulling its lawmakers. The Kathimerini English Edition take is here: The Office for National Statistics has released some numbers that will be of interest to demography watchers. \"Did you know\", it asks, \"that in the last 30 years the number of those aged 90 and over has almost tripled in England and Wales?\" I must mention my own Grandma Ruby at this point, 102 this month. It turns out she is one of more than 12,000 centenarians in England and Wales. The ONS key findings are: In 2012 there were estimated to be 465,500 people aged 90 and over living in England and Wales, just under 1% of the total population. Between 2002 and 2012 there has been a 33% increase in the number of those aged 90 and over. In 2012 in England and Wales, the number of centenarians (those aged 100 and over) was estimated to be 12,320. There were estimated to be 2.6 women per man aged 90 and over and 5.9 women per man aged 100 and over in England and Wales in 2012. The ONS also has numbers on where there are the most over 90s. The chart above tells the story best and the ONS summarises: Japan had by far the highest number of persons aged 90 and over per 100,000 population in 2012 at 1,197. With the exception of Japan and Eastern European countries, Europe tends to have the highest numbers of persons aged 90 and over per 100,000 population compared to other regions of the world. Among European countries, in 2012, Sweden and Italy had relatively high numbers, 995 and 908 persons aged 90 and over per 100,000 population respectively. Germany and Iceland had relatively low numbers of persons aged 90 and over; 592 per 100,000 in Germany (2010) and 499 per 100,000 in Iceland. In Germany, the latest poll for broadcaster ARD is showing almost half the public favour a grand coalition of chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the main centre-left SPD party. That option is favoured by 48% of Germans. Just 18% support a conservative-Green partnership. Coalition negotiations are expected to take weeks. The SPD's leaders are meeting in Berlin today to debate their options. Writing in their weekly note, the economics team at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, say they are confident a grand coalition will ultimately emerge following Merkel's victory in last weekend's election. They cite two main reasons (using different poll numbers): (1) the SPD holds a comfortable majority in the Bundesrat, which needs to approve all important legislative decisions; (2) voters are in favour of such a coalition, with 64% supporting it vs 32% supporting a \"Black-Green\" government. However, with the SPD appearing anything but eager to join Merkel as a junior coalition partner, Merkel may struggle to capitalise on her victory, putting the role of \"kingmaker\" firmly in the hands of the SPD. Coalition talks could lead to weeks of political brinkmanship, further perpetuating the political vacuum in the euro area. Now to the announcement from the UK government that it is offering shares in Royal Mail at between 260p and 330p each in its London listing, valuing the company at as much as \u00a33.3bn. The government plans to divest up to 70% of near 500-year-old Royal Mail, which is expected to make its market debut on 11 October. It has agreed to give away 10% of the company's shares for free to staff, equivalent to \u00a32,000 for each worker \u2013 the largest share giveaway of any major UK privatisation. Our full story is here. Business Secretary Vince Cable says in a statement: Today is an important day in the life of Royal Mail: people can now apply to buy shares in this iconic British brand. This will give Royal Mail access to the private capital it needs to modernise, as envisaged under successive governments, and enshrined in law by Parliament two years ago. We have already committed to give eligible Royal Mail staff a real stake in the company by giving them 10% of company shares for free. Now the sale of Government shares will give others a chance to have a real stake in this important company and we are encouraged by the interest shown by potential investors so far. But Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, who has branded the sale \"vandalism\" in the past is critical of the government: Mark Carney, the Bank of England's new governor, has been talking about the importance of getting out of London during a trip to Liverpool and Yorkshire. His comments to the Yorkshire Post that there is no case for now for more quantitative easing have buoyed the pound against the dollar this morning. Reuters have a longer take on his comments here. Carney tells the newspaper: My personal view is, given the recovery has strengthened and broadened, I don\u2019t see a case for quantitative easing and I have not supported it. Talking to the Liverpool Echo, the Canadian Everton fan was going for football diplomacy. The paper reports: Mr Carney said he had been an Everton fan since the 1980s, saying: \u201cI have cousins in Formby and Crosby and who are avid and rabid Evertonians.\u201d He snuck into Upton Park last Saturday to see them come from behind to beat West Ham 3-2 in a \u201cspectacular come-from-behind victory\u201d. But he smiled: \u201cEqually, as Governor of the Bank of England, I fully recognise the contribution of all the great football clubs in Merseyside and of all the great footballers that come out of Merseyside.\u201d Any watering down of the government's Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme set to start in January is \"good news\" says Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg. He sends through this reaction to George Osborne's plan to get the Bank of England to keep tabs on Help to Buy: The housing recovery is not just a result rocketing London prices, so considered in isolation this change looks like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. The scheme cannot be reviewed until next September and reducing the \u00a3600k cap is unlikely to be a big deal for the bulk of the country outside London. Even then it might make little difference given that many lenders have lower self-imposed caps for risky mortgages anyway. Changing the price could be important, but the FPC has said it will take a \u201cgraduated approach\u201d on the housing market, so they seem unlikely to change the fees substantially and soon... All that being said, if this change of heart is an indicator of the direction policy is heading then it could be significant. The full details of this mortgage guarantee scheme have not been finalised yet, most significantly the fees the government will charge. They could be set high enough that the scheme has little effect. That would be sensible in our view. The housing market would still be boosted by improving mortgage availability and very low interest rates, but some of the worst upside risks would be removed. While politics may prevent a full cancellation of the scheme, fully implementing it would not be a risk worth taking. More now on today\u2019s house price story and George Osborne\u2019s attempts to allay fears the UK is headed for another bubble. His critics have more fuel this morning from the Nationwide house price survey. It suggests house prices rose a solid 0.9% in September after a 0.7% rise in August. That was well above the consensus forecast for a 0.5% rise in a Reuters poll of economists. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight comments: The acceleration in house prices in October reported by the Nationwide will fuel concern that we could be on our way to a new housing bubble. House prices certainly look set to see further solid increases over the final months of 2013 and then strengthen appreciably during 2014. Housing market activity is now really stepping up a gear, supported by markedly strengthening consumer confidence and elevated employment, and fuelled by the Funding for Lending Scheme and the Help to Buy initiative. On top of this, the Bank of England has indicated that interest rates are unlikely to rise before mid-2016, which seems likely to give many people greater confidence in their ability to purchase a house. Consequently we expect house prices to rise by around 2% over the final quarter of 2013 and to then increase by 7% in 2014. These projected house price rises are expected to be driven by increases in London (especially) and parts of the South East. House prices in the rest of the UK are now generally firming but far from storming ahead. For anyone wanting more background on the government\u2019s Help to Buy scheme, here is a brief reading list: \u2022 All our Help to Buy scheme coverage is here. The scheme was introduced in April and provides equity loans for first-time buyers of up to 20% towards the cost of new-build properties worth up to \u00a3600,000. It will be expanded in January to make the loans available to all buyers and all types of property up to the \u00a3600,000 limit. \u2022 Bank of England governor Mark Carney had already vowed last month to curb another property bubble in the UK using a \u201ctool kit\u201d of powers. We looked at what he could actually do. \u2022 The most strident critic of the scheme was City commentator Albert Edwards who dubbed it one of the \"most stupid economic ideas\" of the past 30 years and said it was driving young people deeper into \"indentured servitude\". Those remarks and other criticisms, including from the International Monetary Fund, are summed up here Welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. We kick off today with the UK Treasury\u2019s announcement that it has asked the Bank of England carry out annual reviews of the much-criticised Help-to-Buy scheme. As yet another housing market survey shows prices picking up pace this morning, chancellor George Osborne has been trying to calm opponents who say his schemes may fuel a house price bubble. Osborne last night announced the BoE\u2019s Financial Policy Committee will publish its first review of Help to Buy next September. We will bring you more details on the Treasury\u2019s plan, some background on Help to Buy and its critics and reactions to this latest announcement. It comes against a backdrop of house prices rising for the fifth month in a row and London property hitting a fresh record, according to the latest Nationwide survey. Full details here from our reporter Rupert Jones. A quick look ahead to other key events and announcements today: \u2022 BoE governor Mark Carney has been giving interviews to regional newspapers while visiting the north of England. He told the Liverpool Echo that the Bank wants to see unemployment come down around the country and be assured an recovery has broadened out beyond the south-east. He tells the Yorkshire Post that there is a \u201cpick-up of growth\u201d in Europe and \u201cthe United States is continuing to perform well\u201d and that \u201cwithin the UK, we are probably leading the pack of the major advanced economies as we speak right now.\u201d \u2022 We will be watching events in Italy where politicial uncertainty pushed stock markets lower on Thursday \u2022 Attention in global financial markets is very much on the US as it nears a debt ceiling showdown \u2022 In Berlin, Germany\u2019s SPD party holds a meeting of leaders to decide whether to enter a coalition with Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU \u2022 Back in the UK, the government has just announced the Royal Mail is to be valued at between \u00a32.6bn and \u00a33.3bn We will bring you details on all of those as well as breaking financial news throughout the day \u2026",

    "webTitle": "Debt standoff could 'all but wipe out' US recovery, economists warn", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Washington's increasingly heated battle over raising the US debt limit could all but wipe out the country's fragile recovery, economists warned on Friday. The row over raising the government's $16.7tn borrowing limit is much more serious than the separate but politically linked tussles over the federal government's spending authority, which could trigged a government shutdown if they are not resolved by Monday. While the shutdown would rattle the economy, economists said it would be nothing compared to a failure to raise the US's debt ceiling. Treasury secretary Jack Lew warned Congress this week that unless it imminently approves an increase in the borrowing limit, the US government will be unable to meet its bills by 17 October. But Barack Obama is refusing to bow to Republican demands that he defund his landmark healthcare reforms in return for an agreement. \"Even if Congress can reach an agreement to renew the federal government's spending authority before it expires this Monday \u2013 which is looking increasingly unlikely \u2013 there's a much more serious battle brewing over the push to raise the debt ceiling before the Treasury runs out of money sometime shortly after 17 October,\" Capital Economics pair Paul Ashworth and Paul Dales wrote to clients Friday. \"We have no idea exactly how this standoff will be resolved, and even less of an idea exactly when any agreement might be reached. But, at this stage, we would be lying if we said we were confident of a positive outcome.\" The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its latest jobs report next Friday and important manufacturing data will also be released next week. In both cases, economists expect the figures to underline the strengthening US economy. But PNC bank senior macroeconomist Gus Faucher said a failure to raise the debt ceiling would \"all but wipe out\" that recovery. \"There will be an immediate drag on the economy, interest rates will rise for everyone. Social security, federal wages and contracts will not get paid. It would be disastrous,\" he said. \"The economy would basically stall.\" The chances of a shutdown appeared roughly 50-50 on Friday morning as the Senate prepared to send the budget legislation back to the House of Representatives without the controversial clause that would defund Obamacare. A vote was due on a Senate procedural measure known as cloture, which will provide a key test of Republican support for a protracted fight. In theory, Republicans have enough senators to block the cloture motion, which requires 60 votes to pass, but most GOP moderates have already declared they will not obstruct passage any further. This will allow Democrats to hold a simple majority vote on an amendment taking out the healthcare clause and stage a further vote on the revised bill later on Friday afternoon. House leaders then have until Monday night to vote in favour of the revised bill, known as a continuing resolution, or force a government shutdown by sending the it back to the Senate again with fresh demands that are unlikely to be met in time. It was still unclear on Friday morning how Republicans in the House will react, although they now have slightly more time to debate their response after a late-night deal to speed up the Senate timetable. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics and a former adviser to Republican presidential hopeful John McCain, testified in Congress this week that failure to reach an agreement would trigger \"a severe recession\". He told the joint economic committee: \"If you don't do it in time, confidence will evaporate, consumer confidence will sharply decline. Businesses will stop hiring, consumers will stop spending, the stock market will fall significantly in value, borrowing costs for businesses and households will rise.\" In a letter released by the Treasury Department on Wednesday, Lew said that on 17 October, \"Treasury would have only approximately $30bn to meet our country's commitments\". He said the sum fell far short of the $60bn the US needs on some days to meet its obligations. \"If we have insufficient cash on hand, it would be impossible for the United States of America to meet all of its obligations \u2013 for the first time in our history,\" said Lew.",

      "body": "<p>Washington's increasingly heated battle over raising the US debt limit could all but wipe out the country's fragile recovery, economists warned on Friday.</p> <p>The row over raising the government's $16.7tn borrowing limit is much more serious than the separate but politically linked tussles over the federal government's spending authority, which could trigged a government shutdown if they are not resolved by Monday.</p> <p>While the shutdown would rattle the economy, economists said it would be nothing compared to a failure to raise the US's debt ceiling.</p> <p>Treasury secretary Jack Lew warned Congress this week that unless it imminently approves an increase in the borrowing limit, the US government will be unable to meet its bills by 17 October. But Barack Obama is refusing to bow to Republican demands that he defund his landmark healthcare reforms in return for an agreement.</p> <p>\"Even if Congress can reach an agreement to renew the federal government's spending authority before it expires this Monday \u2013 which is looking increasingly unlikely \u2013 there's a much more serious battle brewing over the push to raise the debt ceiling before the Treasury runs out of money sometime shortly after 17 October,\" Capital Economics pair Paul Ashworth and Paul Dales wrote to clients Friday.</p> <p>\"We have no idea exactly how this standoff will be resolved, and even less of an idea exactly when any agreement might be reached. But, at this stage, we would be lying if we said we were confident of a positive outcome.\"</p> <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its latest jobs report next Friday and important manufacturing data will also be released next week. In both cases, economists expect the figures to underline the strengthening US economy. But PNC bank senior macroeconomist Gus Faucher said a failure to raise the debt ceiling would \"all but wipe out\" that recovery.</p> <p>\"There will be an immediate drag on the economy, interest rates will rise for everyone. Social security, federal wages and contracts will not get paid. It would be disastrous,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The economy would basically stall.\"</p> <p>The chances of a shutdown appeared roughly 50-50 on Friday morning as the Senate prepared to send the budget legislation back to the House of Representatives without the controversial clause that would defund Obamacare.</p> <p>A vote was due on a Senate procedural measure known as cloture, which will provide a key test of Republican support for a protracted fight.</p> <p>In theory, Republicans have enough senators to block the cloture motion, which requires 60 votes to pass, but most GOP moderates have already declared they will not obstruct passage any further.</p> <p>This will allow Democrats to hold a simple majority vote on an amendment taking out the healthcare clause and stage a further vote on the revised bill later on Friday afternoon.</p> <p>House leaders then have until Monday night to vote in favour of the revised bill, known as a continuing resolution, or force a government shutdown by sending the it back to the Senate again with fresh demands that are unlikely to be met in time.</p> <p>It was still unclear on Friday morning how Republicans in the House will react, although they now have slightly more time to debate their response after a late-night deal to speed up the Senate timetable.</p> <p>Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics and a former adviser to Republican presidential hopeful John McCain, testified in Congress this week that failure to reach an agreement would trigger \"a severe recession\".</p> <p>He told the joint economic committee: \"If you don't do it in time, confidence will evaporate, consumer confidence will sharply decline. Businesses will stop hiring, consumers will stop spending, the stock market will fall significantly in value, borrowing costs for businesses and households will rise.\"</p> <p>In a letter released by the Treasury Department on Wednesday, Lew said that on 17 October, \"Treasury would have only approximately $30bn to meet our country's commitments\".</p> <p>He said the sum fell far short of the $60bn the US needs on some days to meet its obligations.</p> <p>\"If we have insufficient cash on hand, it would be impossible for the United States of America to meet all of its obligations \u2013 for the first time in our history,\" said Lew.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's leading role in the development of experimental marine and tidal technology was under threat on Friday as it emerged that SSE, one of the major investors, is talking to partners about scaling back its investment in key schemes. The move follows similar ones by other major players and comes in the middle of a fractious debate about renewables and the future of the wider power market following Ed Miliband's promise to freeze energy prices and break up big power firms if Labour wins the 2015 election. The lobby group that represents wave and tidal power said the difficult regulatory environment has depressed forecasts of how much capacity could be deployed and slowed the progress of the sector. \"Without a clear route to market and a coherent plan for attaining volume in the sector, the UK risks being overtaken in this global race for our next decade's most exciting low carbon market,\" said David Krohn, wave and tidal development manager at RenewableUK. \"Wave energy is still in the early years of its story and we need perspective and patience as our industry matures.

This followed a report in trade publication ReNews that the energy firm had told project partners it intended to withdraw from 800MW of wave and tidal arrays in the waters of the Pentland Firth and off the island of Orkney. Other sources said they did not believe SSE would exit completely but the sector was very nervous following a scaling back by other big six players, RWE and E.ON. The SSE website boasts that the UK has a large marine energy resource that can uses both wave and tidal power. \"SSE aims to have several hundred megawatts of marine capacity operating or with consent by 2020 and is developing a number of options around the UK,\" it said. On Friday, SSE's shares rose for the first time in three days following City sell-offs in the aftermath of the speech by Miliband.

      "bodyText": "Having been obliged to apologise for selling a \"Psycho Ward\" Halloween fancy dress outfit, condemned for stigmatising those with mental health issues, Tesco might have been expected to scour its website for other potentially offensive items. One, however, was missed. The supermarket giant issued a second apology today/yesterday over the Inflatable Gay Best Friend, a novelty blow-up toy criticised on social media as cheaply stereotypical wuth its figure-hugging pink top and blue shorts. Adding to the concern was that Tesco's website billed the item as the Inflatable G*y Best Friend, using an asterisk in \"gay\" throughout the listing. \"An Inflatable g*y Best Friend @Tesco? What planet you on?\" read one tweet. The mystery was soon solved. Tesco explained that the item was offered via its website by another seller, which had put together the listing, complete with asterisks. It was indentified as potentially offensive and blocked before any were sold, but Tesco mistakenly did not remove the page containing the listing. A spokeswoman said: \"This product was uploaded to the website by a third-party seller but was removed from sale immediately because we found it offensive. \"The webpage should have been removed at that time and we are looking into why it is still visible two months later. We have very clear guidelines for third-party sellers who list items on our website, and are very sorry that on this occasion they weren't followed.\" The toy is listed on the website as \"ready to give you fashion advice, tell you if your bum looks big and bitch about everyone who doesn't wear Jimmy Choos\". More oddly it is described as having a \"smiling, Gary Lineker-esque face\" and supposedly aimed at children aged three and four. It was, briefly, on sale for \u00a35.99. It is still for sale on various other UK websites, including Amazon. Gay rights activists were somewhat less offended than the tweeters, being more dismissive than upset. Ben Summerskill, chief executive of Stonewall, said: \"This is like trying to sell ice to Eskimos. We can't imagine why any woman would choose to buy an inflatable gay best friend when there are two million of the real thing already available in modern Britain and most of them are much better looking than Tesco's pale imitation.\" Peter Tatchell, the veteran campaigner, said it \"panders to rather cliched, tired, stereotypes\". He added: \"I doubt that any offence was intended. It's more a case of an ill-thought-out product brainstorm. \"I haven't got a problem with the doll being advertised to three- to four-year-olds, but I wouldn't have thought they would understand the Jimmy Choo and Sex and the City references.\" On Thursday, Tesco apologised and withdrew its bright orange boilersuit-style \"Psycho Ward\" fancy dress outfit. Asda has also apologised for selling a \"mental patient fancy dress costume\", which features someone covered in blood and brandishing a machete. Other retailers have been caught out with novelty toys in the past. Last year, Liberty apologised for selling pastel-coloured wooden toy versions of the Katyusha rocket launcher, the Soviet-made weapon still used by Hezbollah to attack cities in Irsael.",

      "bodyText": "It's not quite a U-turn on the scale of the pasty tax, or any of the various other elements of the 2012 budget that were subsequently chopped; but George Osborne's decision to allow the Bank of England to carry out an annual review of his flagship Help-to-Buy scheme is a major concession. The centrepiece of this year's budget, Help to Buy was a political masterstroke, pumping up public confidence just as many potential buyers were thinking about returning to the estate agent's, and helping the government to claim credit for an upswing in the property market that had already been kicked off by the Funding for Lending Scheme. Economically, however, Help to Buy is madness, as the Treasury select committee, the International Monetary Fund and the outgoing governor of the Bank of England all lined up to say. Offering taxpayer subsidies for high loan-to-value mortgages worth up to \u00a3600,000, just as the incorrigibly boom-bust British housing market is moving from stop-to-go mode, is at best risky, at worst, downright reckless. Initially, the Treasury's argument was that the scheme would help to spark a building boom, as the surge in demand for homes prompted developers to re-start long-stalled projects. Housebuilding has picked up modestly \u2013 but by common consent it remains well below the levels that would be required to keep prices stable. Meanwhile, the body left with the hugely difficult and controversial task of pricking a future housing bubble is the new, untested financial policy committee (FPC). Before the FPC has found its feet \u2013 and the public have even noticed it exists \u2013 it is being forced to contend with a government-backed scheme deliberately aimed at bringing forward up to \u00a3130bn in new mortgage lending to risky borrowers who are not being served by the banks. Most recently, the Treasury's argument has switched from giving developers an incentive to build a rash of new homes, to fixing a specific \"market failure\" for borrowers with small deposits who are being given short shrift by lenders. But whatever the current rationale, before Friday's cave-in, Osborne's star signing Mark Carney was facing the prospect of spending the next year fielding relentless questions about whether a housing bubble is inflating, at the same time as the Treasury was pumping out taxpayer-backed loans. Even now, the FPC will only be allowed to pronounce on the scheme after 12 months; but that must be better than the pretence that subsidising homebuyers is a purely political matter, to be left to the Treasury, while forestalling a crash can be left to the number-crunching technocrats in Threadneedle Street.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government is racing to push through the \u00a33.3bn privatisation of Royal Mail before postmen and women have the chance to walkout on strike against the \"great British flog off\". Vince Cable, the business secretary, on Friday announced the coalition will sell up to 70% of the 497-year-old postal service on the stock market on 11 October. The announcement comes on the day that more than 100,000 postal workers begin voting on whether to take days of paralysing strike action. But the result of the ballot will not be known until 16 October with the earliest legal strike date not until 23 October. Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents 115,000 Royal Mail staff, said: \"The government continues to press ahead with the sale of the UK postal service despite consistent opposition from the public. \"It seems remarkable that the prospectus [for the share sale] is being issued on the same day that postal workers are being sent ballot papers for strike action. Today's announcement changes nothing in terms of the ballot which will go ahead as notified. \"Postal workers and the CWU will continue to fight to save services as well as defend their terms and conditions.\" Formally kicking off the sale, Cable said the government will sell the shares at between 260p and 330p, valuing the business at \u00a32.6bn-\u00a33.3bn. The sale could swell Treasury coffers by more than \u00a32bn. Cable said he had been \"encouraged by the interest shown by potential investors so far\", which is why the government has increased the amount of shares it may sell from at least 50% to up to 70%. \"Today is an important day in the life of Royal Mail: people can now apply to buy shares in this iconic British brand,\" Cable said. \"The sale of government shares will give others a chance to have a real stake in this important company and we are encouraged by the shown by potential investors so far.\" Cable hopes the public will buy about 30% of the shares on offer. Members of the public will be able to apply for a minimum of \u00a3750 worth of stock online, at the Post Office or through brokers until 8 October. The shares will pay a 7.7% dividend before April. Royal Mail's 150,000 employees will collect 10% of the shares \u2013 worth about \u00a32,000 each \u2013 for free as part of the flotation. Staff will also share a further \u00a313.3m \u2013 about \u00a390 each \u2013 in dividend payments in the first year, and more in following years. Staff will also have preferential access to more shares if they spend at least \u00a3500. It is the most ambitious sale of a state-owned business since the railways were privatised under John Major in the 1990s. Successive governments have tried and failed to sell Royal Mail over the past 20 decades. Margaret Thatcher, who privatised British Gas, British Airways, British Telecom and dozens of other state-owned institutions in the 1980s, refused to countenance a sale of Royal Mail, saying she was \"not prepared to have the Queen's head privatised\". Lord Heseltine and Lord Mandelson both subsequently tried but failed to sell the company, in the face of intense opposition from MPs. The sale was approved by parliament in the 2011 Postal Services Act. Hayes said 96% of Royal Mail staff opposed the sell-off, which \"not even Thatcher dared do\", despite the offer of free shares. He said postmen and women will not stand by and watch \"people in the City and the board make a killing\" from a privatisation that threatens frontline workers' pay and conditions. He added: \"This isn't about what's best for the Royal Mail, it's about vested interests of government ministers' mates in the City.\" Bankers, lawyers, accountants and PR firms are set to collect up to \u00a320m in fees from advising on the sale. Labour party members this week voted unanimously for Ed Miliband to renationalise Royal Mail if the party wins power at the next election. But shadow ministers have made it clear that they have no plans to buy back the postal service and the leadership is prepared to ignore the motion in its election manifesto. Moya Greene, chief executive of Royal Mail, said: \"Royal Mail has a unique place in the UK and that will not change as we move into the private sector. We will now be better able to compete in what is a fast changing and intensely competitive market.\" Following the sale, Royal Mail could fall into foreign hands because the government is unable to hold a \"golden share\" preventing an overseas takeover.",

      "bodyText": "It has not been a particularly good week for outsourcing group Serco. On Monday the company began life in the mid-cap index after its eviction from the FTSE 100, and now it transpires it may be investigated by the Serious Fraud Office over electronic monitoring contracts. Both Serco and rival G4S have been accused of charging the government for tagging criminals who were either in prison, never tagged at all, or dead. The Ministry of Justice has already asked the SFO to consider carrying out an investigation into G4S, and now fraud detectives have confirmed they are considering information provided by the ministry on Serco. Serco said after the market closed on Thursday it believed it had billed in accordance with the terms of the contract, and was co-operating with the ministry. It said it would not tolerate poor practice and would put it right wherever it was found. Serco's shares have dropped 8p or nearly 1.5% to 543p as investors had their first chance to react to Thursday night's statements, but analysts said the news was not unexpected. Robin Speakman at Shore Capital, in a hold note, said: Clearly to our minds, whilst this may be disappointing to investors, it is of little surprise; the SFO being in a much stronger position to review and determine the nature of evidence and actions. Serco are due to present their own internal findings on the contract (and related/ancillary issues) at the end of November. We stress, however, that this is unlikely to coincide with a resolution, in our view. We believe that investigations and the resolution process are likely to stretch into the first quarter of 2014. Meanwhile, Serco remains unable to effectively participate in the UK government contracting market, in our opinion. We remain cautious on the economic and reputational damage being inflicted on Serco - in our view a full resolution remains some months away. Oriel Securities issued a sell recommendation, saying: It looks to us as if the ministry statement is no more than confirming that the processes of SFO investigation, ministry audit of Serco and G4S and wider review by the Cabinet Office of all contracts held by Serco and G4S across government is on-going. Caroline de La Soujeole at Cantor Fitzgerald said the update did not make Serco's position materially worse, but added: If Serco fails to convince the government that it has mended its way it could be frozen from new government work. The UK public sector currently accounts for around 50% of total group sales. Given the cloud of uncertainty hanging over Serco's UK operations, we have a hold recommendation and target price of 550p.",

The very symptoms of an economic downturn \u2013 loss of jobs (and thus income tax) and a drop in the profitability of businesses (and thus company tax) make this so.</p> <p>This is the main reason for a consumption tax \u2013 even when things are tough, people still keep consuming.</p> <p>It is worth noting, however, that a consumption tax is not the great stabiliser that the above graph would have you believe. The OECD report notes that while consumption taxes did help fiscal consolidation, it came primarily through increases in the tax rates \u2013 from 2006 to 2012, 17 of the 34 OECD nations raised their consumption tax rate.</p> <p>The report also notes that \u201cone of the advantages of increasing [consumption] tax rates, has been that the measure can be implemented rather quickly\u201d. That is not the case in Australia. Yes once the tax rate is increased it can quickly flow through the economy, but the current arrangements of needing all the state and territory governments plus the federal government to sign on suggest it is not a quick fix.</p> <p>Australia does have a high company tax rate compared with other countries.

After garnering some early discussion during the election campaign when Kevin Rudd tried to scare the willies out of everyone, the issue mostly stayed out of the way. But as soon as the Western Australian government\u2019s credit rating was downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, the WA premier, Colin Barnett, called for the GST to be increased. And this week the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development released a paper, Tax Policy Landscape: Five Years after the Crisis, which showed that Australia\u2019s taxation revenue declined much more dramatically than in most OECD nations \u2013 primarily because of our high dependency on corporate and income taxes, and low dependency on consumption taxes (the GST). The report notes that corporate tax revenues \u201chave proven to be the most cyclical of major categories of tax revenue\u201d, while consumption taxes \u201cplayed a significant part in fiscal consolidation in many countries\u201d. The Business Council of Australia quickly responded to the report, suggesting it showed the need for Australia to change its tax mix from a high dependency on corporate tax to one more dependent upon consumption taxes. Now I\u2019ll pause while you recover from the shock of a business lobby group calling for lower company tax rates. But before we get too cynical about their stance, it is undeniably true that company and income taxes are hit harder by economic downturns than will consumption taxes. The very symptoms of an economic downturn \u2013 loss of jobs (and thus income tax) and a drop in the profitability of businesses (and thus company tax) make this so. This is the main reason for a consumption tax \u2013 even when things are tough, people still keep consuming. It is worth noting, however, that a consumption tax is not the great stabiliser that the above graph would have you believe. The OECD report notes that while consumption taxes did help fiscal consolidation, it came primarily through increases in the tax rates \u2013 from 2006 to 2012, 17 of the 34 OECD nations raised their consumption tax rate. The report also notes that \u201cone of the advantages of increasing [consumption] tax rates, has been that the measure can be implemented rather quickly\u201d. That is not the case in Australia. Yes once the tax rate is increased it can quickly flow through the economy, but the current arrangements of needing all the state and territory governments plus the federal government to sign on suggest it is not a quick fix. Australia does have a high company tax rate compared with other countries. Our rate of 30% has us as the ninth highest among the 34 in the OECD. But such a comparison ignores that Australia, unlike most countries, has dividend imputation on company tax. This allows shareholders receiving dividends to claim against their own tax rate. As David Richardson of the Australia Institute noted in his 2012 paper, The Case Against Cutting the Corporate Tax Rate, this \u201ceffectively means that the company income is ultimately taxed at just the individual taxpayer\u2019s marginal tax rate\u201d. And when we compare the highest marginal tax rate in the OECD, Australian lands pretty much smack in the middle. While lowering company tax is often pitched as a way to drive investment, the evidence for such a link is sketchy, especially when looking at driving investment from overseas. The Treasury's Business Tax Working Group did suggest that a lower company tax could lead to increased investment as it lowers a project\u2019s \u201churdle rate of return\u201d (ie, the after-tax profit). This in turn could lead to increased capital investment which would \u201cenhance the productivity of labour\u201d resulting in increased economic growth and incomes. That\u2019s the theory, at least. Similarly, while the evidence is quite strong that the brunt of increases in company tax falls on workers through declining wages, the evidence of lower company tax rates improving workers' wages is pretty scant. Companies are more likely to use the increase in after-tax profits from a reduced company tax rate to reinvest in the company. A look at the percentage of Australia\u2019s total factor income that went towards wages and salaries shows that after 2000 when company tax was dropped from 34% to 30%, the percentage of the income going towards wages declined. It is also worth remembering that the importance of the GST has been declining \u2013 as the consumption of items not covered by the tax has relatively increased in the past decade.
