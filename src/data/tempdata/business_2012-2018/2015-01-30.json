      "bodyText": "Tesco\u2019s new boss Dave Lewis is pulling up to a third of products off its shelves as it calls time on policy that left shoppers baffled by a choice of up to 90,000 products on their weekly shop. The struggling supermarket, which has lost market share to low-cost, low-choice retailers such as Lidl and Aldi, has called in outside consultants to cut back up to 30% of its products in an attempt to cut costs and make the weekly shop simpler. Tesco stocks up to 90,000 different products \u2013 in industry jargon, stock-keeping units or SKUs. For each big brand, every pack size and flavour is a different SKU. In air fresheners alone Tesco offers 228 different options ranging from basic own-label sprays to posher varieties that come complete with propellers or disguised as stones. With tomato ketchup, Tesco offers a bewildering array of 28 sauces while in Aldi there is just one ketchup in one size. Bryan Roberts, an analyst at the market research group Kantar Retail, said the grocery industry had been guilty of self-serving innovation as big suppliers want to grow their businesses by bringing new products to market, while buyers with financial targets to hit receive cash payments for listing new products. \u201cIf you go into Tesco you will be faced with three of four bays of air fresheners,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s painful for the shopper to navigate.\u201d According to Kantar Retail, the average household buys only 400 products a year, with just 41 items in their weekly shop. Lewis, Tesco\u2019s new chief executive, announced the shake-up as part of a complete overhaul of the supermarket, which is also struggling to emerge from the shadow of last year\u2019s accounting scandal. By stocking fewer products it will be able to cut prices, make shopping easier and improve availability on its shelves. Tesco has drafted in management consultants from the Boston Consulting Group to decide which products will have to go. They are expected to reduce the number of lines it stocks to between 65,000 and 70,000, looking at every product from aluminium foil - where Tesco offers 13 different varieties, while Aldi has two and Lidl only one - to white bread, where Tesco has 50 different loaves on its shelves to Aldi\u2019s seven. Aldi and Lidl are described as limited-range discounters because they stock fewer than 2,000 products. That dramatically far smaller number gives them a lot of buying power and makes the business much simpler to run \u2013 meaning prices can be more competitive. \u201cRanges in superstores are a real point of difference versus the discounters who, with their smaller assortment, are able to drive down prices and offer a speedy shopping experience,\u201d said Steve Dresser of the retail consultancy Grocery Insight. \u201cA customer likes to look at one tomato ketchup and know it\u2019s of sufficient quality, a good price, and then purchase it. This is where the discounters have gained traction and, crucially in food retail, momentum.\u201d Wide ranges help the big grocer because they can demand payments from suppliers to put their products on their shelves. Over the past two years, as Tesco has come under increasing pressure, its range has mushroomed by a third. Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s, which have not expanded in the same way, stock 20,000 to 30,000 lines. Lewis has the job of leading one of the biggest turnarounds in retail after a collapse in sales that left the major UK chain barely turning a profit. This week Tesco confirmed plans to close 43 loss-making stores, putting 2,000 jobs at risk. Several thousand jobs are going as a result of Lewis closing its Cheshunt head office as he tries to cut running costs by \u00a3250m a year. Dresser said stocking fewer products is another way of saving money. \u201cHaving less items also makes it easier for staff to fill up the shelves and they are less likely to have to fill up during the day, which is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople do want choice but there has to be a happy medium. Tesco is miles ahead of the pack [in terms of SKUs].\u201d But slashing the ranges could leave Tesco with a new problem \u2013 too much shelf space. Its biggest stores are already a drag on the business as shoppers have switched to doing more frequent shops at smaller local shops. According to the industry bible the Grocer, the unwanted products will be swept off the shelves in one go, possibly at the end of summer, giving Tesco stores a dramatic new look. It could also cause big problems for smaller suppliers with specialist products. A spokesperson for Tesco said: \u201cThe review is ongoing and no changes have yet been set.\u201d Supermarket choice Air freshener Tesco 224 options, from Tesco gel air freshener to Glade sense &amp; spray relaxing zen. Aldi 12 options, all own brand Rice Tesco 98 options, from Tilda steamed wholegrain basmati to Yutaka sushi rice. Aldi six options, all own brand.

    "webTitle": "Eurozone deflation deepens in January", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fresh fears have been raised about the economic outlook after the US economy lost momentum at the end of last year and the eurozone descended deeper into deflation. Figures from the European statistics office, suggesting that prices fell 0.6% in January on the previous year, the biggest drop since the depths of recession in 2009, prompted warnings that radical action by the European Central Bank may have come too late to shore up the eurozone\u2019s flagging recovery. Meanwhile in the US, growth slowed sharply in the final quarter as weak business spending and a growing trade deficit offset strong consumer spending. GDP rose an annual 2.6%, almost half the 5% rate of the third quarter. Economists had expected that growth in the world\u2019s biggest economy would slow in the final three months of the year, but not so sharply, with the consensus forecast for 3% expansion. The GDP figures combined with worries about the eurozone to push shares down on Wall Street. \u201cThe slowdown was bigger than expected and feeds into fears that a strong dollar, an international slowdown and slowing investment in the US oil industry will take a toll on US growth,\u201d said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK. Economists also noted pressures on the US and wider global economy from worries about the stability of the eurozone, a key trading bloc, after Greek anti-austerity party Syriza took power in the country that first sparked the eurozone debt crisis. \u201cEscalating tensions with Russia and the potential for another flare-up of the euro area debt crisis following the anti-austerity Syriza party\u2019s success in the Greek elections remain key risks to the global economic outlook,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at the data company Markit, which publishes surveys on economies around the world. But he highlighted that consumer confidence remained strong in the US and that in Europe there was also a potential boost for business and consumer confidence from the ECB\u2019s announcement that it is to begin pumping \u20ac1.1tn of extra money into the economy through quantitative easing (QE). The bank\u2019s chief, Mario Draghi, has said he will begin the money-printing programme in March in a move to tackle deflation and prevent the fragile eurozone economy from grinding to a halt as slumping prices encourage businesses and consumers to put off spending. The move appeared to be vindicated on Friday by news that deflation was sharper than expected in January, driven in part by a slump in oil prices. The 0.6% annual drop in consumer prices across the single currency bloc matched a record fall set in July 2009. It follows annual deflation of 0.2% in December and was worse than the forecast of a 0.5% fall in a Reuters poll of economists. Even core inflation, which strips out the effect of falling oil prices, weakened further in January, fuelling fears that the ECB\u2019s bond-buying programme may not be enough to stave off a downward spiral in prices. The figures, an early \u201cflash\u201d estimate from the European statistics office, showed core inflation, which excludes the effect of volatile items such as food, alcohol and tobacco, edging down to 0.5% this month from 0.7% in December. \u201cToday\u2019s inflation numbers fully vindicate the ECB\u2019s decision to embark on QE. That said, QE will not raise inflation in the coming months. Unless oil prices stage a quick recovery, the energy component will keep headline inflation well below zero in the months ahead. But the key number to watch in the coming months is core inflation. Any further falls may raise concerns that QE has come too late to stave off deflation,\u201d said Teunis Brosens at ING Financial Markets. The ECB aims to keep inflation at just under 2% and Draghi has said the money-printing programme would continue \u201cuntil we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation\u201d. Separate numbers showed a marginal improvement in the eurozone labour market in December, with unemployment edging down to 11.4%, defying economists\u2019 expectations for it to hold at November\u2019s 11.5% rate. It was the lowest since August 2012. Timo del Carpio, European economist at RBC Capital Markets, said the unexpected drop in unemployment \u201cserves to tentatively end a period of stagnation that had persisted for the latter half of 2014\u201d. But he also highlighted that much of the improvement reflected a sharp drop in typically volatile Italian data. \u201cMoreover, while survey indicators of hiring intentions have been improving, they still point to only tepid job creation over the first half of 2015,\u201d he added. The statistics office, Eurostat, said unemployment was lowest in Germany (4.8%) and Austria (4.9%), and highest in Greece (25.8% in the most recently available figures, from October 2014) and Spain (23.7%). \u2022 This article has been amended after a correction to official figures was issued by Eurostat. Estimated core inflation \u2013 the rate excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco \u2013 was 0.6% in January, not 0.5%, as previously stated.",

Economists had expected that growth in the world\u2019s biggest economy would slow in the final three months of the year, but not so sharply, with the consensus forecast for 3% expansion.</p> <p>The GDP figures combined with worries about the eurozone to push shares down on Wall Street.</p> <p>\u201cThe slowdown was bigger than expected and feeds into fears that a strong dollar, an international slowdown and slowing investment in the US oil industry will take a toll on US growth,\u201d said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK.</p> <p>Economists also noted pressures on the US and wider global economy from worries about the stability of the eurozone, a key trading bloc, after Greek anti-austerity party Syriza took power in the country that first sparked the eurozone debt crisis.</p> <p>\u201cEscalating tensions with Russia and the potential for another flare-up of the euro area debt crisis following the anti-austerity Syriza party\u2019s success in the Greek elections remain key risks to the global economic outlook,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at the data company Markit, which publishes surveys on economies around the world.</p> <p>But he highlighted that consumer confidence remained strong in the US and that in Europe there was also a potential boost for business and consumer confidence from the ECB\u2019s announcement that it is to begin pumping \u20ac1.1tn of extra money into the economy through quantitative easing (QE).</p> <p>The bank\u2019s chief, Mario Draghi, has said he will begin the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/22/ecb-unveils-1-trillion-qe-plan-stimulate-eurozoen-economy\" title=\"\">money-printing programme</a> in March in a move to tackle deflation and prevent the fragile eurozone economy from grinding to a halt as slumping prices encourage businesses and consumers to put off spending.</p> <p>The move appeared to be vindicated on Friday by news that deflation was sharper than expected in January, driven in part by a slump in oil prices. The 0.6% annual drop in consumer prices across the single currency bloc matched a record fall set in July 2009. It follows annual deflation of 0.2% in December and was worse than the forecast of a 0.5% fall in a Reuters poll of economists.</p> <p>Even core inflation, which strips out the effect of falling oil prices, weakened further in January, fuelling fears that the ECB\u2019s bond-buying programme may not be enough to stave off a downward spiral in prices.</p> <p>The figures, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-press-releases/-/2-30012015-BP\" title=\"\">an early \u201cflash\u201d estimate</a> from the European statistics office, showed core inflation, which excludes the effect of volatile items such as food, alcohol and tobacco, edging down to 0.5% this month from 0.7% in December.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Eurozone deflation\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1422616954284/EuroZone_Deflation.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Eurozone deflation</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cToday\u2019s inflation numbers fully vindicate the ECB\u2019s decision to embark on QE.

      "bodyText": "Time for a round up of the day\u2019s events. The meeting between Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and eurogroup finance chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem ended in a tense press conference (coverage of the conference starts from here). Varoufakis rejected any extension to the country\u2019s bailout and refused to co-operate with the troika of lenders (the ECB, EU and IMF). Dijsselbloem criticised \u201cunilateral\u201d moves and said a decision on Greece\u2019s 28 February deadline with its lenders would be reached before then. Helena Smith was at the press conference and reports: The battle lines between Greece and its creditors were drawn in Athens as the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis announced that the new government would refuse to engage with officials representing the country\u2019s hated \u201ctroika\u201d of lenders. Standing his ground after talks in the capital with the euro group chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the finance minister said Greece would not be pursuing further discourse \u201cwith that committee.\u201d Nor would it be rowing back on the promises that had got it into power by asking for an extension to its \u20ac240bn bailout programme. \u201cThis platform enabled us to win the confidence of the Greek people,\u201d Varoufakis told a press conference, insisting that the \u201clogic\u201d of austerity had been repudiated by voters when the far left Syriza party stormed to victory in Sunday\u2019s election. Meanwhile German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Germany was open for talks with the new Greek government but would not be blackmailed. Which drew a predictable response from a Greek government spokesman. The tensions between Greece and the rest of the eurozone sent the Athens market lower again and hit shorter dated Greek bonds. Elsewhere Russia cut interest rates unexpectedly while US GDP figures showed the recovery slowing in the fourth quarter. Earlier came news that the eurozone had fallen further into deflation in January, with prices falling 0.6%, the fastest pace for more than five years. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Have a good weekend. To Potami, the fledgling party which finished in fourth place in the elections with 6.1%, seems unhappy with the day\u2019s events: The role of British universities in the rise to power of Syriza is examined in a report by my colleagues Ben Quinn and Aisha Gani. Here\u2019s a flavour: It could easily have been a scene from one of this week\u2019s post-election victory rallies in Greece, as supporters of the victorious Syriza party cheered, surrounded by posters and banners. Yet the setting was not Athens but central London, where hundreds of the party\u2019s UK branch gathered at the TUC\u2019s headquarters on Wednesday to celebrate Syriza\u2019s election victory alongside peers from the British left and other Europeans energised by Syriza\u2019s feat. A lesser known story of Syriza\u2019s rise, however, has been the role played by a sizeable number of Greek intellectuals based now or previously at British universities \u2013 some of whom have been catapulted from academia to senior positions of power in Greece\u2019s new government. The full piece is here: How British universities helped mould Syriza\u2019s political elite And here\u2019s a short video by Ben of the Syriza victory rally in London. Greek bonds have been hit by the tensions between the country and its lenders, with three year yields soaring to 19% before easing to close at 18.77%. The five year bond jumped form 13.58% on Thursday to 14.9%. The Athens market has closed down 1.59% at 721.93. It has been down most of the day but took another lurch lower during the press conference between the eurogroup\u2019s Jeroen Dijsselbloem and new Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, as the tensions between the two sides were laid bare. A late attempt at a recovery could not prevent another negative day. Heading into the close for the Athens market, and it is now down around 1.86%, lower than before the meeting between Dijsselbloem and Varoufakis. Here\u2019s the Reuters report on the meeting between Dijsselbloem and Varoufakis: Greece\u2019s government will not cooperate with the EU and IMF mission bankrolling the country and will not seek an extension to the bailout programme, its finance minister said on Friday. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the eurozone finance ministers\u2019 group who is in Athens for talks with the new government, said the two sides would decide what would happen next before the programme ends on February 28. \u201cThis platform enabled us to win the confidence of the Greek people,\u201d Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis told reporters after their meeting. \u201cOur first action as a government will not be to reject the rationale of questioning this programme through a request to extend it.\u201d Varoufakis said he had assured Dijsselbloem that Athens planned to implement reforms to make the economy more competitive and have balanced budgets but that it would not accept a \u201cself-fed crisis\u201d of deflation and non-viable debt. In turn, Dijsselbloem said he had told the new government to respect the terms of the existing agreement between Greece and the eurozone and warned against taking unilateral steps, saying it was important not to reverse progress made so far. He said continuing support from Europe depended on Greece respecting its obligations and it was up to to Athens to decide its position before moving forward jointly with the eurozone. Back to the press conference between eurogroup finance head Jeroen Dijsselbloem and Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, and Helena Smith says it was a tense affair: Send off for Joren Dijsselbloem ended with incredible stand-off as Varoufakis socked him one over the troika. The Dutchman looked enraged, bending forward to whisper something in Varoufakis\u2019 ear to which the Greek finance minister did not respond. Greek finance ministry staff standing behind me said \u201cOh my God.\u201d One said \u201cI wonder if this is the time to pack my bags.\u201d Throughout the press conference you could almost feel the electric tension in the air. Meanwhile there has been reaction to the comments earlier from German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble who said Germany was open for talks with the new Greek government \u2013 but would not be blackmailed. Reuters again: The positions of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and his team are well known, Greek government spokesman Gavriil Sakellaridis said in an announcement issued on Friday. \u201cAlso known throughout the world now is the Greek people\u2019s verdict for an exit from the mire of toxic austerity. The Greek government will continue consultations to find a mutually beneficial solution. The real negotiation has begun and it does not concern only Greece or Germany, it concerns the European Union as a whole,\u201d he said. Here\u2019s Reuters key points from the press conference: Eurogroup head: Greece taking unilateral steps is not the way forward Dijsselbloem says up to Greek govt to determine position Then we can move forward jointly Agreed programme has been extended Will decide before programme ends in Feb what will happen next Greek FinMin: We don\u2019t have plans to cooperate with Troika mission The Greek bank index has now turned negative, down 1.2% following the press conference, reports Reuters. The seeming standoff between Greece and the rest of the EU - no talks with the troika versus unilateralism is not the way and progress made must not be lost - is hitting Greek bonds. And that appears to be that. Varoufakis confirms this standpoint by saying we don\u2019t have any plans to co-operate with the troika mission. Would you accept the troika as interlocutor? (the new Greek government is reluctant to deal with the creditor representatives of the EU, ECB and IMF). Their statements have been made, reports Helena, and they are taking two questions only. He says it is up to the Greek government to determine its position, then we can move jointly forward. Dijsselbloem says we want Greece to regain economic independence, it is important not to lose the progress made these years in Greece (quote from Reuters). Varoufakis says: We have just had get to know you talks that I am sure will form a productive and effective for the interests of Greece and the eurozone. I impressed upon him our determination to forge ahead with reforms without fear or passions, reforms that have been needed for years. The press conference between eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem and Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is underway. Slight delay while Dijsselbloem sorts out translation problems, says Helena Smith who is there. Varoufakis offers to translate. She says the eurogroup head looked annoyed when he walked in while Varoufakis looked upbeat. European markets are down. Investors are weighing up weaker-than-expected US GDP and deeper eurozone deflation, and await the outcome of talks between the Greek finance minister and Eurogroup chief. FTSE 100: -0.4% at 6,782.35 France\u2019s CAC: -0.8% at 4,595.74 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.6% at 10,669.93 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.6% at 10,444.2 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.6% at 20,474.47 Greece\u2019s ATG: -1.3% at 723.93 Cheese sandwich anyone? Croissant? Paul Ashworth, chief US economist, at Capital Economics, says the slowing US economy in the fourth quarter is nothing to worry about. The 2.6% annualised gain in fourth-quarter GDP was slightly below the 3% consensus forecast but, following the breakneck 5% gain in the third quarter of last year, this slowdown is nothing to worry about. The fourth-quarter gain was driven by a very strong 4.3% annualised increase in consumption. With the collapse in energy prices increasing households\u2019 purchasing power, we expect strong consumption growth to continue driving GDP growth in the first half of this year. We expect GDP growth for 2015 as a whole to be 3%. The US economy grew at an annual rate of 2.6% between October and December, following growth of 5% in the third quarter. That was below expectations of a 3% increase in gross domestic product. The US commerce department said a drop in government spending and business investment was a drag on growth, while consumer spending - which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy - increased by 4.3%. Dijsselbloem has also been posing for the cameras in Athens with the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. Still looking cheery. The press conference is scheduled to begin at 14.30 UK time. The first pictures of the meeting between the eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem and Greek PM Alexis Tsipras have emerged on Greek television. They\u2019re looking fairly cheerful in front of the cameras. Russia has taken markets by surprise, cutting interest rates a month after raising them. The central bank cut the main rate by two points to 15% as fears of a deep recession mount following the oil price slump and western sanctions over Ukraine. A little over a month ago, the bank pushed rates up 6.5 points to 17% after a run on the rouble. Back in Greece... Meanwhile, the German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said Germany is open for talks with the new Greek government \u2013 but won\u2019t be blackmailed. He also said the Greek government knows it has to take action quickly. Noting that Europe had already pushed its generosity to Greece to the absolute limit, Sch\u00e4uble told representatives of the insurance industry in a speech in Berlin: We need solidarity in Europe, and besides we cannot be blackmailed. He said Germany is ready to talk with Greece about its debt problems but the basis for these discussions cannot be changed. He added that agreements in Europe only make sense if they can be relied on. And we\u2019re off. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the eurozone finance chief, has arrived in Athens for talks with the new Greek government. From Athens, the Guardian\u2019s Helena Smith says the eurogroup president is expected to be with prime minister Alexis Tsipras for no more than 30 minutes. After that he moves onto talks with the new finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. Read our full story on eurozone deflation here. The eurozone descended further into deflation in January, with prices falling 0.6%, the fastest pace for more than five years amid tumbling global oil prices. The annual drop in prices across the single currency bloc was bigger than economists had been expecting and matched a record fall set when the eurozone was mired in recession in July 2009. The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, is in China and trying to ease concerns there about a potential Greek exit from the eurozone. Greece will remain, must remain in the eurozone. The new Greek prime minister has said, it cannot be any other way. We must help Greece out of the crisis she faces. But at the same time Greece must respect its commitments, that is how the European Union works. Pushing for greater trade links between China and Europe/France, he told a Chinese business audience: I know there are some concerns that relate to the situation of the eurozone or Europe , which remains a major trading partner. Discussions are constantly taking place between China and the European Union, so come and invest in Europe, and in France in particular. The poker game approach over the Greek debt deal continues between Germany and Greece. A spokesman for the German finance ministry has said an extension of Greece\u2019s bailout programme only makes sense if Greece wants to implement reforms. Speaking at a German government press conference, Martin Jaeger, said: The reality is simple - at the end of February an aid programme expires which in order to have an orderly ending, needs extra efforts by Greece. If some of the new measures announced by the new Greek government are put into practice, then we need to ask if the programme is being substantially put into question. We are prepared to work further with Greece. But we will not force our help onto Athens. Announcements so far from Athens appear to go in the other direction [away from reforms]. Now back to Greece, where finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has arrived on a 1300 CC Yamaha bike for a meeting with his boss, PM Alexis Tsipras. No picture sadly, but Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Athens, brings us this report: Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has again turned heads arriving for talks with the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras on a giant 1300 CC Yamaha bike. The two men are conferring ahead of their meeting with Euro group president Jeroen Dijsselbloem. If any proof were needed that Greece has entered a new era, this was it. Its far removed from anything Greeks have seen to date and reconfirms the growing suspicion that Yanis Varoufakis is the coolest politician the country now has. Yesterday, as he arrived for his first day behind his desk at the finance ministry, he was mobbed by breathless mobile camera wielding schoolgirls. Some good news from Spain, where economic recovery accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2014. The economy grew by 0.7% between October and December, following growth of 0.5% in the third quarter. Economists polled by Reuters were forecasting a smaller rise, at 0.6%. Reaction to this morning\u2019s eurozone data on inflation is coming in. The region sank deeper into deflation in January with an annual inflation at -0.6%. Christian Schulz, senior economist at German bank Berenberg: Eurozone prices made the expected deep dive into deflationary territory in January. The sharp fall in inflation poses a risk to inflation expectations, which had already been under pressure due to the huge amount of slack in the economy and the slow pace of the recovery. The ECB was thus more than justified in taking aggressive action earlier this month. The multi-stimulus of cheap oil, a weak euro and aggressive monetary easing is now stabilising expectations and will help the ECB reach its price stability target over time. However, to fully benefit from the ECB\u2019s stimulus, countries need to their structural reform homework. Teunis Brosens, economist at ING: Today\u2019s inflation report provides strong justification for the ECB\u2019s recent decision to embrace QE. Lower oil prices pushed headline Eurozone inflation further into negative territory. At the same time, core inflation fell to an all-time low. Today\u2019s inflation numbers fully vindicate the ECB\u2019s decision to embark on QE. That said, QE will not raise inflation in the coming months. Unless oil prices stage a quick recovery, the energy component will keep headline inflation well below zero in the months ahead. But the key number to watch in the coming months is core inflation. Any further falls may raise concerns that QE has come too late to stave off deflation. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics: January\u2019s eurozone consumer prices figures have brought further evidence that deflationary pressures in the currency union go well beyond the effect of falling energy prices. The key news here is that core inflation \u2013 which excludes both energy and food prices \u2013 fell from +0.7% to +0.5%, a new record low. The drop in core inflation almost certainly reflects the continued weakness of demand in the euro-zone economy, and the associated vast amount of spare capacity. With growth likely to remain too weak to erode spare capacity to any significant degree, core inflation could continue to drop, raising the risk that deflation persists even after downward energy effects begin to fade. The eurozone unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to 11.4% in December from 11.5% in November. It was the lowest in more than two years, since August 2012. Economists were expecting no change to the rate as the region continues to struggle with a sluggish economy and high levels of debt in some countries. Large disparities between countries remain. The highest rates are in Greece at 25.8% (October figure) and Spain at 23.7%. The lowest rates are in Germany, at 4.8%, and Austria, at 4.9%. The number of unemployed people in the eurozone was 18.1m in December. Youth unemployment also fell slightly but remains high, with a jobless rate of 23% in December, compared with 23.2% in November. There were 3.29m people under the age of 25 out of work in the eurozone in December. Eurozone inflation of -0.6% in January was lower than economists were predicting (-0.5%) and throws further weight behind the European Central Bank\u2019s decision last week to announce a \u20ac1.1tn programme of quantitative easing. The big drag on prices was energy, down 8.9%, but food, alcohol and tobacco prices were also down by 0.1%. Core inflation, stripping out energy, food and tobacco, fell to 0.5% from 0.7% in December. Breaking: Eurozone inflation falls to -0.6 in January, from -0.2% in December. The US will co-operate closely with the Greece, according to a White House spokesman quoted by Reuters. Josh Earnest, assistant to the President and White House Press Secretary: We will continue to work closely with the Greek leaders and the Greek people to implement policies that are in the interest of the country and the interests of the wider European and global economy. Earnest said there was no announcement to make on the possibility of the Greek PM visiting the US to meet President Obama in the near future. But he did give some (limited) insight into the details of a telephone conversation between Tsipras and Obama. The President made clear that we will continue to co-operate closely with the Greek leaders and the Greek people aiming at implementing policies that are in the interest of the country, and the interest of the wider European and global economy. Away from Greece, the flash estimate for eurozone inflation for January will be published at 10am UK time. Economists are forecasting prices fell at a faster pace in January, with annual inflation of -0.5% compared with -0.2% in December. If correct, the deeper fall into deflation will appear to further justify the European Central Bank\u2019s decision last week to finally push the button on sovereign bond buying (quantitative easing). We shall see. Unemployment data published also published at 10am is expected to show the eurozone jobless rate was flat in December at 11.5% (but with huge country variations as ever). We will bring you the data and reaction as it happens. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has waded into the debate over whether Greece is delaying agreement on imposing further EU sanctions on Russia over Ukraine. Muddying the water further, Varoufakis claims Greece has not been consulted on fresh sanctions, so any comments made on the subject do not amount to a Greek veto. Writing his own personal blog, entitled A question of respect (or lack thereof)\u2026 \u2013 the Greek veto over Russia that never was , he said: On the first day in our ministries, the power of the media to distort hit me again. The world\u2019s press was full of reports on how the Syriza government\u2019s first foreign policy \u2018move\u2019 was to veto fresh sanctions on Russia. Now, I am not qualified to speak on foreign affairs but, nonetheless, I must share this with you at a personal level. Our Foreign Minister, Nikos Kotzias, briefed us that on his first day at the job he heard in the news bulletins that the EU had approved new sanctions on Russia unanimously. The problem was that he, and the new Greek government, were never asked! So, clearly, the issue was not whether our new government agrees or not with fresh sanctions on Russia. The issue is whether our view can be taken for granted without even being told of what it is! From my perspective, even though (let me state it again) I am certainly not qualified to speak on foreign affairs, this is all about a question of respect for our national sovereignty. Could journalists the world over try to draw this important distinction between protesting our being neglected from protesting the sanctions themselves? Or is this too complicated? The Greek government should be readying itself for some tense discussions with Jeroen Dijsselbloem, eurozone finance chief, this afternoon. Speaking in Amsterdam before he left for Athens, Dijsselbloem suggested it would be impossible for Tsipras and Syriza - his radical left party - to stick to all their pre-election promises. In all honesty, if you add up all the promises, then the Greek budget will very quickly run totally off course. Greek shares are also up slightly, with the ATG index up 1.1% at 741.58. Banking shares are up sharply, adding to the 12.9% rebound on Thursday following heavy losses earlier this week. European shares have opened slightly higher this morning, following a late rally on Wall Street last night. FTSE 100: +0.03% at 6812.56 France\u2019s CAC: +0.6% at 4657.2 German DAX: +0.5% at 10787.2 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.5% at 10,564 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.1% at 20,610.59 Just as Greece is trying to win friends and influence people, it appears to be ruffling a few feathers in Europe over Russian sanctions. Reports last night suggested the Greek government was picking its first fight with the EU by delaying agreement on further sanctions against Russia. Nikos Kotzias, the new Greek foreign minister, said Greece wanted to \u201cprevent a rift\u201d between Russia and the EU. He later added: \u201cWe are not against every sanction. We are in the mainstream, we are not the bad boys.\u201d The development is likely to stoke fears that Russia will seek to capitalise on potential divisions between Greece\u2019s new anti-austerity coalition government and the rest of Europe. Martin Schulz, president of the European parliament, is not happy. Fresh from his meeting with Greek PM Tsipras on Thursday, he said Greece should not undermine EU policy on Russia at a time when it is seeking support from its partners over its own situation. Schulz told Kathimerini newspaper: I was surprised by the statements that were made and the fact that the Greek government looked ready to abandon the common EU line on Russia . It is difficult on the one hand to expect a revised common approach to one\u2019s country, and on the other to be differentiating from the others, particularly as the first move after taking office. Ouch. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek election, and other key developments across the financial markets, the world economy, the rest of the eurozone, and business. The main event of the day in Athens should be the meeting between the Greek PM Alexis Tsipras, his finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, and Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the eurozone group of finance ministers. This is where the negotiations over Greece\u2019s future begin. The two sides will hope to find some common ground, but Tsipras and his anti-austerity cabinet have already proved they mean to carry out their pre-election promises, reversing public sector job cuts and planned privatisations. The meeting is scheduled for 16.30 in Athens (14.30 UK time). We will have live updates here. It will kickstart a round of talks between Varoufakis and his counterparts across Europe, as Greece tries to build support for a renegotiation of its debt deal and the terms of its bailout programme. On Sunday, Varoufakis will travel to London to meet the chancellor, George Osborne, before heading to France, Spain and Italy to meet finance ministers there.",

The multi-stimulus of cheap oil, a weak euro and aggressive monetary easing is now stabilising expectations and will help the ECB reach its price stability target over time. However, to fully benefit from the ECB\u2019s stimulus, countries need to their structural reform homework.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Teunis Brosens</strong>, economist at <strong>ING</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s inflation report provides strong justification for the ECB\u2019s recent decision to embrace QE. Lower oil prices pushed headline Eurozone inflation further into negative territory. At the same time, core inflation fell to an all-time low.</p> <p>Today\u2019s inflation numbers fully vindicate the ECB\u2019s decision to embark on QE. That said, QE will not raise inflation in the coming months. Unless oil prices stage a quick recovery, the energy component will keep headline inflation well below zero in the months ahead. </p> <p>But the key number to watch in the coming months is core inflation. Any further falls may raise concerns that QE has come too late to stave off deflation. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jonathan Loynes, </strong>chief European economist at <strong>Capital Economics</strong>:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> January\u2019s eurozone consumer prices figures have brought further evidence that deflationary pressures in the currency union go well beyond the effect of falling energy prices.<br></p> <p>The key news here is that core inflation \u2013 which excludes both energy and food prices \u2013 fell from +0.7% to +0.5%, a new record low. </p> <p>The drop in core inflation almost certainly reflects the continued weakness of demand in the euro-zone economy, and the associated vast amount of spare capacity.</p> <p>With growth likely to remain too weak to erode spare capacity to any significant degree, core inflation could continue to drop, raising the risk that deflation persists even after downward energy effects begin to fade.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54cb59e8e4b020c57748fd69\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-01-30T10:33:33.949Z\">10.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone unemployment dips unexpectedly to two-year low</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The eurozone unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to 11.4% in December from 11.5% in November. </strong>It was the lowest in more than two years, since August 2012.</p> <p>Economists were expecting no change to the rate as the region continues to struggle with a sluggish economy and high levels of debt in some countries.</p> <p>Large disparities between countries remain.

      "bodyText": "A senior Conservative politician has raised concerns about the brutal employment environment for retail workers on zero-hour contracts as he shuts his 123-year-old family department store. Sir John Randall, who served as deputy chief whip under the coalition, will close the eponymous Randalls of Uxbridge store on Saturday in a move he described as \u201clike a bereavement\u201d. In an interview with the Guardian, Randall said his main concern is for his staff, some of whom have worked in the department shop for decades, and are now entering \u201ca very brutal world out there\u201d. He said the closure of the store could be blamed on online shopping, lower footfall and pressure on margins from bigger rivals lowering costs by employing people on zero-hour contracts \u2013 which offer no fixed hours or income and account for 1.4m employee contracts in the UK. Randall said he would never consider using such employment practices himself, and at one point, he shut the shop for an extra day a week rather than make redundancies. He has now spoken out about this in the House of Commons, telling MPs that having witnessed the experiences of those looking for work elsewhere, he is \u201cshocked at how the retail world has changed\u201d. \u201cThe sort of employment being offered now, including zero-hours contracts, makes it quite scary for people going into the retail business,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of us, as consumers, have to take some blame for that, because it is consumer pressure that leads to margins being cut and everybody looking at how they can do that, and I am afraid that employment is one of the affected areas. Although I can blame online services and lots of other things, we all have to take responsibility for that.\u201d The Conservative MP, who worked on the shop floor of Randalls as a young man, like his father, a cabinet maker, said he would not want any of his three children to enter the retail industry. \u201cI\u2019ve got two boys and a daughter. None of them want to go into it and I wouldn\u2019t want them to because it is so pressured,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has brought more sleepless nights than parliament ever has \u2013 even during expenses or [voting against the] Iraq War and I didn\u2019t sleep too well leading up to that. But this is what causes me waking up in the middle of the night, worrying about the staff.\u201d Many senior Conservatives, including work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, have defended zero-hour contracts as a flexible way of working that is appreciated both by employers and some workers. However, they have been strongly criticised by trade unions and some Labour politicians. Randall stopped short of saying the contracts should banned but suggested consumers should be more aware of the consequences of purchasing cheap goods from big retailers. \u201cInsisting on lower and lower prices all the time is not only knocking out manufacturing jobs but it\u2019s also making life very difficult for people in retail. I\u2019ve often said I could almost have been a shop steward for Usdaw because I think shop staff get a very raw deal. My staff are certainly realising the grass is not greener on the other side,\u201d he said. His department store, which has a Grade II listed art deco exterior, appears little changed since the middle of the last century inside and has been the location for television series such as Only Fools and Horses. Randall said he had hoped he might be able to save the shop as he is stepping down from parliament in May this year. However, he came to the decision just before Christmas that the shop, where five generations of his family have worked, would have to shut. It will close its doors after a final sale period on Saturday . \u201cIt\u2019s very close to my heart,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout being rotten about parliament, I\u2019ll be sorry to go but in many respects not half as sorry as closing this. I\u2019ve described it as a bereavement. It\u2019s rather like an elderly relation who is effectively on a life support machine and I know the end is coming for some time and I\u2019ve now been asked to take the decision to switch it off. Not an easy decision but it\u2019s got to be done.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Qatar Airways has bought a 10% stake in the parent company of British Airways in the latest UK investment by the Gulf state. The move will cement a close commercial relationship between BA and the airline, whose owner, the Qatari government, is a significant investor in Britain. The state\u2019s investment fund owns Harrods, the Shard skyscraper in central London and stakes in Sainsbury\u2019s, Barclays bank and Heathrow. The airline\u2019s chief executive officer, Akbar Al Baker, already sits on the board of Heathrow where Qatar owns a 20% stake. Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, the BA owner, said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to have Qatar Airways, one of the world\u2019s premier airlines, as a long-term supportive shareholder. We will talk to them about what opportunities exist to work more closely together and further IAG\u2019s ambitions as the leading global airline group.\u201d However, BA\u2019s biggest trade union said Qatar Airways\u2019 employment practices, which forbid female staff to marry and allow the termination of contracts for pregnancy, were a cause for alarm. \u201cQatar Airways\u2019 treatment of its workforce is cause for serious concern, and is currently subject to a formal complaint to the UN\u2019s international labour organisation. Given the union-initiated progressive work that has taken place at BA to eliminate a number of discriminatory practices, this is an opportunity for IAG to impress upon Qatar the benefits of such an approach.\u201d The International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation has documented a range of other breaches of rights at the airline, including curfews, surveillance and summary dismissals leading to expulsion from the Gulf. Executives at Barcelona football club, which is sponsored by Qatar Airways, this week said they would be reviewing the deal owing to social conditions in Qatar. Qatar Airways has described the ITF allegations as inaccurate. A spokesman told the Guardian in a previous response to the claims: \u201cOur contracts are transparent and reflect important safety standards in the aviation industry, and local regulations, and are not dissimilar to other airlines or private-sector companies operating both in the Middle East and beyond.\u201d BA sponsored Qatar\u2019s entry into the Oneworld airline alliance, and they also have a cargo partnership. Qatar has indicated it would seek to extend ties following the investment, which could include codeshares on flights via the Gulf state \u2013 allowing the airlines to sell tickets on each other\u2019s planes. Baker said: \u201cIAG represents an excellent opportunity to further develop our westwards strategy.\u201d Qatar Airways is prohibited from owning more than a minority stake in IAG under EU ownership rules and said it does not currently intend to increase its 9.99% shareholding. IAG was formed by the merger of BA and Iberia in 2011 and has since acquired the Spanish low-cost carrier Vueling. It is pursuing the acquisition of Irish carrier Aer Lingus, whose shareholders include Abu Dhabi-based airline Etihad. What the Qataris own in Britain \u2022 HSBC Tower, the bank\u2019s global headquarters in Canary Wharf \u2022 The Shard on the south bank of the Thames (95%) \u2022 Harrods, bought in 2010 for a reported \u00a31.5bn \u2022 The Olympic Village in east London \u2022 Numbers 1-3 Cornwall Terrace, Regent\u2019s Park \u2013 this week denied planning permission to be turned into a \u00a3200m single home \u2022 A 50% stake in the Shell Centre on London\u2019s South Bank \u2022 Half of One Hyde Park, the world\u2019s most expensive apartment block \u2022 The former US embassy building in Grosvenor Square \u2022 The site of Chelsea Barracks in west London, being turned into a luxury housing estate \u2022 20% slice of Camden market \u2022 Stakes in Barclays, Sainsbury\u2019s, the London Stock Exchange and Heathrow \u2022 And coming soon: Canary Wharf, after the controlling group capitulated and recommended a \u00a32.6bn bid to shareholders Julia Kollewe",

The airline\u2019s chief executive officer, Akbar Al Baker, already sits on the board of Heathrow where Qatar <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/17/qatar-buy-20-baa-share-heathrow\" title=\"\">owns a 20% stake</a>.</p> <p>Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, the BA owner, said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to have Qatar Airways, one of the world\u2019s premier airlines, as a long-term supportive shareholder. We will talk to them about what opportunities exist to work more closely together and further IAG\u2019s ambitions as the leading global airline group.\u201d</p> <p>However, BA\u2019s biggest trade union said Qatar Airways\u2019 employment practices, which forbid female staff to marry and allow the termination of contracts for pregnancy, were a cause for alarm.</p> <p>\u201cQatar Airways\u2019 treatment of its workforce is cause for serious concern, and is currently subject to a formal complaint to the UN\u2019s international labour organisation. Given the union-initiated progressive work that has taken place at BA to eliminate a number of discriminatory practices, this is an opportunity for IAG to impress upon Qatar the benefits of such an approach.\u201d</p> <p>The International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation has documented a range of other breaches of rights at the airline, including curfews, surveillance and summary dismissals leading to expulsion from the Gulf. Executives at Barcelona football club, which is sponsored by Qatar Airways, this week said they would be reviewing the deal owing to social conditions in Qatar.</p> <p>Qatar Airways has described the ITF allegations as inaccurate. A spokesman told the Guardian in a previous response to the claims: \u201cOur contracts are transparent and reflect important safety standards in the aviation industry, and local regulations, and are not dissimilar to other airlines or private-sector companies operating both in the Middle East and beyond.\u201d</p> <p>BA sponsored Qatar\u2019s entry into the Oneworld airline alliance, and they also have a cargo partnership. Qatar has indicated it would seek to extend ties following the investment, which could include codeshares on flights via the Gulf state \u2013 allowing the airlines to sell tickets on each other\u2019s planes.</p> <p>Baker said: \u201cIAG represents an excellent opportunity to further develop our westwards strategy.\u201d</p> <p>Qatar Airways is prohibited from owning more than a minority stake in IAG under EU ownership rules and said it does not currently intend to increase its 9.99% shareholding.</p> <p>IAG was formed by the merger of BA and Iberia in 2011 and has since acquired the Spanish low-cost carrier Vueling. It is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/27/aer-lingus-recommens-iag-offer\" title=\"\">pursuing the acquisition of Irish carrier Aer Lingus</a>, whose shareholders include Abu Dhabi-based airline Etihad.</p> <h2>What the Qataris own in Britain</h2> <p>\u2022 HSBC Tower, the bank\u2019s global headquarters in Canary Wharf</p> <p>\u2022 The Shard on the south bank of the Thames (95%)</p> <p>\u2022 Harrods, bought in 2010 for a reported \u00a31.5bn</p> <p>\u2022 The Olympic Village in east London</p> <p>\u2022 Numbers 1-3 Cornwall Terrace, Regent\u2019s Park \u2013 this week denied planning permission to be turned into a \u00a3200m single home</p> <p>\u2022 A 50% stake in the Shell Centre on London\u2019s South Bank</p> <p>\u2022 Half of One Hyde Park, the world\u2019s most expensive apartment block</p> <p>\u2022 The former US embassy building in Grosvenor Square</p> <p>\u2022 The site of Chelsea Barracks in west London, being turned into a luxury housing estate</p> <p>\u2022 20% slice of Camden market</p> <p>\u2022 Stakes in Barclays, Sainsbury\u2019s, the London Stock Exchange and Heathrow</p> <p>\u2022 And coming soon: Canary Wharf, after the controlling group capitulated and recommended a \u00a32.6bn bid to shareholders</p> <p><strong>Julia Kollewe</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Former Dixons chairman John Allan is tipped to be named as the next chairman of Tesco after his rival, Ian Cheshire, former chief executive of B&amp;Q-owner Kingfisher, withdrew from the race. Cheshire is understood to have turned down the role because he wants another chief executive position rather than a chairmanship. His decision is likely to disappoint Tesco as his experience in the day-to-day management of a large international retail group would have complemented the supermarket\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis \u2013 a former Unilever executive who has no retail experience. Allan became co-deputy chairman of Dixons Carphone after the merger of the electricals retailer with mobile phone store Carphone Warehouse last year. He is also chairman of housebuilder Barratts and sits on the board of Royal Mail. He began his career in the consumer goods industry at Lever Brothers, Bristol-Myers Company and Fine Fare before going on to become chief executive of distribution company Exel. Recent reports had suggested that only Allan and Cheshire were currently in the frame to replace Sir Richard Broadbent, who is stepping down in the wake of Tesco\u2019s plunging profits and a \u00a3263m accounting scandal. It is possible that other City figures could make the shortlist. Separately, it has emerged that Tesco has called in management consultants to advise on a major shakeup of the groceries it sells. Thousands of products are expected to be dropped. The supermarket giant is working with Boston Consulting Group on the review, which is expected to see the number of products reduced from 90,000 to between 65,000 and 70,000. Earlier this month, new boss Lewis said its range had become too big under predecessor Philip Clarke, making it difficult to manage.",

He is also chairman of housebuilder Barratts and sits on the board of Royal Mail.</p> <p>He began his career in the consumer goods industry at Lever Brothers, Bristol-Myers Company and Fine Fare before going on to become chief executive of distribution company Exel.</p> <p>Recent reports had suggested that only Allan and Cheshire were currently in the frame to replace Sir Richard Broadbent, who is stepping down in the wake of Tesco\u2019s plunging profits and a \u00a3263m accounting scandal. It is possible that other City figures could make the shortlist.</p> <p>Separately, it has emerged that Tesco has called in management consultants to advise on a major shakeup of the groceries it sells. Thousands of products are expected to be dropped.</p> <p>The supermarket giant is working with Boston Consulting Group on the review, which is expected to see the number of products reduced from 90,000 to between 65,000 and 70,000. Earlier this month, new boss Lewis said its range had become too big under predecessor Philip Clarke, making it difficult to manage.</p>",

The culprit is not just oil, where the price has more than halved since last summer, but all the commodities that tumble in price when global growth falters. Surpluses of copper, zinc and aluminium have also pushed down prices. Decent harvests and intense competition among the big supermarkets have kept food prices low. Most German commentators reckon falling prices are a temporary phenomenon and should be ignored. Low oil prices will drive growth and the economy will recover. Why ease credit to spur economic activity \u2013 as European Central Bank (ECB) chief Mario Draghi is about to do \u2013 when it will happen soon without any help? No cuts in interest rates or money creation by quantitative easing (QE) are needed, they argue. This thinking, they say, fits with the policy adopted by the Bank of England back in 2011 when UK inflation spiked at 5%. Threadneedle Street refused to react, even when there were economists clamouring for it to raise interest rates. The situation sorted itself out. The ECB has ignored the German protestations and announced \u20ac1.1tn of QE over the next year. The question is, can it make a difference? The majority view inside the ECB\u2019s Frankfurt bunker is that falling prices are an indication of weak demand. If it can use QE to buy government debt, preferably not from banks but from other lenders that will use the cash to boost consumer and business borrowing, then the eurozone economy might just gain some momentum. Following the same line of argument, prices will reflate, or at least stabilise, as confidence rises among consumers and businesses. But \u20ac1.1tn of QE is not very much in the context of a \u20ac10tn eurozone economy. Spread across the 19 euro members it amounts to only a fraction of the support most economists believe is needed for a noticeable boost to credit. And the eurozone economy is still dogged by the imbalances that brought financial crisis in 2010, when Greece ran out of money and Germany ruled out transfers within the currency loan, instead offering only more loans. As HSBC\u2019s chief economist Stephen King said this week, it is not deflation that is slowly strangling the eurozone economy so much as the continuing dominance of Germany, which likes everyone to buy its goods while it shuns imports. \u201cGermans struggle to understand that a large BoP [balance of payments] surplus means their savings are used to acquire foreign rather than domestic assets. And that those foreign assets may, at times, offer the wrong mix of risk &amp; reward. Creditors and debtors two sides of same coin,\u201d he said in a couple of tweets summing up his views. He was referring to Greece, but could as easily have included Italy, Portugal and Spain \u2013 even though the latter is growing these days. These countries need a change in the balance of power more than they need QE. As Richard Batley, a senior economist at Lombard Street Research, said on Friday: \u201cWe need to remember that the real imbalances of the euro area cannot be solved by monetary policy alone. ECB policy is ultimately little more than a painkiller \u2013 but at least ECB QE is now prescription strength.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK fund manager predicts stock market plunge during next recession", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the UK\u2019s most successful hedge-fund managers has issued a stark warning that the global economy faces a downturn that will be \u201cremembered in a hundred years\u201d and leave stock markets facing devastation. Crispin Odey, best known for anticipating that banks would go bust in 2008, made his gloomy predictions in a missive to clients of his Odey Asset Management business in which he warns that the European Central Bank\u2019s \u20ac1.1tn (\u00a3730bn) bond-buying programme announced last week will not stave off a slump. He is not only pessimistic about the firepower of the central bank to inject life in to moribund eurozone markets but also about China, where recent data showed growth had slowed to 7.4%. Acknowledging he is gloomier than rivals, Odey said: \u201cThis down cycle is likely to be remembered in a hundred years \u2026 Sadly this down cycle will cause a great deal of damage, precisely because it will happen despite the efforts of central banks to thwart it.\u201d He concluded: \u201cWe are in the first stage of this downturn. It is too early to see what will happen \u2013 a change of this magnitude means the darkness and mist is very great\u201d. Odey \u2013 who reportedly was paid \u00a347.8m in 2013 \u2013 earned a reputation for being a canny if controversial investor in the runup to the banking crisis when he was placing bets that bank shares would fall, notably those of Bradford &amp; Bingley which was later rescued by taxpayers in September 2008. He has not always called markets correctly and early in his career suffered losses when the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in 1994. Central banks are currently adopting measures to cut interest rates to counter the impact of the 2008 banking crisis and injecting cash into markets by buying back bonds. Odey, though, warns central banks are running out of options and that investors are being overly reliant on them to bolster growth. \u201cWe used all our monetary firepower to avoid the first downturn in 2007-09, so we are really at a dangerous point to try to counter the effects of a slowing China, falling commodities and emerging markets and the ultimate first-world effects. This is the heart of the message. If economic activity far from picks up, but... falters, then there will be a painful round of debt default,\u201d he said. The markets are already digesting the implications of the price of oil, which has more than halved in six months, to below $50 a barrel, while foreign exchange dealers have been rattled by the sudden move by the Swiss central bank two weeks ago to stop trying to hold the value of the Swiss franc against the euro at 120. \u201cFor me the bearish opportunity looks as great as it was in 07/09, if only because people are still looking at what is happening and believe that each event is an individual, isolated event. Whether it\u2019s seen as the oil price fall or the Swiss franc move, they\u2019re seen as exceptions,\u201d he said. Odey also predicted that markets will take more note of politics this year. \u201cThis time around, the problem we have as well is that politics will start to rear its head and we are left to deal with politicians who are increasingly critical of the capitalist system\u2019s ability to allocate capital,\u201d he said. He is concerned that a faltering Chinese economy will have a knock-on effect to those economies linked to China, naming Australia, South Africa and Brazil. He is also analysing the fall in commodity prices and cites the impact of the oil price on the economies of countries in the Middle East, Venezuela, Argentina and Norway. He is one of the best connected fund mangers in the City, married to Nichola Pease, who has run a rival fund management firm and is a descendant of the founders of Barclays Bank. His previous wife was Rupert Murdoch\u2019s eldest daughter Prudence. The \u20ac306m (\u00a3228m) Odey Pan European fund, for which the letter was written, has achieved a rate of return of 15% in the year to 23 January.",

If economic activity far from picks up, but... falters, then there will be a painful round of debt default,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The markets are already digesting the implications of the price of oil, which has more than halved in six months, to below $50 a barrel, while foreign exchange dealers have been rattled by the sudden move by the Swiss central bank two weeks ago to stop trying to hold the value of the Swiss franc against the euro at 120.</p> <p>\u201cFor me the bearish opportunity looks as great as it was in 07/09, if only because people are still looking at what is happening and believe that each event is an individual, isolated event. Whether it\u2019s seen as the oil price fall or the Swiss franc move, they\u2019re seen as exceptions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Odey also predicted that markets will take more note of politics this year. \u201cThis time around, the problem we have as well is that politics will start to rear its head and we are left to deal with politicians who are increasingly critical of the capitalist system\u2019s ability to allocate capital,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He is concerned that a faltering Chinese economy will have a knock-on effect to those economies linked to China, naming Australia, South Africa and Brazil. He is also analysing the fall in commodity prices and cites the impact of the oil price on the economies of countries in the Middle East, Venezuela, Argentina and Norway.</p> <p>He is one of the best connected fund mangers in the City, married to Nichola Pease, who has run a rival fund management firm and is a descendant of the founders of Barclays Bank. His previous wife was Rupert Murdoch\u2019s eldest daughter Prudence.</p> <p>The \u20ac306m (\u00a3228m) Odey Pan European fund, for which the letter was written, has achieved a rate of return of 15% in the year to 23 January.</p>",

She wondered what it would it be like to eat doughnuts and the mysterious, sponge-like Twinkie on a New York City street corner in between bouts of fighting crime. </p> <p> Bloomfield eventually did get to New York City, but not as a cop. Instead, she landed as the chef and co-owner of The Spotted Pig, the city\u2019s first gastro pub, which opened in 2004.

You have to be focused, work hard and just keep pushing to be successful.\u201d <br></p> <p>\u201cStraightforward\u201d and \u201cunpretentious\u201d is how Alice Waters, the pioneering chef and owner of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California, describes Bloomfield. Waters spearheaded the organic and locally sourced ingredient movement in the 1970s, which today is de rigueur for high-end restaurants in most cities. Bloomfield spent time at Chez Panisse when The Pig was under construction, an experience she likens to a pilgrimage.</p> <p>Despite Bloomfield\u2019s down-to-earth demeanor, \u201cmicromanager\u201d, \u201cperfectionist\u201d and \u201ccontrol freak\u201d are words her loquacious American business partner, Ken Friedman, affectionately uses to describe her. </p> <p>Bloomfield credits her success to her working-class background and the strong work ethic it instilled in her. \u201cNot everything is going to be handed to you on a silver platter,\u201d says Bloomfield, who had to \u201cknuckle down\u201d and strive for what she wanted. </p> <p>One of Bloomfield\u2019s former chefs coined the term \u201canal rustic\u201d to describe her food \u2013 simple, fresh, forthright dishes that may look effortlessly plated but in fact have been agonized over behind the scenes. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb038cce145bc27cf8c818acc70a406aa82c93f2\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/29/1422549830662/c6689b49-5574-44bd-8338-0b0977ddda63-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Diners at The Spotted Pig, which Bloomfield opened in 2004 in Manhattan.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diners at The Spotted Pig, which Bloomfield opened in 2004 in Manhattan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Roberts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having spent time in England, Friedman understands there\u2019s a difference between most Brits and Americans. In the US, there\u2019s no shame in having career ambitions way beyond one\u2019s socioeconomic class (and broadcasting said ambitions to anyone who will listen). <br></p> <p>\u201cBritish people sort of apologize for wanting to succeed in lots of ways still,\u201d says Friedman. He attributes this to his country\u2019s rigid class system, which he compares unfavourably to that of the US. </p> <p>\u201cI want to succeed, I want money, I want fame, I want it all!\u201d says Friedman, half laughing, as he channels \u201cthe typical American\u201d. With an air of anthropological wonderment, he says, \u201cApril has this ambition that\u2019s different than Americans\u2019 ambition.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cApril doesn\u2019t want to make money without doing the work herself,\u201d he explains, noting that she\u2019s remained very hands-on in all the kitchens, even at Tosca, their newest restaurant in San Francisco. </p> <p>Where Bloomfield is decidedly English is in her cuisine. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to remember your roots,\u201d says Bloomfield, sporting an apron over kitchen whites, her hair pulled back from her face. Revamped English classics pop up on her menus \u2013 from blood sausages to scrumpets, fish and chips to Scotch eggs \u2013 all of which can be paired with a swill of hard cider. <br></p> <p>Bloomfield says there are probably some dishes from home that shouldn\u2019t be resurrected. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t quite found one yet!\u201d she says, laughing.</p> <p>On a recent afternoon in The Spotted Pig\u2019s third floor private kitchen, above the bustling lunch crowd where regulars like Bill Clinton and Kanye West might eat a $21 burger, Bloomfield is clearly in her element.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1edff39c29246e2f3bcd75916d4d0958368e795e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/29/1422549146788/0d76c7e5-7577-4feb-98f2-dac3b5a3fd7a-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Breslin\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A staff member writing the daily specials at The Breslin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Roberts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> She chops orange-fleshed kabocha squash and saut\u00e9s garlic for an experimental curried-soup recipe, possibly for her upcoming A Girl and Her Greens cookbook, while her assistant takes notes. A huge pot of chicken carcasses, heads included, simmers on the back burner for future stock.</p> <p>Bloomfield followed in the footsteps of her two older sisters by going to cooking school. She worked her way up the restaurant ranks, from a brief interlude at a Holiday Inn restaurant to a position at London\u2019s renowned River Caf\u00e9, then run by Rose Gray, who has since died, and Ruth Rogers. <br></p> <p>\u201cI used to lie awake at night thinking, \u2018I want to work there,\u2019\u201d recalls Bloomfield of the years before she worked for Gray and Rogers, \u201cbut never thought I was good enough.\u201d She credits the River Caf\u00e9 for teaching her everything she knows about food.</p> <p> Yet after four years at the River Caf\u00e9, she was looking for a new challenge. </p> <p>Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, her future business partner, Friedman, was having a meltdown of sorts. He had devoted his life to music, promoting Buzzcocks and Gang of Four concerts in college and later managing UB40 and The Smiths, but had suddenly grown alarmingly bored with the business. <br></p> <p>He soon shifted his passion to opening an establishment that would pair a barlike atmosphere (because he hated to dress up) with excellent food (because he fancied himself a foodie).</p> <p> Friedman, who is a towering, friendly figure, teamed up with his \u201cbest chef friend\u201d, Mario Batali, one of The Spotted Pig\u2019s many high-profile investors. <br></p> <p>In search of a chef, they initially approached Jamie Oliver. According to Friedman, he \u201cgiggled\u201d, saying they\u2019d never be able to afford him, and suggested Bloomfield. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6925041cf8467e3061c81ab18f4f2ec66f80cb69\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/29/1422549367816/115890f6-f897-46bd-8ec5-16ea402d0d07-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"The bar at the Spotted Pig.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bar at the Spotted Pig.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Roberts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> \u201cI was, like, in love with her before I even met her,\u201d recalls Friedman. Not only was she from Birmingham, a working-class city with a sense of humor he loved, but she was also a woman, which he considered \u201cpunk rock\u201d, his guiding principle, because there were not many female chefs at the time. <br></p> <p>Within 15 minutes of their first meeting, Friedman recounts Batali saying \u201cshe\u2019s the one\u201d. When Batali spotted the oven burns on her arms, her status was elevated to \u201cbadass\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShe took a real chance on me,\u201d says Friedman earnestly. \u201cIn a lot of ways, I was some mid-life crisis guy, trying to open a cafeteria for my music business buddies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Pig\u201d, as it\u2019s nicknamed, was a wild success from the start. \u201cI had an inkling that what I was cooking was delicious \u2013 I loved it,\u201d says Bloomfield, but she was shocked by how well it was received; the discerning West Village neighborhood embraced it. <br></p> <p>The atmosphere, as in all five of her restaurants, is always rollicking and inclusive despite its high-profile clientele, who dine amid floor-to-ceiling pig paraphernalia, from pork dissection charts to piglet Christmas lights. </p> <p>Bloomfield realized early in her career that while being a perfectionist workhorse was admirable, it could eventually stunt her career by keeping it small. <br></p> <p>She made the conscious decision to relinquish some control and let employees take on responsibility, allowing them to advance in the company and her to focus on new projects and expanding. Bloomfield encourages shared responsibility among her chefs; one of her favorite sayings is \u201cwork smarter, not harder\u201d.</p> <p>Friedman has an easygoing demeanor, excelling at front-of-house duties, but he admits to being, like Bloomfield, a control freak. Recently at The Breslin, their second gastro pub, he seemed profoundly disappointed that a mirror, one of hundreds of decorative hanging pieces, was a few inches off center. </p> <p>Despite their shared \u201ccontrol-freakism\u201d, their different personalities balance each other out. <br></p> <p>Friedman says he believes that if Bloomfield were not his partner, he\u2019d probably have a slew of mediocre restaurants around the globe rather than the highly rated restaurants he owns now. <br></p> <p>Bloomfield\u2019s advice to those who dream of a culinary career matches Waters\u2019: be true to yourself. \u201cListen to yourself,\u201d she instructs \u2013 which suddenly triggers an impromptu rendition of the melodramatic 1980s Roxette hit Listen To Your Heart for several seconds, followed by laughter. <br></p> <p>Regaining her composure, she adds that whether one is devoted to selling chicken wings out of a truck or cooking deconstructive haute cuisine in a stuffy restaurant, as long it\u2019s a genuine interest, and the research has been done, it will possess integrity and soul. \u201cDo everything in life with passion and fire,\u201d she adds, \u201cboth professionally and personally.\u201d </p>",

Bloomfield spent time at Chez Panisse when The Pig was under construction, an experience she likens to a pilgrimage. Despite Bloomfield\u2019s down-to-earth demeanor, \u201cmicromanager\u201d, \u201cperfectionist\u201d and \u201ccontrol freak\u201d are words her loquacious American business partner, Ken Friedman, affectionately uses to describe her. Bloomfield credits her success to her working-class background and the strong work ethic it instilled in her. \u201cNot everything is going to be handed to you on a silver platter,\u201d says Bloomfield, who had to \u201cknuckle down\u201d and strive for what she wanted. One of Bloomfield\u2019s former chefs coined the term \u201canal rustic\u201d to describe her food \u2013 simple, fresh, forthright dishes that may look effortlessly plated but in fact have been agonized over behind the scenes. Having spent time in England, Friedman understands there\u2019s a difference between most Brits and Americans. In the US, there\u2019s no shame in having career ambitions way beyond one\u2019s socioeconomic class (and broadcasting said ambitions to anyone who will listen). \u201cBritish people sort of apologize for wanting to succeed in lots of ways still,\u201d says Friedman. He attributes this to his country\u2019s rigid class system, which he compares unfavourably to that of the US. \u201cI want to succeed, I want money, I want fame, I want it all!\u201d says Friedman, half laughing, as he channels \u201cthe typical American\u201d. With an air of anthropological wonderment, he says, \u201cApril has this ambition that\u2019s different than Americans\u2019 ambition.\u201d \u201cApril doesn\u2019t want to make money without doing the work herself,\u201d he explains, noting that she\u2019s remained very hands-on in all the kitchens, even at Tosca, their newest restaurant in San Francisco. Where Bloomfield is decidedly English is in her cuisine. \u201cIt\u2019s good to remember your roots,\u201d says Bloomfield, sporting an apron over kitchen whites, her hair pulled back from her face. Revamped English classics pop up on her menus \u2013 from blood sausages to scrumpets, fish and chips to Scotch eggs \u2013 all of which can be paired with a swill of hard cider. Bloomfield says there are probably some dishes from home that shouldn\u2019t be resurrected. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t quite found one yet!\u201d she says, laughing. On a recent afternoon in The Spotted Pig\u2019s third floor private kitchen, above the bustling lunch crowd where regulars like Bill Clinton and Kanye West might eat a $21 burger, Bloomfield is clearly in her element. She chops orange-fleshed kabocha squash and saut\u00e9s garlic for an experimental curried-soup recipe, possibly for her upcoming A Girl and Her Greens cookbook, while her assistant takes notes. A huge pot of chicken carcasses, heads included, simmers on the back burner for future stock. Bloomfield followed in the footsteps of her two older sisters by going to cooking school. She worked her way up the restaurant ranks, from a brief interlude at a Holiday Inn restaurant to a position at London\u2019s renowned River Caf\u00e9, then run by Rose Gray, who has since died, and Ruth Rogers. \u201cI used to lie awake at night thinking, \u2018I want to work there,\u2019\u201d recalls Bloomfield of the years before she worked for Gray and Rogers, \u201cbut never thought I was good enough.\u201d She credits the River Caf\u00e9 for teaching her everything she knows about food. Yet after four years at the River Caf\u00e9, she was looking for a new challenge. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, her future business partner, Friedman, was having a meltdown of sorts. He had devoted his life to music, promoting Buzzcocks and Gang of Four concerts in college and later managing UB40 and The Smiths, but had suddenly grown alarmingly bored with the business. He soon shifted his passion to opening an establishment that would pair a barlike atmosphere (because he hated to dress up) with excellent food (because he fancied himself a foodie). Friedman, who is a towering, friendly figure, teamed up with his \u201cbest chef friend\u201d, Mario Batali, one of The Spotted Pig\u2019s many high-profile investors. In search of a chef, they initially approached Jamie Oliver. According to Friedman, he \u201cgiggled\u201d, saying they\u2019d never be able to afford him, and suggested Bloomfield. \u201cI was, like, in love with her before I even met her,\u201d recalls Friedman. Not only was she from Birmingham, a working-class city with a sense of humor he loved, but she was also a woman, which he considered \u201cpunk rock\u201d, his guiding principle, because there were not many female chefs at the time. Within 15 minutes of their first meeting, Friedman recounts Batali saying \u201cshe\u2019s the one\u201d. When Batali spotted the oven burns on her arms, her status was elevated to \u201cbadass\u201d. \u201cShe took a real chance on me,\u201d says Friedman earnestly. \u201cIn a lot of ways, I was some mid-life crisis guy, trying to open a cafeteria for my music business buddies.\u201d \u201cThe Pig\u201d, as it\u2019s nicknamed, was a wild success from the start. \u201cI had an inkling that what I was cooking was delicious \u2013 I loved it,\u201d says Bloomfield, but she was shocked by how well it was received; the discerning West Village neighborhood embraced it. The atmosphere, as in all five of her restaurants, is always rollicking and inclusive despite its high-profile clientele, who dine amid floor-to-ceiling pig paraphernalia, from pork dissection charts to piglet Christmas lights. Bloomfield realized early in her career that while being a perfectionist workhorse was admirable, it could eventually stunt her career by keeping it small. She made the conscious decision to relinquish some control and let employees take on responsibility, allowing them to advance in the company and her to focus on new projects and expanding. Bloomfield encourages shared responsibility among her chefs; one of her favorite sayings is \u201cwork smarter, not harder\u201d. Friedman has an easygoing demeanor, excelling at front-of-house duties, but he admits to being, like Bloomfield, a control freak. Recently at The Breslin, their second gastro pub, he seemed profoundly disappointed that a mirror, one of hundreds of decorative hanging pieces, was a few inches off center. Despite their shared \u201ccontrol-freakism\u201d, their different personalities balance each other out. Friedman says he believes that if Bloomfield were not his partner, he\u2019d probably have a slew of mediocre restaurants around the globe rather than the highly rated restaurants he owns now. Bloomfield\u2019s advice to those who dream of a culinary career matches Waters\u2019: be true to yourself. \u201cListen to yourself,\u201d she instructs \u2013 which suddenly triggers an impromptu rendition of the melodramatic 1980s Roxette hit Listen To Your Heart for several seconds, followed by laughter. Regaining her composure, she adds that whether one is devoted to selling chicken wings out of a truck or cooking deconstructive haute cuisine in a stuffy restaurant, as long it\u2019s a genuine interest, and the research has been done, it will possess integrity and soul. \u201cDo everything in life with passion and fire,\u201d she adds, \u201cboth professionally and personally.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British workers are taking home less in real terms than when Tony Blair won his second general election victory in 2001, with men and young people hit hardest by the wage squeeze that followed the financial crisis, according to new research. The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank said wages were 1% lower in the third quarter of 2014 than in the same period 13 years earlier after taking inflation into account. Jonathan Cribb, an author of the report, said: \u201cAlmost all groups have seen real wages fall since the recession.\u201d However, the study finds that women have been relatively cushioned from the worst of the wage cuts because they are more likely to be in public sector jobs, where wages fell less rapidly during the early years of the downturn. Aided at the start of the crisis by the relative stability of public sector wages, women\u2019s average hourly pay fell by 2.5% in real terms between 2008 and 2014, the IFS found, while men\u2019s pay fell by 7.3%. The IFS also singled out younger workers as among the biggest victims of the falling living standards that have become widespread in post-crash Britain. \u201cBetween 2008 and 2014, there is a clear pattern across the age spectrum, with larger falls in earnings at younger ages,\u201d the thinktank found in a detailed study of the state of the labour market. Labour immediately seized on the figures as evidence that Britain was trapped in a \u201ccost of living crisis\u201d. Rachel Reeves, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cThis report shows David Cameron has overseen falling wages and rising insecurity in the labour market. Only Labour has a plan to tackle low pay and to earn our way to rising living standards for all.\u201d But the Conservatives hope that signs of momentum in wage growth will gather pace as the general election approaches. With pay rising modestly in recent months and inflation expected to dip below zero before polling day as plunging oil prices cut the price of petrol, the Tories hope the recent uptick in real wages has come just in time to stir up the feelgood factor before voters go to the polls on 7 May. According to the latest official figures, average weekly earnings rose at an annual rate of 1.7% and the IFS suggested real incomes should continue increasing over the next 12 months. A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cWe understand that the impact of the great recession is still being felt and so we\u2019ve cut income tax for 26 million people, frozen fuel duty and frozen council tax. But the job is not done, which is why we must go on working through the plan that is securing a better future across the country.\u201d Taking a longer-term perspective, and using what it believes are the best measures of wages and inflation, which includes allowing for housing costs, the IFS said living standards remained well below their pre-crisis peak. During the 2009-11 period, when wage declines were most pronounced, the earnings of 22- to 29-year-olds fell by 10.6%, compared with just under 7% for older age groups. Average pay for the over-60s recovered to its pre-crisis level by 2014; but it remained 9% lower than in 2008 for those aged 22 to 29. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the Trade Union Congress, which has labelled the wages squeeze the longest fall in living standards since the Victorian era, said the government must do more than rely on a \u201clucky\u201d run of low inflation numbers to boost salaries. \u201cWe need much stronger wage settlements and more investment in high skilled jobs and a high productivity economy,\u201d she said. Weaker-than-expected pay growth, even as unemployment has fallen rapidly over the past year, smaller-than-expectedpay rises have been a headache for the Treasury because income tax receipts have been lower than expected at this stage of recovery. The IFS indicated that the relative advantage gained from working in the public sector would be reversed in the years ahead because both major parties were promising to press on with public sector pay restraint. \u201cPrivate sector workers have so far experienced larger earnings falls than public sector workers, largely because of the period between the onset of recession and the beginning of the current period of public sector pay restraint in 2011. As that restraint continues, public sector earnings are likely to fall back again relative to private sector earnings,\u201d the IFS said. Despite the perception that the rich have emerged all but unscathed from the crisis of the past six years, the IFS said top earners had suffered larger wage cuts than their lower-paid colleagues, helping wage inequality to narrow slightly. Gavin Kelly, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s six-year pay squeeze has been felt relatively evenly across the income distribution. The lowest paid have been partly protected by the minimum wage which fell by a smaller amount than wages further up the earnings scale, which helps to explain the fall in inequality.\u201d",

      "standfirst": "This recovery has been like no other \u2013 a record number of Britons are in work but the average worker is poorer than before 2008", 
      "body": "<p>There\u2019s been nothing like it in modern times. First there was a recession of extraordinary severity. Then there has been the strangest of recoveries that has seen record numbers of Britons in work but the average worker poorer than before the sky fell in. A lot poorer.</p> <p>The curious story of the UK economy from 2008 to 2014 is sketched out by the Institute for Fiscal Studies today. Dry and dusty it might seem, but the thinktank\u2019s study of \u201cearnings since the recession\u201d tells the story of how the UK sacrificed pay for jobs.</p> <p>This was a break with the past. In previous downturns the victims were those who lost their jobs. Pay for those fortunate enough to stay in employment tended to rise. This time everybody (or nearly everybody) has been a victim. Unemployment has not risen by nearly as much as might have been predicted given the depth of the recession. Rather than a minority of the population suffering a lot of pain, the majority of us have suffered a smaller amount of pain.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say the hit to earnings has been chickenfeed. Far from it. The trend since the second world war has been for earnings to grow more rapidly than prices, leaving people better off year by year. If this pattern had continued, the average worker\u2019s real inflation-adjusted pay would have been 12%-15% higher in 2014 than in 2008. In fact, depending on the yardstick used to measure pay, earnings were anything from 3% to 7.4% below their pre-crisis level.</p> <p>All groups lost out: those in the top 10% of earners and those in the bottom 10%; both public and private sector workers; those in their late teens and early 20s looking for their first job and those in their 60s wooed back into the workforce.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s been nothing like it in modern times. First there was a recession of extraordinary severity. Then there has been the strangest of recoveries that has seen record numbers of Britons in work but the average worker poorer than before the sky fell in. A lot poorer. The curious story of the UK economy from 2008 to 2014 is sketched out by the Institute for Fiscal Studies today. Dry and dusty it might seem, but the thinktank\u2019s study of \u201cearnings since the recession\u201d tells the story of how the UK sacrificed pay for jobs. This was a break with the past. In previous downturns the victims were those who lost their jobs. Pay for those fortunate enough to stay in employment tended to rise. This time everybody (or nearly everybody) has been a victim. Unemployment has not risen by nearly as much as might have been predicted given the depth of the recession. Rather than a minority of the population suffering a lot of pain, the majority of us have suffered a smaller amount of pain. That\u2019s not to say the hit to earnings has been chickenfeed. Far from it. The trend since the second world war has been for earnings to grow more rapidly than prices, leaving people better off year by year. If this pattern had continued, the average worker\u2019s real inflation-adjusted pay would have been 12%-15% higher in 2014 than in 2008. In fact, depending on the yardstick used to measure pay, earnings were anything from 3% to 7.4% below their pre-crisis level. All groups lost out: those in the top 10% of earners and those in the bottom 10%; both public and private sector workers; those in their late teens and early 20s looking for their first job and those in their 60s wooed back into the workforce. In this respect, George Osborne was right: we have all been in it together. But the losses have not been distributed equally. Women have done less poorly than men, primarily because they are more disproportionately likely to work in the public sector, where real earnings have fallen by less than in the private sector. Weekly earnings for a woman smack in the middle of the income distribution (the median) fell by 2.8% between 2008 and 2014; for the equivalent man they fell by 9%. This, though, is largely the result of private sector earnings responding rapidly to the deep plunge in output in 2008 and early 2009, a period when public sector pay continued to rise. Since late 2009, however, earnings in the public and private sector have fallen by similar amounts.
