      "bodyText": "The government is to launch a tourism action plan including cutting red tape for B&amp;Bs and ready-made train tours as an increasing number of Brits take bank holiday breaks in the UK. Just over 5 million Britons are planning a staycation in the UK over the weekend, 6% more than last year, according to Visit England, the tourism promotion body, after a fall in the value of the pound against the dollar and the euro in the wake of the EU referendum vote. The expected surge comes after a record-breaking first four months of the year for domestic holiday trips in England. From January to April Britons took 11m holiday trips, 8% more than during the same period last year, according to Visit England. They spent \u00a32.8bn, 22% up on last year, more than ever before. That continued a strong year in 2015 for staycations when the number of trips and the amount spent both rose 7% on the previous year. The prime minister, Theresa May, who chose to holiday in the Swiss Alps this month, said: \u201cTourism is vitally important to the UK and the sector goes from strength to strength. Our stunning scenery, centuries-old monuments and cultural traditions continue to draw visitors from both home and abroad.\u201d The government action plan will include internationally promoted rail travel deals, with five easily bookable itineraries that will help tourists get around the UK, although it\u2019s not clear if they will be assured a seat. There will also be changes to regulations to let B&amp;Bs offer visitors a welcome drink without the need for an alcohol licence, or to pick up guests from a station without applying to become a taxi service. Around \u00a340m of previously announced funds will also be awarded on Friday to a string of projects to help boost tourism in England outside London. Among the projects, money will go towards boosting golf tourism, increasing visitor numbers to Kent\u2019s gardens and gourmet restaurants, the south-west coastal path plus other rural areas. The investment comes after turnover for small and medium-sized hotels, B&amp;Bs, cafes and restaurants in the UK rose 6.4% in the first half of this year, compared with last, with London experiencing the greatest increase in the number of new businesses followed by the south-east and the north-west, according to a Barclays survey. An 11% drop in the value of the pound against the euro means that a holiday within the eurozone will cost a family of four at least \u00a3245 more now than it would have done before Britain voted to leave the EU. Terror attacks in France, Belgium and popular package holiday destinations such as Turkey have also changed behaviour. Scotland is experiencing particularly strong growth as families flock to Skye and the Highlands to visit locations used in Stephen Spielberg\u2019s BFG film or the Outlander TV series. \u201cSkye has been absolutely crazy busy this summer \u2013 all businesses are saying they have never seen a year like it,\u201d said a Visit Scotland spokesman. But the whole of Scotland has enjoyed a busy season with some businesses in Arran calling it their busiest summer for more than a decade. Rob Ganley, of the Camping &amp; Caravanning Club, said it reached its highest ever number of members this spring and has continued to grow since. \u201cThe staycation trend has gone from strength to strength from the credit crunch to exchange rate changes and concerns about security overseas,\u201d he said. Nearly a fifth of Brits questioned told the Barclays survey they were planning to holiday in the UK this year because they were worried about terror attacks abroad while 22% said they would holiday in the UK to save money. More than a quarter wanted to cut down on travel time. Brits have not been put off travelling abroad altogether. An estimated 2 million are expected to head abroad this weekend, just over 5% more than last year, according to ABTA, the travel association. Spain, where temperatures are expected to hit the low 30s over the weekend, is one of the top choices with Malaga, Mallorca and Barcelona some of the most popular short-haul destinations. Thomas Cook said last month that bookings from the UK were down 1% in the three months to the end of June, but it expected a strong start to the winter season in the UK, with bookings up by 19% despite Brexit worries. Some holidaymakers may be getting their trip in now while it is more affordable. Travel operator Tui, has warned that UK holidaymakers will have to pay higher prices next summer due to the weakening pound. However, spending on holidays is generally on the rise as people seek out experiences rather than consume things. Official data shows that households are spending less on clothes and food but more on holidays, cars, entertainment and eating out. David McCorquodale, UK head of retail at KPMG, said retailers were now having to battle it out fiercely with holidays and other experiences for a share of people\u2019s spare cash. \u201cUndoubtedly people are spending more and more on experiences rather than stuff to put in the wardrobe. Just look at the rise in music festivals. People like experiences as they make you feel a bit better than you did before, rather than a new jumper,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The US has been accused of \u201cbehaving like a tax haven\u201d, in an escalating war of words between Washington and Brussels over the European commission\u2019s anti-trust cases against Apple, Amazon and Starbucks. On Wednesday, the US Treasury threatened retaliation if Europe continues its tax crusade against American multinationals. Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s top anti-trust regulator, is expected to conclude her state aid investigation into Apple as early as next month. If her ruling goes against the Californian tech group, it could be ordered to hand over as much as $19bn (\u00a314.4bn) in unpaid taxes to the Irish government. A white paper commissioned by the US Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, accused Europe of targeting American companies disproportionately and behaving like a \u201csupranational tax authority\u201d. The claims have now prompted a swift rebuttal from MEPs and the European commission. \u201cThe US Treasury prefers defending the interest of its multinationals rather than promoting international cooperation to fight corporate tax avoidance,\u201d said Molly Scott Cato MEP, a spokeswoman for the Green party on tax affairs in the European parliament. Campaigners are furious because the US has failed to back two major initiatives designed to combat tax avoidance and money laundering. They are the creation of public registers of the owners of private companies and the automatic sharing of bank account information between countries, known as the Common Reporting Standard. \u201cThe US is behaving like a tax haven by operating a deferral system which allows US companies to stash profits offshore,\u201d said Cato. \u201cThe commission is seeking to prevent exactly this sort of free-riding and to ensure that tax is paid where economic value is added.\u201d America\u2019s 500 largest companies have accumulated a record $2.4tn offshore, according to the pressure group Citizens for Tax Justice. The money, which comes from sales outside of their domestic market, has built up in tax haven subsidiaries because multinationals are refusing to bring the cash into the US, where it would incur a 30% corporation tax charge. Anneliese Dodds MEP, tax lead for Labour in the European parliament, said: \u201cThe timing of this [white paper] seems highly suspect, falling as it does right in the middle of election season in the US. Instead the US government should be working with the EU commission to clamp down on tax evaders and aggressive tax avoiders, rather than criticising attempts to make the system fairer.\u201d The EU commission said on Wednesday: \u201cAll companies, no matter their nationality, generating and recording their profits in an EU country should pay taxes in line with national tax laws. \u201cUnder EU state aid rules, national tax authorities cannot give tax benefits to selected companies that are not available to others. These state aid rules and the relevant legal principles have been in place for a long time.\u201d Lew\u2019s white paper threatened retaliation, saying the US \u201ccontinues to consider potential responses should the commission continue its present course\u201d. Existing tax treaties could be revised and this would have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on US investment into Europe, it claimed. The commission has already ruled that tax advantages negotiated by Starbucks with the Netherlands government and by the Italian carmaker Fiat with Luxembourg amounted to illegal state aid, with \u20ac20m-\u20ac30m potentially owed by each company. In January, the commission took a preliminary view that Amazon\u2019s deal with Luxembourg also amounted to state aid. A final decision is pending. Apple boss Tim Cook has dismissed the claim that his company avoids taxes overseas as \u201cpolitical crap\u201d. The iPhone maker has paid as little as 2% in tax on its international profits, most of which are routed through Ireland. Cook told the Washington Post earlier this month: \u201cI hope that we get a fair hearing. If we don\u2019t, then we would obviously appeal it.\u201d Alex Cobham, research director at the pressure group Tax Justice Network, said: \u201cThe US Treasury has fired the first shots of a tax war with Europe. And while it\u2019s wrapped up in a claim to defend international tax cooperation, it looks more like an attempt to prevent an effective measure against international tax-dodging.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mylan, the company that produces the EpiPen, will reduce the cost of its product for some patients through increased financial assistance, the company announced on Thursday. However, the company did not promise to reduce its prices nor did it address the price hikes on its other products, which have seen increases ranging from 20% to 542%. The announcement comes day after a number of lawmakers, including Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, called on Mylan to reduce its prices. EpiPens are used to administer medication to someone experiencing a life-threatening allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis. To reduce the cost of its EpiPen auto-injector, Mylan will issue savings cards that will cover up to $300 of the cost. EpiPens are typically sold as a pair at a cost of $600. Mylan is taking immediate action to ensure that those who need the EpiPen can get one, said Heather Bresch, Mylan\u2019s chief executive officer. But the company did not say that it would reduce the price of its main product nor will it roll back any of the price increases implemented in the past nine years. In the last 12 months alone, Mylan increased EpiPen\u2019s price twice \u2013 each time by 15%. Instead, the company offered to increase financial assistance to those most in need. In her statement, Bresch blamed insurance companies for shifting costs on patients and called on \u201call involved\u201d to help address the US healthcare crisis. \u201cWe recognize the significant burden on patients from continued, rising insurance premiums and being forced increasingly to pay the full list price for medicines at the pharmacy counter,\u201d she said. In addition to issuing $300-savings cards, Mylan changed the policy on who will now be eligible for free EpiPens. Previously, families of four earning below $48,600 qualified for free EpiPens. That threshold will now be $97,200. Consumers will also soon be able to order their EpiPens directly from Mylan, which the company says will help reduce their costs. Mylan will continue to offer free EpiPens to schools. The news comes just a day after Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton issued a statement calling on Mylan to reduce the price of the EpiPen, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients.\u201d Even as Mylan takes steps to make its EpiPen more affordable, lawmakers have called on Bersch to appear before US Congress and explain why the price of EpiPen went up by 461% since Mylan acquired it in 2007. \u201cWe are concerned that these drastic price increases could have a serious effect on the health and well-being of every day Americans,\u201d senators Susan Collins and Claire McCaskill told Bresch in a letter. \u201cAs leaders of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, we are particularly concerned that seniors have access to EpiPen because, according to Mylan\u2019s website, older Americans \u2018may be at an increased risk of having a more severe anaphylactic reaction if they are exposed to biting and stinging insects\u2019.\u201d They requested that Bresch testify within the next two weeks. Even as Mylan was announcing the steps that it is taking to make its EpiPen more affordable, Sarah Jessica Parker issued a statement announcing that she had terminated her relationship with the company. Earlier this year, the Sex and the City actress served as a spokesperson for Mylan, helping raise awareness about anaphylaxis and life-threatening allergies. \u201cI was recently involved in an initiative to raise awareness for anaphylaxis. It\u2019s a cause deeply important to my because of my son\u2019s life-threatening peanut allergy. The epinephrine auto-injector is a vital part of our healthcare, as it is for the many who are at risk. I recently learned that the price of the EpiPen has been systematically raised by Mylan to a point that renders the medication cost-prohibitive for countless people,\u201d Parker said in a statement, which she posted on Instagram on Thursday morning. \u201cI\u2019m left disappointed, saddened and deeply concerned by Mylan\u2019s actions. I do not condone this decision and I have ended my relationship with Mylan as a direct result of it. I hope they will seriously consider the outpouring of voices of those millions of people who are dependent on the device, and take swift action to lower the cost to be more affordable for whom it is a life-saving necessity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "it has been the main obsession with stock markets for most of the week, but the long awaited speech by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is almost upon us. Her comments at Jackson Hole in the US on Friday afternoon will be scrutinised for hints about when the central bank could raise interest rates, with various analysts expecting her to be hawkish, dovish or neutral. With that uncertainty it is no surprise that investors have been erring on the side of caution. And after recent falls in the oil price, along with a drop in pharmaceutical shares following comments on excessive pricing by US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, stock markets ended the day in negative territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 18.88 points or 0.28% lower at 6816.90 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.88% to 10529.59 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.65% at 4406.61 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.07% to 16710.78 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.65% at 8599.5 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.37% to 565.83 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently fairly stable, down just 6 points or 0.04%. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, adds his voice to those expecting a US rate rise in December: Esther George of the Kansas Fed gave markets something to chew over, with yet another hawkish comment coming in a long line of Fed members keen to talk about higher rates. After appearances from Dudley and Fischer last week, today\u2019s input from voting member George adds yet another voice to the increasingly deafening push for a rate hike in the coming months. With the election looking unpredictable, the likeliness is that members will see December as the month to press the button once more, one year on from the contentious 2015 rise. It is hard to see Janet Yellen delivering anything other than a relatively hawkish outlook tomorrow [at Jackson Hole] and with the dollar having suffered heavily in recent weeks, tomorrow could be a turning point for foreign exchange markets. Another comment suggesting that the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers in the US could be a damp squib, despite expectations that Fed chair Janet Yellen could hint at future rate rises. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: Investors continue to hold back from taking on additional market exposure ahead of tomorrow\u2019s speech from Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. Few expect the Fed Chairman to say anything explicit about the likelihood or timing of what would be the US central bank\u2019s first rate hike since December last year. Nevertheless, there are hopes that she may give some clues as to the Fed\u2019s thinking over the state of the US economy, and indeed any risks facing the global economy as well. Last week we heard hawkish rhetoric from three Fed members. Then on Sunday Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer provided an upbeat outlook for the US economy saying that he expected growth to pick up following a particularly weak second quarter. Not only that, but he said that the Fed\u2019s targets for inflation and unemployment (the dual mandate) were close to being hit. If Yellen is similarly upbeat in her speech tomorrow, then investors will price in an increased possibility of a September hike. But despite all this chatter and speculation, it seems unlikely that Yellen will want to paint herself into a corner over the future direction of US monetary policy. Consequently, it could be that there\u2019s little of substance in the speech. While we\u2019ve had a clutch of Fed-heads out there trying to persuade investors that September is still \u201clive\u201d when it comes to a rate hike, the minutes from the last meeting in July showed that only one out of ten FOMC-voting members was in favour of tightening monetary policy. In addition, we\u2019ll get a stack of fresh economic data ahead of the Fed\u2019s next meeting, including Non-Farm Payrolls, Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs and inflation numbers. There\u2019s really no point in committing to any course of action until the Fed sees these reports. Finally, I don\u2019t believe that the FOMC has the faintest idea what they should do at the next meeting. And unfortunately we now have a central bank which pays too much attention to stock market movements and appears to relish its ability to influence short-term investor behaviour. Overall, I think there\u2019s just too much importance being attached to this speech. Jackson Hole was a fairly obscure event in years gone by. It only attained its current significance when Ben Bernanke used it as a forum for market manipulation in the wake of the 2008/9 financial crisis. It would be better for all if it went back to being a boring conference for boring people. Back with the UK, and the strong retail sales figures from the CBI back up the idea that any negative effects of Brexit on the economy will only appear slowly, writes economic editor Larry Elliott: While we wait for Fed chair Janet Yellen on Friday, and any hints she gives on US interest rates, there is at least one board member of the US central bank suggesting a rise could be imminent. Speaking on CNBC, Dallas Federal Reserve president Robert Kaplan said the bank should be able to hike rates in the not too distant future, and the case for a rise was strengthening. He said progress was being made on employment and - more slowly - inflation. The latest PMI data means a US rate rise in September is unlikely but could signal a move in December, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at Markit: The ongoing lacklustre economic growth signalled by the flash PMI suggests GDP growth is failing to accelerate in the third quarter from the weak 1.2% pace seen in the second quarter. Historical comparisons indicate that the PMI is signalling an annualised GDP growth rate of just under 1% in the third quarter, based on the data for July and August. With job creation also waning alongside subdued price pressures (the August PMI is consistent with non-farm payrolls rising by just under 130,000), the survey data will fuel expectations that the Fed will be in no rush to tighten policy again. However, as anecdotal evidence from the survey suggests that business activity is being dampened by uncertainty due to the upcoming presidential election, there\u2019s a good chance that the economy will pick up speed again after the vote, leaving a December rate hike on the table. After the better than expected US durable goods and jobless claims figures, a service sector survey for August has missed forecasts. The IHS Markit service sector initial PMI came in at 50.9, down from 51.4 in July and below forecasts of 52. This was the weakest rise in services activity since February. Markit said: U.S. service providers indicated another month of lacklustre growth in August, with business activity, new orders and employment all rising at a slower pace than in July. Survey respondents generally cited subdued underlying demand conditions and uncertainty ahead of the presidential election as factors that had dampened growth in August. Nonetheless, the balance of service sector firms expecting a rise in business activity over the year ahead remained well above the survey-record low seen in June. The composite PMI slipped from 51.8 in July to 51.5. As investors await Fed chair Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday, US markets are heading lower in early trading. There is growing uncertainty over the timing of any US interest rate rise, and Yellen\u2019s comments will be scoured for any hints. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 12 points while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.18% lower. Neil Wilson, market analyst at ETX Capital is decidedly underwhelmed at the prospect of Jackson Hole: Don\u2019t expect much from Jackson Hole. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\u2019s annual economic policy symposium is a serious, sombre affair. It is not a policy meeting, nor is it meant to drive expectations for future policy decisions. It\u2019s a talking shop and we should take the goods on offer with a healthy dose of salt. Markets are incredibly quiet this August (in sharp contrast to last year) so investors are latching on to anything they can, which gives this meeting a lot more attention than it probably deserves. Investors will hang on every word uttered by Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chair. ...But Yellen\u2019s habit of keeping markets guessing with alternately hawkish and dovish remarks should be kept in mind. Indeed what the meeting will highlight is just how hard it is for central banks to normalise policy after years of accommodation. Economists taking part in a Reuters poll believe the Brexit vote will weigh on UK house prices over the next couple of years. Average UK house prices are expected to rise by 2.8% in 2016, 1.3% in 2017, and 2.4% in 2018. London property prices are forecast to increase by 2% in 2016, by zero in 2017, and by 2% in 2018. Some more strong data out of the US. Durable goods orders increased by 4.4% in July, following a 4.2% fall in June according to the US Commerce Department. Economists had forecast a weaker rise of 3.3%. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, says the better-than-expected data do not alter his view that the Federal Reserve will hold rates at its September meeting: Some marginally better than expected durable goods orders don\u2019t change our view that a September rate hike from the Fed is difficult to support. After two consecutive quarters of outright declines in US business investment, durable goods orders for July provide a first insight into how investment in the third quarter is shaping up. And our take on the figures is that the negativity is beginning to abate. But this is far from a big turnaround. The headline 4.4% month-on-month growth in July only just offsets last month\u2019s fall, and the trend for core goods orders and shipments are still both negative. Over in the US, the latest figures showed new claims for unemployment benefit fell unexpectedly by 1,000 in the week ending 20 August to 261,000. It was the third successive weekly fall, and a five-week low according to the US Labor Department data. Economists had forecast a rise to 265,000 new claims. Claims have been below 300,000 - a threshold associated with a strong labour market - for 77 weeks in a row. It is the longest stretch since 1970. The four-week rolling average fell by 1,250 to 264,000 last week. Sticking with Sports Direct, Legal &amp; General Investment Management says it will vote against the re-election of the retailer\u2019s chairman Keith Hellawell at the annual meeting on 7 September. It would be the third consecutive year LGIM has voted against Hellawell\u2019s re-election. It also proposes to vote against the re-election of all non-executive directors at the company. It follows a Guardian investigation last year that revealed Sports Direct warehouse workers were effectively being paid less than the minimum wage because of lengthy security checks at the end of shifts. Earlier this month Sports Direct said warehouse workers would receive back pay totalling about \u00a31m after the retailer admitted breaking the law by not paying the national minimum wage. Sports Direct is back in the headlines after a major investor group spoke out about the retailer\u2019s corporate governance failings. The Investor Forum has 40 members and represents 27% of Sports Direct\u2019s independent shareholders, including Legal &amp; General, Aviva, Standard Life and Fidelity. It was set up two years ago and this is apparently the first time it has made public concerns about a company. Governance failings are clearly resulting in declines in operating performance and long term shareholder value and, given the lack of progress and the broader impact on all stakeholders, the Forum now considers it important to make public its recommendations to the Sports Direct International board. The Investor Forum calls on the board and its founder Mike Ashley to launch an independent review of the company\u2019s \u201centire corporate governance framework\u201d at the annual meeting on 7 September. They must commit to implementing the recommendations of that review, it adds. Andy Griffiths, executive director of the Forum: It is highly unusual for the Investor Forum to consider it necessary to make public their concerns and recommendations in this way. In prior situations we have always managed to work privately with companies to create effective long term solutions. We do not take this step lightly and whilst we welcome SDI\u2019s move to hold an open day, we still have not received an appropriate level of commitment to respond to investor concerns and, as a result, the usual options have been exhausted. Phillip Inman, the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent, has written a handy list of five problems facing central bankers as they head to Jackson Hole for the annual symposium. Here they are in short: Markets are addicted to low rates Negative interest rates A stagnant eurozone Fragile emerging markets Currency wars Read the piece in full here: Applications for British citizenship by EU nationals living in the UK jumped 14% in the run-up to the EU referendum in June. Figures from the Home Office suggest there was a rush for British passports as uncertainty built before the referendum. The 14% rise in passport applications to 15,501 included a 26% rise in applications from Italians and a 9% rise from Polish nationals in Britain. Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that in 2015, one in eight people - or 8.6m - living in the UK were born abroad. It was a 3.5% increase, up from 8.3m in 2014. Annual net migration to Britain fell by 9,000 to 327,000 in the 12 months to March 2016. The price of Brent crude oil has fallen below $49 a barrel, and is currently down 0.2% at $48.94. Prices are under pressure as hopes fade that oil producing countries will reach a deal to limit production, and on the latest evidence that stocks are rising in the US. US government data published on Thursday showed weekly crude stocks rose by 2.5m barrels to 523.59m. Analysts had expected the figures from the Energy Information Administration to show a 0.5m fall. The pound is coming under some pressure. It is down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.32, and down 0.5% against the euro at \u20ac1.1688. Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics says the strong UK retail sales reported by the CBI won\u2019t last as the impact of the Brexit vote starts to creep into the data: With labour market conditions likely to deteriorate and rising inflation set to undermine real wage growth, it would be fairly surprising if retail sales growth didn\u2019t slow at all in the aftermath of the leave vote. It shouldn\u2019t be too dire for retail sales though, she adds: We think that other supportive factors \u2013 including low interest rates \u2013 should prevent household purchases from slowing too sharply. What\u2019s more, the upbeat tone of the forward-looking indicators provide us with some reassurance that we\u2019re not likely to see a marked collapse in consumer spending ahead. There is no sign of Brexit uncertainty weighing on consumer confidence in the CBI\u2019s latest retail survey. Shoppers were encouraged to hit the high streets by the sunny weather, shrugging off any Brexit fears. Specifically, 35% of retailers said sales volumes were up in August compared with a year earlier, while 26% said they were down. It gave a balance of +9%, rebounding from -14% in July. It was far better than the -12% predicted by retailers. Anna Leach, CBI head of economic analysis says it\u2019s not all good news: The summer weather has brought shoppers out onto the high street with retailers reporting that sales growth has risen, outdoing expectations, although firms do expect sales growth to ease next month. While the fall in sterling has boosted visitor numbers to the UK, it is likely to push up the price of imported goods over time which will mean households will be more likely to rein back spending on non-essentials. And we\u2019re back... Guardian Towers is being evacuated following a fire alarm... we\u2019ll be back as soon as possible Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC markets, has this take on Thursday\u2019s share price falls across Europe: European healthcare stocks have been caught in the storm of another attack on price gauging in the industry from presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. Shire and Hikma Pharmaceuticals are amongst the top fallers on the FTSE 100 whilst Qiagen in Germany was a top faller in the Stoxx 600 Healthcare euro price index. The FTSE 350 Mining Index is off by over 2% from the open. Poorly-received earnings from Glencore on Wednesday and lower oil prices continue to weigh on commodity-sensitive shares. European equity losses are building this morning, driven lower by pharmaceutical stocks following comments by US presidential hope Hilary Clinton. Her comments about excessive price rises in the industry - with specific reference to Mylan raising the cost of allergy treatment EpiPens - are weighing on the sector. Clinton said it was \u201cthe latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers\u201d. She continued: ...it\u2019s wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve put forward a plan, hrc.io/2c7gjuI, to address exorbitant drug price hikes like these. As part of my plan, I\u2019ve made clear that pharmaceutical manufacturers should be required to explain significant price increases, and prove that any additional costs are linked to additional patient benefits and better value. Since there is no apparent justification in this case, I am calling on Mylan to immediately reduce the price of EpiPens. Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 index is down 1.14% at 341, with pharmaceutical companies among the biggest fallers: Carsten Brzeski, ING chief economist for Germany and Austria, says the weak August Ifo survey suggests German business confidence has been struck down by the Brexit vote. Oops. It seems that German businesses always take a bit longer to digest the news but today\u2019s Ifo suggests that German businesses have suddenly woken up to Brexit reality. Germany\u2019s most prominent indicator, the Ifo index, decreased sharply in August to 106.2, from 108.3 in July; the strongest monthly drop since May 2012. The drop was equally driven by decreases of both the current assessment and the expectations component. The expectations component is now at its lowest level since October 2014. What we had feared could happen did unfortunately happen: German businesses continued a longer tradition of delayed reactions to single and unexpected events. It is not the first time that the Ifo reacts with a delay of one or two months to global events. Today\u2019s Ifo reading is a good reminder that the relative benign reaction of Eurozone data to the Brexit vote should not be taken as given. The negative confidence impact is for real. Morale among German businesses weakened unexpectedly in August according to the latest Ifo survey. The headline business climate index, based on a survey of about 7,000 firms, fell to 106.2 this month from 108.3 in July. Economists had forecast a slight improvement to108.5. Clemens Fuest, Ifo head, said: Business confidence in Germany has clearly worsened. The German economy has fallen into a summer slump. Europe\u2019s major markets are all down this morning. It follows falls on Wall Street on Wednesday and in Asia on Thursday. Investors are feeling cautious ahead of Jackson Hole, and the recent drop in the oil price as hopes of an OPEC deal fade is also denting sentiment. FTSE 100: -0.7% at 6,790 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.8% at 10,538 France\u2019s CAC: -0.9% at 4,397 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.9% at 16,738 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.6% at 8,606 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.8% at 342 More than a million cars have rolled off production lines at UK factors since the beginning of 2016. The latest industry figures showed a total of 1.02 million cars were built in the first six months of the year. It was a 12.3% increase compared with the same period a year earlier. In July alone, the number of cars made in the UK rose by 7.6% to 126,566 vehicles. It was the 12th consecutive month of growth. Mike Hawes from the industry trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, says production is \u201cbooming\u201d with demand for British built cars from around the world. Manufacturers have invested billions to develop exciting new models and produce them competitively here in the UK. Future success will depend on continued new car demand and attracting the next wave of investment so Britain must demonstrate it remains competitive and open for business. There are concerns however that following the Brexit vote foreign car companies will be less willing to invest in UK car plants. The rise in production volumes in 2016 is the result of past investment so it will take a while for any Brexit effect to feed through to manufacturing numbers. Figures published this morning show French business confidence faltered in August. The French statistics office INSEE said the index for firms in the industrial sector dropped to 101 from 103 in July. The weaker confidence was most keenly felt among food and drinks manufacturers. The wider gauge of business morale also dipped to 101 this month from 102 in July. Confidence in the services sector was stable at 101. European markets are expected to open lower: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Central bankers and leading economists will arrive for the keenly anticipated Jackson Hole symposium which kicks off today with a reception and opening dinner. The full agenda for the meeting will be published at 6pm Mountain Time today (1am Friday in the UK). It should be available here. The main event of course will be the speech by Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve. She will be speaking on Friday at 3pm UK time. Investors will be listening closely for any hints on the timing of the next interest rate rise. There will be more clues on whether or not the Brexit vote has knocked confidence among UK consumers when we get the CBI\u2019s latest retail sales survey for August. Also today: The final estimate of Spanish GDP for the second quarter The German IFO business climate index for August In the US we will get jobless claims figures for last week, durable goods data, and the services PMI survey for August We will be bringing you all the key developments as the day unfolds.",

Her comments at Jackson Hole in the US on Friday afternoon will be scrutinised for hints about when the central bank could raise interest rates, with various analysts expecting her to be hawkish, dovish or neutral. With that uncertainty it is no surprise that investors have been erring on the side of caution. And after recent falls in the oil price, along with a drop in pharmaceutical shares following comments on excessive pricing by US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, stock markets ended the day in negative territory. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished 18.88 points or 0.28% lower at 6816.90</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.88% to 10529.59</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.65% at 4406.61</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.07% to 16710.78</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.65% at 8599.5</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.37% to 565.83</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently fairly stable, down just 6 points or 0.04%.</p> <p><em>On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening.

After appearances from Dudley and Fischer last week, today\u2019s input from voting member George adds yet another voice to the increasingly deafening push for a rate hike in the coming months. With the election looking unpredictable, the likeliness is that members will see December as the month to press the button once more, one year on from the contentious 2015 rise. It is hard to see Janet Yellen delivering anything other than a relatively hawkish outlook tomorrow [at Jackson Hole] and with the dollar having suffered heavily in recent weeks, tomorrow could be a turning point for foreign exchange markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bf0813e4b0568600c043aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T15:08:16.331Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another comment suggesting that the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers in the US could be a damp squib, despite expectations that Fed chair Janet Yellen could hint at future rate rises. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Investors continue to hold back from taking on additional market exposure ahead of tomorrow\u2019s speech from Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. Few expect the Fed Chairman to say anything explicit about the likelihood or timing of what would be the US central bank\u2019s first rate hike since December last year. Nevertheless, there are hopes that she may give some clues as to the Fed\u2019s thinking over the state of the US economy, and indeed any risks facing the global economy as well.</p> <p>Last week we heard hawkish rhetoric from three Fed members. Then on Sunday Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer provided an upbeat outlook for the US economy saying that he expected growth to pick up following a particularly weak second quarter. Not only that, but he said that the Fed\u2019s targets for inflation and unemployment (the dual mandate) were close to being hit. If Yellen is similarly upbeat in her speech tomorrow, then investors will price in an increased possibility of a September hike.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a50a3b0195a5e2b38fe60a4075ed6a990ed708ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a50a3b0195a5e2b38fe60a4075ed6a990ed708ae/0_329_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate outlook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate outlook</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>But despite all this chatter and speculation, it seems unlikely that Yellen will want to paint herself into a corner over the future direction of US monetary policy.</p> <p>Consequently, it could be that there\u2019s little of substance in the speech. While we\u2019ve had a clutch of Fed-heads out there trying to persuade investors that September is still \u201clive\u201d when it comes to a rate hike, the minutes from the last meeting in July showed that only one out of ten FOMC-voting members was in favour of tightening monetary policy. In addition, we\u2019ll get a stack of fresh economic data ahead of the Fed\u2019s next meeting, including Non-Farm Payrolls, Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs and inflation numbers. There\u2019s really no point in committing to any course of action until the Fed sees these reports.</p> <p>Finally, I don\u2019t believe that the FOMC has the faintest idea what they should do at the next meeting. And unfortunately we now have a central bank which pays too much attention to stock market movements and appears to relish its ability to influence short-term investor behaviour.</p> <p>Overall, I think there\u2019s just too much importance being attached to this speech. Jackson Hole was a fairly obscure event in years gone by. It only attained its current significance when Ben Bernanke used it as a forum for market manipulation in the wake of the 2008/9 financial crisis. It would be better for all if it went back to being a boring conference for boring people.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed5eca4865718fa53980560041b6321ab3353884\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed5eca4865718fa53980560041b6321ab3353884/0_225_1704_1021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The road to Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The road to Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finn Dempsey/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bef773e4b0568600c0434b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T14:33:27.015Z\">3.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the UK, and the strong retail sales figures from the CBI back up the idea that any negative effects of Brexit on the economy will only appear slowly, writes economic editor Larry Elliott:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/25/uk-retail-sales-brexit-slow-puncture-not-car-crash\">UK retail sales show Brexit effect will be more slow puncture than car crash | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57befc81e4b0fe30498a4aff\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T14:16:08.579Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US rates could rise shortly - Fed board member</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While we wait for Fed chair Janet Yellen on Friday, and any hints she gives on US interest rates, there is at least one board member of the US central bank suggesting a rise could be imminent.</p> <p>Speaking on CNBC, Dallas Federal Reserve president Robert Kaplan said the bank should be able to hike rates in the not too distant future, and the case for a rise was strengthening.</p> <p>He said progress was being made on employment and - more slowly - inflation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Accendo_Mike/status/768812018560303104\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fed&#39;s Kaplan on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBC\">@CNBC</a> I&#39;m focused on fundamental drivers;

      "bodyText": "Two major fund management firms have backed an influential shareholder group in publicly criticising corporate governance at Sports Direct and demanding change at the top of the retail group. Legal &amp; General Investment Management said it would be voting against the re-election of all Sports Direct\u2019s non-executive directors, including the chairman, Keith Hellawell, whom it has voted against for the past two years. Aberdeen Asset Management said it would also be voting against the reappointment of Hellawell, as well as chief executive Dave Forsey and acting chief financial officer Matt Pearson. Both shareholder groups said they would be supporting a trade-union-backed resolution that calls for an independent review of labour practices at the retail group, in the wake of a highly critical parliamentary report and an investigation by the Guardian. L&amp;G\u2019s move comes after the Investor Forum, a shareholder group with combined assets of \u00a314.5tn, ratcheted up pressure on Sports Direct by publicly criticising the retailer\u2019s corporate governance failings. It is the first time that the Investor Forum, set up two years ago, has aired concerns about a company in public. The group has 40 members and represents 27% of Sports Direct\u2019s independent shareholders, including L&amp;G, Aviva, Standard Life and Fidelity. \u201cGovernance failings are clearly resulting in declines in operating performance and long-term shareholder value,\u201d said the Investor Forum, deploring the lack of progress. It called for a clear plan of action to begin rebuilding the confidence of shareholders and others. Shareholders will have to consider how they vote at the retailer\u2019s annual general meeting on 7 September \u201cwith great care\u201d, the investor group said, after the sportswear chain was hit by a series of damaging revelations about the treatment of workers and its business practices. Sacha Sadan, director of corporate governance at L&amp;G Investment Management, which holds a 1% stake in Sports Direct, said it supported the Investor Forum stance and that \u201call shareholders should send a strong signal to Sports Direct calling for change\u201d. \u201cWe will be voting against the re-election of all non-executive directors, as we believe that Sports Direct needs a stronger body of independent non-executive directors to ensure the business is run in the interest of all shareholders. We are disappointed that there have been no new non-executive board appointments in the last five years.\u201d Aberdeen Asset Management, which owns less than 0.5% of the retailer\u2019s stock, said in a statement: \u201cLike many investors, we have been in dialogue with Sports Direct for some time. Its [AGM] is the latest formal interaction, and offers an opportunity again to press for constructive change. \u201cThe company\u2019s well-chronicled problems and [Mike Ashley\u2019s] comments to the select committee have highlighted the need to upgrade the senior management team. Sports Direct is a multimillion-pound business that would benefit from an injection of new talent with the skill sets required to run an enterprise of its size and complexity.\u201d For the first time this year, independent shareholders will hold real sway at Sports Direct\u2019s AGM, under new regulatory rules governing companies that have a controlling shareholder with a stake of 30% or more. In the past, founder and executive deputy chairman Mike Ashley, who owns a 55% stake, was able to outvote any detractors. But now the election of non-executive directors must be approved separately by minority shareholders. To go against their wishes, Sports Direct would be forced to hold another vote between three and six months later. While he could out-vote minority shareholders at that point, such a move would be highly contentious. In an effort to win over its critics, Sports Direct announced earlier this week that it would open its doors to the public on the day of the AGM, held in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. Andy Griffiths, the executive director of the Investor Forum, welcomed the plan for an open day but said the group had not received an \u201cappropriate level of commitment to respond to investor concerns and, as a result, the usual options have been exhausted.\u201d \u201cWe do not take this step lightly,\u201d he said. In July, it was announced that thousands of warehouse workers would receive back pay totalling about \u00a31m after the retailer admitted breaking the law by not paying the national minimum wage. A Guardian investigation last year exposed the fact that Sports Direct workers were being paid less than the legal requirement. The company and its employment agencies face fines of up to \u00a32m. The Investor Forum called on the retailer to carry out a \u201cwide-reaching independent review of the entire governance practices at the company\u201d, as recommended by a parliamentary select committee, not just its employment practices. It also called on Sports Direct to review corporate governance and board oversight and effectiveness, acquisition strategy and associated due diligence, and the oversight of key supplier relationships and the management of its store portfolio. The group said it did not regard the review of employment practices being carried out by RPC, Sports Direct\u2019s lawyers, as independent, echoing the views of other shareholders. The recently announced external board evaluation \u201cfails to reflect the breadth and magnitude of reform that is required\u201d, it said. On Monday, it emerged that Sports Direct pays a company owned by the brother of Mike Ashley to deliver online purchases to customers outside the UK. Britain\u2019s largest union, Unite, called on Sports Direct to tackle \u201cendemic abuses\u201d within its employment agencies and move longstanding agency workers on to direct, permanent contracts. Unite, which has been leading a campaign against \u201cVictorian\u201d work practices at Sports Direct, is urging shareholders to back the AGM resolution for an independent review into work practices. The Unite assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said: \u201cSports Direct has achieved a rare feat in uniting the City, politicians and Unite in the need to address deep-seated problems with its work practices and corporate governance.\u201d",

The group has 40 members and represents 27% of Sports Direct\u2019s independent shareholders, including L&amp;G, Aviva, Standard Life and Fidelity.</p> <p>\u201cGovernance failings are clearly resulting in declines in operating performance and long-term shareholder value,\u201d <a href=\"http://media.wix.com/ugd/1cf1e4_92f4632de08048fd8f551d92adc5158b.pdf\">said the Investor Forum</a>, deploring the lack of progress. It called for a clear plan of action to begin rebuilding the confidence of shareholders and others.</p> <p>Shareholders will have to consider how they vote at the retailer\u2019s annual general meeting on 7 September \u201cwith great care\u201d, the investor group said, after the sportswear chain was hit by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/22/mike-ashley-running-sports-direct-like-victorian-workhouse\">series of damaging revelations</a> about the treatment of workers and its business practices.</p> <p>Sacha Sadan, director of corporate governance at L&amp;G Investment Management, which holds a 1% stake in Sports Direct, said it supported the Investor Forum stance and that \u201call shareholders should send a strong signal to Sports Direct calling for change\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe will be voting against the re-election of all non-executive directors, as we believe that Sports Direct needs a stronger body of independent non-executive directors to ensure the business is run in the interest of all shareholders. We are disappointed that there have been no new non-executive board appointments in the last five years.\u201d</p> <p>Aberdeen Asset Management, which owns less than 0.5% of the retailer\u2019s stock, said in a statement:<strong> </strong>\u201cLike many investors, we have been in dialogue with Sports Direct for some time. Its [AGM] is the latest formal interaction, and offers an opportunity again to press for constructive change. </p> <p>\u201cThe company\u2019s well-chronicled problems and [Mike Ashley\u2019s] comments to the select committee have highlighted the need to upgrade the senior management team. Sports Direct is a multimillion-pound business that would benefit from an injection of new talent with the skill sets required to run an enterprise of its size and complexity.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time this year, independent shareholders will hold real sway at Sports Direct\u2019s AGM, under new regulatory rules governing companies that have a controlling shareholder with a stake of 30% or more. In the past, founder and executive deputy chairman Mike Ashley, who owns a 55% stake, was able to outvote any detractors. But now the election of non-executive directors must be approved separately by minority shareholders. To go against their wishes, Sports Direct would be forced to hold another vote between three and six months later. While he could out-vote minority shareholders at that point, such a move would be highly contentious.</p> <p>In an effort to win over its critics, Sports Direct announced earlier this week that it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/24/sports-direct-allows-public-to-attend-annual-general-meeting\">open its doors to the public</a> on the day of the AGM, held in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. </p> <p>Andy Griffiths, the executive director of the Investor Forum, welcomed the plan for an open day but said the group had not received an \u201cappropriate level of commitment to respond to investor concerns and, as a result, the usual options have been exhausted.\u201d \u201cWe do not take this step lightly,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In July, it was announced that thousands of warehouse workers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/15/sports-direct-staff-to-receive-back-pay-unite-hmrc\">would receive back pay</a> totalling about \u00a31m after the retailer admitted breaking the law by not paying the national minimum wage. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">Guardian investigation last year</a> exposed the fact that Sports Direct workers were being paid less than the legal requirement. The company and its employment agencies face fines of up to \u00a32m.</p> <p>The Investor Forum called on the retailer to carry out a \u201cwide-reaching independent review of the entire governance practices at the company\u201d, as recommended by a parliamentary select committee, not just its employment practices. It also called on Sports Direct to review corporate governance and board oversight and effectiveness, acquisition strategy and associated due diligence, and the oversight of key supplier relationships and the management of its store portfolio.</p> <p>The group said it did not regard the review of employment practices being carried out by RPC, Sports Direct\u2019s lawyers, as independent, echoing the views of other shareholders. The recently announced external board evaluation \u201cfails to reflect the breadth and magnitude of reform that is required\u201d, it said.</p> <p>On Monday, it emerged that Sports Direct pays a company owned by the brother of Mike Ashley to deliver online purchases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/22/sports-direct-pays-mike-ashleys-older-brother-international-delivery\">to customers outside the UK</a>.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s largest union, Unite, called on Sports Direct to tackle \u201cendemic abuses\u201d within its employment agencies and move longstanding agency workers on to direct, permanent contracts. Unite, which has been leading a campaign against \u201cVictorian\u201d work practices at Sports Direct, is urging shareholders to back the AGM resolution for an independent review into work practices.</p> <p>The Unite assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said: <em>\u201c</em>Sports Direct has achieved a rare feat in uniting the City, politicians and Unite in the need to address deep-seated problems with its work practices and corporate governance.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Drivers for Uber\u2019s food delivery service are planning a protest in the latest sign of discontent within the gig economy. UberEats riders will demonstrate outside the group\u2019s London headquarters on Friday after the company cut the amount it pays per delivery, which some drivers say leaves them at risk of earning less than the minimum wage. They are calling on the company to pay the independently backed London living wage of \u00a39.40 an hour. The action comes after more than 100 moped riders and cyclists took to the streets to protest against pay changes at rival food courier service Deliveroo, eventually seeing off an attempt to force them to accept new pay terms. UberEats drivers, who earned as much as \u00a320 an hour during peak meal times when the service launched in June, told the Guardian they are now earning less than \u00a310, even at peak times. Off peak, drivers earn \u00a33.30 per delivery, plus a mileage payment between the restaurant where food is picked up and the drop location, minus a 25% fee taken by UberEats. The changeable rates mean that some are at risk of earning less than the minimum wage over the course of a week, according to pay records passed to the Guardian. All drivers are self-employed, which means that they do not receive holiday or sick pay, or any hourly wage while they wait around for orders. Imran Siddiqui, a scooter courier at UberEats, said: \u201cAlthough they speak of \u2018flexibility\u2019 the bosses at UberEats have been cutting pay since day one. We\u2019re telling them we need the London living wage. I\u2019d like to ask them: where is the freedom in poverty wages? \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get by, but it\u2019s been a race to the bottom.\u201d Mags Dewhurst, the chair of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain couriers and logistics branch, which has been working with the delivery drivers, said: \u201cUber is becoming less and less rewarding to work for. It is reducing its rates during peak times as a response to piece rates. \u201cBy paying a piece rate, they are saying they only want to pay for work when they can make a profit out of it. They are saying work is only when someone is making a delivery, but people are providing a service to the company when they are standing around waiting for orders. Without that, UberEats wouldn\u2019t be able to function.\u201d On average, couriers take home more than the London living wage at meal times, UberEats said. Alex Czarnecki, the general manager of UberEats in London, said: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to being the best option for couriers in London. Unlike other companies, we don\u2019t set shifts, minimum hours or delivery zones. Couriers can simply log in or out when and where they choose. \u201cThis is why we\u2019ve seen hundreds of new couriers sign up in the last week alone. As UberEats grows, couriers are busier than ever. In fact, so far this week, couriers delivering lunch and dinner have made over 10% more an hour than they did in the same period last week. Our office is open and our team is always available to chat to couriers.\u201d At peak times, drivers now earn \u00a33.30 per delivery, plus a \u00a34 \u201cpromotion\u201d amount per job between 11.30am and 2.30pm, or a \u00a33 promotion between 6.30pm and 9.30pm, as well as the mileage payment. UberEats then takes a 25% cut. Drivers are upset as UberEats has been gradually cutting the promotion part of the fee as it takes on more people and becomes busier. UberEats said a driver would earn about \u00a37.60 for a peak time delivery if they travelled 1.5 miles. UberEats began recruiting delivery drivers this summer in an attempt to take on Deliveroo and grab a slice of the UK\u2019s takeaway food market. The San Francisco-based company, which began as a taxi-hailing app, initially offered a \u00a3100 signing-on fee to delivery partners, its term for bicycle and scooter drivers, to tempt them away from rivals. An ad campaign called get there with Uber sought to woo customers and drivers by suggesting that income from working for the company could help them start their own business. Uber\u2019s phenomenal growth has been met with opposition from traditional taxi services, leading to major protests and bans in some European cities. The company is facing a legal challenge from its drivers, who say they should be recognised officially as Uber workers, rather than counted as self-employed.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Brexit is pushing up the price of a bacon butty as China exploits the weak pound to hoover up British pork amid its own domestic shortage. China\u2019s farming industry has been devastated by severe flooding, which has forced suppliers to look further afield for their pork. The added demand from China has pushed up EU pork exports to the People\u2019s Republic by 60%, to reach 1.2m tonnes in the first six months of the year. Much of China\u2019s appetite has been sated by British meat exports, which have become cheaper for foreign buyers thanks to the weakness of sterling following the Brexit vote. The result has been a 40,000-tonne rise in pig meat exports, up 31% on the first half of last year. Some shop suppliers have raised their prices by up to 38%, according to purchasing company Beacon, causing price increases at the till of up to 19%, as supermarkets pass the cost on to consumers. It added that high prices would persist. \u201cThe combination of such huge demand for British pork from China and the devaluing of sterling following Brexit is impacting our breakfast tables,\u201d said Emma Warrington, a senior food buyer at Beacon. \u201cFigures from our butchery suppliers show the price of British bacon rising, in some cases substantially, with data from [butcher] Birtwistles showing that the spike in demand was equal to an additional 30,000 tonnes in the first six months of 2016. \u201cAll of this means we might be paying a higher price for a bacon sandwich for the foreseeable future.\u201d China\u2019s paucity of pigs has been caused by severe floods, which have affected millions of people and left pig farmers struggling to protect their livestock. The European farming industry has also felt the effect of flooding, which Beacon warned could pile on the misery for anyone who likes chips with their bacon butty. It said the floods had affected potato crop quality and quantity, which is set to drive up prices for chips and other potato products. Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union \u2013 and the subsequent drop in the value of sterling \u2013 has triggered a string of warning about the cost of goods, including supermarket produce, holidays and bottles of wine. The Consumer Prince Index measure of inflation reached 0.6% in July, the highest level in 20 months, with many economists saying the effect on inflation has yet to be felt in full. Some industries such as domestic tourism are reporting benefits as the weak pound makes the UK a more attractive place for foreign visitors. Swiss luxury watch firms have reported a boom in tourists buying timepieces in the UK. The most recent health-check on the state of the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector also lent some weight to claims that the weakness of the pound will prove a boon to exporters. Manufacturing exports rose to their highest level in two years in the three months to the end of July, according to quarterly survey data from the Confederation of British Industry. But economists have warned not to read too much into one export figure. The CBI said it was not all good news for UK firms that do business with overseas clients. The business lobby group said the currency effect was a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d, with manufacturers likely to feel the pinch as the cost of imported materials rises.",

      "bodyText": "There was a pick-up in housebuilding projects started in England in the run-up to the June referendum but a dip in the number of homes completed, prompting renewed calls for government action to address the housing shortage. Government figures show there were 34,920 homes completed in the April-to-June quarter, up 7% on the previous three months but down 2% on a year earlier. In the year to June, 139,030 homes were completed, an increase of 6% compared with last year. Housing charity Shelter said the figures showed housebuilding was falling well short of the 250,000 new homes it estimates are needed every year to address England\u2019s housing shortage. But there was a pick-up in the number of housebuilding projects started in the second quarter, helping to allay fears that June\u2019s EU referendum result had hit confidence and activity in the housebuilding sector. The number of builds started in England was estimated at 36,400 in the April-to-June quarter, a 2% increase on the quarter and a 6% rise on the year, according to the figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government. \u201cDespite the recent good news, it\u2019s clear from today\u2019s figures that as a country we\u2019re still falling far short of building the number of homes we need,\u201d said Roger Harding, director of communications, policy and campaigns at Shelter. \u201cShelter\u2019s own recent research shows that without significant reform to the housebuilding market the government is projected to miss its target of a million homes by 2020 by over a quarter.\u201d Shelter is urging Theresa May\u2019s government to use record low interest rates to invest in new affordable homes to rent and buy, and to help small builders access the land and finance they need to build. The communities secretary, Sajid Javid, highlighted the rise in new housing starts in the latest figures. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the country building again with more new homes started and built than this time last year,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is real progress but there is much more to do. That\u2019s why we are going further and increasing our investment in housebuilding to ensure many more people can benefit.\u201d There had been fears that the prospect of June\u2019s referendum and the outcome would hit housebuilding. Shares in housebuilders tumbled after the vote to leave the EU amid fears that falling consumer confidence and an economic slowdown would dent the housing market. But this week, shares in housebuilders were given a boost when Persimmon, the biggest company in the sector, said the Brexit vote had not put off potential homebuyers. Announcing first-half results, Persimmon said trading since the referendum had been strong and that after a short period of wariness customer interest had increased from a year earlier. Commenting on the government housing figures, Paul Smith, chief executive of haart estate agents, said: \u201cToday\u2019s data shows that despite all the claims in the run-up to the referendum campaign the construction of new homes remained steady in the second quarter. \u201cIt seems housebuilders were busy ploughing ahead with new sites despite the referendum noise, because the demand for new homes remained high. \u201cThe referendum result will test the nerve of housebuilders, but it\u2019s clear that since June the impact on economic confidence has been less than expected, with consumers continuing to spend and a housing market flatlining rather than falling.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If money talks, then one of the things it has been saying this summer is that investors are no longer interested in hedge funds. Investors withdrew $25.2bn from hedge funds in July, according to eVestments. This is the largest monthly redemption since February 2009, when investors redeemed $28.2bn. This news comes after investors withdrew $23.5bn in June. Overall, in 2016, hedge funds faced a net outflow of $55.9bn. According to Peter Laurelli, vice-president and global head of research at eVestments, 2016 could become the third year on record when investors took out more money than they put in. The main reasons why investors are taking their money elsewhere? Poor performance. \u201cInvestor redemptions from the industry continue to be driven by mediocre performance. Funds producing losses in 2015 are by far the primary source of outflows throughout the year into July,\u201d Laurelli wrote in his report. \u201cAdditionally, in both June and July, redemptions have accelerated from within funds producing losses in 2016. Funds reporting the 10 largest outflows in July have returned an average of -4.1% year to date, with average losses of -5.3% concentrated in the first quarter.\u201d Laurelli pointed out that some hedge funds were doing well \u2013 especially those who produced higher returns for their investors. \u201cThe 10 largest allocations in the last two months have gone to funds which have produced an average return of nearly 7% this year, and produced positive returns on average in 2015,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat we are forced to illuminate positive sentiment in the proverbial ashes, only illustrates the difficulty faced by many.\u201d In 2016 hedge funds have delivered returns of 1.2% industrywide, while S&amp;P 500 delivered returns of about 7.6%, according to Bloomberg. The trouble for hedge funds started in 2015, when over the last three months, investors globally withdrew more money than they put in, according to Hedge Fund Research. The research firm also reported that 979 hedge funds closed last year \u2013 most since 2009. The industry is expected to shrink further this year. According to Blackstone Group president Tony James, the industry might lose as much as 25% of assets this year. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a day of reckoning that we face here,\u201d James said during a May interview with Bloomberg TV Canada. \u201cThere will be a shrinkage in the industry and it will be painful. That\u2019s going to be pretty painful for an awful lot of places.\u201d BlackStone is the world\u2019s largest discretionary hedge fund investor. In the second quarter of 2016, the firm allocated $68.6bn to hedge funds. Despite the faltering performance and the varying investors, hedge fund compensation remains high. According to James, the hedge fund fees are \u201chard to justify these days\u201d. Hedge-fund managers typically charge a 2% management fee on the assets they manage as well as an incentive fee, which is usually 20% of the profits. Last year, the world\u2019s top 25 hedge-fund managers earned $13bn. That\u2019s more than the entire economies of Namibia, the Bahamas or Nicaragua. James is not the only one to voice displeasure over hedge-fund fees. Warren Buffett, world\u2019s third richest person, described the fees as an unbelievable compensation scheme. And Bill Gross, portfolio manager at Janus Capital, described the 2-and-20 fees as \u201ca giant ripoff\u201d. \u201cIf markets only provide 3% or 4%, they are taking more than half of the money that the investor gives them in terms of the annual profits,\u201d Gross told Bloomberg. \u201cThings have to change and people have to wake up [and realize] that it\u2019s a different world now.\u201d His comments came just days after that Tudor Investment, one of the oldest and most expensive hedge funds, informed its clients that it was cutting fees for one share class from 2.75% of assets and 27% of profits to 2.25% and 25%.",

Investors withdrew $25.2bn from hedge funds in July, according to eVestments. This is the largest monthly redemption since February 2009, when investors redeemed $28.2bn.</p> <p>This news comes after investors withdrew $23.5bn in June. Overall, in 2016, hedge funds faced a net outflow of $55.9bn.

Poor performance. </p> <p>\u201cInvestor redemptions from the industry continue to be driven by mediocre performance. Funds producing losses in 2015 are by far the primary source of outflows throughout the year into July,\u201d Laurelli wrote in his report. \u201cAdditionally, in both June and July, redemptions have accelerated from within funds producing losses in 2016.

      "bodyText": "Warmer weather and an influx of tourists helped retailers recover from their post-Brexit blues, but there are clear signs that sales are expected to slow in the autumn. The CBI distributive trades survey, a monthly health check of retailers and wholesalers, found that they enjoyed their best month in August for six months as shoppers bagged summer clothing bargains. The retail sales volume index rose to +9, its highest since February and a strong recovery from -14 in July. Anna Leach, the CBI\u2019s head of economic analysis, said sales in September were likely to moderate as the expected sales index could only reach +3 for next month, from -12 in August. \u201cThe summer weather has brought shoppers out on to the high street, with retailers reporting that sales growth has risen, outdoing expectations, although firms do expect sales growth to ease next month,\u201d she said. In a telltale sign of the outlook for the industry, the CBI said retailers had been consistently cutting orders to wholesalers for the past six months. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said last month\u2019s dive in the CBI index was out of line with the official figures from the Office for National Statistics, which showed retail sales leapt 1.4% month-to-month. \u201cThe survey\u2019s narrow scope \u2013 August\u2019s survey included just 58 retailers, who reported results only for the period between 27 July and 12 August \u2013 means it often gives a misleading steer,\u201d Tombs said. \u201cAway from the high street, there are clear signs that consumers are slowing down; falling new car registrations and declining mortgage approvals show households are shying away from big-ticket purchases. \u201cLooking ahead, we continue to expect growth in overall spending to slow sharply, as inflation picks up in response to sterling\u2019s depreciation and firms scale back hiring,\u201d he added. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said that although workers were still in a good position, with wages outstripping inflation and the jobs market remaining buoyant, the outlook was less rosy. \u201cThe concern is that the fundamentals for consumers will soften appreciably over the coming months, thereby weighing down on spending,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers are likely to face less favourable purchasing power as inflation rises and earnings growth is limited by companies striving to limit their costs. In addition, unemployment seems seem likely to rise over the coming months.\u201d",

The company reported revenue growth of 9.2% for the first six months of the year, or 3.8% at constant currencies, and a 42.6% increase in operating profits to \u00a325.3m. The second half had started well, the retailer said, with a positive benefit from a weaker pound. Jimmy Choo has 147 stores worldwide, including 10 in the UK, and is opening about 10 stores a year. It said only 9.5% of revenues were generated in sterling, while 28% of operating costs were denominated in sterling, \u201chence a weaker pound will lead to a reported upside in business performance at a revenue and profit level\u201d. While Jimmy Choo is known for its killer heels, made famous by the Sex and the City character Carrie Bradshaw, men\u2019s footwear, including its Grove loafers, has become the retailer\u2019s fastest-growing category. It now accounts for 8% of revenues, which is expected to rise \u201cwell into double digits\u201d. The company has 71 joint men\u2019s and women\u2019s stores globally. The retailer continues to expand in China, where its presence lags behind rivals, and enjoyed strong like-for-like growth in the first half of the year, while also recording growth in Hong Kong. Revenues rose by 22% in Japan. Other luxury goods retailers, such as Burberry, have been more dramatically affected by Chinese tourists cutting back on luxury spending. Tourist spending on luxury items has declined in Europe since the end of 2015, following a spate of terrorist attacks, Jimmy Choo said. Revenues grew in the UK, however, where all its stores have been refurbished. The company was founded in 1996 by the shoe designer Jimmy Choo and the then Vogue accessories editor Tamara Mellon.",

      "bodyText": "Pharmaceutical shares have come under pressure after new comments from US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton about excessive price increases. Specifically referring to Mylan raising the cost of allergy treatment EpiPens, she promised a clampdown on excessive charges: It\u2019s wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve put forward a plan..to address exorbitant drug price hikes like these. As part of my plan, I\u2019ve made clear that pharmaceutical manufacturers should be required to explain significant price increases, and prove that any additional costs are linked to additional patient benefits and better value. Since there is no apparent justification in this case, I am calling on Mylan to immediately reduce the price of EpiPens. The comments prompted fears among investors that companies would face a hit to their profits if Clinton became US president, and pushed down share prices of US drug companies overnight, with the Nasdaq BioTech Index down 3.37% and European shares subsequently following suit. Hikma is down 110p at \u00a321.18, Shire has dropped 4% to \u00a348.20, AstraZeneca losing 146.5p to 4933.5p and GlaxoSmithKline falling 27.5p to \u00a316.31. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:. European healthcare stocks have been caught in the storm of another attack on price gouging in the industry from presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. Shire and Hikma Pharmaceuticals are amongst the top fallers on the FTSE 100 whilst Qiagen in Germany was a top faller in the Stoxx 600 Healthcare euro price index. Hilary Clinton\u2019s attack on the price gauging of an allergy medicine is expected to continue to weigh on the healthcare sector. Biotechs especially, including the likes of Amgen, Biogen and Celgene can be expected to remain under pressure. Her statements reaffirm a fear in the industry that a Clinton presidency would see a serious crackdown on pharmaceutical price gouging. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: The healthcare sector is weighing heavily on the FTSE this morning (specialty pharma in particular) with the quartet of Astra, Glaxo, Hikma and Shire making up for over 35% (18pts) of the index\u2019s declines, enough to keep it below the key 6800 mark. This comes after US peers finished the day on the back foot thanks to fresh political disquiet about excessive and potentially unethical pricing of life-saving drugs, Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton demanding that generic and specialty pharma group Mylan lower the \u2018outrageous\u2019 price ($300; +500% over 6 years) of its allergy injection EpiPen. This echoes the populist swipe and US congressional challenge of Martin Shkreli, founder and former CEO of Turing Pharma which recently hiked the price of an Aids medicine by 5,000% overnight. It also serves to strike fear into the hearts of healthcare groups and their investors everywhere. As always, the industry remains between a rock and a hard place, treading the fine line between balancing the costs of clinical success (and failure) with the economic laws of supply and demand, all the while trying (often in vain) to satisfy demanding stakeholders without appearing to view the sick as merely a commercial opportunity.",

Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, said: \u201cUK car production in 2016 is booming, with new British-built models in demand across the world.\u201d He said manufacturers had invested billions to develop new models and produce them competitively in the UK. \u201cFuture success will depend on continued new car demand and attracting the next wave of investment, so Britain must demonstrate it remains competitive and open for business,\u201d Hawes said. Shortly after the EU referendum, the industry body warned that carmakers faced a skills shortage if the rights of people from the rest of Europe to work in the UK were restricted. The chief executive of Toyota Europe, Johan van Zyl, said the scale of the manufacturer\u2019s future presence in Britain would depend on the outcome of negotiations between the UK and Brussels.",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has warned that the economy risks falling into recession if Australians become too complacent. In the first of three major \u201cheadland\u201d speeches he plans to deliver on the economy, the treasurer said too much of the burden of reducing the government\u2019s deficit was falling on too few taxpayers, and on current settings more Australians were likely to go through their entire lives without ever paying tax than has been the case for generations. \u201cThere is a new divide \u2013 the taxed and the taxed-nots,\u201d Morrison said. Speaking in Sydney on Thursday, he said the new parliament had to get serious about reducing the debt position of Australia\u2019s state and federal governments, and restoring the budget to balance, so the country could have a chance of surviving future economic shocks. But he said deficits had \u201cproven difficult to shift in recent years\u201d because of the \u201cbudget sabotage engaged in by the opposition during the last parliament\u201d. The unwillingness of the previous Senate to help the government \u201cto implement our agenda for budget repair\u201d had also been a huge problem, he said. He then called on Labor, the Greens and new crossbenchers to help the government pass its proposed savings measures through the new Senate. \u201cI do not want my kids to know what a recession is and everything that goes along with that,\u201d Morrison said. Bill Shorten said Morrison needed to realise that the Coalition had actually won the election so he could get on with governing \u2013 rather than blaming others for the state of the federal budget. He said Labor had suggested $80bn worth of budget savings for the start of the new parliament and a fix for the Coalition\u2019s \u201csuperannuation issue\u201d, and if the government was serious about budget repair it should accept them, rather than pressuring low-income workers to pay more tax. Marking a different tone to the \u201cspending out of control\u201d message voters have heard in recent years, Morrison said the Coalition had expenditure in hand. As evidence, he said the 2013 pre-election fiscal outlook had estimated that government payments in 2015-16 would be $425bn, and three years later, in the 2016 Pefo, the estimated expenditure was the same, at $425bn. \u201cSince the 2013 Pefo, even in nominal terms, we have kept expenditure under control,\u201d he said. He also conceded that the commonwealth had a significant \u201cearnings problem\u201d \u2013 another name for a revenue problem \u2013 because since 2013 the country had suffered larger falls than expected in the terms of trade, commodity prices, wages and profits. \u201cOur nominal growth today is lower than our real growth, by a full percentage point,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an uncommon predicament and a core challenge in working to bring the budget back to balance.\u201d But he warned that this should not be an invitation to \u201cincrease the tax burden on the economy\u201d, especially on investment. \u201cThis is why we have consistently rejected Labor\u2019s tax-and-spend approach,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is, however, necessary to act to protect the revenue base from structural weaknesses, to ensure the base is contemporary and ensure that taxes are paid \u2013 as the prime minister said, taxes should be as low as they can be, but they must also be paid. \u201cThat is why we have introduced our tough new laws to crack down on multinational tax avoidance, including our new diverted profits tax introduced in the budget.\u201d Shorten criticised Morrison\u2019s speech on Thursday, saying the Turnbull government had to \u201cstop being unhappy\u201d since the election and get on with governing. \u201cThey won the election,\u201d he said. \u201cThey now need to start acting like a government.\u201d Oxfam Australia\u2019s chief executive, Dr Helen Szoke, said it was alarming that Turnbull government planned to \u201cdemonise\u201d the country\u2019s poor as the \u201ctaxed-nots\u201d, when one in three large companies reported on by the Australian Tax Office in 2014 paid no tax. \u201cLarge multinational companies are the real \u2018taxed-nots\u2019 in Australia,\u201d Szoke said. \u201cOur recent research found tax-dodging practices by multinationals deprived the nation\u2019s public coffers of as much as $6bn in 2014 alone.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Central bank governors are gathering at the fishing resort of Jackson Hole in Wyoming to discuss how they can dig themselves out of the monetary hole caused by the 2008 financial crash. The central banks have cut interest rates to zero and beyond, they have pumped trillions of dollars into the global financial system and devised novel ways to make sure most of the money is used to cut the cost of credit to ordinary consumers and businesses. The aim has been to boost growth and jobs at a time when governments of all colours have refused to ditch their austerity programmes and support productivity enhancing investment. Before the conference, deputy US Federal Reserve governor, Stanley Fischer, said monetary policy was not equipped to boost productivity growth. But governments have ignored the pleas of central bankers, leaving Fed boss Janet Yellen, the Bank of England\u2019s Mark Carney, Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank and Haruhiko Kuroda at the Bank of Japan to carry the burden. In Jackson Hole, Yellen, Carney\u2019s deputy Nemat Shafik and many others will debate how to piece back together the monetary system so it bears some resemblance to the one that existed before the crash. Under the title Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future, attendees will discuss the hurdles they must leap before they can achieve their stated aim. These include: Markets addicted to low rates Financial markets sank like a stone in the summer of 2013 when the Fed, believing the world had recovered from the Greek crisis the year before, hinted that it would begin to tighten monetary policy. The so-called \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d revealed that several major economies, including Turkey and Brazil, were still addicted to cheap debt after borrowing heavily in the US currency. They faced crippling interest bills if dollar interest rates went up. Last year the Fed was poised to try again but this was scuppered after the Chinese authorities bungled a depreciation of the yuan, triggering a stock market plunge. Such was the severity of the market reaction, the Fed only managed a 0.25% rise in December. Fischer said 2016 was fertile ground for another rise, possibly in September, but the huge volume of borrowing by governments and private corporations, especially among the emerging markets, Brexit, and the slowing US economy continues to make the Fed wary. Negative interest rates Kuroda recently said he would not rule out a \u201cdeepening cut\u201d to the country\u2019s negative interest rates. Draghi has followed the Japanese into negative territory, dragging the Swedish, Danish and Swiss national banks with him. Negative rates mean that commercial banks must pay to keep their funds on deposit with a central bank. The policy aims to encourage commercial banks to do other things with the money \u2013 lend it or invest it in riskier assets. But the effect has been to squeeze the gap between lending and borrowing rates, hitting bank profits. Even the Bank of England\u2019s recent interest rate cut to 0.25% is expected to hit the profits of high street lenders. Carney has vowed to avoid negative interest rates for just this reason and alongside the base rate cut to 0.25%, he set aside \u00a3100bn of cheap loans for the banks with the express aim of maintaining their profit margins. Stagnant eurozone Draghi is expected to release further funds later this year to boost lacklustre growth in the eurozone. The 19-member currency zone is trundling along with GDP growth just above 1% but this anaemic rate of expansion is unlikely to improve the dire jobs situation across much of the continent or push inflation closer to the European Central Bank\u2019s 2% target. Central bankers worry that for all Draghi\u2019s optimism, Europe is going to be on monetary life support for a generation, as the the wealthy baby boomers of Germany, France and Italy stash their savings rather than spend it. For every euro the boomers stash away or invest in property, the central bank will need to print two just for the economy to inch ahead. The latest figures show France beginning to recover and generate some private sector growth but with several countries still in recession and Greece ready to erupt at any time, the eurozone remains a a long-term problem Fragile emerging markets Brazil and Turkey are case studies in how strong emerging market economies can flip into recession, undermining the confidence among global investors that the recovery from 2008 is nearing completion. Brazil suffered from the knock-on effects of a slowdown in China, along with a string of domestic scandals, while Turkey found its corporate sector facing extra credit costs following its heavy borrowing in dollars. Both economies were roaring in 2013 at a time when the west was struggling, propping up global growth. Within a couple of years they were in recession while Russia and China\u2019s growth rate had slumped, leaving central banks to delay any return to normality. Currency wars Some central banks are frank about their determination to make exports more competitive by driving down the value of the local currency. Japan is a case in point. Kuroda was appointed by prime minister Shinzo Abe to fire two of the three arrows designed to rescue a stagnant economy \u2013 a cut in the cost of credit and a lower yen. A recent rise in the yen against the pound, the yuan and euro is likely to bring further monetary easing this year. Draghi, despite his denials, has embarked on the same mission at the ECB. Almost all the rise in Italian and French exports in the last couple of years can be attributed to a cheaper euro. In London the lower value of the pound was widely seen as a positive post-Brexit benefit, not least by the Bank of England. China has followed the same policy over the last year, sometimes clumsily, at other times without the world taking much notice. For all of them the target is the same: the US. They want to drive down the value of their currency to compete with American businesses, which have enjoyed a stellar recovery riding on the back of a cheap dollar. The fear is that a rise in US interest rates and the value of the dollar is not a step towards normality but a shock that will upset the applecart again.",

But governments have ignored the pleas of central bankers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/aug/22/what-central-bankers-really-want-read-janet-yellens-mind\">leaving Fed boss Janet Yellen</a>, the Bank of England\u2019s Mark Carney, Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank and Haruhiko Kuroda at the Bank of Japan to carry the burden.<br></p> <p>In Jackson Hole, Yellen, Carney\u2019s deputy Nemat Shafik and many others will debate how to piece back together the monetary system so it bears some resemblance to the one that existed before the crash. Under the title Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future, attendees will discuss the hurdles they must leap before they can achieve their stated aim. These include:</p> <h2>Markets addicted to low rates</h2> <p>Financial markets sank like a stone in the summer of 2013 when the Fed, believing the world had recovered from the Greek crisis the year before, hinted that it would begin to tighten monetary policy. The so-called \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d revealed that several major economies, including Turkey and Brazil, were still addicted to cheap debt after borrowing heavily in the US currency. They faced crippling interest bills if dollar interest rates went up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/aug/22/what-central-bankers-really-want-read-janet-yellens-mind\">What do central bankers really want? To read Janet Yellen's mind</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year the Fed was poised to try again but this was scuppered after the Chinese authorities bungled a depreciation of the yuan, triggering a stock market plunge. Such was the severity of the market reaction, the Fed only managed a 0.25% rise in December. <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-21/fischer-signals-2016-rate-hike-with-economy-nearing-fed-goals\">Fischer said 2016 was fertile ground for another rise</a>, possibly in September, but the huge volume of borrowing by governments and private corporations, especially among the emerging markets, Brexit, and the slowing US economy continues to make the Fed wary.</p> <h2>Negative interest rates</h2> <p>Kuroda recently said he would not rule out a \u201cdeepening cut\u201d to the country\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/negative-interest-rates\">negative interest rates</a>. Draghi has followed the Japanese into negative territory, dragging the Swedish, Danish and Swiss national banks with him. </p> <p>Negative rates mean that commercial banks must pay to keep their funds on deposit with a central bank. The policy aims to encourage commercial banks to do other things with the money \u2013 lend it or invest it in riskier assets.<br></p> <p>But the effect has been to squeeze the gap between lending and borrowing rates, hitting bank profits. Even the Bank of England\u2019s recent interest rate cut to 0.25% is expected to hit the profits of high street lenders.</p> <p>Carney has vowed to avoid negative interest rates for just this reason and alongside the base rate cut to 0.25%, he set aside \u00a3100bn of cheap loans for the banks with the express aim of maintaining their profit margins.</p> <h2>Stagnant eurozone</h2> <p>Draghi is expected to release further funds later this year to boost lacklustre growth in the eurozone. The 19-member currency zone is trundling along with GDP growth just above 1% but this anaemic rate of expansion is unlikely to improve the dire jobs situation across much of the continent or push inflation closer to the European Central Bank\u2019s 2% target.</p> <p>Central bankers worry that for all Draghi\u2019s optimism, Europe is going to be on monetary life support for a generation, as the the wealthy baby boomers of Germany, France and Italy stash their savings rather than spend it. For every euro the boomers stash away or invest in property, the central bank will need to print two just for the economy to inch ahead.<br></p> <p>The latest figures show France beginning to recover and generate some private sector growth but with several countries still in recession and Greece ready to erupt at any time, the eurozone remains a a long-term problem</p> <h2>Fragile emerging markets</h2> <p>Brazil and Turkey are case studies in how strong emerging market economies can flip into recession, undermining the confidence among global investors that the recovery from 2008 is nearing completion.</p> <p>Brazil suffered from the knock-on effects of a slowdown in China, along with a string of domestic scandals, while Turkey found its corporate sector facing extra credit costs following its heavy borrowing in dollars. Both economies were roaring in 2013 at a time when the west was struggling, propping up global growth. Within a couple of years they were in recession while Russia and China\u2019s growth rate had slumped, leaving central banks to delay any return to normality.</p> <h2>Currency wars</h2> <p>Some central banks are frank about their determination to make exports more competitive by driving down the value of the local currency. Japan is a case in point. Kuroda was appointed by prime minister Shinzo Abe to fire two of the three arrows designed to rescue a stagnant economy \u2013 a cut in the cost of credit and a lower yen. A recent rise in the yen against the pound, the yuan and euro is likely to bring further monetary easing this year.</p> <p>Draghi, despite his denials, has embarked on the same mission at the ECB. Almost all the rise in Italian and French exports in the last couple of years can be attributed to a cheaper euro. In London the lower value of the pound was widely seen as a positive post-Brexit benefit, not least by the Bank of England.</p> <p>China has followed the same policy over the last year, sometimes clumsily, at other times without the world taking much notice. </p> <p>For all of them the target is the same: the US. They want to drive down the value of their currency to compete with American businesses, which have enjoyed a stellar recovery riding on the back of a cheap dollar. The fear is that a rise in US interest rates and the value of the dollar is not a step towards normality but a shock that will upset the applecart again.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For the most part economic debate can revolve around the margins, with few bold ideas promulgated. This week however, Senator Nick Xenophon proposed a major shakeup to the way economic policy is run. He is proposing the Reserve Bank shift from its nearly quarter of a century policy of targeting inflation to instead targeting nominal GDP growth. It\u2019s an idea that deserves discussion if only to shake us out of the rut of the \u201cnew normal\u201d of low growth and low inflation. Firstly, a bit of history is needed. In the 1970s after two decades where inflation averaged 2.6% annual growth, prices took off while economic growth stagnated. In the 1970s and 1980s inflation growth average 9.3% annual growth. Not good. Most countries around the world were having the same problems, and the response was for central banks to target inflation rather than full-employment or economic growth. Interest rates were jacked up \u2013 in the USA in the early 1980s and here in the 1990s. It broke the back of inflation and it broke it across the backs of workers as deep recessions followed. But since the early 1990s, inflation has basically been kept in check \u2013 since March 1991 Australia inflation has averaged 2.5% \u2013 right smack in the middle of the RBA\u2019s target of 2%-3%: Inflation targeting was the solution to the problem of ongoing high inflation. But we are no longer in that world \u2013 the opposite in fact. The policy was also sold as being the key towards solid, stable growth. And it certainly worked \u2026 right up until the moment it didn\u2019t. Yes, during the 1990s and early 2000s there was low inflation, solid growth, and declining unemployment. And then the GFC hit here, and the northern hemisphere had The Great Recession. Enough to give you pause to consider that perhaps economic policies are not infallible. Senator Xenohophn\u2019s response this week has been to argue that the RBA should stop worrying about inflation, and instead should target stable nominal GDP. Now this is not a new idea. In the USA it has been doing the rounds since 2010 when economists such as Scott Sumner on his blog \u201cThe Money Illusion\u201d began talking up the idea. In Australia John Quiggin was writing on the idea in early 2012, and in February 2012, then ALP backbencher Andrew Leigh asked then RBA Governor Glenn Stevens about it during a House Economics committee hearing. We normally talk about \u201creal\u201d GDP when we talk about GDP growth \u2013 as that is the measure of the real change in economic output. Nominal GDP is just real GDP plus inflation. Those in favour of the idea argue that stable nominal GDP growth is a better measure of economic health than is stable inflation. Generally the target thrown about is 5%-6% annual growth \u2013 because that is roughly the sum of average inflation growth of 2.5% plus average output growth of 3%. But the big difference is when targeting nominal GDP growth you don\u2019t care how you get there. If output growth is 1% and inflation is 5% then in effect that is no better or worse than if output is growing by 5% and inflation 1%, as both would see nominal GDP growing by 6%. The reason nominal GDP targeting is favoured now is that our current nominal GDP growth is historically weak: Not only is it at levels you would normally associate with a recession, we are also in the very bizarre situation where real GDP growth is higher than the nominal growth rate \u2013 which means that the inflation measure used for GDP figures is negative \u2013 ie prices are falling. This goes to both the reason for nominal GDP targeting and the problem with it. The nominal GDP measure can get pretty erratic in Australia because it is influenced greatly by wild changes in our terms of trade. This is because, unlike the CPI, the GDP deflator (which is the inflation measures used in the GDP figures) includes changes in the prices of our exports as well as many non-consumer items. It makes for a much more jumpy measure of inflation: Were the RBA to target nominal GDP it would likely need to factor out much of those wild swings lest it be jacking up interest rates just because iron ore prices took a jump. Critics on nominal GDP targeting suggest that would in effect mean just using the CPI figure like they do now. A look over the past two decades suggests that the RBA\u2019s decisions on interest rates were not completely unconnected to nominal GDP growth: During the mining boom period while inflation remained below 3%, the RBA kept increasing interest rates. And after the GFC, they cuts rates in line with nominal GDP falling. The key difference is that during the mining boom interest rates would have be pushed higher, and it is likely they would be cut lower now. Critics of the idea \u2013 such as the AFR\u2019s Jacob Greber \u2013 suggest this would mean the RBA would be setting fire to the housing market and would more likely to lead to asset price bubbles. That certainly could happen, although had the policy been in place prior to the GFC, higher interest rates would have put a dampener on house price rises and the subsequent mad growth in household debt. But one key difference would be that changing the target from inflation to nominal GDP would put more pressure on the government to use its fiscal measures. One of the big problems with our current low nominal GDP growth and declining income growth (the ABS\u2019s measure of economic well-being) is that there is little sense of the government and RBA acting in sync: With the current policy, the worry is always that were inflation to rise due to fiscal policies, then the RBA would raise interest rates. Thus we had the absurd situation last year where then Treasurer Joe Hockey was claiming the RBA had \u201croom\u201d to cut interest rates because the Abbott government\u2019s spending cuts meant it \u201chad been able to control the inflation genie\u201d. He said this at a point when underlying inflation hadn\u2019t been above 3% for five years and nominal GDP was growing by just 1.3%. Targeting nominal GDP resets the conversation. Rather than having the government cutting spending (which reduces growth) in order to allow the RBA to cut interest rates to stimulate growth, both the fiscal and monetary arms could focus on improving growth \u2013 and it would put more pressure on the government rather than the current situation where it is leaving most of the work up to the RBA. Given government revenue has been hit due to the decline in nominal GDP growth, making that a focus would also assist with improving the budget balance. There are of course issues to consider. Firstly even acknowledging the GFC, our own economic performance under the inflation target has not been too bad, and the past 25 years have been historically excellent. But equally true is that since the GFC \u2013 over six years now \u2013 growth has been weak. It would take some getting used to \u2013 it would be odd to have the RBA cutting rates when inflation was running above 3% if output was less than 2%. But having to get used to something is no reason not to do it. After a quarter of a century of doing something it is tempting to stay in our rut and keep believing everything is fine and we\u2019re doing as best we can do. But we should remember the inflation targeting system was introduced to solve a problem that no longer appears to exist. There are a lot of things that looked good 25 years ago that are sadly out of date now. Senator Xenophon\u2019s call is worthwhile \u2013 and even if the RBA does not change its target it should spur a conversation about the effectiveness of our monetary and fiscal policies.",

But having to get used to something is no reason not to do it.</p> <p>After a quarter of a century of doing something it is tempting to stay in our rut and keep believing everything is fine and we\u2019re doing as best we can do.</p> <p>But we should remember the inflation targeting system was introduced to solve a problem that no longer appears to exist. There are a lot of things that looked good 25 years ago that are sadly out of date now. </p> <p>Senator Xenophon\u2019s call is worthwhile \u2013 and even if the RBA does not change its target it should spur a conversation about the effectiveness of our monetary and fiscal policies. </p>",
