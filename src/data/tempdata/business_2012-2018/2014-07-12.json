      "bodyText": "An airport in Hampshire will this week play host to politicians, airline executives and military officials from across the world as the global aerospace and defence industry meets to parade the latest commercial airliners, fighter jets and drones. Welcome to the Farnborough International Airshow 2014 \u2013 also a showpiece for British industry, with three of domestic manufacturing's biggest players, Airbus, Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, displaying their wares. For the public, the two-yearly event is a chance to see the Red Arrows and all the latest commercial and military jets \u2013 including, if all goes to plan, the first European flight of the F35-B Lightning II joint strike fighter, which has been grounded since one of the $135m planes caught fire on the runway last month. But the real business of the event, opening on Monday, will take place inside glitzy marquees along the runway, where defence company executives will press the flesh of politicians and army chiefs as they put the finishing touches to billions of pounds' worth of export deals. On the commercial side, airline executives will be wooed by manufacturers Airbus and Boeing, looking for multibillion dollar deals, while Rolls-Royce seeks sales for the engines that power the aircraft. \"Everyone wants to get deals done by the next day,\" says Tom Williams, Airbus executive vice-president and the company's most senior Brit. \"Real negotiations are taking place in all those little corridors \u2026 it's a very intense week.\" In 2012, the last time the event was held at Farnborough \u2013 it alternates with Paris \u2013 more than \u00a342bn of aerospace deals were announced. A similar amount is expect to be pledged this year. A sizable chunk of that cash will find its way to Britain as the UK underlines its prominent role in defence and aerospace, despite spending cuts across the world. For the British aerospace and defence, Farnborough is a shop window. \"Aerospace sustains high-value long-term jobs in the UK,\" says Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS, the aerospace and defence trade body. \"We help create a rich science base with the kind of high-skilled jobs that politicians dream about. Aerospace is unquestionably the Premier League of our manufacturing industries.\" British defence companies turned over \u00a322bn last year and, importantly to the government's need to rebalance the economy, defence exports amounted to \u00a39.8bn \u2013 up 11% on 2012. The UK now accounts for 22% of the global defence export market. Britain's commercial aerospace sector is an even bigger exporter than defence: 90% of the sector's \u00a328bn turnover comes from exports. The UK now accounts for 17% of the global aerospace market \u2013 in terms of manufacturing and R&amp;D \u2013 and is second only to the US. The industry is also a big employer of highly skilled, well-paid engineers, designers and researchers. More than 100,000 people are directly employed in UK aerospace, with tens of thousands more working indirectly in roles up and down the supply chain. BAE, the UK's largest defence company, employs 34,800 people in Britain: the company claims they generate revenue at a rate of \u00a3105,000 per employee \u2013 2.5 times the national average. Importantly for weaning the economy off its reliance on London, the vast majority of defence and aerospace jobs are located outside the capital. BAE assembles the Eurofighter Typhoon in Lancashire and built parts of the new HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier, which the Queen officially named this month, in Glasgow and Portsmouth. Rolls-Royce is another significant British player that will be prominent at Farnborough. It made the engines for the two Royal Navy QE-class aircraft carriers and key engine parts for the F35-B, the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Airbus A400M, which has the world's newest and most powerful propeller engine, as well as the engines for the A380 and the upcoming A350. It, too, is a big UK employer, with 12,000 staff in Derby and 3,500 in Bristol. Despite making some of the noisiest jets in the world, Rolls Royce's Bristol factory is quieter than a City office on a Friday afternoon as engineers methodically go about building and repairing engines that cost millions of pounds each. The quietness is maintained by the use of a double-skinned concrete bunker out the back for engine testing. Engines are also taken to the Sahara and the Arctic circle to check that they can operate at extreme temperatures, while at another facility (dead) Canada geese are fired at engines to check how they cope with bird strikes. At the back of the factory, which has been a Bristol landmark since 1966, white hoardings block off not just visitors but most of the workforce from the section where the lifting system for F35-B jets is being built. The unique technology allows the F35-B \u2013 the most expensive military project ever attempted \u2013 to hover just feet above the ground, and to land vertically on new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth. Bristol, which has been famous for engineering since Isambard Kingdom Brunel started building the Clifton suspension bridge in 1829, is a hot spot for UK aerospace. Airbus occupies 12 acres of design and research facilities at what was once Filton airfield \u2013 site of the first Concorde flight, in 1969. Franco-German-owned Airbus employs 4,000 people at Filton \u2013 designing aircraft, testing landing gear and making wings for the A400M. A further 6,000 Airbus staff are based at Broughton in north Wales, where the wings for the A380 superjumbo are made. Wings for the A400M \u2013 made from lightweight composites rather than aluminium to dramatically reduce weight and improve speed and manoeuvrability \u2013 are taking shape inside a nondescript hanger in Filton called 07N. Inside, machines that took five years to build and cost \u20ac10m each are slowly drilling 12,000 holes into each A400M wing, mainly for attaching covers to the structural ribs and the leading and trailing edges. This kind of painstaking, state-of-the-art work ultimately yields multibillion deals for the likes of Airbus, Rolls-Royce and BAE at Farnborough. John Allen, head of Airbus's component delivery team for wings, explains that the margin for error of the drilling is \"plus or minus a thousandth of an inch\". Airbus's civilian jets will be the main focus at Farnborough, when it is expected to announce plans to upgrade its widebody A330 jet to be 14% more fuel efficient. The new version, dubbed A330neo, is expected to be powered by a new Rolls-Royce engine that will increase its range by 400 nautical miles. Airbus's Williams, is keeping stumm on the A330 plans and will only say that \"a lot of negotiations are still ongoing\". Williams says Farnborough has become the focal point for negotiations that may have taken months or even years to hammer out. While many of the deals have been agreed in advance and are saved for announcement at the show, others are \"done right up to midnight in conference rooms\" and inside Airbus's tent on the Farnborough grounds. He says Farnborough also helps serve as a reminder to the British public that aerospace is one of the last areas of manufacturing at which the UK excels: \"The UK is the number two player, beaten only by the US. It's something the UK can be undeniably proud of \u2013 lots of other economies around the world look on with envy.\" He adds that the UK's place at the heart of this global industry is thanks partly to recent political commitment. \"The government has been extremely proactive at working with industry to come up with a very significant strategy.\" Industry and government have pumped \u00a31bn into creating a UK Aerospace Technology Institute as part of the 15-year Aerospace Growth Partnership (AGP) plan. And aerospace is taking a lead in encouraging young people to enter the industry: Airbus runs the biggest apprentice trainee scheme in the country with 450 people signed up in the UK. Williams, who began his career as a Rolls-Royce apprentice, says encouraging young people, and particularly girls, to take more of an interest in science and mathematics is one of his key roles. However, at the Filton plant there is one female apprentice this year (there were none at all last year) and of 45 graduate trainees, just eight are women. A phalanx of government ministers \u2013 including business secretary Vince Cable, business minister Michael Fallon, science minister David Willetts and defence secretary Philip Hammond \u2013 are due to speak at or attend the show, and David Cameron is expected to put in an appearance on Monday, although the government declined to confirm his attendance because of security concerns. Cable describes UK aerospace as a \"global success story\" helping to drive the current economic recovery: \"Our industrial strategy is ensuring that Britain is well-placed to capitalise on the huge growth anticipated in the aerospace sector, securing highly skilled jobs for the UK and a strong economy.\" Williams hopes renewed government interest in the sector, and the diversification of Britain's skills base, will help change the public's perceptions of manufacturing and engineers. \"People have this perception that industry is all about dark satanic mills with floors covered in dust and dirt,\" he says. \"But when you visit the building where we build the wings [for the A380 in Broughton] you will have to put on a white hat and go inside a giant vacuum cleaner to remove the dirt from you before you'll be allowed in.\" Next weekend, Farnborough opens to the public, and the government will be hoping that schoolchildren will leave just as impressed as the politicians, airline executives and defence staff.",

      "bodyText": "As the UK's former drugs tsar, Keith Hellawell knows a lot about addiction. He took a hard line on hard drugs and, despite being more lenient on cannabis, he resigned when the drug was reclassified as less dangerous. Still, his views on billionaires who might be addicted to trousering ever-expanding pots of wealth look more benign, at least judging from his tenure as chairman of Sports Direct. After three failed efforts by the retailer to satisfy the cravings of founder and largest shareholder Mike Ashley for more shares, Hellawell and his board have finally succeeded in finding a way to give the boss his fix. Earlier this month they pushed through a controversial multimillion-pound bonus scheme \u2013 plenty of which will accrue to Ashley, though others will benefit \u2013 despite fierce opposition from shareholder lobby groups. We may get a few clues this week about how the firm is limbering up for the start of this scheme \u2013 which will kick off next May \u2013 when the retailer reports full-year results. Analysts at Jefferies reckon the company and its other shareholders can move on \u2013 even though the firm could have chosen to pay all shareholders a dividend. It has never been explained why a plan to hand a few more shares to a man with a 64% stake will be motivational. Sometimes you do wonder what these chaps have been smoking. Laughs are for real in latest Keystone caper Think of the Keystone Cops, the incompetent policemen from early 20th-century silent films, and you might conjure up images of a few comedians arriving at speed to some crisis and immediately falling over. Think of their half-namesake \u2013 Gulf Keystone \u2013 and you probably think of much the same. The main difference is that the Kurdistan-focused oil company is funny. There will be another screening of some of the company's greatest skits on 17 July when shareholders gather for the annual general meeting. To recap: a year ago, founder Todd Kozel attempted to face down efforts by outside investors to elect four non-executive directors to the board. They included Middle East oil specialist John Bell and former director Jeremy Asher, who had been described as a \"disruptive presence\" when he last served on the group's board. In true Keystone style they were appointed anyway, only for both to step down last month \u2013 when it was also announced that Kozel would retire as chief exec. That news coincided with a 40% hike in the shares, only \u2013 again in true Keystone style \u2013 they've fallen over again since. Worth watching. Peace's suite of three chairs reduced to two Peace is breaking out at Experian. Well, Sir John Peace is. The group's longstanding chairman \u2013 who finds this City lark so effortless that he also has time to chair two other FTSE companies \u2013 is finally stepping down from the credit checking group this week, which must represent something of a wrench. Peace spent most of his career at the old retail group Great Universal Stores, where he co-founded what would later become Experian. After becoming GUS's chief executive in 2000, he split the company into three separate listed businesses: the owner of Argos, Home Retail Group; the luxury goods brand Burberry; and Experian. He chaired Burberry as well as Experian. Still, a cut in his workload looks timely. You may have noticed (and can read elsewhere on this page) how he's been having an absolute shocker of a time at Burberry, where he comprehensively misread investors' views about the pay of new chief executive Christopher Bailey. At Standard Chartered, where Peace is also chairman, he has been in similar form: at another damaging rebellion in May, 41% of shareholder votes opposed the bank's pay policy. It seems apt, then, that Peace should now check out of Experian. Its motto? A world of insight.",

      "bodyText": "The woman in charge of Marks &amp; Spencer's internet presence back in September 2012 was quite sure what was holding back online sales: its website, which had been run for it by Amazon under a deal signed in 2005. The M&amp;S director in question, Laura Wade-Gery, said: \"Amazon sells everything as if it was a book. We've tortured their system to do what we want it to do.\" The retailer began building its own and in February 2014 M&amp;S unveiled a new \"magazine-style\" site, which drew plaudits from some reviewers. But as well as early reports of crashes, customers apparently felt that there was too much video, that they couldn't find what they wanted, and that the site was \"awkward to navigate\". So last week M&amp;S knew what to blame for the news that online sales had fallen 8% in three months: its website. Finance director Alan Stewart bravely insisted that \"It is a bit like going to the supermarket for milk, they've moved it and you can't find it immediately.\" But an 8% drop would never happen at an internet business such as Amazon, because it would have spotted it at 1% or 2% and rolled back to a better-performing version. So how can two years of effort by one of Britain's biggest companies produce something that fell so short? According to people in the industry, it is probably because the process took two years. The more monolithic a computer project becomes, the less likely it is to withstand the continual shifts in the way that we use the internet. \"For M&amp;S, the fact that it took them 18 to 24 months means whoever did the project planning was two years behind the curve,\" says David Hamilton of Dog Digital, a media services company that has built websites for private and public sector clients. \"In our world, it's about agile development \u2013 designing, failing fast, optimising. You don't go for a 'ta-daaaa!' event.\" The biggest sites, such as Facebook or Amazon, are changing all the time, Hamilton points out \u2013 yet they never promote the fact, and the incremental, small nature of the changes makes them hard to spot. But that also means that if a tweak fails \u2013 which can easily be measured via statistics such as sales conversions or time spent on the site \u2013 then it can be abandoned and the site returned to how it was. It's very often public sector projects that fail badly. Last year, the Obama administration was severely embarrassed when the political triumph of implementing healthcare for all was undermined by a website that crashed repeatedly and suffered security glitches. In the UK, the Department of Work and Pensions' efforts to implement universal credit were so catastrophic that a \"tiger team\" of programmers was sent in by Francis Maude's Cabinet Office to implement a version that would work for the majority of claimants, rather than trying to cover every case. Yet private sector sites can fail badly too. The canonical example is boo.com, a would-be sports clothing retailer from the first dotcom boom of the 1990s, which built a fabulously complex site able to fulfil orders in a dozen European countries. It offered animations, 360-degree views of clothes and shoes and a virtual shop assistant. But its Swedish founders overlooked the fact that the vast majority of people had dial-up connections and comparatively slow computers \u2013 meaning the front page alone could take minutes to load. The company closed after burning through many millions of pounds. The key problem is that the ground has shifted radically since M&amp;S embarked on its change. In September 2012, fewer than 60% of Britons had a smartphone. Now that figure is over 70%. It's no longer just about online shopping, as it was in 2012. Now it's about mobile shopping. Even among the over-55s, more than one in four now own a smartphone and 61% of those people use it to compare prices, according to Kantar researchers. For the young buyer that M&amp;S wants to attract, the focus has shifted from the mobile web to apps \u2013 a category that was significantly smaller in 2012. If you're out and you want to order something, you can fire up a store-specific app. While M&amp;S does have an app for iPhone and Android, it has received poor reviews since it was updated in March, with complaints about usability. And who's to say that in another year or two the way that people use their smartphones won't have changed again? Retailers already complain about people \"showrooming\" \u2013 visiting their shops, looking at items and then seeing if they can buy them cheaper online. Amazon is looking to accelerate that with a feature in its new Fire Phone that can identify an object, a picture or a snatch of video via the camera, and show you the item on Amazon \u2013 where of course you can order it instantly. \"The biggest issue most organisations have is their culture from the boardroom down,\" says James Stevenson, managing director at digital consultants Bletchley Group. \"They specify their requirements, and then one, two or three years later feel pleased they have delivered it only six months late and only 15% over budget. Of course they miss that what has been delivered is already out of date, and no longer what their customers wish.\" The internet age requires a whole new way of thinking about selling products, says Stevenson. \"Too many organisations still think in 'projects', when the reality of business is that these are actually digital products, and need to be managed as such over the lifetime of the digital product.\" But he sees positive signs inside M&amp;S: \"They have started a new way of working and organising themselves, into digital product teams, and are working on being customer-focused and more agile.\" The company's latest results are the outcome of the old ways, he says. \"I'd be optimistic they will see the results of this very soon.\"",

      "bodyText": "One of Britain's biggest companies has been accused of \"blackmail\" by a Ugandan MP spearheading tough new anti-smoking laws in his country. British American Tobacco, in conjunction with other leading tobacco companies, is using its considerable financial clout to oppose Dr Chris Baryomunsi's private member's bill aimed at curbing smoking in a country where cigarettes kill 13,500 people a year. Anti-tobacco campaigners see the bill as a watershed moment with significant consequences for cigarette companies. En\u00f3 Isong, associate director, International Communications Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said European tobacco companies could not countenance a decrease in smoking rates in Africa. \"Most western countries have put in place policies to blunt the tobacco industry,\" he said. \"It is very clear that the tobacco industry is shifting its market to Africa \u2013 a young market where they can bully their way around.\" In a letter to Baryomunsi, BAT Uganda confirmed that it will no longer do business with the 709 farmers in his Kihihi constituency that it normally buys from because his bill \u2013 and a related plan to raise tobacco taxes \u2013 has rendered the arrangement \"increasingly less economically viable\". BAT, which has a stock market valuation of $65bn, buys tobacco from 18,000 farmers in Uganda and Baryomunsi said he was under no illusions about why the company had targeted the farmers in his district first. \"Although they said it was a business decision, the reason was merely blackmail,\" Baryomunsi said. \"They thought that the farmers would rise against me and disorganise me politically, but I told them I was not moved. I actually assured them that what mattered to me was not the number of years I spend in parliament but what I do when in parliament. I assured them that no amount of blackmail and intimidation would shake me.\" Baryomunsi's bill will impose large health warnings covering 75% of the face of cigarette packets, bar smoking within 100 metres of public buildings, prohibit advertising, ban point of sale display marketing, raise the smoking age from 18 to 21 and limit interaction between the government and tobacco lobby. But tobacco farmers' groups, backed by tobacco lobbyists, have reacted with fury to the plans, claiming the measures will put them out of business. Documents seen by the Observer show that BAT has mounted a heavy lobbying campaign, warning MPs on the country's health committee that replacing the existing Tobacco Act threatens the livelihoods of thousands of farmers. \"Currently an estimated 60,000 farmers grow tobacco in Uganda under the sponsorship of licensed tobacco companies which are obliged to purchase the crop, hence providing a ready market,\" the company warns them in a letter. \"Repeal of the Tobacco (Control and Marketing) Act and Regulations would not only threaten the livelihood of these farmers but also the revenues generated and investments made in this part of the sector by tobacco companies.\" In March, Senegal introduced new anti-smoking legislation and Baryomunsi predicted other African countries would soon follow suit. \"My bill is quite comprehensive and once passed will revolutionalise the fight against tobacco in Africa,\" Baryomunsi said. \"The bill has the support of Ugandans. It is only the [tobacco] industry that is spearheading this opposition voice. There are some provisions that have attracted debate, maybe I will concede on some of the proposals in the bill, but definitely the bill will have to pass without being severely watered down.\" Rachel Rose Jackson, of the tobacco tactics team at the Tobacco Control Research Group at the University of Bath, accused BAT of double standards. \"BAT wants us to believe that it is acting responsibly and transparently and it repeats this message to the public over and over again. In fact, the company is acting in violation of its mandates and international codes and regulations. In Uganda, some of BAT's activities include actively trying to attract children and women to its products; using its political influence and economic power behind the scenes to stall tobacco legislation; and fostering a system of credit bondage whereby tobacco farmers are continually indebted to the company.\" BAT rejected the accusations and said that it was acting legitimately to defend the livelihood of farmers. \"It can't be underestimated how important tobacco growing is to farmers in Uganda,\" the company said in a statement. \"Many depend on tobacco growing to feed and house their families, and pay for children to attend school. If Ugandan tobacco leaf becomes uncompetitive abroad, we have to look at other options. Regrettably, the uncertainty in Uganda, which may make it unnecessarily costly for us to source tobacco from there, has forced us to review our tobacco growing operations in Kihihi.\"",
