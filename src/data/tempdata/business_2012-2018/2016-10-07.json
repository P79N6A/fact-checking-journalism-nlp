      "bodyText": "Just after midnight in the UK on Friday morning, when most of Europe was asleep, foreign exchange dealers in Asia were jolted out of their routine contemplation of the currency markets by a sudden, inexplicable plunge in the value of the pound against the dollar. The UK currency had been under renewed pressure since Sunday, when Theresa May said she would trigger article 50 by next March and hinted at a hard Brexit \u2013 putting immigration controls at the forefront of EU discussions at the expense of remaining in the single market. With investors worried about the subsequent outlook for the UK economy, the pound had already dropped to a new 31-year low. But at 7.07am Hong Kong time on Friday, when traders were just starting work and little business is usually done, sterling suddenly fell off a cliff. It dropped more than 8% from $1.26 to $1.1491 in just eight minutes \u2013 a huge plunge in a market where a single cent is a big change. Dealers said there were only a small number of trades, possibly just a few hundred, made during that time. At one point the fall looked even worse, down 10% to $1.1378, before the cancellation of what was said to be a rogue trade. Even so, the slump was undeniably the worst one-day drop since the 10% fall in the immediate aftermath of the result of the Brexit vote in June. After several minutes of chaos on the trading floors, a semblance of calm returned and buy orders started to come in. Just 30 minutes later the pound had recovered to $1.24, but shell-shocked traders were scrambling to find a reason for the sudden \u201cflash crash\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve been trading the pound since 1978 through every crisis it has seen, and I\u2019ve not seen anything like this,\u201d said Ian Johnson, a foreign exchange strategist at financial analysis firm 4Cast. Naeem Aslam, the chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: \u201cWhat we had was insane. Call it a flash crash, but a move of this magnitude really tells you how low the currency can really go. Hard Brexit has haunted sterling.\u201d The falls will have hit both investors and companies. Sports Direct issued a profit warning on Friday afternoon, saying the overnight flash crash had cost the company \u00a315m, or 5% of its annual profits. . It was not long before theories began to emerge. The most popular was that computer-driven algorithmic systems \u2013 known as algos \u2013 were the cause because they are programmed to sell the pound on negative Brexit headlines. According to this theory the algos had picked up on a report in the Financial Times quoting the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, as saying that Britain would have to suffer for the Brexit vote in order to ensure EU unity. Kathleen Brooks, the research director at the financial betting firm City Index, said: \u201cApparently it was a rogue algorithm that triggered the sell off \u2026 These days some algos trade on the back of news sites, and even what is trending on social media sites such as Twitter \u2013 so a deluge of negative Brexit headlines could have led to an algo taking that as a major sell signal for the pound. \u201cOnce the pound started moving lower then more technical algos could have followed suit, compounding the short, sharp, selling pressure.\u201d The FT said its report was published seconds after, rather than before, the pound\u2019s fall began. Even so, many prominent City figures believe computerised trading was behind the fall, with programs called Cowpox and Triple Threat mentioned as possible instigators of the slide. Earlier there had been speculation that the fall was due to a \u201cfat finger\u201d trade, where a dealer types an incorrect figure into their terminal, which could also have set off the computerised sell programmes. Dealers pointed out, however, that such trades would have since been cancelled if that were the case. Others said the fall may have been linked to a technicality, the expiry of foreign exchange options on Friday, with banks hedging their exposure to anticipated currency movements. On top of that, major institutions often have instructions in place to sell investments if they fall below a certain level, and some of these so-called stop-losses could have been triggered by the sudden plunge in the pound. A definitive answer may never emerge, because the foreign exchange market has no central trading system, which makes it difficult to track deals. The Bank of England, which had already been on alert for the impact of computer trading on markets, is investigating. It said: \u201cWe are looking at the causes of the sharp falls overnight,\u201d and later added it had asked the Bank for International Settlements \u2013 which represents the world\u2019s central banks \u2013 to look into what prompted the flash crash. Sterling struggled to regain ground during the day, but recovered to $1.2461 after worse than expected US employment figures hit the dollar. Analysts expect the currency to remain under pressure thanks to the uncertainty around Brexit \u2013 and they said another sudden drop was not out of the question. Brooks said: \u201cThis highlights the drawback of machines making trading decisions. However, it is the reality, and it is only getting more popular. Thus, another flash crash is possible. If there is , the pound is vulnerable because such unstable forces are driving it.\u201d Sean Callow, a senior currency strategist at Westpac, said that sterling had been on a precipice since May\u2019s speech at the Conservative party conference. \u201cI think we\u2019ve underestimated how many people had money positions for a very wishy-washy Brexit, or even none,\u201d he said. Speaking in Washington, the British chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: ,\u201cIt has taken us a little while to persuade the markets and investors that Brexit will happen. This week the final foot dropped. Those who thought it is not going to happen have taken on board that it is going to happen.\u201d Hammond said he did not expect market turbulence to drive the pound consistently lower. Accepting that there would be \u201cbumps in the road\u201d during the negotiations, he said the currency would have ups and downs as people weighed up the opportunities as well as the costs of leaving the EU. The HSBC strategist David Bloom said he expected the pound to fall to $1.10 and to parity with the euro by the end of 2017. Analysts at the Japanese financial group Daiwa were more pessimistic: \u201cSterling\u2019s all-time low against the dollar was $1.05. If the government keeps careering headlong into a hard Brexit, a return to those lows is not unimaginable.\u201d So bad news for sterling, and holidaymakers, with or without another flash crash.",

      "bodyText": "Betting firms and broadcasters have lashed out against the prospect of a ban on betting adverts on daytime TV, amid reports the government is planning a crackdown to protect children and problem gamblers. The two industries voiced their criticism as figures revealed that gambling firms\u2019 spend on TV advertising has more than doubled since 2012, reaching \u00a3162m already this year. The government is understood to be planning to include gambling adverts in an imminent review of the industry that will also investigate the spread of Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) \u2013 dubbed the \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d of gambling by campaigners. The threat that the flow of advertising cash could be staunched hit shares in ITV, Ladbrokes and William Hill on Friday. But the Remote Gambling Association (RGA), whose members include Ladbrokes, William Hill and Paddy Power Betfair, said there was no need for a new investigation. The trade body said a review by the Department of Culture Media and Sport last year concluded there was no evidence for a ban on daytime TV ads. \u201cAll the evidence was considered and it was deemed there wasn\u2019t significant evidence to make a change of that kind,\u201d said RGA chief executive Clive Hawkswood. \u201cWe would never say things can\u2019t be improved but what\u2019s the justification? Some people have a gut reaction and that\u2019s slightly hard to deal with.\u201d The Advertising Association, whose members include broadcasters ITV, Channel 4 and Sky, also denied there was any reason to ban daytime gambling ads. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for people to propose advertising bans when they\u2019re looking to make a point,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cWe are open to the conversation and anyone putting new evidence around advertising gambling. Yes, advertising around online gambling has grown significantly but that hasn\u2019t flowed through to any significant increase in problem gambling.\u201d Figures compiled by resesarch and analysis firm Nielsen for the Guardian show that broadcasters have raked in \u00a3162m from gambling TV spot ads already this year, compared to \u00a3118m last year. This year\u2019s figure has been inflated by ads linked to the Euro 2016 football tournament. But with two and a half months of the year still to go, the figure far oustrips the \u00a381m spent in 2012, the year of the last European Championships. A spokesman for ITV said it already had \u201cstrict controls\u201d in place to govern the content of gambling advertising. It said children aged between 10 and 15 see an equivalent of only 42 seconds of gambling ads out of 17 hours spent watching TV per week. Existing rules only allow such adverts before the 9pm watershed or during live sports events, which dominate weekend coverage on some channels. But the effect that the increase in ad spending has had on the prevalence of problem gambling is a matter of dispute. The Gambling Commission\u2019s quarterly figures show the problem gambling rate nearly doubled from 0.4% of the population to 0.7% between June 2013 and June 2016 and jumped from 0.7% to 1.5% among 16- to 24-year-olds. But the commission\u2019s more comprehensive health survey suggests problem gambling rates were similar in 2012 to the latest quarterly figures. The next survey won\u2019t be released until next year. Gambling addiction campaigners said an increase in TV adverts risked luring in children who are yet to show up in figures documenting problem gambling. \u201cAdvertising normalises gambling and encourages young persons to engage in the activity,\u201d said Derek Webb of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, which lobbies for curbs on FOBTs (fixed odds betting terminal), a type of electronic gaming machine. \u201cFootball advertising is getting 18-year-olds and even younger teenagers into betting shops. They are then converted by shop staff into addictive FOBT gambling through free credits, tournaments and how-to-play sessions.\u201d Gambling minister Tracey Crouch proposed measures to curb spending on FOBTs, which allow people to stake \u00a3100 every 20 seconds. But the plan was overruled by former chancellor George Osborne, whose family has made \u00a348m from the gambling industry according to the Times, which first reported the prospect of a ban on daytime gambling ads. The government\u2019s triennial review of gambling will also look at the use of social media to promote gambling and the impact that has on children, the newspaper reported. Industry sources cast doubt on the prospect of a ban, saying the Department for Culture Media and Sport was mystified by reports the government was considering such a move. A DCMS spokesperson said: \u201cWe will continue to monitor the effectiveness of existing gambling controls and will take further action if necessary.\u201d But stock market traders sold shares in companies they thought would be affected if the proposals become reality. Shares in William Hill were down nearly 4% while ITV lost 4.6% and Ladbrokes lost 5% of its stock market value. Scrutiny of gambling adverts has intensified amid a succession of payouts by firms found to have failed to prevent problem gambling and money-laundering.",

The next survey won\u2019t be released until next year.</p> <p>Gambling addiction campaigners said an increase in TV adverts risked luring in children who are yet to show up in figures documenting problem gambling.</p> <p>\u201cAdvertising normalises gambling and encourages young persons to engage in the activity,\u201d said Derek Webb of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, which lobbies for curbs on FOBTs (fixed odds betting terminal), a type of electronic gaming machine.</p> <p>\u201cFootball advertising is getting 18-year-olds and even younger teenagers into betting shops. They are then converted by shop staff into addictive FOBT gambling through free credits, tournaments and how-to-play sessions.\u201d</p> <p>Gambling minister Tracey Crouch proposed measures to curb spending on FOBTs, which allow people to stake \u00a3100 every 20 seconds.</p> <p>But the plan was overruled by former chancellor George Osborne, whose family has made \u00a348m from the gambling industry according to the Times, which first reported the prospect of a ban on daytime gambling ads.</p> <p>The government\u2019s triennial review of gambling will also look at the use of social media to promote gambling and the impact that has on children, the newspaper reported.</p> <p>Industry sources cast doubt on the prospect of a ban, saying the Department for Culture Media and Sport was mystified by reports the government was considering such a move.</p> <p>A DCMS spokesperson said: \u201cWe will continue to monitor the effectiveness of existing gambling controls and will take further action if necessary.\u201d</p> <p>But stock market traders sold shares in companies they thought would be affected if the proposals become reality.</p> <p>Shares in William Hill were down nearly 4% while ITV lost 4.6% and Ladbrokes lost 5% of its stock market value.</p> <p>Scrutiny of gambling adverts has intensified amid a succession of payouts by firms found to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/29/paddy-power-encouraged-gambler-lost-home-jobs-family-gambling-commission-report\">failed to prevent problem gambling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/27/gala-coral-fined-over-gambler-who-stole-850000-to-feed-habit\">money-laundering</a>.</p>",

    "webTitle": "EU imposes import duties of up to 73.7% on cheap Chinese steel", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Union has slapped tariffs of up to 73.7% on Chinese steel after manufacturers were forced to cut jobs due falling prices and demand for the material amid an influx of cheap imports from Asia. Thousand of job have already been lost in the steel industry in Britain in the last year with thousands more at risk as the sector remains under pressure. Industry leaders have partly blamed the squeeze on the sector on China\u2019s dumping of cheap steel in Europe as it struggles to find buyers for its products domestically. The EU has agreed to impose import duties of between 13.2% and 22.6% on Chinese hot-rolled steel, which is used in pipelines and gas containers, and 65.1% and 73.7% on heavy plates, which are used in civil engineering projects. The state of the steel industry became part of the debate about Britain\u2019s future in the EU before the referendum in June, with Brexiters claiming that the country would be better able to protect workers and introduce tariffs on Chinese imports if it voted to leave. UK Steel, the industry trade body, welcomed the speed at which the new EU tariffs had been introduced but warned that the levy on hot-rolled steel was not high enough, which could hurt Port Talbot, the biggest steelworks in Britain. Dominic King, head of policy and external affairs at UK Steel, said: \u201cThe speed at which tariffs have been imposed on dumped steel from China by the EU is very welcome. However, while we hope the tariffs for heavy plate are robust enough to ensure free and fair trade, the proposed levels for hot-rolled steel are not high enough, which might encourage China to continue dumping it on to the EU market.\u201d David Martin, Labour MEP for Scotland, said the tariffs may be \u201ctoo little too late\u201d for the UK industry. Martin, the international trade spokesman for the Socialist and Democrats group in the European parliament, said: \u201cThe [European] commission has recognised that Chinese dumping is having a real, damaging effect on EU steel producers and the communities supported by them. \u201cHowever, whilst the tariffs on heavy-plate steel are at a workable level, the duties on hot-rolled steel \u2013 a crucial product of Tata Steel\u2019s Port Talbot plant \u2013 won\u2019t deter Chinese steelmakers from further dumping. I sincerely hope these duties will be revised upwards at a later date. \u201cWhat is pleasing is that this procedure was concluded five weeks ahead of schedule \u2013 finally the commission is waking up to the urgency of this situation. Whether it is too little, too late for UK steel, only time will tell.\u201d The future of Port Talbot and Tata Steel\u2019s 11,000 UK staff remains unclear as the Indian company considers a merger with German group ThyssenKrupp and tries to negotiate a rescue package with the UK government. Trade union leaders hit out at Tata Steel on Friday over its failure to sell off its speciality steels business in Yorkshire and County Durham. Tata Steel put the business up for sale in the summer as it desperately tried to stem the losses in its UK business. The speciality steels arm employs more than 2,000 people in Sheffield, Rotherham and Hartlepool. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of steelworkers union Community, said the business was of \u201chuge importance\u201d to the area. He added: \u201cWhen Tata announced that they wanted to sell the business, we called on them to act as a responsible seller. The continued lack of information about that process and the worry this has caused amongst their loyal workforce is highly irresponsible. \u201cSpeciality steels has every chance of a bright, profitable future, but this will only be possible if Tata ensure a new owner is able to invest in the business and build a positive relationship with the workforce. \u201cThe months of uncertainty and delays must end today. Tata must come clean about the state of the sales process and fully involve the trade unions in helping to build a new future for this vital industry and its highly skilled workers.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond has ruled out a \u201csplurge\u201d in public spending to support the economy in next month\u2019s autumn statement and said that any help to boost demand would be on only small projects that deliver productivity improvements. Speaking in Washington, the chancellor said he would wait for more data on the state of the post-Brexit economy before making any decisions but made it clear that the previously announced \u201cre-set\u201d to fiscal policy would be on a modest scale. Hammond said it was sensible to abandon the plan announced by his predecessor, George Osborne, to run a budget surplus by the end of the current parliament in 2019-20 and that there was now an opportunity to support the economy. \u201cNow is a good time to invest in genuinely productivity-enhancing infrastructure, and to take advantage of low borrowing costs and our ability to borrow. \u201cBut this is not about a fiscal splurge. It is about supporting the economy in a measured and balanced way.\u201d The chancellor left open the option of doing nothing in the autumn statement, saying that he would make up his mind as more data came in over the next month. But he dropped the broadest of hints that he is planning to supplement the stimulus provided by the Bank of England with \u201ccareful, considered and targeted\u201d measures. At the end of a week that has seen sterling fall to a fresh 31-year-low on a daily basis, Hammond was careful to do nothing to add to the downward pressure on the pound. He dampened speculation that the government would announce some high-profile public spending initiatives in the autumn statement, pointing instead to smaller-scale projects \u2013 such as road and rail improvements \u2013 with sizeable pay offs. Hammond said it was not sensible to stick to Osborne\u2019s plan given the expectation that there would be turbulence for the two-year period of negotiations between Britain and the other 27 EU states that will begin by next March. But he said the state of Britain\u2019s public finances meant there was still the need for a timetable to get borrowing down. \u201cWe have very high debt to GDP and a significant budget deficit. It is not credible to leave fiscal policy unanchored. I want to give the markets a clear set of benchmarks and will set out my plan in the autumn statement.\u201d The chancellor said it was quite often the \u201cmodest\u201d public infrastructure projects that had the best returns, because they could to be started quickly. \u201cThey give a short-term boost to the economy but also provide longer-term benefits.\u201d He added: \u201cIt will not be spending in the way previous chancellors have used the word investment. It will be investment in the way a businessman would understand the word investment.\u201d Hammond said he wanted a framework that allowed him to respond to economic conditions, stressing that if the official figures for growth in the third quarter \u2013 due out in late October \u2013 was much stronger than expected he might do nothing. Financial markets, however, are braced for some action from the Treasury in the autumn statement given the comments made by both the chancellor and the prime minister, Theresa May, since the Brexit vote on 23 June. Hammond said the UK was fundamentally strong. \u201cThe data for the first half of 2016 has been revised up to show that the economy going into the referendum was stronger than we thought. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t alter the fact that I expect there to be a period of turbulence as the economy responds to the uncertainty that the vote has created, and adjusts to the changed arrangement with the European Union. \u201cAlthough the economy has been resilient, we have to expect and plan for ups and downs that will be seen over the next 24 months as we negotiate our exit from the EU.\u201d Hammond said he was not surprised at the tough noises emerging from other EU countries, saying that was simply part of the negotiating process. \u201cWe will say what we want and say it is non-negotiable. They will say what they want and insist it is non-negotiable. Then we will negotiate,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The American Egg Board, the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s egg-marketing arm, acted wrongly in its attempt to crush a plant-based mayonnaise startup, the USDA said in a report. The Guardian revealed last year that the American Egg Board (AEB) lobbied for a concerted attack on Hampton Creek, a food company that has created a low-cost plant-based egg replacement and the maker of Just Mayo, a mayonnaise alternative. According to documents acquired by Freedom of Information Act experts Jeffrey Light and Ryan Shapiro and passed to the Guardian, the AEB advised agriculture giant Unilever how best to pursue action against Hampton Creek, joked about having Hampton Creek founder Josh Tetrick killed, and paid PR firm Edelman to buy coverage praising industrial farming on food blogs in response. The board also discussed ways to have Hampton Creek\u2019s products pulled from the Whole Foods supermarket chain. While the AEB is overseen by the USDA and funded by a federal levy on eggs, it is composed of current and former egg-industry executives. At the recommendation of the USDA, AEB members \u201cwill be required to complete additional training regarding proper email etiquette and ethics\u201d related to the joking threats, will have to complete yet more ethics training related to the plan to end Just Mayo\u2019s distribution at Whole Foods, and will have to be trained further still regarding the pop-up ads it had bought against Tetrick\u2019s name to advertise egg product. The AEB will no longer work with Edelman. The USDA found the AEB acted correctly when it advised Unilever on the most efficient way to carry out action against Hampton Creek. Additionally, the inquiry discovered that Joanne Ivy had ordered staff to purge emails that referred to Hampton Creek or its old brand name, Beyond Eggs. Staff did not obey the instructions, and the emails were retrieved, though Ivy herself deleted the Beyond Eggs emails. More training will be required to ensure staff carry out record retention policies. Ivy, honored as 2015\u2019s Egg Person of the Year at the Urner Barry marketing conference, resigned a year ago this month. Hampton Creek, based in San Francisco, gained media attention because of its feel-good message of wanting to improve the food system with healthier, more environmentally friendly products. But more recently, Bloomberg reported that the startup used contractors to buy its products from supermarket shelves, thus inflating the sales figures given to investors. Hampton Creek did not immediately respond when asked by the Associated Press about the Bloomberg stories. The Associated Press contributed to this report",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has issued a further profit warning after the overnight \u201cflash crash\u201d in the value of sterling caused the company to lose \u00a315m in the currency markets. In a statement to the stock exchange on Friday, the company said a bet designed to protect itself against a slump in sterling had gone wrong and would reduce full-year profits. The group\u2019s shares slumped by 9.1%. In the past year Sports Direct has been hit by a scandal over its treatment of workers and a series of earnings downgrades, which have been blamed on tough trading conditions. Immediately after the EU referendum result in June, the company said the fall in the pound against the dollar was \u201clikely to impact purchases for which the company is currently not hedged for the [full financial year] and beyond\u201d. However, a subsequent move to hedge the group against a fall in the value of sterling, seems to have gone wrong. Sports Direct said on Friday: \u201cExtreme movements [in the currency markets] overnight resulted in a crystallisation of [the hedge] rate at 1.19, resulting in a negative impact of approximately \u00a315m on the company\u2019s [full-year] underlying [earnings] expectation.\u201d It added: \u201cIf the GBP/USD rate is 1.20 on average for the remainder of [the financial year], then the negative impact on the company\u2019s underlying expectation would be in the order of a further \u00a320m.\u201d The company is adversely affected by a drop in the value of the pound against the dollar, as it needs to acquire US currency in order to buy stock in Asia. The latest embarrassment will pile further pressure on the company to hire a permanent finance director. Matt Pearson has been the acting chief financial officer since the summer of 2015. Sports Direct has been without a permanent finance director since Bob Mellors stood down on health grounds in late 2013. Pearson could not be contacted and company spokespeople did not return calls. Sports Direct shares closed down 9% at 273p. Analysts at the investment bank Liberum slashed its price target on the shares to 310p from 380p and they said that the impact could continue for two years. \u201c[We] have modelled this impact [of falling sterling] for 2018 and 2019 as well,\u201d Liberum said. It predicted that earnings per share might fall by 20%-23% over the next three years.",

      "bodyText": "Economists are in the dog house after a succession of bad calls, from the failure to spot the 2008 banking crash to the impact of the Brexit vote, which many said would be terrible and has so far only dented growth. That means any cheering for the winner of the Nobel prize in economics when it is announced on Monday might be muted. What economist can expect a hero\u2019s welcome when the standing of the profession with the general public is probably at an all-time low? Will the prize awarding committee decide that the equilibrium models it has rewarded for so many years are broken and choose from outside the mainstream? From the look of the runners and riders nominated by Thomson Reuters, who are singled out for the number of citations in journals and reports and articles they have produced, the mainstream still rules. They are all from major US universities and appear to accept the basic tenets of the profession. Worse, according to Kingston University\u2019s Steve Keen, they tinker with the existing models of economic activity rather than accept the models are wrong. The Sveriges Riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel may not be among the official prizes, being devised at a later date than the prizes for chemistry and medicine, but it is still an important guide to how the profession thinks about the world, and how connected it is to the real economy. Olivier Blanchard Blanchard came to prominence as chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. Appointed by former French finance minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn to bring a less conservative influence to bear, he was left high and dry when Strauss-Kahn was forced to quit following a sex scandal, and the right of centre Christine Lagarde took over. He stepped down last year to become the C. Fred Bergsten senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute. He is also an economics professor at MIT. George Osborne took him to task while chancellor after Blanchard said the UK\u2019s severe austerity measures were \u201cplaying with fire\u201d. The Frenchman apologised, and has since made strides in explaining why mainstream macroeconomic models can be so wide of the mark. More specifically he has studied economic fluctuations and how they affect employment. Edward Lazear Lazear was not educated at the notoriously free market Chicago University economics department, but he has taught there. He has since returned to California and is the Morris Arnold and Nona Jean Cox senior fellow at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution, where he is a professor of human resources, management and economics. His research centres on employee incentives and how they can improve productivity. He has taken these studies and almost turned them into a management guide, using economic models to show how employees can be made to work more efficiently. Marc Melitz A professor of political economy in Harvard\u2019s department of economics, Melitz\u2019s citations reached a peak in 2014, and that might mean he is out of the running. But giving him the award would show the Nobel committee\u2019s despair at the anti-globalisation sentiment seen in Europe and the US. His work is known for showing how free trade weeds out weaker businesses and allows those that win international deals to flourish. Last year\u2019s winner was the Scottish economist Angus Deaton, who won for his work studying poverty, so there could be a swing to the right this year for the sake of balance. Paul Romer The World Bank\u2019s new chief economist is endlessly cited as a possible winner after making his reputation in the 1980s with his study of economic growth and technological change. In recent years Romer has come to criticise the mainstream economic establishment, arguing against the fashion for mathematical equations in econometrics, which dominates university teaching, preferring economics that takes human behaviour into account. New York University\u2019s Stern Business School, where he teaches, caused a storm on Thursday when it inadvertently published a press release naming him as the 2016 winner and inviting journalists to a press conference. A very embarrassed official quickly took down the release and the Nobel committee said a decision had yet to be made.",

      "bodyText": "The day began with news of a flash crash in the value of the pound against the dollar in Asian trading. The pound plunged from about $1.26 to $1.18 in the space of two minutes. And no one knows why. Before we close up for the day, here is a summary of the main developments: The sudden and shock 6% drop in the pound in Asia trading puzzled and shocked investors. Fat fingers, algorithms, and tough Brexit comments from President Hollande were all offered as possible explanations Sterling regained some of the lost ground, and is currently down 1.6% at $1.2416 The FTSE 100 was the only major European index to rise, and is currently up 0.7% or 46 points to 7,046 HSBC issued a very gloomy note on the pound, predicting it will fall to $1.10 and reach parity against the euro by the end of 2017 The Bank of England says it is \u201clooking at\u201d the causes of the flash crash UK industrial output fell unexpectedly in August, and is likely to be a drag on third quarter growth according to economists Speaking in Washington DC, Philip Hammond said the government will sell-off its remaining 9.1% stake in Lloyds Banking Group, selling directly into the market. It means Hammond is abandoning George Osborne\u2019s plan to offer cut price shares to the public And sticking in the US, the September non-farm payrolls report was weaker than expected, but economists said it does not rule out the possibility of a rate hike in December Thank you for reading the blog and for all your comments. The latest developments throughout the rest of the day will be here. Have a great weekend. AM US markets are slightly down in early trading: Dow Jones: -0.3% at 18,214 S&amp;P 500: -0.04% at 2,160 Nasdaq: -0.07% at 4,871 While the non-farms were being published in the US, the UK government announced it is going to sell its remaining 9.1% stake in Lloyds Banking Group directly into the stock market. This means it is abandoning George Osborne\u2019s plan to offer the public cut price shares. From Washington, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: Returning Lloyds to the private sector is in the interests of the bank, taxpayers and the country as a whole. That is why exiting our stake in Lloyds in an orderly way and at the best possible price is one of my top priorities as chancellor. I have listened to the experts. Ongoing market volatility means it is not the right time for a retail offer. Our plan will get back all the cash taxpayers invested in Lloyds during the financial crisis and leave the bank in a better place to continue the crucial role it plays in supporting individuals, families and businesses up and down the UK. It seems that Hammond\u2019s aim is to get rid of the government\u2019s stake in the bank over the next 12 months. It looks like shares will be sold below the 73.6p average price at which taxpayers bought a 43% stake in the bank for \u00a320.3bn at the time of the 2008 crisis. The shares are trading around 53p. The Treasury says that overall it will not make a loss because it has already raised about \u00a316.9bn from previous sell-offs of Lloyds shares. The US non-farm payrolls in charts... There were 156,000 jobs added in September, lower than the monthly average of 178,000 so far this year: The US unemployment rate picked up to 5% in September from 4.9% in August: Here is the full story on non-farm payrolls from the Guardian\u2019s Jana Kasperkevic in New York: Rob Carnell, ING\u2019s chief international economist, appears underwhelmed by the US non-farm payrolls report for August, which he describes as \u201cneither here nor there\u201d. He says that the report does not rule out a US rate rise in December. Reasonable, but not great payrolls, an uptick in the unemployment rate, and softish wages growth \u2013 but still good enough to keep thoughts of a December rate hike alive \u2013 pending the market reaction to the presidential election, and further adequate labour reports. Markets will see nothing in this report to encourage thoughts of a November Fed rate hike \u2013 most forecasters still expect the Fed to hike in December, and this release is good enough, without being particularly good, to keep such expectations firm. Carnell flags up the key dates in the run-up to the Fed\u2019s December rate decision: The weaker-than-expected 156,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in September was weaker than the average monthly jobs growth of 178,000 so far this year. The biggest single driver behind new jobs last month was the professional and business services sector, up 67,000. There were also rises in healthcare jobs, retail, and the food and drink sectors. But employment in other major industries, including manufacturing, construction, logistics and government were little changed. The September jobs report from the US Labor Department also revealed a surprise rise in the unemployment rate to 5% from 4.9% in August. Average earnings were in line with expectations, rising by 0.2% month-on-month, following a 0.1% increase in August. The weaker-than-expected jobs report will lower expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise rates before the end of the year. There were 156,000 jobs added in September, lower than the 175,000 forecast by economists. That\u2019s a significant miss. Slightly better news was that the figure for August was revised up to 167,000 from 151,000. More soon. It\u2019s almost time for US non-farm payrolls for September. Here are consensus expectations: Non-farms: 175,000 (151,000 in August) Unemployment rate: 4.9% (4.9% in August) Average earnings growth m/m: 0.2% (0.1% in August) Worth mentioning this morning\u2019s UK trade data for August, which was worse than expected. Britain\u2019s trade in goods deficit widened to \u00a312.1bn in August, from a downwardly revised \u00a39.5bn in July according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists had forecast an \u00a311.3bn deficit. The deficit widened so much because growth in imports was far sharper than growth in exports. Imports rose by \u00a32.7bn to \u00a337.9bn, while exports increased by just \u00a3100m to \u00a325.8bn. On a day when the pound is under the spotlight, the trade figures seem to suggest that as yet, the fall in sterling since the 23 June Brexit vote has yet to boost exports as hoped. We haven\u2019t heard anything yet from the chancellor Philip Hammond on the pound\u2019s flash crash overnight. He is in Washington DC (where it is almost 7.30am) for the IMF meetings. We\u2019ll see if has any comment as business gets underway in the US. The latest scores: Pound is down 2% against the dollar at $1.2358 Sterling is off 2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1098 FTSE 100 is up 49 points or 0.7% at 7,049 FTSE 250 is down 0.6% at 18,007 Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says investors only now seem to the reality of Brexit: If the pound was a prize fighter the referee would have already rung the bell, the currency bloodied and bruised beyond belief. It seems that sterling is recreating last night\u2019s flash crash in slow motion, its losses against the dollar widening to 2.6%, taking it under $1.23 in the process; against the euro things were just as bad, the pound plunging under \u20ac1.13 following a 2.4% fall. Beyond the post-flash crash fear that seems to have taken hold of investors, the intensification of sterling\u2019s decline can largely be pinned on two factors this morning. Firstly, both the manufacturing and industrial production readings came in below expectations at 0.2% and -0.4% respectively, somewhat contradicting the positive PMIs from earlier in the week. Secondly, and perhaps most damningly, HSBC issued a pretty bleak statement claiming that, as the \u2018defacto official opposition to the government\u2019s [Brexit] policies\u2019, the pound could well find itself circling $1.10 by the end of next year. As has been the trend this week the pound\u2019s plight has proven to be catnip for the FTSE, with the UK index climbing 58 points to tickle 7070. The Eurozone indices, on the other hand, are less than enthused about the euro\u2019s recent strength, with the DAX and CAC both falling 0.8% apiece. Sterling: how low did it go? (And why does it matter?). This FT piece from Katie Martin and Jennifer Hughes is well worth a read. It talks about the technical difficulty of finding one correct figure for the pound\u2019s low in last night\u2019s flash crash. They explain: The problem with finding the actual low is that currencies are traded on dozens of different platforms, and the levels each shows reflect the trades that are conducted on that system. In normal market conditions, this makes little if any difference. The move overnight was\u2026 not normal. EBS, the trading platform owned and operated by ICAP and one of the central points of reference, particularly for sterling, says it is taking $1.1938 as the low \u2013 a level that was traded \u201cin low amount\u201d. Bloomberg\u2019s reported low is $1.1841. Thomson Reuters, however, is our outlier. Earlier, the system reported a trade at $1.1378 \u2013 wildly below the other big platforms. That has since been scrubbed from the system. It is however standing by an absolute low of $1.1491 in a trade at 23.07 GMT \u2013 or 7.07am Hong Kong time, which is when the plunge began. That is not all. Reuters is also publishing a \u201cmarket low\u201d where a \u201cgood amount\u201d \u2013 ie, \u00a35m or more, was traded within a 3 minute window. This low was $1.15 and happened \u201caround the same time as the absolute low.\u201d Good luck to the traders trying to work this one out. The message is coming in loud and clear from the EU now: we will be tough with the UK on Brexit. The latest comments come from Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission. Speaking in Paris on Friday, he said: It should be obvious that if the United Kingdom wants to have free access to the [EU\u2019s] internal market all the rules and all the liberties...need to be fully respected. You can\u2019t have one foot in and one foot out. On this point we need to be intransigent. I see the manoeuvring. Expectations are mounting that the UK is in store for a so-called \u201chard Brexit\u201d, with the UK government prioritising greater control on immigration over full access to the single market. Here is our full story on those tough Brexit comments from the French President, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: Simon French from Panmure Gordon draws a parallels with other periods of economic crisis in the UK: After regaining some ground following the overnight 6% drop in the pound, it is now down 2% against the dollar at $1.2335. But investors are putting their money into Britain\u2019s biggest, global companies, listed on the FTSE 100. The index of major shares is up 76 points or 1% at 7,075. Jasper Lawler, market analysts at CMC markets, said markets are a little \u201cdazed and confused\u201d today. Traders have been left reeling from a historic flash crash in the pound. A weaker pound continues to be a positive for UK equities, which were flirting with record highs. But the size of the drop in currency markets was not mirrored in the rise in the FTSE 100. The benefits of a weaker pound for exports and higher inflation are being offset by a concern the exchange rate\u2019s decline has become destabilising. Equity indices in the Eurozone, which don\u2019t reap the currency benefits of a devalued British pound were showing caution, down slightly, ahead of this afternoon\u2019s US jobs data. The FTSE\u2019s top risers at the moment: There have been disappointing figures from Britain\u2019s industrial sector this morning. Industrial output fell unexpectedly in August by 0.4%, following a 0.1% rise in July according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists polled by Reuters were forecasting a 0.1% increase. Manufacturing output - classed as a sub sector of the broader industrial measure - also disappointed, rising by 0.2% in August against expectations of a 0.5% increase. It was better than July however, when output fell by 0.9%. Mining and quarrying was the biggest drag on industry in August, falling by 3.7%, largely because of maintenance in several North Sea oil fields . It slowed the annual growth rate of industrial production to 0.7% in August from 2.1% in July. Economists said the sector was likely to be a drag on economic growth in the third quarter overall. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, believes industrial production is set for a 0.2% fall quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. He adds: Thankfully, however, strong increases in services output in June and July suggest that GDP growth won\u2019t slow too sharply in Q3; we still expect 0.5% growth. The Bank of England has confirmed that it will investigate why the pound plunged inexplicably overnight. A simple statement from the Bank, but a significant one: We are looking at the causes of the sharp falls over night. Although the pound has regained some ground following the 6% fall, it is still down 1.6% at $1.2409 against the dollar. It has left the pound on course for its worst week since the Brexit vote in June. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, says the slump in the pound has \u201call the hall marks of a computer system going a bit haywire\u201d. He also says it seems possible that some orders placed overnight might become the subject of dispute. A very gloomy prediction from HSBC. The bank\u2019s currency experts say the pound has some way to go before it reaches a bottom. Specifically, they say the pound will fall to $1.10 against the dollar and hit parity against the euro by the end of 2017, as fears of a hard Brexit intensify. David Bloom, HSBC\u2019s global head of FX, says the pound has become a political currency. Brexit, whether one likes it or not, is a political decision, one we have to respect. The currency is now the de facto official opposition to the government\u2019s policies. The argument which is still presented to us, that the UK and EU will resolve their difference and come to an amicable deal, appears a little surreal. It is becoming clear that many European countries will come to the negotiation table looking for political damage limitation rather than economic damage limitation. A lose-lose situation is the inevitable outcome. The pound used to be a relatively simple currency that used to trade on cyclical events and data, but now it has become a political and structural currency. This is a recipe for weakness given its twin deficits. Tin hats on folks! And again, off that cliff: The FT has taken an interesting look at how the pound fell from $1.26 against the dollar to a little over $1.18 in two minutes. Below is an extract, but you can read the full piece here. In the Hong Kong/Singapore timezone, 7.07am to 7.09am. In the 60 seconds from 7.07am, the pound moved from $1.26 through $1.25 to a low of $1.203. Between $1.26 and $1.25, traders say the move was orderly. But when it tumbled through $1.24 \u201cthat was when all hell broke loose,\u201d according to one banker. The low was $1.1819 at 7.09am, based on Reuters data. It took a further 30 minutes for the pound to regain $1.24, during which time activity was fairly steady as traders regained composure after that unnerving tumble. The pound is on course for a 4% drop against the dollar, currently trading at $1.24. The pound is also down 1.1% against the euro, at \u20ac1.1181. So how is the dramatic overnight crash in the pound going down in the City? Here is a inside take on what might be happening on London\u2019s trading floors: As well as being \u2018flash crash\u2019 day, today is also non-farm payrolls day in the US. The latest official monthly snapshot of the US jobs market will be published at 1.30pm UK time. It is expected to show a 175,000 increase in jobs in September, following a disappointing 151,ooo rise in August. Average earnings are expected to pick up 0.2% over the month, following a 0.1% rise in August. As ever, the report will be closely scrutinised by investors and economists for signs of whether it makes a US rate hike more or less likely before the end of 2016. Any number above 200,000 is likely to trigger a spike in expectations that the Fed will raise rates in December. The FTSE 100 is up 28 points or 0.4% in early trading. The FTSE 250 - which features more UK focused companies - is also climbing this morning, up 0.2% at 18,160. All other major European indices are in the red: FTSE 100: +0.4% at 7,028 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.4% at 10,523 France\u2019s CAC: -0.5% at 4,459 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 16,489 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.5% at 8,717 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.5% at 341 Back to the theory that the massive sell-off of the pound was down to algorithms... Analysts say that the move could have been triggered by automated trading systems reacting to the news report on Hollande. The idea is that computers are set to sell the pound if they detect negative news stories on Brexit. Of course, the good old fat finger theory has not been discounted, which refers to human error, when a trader enters a number by mistake. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, says the pound had a \u201crollercoaster ride\u201d overnight. She says the politics are proving a dangerous game for the pound: The big issue for the pound right now is that it has become detached from the economic fundamentals and politics have become king. This is where things will get dangerous for the currency going forward. Theresa May\u2019s hard-line on Brexit negotiations and her insistence that negotiations will take place in private have only increased uncertainty for the market, with traders left combing news websites for the latest headlines to try and gauge for themselves the state of play between the UK and the EU. Brooks also explains that we might never know what triggered last night dramatic crash (and we might see another one): This highlights the drawback of machines making trading decisions, however, it is the reality, and it is only getting more popular. Thus, another flash crash is possible. Unlike the flash crash that impacted the Dow Jones in 2013 and which triggered an investigation by the US authorities, the FX market is not regulated in the same way, so there is unlikely to be an investigation and we may never know what actually happened last night. But, if there is another flash crash, the pound is vulnerable because such unstable forces are driving it. The FTSE 100 is expected to open higher this morning following the crash in the pound overnight. The finger is being pointed at French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande this morning. According to some, Hollande\u2019s tough comments about Brexit negotiations are behind the shock fall in the pound overnight. Speaking in Paris at a dinner attended by some of the most senior EU officials, including the Commission\u2019s President Jean-Claude Juncker, Hollande said: The UK has decided to do a Brexit, I believe even a hard Brexit. Well, then we must go all the way through the UK\u2019s willingness to leave the EU. We have to have this firmness. If not, we would jeopardise the fundamental principles of the EU. Other countries would want to leave the EU to get the supposed advantages without the obligations. There must be a threat, there must be a risk, there must be a price. Otherwise we will be in a negotiation that cannot end well. Referring to the time when Jacques Delors, Hollande\u2019s mentor, had to deal with \u201ca crisis triggered by the UK too\u201d, the French President said: Then Ms Thatcher wanted to stay in Europe, but she wanted a cheque in return. Now, the UK wants to leave and pay nothing. It\u2019s not possible. This is what happened to the pound vs the dollar overnight in Asia: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The dramatic fall in the pound overnight has shaken the City this morning. The UK woke up to the news that sterling crashed more than 6% in two minutes in Asian trading, taking it to a new 31 year low of $1.1841. Sterling has since regained some ground, and is now down 1.3% at $1.2453. Algorithms, fat fingers, and mounting fears over a Hard Brexit have all been offered as possible explanations behind the major move, but nobody really knows why. It\u2019s worth pointing out that trading volumes were thin at the time, heightening the impact of any move. This will be considered a warning shot by some. A taste of things to come perhaps as Britain faces up to the serious challenges posed by the process of exiting the EU. We will be bringing you the latest throughout the day.",

Secondly, and perhaps most damningly, HSBC issued a pretty bleak statement claiming that, as the \u2018defacto official opposition to the government\u2019s [Brexit] policies\u2019, the pound could well find itself circling $1.10 by the end of next year.</p> \n   <p> As has been the trend this week the pound\u2019s plight has proven to be catnip for the FTSE, with the UK index climbing 58 points to tickle 7070.

They explain:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> The problem with finding the actual low is that currencies are traded on dozens of different platforms, and the levels each shows reflect the trades that are conducted on that system. In normal market conditions, this makes little if any difference.

Earlier, the system reported a trade at $1.1378 \u2013 wildly below the other big platforms. That has since been scrubbed from the system.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond has abandoned his predecessor\u2019s plan to offer the public cut-price shares in Lloyds Banking Group by announcing he will sell off the government\u2019s remaining 9% stake in the bailed-out bank on the stock market. When George Osborne was chancellor he blamed \u201cmarket turbulence\u201d for postponing the retail offering of Lloyds shares, which had been promised in the Conservative party\u2019s 2015 election manifesto as the \u201cbiggest privatisation for 20 years\u201d. Hammond will now sell shares directly into the market with the aim of getting rid of the government\u2019s stake in its entirety in the next 12 months. The move means that the shares will be sold below the 73.6p average price at which taxpayers bought a 43% stake in the bank for \u00a320.3bn at the time of the 2008 crisis. The shares are trading around 53p. \u201cI have listened to the experts. Ongoing market volatility means it is not the right time for a retail offer,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cReturning Lloyds to the private sector is in the interests of the bank, taxpayers and the country as a whole. That is why exiting our stake in Lloyds in an orderly way and at the best possible price is one of my top priorities as chancellor,\u201d he said. The Treasury said it would not make a loss because it had already raised about \u00a316.9bn from previous sell-offs of Lloyds shares. \u201cOur plan will get back all the cash taxpayers invested in Lloyds during the financial crisis and leave the bank in a better place to continue the crucial role it plays in supporting individuals, families and businesses up and down the UK,\u201d Hammond said. Hammond said the time had not come to sell off any more of Royal Bank of Scotland, in which the taxpayer still owns 73% after just one sell-off \u2013 a 5% stake in August 2015 at a \u00a31bn loss. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the disposal of RBS shares at a price that recovers taxpayer\u2019s investment is not practical at the moment,\u201d Hammond said. He said that the sell off RBS could not take place until the bank had sorted out of the spin off 300 branches as mandated by the EU as penalty for state aid. Neither could the shares be sold until RBS had reached a settlement a long-running investigation by the US Department of Justice into the mis-selling of mortgage bonds. This is similar to the case currently hammering confidence in Deutsche Bank. Osborne had said he would sell shares to the public at a 5% discount on the prevailing market price \u2013 a pledge made in October 2015 when the shares were trading at nearly 78p. The Treasury said investment bankers at Morgan Stanley would instigate a \u201ctrading plan \u2026 to effect a measured and orderly sell down of shares\u201d which would begin on Friday and end no later than 6 October 2017. Financial firms had hoped to be involved in the sell-off and 350,000 potential investors had registered with Hargreaves Lansdown Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThis would have been an opportunity to not only raise money for the Treasury but also to democratise retail investing. \u201cShare offers of this nature are an excellent mechanism for developing consumer interest in long-term investments, so this decision to place shares via an institution hardly seems in keeping with the new government\u2019s mantra of standing up for ordinary people.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Giant kites could supply green energy without the need for taxpayer-funded subsidies within years, according to one of the firms developing the technology. Kite Power Solutions expects to open the UK\u2019s first kite power plant in March 2017 at the Ministry of Defence\u2019s West Freugh site in Stranraer, Scotland. It hopes to roll out the technology onshore and at sea, building systems with the capacity to produce \u201chundreds of megawatts\u201d of power within the decade. The company believes the technology, developed by a handful of firms around the world, could slash the cost of wind energy supplied by conventional turbines. And it predicted that kite power would cost so little that developing countries would be able to use it to wean themselves off polluting diesel generators and other carbon-heavy energy sources. The technology involves rigging two giant kites, each up to 70 square metres, to either side of a turbine. The first kite rises with the wind, up to a height of 450 metres, moving in a figure-of-eight pattern. The movement pulls a rope that turns a turbine, generating power. As one kite descends, the other rises in tandem, meaning that electricity can be generated almost constantly. A spokesman for Kite Power Solutions said the technology could halve the cost of offshore wind energy, dispensing with the need for governments to subsidise wind in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. David Ainsworth said offshore wind energy was predicted to cost about 10 euro cents (9p) per kWh by 2022, meaning governments would be forced to pay the difference between that and the wholesale cost of energy, currently about 5.5 cents per kWh. BVG Associates energy consultancy estimates that kite power could cost just five cents per kWh. Ainsworth said the technology was easy to install and maintain, meaning it could be deployed in deep water, on floating structures far from shore. \u201cIf we do that, it opens up a global deepwater offshore wind market,\u201d he said. The technology could curb rising CO2 emissions in the developing world, where the need to save money forces people to resort to polluting technologies such as diesel, Ainsworth said. The company has tested the technology on a small scale in Essex and will move its headquarters to Glasgow in readiness for next year\u2019s launch. It has won planning permission for a 500kW demonstration system but plans to build a 3MW power station after that and is identifying other sites to develop. A 3MW system would be comparable in power to smaller wind turbines but can produce up to 20% more energy, the company claims. It will also be less than 20% of the weight of a conventional horizontal axis wind turbine, which is made partly out of steel. The kite can fly higher than the tip of a wind turbine, reaching heights where wind tends to be stronger and more consistent. The UK\u2019s green energy trade body, RenewableUK, welcomed the technology but warned it was not a silver bullet. The deputy chief executive, Maf Smith, said: \u201cThis is an ambitious project to harness wind power at extraordinary heights and it shows the level of innovation within the renewables industry. \u201cKite power is at an early stage of development and it will be interesting to see how the technology progresses. We will need a wide range of energy sources in the future to meet our needs in a sustainable way.\u201d Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates has said there is a 10% chance kite power could be the \u201cmagic solution\u201d for global renewable energy needs. Kite Power Solutions has received funding from the former Department of Energy and Climate Change, the Energy Entrepreneurs Fund and private backers. Its largest shareholders are Kite Power Solution\u2019s chief executive, Bill Hampton, and chief operating officer, John Hardy.",

      "bodyText": "The pound is worth less than \u20ac1 at airport bureaux de change, hitting holidaymakers hard, sending the cost of a skiing break into the stratosphere and shrinking pension incomes for expats in Spain, but making Britain a bargain basement destination for tourists. Bureaux de change At Southend airport on Friday morning, Moneycorp was offering holidaymakers \u20ac0.97 for each \u00a31, while at Heathrow and Birmingham airport, the best on offer was just a smidgen over parity with the euro, at \u20ac1.004. In November 2015, the peak market rate for sterling was \u20ac1.425 to the pound; although holidaymakers would not have enjoyed such a rate, spending abroad is now costing Britons 15-20% more than before the Brexit vote. Pensioners abroad About one-third of the 300,000 British people living in Spain are in receipt of a UK state pension and have effectively had a large pay cut since the EU referendum. The \u00a3119.30 a week basic state pension was worth as much as \u20ac170 a week last year, but is now worth \u20ac133 a week. John Hayward, a financial adviser for British residents on the Costa Blanca, based in J\u00e1vea, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom. The pound is down a lot, but the value of their investments have gone up as the stock market has soared since Brexit. You are not hearing too much moaning down at the bowls club. It\u2019s still much better than 2009, when both sterling and the stock market were down.\u201d However, he said it was inevitable that sterling\u2019s plunge would have derailed plans for some retirees, with the cost of buying a property in Spain jumping significantly in sterling terms since the Brexit vote. Skiing holidays Even before the flash crash on Friday, the price of skiing holidays, especially to the US, had become fantastically expensive. A week\u2019s ski pass in the Rocky Mountains resort of Vail now costs British visitors \u00a3609, with ski hire another \u00a3200. Diane Palumbo of holiday operator SkiWorld said there had been a remarkable surge in canny skiers buying their lift passes and package holidays for the 2016-17 season ahead of the EU referendum. Since the decline in the pound, there has been a rise in skiers opting for all-inclusive chalet holidays where costs are controlled, Palumbo said, although there is little evidence yet that British people are abandoning traditionally popular resorts such as Val d\u2019Is\u00e8re in favour of cheaper breaks in Bulgaria. \u201cThe volumes are still there, but over the longer term, we will see people looking at prices and saying \u2018maybe we will stay away from skiing for a year\u2019. But the truth is that the ski market dropped 25% in 2008 and hasn\u2019t recovered a lot since then, and what you have now are the people who really love skiing and won\u2019t be put off by the currency,\u201d she said. Tourists to Britain Prices on Oxford Street in London and Princes Street in Edinburgh are so low that foreigners, particularly wealthy Chinese shoppers, are flocking to the UK to pick up bargains. This week is China\u2019s \u201cgolden week\u201d holiday season, and online travel site Ctrip is predicting a 40-60% increase in trips to Britain. Goods in the UK are now about 20% cheaper for Chinese buyers than a year ago and more than half of Ctrip\u2019s routes to the UK were booked up one month ahead of golden week. Britain has become the number one destination for golden week travellers to western Europe and has even elbowed aside Australia, traditionally more popular because of its proximity. Shares in luxury goods brands have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the Brexit vote, with Burberry soaring from \u00a310.40 a share just before the EU referendum on 23 June to nearly \u00a315, adding about \u00a32bn to the market value of the company.",

      "bodyText": "The US economy added only 156,000 jobs in September, the US Department of Labor announced on Friday, a figure likely to be seized on as the presidential race enters its final stretch. The unemployment rate was 5%, up from 4.9% in August. Economists had expected job growth of 175,000 and the unemployment rate to remain unchanged at 4.9%. Job growth has slowed down this year, with the number of jobs added averaging about 178,000 jobs a month. In 2015, on average about 229,000 jobs were added each month. Friday\u2019s report comes after a report released earlier this week by the payroll company ADP found that private companies added just 154,000 jobs last month. This was slowest job growth reported by ADP since April. Yet even as job growth has slowed down, the number of people applying for unemployment insurance has dropped below 250,000 for the second time this year. Last week, 249,000 people applied for unemployment benefits. The number of people currently receiving unemployment benefits is just a little over 2 million \u2013 levels last seen in 2000. The US labor market and the pace of the country\u2019s economic recovery have come into the spotlight during the presidential election. With wages finally showing some signs of growth after years of being stagnant, many people are still feeling left behind. The energy sector has been hit especially hard over the last year in the wake of low oil prices. Since reaching peak employment in September 2014, employment in the energy sector dropped by more than 220,000 to 632,000. Mining sector employment remain unchanged in September, according to the labor department. This September, US employers announced plans to cut 44,324 jobs \u2013 a 38% increase from August, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. That number, however, is 25% below the number of jobs cut this time last year. Layoffs and companies moving their operations abroad have been a key talking point for Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, throughout this election season. \u201cOur jobs are fleeing the country. They\u2019re going to Mexico, they\u2019re going to many other countries. But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and with it, firing all of their people,\u201d Trump said last week during the first presidential debate. Next month\u2019s jobs report will be released on 4 November, just four days before the US presidential election. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget, though, that ballots are already being cast across much of the country between absentee ballots and early voting,\u201d said Mark Hamrick, senior economist at Bankrate.com. \u201cIt is highly unlikely that the storyline about the economy is going to change so much that it alone would shift allegiances in the presidential slugfest.\u201d Friday\u2019s jobs report is the last one before the Federal Reserve meets on 1 and 2 November. Economists do not expect the US central bank to raise interest rates at that meeting as it is so close to the election. Recently, Trump has accused the Fed of keeping interest rates low to create a \u201cfalse economy\u201d and to benefit Barack Obama. \u201cPartisan politics plays no role in our decisions,\u201d said Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen when asked about his remarks. \u201cWe do not discuss politics at our meetings and we do not take politics into account in our decisions.\u201d The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for a first time in almost a decade last December. It was expected to raise interest rates four times this year, but forecasters now expect only one rate hike, this December. When the Federal Reserve last met in September, three of the twelve members of the Federal Market Open Committee \u2013 the policy-setting arm of the Fed \u2013 voted to raise rates. The lower than expected job numbers could lower the expectation of a December job hike. \u201cWith labor market slack being taken up at a somewhat slower pace than in previous years, scope for some further improvement in the labor market remaining, and inflation continuing to run below our 2% target, we chose to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward our objectives,\u201d Yellen said in September when explaining why the Fed chose not hike rates at that time. The Fed has also been looking for a faster growth in wages. In September, average hourly earnings went up by 6 cents to $25.79. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.6%. The Obama administration has previously referred to wages as the unfinished part of the economic recovery. Slowing job growth paired with low wages could delay an interest rate hike, according to Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. \u201cThe Fed isn\u2019t going to be rushing into action when wage growth is that tepid,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "Wells Fargo banking scandal a financial crisis we can finally understand", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For most Americans the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis was all too obvious. The economy imploded, jobs disappeared, house prices collapsed. But coming to grips with the reason it was happening \u2013 the run on mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations (AKA, CDOs), credit default swaps, synthetic derivatives, tranches \u2013 was not so easy. The mumbo jumbo mattered \u2013 and that\u2019s what made it all the more infuriating. It was a banking crisis that only the insiders could decode. Even on the occasions (both then and since) when the bank CEOs have been dragged in front of Congress for what have become almost ritual attempts to humiliate and shame them, most of those efforts have been failures. Why? Partly because of the way the bankers dodged and dived, of course. And partly because the issues involved just didn\u2019t make it easy for anyone to catch a dodging, weaving banker, advised by a canny, high-priced lawyer. It just wasn\u2019t that easy for some of the non-specialists on Senate and House committees to be as effective as they might have liked in pillorying the finance industry when the subject was the way in which traders had rigged the Libor rate (the interbank borrowing rate against which the interest rates on most loans are benchmarked), say, or the precise way in which a hedge fund participated in selecting investments in a derivative sold to a pension fund client. It\u2019s even hard to explain how some of that stuff affected ordinary Americans (even though it did \u2013 ultimately, and sometimes indirectly.) So let\u2019s be grateful that the banks have finally provided us with a scandal that we can understand, and to the regulators, for (belatedly) addressing a real problem that too many Americans grapple with daily. The Wells Fargo mess is the poster child for it all. Last month, the bank \u2013 one of the oldest in the country, with a tradition dating back to the Pony Express \u2013 disclosed that it would fork over $185m in penalties to regulators after an audit discovered that employees opened as many as 2m deposit and credit accounts in customers\u2019 names but without their consent. Testifying before Congress, John Stumpf, the bank\u2019s CEO and chairman, made much of the breach of trust on the part of more than 5,000 employees who opened the accounts, in an attempt to meeting sales quotas, either earning bonuses or simply holding on to their jobs. While initially he backed away from suggestions that he himself might have been held accountable, last week he discovered he will share some of their pain: independent directors announced they will implement salary and bonus clawbacks, and Stumpf\u2019s own compensation will be on hold while the directors investigate. But Wells isn\u2019t the only venerable Wall Street name to run afoul of regulators in recent days. Morgan Stanley, too, appears to have been putting pressure on its brokers to engage in \u201cdishonest and unethical conduct\u201d, according to the top securities regulator of Massachusetts, pushing them to cross-sell products. Cross-selling is at the heart of both the Wells Fargo and the Morgan Stanley scandals, and unlike CDOs and credit default swaps, it\u2019s something that any bank customer can understand all too easily. If you\u2019ve ever walked into a bank \u2013 or talked to a bank representative on the phone \u2013 and had him suggest that you might want to consider opening a new account or that a different product might be just perfect for your needs, when you really just called to reset your pin or check your balance, well, you\u2019ve encountered cross-selling. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it as a business strategy. In fact, it\u2019s eminently logical, and can even be good for customers, to make them aware of products or services that might be out there and fit their needs. But it only works well when it\u2019s done carefully and on a customized basis. As retail banking in the United States has struggled in the current low interest rate environment, with too few creditworthy customers eager to increase their borrowing and help banks boost their profits, institutions like Wells Fargo increasingly viewed selling more products as the best way to increase earnings. If they couldn\u2019t make more on the same number of products, well, they\u2019d just increase the number of products. And so they put in place the kind of bizarrely high targets that prompted those \u201crogue\u201d employees to begin opening fake accounts. Even after they were aware of what was happening, those targets remained in place; even when Stumpf first testified to Congress, the targets were still (theoretically, at least) what Wells Fargo bankers had to hit each day/week/month. You don\u2019t need a Jenga game, or Anthony Bourdain cooking a fish stew, Margot Robbie languishing in a bubble bath, or any other tortured metaphor, to explain the concept and just what is wrong with this picture. Similarly, Morgan Stanley allegedly crossed the lines by running cross-selling contests for brokers in five offices in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The brokers could win as much as $5,000 for convincing customers to take out as many as 30 loans against securities portfolios. Although the firm\u2019s own rules banned the contests, the compliance office didn\u2019t figure out what was going on for a year, until the end of 2014. Even then, the contests didn\u2019t stop until April 2015, according to the complaint filed by William Galvin, secretary of the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, the contests generated $24m in new loans for Morgan Stanley, Galvin said. A spokesman for Morgan Stanley has said the complaint is without merit and that the bank plans to defend itself vigorously. The loans were only open after discussing the product with each client, he added. That distinguishes it from Wells Fargo, whose clients had no idea that accounts were being opened in their name. On the other hand, did Morgan Stanley\u2019s clients know that their brokers were competing \u2013 and being paid \u2013 to open these new loan accounts? That the reason they were being offered the product might have as much or more to do with the broker\u2019s own financial wellbeing as with their own real needs? (Did they really need a new loan? Or the risk associated with taking out a loan against a securities portfolio when the market is near what seems likely to be its peak?) I suspect not. Thomas Curry, the US comptroller of the currency, has warned other banks to review their own cross-selling practices and has told Congress that his own staff will be evaluating what the largest banks are up to in this respect. It\u2019s about time. Hopefully, he\u2019ll report back with the answers. At least, when he does, we\u2019ll all understand what he\u2019s talking about. At the end of the day, it\u2019s really not much different than the high-pressure telephone sales guy who simply will not hang up or go away. Only because it\u2019s your banker who\u2019s putting you on the spot, you\u2019re a particularly vulnerable kind of captive audience who can\u2019t just hang up.",

Why? Partly because of <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/why-havent-bankers-been-punished-just-read-these-insider-sec-emails\">the way the bankers dodged and dived</a>, of course. And partly because the issues involved just didn\u2019t make it easy for anyone to catch a dodging, weaving banker, advised by a canny, high-priced lawyer. </p> <p>It just wasn\u2019t that easy for some of the non-specialists on Senate and House committees to be as effective as they might have liked in pillorying the finance industry when the subject was the way in which traders had rigged the Libor rate (the interbank borrowing rate against which the interest rates on most loans are benchmarked), say, or the precise way in which a hedge fund participated in selecting investments in a derivative sold to a pension fund client. It\u2019s even hard to explain how some of that stuff affected ordinary Americans (even though it did \u2013 ultimately, and sometimes indirectly.) </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/us-money-blog/2016/sep/17/elizabeth-warren-financial-crash-letter-doj\">Elizabeth Warren is still mad about the financial crash, and we should be too</a> </p> </aside>  <p> So let\u2019s be grateful that the banks have finally provided us with a scandal that we can understand, and to the regulators, for (belatedly) addressing a real problem that too many Americans grapple with daily. </p> <p> The Wells Fargo mess is the poster child for it all. Last month, the bank \u2013 one of the oldest in the country, with a tradition dating back to the Pony Express \u2013 disclosed that it would fork over $185m in penalties to regulators after an audit discovered that employees opened as many as 2m deposit and credit accounts in customers\u2019 names but without their consent. </p> <p> Testifying before Congress, John Stumpf, the bank\u2019s CEO and chairman, made much of the breach of trust on the part of more than 5,000 employees who opened the accounts, in an attempt to meeting sales quotas, either earning bonuses or simply holding on to their jobs. While initially he backed away from suggestions that he himself might have been held accountable, last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/27/wells-fargo-sales-tactics-investigation-john-stumpf\">he discovered he will share some of their pain</a>: independent directors announced they will implement salary and bonus clawbacks, and Stumpf\u2019s own compensation will be on hold while the directors investigate.</p> <p> But Wells isn\u2019t the only venerable Wall Street name to run afoul of regulators in recent days. Morgan Stanley, too, appears to have been putting pressure on its brokers to engage in \u201cdishonest and unethical conduct\u201d, according to the top securities regulator of Massachusetts, pushing them to cross-sell products.</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cross-sell.asp\">Cross-selling</a> is at the heart of both the Wells Fargo and the Morgan Stanley scandals, and unlike CDOs and credit default swaps, it\u2019s something that any bank customer can understand all too easily. If you\u2019ve ever walked into a bank \u2013 or talked to a bank representative on the phone \u2013 and had him suggest that you might want to consider opening a new account or that a different product might be just perfect for your needs, when you really just called to reset your pin or check your balance, well, you\u2019ve encountered cross-selling.</p> <p> There\u2019s nothing wrong with it as a business strategy. In fact, it\u2019s eminently logical, and can even be good for customers, to make them aware of products or services that might be out there and fit their needs. But it only works well when it\u2019s done carefully and on a customized basis. </p> <p> As <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32b989ac-870f-11e6-a75a-0c4dce033ade\">retail banking in the United States has struggled</a> in the current low interest rate environment, with too few creditworthy customers eager to increase their borrowing and help banks boost their profits, institutions like Wells Fargo increasingly viewed selling more products as the best way to increase earnings. If they couldn\u2019t make more on the same number of products, well, they\u2019d just increase the number of products. And so they put in place the kind of bizarrely high targets that prompted those \u201crogue\u201d employees to begin opening fake accounts. Even after they were aware of what was happening, those targets remained in place; even when Stumpf first testified to Congress, the targets were still (theoretically, at least) what Wells Fargo bankers had to hit each day/week/month.</p> <p> You <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/12/finance-big-short/420903/\">don\u2019t need a Jenga game</a>, or Anthony Bourdain cooking a fish stew, Margot Robbie languishing in a bubble bath, or any other tortured metaphor, to explain the concept and just what is wrong with this picture. </p> <p> Similarly, Morgan Stanley allegedly crossed the lines <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-morganstanley-massachusetts-idUSKCN1231KD\">by running cross-selling contests for brokers in five offices</a> in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The brokers could win as much as $5,000 for convincing customers to take out as many as 30 loans against securities portfolios. Although the firm\u2019s own rules banned the contests, the compliance office didn\u2019t figure out what was going on for a year, until the end of 2014. Even then, the contests didn\u2019t stop until April 2015, according to the complaint filed by William Galvin, secretary of the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, the contests generated $24m in new loans for Morgan Stanley, Galvin said. </p> <p> A spokesman for Morgan Stanley has said the complaint is without merit and that the bank plans to defend itself vigorously. The loans were only open after discussing the product with each client, he added.</p> <p> That distinguishes it from Wells Fargo, whose clients had no idea that accounts were being opened in their name. On the other hand, did Morgan Stanley\u2019s clients know that their brokers were competing \u2013 and being paid \u2013 to open these new loan accounts? That the reason they were being offered the product might have as much or more to do with the broker\u2019s own financial wellbeing as with their own real needs? (Did they really need a new loan? Or the risk associated with taking out a loan against a securities portfolio when the market is near what seems likely to be its peak?) I suspect not.</p> <p> Thomas Curry, the US comptroller of the currency, has <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-regulation-idUSKCN11L2U0\">warned other banks to review their own cross-selling practices</a> and has told Congress that his own staff will be evaluating what the largest banks are up to in this respect. It\u2019s about time. Hopefully, he\u2019ll report back with the answers. At least, when he does, we\u2019ll all understand what he\u2019s talking about. At the end of the day, it\u2019s really not much different than the high-pressure telephone sales guy who simply will not hang up or go away. Only because it\u2019s your banker who\u2019s putting you on the spot, you\u2019re a particularly vulnerable kind of captive audience who can\u2019t just hang up. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England and other central banks are scrutinising the dramatic dive in the pound on Friday to establish what drove sterling to new 31-year low in a trading incident that has had repercussions across global markets. The trading incident appears to have lasted for about four minutes in early Asian trading, compounding the losses that sterling had already suffered following speculation that Britain is heading for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d. The Bank, which had been on alert for the impact of computer trading on markets, said: \u201cWe are looking at the causes of the sharp falls overnight.\u201d Governor Mark Carney has asked the Bank for International Settlements - which represents the world\u2019s central banks \u2013 to review the events which took pace in the early hours of Friday morning. \u201cWith input from the Bank, the [BIS markets] committee will review the lessons from this, and other recent episodes of flash events in foreign exchange markets at its next meeting,\u201d the Bank said. At one point the pound dropped 10% from $1.26 to $1.15, its lowest level since March 1985, in a matter of minutes as Asia opened for business. . It regained some of its losses and was down 1.4% at $1.2440 as London closed for the weekend. While traders continued their postmortems, a strategist at HSBC, David Bloom, said: \u201cThe currency is now the de facto official opposition to the government\u2019s policies. \u201cTo us, the foreign exchange market is exhibiting an uncanny resemblance to the five stages of grief. First, following the Brexit vote came the denial \u2013 theories circulated whether a second referendum would have to take place. Second was anger \u2013 claims the vote was unfair. Third was the bargaining \u2013 arguments maybe it wouldn\u2019t be that bad, what if the UK followed the Norwegian or Switzerland model. Now, the fourth \u2013 a gloom is prevailing over the pound. It\u2019s become an uncomfortable reality to the market, post the Conservative conference, that the UK will embark on a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019.\u201d Bloom said he expects the pound to be at $1.10 by the end of 2017. The fall in sterling helped propel the FTSE 100 44 points higher to 7044. The blue-chip index tends to rise when sterling falls, because most of the constituent companies earn the majority of their money in dollars, rather than pounds. The market mayhem in the currency markets \u2013 where \u00a33.5tn changes hands each day \u2013 had an immediate impact on retailer Sports Direct, which said the flash crash would cost \u00a315m. Currency brokers and traders may also be totting up any losses. As the currency rallied, there was speculation that a technical glitch or human error had caused a flurry of computer-driven orders. Naeem Aslam, the chief market analyst at currency trader Think Markets, said: \u201cWhat we had was insane \u2013 call it flash crash, but the move of this magnitude really tells you how low the currency can really go. Hard Brexit has haunted sterling.\u201d The Bank of England has previously highlighted the impact of trading algorithms. \u201cSome markets appear to have become more fragile, as evidenced by episodes of short-term volatility and illiquidity over the past couple of years,\u201d Threadneedle Street said last December, warning of a move towards \u201cfast, electronic trading.\u201d The foreign exchange market is largely unregulated, but central bank policymakers will want to know the reasons for the sudden currency move. One theory is that dealers, or computer trading systems, were reacting to a Financial Times article in which the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said Britain would have to \u201csuffer\u201d for the Brexit vote in order to ensure EU unity. Some algorithms have been designed to feed off news headlines and social media, meaning that the programmes can be affected by human factors. Hollande\u2019s comments at an EU dinner in Paris came after the British prime minister, Theresa May, hinted that the UK was moving towards a Brexit deal that could restrict its access to the European single market, but provide greater control over immigration levels. The pound has fallen by 13% against the dollar since Britain voted to leave the EU on 23 June. The losses accelerated after May announced on Sunday that she would trigger article 50 by March 2017, beginning the UK\u2019s formal exit. Sean Callow, a senior currency strategist at Australian bank Westpac, noted that sterling had been \u201con a precipice\u201d since May\u2019s speech at the Conservative party conference. \u201cI think we\u2019ve underestimated how many people had money positions for a very wishy-washy Brexit, or even none,\u201d he said. Speaking in Hong Kong on Friday, the Conservative MP Mark Garnier, a minister at the Department for International Trade, said: \u201cClearly it\u2019s [the falling pound] to do with the [Brexit] vote, but actually it\u2019s not an unwelcome reaction. Sterling is probably about where it should be. We\u2019re just going through a relatively short period of volatility. \u201cWe\u2019ve probably found stability at this level. What we don\u2019t want is to see it jumping around 5% on a weekly basis \u2013 nobody wants their currency to be volatile.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK industrial output declines while trade deficit widens", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s industrial output fell in August and the trade deficit widened, according to official figures that break a run of upbeat reports on the UK\u2019s post-referendum economy. The reports were weaker than economists had been predicting but they said the UK economy remained on course to avoid a downturn in the Brexit vote\u2019s aftermath by a significant margin. The Office for National Statistics said industrial production fell 0.4% in August after a 0.1% increase in July. That compared economists\u2019 forecasts of another 0.1% increase, in a Reuters poll. But there was evidence that exports were helped by the weak pound, which touched new 31-year lows against the dollar on Friday amid worries over the UK\u2019s prospects outside the EU. Within the industrial sector, manufacturers raised output by 0.2% on the month, boosted by car production. But output fell in other parts of the industrial sector in August. \u201cManufacturing output was up slightly in August with more cars built, with limited evidence suggesting the lower pound boosted exports,\u201d said the ONS\u2019s senior statistician, Kate Davies. \u201cNevertheless, this was offset by a fall in oil and gas production, with some field shutdowns contributing to the fall, meaning UK production as a whole was down.\u201d Following the figures, the thinktank, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), estimated economic growth slowed in the third quarter to 0.4%, from 0.7% in the second quarter. \u201cWhile retail sales have been buoyant in recent months, the production sector has acted as a drag on economic growth,\u201d said James Warren, research fellow at NIESR. Separate figures showed the UK\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened in August as exports continued to rise but imports grew at a faster rate. Concerns about the UK\u2019s trading prospects have risen this week after comments from ministers suggested the government could pursue a hard Brexit deal that limits immigration but leaves Britain shut out from the single market. Those fears have helped knock the pound sharply lower on foreign exchanges. Liam Fox, international trade secretary, insisted the government was \u201cworking hard to ensure the UK remains an attractive place with which to trade and to help UK companies take advantage of the global demand for British goods and services\u201d. \u201cWhile some sectors continue to perform well, there is still some way to go to ensure that we are exporting as much as we could and should do, so the government will continue to encourage and support the wider range of exporting we require to boost our national prosperity,\u201d Fox said. But businesses and lobby groups say the government should do more if it wants to come anywhere close to a goal to almost double UK exports to \u00a31tn by 2020 \u2013 a target it is widely expected to miss. \u201cThe chancellor\u2019s autumn statement needs to include measures that support businesses looking to access new export markets, including expanding support for trade fairs and missions, to at least match that provided by our competitors,\u201d said Mike Spicer, director of research and economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. The ONS estimated the UK\u2019s deficit on trade in goods and services at \u00a34.7bn in August, a widening of \u00a32.5bn from July. Exports increased by \u00a30.1bn and imports increased by \u00a32.6bn. The deficit on trade in goods alone was \u00a312.1bn, widening by \u00a32.6bn from July and worse than the \u00a311.3bn gap forecast by economists in the Reuters poll. The deficit on trade in goods with EU countries hit a record high of \u00a38.4bn as imports from the bloc rose 5.1% and exports fell 0.6%. The two reports on trade and industrial production follow signs in surveys that businesses had rebounded from the initial shock of June\u2019s vote to leave the EU. Statisticians caution against over-interpreting any one month\u2019s figures, however. The data will give Bank of England policymakers more to chew over when they meet next month to decide whether to cut interest rates further from the already record low of 0.25%. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee reduced borrowing costs and expanded an electronic money-printing scheme in August to shore up confidence after the Brexit vote. Commenting on the latest official figures, Scott Bowman at the consultancy Capital Economics said: \u201cWhile these figures break the recent run of positive data for activity in the third quarter, the overall strength of recent data has probably lowered the chance of further monetary easing from the MPC. \u201cBut committee members have previously warned against over-interpreting incoming data \u2013 including Ben Broadbent in his speech this week \u2013 so we still think that there is a decent chance that the bank rate will be cut to 0.10% in November.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Traders were baffled by the overnight \u201cflash crash\u201d in the pound, with theories emerging about what happened to send the currency over the edge. The pound fell by 6% to $1.1378, having dropped by 10% before one of the more outlying major trades was cancelled. Analysts pointed to possible causes including rogue computer trades, an accidental \u201cfat finger\u201d transaction and tough comments from the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, on Brexit negotiations. The most popular theories revolve around algorithmic trading, also known as black box trading. Traders on financial markets are influenced by emotion and instinct, while the limits of the human brain and body mean people can only trade at a certain speed and frequency. Algorithmic trading aims to eliminate human failings by programming a computer to carry out trades based on instructions tailored to a range of scenarios. For instance, the algorithm might be set to sell a currency automatically when its average value over 50 days falls below the average value over 200 days. Several market commentators believe that an overzealous algorithm may have been partly responsible for the overnight sterling crash. While algorithmic trading is supposed to help smooth market volatility by increasing the volume of trades, its automated nature can lead to unexpected and sizeable transactions that move markets significantly. Some algorithms have been designed to feed off news headlines and social media, meaning they can still be affected by human herd mentality. Analysts at City Index said: \u201cApparently it was a rogue algorithm that triggered the sell-off after it picked up comments made by the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who said if Theresa May and company want \u2018hard Brexit\u2019, they will get hard Brexit.\u201d City Index said a sell-off triggered by Twitter-reading algorithms could have been exacerbated by a different group of \u201ctechnical\u201d algorithms that sell once a currency falls below a certain level. Thus, algorithmic trading could have set off a vicious circle in which the pound\u2019s slump became a self-fulfilling prophecy. The effect was also fuelled by the fact that it happened overnight, when only the Asian, Australian and New Zealand markets were open, and trading was particularly thin due to uncertainty about forthcoming US jobs data. Lower trading volumes mean single trades have a bigger effect on what is going on in the market, because there is less other activity to balance out big movements. Some market watchers have also speculated that a fat finger trade, where someone accidentally omits a decimal point or types the wrong number, could have been a factor. In 2014, Japanese stock markets were plunged into chaos when a smaller trade accidentally became a $617bn (\u00a3494bn) trade, while a big drop in the FTSE 100 this time last year was blamed on a fat finger error.",

While algorithmic trading is supposed to help smooth market volatility by increasing the volume of trades, its automated nature can lead to unexpected and sizeable transactions that move markets significantly.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3bbf8004-7ad9-42ba-97de-0d93d6656ade\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Explainer\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Some algorithms have been designed to feed off news headlines and social media, meaning they can still be affected by human herd mentality.</p> \n<p>Analysts at City Index said: \u201cApparently it was a rogue algorithm that triggered the sell-off after it picked up comments made by the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who said if Theresa May and company want \u2018hard Brexit\u2019, they will get hard Brexit.\u201d </p> \n<p>City Index said a sell-off triggered by Twitter-reading algorithms could have been exacerbated by a different group of \u201ctechnical\u201d algorithms that sell once a currency falls below a certain level.<br></p> \n<p>Thus, algorithmic trading could have set off a vicious circle in which the pound\u2019s slump became a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p> \n<p>The effect was also fuelled by the fact that it happened overnight, when only the Asian, Australian and New Zealand markets were open, and trading was particularly thin due to uncertainty about forthcoming US jobs data.</p> \n<p>Lower trading volumes mean single trades have a bigger effect on what is going on in the market, because there is less other activity to balance out big movements.</p> \n<p>Some market watchers have also speculated that a fat finger trade, where someone accidentally omits a decimal point or types the wrong number, could have been a factor.</p> \n<p>In 2014, Japanese stock markets were plunged into chaos when a smaller trade accidentally became a $617bn (\u00a3494bn) trade, while a big drop in the FTSE 100 this time last year was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/18/fat-finger-trade-suspected-ftse-100-fall\">blamed on a fat finger error</a>.</p>",
