      "bodyText": "Politicians in Jersey have voted to ban so-called vulture funds from using the island's courts to sue the world's poorest countries for historic debts. Vulture funds, which buy up poor nations' debts on the cheap before suing them for up to 100 times the original amount, had attempted to take cases to Jersey after British law banned the practice. In the latest case, multimillionaire speculator Peter Grossman used Jersey's courts to sue the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) for $100m (\u00a364m) over a decades-old debt that started out at $3.3m. Grossman, who runs the FG Hemisphere fund, was able to take the case to Jersey's courts because the island is a crown dependency not covered by all UK laws. The Jersey court ruled the DRC's state-owned mining company should pay back the debt, which was originally a loan from the former Yugoslavia to build power lines 30 years ago. The judgment was eventually overturned by the privy council, the final court of appeal for Crown dependencies. Jersey's chief minister, Ian Gorst, said the island's decision to change its laws so they fall in line with those in the UK sent a clear message that Jersey was a \"well-regulated, co-operative and transparent jurisdiction\". All but one of Jersey's parliamentarians voted in favour of changing the law to severely limit vulture funds' claims on debts owed by 40 of the world's poorest countries. The remaining member of the States of Jersey abstained from the vote on Tuesday. \"I am very pleased that the debt relief legislation received such strong support from my fellow States members,\" Gorst said. \"Today's vote shows that Jersey is fully committed to supporting international debt relief efforts.\" When the draft legislation was lodged last month, Gorst said the law would show Jersey is \"demonstrating its commitment to play its part in the global effort, expressed in the UN Millennium Declaration, to support debt relief efforts intended to assist the world's most heavily indebted poor countries\". Draft legislation states that the change in the law will \"prevent the Jersey courts being used to seek to enforce in full, the debts of countries to which the governments of other countries, multilateral lenders and commercial creditors have provided relief under the [heavily indebted poor countries] initiative\". The UK is the only country in the world to have brought in a law to limit vulture funds practices, but other countries are considering similar proposals. The Treasury estimates the UK Debt Relief (Developing Countries) Act passed in 2010 will save some of the most impoverished countries \u00a3145m. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank estimate that vulture funds are seeking total claims of $1.47bn from countries including Cameroon, Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda, and the DRC. Tim Jones, policy officer at Jubilee Debt Campaign, which is campaigning for the cancellation of debts owed by poor countries, said: \"We warmly welcome this legislation to protect 40 countries from odious vulture fund claims in Jersey. However, vulture funds continue to cause havoc across the global economy. One case currently being heard in the US may even force Argentina to default on its debt. \"Global action is needed to make all creditors comply when government debts have to be written off.\" Last month, an Argentine naval ship was seized in Ghana as part of an attempt by a hedge fund run by US billionaire Paul Singer to collect on debts arising from the country's defaulted bond swaps in 2005 and 2010. Argentina has asked the United Nations to order the release of the Libertad tall ship, which has been prevented from leaving Ghana after a local court ruled in favour of Singer's Elliott Capital Management. During its 2001 economic crisis Argentina defaulted on more than $100bn of debt. Most of the loans were subsequently restructured, giving creditors back about 30p in the pound, but some creditors including Elliott, chose to hold out and pursue the Argentine government through courts across the world.",

Autonomy, in its independent life, was a company that seemed to be in perpetual war with half the City's analysts over accounting treatments. Even at the time of the takeover offer last year, technology specialists blogged furiously about aggressive revenue recognition, cash conversion and the like. And let's not forget the entertaining spat between Autonomy founder Mike Lynch and Oracle's Larry Ellison. In short, the message to Hewlett-Packard ought to have been obvious: if you are spending $10bn (\u00a36bn) on a company with annual sales of roughly $1bn you had better be damn sure the business is of the highest quality. Meg Whitman, Hewlett-Packard's chief executive, argued on Tuesday that all the right checks were made. KPMG was hired as an adviser to check on Autonomy's accounts, which were audited by Deloitte. Investment bankers at Barclays and Perella Weinberg gave a \"fair value\" opinion on Autonomy. And, yes, the company's management was aware of the internet rumours. So why did all these fine firms miss what Hewlett-Packard now claims was a misstatement of Autonomy's accounts? \"When you are lied to it is hard to find,\" said Whitman. Lynch denies the allegations in full so, inevitably, the matter will be settled in court. The facts will decide whether there was a \"wilful effort\" on the part of Autonomy's management to mislead investors and potential buyers. Even if that can be proved, however, Hewlett-Packard's investors might ask whether their management was too driven by the desire to do a deal, any deal, that offered the prospect of a fresh start. Remember the context here. Hewlett-Packard was a former computer titan fallen on hard times. Too many acquisitions, such as EDS and Palm, had turned sour and new-boy chief executive L\u00e9o Apotheker was desperate to find an instant fix. He decided to get out of making personal computers and buy Autonomy at an almighty takeover premium of 64%. The PC strategy was immediately reversed by Whitman, who arrived soon afterwards. But the price paid for Autonomy was otherworldly \u2013 it smacked of a management team that was too anxious to make a hardware-for-software switch.",

      "bodyText": "Those newsflashes from Brussels (see 7.32pm) suggest that the eurogroup meeting will last for hours yet -- and I don't think I can find enough photos of Jean-Claude Juncker pushing ministers around to fill the gap. So here's the state of play: \u2022 Eurozone finance ministers are locked in talks tonight over Greece's financial programme. The eurogroup meeting is considering whether, and when, to advance the next tranche of the Greek bailout -- and how to find extra funding to keep the rescue on track (see 5.25pm and 6.57pm for photos) Going into the talks, several key players said they were hopeful of a breakthough deal - but there was also caution (see 5pm and 4.05pm) There are reports tonight is that ministers will agree a compromise under which Greece is given until 2022 to hit debt targets, which would be tougher than the existing goal of a debt/GDP ratio of 120% by 2020 (see 4.33pm). The Greek government firmly hopes that it will be told when its aid tranche, worth up to \u20ac44bn, will be paid -- but doesn't expect the money until early December (see 12pm). \u2022 France has also been digesting the loss of its AAA rating at Moody's, following last night's downgrade (see 7.31am onwards). Finance minister Pierre Moscovici has insisted that Paris will deliver on its reforms, but one analyst warned that French borrowing costs could soon rise (see 9.42am). \u2022 Ben Bernanke warned that America could tumble back into recession unless there is a deal on the fiscal cliff soon. The Federal Reserve chair said that the US could enjoy a good 2013, if the looming fiscal crunch can be averted (see 6.48pm) \u2022 Financial markets clung onto yesterday's gains. Traders said there was optimism over Greece, and the US fiscal cliff (see 6.24pm for the closing prices) \u2022 Spain held a successful debt auction. Borrowing costs fell and demand was very solid \u2013 as Madrid continues to survive without external aid (see 9.59am) \u2022 There were more protests in Greece. Municipal workers marched in Athens, in protest at plans to lay off thousands of employees (see 3.45pm). If there is action in Brussels tonight, our website will cover all the details. Otherwise, I'll be back in the morning for more of the same. Thanks, and goodnight! News from Brussels: the eurogroup meeting has been 'paused' while officials from the eurozone and the Troika prepare new proposals. That's according to the latest news flashes from Reuters, which reports that ministers haven't agreed on anything yet: \u2022 EU OFFICIAL SAYS EURO ZONE FINANCE MINISTERS AIM TO BRING GREEK DEBT DOWN TO 120 PCT/GDP IN 2020 \u2022 EURO ZONE MINISTERS CONSIDERING GRANTING GREECE 10-YEAR MORATORIUM ON INTEREST PAYMENTS ON EFSF LOANS, THIS WOULD SAVE ATHENS 44 BLN EUROS-EU OFFICIAL \u2022EURO ZONE MINISTERS DISCUSSING CUTTING INTEREST ON BILATERAL LOANS TO GREECE TO 25 BPS FROM 150 BPS, GERMANY OBJECTS \u2022 EURO ZONE MINISTERS' DISCUSSION OF GREEK DEBT BUY-BACK IDEA SHIFTING FROM 25 CENTS FOR ONE EURO TO 30 CENTS PER EURO, TO BUY 35-40 BLN EUROS OF DEBT-EU OFFICIAL \u2022 EURO ZONE MINISTERS HAVE MADE NO DECISIONS YET ON ANY OF THE TOPICS-EU OFFICIAL \u2022 EURO ZONE MINISTERS PAUSE MEETING FOR EU/IMF TROIKA TEAM TO PREPARE NEW PROPOSALS-EU OFFICIAL A couple more entertaining photos from the eurogroup meeting: And here's one from earlier (which I missed) of Christine Lagarde on her way into the meeting, telling reporters that the eurogroup will work \"very constructively\" on a Greek deal. My colleague on Wall Street, Dominic Rushe, has the full story on Ben Bernanke's speech this afternoon. Speaking at the New York Economic Club, Bernanke called the US recovery \"disappointingly slow\". He added: \"Indeed, since the recession trough in mid-2009, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) has averaged only a little more than 2% per year.\" He acknowledged some positive indicators: the job market continues to improve, inflation remains low and the housing market appears to be improving. But Bernanke said the Federal Reserve remained concerned about the fragility of the recovery, not least because of threats from abroad. \"The elevated levels of stress in European economies and uncertainty about how the problems there will be resolved are adding to the risks that US financial institutions, businesses, and households must consider when making lending and investment decisions,\" Bernanke said. After the early excitement, Europe's financial markets ended up taking Moody's one-notch downgrade of France's credit rating (see 7.31am onwards) in their stride. French bond yields have weakened a little, pushing up the yield on 10-year sovereign debt by eight basis points to 2.15%. The euro is also calm, hovering around the $1.28 mark (pretty much where it was before Moody's struck). Most European stock markets also ended the day in positive territory . FTSE 100: up 10 points at 5748, +0.18% German DAX: up 49 points at 7172, +0.69% French CAC: up 22 points at 3462, + 0.6% Spanish IBEX: up 14 points at 7778, + 0.2% Italian FTSE MIB: down 38 points at 15269, - 0.25% Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, explained that hope overcame fear in the City today. The markets have been able to weather everything thrown at them, stubbornly holding on to the gains made yesterday on hopes of progress in US fiscal cliff negotiations. Last night\u2019s downgrade of France by Moody\u2019s has been ignored with an appropriately Gallic shrug, since it doesn\u2019t exactly spell doom for the French economy. Over in New York, Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke has weighed in on the other issue looming over the world economy - the US fiscal cliff. Bernanke told The Economic Club of New York that America could be pulled into recession unless politicians reach a deal over the expiring tax cuts and spending reductions that are due to hit in January. But with \"co-operation and creativity\", Bernanke added, 2013 could actually be \"a very good one for the American economy.\" Bernanke trod a careful course on the fiscal cliff (sensibly!), pointing out that the US \"urgently needs\" a long-term path towards a more stable fiscal policy. However now is not the time to put new \"fiscal headwinds\" in the way of the recovery... Doesn't sound like anything he's not said before - but it might keep the pressure on Washington to make some progress. Finally, some photos from the Eurogroup meeting have just arrived, as the major players get ready for business. The mood appears to be cordial and resolute: France's finance minister Pierre Moscovici has also arrived for the Eurogroup meeting, telling reporters that political agreement on Greece is 'within reach'. Moscovici then neatly joined together the two strands of today's eurocrisis story, by saying that Moody's decision to cut France's credit rating had given Paris more impetus to find a deal on Greece's aid programme. If so, it's a shame Moody's didn't act weeks ago.... The Financial Times is now reporting that the Eurogroup is \"close to a deal\" on Greece. Interestingly, it has details of a compromise plan that might find favour with the International Monetary Fund: While the details are still under negotiation, the shape of the potential deal involves Greece missing its target of maximum debt of 120 per cent of gross domestic product by 2020 \u2013 a benchmark of \u201cdebt sustainability\u201d the IMF regards as sacrosanct. But additional debt relief measures would ensure that by 2022 Greece\u2019s debt would fall to less than 110 per cent of GDP. Last week, Eurogroup chair Jean-Claude Juncker and IMF head Christine Lagarde clashed publicly over whether the 120% target should be shunted back by two years to 2022 (he said \"yes\", she said \"not a chance\"). A new target of debt/GDP of below 110% in 2022 does, at first glance, sound like an serious attempt to persuade the IMF that Greece's debts are on a sustainable path - just over a longer journey than it would like. Eurozone finance ministers and top officials are flooding into this afternoon's eurogroup meeting, and giving some choice quotes to the media as they arrive. Here's a round-up of the best: Germany's Wolfgang Schauble cautioned that ministers would need to seek permission from their national parliaments for any credible deal that gives Greece more time: EC commissioner Olli Rehn said that Greece had done its bit, by proving it is serious about reforms. Europe must now clear the 'uncertainty' over its future. Irish finance minister Michael Noonan denied that ministers had fallen out last week, saying there was only a 'difference of opinion'* Greek municipal workers have been holding fresh protests in Athens today, angry about sweeping job cuts imposed by Greece's lenders in return for continued aid. AP reports that more 2,000 local government workers took part in a demonstration in the Greek capital. As we wrote yesterday, hundreds of buildings were taken over yesterday, to prevent the implementation of new rules that put employees in labour pools, prior to dismissal Here are some photos from the scene, which highlights the depth of public anger over Greece's financial programme. The Wall Street Journal has created a rather fine Cheat Sheet for today's eurogroup meeting, explaining the four issues which finance ministers need to solve before they can extend Greece its next bailout payment. They are: \u2022 Debt sustainability. How, and when, Greece's national debt comes down to 120% of GDP? (this is the most complicated issue, with haircuts, buybacks and loan extensions all on the table) \u2022 Next Loan Installment. Will it be \u20ac31.5bn, or \u20ac44bn? (Athens hopes the latter, as we wrote at 12.00). And how quickly will it be delivered? \u2022 Financing Gap.How will the black hole in Greece's finances (\u20ac15bn between now and 2014, and another \u20ac17bn to 2016) be filled? \u2022 Sovereignty.How much more will Greece have to surrender in return for continued help? Worth reading. Eurozone finance ministers are arriving in Brussels for the eurogroup meeting. The new Dutch finance minister has told the press pack that he is hoping for a Greek deal tonight provided it's \"a good deal\" Jeroen Dijsselbloem added that a deal needs to fit within Greece's current programme, before conceding that the country may yet cost the eurozone more money. Greece needs its next aid tranche to ensure its political stability in the months ahead, Release of the funds is not only vital for revitalizing an economy heading into a sixth year of recession but reinforcing Athens\u2019 shaky-looking governing coalition, explains our correspondent Helena Smith: Friction has been such that following talks between Antonis Samaras and his junior partners late Monday, all three party leaders agreed on the urgent need to create a committee to better coordinate the government\u2019s work. A reshuffle is also on the cards although officials are now saying Samaras\u2019 intention is to create the committee, to be comprised of nine members \u2013 three from each party \u2013 first. Addressing reporters after talks with Samaras, the leader of the small Democratic Left party, Fotis Kouvellis said it was critical that the coalition worked more smoothly towards creating \u201ca viable and social program\u201d that would place more emphasis on growth once the \u20ac44.6bn aid package was secured. Samaras has received a boost in the first poll to be held following parliament\u2019s passage of draconian belt-tightening measures last week \u2013 with the GPO survey suggesting that the majority of Greeks regarded the conservative as being by far the best choice for PM. However, an overwhelming 63% said they believed the coalition had handled the crisis negatively. Support for the common currency \u2013 once unshakeable \u2013 had dropped from a high of 81.6% before the June general election to 63% with some 78% of Greeks telling pollsters that they did not think more pay and pension cuts would help stabilise the economy. Helena explains; Pressure on the government has mounted as the main opposition Syriza party, which is leading in the polls, has upped the ante. Senior cades in the leftist party say it is now only a matter of time before the government collapses under the weight of popular outrage over the measures. \u201cAs they say the proof of the pudding is in the eating,\u201d said Georgios Aufantis, the party\u2019s diplomatic adviser, referring to the \u20ac13.5 bn package of pay and pension cuts that will be enforced as of January. \u201cGreece is like a piece of parched land, all it will take is a spark for it to go up in flames.\u201d Predicting social upheaval, Panos Skourletis said it was only \u201ca question of months\u201d before Greece was forced to hold elections again and Syriza assumed power. Just in: Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the eurogroup (and prime minister of Luxembourg) has declared that Greece has delivered on its commitments and said he sees \"\"Good chances\" of a substantive deal tonight. That's encouraging. However, Juncker did then backtrack a little, saying he couldn't be certain of a breakthough... Moody's downgrade of France has forced the European Financial Stability Facility (the temporary bailout fund being replaced by the European Stability Fund) to delay a bond sale. The EFSF had been planning to sell a three-year Aaa/AA+/AAA bond today, but has now halted the plan, Reuters has established. Legal hitches are to blame -- it appears that the bond can't be described as Aaa/AA+/AAA now that France (one of the bond's guaranters) is only triple-A rated with Fitch. That's a little embarrassing \u2013 and also highlights one of the problems with the eurozone strategy: it's hard for the core to protect the periphery once it has been dragged deeper into the crisis. Sticking with the eurogroup meeting -- there are also reports that the agenda for tonight's meeting has been cut back to simply considering Greece's funding gap to 2014, not to 2016 (even though Athens has been given those two extra years to bring its deficit into line). That would mean eurozone finance ministers would only need to tackle a smaller funding gap (\u20ac15bn not \u20ac32bn), making a potential deal easier. However, the IMF might not be satisfied with this piecemeal approach. Another rumour is that the Troika has considered extending Greece\u2019s repayment terms by another decade, to to 2032. ...by which time many of the participants in this crisis could well be dead. as Paul Murphy of FT Alphaville points out here (spoiler alert). Over to Greece where our correspondent Helena Smith says finance ministry officials say they expect \u201can agreement in principle\u201d to be reached over the release of rescue funds at today\u2019s euro group meeting Helena writes: Greek officials say while a full-scale agreement may still be elusive -- with the approval of it next aid tranche unlikely to be finalized -- the debt-stricken country will almost certainly be given a time-frame as to the release of the bumper \u20ac44.6bn rescue package. Insiders are confirming reports that the most likely date for the disbursement of the funds is December 5th with the green light finally being given at a euro group meeting already scheduled for December 3rd. \u201cThat is going to be the most crucial meeting for final decisions,\u201d said one well-placed source. \u201cAt today\u2019s meeting [eurogroup] finance ministers will be briefed by the troika on the commitments the government has made regarding implementation of reforms so an agreement in principle can be reached.\u201d The state-run TV channel NET is also reporting that the \u201csuper tranche\u201d will arrive in Athens after the revised bailout accord has been signed between Greece and its creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF on December 4th. Helena continues: \u201cToday, we are expecting to learn when we will get the money,\u201d one well-placed finance ministry official told me. \u201cNeedless to say we want it as soon as possible and also, if at all possible, in one installment.\u201d Greece\u2019s coalition government has made no secret of the fact that it is hoping a \u20ac31.5bn cash injection put on hold since June \u2013 mostly because of political paralysis spawned by double elections \u2013 will be boosted by two other tranches, amounting to almost \u20ac13bn that are also due to be drawn down from bailout funds before the end of the year. Prime minister Antonis Samaras says the extra funds are crucial to re-energising an economy that has shrunk by almost 20 % since the outbreak of the debt crisis in Athens late 2009. \"We are totally ready for the meeting,\" says the Greek finance minister Yiannis Stournaras. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany's finance minister, has told the country's parliament that people shouldn't panic about France's downgrade. Speaking to the Bundestag, Sch\u00e4uble said: We got the news last night that our most important partner had received a small warning from a ratings agency. France's rating is still stable, one shouldn't over-dramatise this. We all have an interest in everyone in Europe living up to their responsibilities. At the risk of over-dramatising....France's AA1 rating isn't completely stable, given Moody's has left it with a negative outlook and warned of another downgrade if the crisis worsens (see 9.42am) Sch\u00e4uble also warned that Germany's economy faces growing threats: The economic situation is weakening...That is not only the case in Europe, but worldwide. And on this afternoon's eurogroup meeting, Sch\u00e4uble promised that finance ministers would make \"every effort\" to deliver a sustainable solution for Greece. Eurozone finance ministers are due in Brussels this afternoon for their talks on Greece, but the meeting isn't due to kick off until 5pm local time (or 4pm GMT) So, a quick show of hands and they could be finished before the European stock markets close for the day.... ..but alas, the Brussels press corp expect a long session. France's finance minister Pierre Moscovici faced a media scrum this morning after he responded to Moody's downgrade, as the photo above shows. As I wrote at 7.57am, Moscovici insisted that France's economy was still sound. He also declared that we should wait to see how the government performs, declaring: Judge us on our results. And I'm sure we all will! Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, makes an interesting point about the muted reaction to France's downgrade \u2013 if the financial markets aren't worried, perhaps the UK government shouldn't fret about losing its own AAA: The other case study here is America \u2013 which was downgraded by S&amp;P in August 2011, and suffered precisely no ill effect. Just in: Spain has held a successful-looking debt auction, raising almost \u20ac5bn of debt at lower borrowing costs. Here are the details: \u20ac4.22bn of 12-month bills sold at an average yield of 2.797%, down from 2.823% in October. \u20ac710m of 28-month bills at an average yield of 3.034%, down from 3.022% in October. That means Spain beat its target of raising a maximum of \u20ac4.5bn. The 18-month auction was heavily oversubscribed, with a bid-to-cover ratio of 5.7 (so Madrid could have sold almost six times as much debt). The 12-month auction had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.1. So Spain continues to finance herself - meaning no immediate pressure to seek financial aid. The euro has taken France's downgrade in its stride \u2013 down just 0.16 of a cent against the US dollar at $1.279. Global macro strategist Kit Juckes isn't impressed: Back on France.... and sovereign bond expert Nick Spiro warns that French debt is ripe for a correction. Spiro believes that French debt looks \"more and more overvalued relative to fundamentals\", and believes Moody's downgrade is belated, as: This is a \"Chirac/Sarkozy downgrade\" as much as a \"Hollande\" one. It would be harder for president Hollande to blame a subsequent downgrade on his predecessors, though. And another cut is a real risk. Moody's lead analyst on France, Dietmar Hornung, explained this morning that: We would downgrade the rating further in the event of additional material deterioration in France's economic prospects, or in a scenario in which there were difficulties in implementing the announced reforms. And that might have more impact than today's cut (see 8.43am for details of the muted reaction) Speaking of Greece...fingers are crossed in Athens that eurozone finance ministers will agreed to hand over its next slice of aid today. As journalist Efthimia Efthimiou puts it: Yesterday we were pretty confident that leaders would agree a 'tentative' deal in which Greece would receive \u20ac44bn of loans, perhaps in two tranches, as long as it satisfied the Eurogroup that it met all its obligations. However, Finnish finance minister Jutta Urpilainen has warned this morning that a deal is \"not certain\" Urpilainen told reporters in Helsinki that she wasn't sure that finance ministers would approve Greece's next loan tranche today: I'm not at all sure that it will happen. More information is needed before a decision can be made, so the situation is very much open. In the financial markets, shares have dropped back following yesterday's rally - with France's index one of the worst performers. Nothing too dramatic, though. French CAC: down 23 points at 3416, - 0.68% FTSE 100: down 16 points at 5721, - 0.3% German DAX: down 14 points at 7109, -0.2% Spanish IBEX: down 37 points at 7726, - 0.5% Italian FTSE MIB: down 133 points at 15177, - 0.8% City traders say there is nervousness about this afternoon's Eurogroup meeting on Greece (which kicks off around 4pm GMT). Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at stockbroker Interactive Investor, commented: The general consensus is that an agreement will be reached to smooth over the cracks but once again highlight the increasing discord amongst the member states and the IMF. Investors will remain cautious. Belgium's government has reached a deal on next year's budget, which is likely to contain around \u20ac3.7bn of austerity measures. The country's prime minister, Elio Di Rupo, tweeted this morning that the government has: an agreement on the 2013 budget and additional measures for competitiveness and employment. (he tweeted it in French too). Belgium is aiming to cut its deficit to 2.15% of GDP in 2013, which means a fiscal adjustment of around \u20ac3.7bn. Local media have predicted cuts to government spending and social security payments, and tax rises. A press conference is scheduled at 10am GMT to outline the details. Moody's downgrade has had virtually no impact on French sovereign debt this morning, with the yield in its 10-year bonds up just a smidgen at 2.09% (as reader IfigEusLannuon has already pointed out in the comments) Some City experts argue that we shouldn't fret about credit rating agencies at all, with fund manager @pawelmorski providing this graph showing that yields have actually fallen since S&amp;P downgraded France in January: The downgrade will have some impact, though. For starters, it might affect the credit rating of the European Stability Mechanism (the bailout fund is currently AAA), while pension funds have to consider that France is now officially a riskier bet (as it is now only AAA with Fitch). Still, as Brasilian points out in the comments below, it's not as bad as losing the 1982 World Cup with Socrates and Zico in your team. I can't imagine many French throwing their TVs out of the window when they see the news, so it can't be that bad. Russian economist Constantin Gurdgiev reckons France got off lightly: Axel Merk, president of Merk Investments in California, told Reuters overnight that the French government had only itself to blame: France is paying the price for not engaging in reform. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said the loss of the triple A rating is \"a blow to French prestige\", but won't have much impact on its economic outlook \u2013 given the wider economic challenges: Hewson added: It could however have a trickledown effect down through the French banking system, with potential downgrades for French banks, feeding through into higher borrowing costs, due to the perceived lower credit rating of the sovereign. Another important point in Moody's statement - it reckons that France's predictions of growth of 0.8% in 2013 and 2.0% from 2014 are \"overly optimistic\" On top of rising unemployment, France's consumption levels are being weighed down by tax increases, subdued disposable income growth and a correction in the housing market. That may be unwelcome news to Paris -- but it's worth remembering that the EC predicts growth of just 0.4% in 2013. France's finance minister has defended his government following Moody's downgrade. Pierre Moscovici insisted that the move did not put the French economy's 'economic fundamentals' into question, saying Hollande's administration was still committed to implementing reforms (such as the \u20ac20bn tax boost for businesses announced two weeks ago). UPDATE: Here's the key quote: The rating change does not call into question the economic fundamentals of our country, the efforts undertaken by the government or our creditworthiness. Moscovici added that Moody's was wrong to say that France's banks are vulnerable to a further deepening of the eurozone crisis, because of their exposure to weak members of the currency union. (On that last point \u2013 the French financial sector is known to be a big holder of peripheral euro debt. Back in June, France's banks held $40bn of Greek debt, for example, while German lenders' held $5.5bn and U.K. banks owned $5.6bn....) The full statement from Moody's can be read online, and includes this three-point explanation for downgrading France: \u2022 France's long-term economic growth outlook is negatively affected by multiple structural challenges, including its gradual, sustained loss of competitiveness and the long-standing rigidities of its labour, goods and service markets. \u2022 France's fiscal outlook is uncertain as a result of its deteriorating economic prospects, both in the short term due to subdued domestic and external demand, and in the longer term due to the structural rigidities noted above. \u2022 The predictability of France's resilience to future euro area shocks is diminishing in view of the rising risks to economic growth, fiscal performance and cost of funding. France's exposure to peripheral Europe through its trade linkages and its banking system is disproportionately large, and its contingent obligations to support other euro area members have been increasing. Moreover, unlike other non-euro area sovereigns that carry similarly high ratings, France does not have access to a national central bank for the financing of its debt in the event of a market disruption. Moody's adds though, that France still has its strengths - including a large, diverse economy and a government committed to reforms (even if it may struggle to implement them). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis. The big news overnight is that France has lost its Triple-A rating with Moody's. Late last night the credit rating agency announced that it has downgraded France by one notch to AA1, with a negative outlook. Moody's warned that the French government's fiscal position is worsening as its economy weakens, with significant 'structural challenges' hindering Paris as it tries to implement reforms. Moody's also shrugged at the government's economic reform plans, pointing out that: The track record of successive French governments in effecting such measures over the past two decades has been poor. Although France had already lost its AAA rating with Standard &amp; Poor's in January, Moody's decision is still a blow to Francois Hollande. As our Paris correspondent Kim Willsher writes: Moody's said it was not confident Hollande's government could \u2013 or would \u2013 introduce the necessary structural reforms and spending cuts to improved its rating in the medium term and expressed concern over France's exposure to risks from other ailing eurozone countries. Kim adds that France was already smarting over this week's edition of The Economist: Its special report warned that the parlous state of the French economy, its rising unemployment, lack of competitiveness, dwindling industry and high public spending, could overshadow the problems of Greece or Spain, and sparked angry reactions from French ministers. Moody's decision comes as eurozone finance ministers head to Brussels for another meeting on Greece \u2013 this could be the day that they decide to advance its long-awaited aid tranche, and agree how to finance the two-year extension to its financial reform programme. I'll be tracking all the reaction to Moody's downgrade this morning, as well the Eurogroup meeting in Brussels and other key events across the world economy.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The MP and anti-payday loans campaigner Stella Creasy has demanded an apology from the online lender Wonga after a Guardian investigation uncovered evidence that an employee of the firm has been using an anonymous Twitter account to publicly attack her, calling her mentally unstable. Wonga's slogan and adverts promise \"straight talking money\", but company computers appear to have been used to post anonymous comments on blogs critical of its practices and there is evidence that a second Wonga employee has deleted criticism from its Wikipedia page. A computer in the Wonga offices appears to have been used to remove from the company's Wikipedia page a reference to controversy over its sponsorship of Newcastle United Football Club and to delete the category of \"usury\" under the See Also section. Wonga admitted on Tuesday a \"junior employee\" might have made unauthorised comments online and would face disciplinary action if found to have been responsible for the abusive tweets. It defended its right to correct \"inaccurate\" entries on Wikipedia. Wonga has faced mounting criticism for targeting low-income customers with short-terms loans charging an annualised interest rate of 4,214%, but the evidence seen by the Guardian suggests at least one employee has been fighting back by using so-called \"sock puppet\" accounts to attack critics and post favourable comments underneath articles about the firm. One Twitter account, traced to someone operating within Wonga's London office, called Creasy \"mental\", \"nuts\", and a \"self-serving egomaniac\" because of her campaigning against the controversial firm and the wider payday loans market. Creasy said: \"Wonga have been less than positive about the arguments I've made about cost-capping [of short-term loans] and have been the most virulent and aggressive about defending the industry as a whole. They will obviously stoop to many levels and this is just one of them. I would expect an apology.\" The Twitter account was operated in the name of @DanielSargant1, but it was closed shortly after the Guardian questioned Wonga about its provenance. Someone using the same unusual spelling of this name also left a comment defending Wonga \u2013 calling the firm \"a rare British tech success story\" \u2013 on an article critical of Wonga on a blog called the Silicon Roundabout Reboot. His comment came from the same internet protocol (IP) address as that used by Luke Manning, editor of OpenWonga (a Wonga-owned website that aims to educate consumers about the brand), when he also made a comment on the blog. An IP address is a unique set of numbers, much like a telephone number, that computers use to communicate with one another. Computers that share a router to connect to the internet will appear to have the same IP address. Manning confirmed that he had left the comment attributed to OpenWonga using Wonga's computer system, but said he did not know who had left the comment attributed to Daniel Sargant. A Wonga employee has used the same IP address to edit its Wikipedia page over the last three months, the latest amendment being made at the end of October. \"Conflict of interest editing\" is a controversial practice that is \"very strongly discouraged\" by Wikipedia. The website allows anyone to edit its content, but the site maintains a neutral point of view policy. Its rules say adding material that appears to advance the interests or promote the visibility of an article's author, the author's family, employer, clients, associates or business, places the author in a conflict of interest. A Wonga spokesman said: \"We can confirm one of our junior employees may have made unauthorised comments on a blog, and elsewhere on the web, while not identifying themselves correctly. This is an issue that Wonga takes extremely seriously, as we are committed to openness and transparency. We are now carrying out a full investigation and, if the employee is found to be responsible, they will face serious disciplinary action.\" Insiders claim Manning is not the employee Wonga suspects as the source of the Twitter abuse and that he only made minor changes to the Wikipedia entry. Someone using the Wonga.com IP address began editing the Wiki page in August, when it removed substantial portions from the criticism section. A note justifying one edit stated: \"Added other side of the debate in question, for balance.\" The latest edit carried out on 29 October 2012 removed reference to a blog entry on the Harvard Business Review website that described Wonga as \"the worst business model in the world\". Someone using the Wonga IP address also changed the name of the product from \"Payday loan and short-term high-interest credit\" to \"Short-term credit\". However, Wonga is not alone in trying to improve its image on Wikipedia: the Central Intelligence Agency, the Vatican and Sony have all been exposed on Wikipedia for editing their own pages or employing others such as public relations agencies to carry out edits on their behalf. The Wonga spokesman said: \"Like many organisations, Wonga regularly reviews its Wikipedia entry to ensure it is both accurate and comprehensive. In doing so we adhere to a strict policy. We will add material that is both factually correct and we believe of interest to readers, plus we will occasionally seek to remove inaccurate material. We would not attempt to remove accurate material, even if negative, in keeping with the guiding principles of Wikipedia.\" The Wonga spokesman said: \"We are still carrying out our investigation, which will look all concerns raised but, to be clear, we do not condone any form of misleading or aggressive behaviour, on or offline.\" The Wonga revelations come on the same day that the regulator, the Office of Fair Trading, wrote to all 240 payday lenders highlighting \"emerging concerns\" over poor practices in the market, including \"aggressive\" debt collection practices.",

    "webTitle": "Bernanke: fiscal cliff failure would send US economy back into recession", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has warned that the fiscal cliff poses a \"substantial threat\" to the US recovery. In his first speech since president Barack Obama's re-election, Bernanke said that the year-end expiration of Bush-era tax cuts and imposition of deep spending cuts would send the US \"toppling back into recession.\" Speaking at the New York Economic Club, Bernanke called the US recovery \"disappointingly slow\". He added: \"Indeed, since the recession trough in mid-2009, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) has averaged only a little more than 2% per year.\" He acknowledged some positive indicators: the job market continues to improve, inflation remains low and the housing market appears to be improving. But Bernanke said the Federal Reserve remained concerned about the fragility of the recovery, not least because of threats from abroad. \"The elevated levels of stress in European economies and uncertainty about how the problems there will be resolved are adding to the risks that US financial institutions, businesses, and households must consider when making lending and investment decisions,\" Bernanke said. He also said the row over the fiscal cliff presented a major challenge to the US economy. \"The realization of all of the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that make up the fiscal cliff, absent offsetting changes, would pose a substantial threat to the recovery \u2013 indeed, by the reckoning of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and that of many outside observers, a fiscal shock of that size would send the economy toppling back into recession.\" In his speech, Bernanke warned that a row over increasing the US debt ceiling in Washington would have dire consequences. A row over raising the debt limit in the summer of 2011 led to a historic downgrade of US debt by ratings agencies and triggered panic on financial markets around the world. \"A failure to reach a timely agreement this time around could impose even heavier economic and financial costs,\" said Bernanke. David Semmens, senior US economist at Standard Chartered, said the speech signaled the Fed was unlikely to raise interest rates any time soon. \"This is certainly a speech that is signally the risks remain firmly to the downside. We are likely to see the Fed on hold for longer rather than shorter and that they will only be hiking when they are assured of a self-sustaining recovery,\" he said.",

The voting system was highly complex but a rough summary is this: Qatar Holding, by saying last week that it would abstain on the \u00a3140m retention packages, ensured that the only way the Glencore deal could happen was if 75% of shareholders voted for the merger-cum-takeover without the awards. Swing voters knew what they had to do to get a thumbs-up for the transaction itself. Even then, the key resolution passed only by a whisker \u2013 79% were in favour. Should Xstrata chairman Sir John Bond take comfort in that? Of course not. It is humiliating for a company chairman to see his strong recommendation to shareholders ignored. His credibility as would-be chairman of Glenstrata was completely undermined and his resignation from that role was inevitable. Bond mishandled this saga in many ways. First, he infuriated non-Glencore shareholders by proposing a retention package with no performance criteria. That looked like a reward for Xstrata's top executives simply for turning up for work. Second, even after he was bludgeoned into attaching performance conditions, he failed to explain in detail who was getting what and why. The full list of the proposed 70 recipients was never published, making it impossible for outsiders to judge Xstrata's definition of an essential employee. The board's intransigence on that point was plain arrogant. Third, he designed a revised voting formula that was so complex it almost delivered no deal at all. Some of us would say that would have been no bad thing. But it's clear that a majority of shareholders wanted to accept Glencore's improved terms. Mixed messages on the retention package from 12% shareholder Qatar did not make Bond's life easy. But the fault ultimately lay in the lack of leadership on Xstrata's board. The result is a serious governance mess that will have to be addressed quickly by the new chairman of Glenstrata.",

Even then, the key resolution passed only by a whisker \u2013 79% were in favour.</p> <p>Should Xstrata chairman Sir John Bond take comfort in that? Of course not. It is humiliating for a company chairman to see his strong recommendation to shareholders ignored. His credibility as would-be chairman of Glenstrata was completely undermined and his resignation from that role was inevitable.</p> <p>Bond mishandled this saga in many ways. First, he infuriated non-Glencore shareholders by proposing a retention package with no performance criteria. That looked like a reward for Xstrata's top executives simply for turning up for work.</p> <p>Second, even after he was bludgeoned into attaching performance conditions, he failed to explain in detail who was getting what and why. The full list of the proposed 70 recipients was never published, making it impossible for outsiders to judge Xstrata's definition of an essential employee. The board's intransigence on that point was plain arrogant.</p> <p>Third, he designed a revised voting formula that was so complex it almost delivered no deal at all. Some of us would say that would have been no bad thing. But it's clear that a majority of shareholders wanted to accept Glencore's improved terms.</p> <p>Mixed messages on the retention package from 12% shareholder Qatar did not make Bond's life easy. But the fault ultimately lay in the lack of leadership on Xstrata's board. The result is a serious governance mess that will have to be addressed quickly by the new chairman of Glenstrata.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The owner of Hovis is to cut 900 jobs and close two bakeries as part of plans to overhaul its struggling bread business. Premier Foods, which is labouring under \u00a31bn of debt, announced the move on Tuesdayafter a review following the loss of its \u00a375m-a-year contract with Co-operative supermarkets in October. The biggest impact will be felt in Birmingham, where 511 jobs are to be lost with the closure of a factory and a distribution operation, scheduled to take place next year. Hovis operations at Greenford, west London, will also shut with the loss of 196 jobs, and Premier Foods is preparing to close distribution sites at Plymouth and Mendlesham, Suffolk, resulting in the loss of 95 jobs in total. Unite, Britain's biggest union, has called for urgent talks with Premier Foods' management about the job losses. The bread division employs nearly half of Premier's 10,000-strong workforce and has 13 bakeries, accounting for nearly 40% of the St Albans-based group's revenue. Premier, which also makes Mr Kipling cakes and Bisto gravy, has been struggling for years with tough competition in the bread market and the significant logistics costs of daily deliveries. It has also been hit by rising wheat prices after droughts in the main export countries of the US and Russia. Investors welcomed the decision to shrink the bread business at Britain's biggest food producer. Shares in Premier Foods jumped around 3%. \"For the employees it is very sad but from an investor's standpoint it is a decisive and welcome move\", said Martin Deboo at Investec. He said the cuts should be sufficient for now, but suggested it could lead to an eventual, profitable exit from the bread business. In the long term this will improve profitability, adds Deboo. The biggest competitors to Hovis are Warburtons and Kingsmill, owned by Associated British Foods. Margins are traditionally weak and supermarkets are very price sensitive, especially in times when customers double-check every penny they spend. Michael Clarke, Premier's chief executive, who joined the group last year from Kraft, said: \"Decisions will not be taken lightly but they are necessary if we are to build a strong and successful future for the bread division and those who remain with our business.\" Clarke is focusing the business on eight \"power brands\" including Hovis, Oxo, Batchelor's, Bisto, Ambrosia and Mr Kipling. Premier Foods had overstretched itself in a decade-long spree of acquisitions, most notably in 2007 with the \u00a31.2bn purchase of RHM, formerly Rank Hovis McDougall \u2013 owner of Hovis. Recently the company had to agree to a sales target with banks as part of a refinancing of its debt burden, which had come down to less than \u00a31bn after the sale of Branston Pickle to Japanese Mizkan Group and the sale of Hartley's jams and Sun-Pat peanut butter to US company Hain Celestial. The job cuts at Premier Foods are another blow for British food industry. On Monday, the Dutch firm behind haggis maker Hall's of Broxburn has put up its UK businesses for sale. Vion UK has its head office in Livingston and employs 13,000 people at 38 sites in the UK. The company said it is confident it will sell its UK pork, red meat and poultry business units. Last month, Vion had announced it will close it Hall's of Broxburn meat processing plant in West Lothian with the loss of 1,700 jobs.",

      "bodyText": "Hewlett-Packard has revealed that it has taken an $8.8bn (\u00a35.5bn) charge after \"serious accounting improprieties\" were discovered at Autonomy, the British tech firm it acquired in 2011 for more than $10bn. The Silicon Valley giant called on the US and British authorities to investigate what it called \"serious accounting improprieties, disclosure failures and outright misrepresentations at Autonomy\" that occurred prior to HP's acquisition. The deal was brokered under HP's previous chief executive Leo Apotheker but finalised by current boss Meg Whitman, the former eBay chief and one-time California gubernatorial candidate.

But the deal soon soured as angry investors accused the company of over-paying, anger that contributed to the ousting of Apotheker after just 10 months in the job. Lynch left in May as HP announced 27,000 job cuts world-wide as part of a $3bn-$3.5bn cost-cutting programme. Lynch had been close to Apotheker. He initially appeared to have Whitman's full support but blamed a lack of independence at the company for his departure. The company in turn pointed to a \"significant\" decline in Autonomy's core licensing revenues and said the division needed new leadership. The Autonomy investigation is believed to have been started by a whistleblower in Autonomy's leadership who came forward after Lynch's departure. The executive alleged there had been a \"series of questionable accounting and business practices\" prior to the acquisition, HP said. The whistleblower gave \"numerous details\" of alleged accounting irregularities about which the company said it had no prior knowledge. HP called in PricewaterhouseCoopers to do a forensic review of Autonomy's historical financial results. The investigation determined that Autonomy was \"substantially overvalued at the time of its acquisition\" due to misstatements of financial performance, including revenue, core growth rate and gross margins. According to HP Autonomy mischaracterised revenue from loss-making low-end hardware sales that represented as much as 15% of the company's revenue. HP said Autonomy also presented licensing transactions where no end-customer existed at the time of sale as revenue. \"This appears to have been a willful effort on behalf of certain former Autonomy employees to inflate the underlying financial metrics of the company in order to mislead investors and potential buyers,\" HP said in a statement. \"These misrepresentations and lack of disclosure severely impacted HP management's ability to fairly value Autonomy at the time of the deal.\" The company said it had alerted the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) enforcement division in the US and the UK's Serious Fraud Office.

Customer numbers in the US grew by 20% and in Spain by 42%. Chief executive Richard Harpin said: </p> <blockquote> Homeserve is making progress in transitioning its UK business to a smaller, more customer focused operation and has delivered good growth in its international businesses in the first half of the year. <br> In the UK we are currently testing a number of new marketing and product propositions, the effectiveness of which will determine the future shape and size of our UK business. </blockquote> <p>Homeserve said its full year results would be in line with expectations, but admitted the FSA investigation was still going on. Its shares have jumped 4.4p to 227.4p, and David Brockton at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> Homeserve's first half the results as positive in the context of recent uncertainty, but the group is still subject to an FSA </blockquote> <p>review and the effectiveness of its UK marketing remains untested and this will continue to limit performance.</p> <p>Andy Brown at Panmure Gordon remained cautious, with a 145p target price:</p> <blockquote> The share price has had a spike up mid-year due to speculation around private equity interest. It retains a decent dividend yield which provides some support to the share price although for us to go positive we would want better yield support. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere leading shares have slipped back after Monday's surge, in the wake of Moody's cutting its Triple A rating on France and ahead of the EU finance ministers' meeting to determine Greece's fate. The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is currently 22.10 points lower at 5715.56.</p> <p><strong>InterContinental Hotels</strong> is the biggest riser in the leading index, up 36p at \u00a316.26 after Barclays moved its recommendation from equal weight to overweight and its price target from \u00a317.30 to \u00a318.25.

      "bodyText": "Homeserve, the repair and insurance group being investigated by the financial services authority, is on track to shrink its UK business in favour of overseas expansion. The company, which sells cover and repairs boilers and pipes, is being probed by the regulator for how it sold some of its policies, and said it would cut its UK operations in favour of growing in the US and Spain. As it announced an 8% rise in half year revenues and a 5% increase in profits to \u00a319.1m, it said UK customer numbers had fallen from 3m a year ago to 2.5m. Customer numbers in the US grew by 20% and in Spain by 42%. Chief executive Richard Harpin said: Homeserve is making progress in transitioning its UK business to a smaller, more customer focused operation and has delivered good growth in its international businesses in the first half of the year. In the UK we are currently testing a number of new marketing and product propositions, the effectiveness of which will determine the future shape and size of our UK business. Homeserve said its full year results would be in line with expectations, but admitted the FSA investigation was still going on. Its shares have jumped 4.4p to 227.4p, and David Brockton at Espirito Santo said: Homeserve's first half the results as positive in the context of recent uncertainty, but the group is still subject to an FSA review and the effectiveness of its UK marketing remains untested and this will continue to limit performance. Andy Brown at Panmure Gordon remained cautious, with a 145p target price: The share price has had a spike up mid-year due to speculation around private equity interest. It retains a decent dividend yield which provides some support to the share price although for us to go positive we would want better yield support. Elsewhere leading shares have slipped back after Monday's surge, in the wake of Moody's cutting its Triple A rating on France and ahead of the EU finance ministers' meeting to determine Greece's fate. The FTSE 100 is currently 22.10 points lower at 5715.56. InterContinental Hotels is the biggest riser in the leading index, up 36p at \u00a316.26 after Barclays moved its recommendation from equal weight to overweight and its price target from \u00a317.30 to \u00a318.25.
