      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca has a strong defence: use it Is Pascal Soriot a one-in-a-hundred chief executive who dares to say \"no\" even if fund managers are screaming at him to say \"yes\"? Believe it when you hear it, of course, but the chief executive of AstraZeneca was quietly impressive this week. As the City licked its lips in anticipation of Pfizer's (inevitable) higher bid, Soriot made a couple of strong points. First, he emphasised the long-term nature of drug development and pointed to Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) as an example of a big pharma company that has improved its share price hugely via clever deals and partnerships and a concentration on fewer therapeutic areas. Even after a dip this week, BMS's shares have roughly doubled in four years under chief executive Lamberto Andreotti. Soriot is following a similar strategy at AstraZeneca and the suggestion is that shareholders could also be rewarded if only they are prepared to show a little patience \u2013 but, crucially, not everlasting patience. BMS's revenues, like AstraZeneca's, are still roughly flat, but the excitement is generated by the progress in trials of potential cancer drugs. Could AstraZeneca, where the oncology portfolio is also the big swing factor in assessing value, be BMS with a lag of a year or two? It's a plausible line of argument. It also seems to be accepted by some analysts; Citi this week said AstraZencea's \"intrinsic value\" is \u00a349 a share, which is a pound higher than Pfizer's current offer. Soriot's second point was that a director's duties go beyond consideration of the headline price of a takeover offer, especially in a deal partly backed by shares. He is clearly wary of Pfizer's strategy of splitting operations into three divisions: \"The model where you would split the company in three pieces I don't think would work at all for our business.\" Nor does he regard Pfizer's plan to flip its tax domicile to the UK as 100% solid, which is relevant because a deal could take 10 months to complete, and the US political climate on tax \"inversions\" could turn openly hostile. Soriot's comments could equally be interpreted as the standard dance of defiance that all chief executives are obliged to perform when an unsolicited bidder is at door. We have seen capitulation follow many times when the bidding hots up. But AstraZeneca's non-executive directors, with less risk to their careers, should take these arguments seriously and be prepared to dig in their heels if they see fit. John Varley, former Barclays chief executive, doesn't seem the type to defy the City consensus. And chairman Leif Johansson has been alarmingly invisible so far. But how about Marcus Wallenberg, leading light in the prominent Swedish family? Or our own Baroness Vadera, former enforcer in Gordon Brown's administration? These non-executives should remember that their job is to form their own opinions and consider what's good for the company, which may not be same as what bonus-seeking fund managers regard as beneficial. If the non-execs want advice, they should read the stirring letter to the FT this week from Sir Simon Robertson, lauded investment banker. \"In considering value, directors should be prepared, and it is particularly pertinent in the AstraZeneca case, to take a long-term view, ie seven-to-10 years, of the prospects of the business,\" wrote Robertson. What's more, they should give a honest view of what's best for AstraZeneca \"financially and socially.\" Quite right. If AstraZeneca's directors really believe in the strength of the company's drug pipeline, and if they truly think Pfizer would be a poor steward of the assets, it is hard to understand why they would recommend a bid within the rumoured \u00a355-\u00a360 range. Labour play an interesting card Still on the bid battle, Labour's Chuka Umunna played an interesting card on Friday when he said an incoming Labour administration would look at applying a public interest test to a Pfizer/AstraZeneca deal. It sounded like a harder pledge than he or leader Ed Miliband has given so far. Wouldn't a takeover, if agreed, be done and dusted before next May's general election? Not necessarily. The European Commission has to take a look, and the Chinese competition authorities, who tend to move at snail's pace, will also investigate because Pfizer and AstraZeneca are the two of the biggest foreign pharmaceutical firms in China. The best guess in the City is that completion would take about 10 months \u2013 but that's from the point at which an agreement was reached. Next May could conceivably be relevant. Dixons Carphone: tied at the hip? How nice. The senior executives of Dixons Carphone were so keen to promote the idea that theirs really is a \"merger of equals\" that they co-ordinated their sartorial look in new photographs. Neckwear, we must assume, was discarded in a symbolic \"bonfire of the ties.\" Will the harmony last? The odds are against because the boardroom seems to have been arranged on the principle that \"all must have jobs.\" The new company will start life with an executive chairman, a brace of co-deputy chairmen, a chief executive, a deputy chief executive, and chief executives of both Dixons and Carphone. Who is first among equals? It is surely chairman Sir Charles Dunstone since he is the biggest beast in the big boardroom and, as 12% shareholder in the new company, has most riding on its success. Dunstone didn't build Carphone with so many chiefs. Sooner or later, one suspects, a head or two will have to roll in the interests of clean decision-making. That photo parade seemed like trying a little too hard. The Co-operative Group has its day The Co-operative Group's day of decision is on Saturday and committee members should, by now, know where their duty lies. They should back the governance reforms. It is the right thing to do and the Co-op risks meltdown without fundamental change. Then the Co-op must implement the reforms without delay. Foot-dragging by the regional committees after a \"yes\" vote would also be highly dangerous. This is how perks become permanent As new chief executive of Burberry, Christopher Bailey is obliged to look the part of fashion princeling. But does it cost \u00a31,235-a-day to maintain appearances when you get an 80% staff discount on the in-house clobber? As it happens, Bailey's \u00a3440,000-a-year \"allowance\" is not specifically allocated to clothes. What does it cover? Burberry won't say. The sum is just labelled an \"allowance\" within a package where other elements include a \u00a31.1m salary, a potential \u00a32.2m bonus and a performance-related \u00a37.6m \"golden hello\". The explanation seems to be that predecessor Angela Ahrendts had an allowance so Burberry thinks Bailey should too. But Ahrendts was recruited from abroad and the company listed what her \u00a3387,000-a-year covered: \"accommodation, travel and school fees etc for a period of no longer than five years\". This is how boardroom pay works. Last year's exceptional arrangement becomes permanent, and the sums always inflate.",

      "bodyText": "The energy group E.ON has been ordered to pay \u00a312m to its customers after an investigation into mis-selling found \"extensive poor practices\". It is the largest-ever penalty levied by the energy regulator, Ofgem. More than 333,000 customers who receive the Warm Home Discount Scheme, which is targeted at older people and those on low incomes, will automatically receive a payment of about \u00a335. E.ON said the payments would be made \"within a matter of weeks\". But the final bill for E.ON could be up to \u00a320m. The energy company is expected to pay between \u00a33m and \u00a38m in compensation to 465,000 customers who were mis-sold energy between June 2010 and December 2013. These customers are in line for an average payment of \u00a367. The \u00a312m penalty reflects \"E.ON's extensive poor sales practices,\" Ofgem said. The regulator said it found no evidence that E.ON's senior managers had deliberately mis-sold energy to customers, but they had failed to ensure sales staff were properly trained and followed the rules. As a result, customers were given incorrect information on the doorstep or over the phone and were not made aware of key terms of the contract before it was signed. E.ON's chief executive, Tony Cocker, said the failings were \"completely unacceptable. We are really sorry and want to make it absolutely clear that we're putting this right.\" He said the company had ended doorstep selling and cold-calling in their homes in a complete overhaul of sales operations. Sarah Harrison, Ofgem's senior partner in charge of enforcement, said: \"The time is right to draw a line under past supplier bad behaviour and truly rebuild trust so consumers are put at the heart of the energy market. E.ON has today taken a good step by accepting responsibility for its actions and putting proper redress in place.\" Ed Davey, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, said: \"It's right that if energy companies aren't fair to their customers, then they're penalised \u2013 and their customers benefit. That's why we introduced legislation to ensure Ofgem can take tough action in these cases, including making the company pay compensation to the people affected.\" Since 2010 Ofgem has imposed nearly \u00a3100m in fines and redress on energy companies for breaking the rules, including \u00a339m for mis-selling. The largest-ever penalty for mis-selling until this ruling was a \u00a310.5m fine for SSE in May 2013. On that occasion, the company's telesales agents were found to have used \"misleading scripts\" while failing to give accurate estimates and comparisons to customers. Npower was ordered to pay \u00a33.5m last December for mis-selling, while Scottish Power was fined \u00a38.5m in October for misleading its customers. The latest fine was seized on by Labour as further evidence of Britain's \"broken\" energy market. \"E.ON is just the latest in a long line of energy companies to be found guilty of misleading the public,\" said the shadow energy and climate change minister, Jonathan Reynolds. \"The energy giants must know that if they mistreat customers already facing a cost-of-living crisis there will be a very heavy price to pay.\" The party has promised to freeze energy bills until 2017 and break up the big six energy companies, if it gets into power. E.ON customers who think they have been mis-sold can call 0800 0568 497 for more information.",

      "bodyText": "A former boss of the Co-operative Group called on Friday for reforms drawn up by Lord Myners to be revised, as members of the UK's largest mutual prepared to vote on overhauling the way the 150-year-old business is run. Sir Graham Melmoth, who led the Co-op between 1996 and 2002, told a conference in Manchester it would be wrong to accept the reforms put forward by the former City minister without question. Instead, a series of public meetings should be held around the UK and a final draft approved by the board and members \"in the shortest possible time\". \"I see that as the Co-operative way, rather than 'take it or leave it' \u2013 with the possible consequences of deciding by default to leave it,\" he said. Melmoth was speaking on the eve of the group's annual general meeting where a resolution on reforming the business, which lost \u00a32.5bn in 2013, will be voted on by about 100 individuals. Myners has claimed that if the reforms are not implemented, the banks owed \u00a31.4bn by the Co-op will take tighter control of the supermarket, pharmacies and funeral homes chain. \"I think the motion will go through tomorrow, but I hope that between that vote and a period of reflection there might be some adjustment here and there,\" Melmoth said. He said Myners had \"ratcheted up the tension\" in recent days in an attempt to put pressure on the board \u2013 \"all designed to get the leader writers to declare in unison that members should vote for his governance reforms as they stand\". The board had been \"[found] wanting so it has to change\". Some have suggested Melmoth could play a role in seeing through the reforms. \"If there's a bit of fence-mending to be done I would like to make a contribution, but I'm 76 now and my life has moved on,\" Melmoth said, adding he did not think he would make a long-term commitment. He said the Myners report was \"a substantial and professional piece of work\" but there were flaws. Myners's proposals envisage a newly-constituted board with an independent chair, a nominations committee to vet board applicants and a national members council to represent the views of members. But Melmoth raised doubts over the proposals in his speech at the Ways Forward 2 conference, viewed as an alternative Co-op annual meeting, in Manchester's Central Hall. He asked: \"Where is the link in the new structure between board and membership?\" Melmoth referred briefly to the scandal that engulfed the Co-op bank over its former chairman, Paul Flowers, saying the behaviour of \"a Methodist minister from Bradford\" had added to its ills had \"confect[ed] a shameful tale\". Only a handful of delegates at the conference will be entitled to attend Saturday's meeting at the group's Manchester headquarters. Patrick Gray, president of Midcounties, the second-largest co-operative in the UK, reflected the general mood among delegates at the Ways Forward 2 conference by offering tentative support for the Myners plan. The attendees at the AGM include representatives from the independent societies such as Midcounties, which together own 22% of the Group, and members of the seven regional boards, which represent eight million Co-op members who own 78% of the Group. But he was concerned that Myners barely mentioned senior management. \"The obvious explanation of the disastrous events of the last decade is not that lay members of the board were too powerful, but that the merger between United and CWS in 2004 left an ambitious chief executive virtually unchecked,\" said Gray. \"In these circumstances it seems paradoxical that the changes Lord Myners proposes would greatly strengthen the position of the chief executive by giving him or her, and the chief financial officer, voting rights on a small board made up entirely of individuals from a similar background.\" He also expressed concern that the effect of the proposed reforms would be to replace one highly engineered system with another. He said Myners believed that the only way to save the group was to hand over power \"to the sort of people that sit on the boards of the country's largest private retail companies\". Gray believed that despite its shortcomings, the Myners plan was likely to be voted in and become \"the catalyst\" for a resurgence in the Co-operative movement. \"We'll get over the damage done by the Flowers scandal. What the movement has to do now is rise to the challenge that Myners has set,\" Gray said.",

Over the past 5 days, Spain\u2019s IBEX has dropped 1.4% while Portugal\u2019s PSI is down 4.8%.</p> </blockquote> <p>Established parties in many countries are heading for a shoeing at the ballot box this month, given the depth of public anger over the events of recent years. That will fan fears that political instability could reignite the crisis, at a time when sustained economic growth is elusive.<br></p> <p>Foley explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although the periphery has come a long way from the darkest darks of the economic crisis, opinion polls linked to this month\u2019s European elections serve as a reminder that economic struggles are still playing out. Specifically, discontent over high levels of unemployment and changes to living standards remain at extremely high levels and both European institutions and domestic political are being blamed. A recent national Greek opinion poll suggest that the PM\u2019s coalition partner Pasok has only 5.5% of a vote, with this party taking a lot of the blame for the crisis. If a general election were to be called now, this coalition would probably not survive. This suggests a rocky political landscape is still a potential threat in Greece. In Portugal too, opinion polls suggest that support for the ruling coalition has plunged and that anger stemming from the impact of the crisis is still extremely raw. In Spain too domestic political parties are also reportedly taking a lot of the blame for the continue impact of the crisis.</p> <p>The nature of democracy means that politicians seek to be popular. The implication is that momentum towards structural reform in Europe could be lost as general elections near. This is turn could dull the attraction of peripheral assets. The crisis may yet come back to bite us.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5375d3cbe4b0750615b05234\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-16T09:02:19.005Z\">10.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>No Sunday morning lie-in for me....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland/statuses/467224022519132160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Mark Carney, Governor of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland\">@BankofEngland</a> speaks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DermotMurnaghan\">@DermotMurnaghan</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews\">@SkyNews</a> from 10am this Sunday. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Murnaghan&amp;src=hash\">#Murnaghan</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/G1Fq9oKF7v\">pic.twitter.com/G1Fq9oKF7v</a></p>&mdash; Bank of England (@bankofengland) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland/statuses/467224022519132160\">May 16, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5375cd19e4b0e9ce777ba1a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-16T08:39:59.555Z\">9.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4139fa41-1107-44f1-9cd8-cd9735a7b185\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/16/1400229367253/38ea1c75-15df-4bc7-b9a7-c1c75c0eeaf5-460x184.png\" alt=\"European stock markets, May 16, morning\" width=\"460\" height=\"184\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><b>There's an edgy mood in Europe's financial markets today, with the main indices little changed after yesterday afternoon's selloff.</b></p> <p>Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities reckons that traders are experiencing \"a bout of vertigo\" after the recent rallies.</p> <p>The news yesterday that the eurozone only grew by 0.2% last quarter continues to weigh on shares too. </p> <p> Ian Williams of Peel Hunt says the data:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"underline the continued fragility of domestic demand, especially in nations where Government policy seems to be hindering progress\".</p> </blockquote> <p>As witnessed in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/16/weak-european-car-sales-markets-eon-fine-live?view=desktop#block-5375af99e4b0e9ce777ba18e\">this morning's car sales figures</a>....</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5375c2cfe4b0e9ce777ba19a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-16T08:01:41.230Z\">9.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/16/weak-european-car-sales-markets-eon-fine-live?view=desktop#block-5375bfbde4b039063b103378\">E.ON's \u00a312m fine for mis-selling energy products</a></b> to hundreds of thousands of customers is the latest proof that the market is broken, claims the opposition Labour party which promises to overhaul the industry.</p> <p><b>Jonathan Reynolds MP, Shadow Energy and Climate Change Minister,</b> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>E.ON is just the latest in a long line of energy companies to be found guilty of misleading the public.

      "bodyText": "A week when the UK's leading share index hit its best level for 14 years failed to end on a high, writes Nick Fletcher. Worries about the Portuguese economy, despite its expected exit from its bailout programme this weekend, unsettled investors, while Thursday's weaker than expected eurozone growth figures continued to have an influence. So by the close of play: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 14.92 points or 0.22% higher at 6855.81 \u2022 Germany's Dax dropped 0.28% to 9629.10 \u2022 France's Cac closed up 0.26% at 4456.28 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB jumped 1.12% to 20,648.59 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 1.1% better at 10,478.7 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 5.6% points or 0.04%. On that note it's time to close for the evening and indeed the week. Thanks for your comments, and we'll be back next week. Hold that Pfizer excitement. Not a raised bid for AstraZeneca but a new drug application for breast cancer treatment palbociclib. Pfizer shares are back trading again. Back to those fired cleaners in Greece who today saw their eight month struggle to be rehired end in victory following a Greek court\u2019s landmark decision to have the reinstated. But while the victory is sweet the dismissed workers fear more anguish lies ahead if the Greek government decides to appeal the ruling. Helena Smith reports: Seated around the long trestle table they erected ten days ago outside the offices of the ministry of finance on Karageorgis Servias, which runs of central Syntagma square, the cleaners were today in joyful mood. The ruling, after eight months of persistent protests, is the vindication the nearly 500 laid off employees have long been waiting for. \u201cFor us it is the biggest victory that could have happened,\u201d says Despoina Kostopoulou, aged 53, who has been employed as a cleaner at the finance ministry for nearly 20 years. \u201cIt has finally shown that our struggle has been effective.\u201d But the women are also worried as to what the future will bring. In an ideal world they would be re-instated and re-hired next week following the court verdict. \u201cEverything now depends on how the ministry reacts, \u201c said Kostopoulou. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to really enjoy our victory until we know that the government is not gong to appeal the decision and our lawyer says that is far from sure. If it doesn\u2019t we will return to work on Monday and Tuesday. But if it does this could go on for many months yet,\u201d continued the cleaner who has spent the past ten nights sleeping in a tent pitched outside the ministry Unexpectedly organised, and often protesting with military precision, the cleaners have become the symbol of the corrosive effects of ruthless cost cutting during Greece\u2019s debt crisis. \u201cHow much has the government really saved by firing us,\u201d asked Kostopoulou. \u201cWe have been pushed to the brink of despair. Many of us are mothers with no qualifications or ability to be rehired elsewhere. The drama we have lived has been so unnecessary and so unfair.\u201d Breaking news: Pfizer shares halted pending news. General Motors is paying a $35m fine over the faulty ignition switch has been linked to at last 13 deaths, the Department of Transport has just announced. CEO Mary Barra was grilled on Capitol Hill over the switch problems in April, which also led to 2.6 million cars being recalled. Further hearings are expected. And as Dominic Rushe explains here, the $35m fine is not the end of the issue: General Motors struck a deal with the US Department of Transportation on Friday over its massive recall of cars with faulty ignition switches. The news, first reported by CNBC, comes amid a Justice Department investigation into GM\u2019s failure to address deadly safety problems in a timely manner. Over in Athens, Helena Smith reports that the finance ministry cleaning staff are together, as usual, to digest the courtroom victory which means hundreds should get their jobs back (as covered at 11.19am) Here's a video clip of Tony Cocker, chief executive of E.ON, saying he is \"personally devastated\" about the company's mis-selling scandal, which earned a \u00a312m fine from Ofgem today. Consumer confidence in the US has taken a knock. The University of Michigan's monthly survey dropping to 81.8, from 84.1 in March. That's weaker than expected, with analysts forecasting a small rise to 85.0. It continues the topsy-turvey theme of US data recently -- just a little while after the encouraging jump in housing starts. Over in Italy, Matteo Renzi's cabinet have agreed to sell 40% the country's postal service; part of its plan to raise \u20ac12bn through asset sales. The government said the sale of a stake in Poste Italiane \"can be carried out in several stages and through a public offering,\". It could raise around \u20ac4bn. AFP adds: The cabinet meeting also approved the sale of Enav, the state air traffic control agency, which could bring around 1.0 billion euros into state coffers. The government is also planning to list up to 49 percent of state-owned shipbuilder Fincantieri in the biggest privatisations in two decades as part of an effort to reduce Italy's towering debt mountain.

Alastair McCaig of IG comments: Yesterday\u2019s Dow sell-off caused frazzled nerves and takes the shine off the \u2018fresh all time highs\u2019 narrative that predominated earlier this week. The lack of volume on up days and the avalanche of selling on down days should be a major warning sign for investors. The continued volatility will mean that those sitting on the sidelines waiting for an entry will stay out even longer, perhaps waiting for a retest of the April lows. Germany's DAX has dipped 0.3% in Frankfurt, and the French CAC is flat. America's house-building sector roared back to life after a few quiet months, with the number of housing starts jumping 13.2% in April. Housing starts (which count when a builder begins constructing a new site) rose to an annual pace of 1.07 million, the highest level since November 2013. And permits to build a new homes jumped 8%, to an annual rate of 1.08 million, suggesting housebuilding will be strong for the coming months. The number of multi-family properties (apartment blocks, or condominiums) surged by almost 40%, while new single-family homes rose just 0.8%. Paul Hewitt, business development manager at corporate governance firm Manifest, has confirmed that Kentz is the first UK company to see its boardroom pay policies rejected this year. He explains: \u201cUntil today we were talking about Hiscox being the biggest so far so Kentz is the first to be defeated this year\u201d. A significant victory for shareholder power, then. Yesterday, Hiscox suffered a 42% rebellion over its pay plans. (via Jill Treanor) Kentz isn't the first UK-listed company to face the wrath of its investors in recent week, but I think it's the first one to actually have its pay policy voted down (making it the first undeniably successful revolt of the year) This morning, a quarter of shareholders in Chime refused to back its pay policies (led by Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP). Yesterday, there were revolts at oil companies BG Group and Petrofac. And on Wednesday, ITV survived a protest over CEO Adam Crozier's pay packet. Engineering and construction firm Kentz Corporation has just been rocked by the first successful revolt over boardroom pay of the year. Investors in Kentz have refused to approve the engineering and construction company's remuneration policies, forcing it to revise the plans. Over 37 million shares were cast against the (binding) vote on Kentz' remuneration policies, with 35 million in favour. A further 10 million shares were withheld (the traditional way of expressing concern without actually voting against the board). In a statement, Kentz said it \"notes the position of our shareholders\", and will speak to them to adjust its pay plans Once this consultation has concluded, we will put the revised Remuneration Policy forward for another vote in due course. This is the first time that Kentz has allowed its shareholders to vote on pay - previously it used its status as a Jersey-based company as a loophole to avoid it. According to the FT, Kentz CEO's basic pay packet has risen by 60% since 2011, to $780,000. Is the Shareholder Spring over excessive pay turning into a Summer of protests? Portugal's prime minister has denied that the country will ease up on its austerity measures once it exits its bailout, this weekend. Appearing on CNBC today, Pedro Passos Coelho acknowledged the suffering of the Portuguese people since 2011, but insisted there was no prospect of easing up on his tough reform programme. Passos Coelho said Portugal had experienced: Three years of tough measures, a lot of sacrifices from the Portuguese people, but at the end we have been able to reconstruct some trust on the financial markets, trust in the people, and finally we are in a sustainable path to come back to growth, to growth . And having learned yesterday that the Portuguese economy shrank by 0.7% in the last quarter, Passos Coelho says Lisbon cannot change course, and will actually speed up We will maintain the fiscal responsibility, the necessary support to maintain financial stability and we will boost the reform momentum because as you know for the past three years we had a reform agenda in structural change, very import and we must maintain to keep, to stick this momentum for the future. As flagged up at 10.20am, analysts fear that the eurozone crisis could flare up again this year as government's lose the will to implement unpopular reforms. Passos Coelho, though, reckons Portugal can avoid reform fatigue, saying: We have less budget deficit, public deficit than other partners in Europe for instance like Spain or Ireland for instance. We have better conditions now to pay attention to job creation and the tradable sector of the economy. The full transcript is online here. Hundreds of Greek cleaning staff who lost their jobs in the government's austerity drive have won a \"landmark\" victory in the Athens courts, their lawyer said today. The Athens Court of First Instance accepted an appeal filed by around 400 Finance Ministry cleaners, who had been placed in the \"mobility scheme\" from where employees were redeployed or laid off. The cleaners have been a regular sight outside the finance ministry for months; on one occasion they famously forced Troika officials to flee down a fire escape. Angry workers have staged a running protest outside the Finance Ministry's headquarters on Nikis Street for months. The Kathimerini newspaper has more details: The court decision comes as the eight-month period of assessment, during which it is decided whether staff are transferred to another civil service post or dismissed, is set to expire. Hundreds of employees in other parts of the broader civil service including the education and health sectors have also protested the mobility scheme, most with industrial action such as strikes rather than legal appeals. Joao Monteiro, analyst at Valutrades, says traders are fearing that markets could be heading for a selloff: It's been a mixed end to the week for Asia equities as traders clearly remain unsettled by thoughts that a wider sell-off may be underway. The Nikkei fared worst after that downbeat US economic data added support to the Yen... On the basis that Wall Street stabilised last night and there hasn't been a catastrophic start to the day in Europe either, a full-blown correction may be avoided for now anyway, but it's difficult not to see the storm clouds as gathering. Back to the slowdown in European car sales, to just +4.6% in April. Carlos Da Silva, an analyst at IHS Automotive, argues that the market is still recovering -- although it would be frankly alarming if sales weren't higher than the dark days of 2012 and 2013. Da Silva wrote: \u201cWe must keep in mind that, in absolute terms, the level of sales is and should remain at a very low tide. There is still a long way to go before the E.U. turns into a healthy market.\u201d Analysts are warning that the industry won't return to its precrisis levels before the end of the decade. And the New York Times flags up that Europe is lagging the wider worldwide market: BMW, the German luxury carmaker, reported on Tuesday that its January-April sales rose 7.5 percent from the same period in 2013, putting it on track for global sales this year of two million vehicles \u2014 the most ever. But its European sales were up just 2.4 percent in the same period, weighed down by the weak showing of its Mini brand. On the subject of eurozone jitters (10.20am), Greek bonds continue to weaken today. Some traders are still concerned about a government paper that proposed a capital gains tax on investors who held Greek bonds in 2012 and 2013. Daniel Lenz, strategist at DZ Bank, said: \"There will be some investors that are concerned, and should take into consideration that is not just a one-day movement but something more prolonged.\" This has pushed up the interest rate on 10-year Greek debt to 6.92%, from 6.83% last night. Could this month's European elections trigger another phase of the euro crisis? Jane Foley, currency strategist at Rabobank, argues that there's been a clear \"souring of sentiment\" towards the euro area in recent days. with stock markets and bond prices both suffering. Greece\u2019s ASE is now down 3.36% in the year to date following a 12.25% retreat over the past 3 mths. Over the past 5 days, Spain\u2019s IBEX has dropped 1.4% while Portugal\u2019s PSI is down 4.8%. Established parties in many countries are heading for a shoeing at the ballot box this month, given the depth of public anger over the events of recent years. That will fan fears that political instability could reignite the crisis, at a time when sustained economic growth is elusive. Foley explains: Although the periphery has come a long way from the darkest darks of the economic crisis, opinion polls linked to this month\u2019s European elections serve as a reminder that economic struggles are still playing out. Specifically, discontent over high levels of unemployment and changes to living standards remain at extremely high levels and both European institutions and domestic political are being blamed. A recent national Greek opinion poll suggest that the PM\u2019s coalition partner Pasok has only 5.5% of a vote, with this party taking a lot of the blame for the crisis. If a general election were to be called now, this coalition would probably not survive. This suggests a rocky political landscape is still a potential threat in Greece. In Portugal too, opinion polls suggest that support for the ruling coalition has plunged and that anger stemming from the impact of the crisis is still extremely raw. In Spain too domestic political parties are also reportedly taking a lot of the blame for the continue impact of the crisis. The nature of democracy means that politicians seek to be popular. The implication is that momentum towards structural reform in Europe could be lost as general elections near. This is turn could dull the attraction of peripheral assets. The crisis may yet come back to bite us. No Sunday morning lie-in for me.... There's an edgy mood in Europe's financial markets today, with the main indices little changed after yesterday afternoon's selloff. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities reckons that traders are experiencing \"a bout of vertigo\" after the recent rallies. The news yesterday that the eurozone only grew by 0.2% last quarter continues to weigh on shares too. Ian Williams of Peel Hunt says the data: \"underline the continued fragility of domestic demand, especially in nations where Government policy seems to be hindering progress\". As witnessed in this morning's car sales figures.... E.ON's \u00a312m fine for mis-selling energy products to hundreds of thousands of customers is the latest proof that the market is broken, claims the opposition Labour party which promises to overhaul the industry. Jonathan Reynolds MP, Shadow Energy and Climate Change Minister, says: E.ON is just the latest in a long line of energy companies to be found guilty of misleading the public. The energy giants must know that if they mistreat customers already facing a cost-of-living crisis there will be a very heavy price to pay. In the UK, energy regulator Ofcom has torn into E.ON's \"extensive poor sales practices\", as it hits the company with a \u00a312m fine for misselling. And the final bill could hit \u00a320m, once the company has paid around \u00a335 compensation to 333,000 customers who were missold energy. Full story here. Analysts are also concerned that the pick-up in cars sales this year is due to aggressive price-cutting, and a growing trend of selling demonstration models as \"nearly new\", at a discount. Reuters recently found that various incentives and discounts are cutting 12% off the price of a car - good for consumers, but eating into profit margins and also pushing down inflation. That's another reason to fret about the news that growth slowed to +4.6% in April, from March's 10% jump. As the FT's Henry Foy puts it: Analysts will want to see whether heavy sales incentives and discounts -- which have ripped a hole in carmaker profitability -- are starting to come down before they pronounce the industry back on safe footing. This morning's car figures also show that mid-market brands, rathe than luxury models, are motoring off the forecourts. Sales of Dacia, the Romanian carmaker now part of Renault, are up 34% year-on-year in April. And Skoda sales are up 22%. In contrast, Mercedes-Benz registrations rose just 1.1% compared to April 2013, when Europe was in recession, while Audi sales were only 0.6% higher, and BMW were up 2.3%. European car sales have risen at their slowest rate in five months, adding to concerns over the durability of the recovery. Industry body ACEA reports this morning that new car registrations across the EU rose by 4.6%, year-on-year in April to 1,089,226. That's the the third lowest figure for an April since 2003. On the upside, this is the eighth month in a row when sales were higher than a year ago. And the late Easter this year probably won't have helped. But the concern is that the revival is tailing off, at levels that are still historically weak. Especially after yesterday's disappointing GDP figures. Car sales actually fell year-on-year in Germany, which doesn't suggest domestic demand in Europe's largest economy is going to drive the euro recovery strongly onwards. Sales were down 3.6% in Germany, compared to April 2013. The Italian market was little changed, up 1.9%. But they rose 5.8% in France, +8.2% in the UK, and +28.7% in Spain -- where a government scrappage scheme has been driving demand. Gian Primo Quagliano, head of automotive-research company CSP in Bologna, Italy, says the data shows there's no significant recovery in the industry - which employs hundreds of thousands of Europeans. Quagliano told Bloomberg. \u201cWe are not seeing a real recovery in the car market in Europe, just a modest rebound,\u201d \u201cEurope needs economic measures to boost consumption and bring back customers into showrooms.\u201d Here's their take: European Auto Sales Rise at Slowest Pace in Five Months So far this year, EU car sales have grown by 7.4% - and again, Germany is lagging behind. ACEA says: The increase in passenger car registrations in this period ranged from 2.9% in Germany, 3.7% in France, 5.0% in Italy to 12.5% in the UK and 16.2% in Spain.

The binding vote on future pay was introduced in October by the business secretary, Vince Cable.

Bovis's chief executive, David Ritchie, said the 80% increase showed the company was on track to meet targets. It aims to build between 3,650 and 3,850 homes this year. Housebuilding has reached levels not seen since the start of the financial crisis in 2007, as record-low interest rates, the government's Help-to-Buy mortgage subsidy scheme, and revival in the economy encourage people to move. The recovery caught some housebuilders off guard, leaving companies grappling with a shortage of bricks and workers. Bovis expects the cost of building its homes to increase by 5% in 2014, although the increasing costs will largely be offset by a rise in house prices. Sale prices have been running 3% above target prices set at the end of last year, with Bovis expecting a further 5% increase in 2014. Last week, a leading thinktank forecast that the boom in house prices would continue for at least a further two years before interest rate rises halt the process in 2017. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said prices would rise by 7.8% this year and by 4.2% next year, but slow to a 0.9% increase in 2016.",

    "webTitle": "London property - the 'barbarous relic' of our times | Bob Swarup", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In 1924, the economist John Maynard Keynes condemned gold as \"a barbarous relic\", setting in motion a near century-long partisan debate between goldbugs and bears. The world has moved on since then. The \"barbarous relic\" is still with us, but these days it is called London property. There has been much talk in recent months of London property and the rapid rises there, with commentators alternately blaming a resurgent debt culture and debating what the Bank of England needs to do to cool the market. Certainly, if one was to take the central borough of Westminster as an example, property prices have risen by 17.5% in the last year and by 44% in the last three years. Throw out the piddling studios and minor beds, narrowing down to larger and more expensive properties, and the numbers show an even more aggressive expansion. Central London property has actually now become too expensive even for bankers, the one-time masters of the universe, and has the pungent whiff of a renewed bubble. But there is one crucial difference between the market now and the one before 2008. This is less a market driven by speculation and more one driven by fear. The last few years have seen a succession of geopolitical and social troubles. On 23 April 2010, the Greek government asked the EU and IMF for a short-term loan to cover its debt obligations. Over the next 12 months, a succession of peripheral euro nations joined the queue for a bailout as their punitive debt burdens became clear. This was the beginning of the eurozone sovereign debt crisis. We are still far from resolving both its financial and sociopolitical fallout. In December 2010, Mohamed Bouazizi, a Tunisian street vendor, set himself on fire in protest against local corruption and personal economic hardship. His death unleashed the Arab spring as entire populations across north Africa and the Middle East gave vent to their frustration at a growing social and wealth divide. More recently, tensions have erupted between Russia and Ukraine; the fast growing Brics of the emerging markets ran into a sudden wall; concerns have mounted over shadow banking and the potential for a debt crisis in China; Turkey cleansed its judiciary and army, while attempting to also ban Twitter; and so on. The collective effect of all these has been massive capital flows out of these regions as wealthy locals rush to preserve their fortunes in uncertain times. One of the biggest beneficiaries of this flight to quality has been London. Central London property has become the safe haven of choice for countless Russians, Chinese, Italians, Greeks, Arabs and so on. This is the modern form of hoarding. There appears little difference between burying gold coins in the back garden in the declining days of the Roman empire and buying a house or apartment today in central London. Money is fundamentally a social construct and property has transmuted into a form of this. Like gold (or any good currency), property is scarce in the desirable parts of London. It cannot be produced in large quantities, thanks to the restrictions of geography and planning. It is widely accepted and easily exchanged, as there appears to be an ever willing stream of buyers. It is durable (for at least the next few years) and the risk of confiscation by an over-zealous government seems low in the UK. All of these are attractive facets in a time of heightened economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and also in an environment where aggressive monetary stimulus threatens to devalue traditional cash. Thus, like gold, property prices have spiked as people rush to safety and fret about the corrosive effects of uncertainty. Unfortunately, also like gold, this barbarous relic houses the seeds of its own bust. One day, the world will get better. No country went bust forever. And rates will eventually go from lower for longer to higher sooner than planned. When that happens, these capital flows will dry up and then reverse, as money comes back out of hiding and looks for opportunities elsewhere to multiply. Additionally, between safe haven and the steady decline in rental yields, central London property threatens to also emulate the least attractive facet of gold \u2013 namely, that it produces no income. Meanwhile, it remains an unproductive use of capital. We may all feel wealthier and more secure with every tick upwards, but like hoarded gold, the savings that lie locked among the cobbled streets of London do not circulate through the economy. They are, therefore, valueless and only accentuate the fundamental problem that persists today despite our weak recovery, namely low-monetary velocity. The Roman empire died, not when the barbarians came, but when money left, burrowing itself underground never to return. An economy needs transactions to live and thrive. In their absence, any growth perceived through the rose-tinted glasses of rising house prices is empty. As others rush to keep up, this creates a vicious rippling circle of more hoarding and less capital for other parts of the economy. Thus, any growth is also fragile, unsustainable, of dubious quality and stokes social envy. The barbarous relic is alive and well. Yet, we grow poorer as a society even as we feel richer individually. \u2022 Bob Swarup is a London-based investor and commentator on macroeconomics, financial markets and regulation.
