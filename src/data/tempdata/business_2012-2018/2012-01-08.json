An improving labor market is likely to be a major boost to his re-election chances next November, as he will inevitably claim that despite the opposition of his many critics, his policies had successfully put America back to work. </p> <p>And he would surely have a point: the improvement represents a major problem for the Republicans \u2013 who have opposed these policies tooth and nail.</p> <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday that the jobs market was improving according to almost every measure that labor economists like me focus on, continuing the trend that first started in the early fall. The BLS reports labor market data from a household survey of individuals aged 16 and over: according to this survey, the number of unemployed fell by 126,000 on the month and 2.1 million below its May 2010 peak. The numbers of employed people was up 180,000 on the month, using these data, and 1.5 million on the year. The unemployment rate fell, unexpectedly, between November and December, from 8.7% to 8.5%, and down from 9.1% in September, while the participation rate was unchanged. The numbers of the long-term unemployed, who had been without work for at least six months, also fell.</p> <p>In addition to households, the BLS collects job market data from firms, so there are two sources of jobs data. The coverage of the household survey is somewhat broader as it includes the self-employed, unpaid family workers and private household workers. According to the establishment survey, non-farm payrolls were up 200,000 this month, similar to the estimates from the household survey (some months they can be very different). According to this survey, employment is up 1.7 million on the year. There is evidence, from both household and employer surveys, that wage growth remains muted because workers have little power in a recession and are fearful of losing their jobs if they ask for higher compensation, plus an employer's ability to pay is restricted in these tough economic times. Still, the consistent theme is that the labor market is improving, which is very encouraging.</p> <p>Signs of an improving jobs market in the United States stands in direct contrast to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/06/eurozone-grim-economic-data\">what is happening in Europe</a>. On the same day as the BLS announcement, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/06/eurozone-debt-crisis-euro-pound\">European statistical office Eurostat published</a> unemployment rates for the EU27, which showed unemployment increasing on the month in Denmark (7.8%), France (9.8%), Greece (18.8), Italy (8.6%), the Netherlands (4.9%), Portugal (13.2%), Spain (22.9%) and the UK (8.3%), although it did fall in Germany (5.5%). Youth unemployment rates in Europe are especially rising fast and are over 30% in Italy, Portugal and Spain \u2013 approximately double US rates.</p> <p>The evidence from the labor market is also consistent with evidence on consumer confidence, which is worsening in Europe and improving in the US. <a href=\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/eurostat/home/\">Eurostat also published its monthly consumer confidence survey</a>, which is falling fast in both the EU27 and in the euro area. In contrast, consumer confidence in the US is rising; for example, the <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-22/leading-economic-indicators-in-u-s-rise-more-than-forecast.html\">Conference Board's consumer confidence index</a> was up from 40.9 in October, to 55.2 in November to 64.5 in December.</p> <p>So, why the contrast in labor market conditions \u2013 the US improving and Europe worsening?</p> <p>One simple explanation is that the US entered recession first and was always going to emerge first. Second, unemployment in the US rose more rapidly than it did in the major west European countries because the scale of the monetary and fiscal stimulus was relatively greater outside the US, where federal stimulus had to compensate for declines in spending in states and municipalities which were balancing budgets. But now, despite all the Tea Party-inspired talk against stimulus, the US has largely maintained public spending, while the Europeans imposed bludgeoning austerity too soon. Tight fiscal policy along with the still unnecessarily restrictive monetary policy being run by the European Central Bank has pushed Europe back into recession \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/03/ecb-must-act-stop-eurozone-collapse\">as many of us warned would happen</a>.</p> <p>The UK was always going to be an important laboratory experiment for the US, as it imposed austerity by choice. This strategy has demonstrably failed, as the UK economy looks to have gone back into recession, public borrowing is on the rise, business and consumer confidence and spending have collapsed and unemployment is rising inexorably. <a href=\"http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-04-09/markets/30062152_1_global-economy-retail-sales-data-stagflation\">Larry Summers' claim last year</a> that the whole idea of an expansionary fiscal contraction is \"oxymoronic\" looks to have been right.</p> <p>The various Republican presidential candidates who have moved from Iowa to my home state of New Hampshire for this week's primary have collectively argued for European-style retrenchment \u2013 which simply hasn't worked. Drastic cuts in public spending any time soon, as proposed by several of these candidates, look wildly irresponsible given the headwinds the US economy is facing from abroad.</p> <p>My fellow voters in next week's primary are entitled to know why the Republicans are opposed to a jobs strategy that is so obviously now working. A litmus test for me at this primary is whether a candidate supports a renewal of the payroll tax cuts that were given just a two-month reprieve at the end of the year. </p> <p>It really is all about jobs, jobs and more jobs this week and in November. The obstructionist Republicans have no credible alternative on offer to get America back to work \u2013 and that is a major gift to Obama.</p>",

In contrast, consumer confidence in the US is rising; for example, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index was up from 40.9 in October, to 55.2 in November to 64.5 in December. So, why the contrast in labor market conditions \u2013 the US improving and Europe worsening? One simple explanation is that the US entered recession first and was always going to emerge first. Second, unemployment in the US rose more rapidly than it did in the major west European countries because the scale of the monetary and fiscal stimulus was relatively greater outside the US, where federal stimulus had to compensate for declines in spending in states and municipalities which were balancing budgets. But now, despite all the Tea Party-inspired talk against stimulus, the US has largely maintained public spending, while the Europeans imposed bludgeoning austerity too soon. Tight fiscal policy along with the still unnecessarily restrictive monetary policy being run by the European Central Bank has pushed Europe back into recession \u2013 as many of us warned would happen. The UK was always going to be an important laboratory experiment for the US, as it imposed austerity by choice. This strategy has demonstrably failed, as the UK economy looks to have gone back into recession, public borrowing is on the rise, business and consumer confidence and spending have collapsed and unemployment is rising inexorably. Larry Summers' claim last year that the whole idea of an expansionary fiscal contraction is \"oxymoronic\" looks to have been right. The various Republican presidential candidates who have moved from Iowa to my home state of New Hampshire for this week's primary have collectively argued for European-style retrenchment \u2013 which simply hasn't worked. Drastic cuts in public spending any time soon, as proposed by several of these candidates, look wildly irresponsible given the headwinds the US economy is facing from abroad. My fellow voters in next week's primary are entitled to know why the Republicans are opposed to a jobs strategy that is so obviously now working. A litmus test for me at this primary is whether a candidate supports a renewal of the payroll tax cuts that were given just a two-month reprieve at the end of the year. It really is all about jobs, jobs and more jobs this week and in November. The obstructionist Republicans have no credible alternative on offer to get America back to work \u2013 and that is a major gift to Obama.",

      "bodyText": "The novelist and polymath Anthony Burgess published a selection of book reviews and essays in the 1980s called Homage to QWERT YUIOP. One of the pieces was called The Whip and in it Burgess discussed le vice Anglais, the derisory term given by the French to the masochistic sexual preferences of upper-class Brits. Burgess was in no doubt that the taste for the whip had affected the way Britain had been run, and he was probably right about that. In the 1970s, the Bank of England had an instrument for controlling the amount of credit in the economy, which its practitioners lovingly called the corset. Enough said. When Denis Healey accused the Thatcher administration of punk monetarism everybody got the reference. With its references to fiscal restraint and the tightness of monetary policy, economic management at the time was coloured by the language of the dominatrix \u2013 and still is, of course. Why was this? Burgess thought it had quite a lot to do with the British public school system in which there existed \"a kind of bond of shameful-shameless intimacy between the members of the ruling class those schools were concerned with turning out. To have beaten, been beaten, witnessed the same beatings is a red badge of something.\" If he was writing today, Burgess would probably not be surprised by the alacrity and relish with which David Cameron (Eton), George Osborne (St Paul's Boys) and Nick Clegg (Westminster) accepted the need for painful austerity on their arrival in power in May 2010. What might exercise his brain would be the way in which \u2013 in economic terms, at least \u2013 le vice Anglais is no longer confined to these shores but has become the fetish du jour across the whole of Europe. Take the report in Saturday's Guardian which said retail sales and economic confidence were down, Italian bond yields were well above the crisis threshold of 7% and Spanish unemployment had risen to 22.9%. The response from Europe's policy elite? \"Italy's prime minister, Mario Monti, met [Nicolas] Sarkozy in Paris to discuss a pact between eurozone countries to be signed in March, giving Brussels oversight on debt levels and allowing it to punish countries that breach the rules.\" Yes, that's right. Countries are expected to suck demand out of their economies through tax increases and spending cuts and when the slower growth that results in means the target for deficit reduction is not met, they will be punished for it. The language of S&amp;M is also now part of the eurozone discourse. The joint letter sent last month by Sarkozy and Angela Merkel to Herman van Rompuy, president of the European Council, explaining the Franco-German plans for future governance of the single currency stressed \"fiscal discipline\" and the need to \"detect and correct departures from sound economic and fiscal policies long before they become a threat to the stability of the euro area as a whole\". There's plenty of raw material here, given a tweak or two, for a modern version of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's Venus in Furs. \"Mario, you have allowed the Italian budget deficit to rise above 3% of gross domestic product.\" \"Yes, mistress Angela, I deserve to be punished for my lack of fiscal discipline. Please do not spare me.\" Spain is perhaps the best current example of the predilection for pain. The new conservative government of Mariano Rajoy has inherited a budget deficit running at 8.7% of GDP in the first nine months of 2011 and has set a target of reducing it to 4.4% of GDP in 2012 and 3% in 2013. This involves taking \u20ac40bn (\u00a333bn) out of the economy this year by a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts. The Spanish economy came to a standstill in the third quarter of last year and the crisis in the eurozone means it will almost certainly shrink in the fourth quarter. The fiscal policy planned by the new government will make that recession worse, and a contraction of at least 1.5% looks likely in 2012. The rationale for this plan is that budgetary retrenchment is the only way to keep the financial markets happy, thus leading to a fall in long-term borrowing costs. This notion that pain is the way to pleasure is now the orthodoxy across Europe (including the UK). Yet as Jamie Dannhauser of Lombard Street Research notes, Spain's real problem is the overhang of private sector debt from the housing bubble, which has left the banks in a precarious state. To the extent that there are concerns about the solvency of the state, they are due to fears that lenders will go belly-up leaving Madrid to pick up the pieces. Spain is uncompetitive internationally and has a dysfunctional labour market, but compared to Greece, Italy and Portugal it has a relatively low level of public debt. Opinions might differ on what the right remedy for Spain's economic ills should be. Some might argue that the solution is a cheaper currency, others that there needs to be root-and-branch supply side reform to sort out the labour market. Still others might suggest that for Spain to survive inside the single currency there needs to be the immediate launch of common eurobonds to fund large-scale infrastructure projects. Any one of these approaches makes more sense than the strategy being pursued by Rajoy, which has not the slightest hope of working. As Dannhauser notes in a piece titled \"Spain's new year resolution \u2013 more fiscal masochism\", the government is seeking to halve its budget deficit in two years. But the only way it can do this without causing a deep recession is if there is offsetting action by the private sector to boost activity. Specifically, this means either an improvement in the current account, consumers running down their savings to spend more, or businesses stepping up investment (or a combination of all three). None of these is remotely likely. High unemployment means consumers are saving rather than spending; companies are uncertain about the future and want to sit on whatever cash they have; Spain has high unit labour costs that make its exports expensive even in the best of times, which these are assuredly not. \"Since the other sectors of the economy do not appear willing to (fully) offset the reduction in the government deficit, the result is likely to be an even deeper and more prolonged recession,\" Dannhauser concludes. \"This is pain for pain's sake because it will further damage market confidence in the long-term health of the Spanish economy and the banking system in particular.\" Absolutely right \u2013 and not confined to Spain either. This sort of aberrant behaviour is now commonplace across the eurozone where, unlike in Britain, it cannot be blamed on the peculiarities of the educational system. Perhaps a Freud or a Jung could explain what is happening: it certainly defies rational economic analysis. larry.elliott@guardian.co.uk guardian.co.uk/business/economics \u2022 This article was amended on 27 January 2012.

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Richard Branson's Virgin group is a diverse array of businesses \u2013 few wholly owned by the unconventional entrepreneur himself", 
      "body": "<p>The sprawling business empire that makes up Richard Branson's Virgin investment group consists of about 400 operations, a tangled web of enterprises owned via a complicated series of offshore trusts and overseas holding companies.</p> <p>Branson's finances are difficult to penetrate because of their complexity and opaqueness, with few of his large companies wholly owned by Branson himself. His big-branded firms such as Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Money, Virgin Media and Virgin Trains have other major shareholders. In some cases, he simply licenses the brand to a company that has purchased a subsidiary from him, and these include Virgin Mobile USA, Virgin Mobile Australia, Virgin Radio and Virgin Music (now part of EMI). In return, as the licence holder of the Virgin brand, he receives annual or triennial fees that can amount to hundreds of millions over time.</p> <p>By forging partnerships with cash-rich allies, Branson has established new businesses without depleting the group's reserves and spending little to establish new ventures in sectors such as mobile telecoms. But initiatives come straight from&#xa0;Branson, who prides himself&#xa0;on his ability to spot a gap in the market. He is not a numbers or a details man and leaves the everyday running of his firms to a group of lieutenants.</p> <p>According to a spokesman for Branson, \"branded revenue from companies that bear the Virgin name\" topped \u00a313bn last year. Branson himself is estimated to be worth more than \u00a33bn.</p> <p>He went into business in 1966 after leaving school at 16, publishing The Student magazine from the basement of a rented flat. He rapidly expanded into the world of pop music, starting a mail-order business that sent records through the post to tens of thousands of teenagers, and set up Virgin Records, a chain of shops, with the first one opening off London's Oxford Street in 1971. Two years later he launched the Virgin Records label after clinching the rights to Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells and attracted a growing roster of artists that included the Sex Pistols, Genesis, and the Rolling Stones.</p> <p>In 1984, Branson diversified, leasing his first 747 to fly to New York from Gatwick, giving birth to upstart airline Virgin Atlantic, which was soon competing with British Airways at Heathrow.</p> <p>BA's so-called \"dirty tricks\" campaign against Virgin rocked the industry in the early 90s: BA argued that Branson's protests against it were a publicity stunt. Branson sued BA for libel. BA settled out of court when its lawyers discovered the lengths to which the company went to try to kill off Virgin, and was forced to pay substantial damages.</p> <p>Amid rumours that Branson needed cash to underpin parts of his business at the turn of the millennium, he announced in 2000 that Virgin Group had sold 49% of the airline's holding company to Singapore Airlines for more than \u00a3600m.</p> <p>In 2005-06, Branson was busy assembling the Virgin Media group that today competes with BT and Sky for entertainment, phone and broadband customers. The formation of Virgin Media is a classic Branson business venture: he owns a tiny stake in the business that is listed on the Nasdaq exchange in New York, but derives tens of&#xa0;millions by licensing the brand&#xa0;name.

      "bodyText": "The sprawling business empire that makes up Richard Branson's Virgin investment group consists of about 400 operations, a tangled web of enterprises owned via a complicated series of offshore trusts and overseas holding companies. Branson's finances are difficult to penetrate because of their complexity and opaqueness, with few of his large companies wholly owned by Branson himself. His big-branded firms such as Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Money, Virgin Media and Virgin Trains have other major shareholders. In some cases, he simply licenses the brand to a company that has purchased a subsidiary from him, and these include Virgin Mobile USA, Virgin Mobile Australia, Virgin Radio and Virgin Music (now part of EMI). In return, as the licence holder of the Virgin brand, he receives annual or triennial fees that can amount to hundreds of millions over time. By forging partnerships with cash-rich allies, Branson has established new businesses without depleting the group's reserves and spending little to establish new ventures in sectors such as mobile telecoms. But initiatives come straight from Branson, who prides himself on his ability to spot a gap in the market. He is not a numbers or a details man and leaves the everyday running of his firms to a group of lieutenants. According to a spokesman for Branson, \"branded revenue from companies that bear the Virgin name\" topped \u00a313bn last year. Branson himself is estimated to be worth more than \u00a33bn. He went into business in 1966 after leaving school at 16, publishing The Student magazine from the basement of a rented flat. He rapidly expanded into the world of pop music, starting a mail-order business that sent records through the post to tens of thousands of teenagers, and set up Virgin Records, a chain of shops, with the first one opening off London's Oxford Street in 1971. Two years later he launched the Virgin Records label after clinching the rights to Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells and attracted a growing roster of artists that included the Sex Pistols, Genesis, and the Rolling Stones. In 1984, Branson diversified, leasing his first 747 to fly to New York from Gatwick, giving birth to upstart airline Virgin Atlantic, which was soon competing with British Airways at Heathrow. BA's so-called \"dirty tricks\" campaign against Virgin rocked the industry in the early 90s: BA argued that Branson's protests against it were a publicity stunt. Branson sued BA for libel. BA settled out of court when its lawyers discovered the lengths to which the company went to try to kill off Virgin, and was forced to pay substantial damages. Amid rumours that Branson needed cash to underpin parts of his business at the turn of the millennium, he announced in 2000 that Virgin Group had sold 49% of the airline's holding company to Singapore Airlines for more than \u00a3600m. In 2005-06, Branson was busy assembling the Virgin Media group that today competes with BT and Sky for entertainment, phone and broadband customers. The formation of Virgin Media is a classic Branson business venture: he owns a tiny stake in the business that is listed on the Nasdaq exchange in New York, but derives tens of millions by licensing the brand name. He is not on the Virgin Media board and the company is run by chief executive Neil Berkett. Branson has also had his fair share of flops. There was a series of them in the mid-90s, including Virgin Brides, Virgin Cola (pictured) and Virgin Cosmetics. He has never been a friend of the City. The relationship soured in the late 1980s when he listed his Virgin music business on the stock market, and the share price bombed. An outraged Branson took the company private, buying out institutional shareholders who he claimed did not understand the business. In 1992, he made a mint when he sold the company for \u00a3560m to EMI. Virgin Trains was launched in 1997 and Branson has ridden out a period when passenger complaints soared.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Financial crisis could turn the tide against unrestricted capital flows", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Watching as the Spanish government announced drastic new austerity measures, you could have been forgiven for thinking that neoliberal orthodoxy holds sway almost as decisively as when Alan Greenspan was the maestro of the Federal Reserve. But away from Brussels, one element at least of the neoliberal canon \u2013 the idea that capital must be allowed to flow unchecked around the world \u2013 is coming under sustained attack. The theory says that free capital flows allow savings to be directed \u2013 by the invisible hand of the financial markets \u2013 to wherever they will be most profitably employed. In this way, savers get a better return on their nest egg, while underdeveloped economies receive the financial leg-up they need. And as firms from one country take over those of another, they bring much-needed expertise as well as help new ideas to be adopted rapidly worldwide. Except that isn't what's been happening: instead, for the past decade and more, savings have been pouring uphill from poor countries to rich. Whether you call it a savings glut or a borrowing binge (two sides of the same coin), it has led to a flood of money sluicing through financial markets, looking for a home. And far from nurturing development and improving the standard of living of the poorest, these vast flows of money have created a repeated pattern of boom, bust and financial crisis. When the climate is \"risk on\", as they say in Wall Street and Canary Wharf, capital rains down on the fashionable economies of the moment. But a change in mood \u2013 or an increase in interest rates in Washington, say \u2013 can, like the proverbial flap of a distant butterfly wing, unleash an economic storm as capital floods back out again. A recent paper by thinktank the Bretton Woods Project, Time for a New Consensus, enumerates five major threats of unregulated capital flows. There is currency risk, because large inflows can push up a country's exchange rate (you need to buy Turkish lira if you want to buy a firm in Istanbul). An overvalued currency undermines domestic exporters and leaves them unable to compete. There is flight risk, because funds often leave as rapidly as they arrive, pulling the rug out from under local businesses and stunting economic growth. Contagion risk is the threat that close financial links between economies means a shock in one can drag everyone down \u2013 as shown by the devastating knock-on effects of the US sub-prime crisis over the past four years. Fragility risk occurs when an economy becomes heavily dependent on borrowing from overseas, often in foreign currencies. Hungarian households took out mortgages in euros in the runup to the credit crisis, for example, as their country prepared to join the single currency. That meant the sharp decline in the forint took a severe economic and social toll when the crisis hit, as the loans spiralled in value relative to homeowners' wages. Finally, sovereignty risk, chillingly familiar to a string of crisis-hit countries across the world in the past two decades, is the threat that instead of overseas investment giving governments the resources they need to improve the livelihoods of their population, politicians are left with little or no control over their own economies. Increasing domestic interest rates to control an unsustainable boom has little impact if cut-price capital keeps flooding in. Not surprisingly, large developing countries have long been suspicious of the west's insistence that its banks and corporations must be allowed to bestride the world, unrestrained by government interference. The World Trade Organisation summit in Canc\u00fan in 2003, part of the now dormant Doha round, collapsed because the rich world insisted that the so-called Singapore issues, which included removing restrictions on foreign investment, must be part of any bargain. Developing countries objected so vehemently they walked out. Since the onset of the credit crunch in 2007, those countries \u2013 including China and India \u2013 that have kept tight control over financial inflows have fared better than those that have thrown open their borders. And in recent years, several countries have quietly begun erecting breakwaters against the latest tidal wave of capital, driven by low interest rates in the west. Brazil, Argentina and Costa Rica have used various measures, including taxes on purchases of shares and bonds and insisting that short-term investors deposit funds with the central bank for a year, to dampen the stop-go cycle. It doesn't mean no investment; just trying to discriminate between long-term capital that will help to deliver jobs and sustainable growth and the short-term whims of the herd. The International Monetary Fund responded to growing pressure for a rethink last year and issued two papers acknowledging that regulations on capital flows could be useful. But it suggested their use should be restricted to crises and governed by a strict code of conduct. That idea was rejected by emerging economies, which are wielding growing influence at the Washington-based lender. The G20, a forum in which China, India and Brazil have a strong voice, issued its own far more radical study in October. The tide is turning. One unlikely recent champion of the reintroduction of regulations on capital flows is the Bank of England. The shock of being caught unawares by the vulnerability of the UK's financial system in 2007 and 2008 caused soul-searching in Threadneedle Street, and recent papers and speeches have helped build the case for new thinking. Two research studies in particular, released last month, suggested cross-border flows of capital will increase radically in the coming years as developing countries grow in size; that the UK will be particularly vulnerable to future sudden reversals in these flows, because of its vast external balance sheet; and that the international community should consider drawing up a set of rules governing how and when countries can act to protect themselves. If there's one thing policymakers should have learned over the past four years, it's that financial markets can't be left to run the world themselves.",

      "body": "<p>Watching as the Spanish government announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/30/debt-crisis-spain\" title=\"\">drastic new austerity measures</a>, you could have been forgiven for thinking that neoliberal orthodoxy holds sway almost as decisively as when Alan Greenspan was the maestro of the Federal Reserve.</p> <p>But away from Brussels, one element at least of the neoliberal canon \u2013 the idea that capital must be allowed to flow unchecked around the world \u2013 is coming under sustained attack.</p> <p>The theory says that free capital flows allow savings to be directed \u2013 by the invisible hand of the financial markets \u2013 to wherever they will be most profitably employed. In this way, savers get a better return on their nest egg, while underdeveloped economies receive the financial leg-up they need. And as firms from one country take over those of another, they bring much-needed expertise as well as help new ideas to be adopted rapidly worldwide.</p> <p>Except that isn't what's been happening: instead, for the past decade and more, savings have been pouring uphill from poor countries to rich. Whether you call it a savings glut or a borrowing binge (two sides of the same coin), it has led to a flood of money sluicing through financial markets, looking for a home. And far from nurturing development and improving the standard of living of the poorest, these vast flows of money have created a repeated pattern of boom, bust and financial crisis.</p> <p>When the climate is \"risk on\", as they say in Wall Street and Canary Wharf, capital rains down on the fashionable economies of the moment. But a change in mood \u2013 or an increase in interest rates in Washington, say \u2013 can, like the proverbial flap of a distant butterfly wing, unleash an economic storm as capital floods back out again.</p> <p>A recent paper by thinktank the Bretton Woods Project, <a href=\"http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/art-569411\" title=\"\">Time for a New Consensus,</a> enumerates five major threats of unregulated capital flows. There is currency risk, because large inflows can push up a country's exchange rate (you need to buy Turkish lira if you want to buy a firm in Istanbul). An overvalued currency undermines domestic exporters and leaves them unable to compete. There is flight risk, because funds often leave as rapidly as they arrive, pulling the rug out from under local businesses and stunting economic growth.</p> <p>Contagion risk is the threat that close financial links between economies means a shock in one can drag everyone down \u2013 as shown by the devastating knock-on effects of the US sub-prime crisis over the past four years.</p> <p>Fragility risk occurs when an economy becomes heavily dependent on borrowing from overseas, often in foreign currencies. Hungarian households took out mortgages in euros in the runup to the credit crisis, for example, as their country prepared to join the single currency. That meant the sharp decline in the forint took a severe economic and social toll when the crisis hit, as the loans spiralled in value relative to homeowners' wages.</p> <p>Finally, sovereignty risk, chillingly familiar to a string of crisis-hit countries across the world in the past two decades, is the threat that instead of overseas investment giving governments the resources they need to improve the livelihoods of their population, politicians are left with little or no control over their own economies. Increasing domestic interest rates to control an unsustainable boom has little impact if cut-price capital keeps flooding in.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, large developing countries have long been suspicious of the west's insistence that its banks and corporations must be allowed to bestride the world, unrestrained by government interference.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/wto/cancun/0,13815,1018998,00.html\" title=\"\">World Trade Organisation summit in Canc\u00fan in 2003</a>, part of the now dormant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/21/globaleconomy.wto\" title=\"\">Doha round</a>, collapsed because the rich world insisted that the so-called Singapore issues, which included removing restrictions on foreign investment, must be part of any bargain. Developing countries objected so vehemently they walked out.</p> <p>Since the onset of the credit crunch in 2007, those countries \u2013 including China and India \u2013 that have kept tight control over financial inflows have fared better than those that have thrown open their borders.</p> <p>And in recent years, several countries have quietly begun erecting breakwaters against the latest tidal wave of capital, driven by low interest rates in the west. Brazil, Argentina and Costa Rica have used various measures, including taxes on purchases of shares and bonds and insisting that short-term investors deposit funds with the central bank for a year, to dampen the stop-go cycle.</p> <p>It doesn't mean no investment; just trying to discriminate between long-term capital that will help to deliver jobs and sustainable growth and the short-term whims of the herd.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund responded to growing pressure for a rethink last year and issued two papers acknowledging that regulations on capital flows could be useful. But it suggested their use should be restricted to crises and governed by a strict code of conduct. That idea was rejected by emerging economies, which are wielding growing influence at the Washington-based lender. The G20, a forum in which China, India and Brazil have a strong voice, issued its own far more radical study in October. The tide is turning.</p> <p>One unlikely recent champion of the reintroduction of regulations on capital flows is the Bank of England. The shock of being caught unawares by the vulnerability of the UK's financial system in 2007 and 2008 caused soul-searching in Threadneedle Street, and recent papers and speeches have helped build the case for new thinking.</p> <p>Two research studies in particular, released last month, suggested cross-border flows of capital will increase radically in the coming years as developing countries grow in size; that the UK will be particularly vulnerable to future sudden reversals in these flows, because of its vast external balance sheet; and that the international community should consider drawing up a set of rules governing how and when countries can act to protect themselves.</p> <p>If there's one thing policymakers should have learned over the past four years, it's that financial markets can't be left to run the world themselves.</p>",
