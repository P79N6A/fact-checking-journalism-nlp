      "bodyText": "Mayfair property tycoon Vincent Tchenguiz has accused one of his oldest friends of attempting to hijack a multimillion pound legal dispute by including a catalogue of allegations designed to embarrass him. Keyvan Rahimian had been a family friend of Tchenguiz since the two were children growing up in pre-revolution Tehran, and years later went to work for Tchenguiz's UK property empire. The two were so close Rahimian socialised regularly with Tchenguiz and lived in his home for about nine years. Rahimian told the high court in London they had been \"akin to brothers\" before a bitter falling out in late 2008. The two men have lodged legal claims against one another, with Rahimian claiming Tchenguiz failed to honour commission payments on certain property deals and Tchenguiz claiming Rahimian had failed to account for investments he was supposed to have made using funds from the property baron. Rahimian claims to be owed \u00a36.7m, while Tchenguiz says he is due more than \u00a32m. In their opening submission to the court, Tchenguiz's lawyers said: \"It has become increasingly apparent from both correspondence and then [Rahimian's] witness statement that it is intended to fight the case at least in part on other grounds.\" In particular the lawyers pointed to a series of allegations they argued were \"tangential\" and which Rahimian \"has plainly sought to make reference to \u2026 in the belief they will secure him advantage either before or during the trial.\" Specifically, there is a reference to allegations, allegedly put by Rahimian in \"salacious terms\", that models were recruited to attend Tchenguiz's parties.

Should the need arise, is it credible that Varley could deliver a dressing-down to Bob Diamond, his successor at Barclays and long-time colleague? Voters might find that hard to imagine: a former commercial banker policing commercial banks sounds a tricky proposition for the government to sell. What do the markets think? Jim Leaviss at M&amp;G, a big bond investor, reflecting on the latest rumours that Lord Sassoon, commercial secretary to the Treasury, could also be a candidate as a Bank outsider, wrote on Wednesday: \"I've no view on Lord Sassoon, but I would be disappointed if Paul Tucker, current deputy governor, didn't get the top job. I think markets would too \u2013 he has the right mixture of intellect, pragmatism and experience to cope with the future issues that the ongoing credit crisis will throw at the UK.\" One suspects the view of the market will be heard more loudly once the appointment process officially starts.

Jim Leaviss at M&amp;G, a big bond investor, reflecting on the latest rumours that Lord Sassoon, commercial secretary to the Treasury, could also be a candidate as a Bank outsider, wrote on Wednesday: \"I've no view on Lord Sassoon, but I&#xa0;would be disappointed if Paul Tucker, current deputy governor, didn't get the top job. I think markets would too \u2013 he&#xa0;has the right mixture of intellect, pragmatism and experience to cope with the future issues that the ongoing credit crisis will throw at the UK.\"</p> <p>One suspects the view of the market will be heard more loudly once the appointment process officially starts. Tucker, at 11-4 (second favourite behind Lord Turner at 5-2), still looks the sensible bet.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A couple of decades ago a lively debate raged within the John Lewis Partnership: should Waitrose be ditched? More than a few partners in the department stores, regarding themselves as the organisation's royalty, resented how the grubby grocer, struggling to find a foothold in the supermarket game, was diluting the staff bonus pool. That pool, remember, is distributed on a \"one partnership, one bonus\" basis, a principle that was tricky to defend when Waitrose was adding lots of partners but not bringing in much profit. And today? The position has reversed entirely. Waitrose had a less than vintage year last year \u2013 operating profits were down 5% to \u00a3261m \u2013 but the department stores had a stinker. Some 28 out of 29 shops suffered lower sales (Peter Jones, shopkeeper to the posh folk of Kensington and Chelsea, was the exception) and operating profits fell 20% to \u00a3158m. Another year like that and Waitrose's profits contribution will be twice the department stores'. Should Waitrose workers now be resentful? Well, not yet. There are many more of them than there are department store employees: on a crude cash-profit-per-partner measure, they are only slightly ahead of their department store colleagues. What about the future, though? What would happen if Waitrose were to pull further ahead, not just in total profits but in profits-per-partner? Would harmony within the partnership survive a permanent shift in the make-up of the business? The bosses' hope, of course, is that the question will never arise: they're trusting that profits from the department stores, traditionally more cyclical, will come roaring back. And now there's another factor at play - more integration and executive chairman Charlie Mayfield's pursuit of \"customer centricity\". For example: online shoppers can now order John Lewis goods to be collected from 129 Waitrose stores. Some of those shoppers will also buy a few groceries when they collect. Should the department stores get a commission for that trade? How could it be measured? Well, yes, operating lines will inevitably become blurred. But even in a decade's time, the partnership will almost certainly still be reporting separate profit lines for Waitrose and John Lewis. If the gap in performance continues to widen, Mayfield, or his successor, could yet have a problem in defending the \"we're all in this together\" philosophy at bonus time. To be fair, it's a problem (if it arises) for the next decade rather than this one. But, by then, the charity of John Lewis partners in tolerating Waitrose's stumbles in the early 1990s will be forgotten.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The staff bonus at the John Lewis Partnership has become the latest casualty of the high street downturn after falling annual profits reduced the size of payouts to workers in its department stores and supermarket chain, Waitrose, for the first time in three years. Its 81,000 staff will get an extra seven weeks pay in this month's pay packet compared with nine weeks they picked up last year. Profits at its department stores, in particular, were battered by ferocious discounting elsewhere on the high street. With group profits down 4% at \u00a3353.8m, the bonus pool shrank with staff receiving a bonus equal to 14% of annual salary compared with 18% in 2011. Its chairman Charlie Mayfield said that after the toughest year for retailers since the onset of the financial crisis it was not surprising the bonus was \"somewhat lower\": \"The bonus does go up and down. It's very important it does, otherwise it would not reflect the performance of the business.\" The average bonus payment for the last five years is 15% but it has fallen to as low as 4% in 1954. Mayfield said the retailer was grappling with structural change in the retail market as sales transferred from its stores to the internet. Although sales via John Lewis's website surged more than 26%, takings at all its department stores barring Peter Jones in London's upmarket Sloane Square were down. \"Profound changes are taking place in the retail sector and importantly this was a year when we upped the pace of innovation and investment,\" he said. \"That came at the price of some short-term profit but leaves us in a good place at the start of this year.\" Consumer spending had also been reset on a \"different trajectory\", he added, with no expectation of a return to the retail boom that preceded the credit crunch. Spend, spend, spend The partnership's annual results are a red letter day for staff and there were no grumbles among the 800 John Lewis workers at its newest branch, in the Westfield Stratford City shopping centre that backs on to the Olympic Park in east London. The figure was met with clapping and whoops of joy as exotic summer holidays and shopping sprees were brought within reach. John Lewis partner Adam Richardson said: \"A bonus is a bonus. I'm not disappointed in the slightest as we can see that other retailers are struggling.\" Wendy O'Mahoney, who was unemployed for four years before getting a job at the centre's Waitrose branch when it opened last year, said: \"It's more than I expected, I am really happy, it's my first bonus so I am really chuffed. I am going to spend, spend, spend.\" John Lewis managing director Andy Street said the department store's \"never knowingly undersold\" pledge, which sees it match rivals' promotions, had cost it almost \u00a324m during the year and was a major factor behind its weak financial performance, with profits down \u00a340.5m to \u00a3157.9m on sales of \u00a33.3bn in the year to 28 January. Its larger sister chain Waitrose, with annual sales of more than \u00a35bn, fared better although profits still fell 5% at \u00a3260.6m. The decline was blamed on heavy investment in 29 new branches as well as a so-called \"dark store\" in London that is not open to the public but instead used to pick internet orders. Its market share edged up 0.2% to 4.1% during the year with the grocer, aided by successful tie-ups with Delia Smith and Heston Blumenthal, ringing up an extra 400,000 transactions a week. After a grim 2011 Mayfield was \"cautiously optimistic\" the trading environment would pick up this year as events such as the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the London Olympics buoyed the spirits of consumers. In the five weeks since the end of the reporting period both chains had enjoyed like-for-like sales of more than 2%.",

      "bodyText": "Germany's biggest selling newspaper, Bild, has said \"nein\" to the Greek debt swap \u2013 three months after buying \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,350) of Greek government bonds. \"The Greek debt writedown is coming to private (small) investors. Also to Bild,\" the tabloid said. \"But we say 'NO'.\" Bild argues that the proposed deal \"on its own will not help Greece back on its feet\". \"A debt writedown without Greece's exit from the eurozone does not address the question how the Greek economy can ever pick up again and create new jobs,\" it said. The newspaper, which has 12 million readers in Germany, bought \u20ac10,000 of Greek debt at a heavily discounted price of \u20ac4,815 in the secondary bond market in December. The bonds mature on 20 March, and Bild was expecting to pocket the full nominal value of \u20ac10,000. But under an agreement between Athens and its main creditors, bondholders are being asked to take a writedown, or \"haircut,\" of at least 70%. The restructuring is set to reduce Greece's debt burden by more than \u20ac100bn and is crucial to prevent a messy default, which would send shockwaves through financial markets. The value of Bild's bonds will be slashed to just \u20ac3,000 under the deal. Even with the huge discount it got when it paid for the bonds, the newspaper will still suffer a 38% loss on its holdings. The bond swap has been accepted by a long list of European banks, including Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Athens has passed legislation to force reluctant bondholders to participate if two thirds agree to the deal. Banks, insurers and investment funds holding debt issued under Greek law must decide by 8pm GMT on Thursday, while those who hold Greek bonds issued under foreign law have until 11 April to make up their minds. Bild dismissed the debt swap as a \"sham\", arguing that many of the economic scenarios on which the deal was based were \"unrealistic\". It also noted that after the snap Greek election in April, the country's new government may not stick to the drastic reforms required under the terms of the new bailout package. Last week Bild urged the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, to reject the second bailout for Greece that is tied to the debt restructuring. The paper did add a PS: \"If Bild should after all make a profit with the bonds it will be donated to a good cause.\"",

The insurer's chief executive Henry Engelhardt quoted the novelist's famous opening sentence from A Tale of Two Cities: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness ...\" \"How did Mr Dickens know, nearly 200 years ago, that his words could be used to describe Admiral's 2011 year?\" Engelhardt asked. \"It has been a disappointing year. Not because it was a bad year, but because so much more was expected.\" The company, which insures more than one in 10 cars on Britain's roads, made a profit before tax of \u00a3299m last year, up 13% from 2010. This was better than the \u00a3289m pencilled in by City analysts. Analysts had initially forecast a 22% profit rise but were forced to slash their estimates in November when Admiral warned it had been hit by a surge in personal injury claims. Injury claims dropped in the second half of the year, in a sign that Britain's \"whiplash epidemic\" is easing, at least for the moment. Admiral shares closed up 10% at \u00a311.44. The UK's second-largest car insurer after RBSI (recently rebranded as Direct Line), with 2.9m customers, said a combination of mild winter weather, higher policy excesses, rising petrol prices and lower disposable incomes which discouraged people from driving had led to a 10% fall in claims across the industry. \"This helped slow the relentless rise in the cost of bodily injury claims in the UK market,\" said Admiral's chief operating officer David Stevens, as well as tempering insurers' appetite for price increases. He said the middle of the year marked the point when the dramatic premium inflation that kicked off in late 2009 ground to a halt. Admiral's premiums rose 12% last year, following a 16% increase in 2010. Car insurance premiums have been rising to cover mounting costs from the surge in whiplash claims in recent years. Bosses from the UK's biggest insurers, including Admiral, recently met David Cameron to discuss action against the whiplash epidemic. Over the last three years, the number of whiplash claims has jumped by 32% to 570,000 a year, even though the number of accidents reported has dropped by 16% to less than 210,000. Engelhardt finished his comments with another Dickens quote, this time from Oliver Twist. \"For the eighth consecutive year, in fact every year since we became a public company, Admiral has reported record turnover and record profits with a return on capital of 59%. If this is, as Dickens put it, the winter of despair, then I say: Please, Sir, may I have some more?\" Admiral is paying shareholders a total dividend of 75.6p for the year, up 11% from 2010. Its 5,500 staff will receive free shares worth \u00a33,000 each under the employee share scheme, the same as in 2010. Oriel Securities analyst Marcus Barnard said: \"We see a group which is sensibly slowing the growth rate and increasing premium rates, while tackling the emergence of bodily injury claims. This is much as we suggested they do in our September note.\" Wise words from the boardroom The Admiral boss is not the only one to wax lyrical in the annual results statement. Bloomsbury Publishing chairman Jeremy Wilson quoted Charles Darwin in the 2011 annual report: \"'It is not the strongest of the species, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change.' Bloomsbury is undergoing one of the most significant periods of adaptation in its 25-year history.\" Others are more into popular culture. Having unveiled a \u00a3237m loss in mid-2008, Brixton Estates boss Tim Wheeler felt the urge to provide his own cover version of Bob Dylan's All Along the Watchtower. The property firm's quarterly results quoted the lyrics: \"There must be some way out of here / Said the joker to the thief / There's too much confusion / I can't get no relief.\" Wheeler explained the jokers and thieves referred to \"opportunist buyers\" and \"owners who won't sell\". And \"I can't get no relief\" translated into \"the imposition of empty rates which imposed a further financial burden on commercial property\". Another classic is this quote from veteran investor Warren Buffett: \"You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out\" - his 2001 warning that the good times would not last forever. Robert Hiscox, who will bow out as chairman of the eponymous UK insurer next year, always rambled about being tested by \"Mother Nature\" and did not mince his words when he spotted signs of \"foolish underwriting\". But when it comes to chairman ramblings, Andrew Perloff, of UK property investment firm Panther Securities, is hard to beat. Luckily he provided some kind of explanation to those struggling to follow his thoughts: \"As always, my ramblings are little convoluted and it may be hard for readers to understand the connection between my thoughts on BP PLC, the bankers, George Best and our Afghan tenant, of course I will explain. In every case the wrong person/people have been attacked.\"",

      "bodyText": "Europe's second largest car maker, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, has added weight to the industry's call for European Union help in tackling the continent's manufacturing capacity problem. Excess factory space has become a dominant topic of discussion at the Geneva Motor Show, as executives discuss how to cut back on plants that, according to analysts, produce at least 1m more cars than the European market needs every year. Philippe Varin, PSA's chief executive and former boss of steelmaker Corus, said Brussels could draw lessons from historic interventions in the steel sector. \"We have experience in the past \u2026 the example of the steel industry where it [overcapacity] was a problem, it was addressed at the EU level and it was addressed very efficiently. So why don't we draw some lessons from the past. It would be very useful.\" However, Varin said there had to be \"willingness\" among EU officials to intervene. Varin's comments follow a call for political intervention from the European car industry association, the ACEA. Speaking at Geneva this week, the ACEA's general secretary, Ivan Hodac, said: \"We cannot continue endlessly deal with automotive issues at the national level.\" He added: \"We need an EU-wide solution. But it is not easy.\" The chief executive of Fiat, Sergio Marchionne, said a \"structural fix\" needed to be \"managed and addressed by the European Union as the holder and repository of the notion of the single market.\" Analysts have raised the possibility of the EU relaxing rules to make the firing of workers cheaper, but European car makers have yet to reveal what shape their apeals for assistance might take. GM, maker of the Vauxhall and Opel brands in Europe, has found itself at the centre of the restructuring story amid concerted lobbying by the UK government and trade unions to keep the UK's Ellesmere Port plant open and preserve 2,800 jobs. Last month PSA signed a worldwide alliance with GM that saw the US car group take a 7% stake in its French competitor. Sources close to the discussions over Ellesmere Port believe that GM will outline further details on its capacity plans, which could clarify the future for Ellesmere Port, at an executive gathering on 28 March. Speaking at a press briefing in Geneva on Wednesday, Varin said the GM alliance would have no bearing on restructuring capacity at both car makers. However, Varin said the PSA and GM could share production facilities in five years' time after they agreed to develop vehicles together as part of the alliance. \"This is one option which is open for the long-term.\" He added: \"We can make Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn cars, so you can imagine that we can do that in the future with some GM models.\" Varin's comments could alarm Ellesmere Port's supporters, who are concerned that the plant will be squeezed out by GM and are keen to know the car maker's production plans beyond 2014. GM has pledged to uphold a labour agreement that prohibits plant closures at its European operations before 2014. Employees at Ellesmere Port, where Astra cars are made, want to secure the production of new GM models that will provide some form of assurance about the plant's future. Ellesmere Port's backers believe those plans could become clearer on 28 March if GM produces an outline business plan for 2012 to 2016.",

      "bodyText": "Talk of stakebuilding in J Sainsbury usually revolves around the Qataris, failed bidders in 2007 despite offering 600p a share. The Qataris still own nearly 26%, and there is regular speculation they might want to take another tilt at the supermarket at some stage. But on Wednesday came news of stakebuilding from a different source. M1 Capital has recently bought enough shares to take its stake to 3.02% of Sainsbury, the company revealed. M1 is a vehicle for brothers Taha and Najib Miktai, the latter of whom has twice served as prime minister of Lebanon.

      "body": "<p><strong>Kingfisher</strong>, which owns B&amp;Q in the UK and Castorama in France, is in demand after results from a continental rival and an upgrade from Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>French group Mr Bricolage said on Tuesday that it expected a slight increase in like for like sales in 2012, and this is proving helpful for Kingfisher. Analysts at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> [The comments are] positive for Kingfisher as concern about the macro environment in France has been growing and led to fears that consensus forecasts are too optimistic; we forecast a flat like for like in France for the comparable year. We would expect Kingfisher to outperform Mr Bricolage given that it has been performing ahead of the market over the last 18 months and has better stock availability \u2013 Mr Bricolage has struggled with new laws that have improved supplier terms whilst Kingfisher's stronger balance sheet is better able to cope. Aside from this relatively positive top-line outlook, Kingfisher also has the benefits of its direct sourcing/common ranging/own label programs that should see further gross margin gains. Kingfisher is one of our top picks in the sector. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Geoff Ruddell at Morgan Stanley has moved his recommendation on Kingfisher from equalweight to overweight, and raised his price target from 285p to 325p. He said the bank had met around 100 investors in the company in the past few weeks, and there were only two debates that really mattered:</p> <blockquote> 1) Will its sourcing plans work?

      "bodyText": "Kingfisher, which owns B&amp;Q in the UK and Castorama in France, is in demand after results from a continental rival and an upgrade from Morgan Stanley. French group Mr Bricolage said on Tuesday that it expected a slight increase in like for like sales in 2012, and this is proving helpful for Kingfisher. Analysts at Espirito Santo said: [The comments are] positive for Kingfisher as concern about the macro environment in France has been growing and led to fears that consensus forecasts are too optimistic; we forecast a flat like for like in France for the comparable year. We would expect Kingfisher to outperform Mr Bricolage given that it has been performing ahead of the market over the last 18 months and has better stock availability \u2013 Mr Bricolage has struggled with new laws that have improved supplier terms whilst Kingfisher's stronger balance sheet is better able to cope. Aside from this relatively positive top-line outlook, Kingfisher also has the benefits of its direct sourcing/common ranging/own label programs that should see further gross margin gains. Kingfisher is one of our top picks in the sector. Meanwhile Geoff Ruddell at Morgan Stanley has moved his recommendation on Kingfisher from equalweight to overweight, and raised his price target from 285p to 325p. He said the bank had met around 100 investors in the company in the past few weeks, and there were only two debates that really mattered: 1) Will its sourcing plans work? Kingfisher is unlikely to grow sales by more than 4% per annum in the next three years, so to hit its LTIP targets management will need to increase EBIT margins by a further 140 basis points. The key to this are its sourcing plans. We are increasingly confident that they will work (this time). 2) Will the French consumer 'crack'?

The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported a dip in business spending from record highs and a slowdown in household spending.

The government sought to stress that Australia's growth still significantly outstripped that in other developed economies in the fourth quarter, when the UK contracted 0.2% and the eurozone shrank 0.3%. Australian treasurer Wayne Swan said the country was not immune to outside pressures as the eurozone sovereign debt crisis persists. \"Despite our underlying strengths, we always said that global instability would impact our economy, and these headwinds have added to existing pressures from the sustained high dollar and the cautious consumer,\" he said. But he echoed the country's central bank in predicting more solid growth for the year ahead. \"Our low unemployment, sturdy public finances, very low debt, contained inflation, and huge pipeline of investment provide a solid foundation that will help us withstand global turbulence,\" Swan added. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) expects growth of between 3% and 3.5% this year as Australia's resource-rich economy benefits from strong demand from China. The RBA held interest rates steady at 4.25% earlier this week but analysts and financial markets have now scaled up expectations of a cut in coming months.

      "bodyText": "UK consumer spending edged up for the second month running in February, according to new figures fanning hopes that the economy enjoyed a modest bounce at the start of the year. Helping to allay fears that the UK had slipped back into recession, payment company Visa Europe said on Wednesday that consumer spending rose 0.2% on the month, adding to January's 0.2% uptick. Visa, which said transactions on its cards accounted for \u00a31 in every \u00a33 of UK spending, cautioned however that spending was down 1.3% on a less volatile three-month on three-month basis. On the year to the end of February, spending fell 1.7%. Steve Perry, commercial director of Visa Europe, said: \"February saw the first consecutive month-on-month increase in consumer spending since last July ... further bolstering confidence that the economy may be slowly returning to growth. \"However, the underlining trend revealed by the three-month on three-month data remains subdued, suggesting that we still have a way to go before we can talk of a full recovery.\" Behind the headline numbers was further evidence that people are increasingly turning to the internet to find bargains. Online spending rose 4.4%. There were also signs of higher spending on more discretionary items, with clothing and footwear up 7.4% and hotels and restaurants up 6.9%. A separate report suggests retailers are still struggling to raise prices against a backdrop of weak consumer confidence. Shop price inflation slowed to just 1.2% in February according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). The slowdown came as the non-food category turned deflationary for the first time in more than two years. Prices were down 0.7% on the BRC-Nielsen shop price index. BRC head Stephen Robertson said: \"While fuel and utility bills are eating up an ever bigger proportion of household budgets, many goods sold by retailers now cost less than they did a year ago.
