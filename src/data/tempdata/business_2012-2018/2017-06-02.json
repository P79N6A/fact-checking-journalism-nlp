      "bodyText": "Talks between Royal Bank of Scotland and a group of \u201cdiehard\u201d shareholders suing the lender have collapsed after a bad-tempered summit ended in an impasse that could force the bank\u2019s former boss Fred Goodwin into the dock. Three directors of the RBoS Shareholder Action Group met chief executive Ross McEwan on Friday morning at the lender\u2019s headquarters on Bishopsgate in the City of London. They are understood to have asked McEwan to improve on his 82p-per-share settlement offer, which would add about \u00a3200m to the \u00a3700m compensation bill already agreed with a majority of shareholders. Two people with knowledge of the meeting said discussions became heated, with McEwan accusing the group of turning RBS into the \u201cMillwall of British banking\u201d, believed to be a reference to the south London football club\u2019s public image. Sources close to RBS have categorically denied that McEwan said this. The claimants were represented at the talks by the lawyers Jonathan Gaunt, Nigel Masters and Lorena Aguirre, who have been assisting former RBS shareholders with their pursuit of the bank. McEwan told the trio that he was not prepared to increase the existing offer, an 11th-hour olive branch offered last month as a 14-week trial loomed. The opposing legal teams have now exchanged skeleton arguments, indicating that both sides believe the trial now has a good chance of going ahead. Claimants willing to accept the offer include the pension funds and financial institutions that make up around 80% of the shareholders, who funded a \u00a312bn cash call by RBS in 2008. Trevor Hemmings, the owner of Preston North End football club, who has been funding the \u201cdiehard\u201d lawsuit, is another who has accepted RBS\u2019s offer. RBS only needs to secure approval from shareholders representing 70% of the value of the total claim for the settlement to go ahead, but wanted to get broader agreement to head off further disputes. Some diehard group members are understood to be angry at a bespoke deal offered to Hemmings by RBS that would make his settlement contingent on ceasing to pay fellow claimants\u2019 legal bills. While they are determined to force Goodwin into court, the defiant group would have to raise their own funds to take the case to trial. They have raised \u00a34m of the \u00a37m required and are confident of securing the remaining funds in time to start the trial on Wednesday next week. \u201cWe will go to the wire,\u201d a source close to this group said. The source added that even an increased offer might not be enough, with some investors unwilling to accept anything less than seeing Goodwin explain his stewardship of the bank. The case concerns an attempt by RBS in April 2008 to raise \u00a312bn through a rights issue as it tried to raise funds to repair its ailing balance sheet amid a snowballing global banking crisis. The claimants allege that directors, including Goodwin and former chairman Sir Tom McKillop, gave a false impression that the bank could be restored to good health. Some of the claimants, who include 9,000 retail investors, say they were even encouraged by the bank\u2019s bosses to borrow money to buy more shares. Just a few months later, amid the turmoil triggered by the collapse of Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers, the government launched a taxpayer-funded bailout of the bank that ended up costing \u00a345.5bn. Those who invested in the rights issue at \u00a32 per share saw around 80% of their investment wiped out and the majority of the bank is still owned by the state. Goodwin, who was stripped of his knighthood in the wake of the bank\u2019s collapse, has never given an account of his conduct, and the trial has been seen as the last chance for a public airing of the bank\u2019s near-collapse. The judge in the ongoing legal dispute, Mr Justice Hildyard, has already adjourned it three times to make time for settlement talks. Separate groups of investors, representing the majority of initial claimants, have already accepted offers at 41p a share and 43.2p a share, with the bank putting aside \u00a3800m last December to resolve claims. These settlements have cost RBS about \u00a3700m so far, meaning it would have to reserve another \u00a3100m if the remaining claimants decide to take up the offer rather than pursue their case.",

      "bodyText": "Construction work on a $7.9bn project to develop a sprawling coastal Olympics complex and Athens\u2019s former airport will begin in six months, the Greek government has said. State minister Alekos Flabouraris said on Friday that the leftist administration\u2019s privatisation agency had given the go-ahead to a consortium of Abu Dhabi and Chinese investors backed by the Chinese conglomerate Fosun, which owns 12% of the British holiday company Thomas Cook, to turn the site into a major resort. It had been earmarked as a metropolitan park but was largely abandoned for the past decade. Now the consortium plans to build a 200-hectare (494-acre) park along with apartments, hotels and shopping malls at the site, which also includes some venues from the 2004 Olympics. Greece committed to sell off state assets under the terms of the international bailout keeping its economy afloat since 2010. Its main private property developer, Lamda, signed a deal in 2014 to build on the Hellenikon coastal area, in one of Europe\u2019s biggest real estate development projects. The announcement came as Greece\u2019s statistics service, Elstat, said the economy expanded in the first three months of 2017, upwardly revising a previous flash estimate in May that showed a 0.1% quarterly contraction. Data showed the economy grew by 0.4% in January to March compared with the final quarter of 2016 when gross domestic product contracted by 1.1%. \u201c\u03a4he readings are better as we had more accurate estimates in the time that has intervened after the flash projections,\u201d said a senior official at Elstat. Greece is pinning its hopes on a resurgence of tourists who had been deterred by the migrant crisis and the camps that sprung up along the coast and on its much-visited islands. The consortium will pay \u20ac915m (\u00a3800m) to lease the site. It had hoped to start work by June but the project has been delayed because of various bureaucratic hurdles. Greek forestry authorities said last month, for example, that the site includes some land that is classified as forest, a decision that Greece has said it will challenge. Before securing any building permits, it will also need the country\u2019s archaeological authorities to say whether the site includes protected antiquities. Under a deal with its EU/IMF lenders, Athens needs to speed up the Hellenikon investment and address any forestry and archaeological issues.",

Walmart, which employes about 1.5 million workers in its 4,700 US stores, said it \u201cjust makes sense\u201d for them to deliver packages on the way home as 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of one of its stores. Marc Lore, Walmart\u2019s head of e-commerce operations, said the scheme would cut shipping costs, increase speed of delivery and allow workers to earn extra cash. \u201cIt just makes sense: We already have trucks moving orders from fulfilment centres to stores for pickup,\u201d he said in a blog post. \u201cThose same trucks could be used to bring ship-to-home orders to a store close to their final destination \u2026 Imagine all the routes our associates drive to and from work and the houses they pass along the way. It\u2019s easy to see why this test could be a gamechanger.\u201d The company has been testing the new delivery process with workers at three stores for the past month, but did not offer details about where or when the plan would be expanded across the US. The \u201clast mile\u201d of deliveries, when packages are driven to customers\u2019 homes, are often most expensive part of the online delivery process and a challenge that many supermarkets and delivery companies are trying to solve. Tesco is attempting to use robots to delivery groceries in the UK. Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket this week announced it had successfully used a six-wheeled buggy to deliver food from stores to homes in some parts of central London. The company said it planned to widen the pilot scheme in partnership with Starship Technologies, who make the robots that have also been used by takeaway company Just Eat. The robots will be able to carry items within a three-mile radius. Amazon has also been testing drones for deliveries in the UK. In the US, Walmart has been struggling to keep up with Amazon\u2019s fast deliveries, which have tempted some shoppers to switch from travelling to the supermarket to having their goods delivered via Amazon Prime, which offers next-day delivery in more than 5,000 US cities. Lore has been spearheading Walmart\u2019s drive to catch up, since the Arkansas-based retailer bought his Jet.com online delivery firm for $3.3bn last year. At the time, Walmart said the purchase of Jet was \u201canother jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart\u201d. Lore, Jet\u2019s founder and chief executive, became Walmart\u2019s president of e-commerce as part of the deal. The delivery trial is voluntary for store workers, who can sign up for a maximum of 10 deliveries a day. The retailer did not share details on pay for those deliveries. The test is limited to three stores in New Jersey and Arkansas. The announcement came ahead of Walmart\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Friday. Walmart, which owns Asda in the UK, is the world\u2019s largest retailer and made $486bn revenue last year, compared with Amazon\u2019s $136bn. But Walmart has made little inroads online, while Amazon accounts for about a third of all online orders.",

      "bodyText": "Cabin crew at British Airways have announced they will hold a four-day strike later this month, compounding the problems for the beleaguered airline which stranded 75,000 passengers at the weekend after an IT meltdown. Unite members of the mixed fleet, set up in 2011 on inferior pay and conditions, will walk out from 16 June in a dispute over \u201cpoverty pay\u201d at the airline. A proposed deal was reached in May, but one which included sanctions against crew who had been on strike and deprived low-paid staff of travel perks. BA has said during previous strikes that it ensured all passengers reached their destination, through merging flights and hiring other carriers to operate planes on their behalf. The strike is unlikely to cause anything near the disruption of the power outage that saw the airline cancel over 800 flights at the start of the bank holiday weekend. The airline is continuing to investigate the cause, with reports suggesting a maintenance worker had inadvertently switched off the power supply. But CBRE, the contractor which manages the facilities at BA\u2019s ageing Boadicea House data centre near Heathrow, said claims that the cause had been determined were \u201cnot founded in fact\u201d. CBRE, a global firm whose services include maintaining mechanical and electrical services for data centres, said: \u201cWe are the manager of the facility for our client BA and fully support its investigation. No determination has been made yet regarding the cause of this incident. Any speculation to the contrary is not founded in fact.\u201d BA said its investigation was ongoing and the cause had not been determined. In an internal email to staff, Bill Francis, the head of IT for BA\u2019s parent company, IAG, said an uninterruptible power supply to a core data centre at Heathrow was over-ridden. He said: \u201cThis resulted in the total immediate loss of power to the facility, bypassing the backup generators and batteries \u2026 After a few minutes of this shutdown of power, it was turned back on in an unplanned and uncontrolled fashion, which created physical damage to the system, and significantly exacerbated the problem.\u201d Francis told investors in 2015 that he would find savings of about \u20ac90m (\u00a378m) per year from outsourcing IT operations, which followed the cuts in pay and conditions for BA\u2019s cabin crew he had overseen in 2011. The GMB union said IT outsourcing had contributed to the failure, and demanded to take part in an external inquiry. Mick Rix, GMB national officer for aviation, said the union wanted to \u201censure that the information and views from our skilled IT members on the front line is properly put forward, and taken on board by BA IAG.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is counter-intuitive to think that sending vital IT and other business functions thousands of miles will not affect the resilience of the BA IAG operation.\u201d Many IT roles are now outsourced to Tata Consulting Services. However, a TCS spokesperson said: \u201cAs BA has already confirmed, the problems were caused by a power supply issue and were in no way related to TCS. While TCS was not responsible for this issue, our staff have worked alongside BA and their partners to restore services as quickly as possible.\u201d The power shutdown knocked out the airline\u2019s computer systems, but experts have questioned why any company would not have a functioning uninterruptible power supply and failsafe backups. BA had to cancel all flights from London\u2019s Heathrow and Gatwick airports last Saturday, leaving 75,000 passengers stranded. It blamed a power surge that knocked out its computer system, disrupting flight operations, call centres and its website. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of IAG, on Thursday praised BA bosses for \u201cdoing everything possible\u201d after the IT meltdown. Walsh\u2019s comments came amid reports that the BA board is demanding an external inquiry into the fiasco, which is expected to land the airline with a \u00a3100m-plus compensation bill. He said the investigation would take time but insisted that BA\u2019s management, led by chief executive, Alex Cruz, \u201cdid everything they could in the circumstances\u201d. The airline has been criticised for not promising full compensation to all those affected, but Walsh said: \u201cOur focus will be on making sure that any of our customers who experienced disruption are satisfied with how we handled things. Clearly we will do everything we can to make up for the disruption that they suffered.\u201d Customers have been further angered by BA\u2019s online claim forms, which instruct them to first seek compensation via their travel insurance \u2013 leaving many liable to pay an excess. The Association of British Insurers has complained to the airline that it is giving misleading information and that BA should be the first point of call. BA said it now had amended its website. The level of compensation the airline intends to provide will be of intense interest to customers who are still waiting for their bags to be returned, even though they were unable to fly.",

      "bodyText": "Global stock markets reached new peaks on Friday, but came off their best levels following disappointing US jobs data. Only 138,000 jobs were created across the US in May, well below the expected level of 180,000. March and April\u2019s figures were revised down by 66,000. The jobs figures came a day after upbeat manufacturing surveys from the UK, Europe and US, which helped outweigh concerns about the UK election and Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate deal. The UK outlook was also boosted on Friday by better-than-expected construction figures, with the Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers\u2019 index climbing from 53.1 to 56 in May, compared with a forecasted fall to 52.7. The FTSE 100 recorded a new closing high of 7,547, up only slightly after a flurry of buying earlier in the day pushed the intraday peak to 7,598.99. The FTSE 250 also suffered a rollercoaster ride after initially hitting a new record of 20,081 before ending the day at down slightly at 19,977. Investors shrugged off continuing weakness in the pound as the Conservative lead over Labour continued to narrow in the latest opinion polls. But the FTSE 100 underperformed compared with its European counterparts, thanks to a slide in the oil price hitting commodity companies. Crude dropped more than 3% in the wake of Trump\u2019s climate decision to below $49 a barrel for Brent crude, which analysts said could prompt US drillers to increase their output. This would outweigh the moves by Opec and its allies to cut production and would put more downward pressure on prices. The German Dax climbed 158 points to 12,822 while the French CAC edged 24 points higher to 5,343, and the MSCI All-Country World index rose 0.3% to a record high. Meanwhile, the US Dow Industrial Index moved higher in early trading, up 33 points to a fresh high of 21,213. Analysts at Capital Economics said the modest increase in US jobs was \u201cnot too discouraging\u201d and was likely to pick up again over the rest of the summer. It said: \u201cAfter all, the employment rate declined to 4.3% in May, its lowest level since 2001. With survey evidence suggesting it will fall below 4% in the next few months, and wage growth likely to pick up before long, we expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates steadily over the next year and a half.\u201d The US central bank has indicated that it will increase interest rates for a fourth time by 0.25% after taking rates to near zero in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash. It has taken a cautious approach to increasing rates after the turmoil in global markets triggered in 2014 by hints from Fed bosses that higher long-term interest rates were likely. A hike could come as soon as a fortnight when Fed boss Janet Yellen and members of the Federal Open Market Committee next meet in Washington. In March the Fed pushed US base rates to 1%, well above the 0.25% set by the Bank of England. With only a week to go before the UK election and three weeks before the start of Brexit negotiations, Capital Economics said the FTSE 100 and UK economy were in for a bumpy ride. \u201cThursday\u2019s general election will command the majority of attention this coming week. With the recent narrowing in the polls and major differences between the main parties both on Brexit and the stance and mix of fiscal policy, the outcome could have a rather greater impact on the economy and markets than the last few elections have done.\u201d Kully Samra, managing director at the stockbroker Charles Schwab, said the weaker than expected US jobs report was \u201cmerely a temporary blip on the radar\u201d. He said: \u201cWider US economic data remains buoyant and equity markets resilient, even in the face of the potential turmoil coming out of Washington. Underlying numbers are still robust which should help solidify June rate hike expectations.\u201d Marc Ostwald, a strategist at ADM Investor Services, said one of the risks to a calm week ahead of the Fed meeting was the appearance of former FBI boss James Comey before a congressional committee on Thursday. He said the UK election outcome and a wide range of economic data from China would also influence investor confidence.",

    "webTitle": "US jobs figures come in well below expectations, knocking markets off highs - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The big event of the day, the US jobs data, turned into a disappointment. After expectations that at least 180,000 jobs would be added in May the actual figure came out at 138,000. March and April\u2019s figures were also revised downwards by 66,000. But most analysts believe the poor data would not stop the US Federal Reserve from raising interest rates at its meeting later this month. Earlier, a UK construction survey proved stronger than expected, lifted by a strong residential sector. Greece saw its first quarter growth figures revised upwards, meaning it did not fall into recession and is outperforming the UK, Italy and the US. On that note, it\u2019s time to close. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. The poor US jobs figures have certainly taken the shine off markets. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently just 9 points higher, well below the earlier expectations. The S&amp;P 500 opened virtually unchanged while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.24%. European markets are also off their best levels, with the FTSE 100 now up just 0.15% although still on track - just - for a new closing high. Germany\u2019s Dax is 1.3% better while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.5%. Still with the US jobs and here\u2019s a breakdown of the job movements in various sectors: Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: As far as today\u2019s NFP number matters, a June rate hike is pretty well nailed on and today\u2019s relatively soft nonfarm payrolls number shouldn\u2019t really affect the FOMC\u2019s decision-making in the near-term. We know the Fed is more than happy to look through this kind of thing. Indeed Janet Yellen isn\u2019t that fussed about one quarter of weaker growth, so she\u2019s hardly going to be troubled by a soft-ish month or two of job creation. The recent US data has been pretty solid too and projections for Q2 growth are very upbeat \u2013 the Atlanta Fed reckons 4%, which would make a soft month or two of job creation pretty irrelevant. The big question is not really whether we get a hike in June now but the extent to which the market thinks the Fed is ready to do one or even two more hikes this year. Today\u2019s jobs numbers arguably make the Fed a touch less likely to tighten as quickly as the most hawkish estimates suggest. Here\u2019s more from ING Bank. Economist James Smith said: Today\u2019s US jobs report would have had to be horrendous to worry the Fed, and the sub-consensus wage and jobs numbers won\u2019t derail a June rate hike. To us, the latest dip in non-farm payrolls to 138k looks like nothing more than a return closer to the underlying trend. As the US economy is close to, if not at, full employment, we should be seeing a gradual slowdown in jobs growth. Whilst 200k+ jobs growth sounds good at face value, consistently high readings would raise the possibility that there is more slack in the US economy than previously thought. This is a view that the Fed themselves broadly subscribe to, and they won\u2019t be phased by today\u2019s sub-consensus figure. What they may find more irritating is wage growth, which marginally disappointed markets by coming in at 2.5% year on year. In reality, this is probably more of a statistical quirk rather than anything fundamental. May had three more workdays than April, and as the data doesn\u2019t adjust for this, average hourly earnings will have been temporarily depressed. The underlying story is still a positive one. Labour market tightness still appears to be pushing up pay, but the Fed really needs to see average hourly earnings growth push above 3% if they are to hike more aggressively. And that\u2019s looking increasingly unlikely this year. So what does this all mean for the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle? Well in reality, it would have taken a horrendous report today to make the Fed think twice about a June rate hike. Other recent data has supported the notion that 1Q economic weakness was \u201ctransitory\u201d. But what comes next from the Fed is less assured. Core PCE has struggled to converge on 2%, wage growth has been disappointing and Trump\u2019s fiscal plans are still very uncertain. That means we don\u2019t expect fireworks from the Fed, but even so, we feel a third 2017 rate hike in September still looks more likely than markets are currently pricing. But the poor data may not stop an imminent US rate rise: The weaker than expected non-farm payroll numbers came as a particular surprise since on Thursday the ADP private sector jobs report beat forecasts, prompting analysts to expect a higher number if anything. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: The significant dip in nonfarm payrolls for May will be a concern for Donald Trump, particularly as the figure has slipped below the 150,000 generally considered as a marker of strong job creation. The embattled president has been under attack from all sides in recent weeks, but had at least been able to point to the strong performance of the US economy since his inauguration. However, a failure to deliver on jobs will leave him vulnerable, particularly as he made it the cornerstone of his successful run to the White House. The question now is how the Federal Reserve reacts, with many analysts expecting policy makers to hesitate on future rate hikes if wage growth does not pick up pace. It was seen as a given that the US Federal Reserve would be raising interest rates at its meeting in the middle of the month. But these poor jobs figures cast some doubt on that, and on any further moves by the Fed. So the dollar has weakened, dropping to a seven month low against the Swiss franc and the euro. The pound has strengthened as a consequence, and is now up 0.07% at $1.2888 having earlier fallen as low as $1.2846. The US futures have also come off their best, now indicating a smaller opening rise of around 49 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The unemployment rate dipped from 4.4% in April to 4.3% last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile the US trade deficit widened by more than expected in April. It jumped 5.2% to $47.6bn, the highest level since January, with a surge in cellphone imports. Average hourly earnings were up 0.2% in May, the same as the April figure which was itself revised down from 0.3%. Breaking news: Bad news for Donald Trump. The US non-farm payroll numbers have come in well below expectations. They fell from 174,000 in April to 138,000, compared to expectations of a figure of at least 180,000. And that April figure itself was revised down from 211,000. March was revised down from 79,000 to 50,000, meaning in total, around 108,000 fewer jobs were created than expected. Back with Greece, and following the news that the country has avoided recession, the Greek prime minister\u2019s mentor and closest advisor Alekos Fambouraris has made a rare public statement. Helena Smith reports: Fambouraris said the government\u2019s goal now was to close the outstanding bailout review so that disbursement of the \u20ac7.5bn Athens owes in imminent maturing debt is made. \u201c[It] will give a boost to the real economy because besides covering our obligations towards creditors the rest of the money will cover requirements of the real economy,\u201d he said. Senior sources in Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led administration say they are bracing for a tough eurogroup meeting on June 15 amid growing signals from senior European officials that the prospect of any debt deal is now off the table. Flambouraris insisted Athens was still holding out for an agreement. \u201cCaught in the row between the IMF and German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble, the government is trying to achieve a solution for the debt that will make it viable,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cWe know very well that this clash does not help our country but despite that we are still trying and hoping.\u201d With just over an hour to go to the latest US non farm payroll figures, there is continuing talk the number could beat forecasts, especially in the light of Thursday\u2019s private sector data from ADP. Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, said: The ADP data released yesterday (which only covers the (private sector) clients of payrolls processing firm ADP) came in at 253,000 jobs versus 180,000 expected) and this has set the stage for a strong number today. Economists expect the US to add 184,000 nonfarm jobs (211,000 in April) though the \u201cwhisper number\u201d is somewhat higher. The unemployment rate is forecast to hold steady at 4.4%, a level which is effectively full employment. The wage inflation number indicator will be highly watched as wage growth has been slower than expected despite labour market tightness. This has been reflected in recent Fed officials\u2019 utterances about undershooting the inflation target of 2%. A strong number will only strengthen the already very strong conviction that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by 25 basis points at their mid-June meeting. While European markets are soaring, the FTSE 100 has come off its best levels, with commodity companies coming under pressure as the oil price falls. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The FTSE lost its mojo as the morning went on, significantly trailing beyond its rampant Eurozone peers. After striking [almost] 7600 for the first time in its history the UK index quickly fell back, and is now up just 15 points thanks to a series of sharp losses in its commodity sector. Following on from yesterday\u2019s late drop \u2013 inspired by reports of increased oil output in Libya and the US \u2013 Brent Crude has fallen a further 2.5%, leaving the black stuff just above $49 per barrel. That\u2019s because Trump\u2019s decision to remove America from the Paris climate agreement has sparked concerns that the country will ramp up its drilling, negating any output cap implemented by OPEC. This in turn sent Shell and BP down 0.5% to 1%, with the miners also in the red thanks to copper\u2019s 1.7% decline. Free from such troubles the Eurozone soared this Friday, the CAC and DAX jumping 0.8% and 1.4% respectively. The Dow Jones is set to break its own records when the bell rings on Wall Street, with the futures suggesting the index will cross the 21200 mark. That\u2019s because investors are getting excited about this afternoon\u2019s non-farm jobs report. A huge ADP non-farm figure means the current forecasts for a 181k change in the number of employed people may be conservative, while for the past 2 months in a row the unemployment rate has unexpectedly shrank. Wage growth is the only real laggard, with average hourly earnings set to fall from 0.3% to 0.2% month-on-month. Germany\u2019s Dax has joined the global rally and also reached a new peak. It has added more than 1.4% to hit 12,850, beating the previous high set in the middle of May. The revision to Greece\u2019s first quarter GDP figures not only means the country was not in recession, but it has also grown more than the UK, Italy and US. The statistics service Elstat said the Greek economy grew by 0.4% in the three months to March, compared to an earlier estimate of a 0.1% fall. The previous quarter, GDP fell by 1.1%. Two months of negative GDP growth indicate recession, but Greece has now avoided that according to the revised data. The country\u2019s first quarter month on month growth compares to a figure of 0.2% for the UK, which was already at the bottom of the G7 league table. Oil is on the slide, partly thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. There are concerns that the move could lead to more US drilling, which in turn would add to the supply glut that Opec and its allies have been trying to counter with their own agreement to cut output. As a result West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has fallen 2.9% to $46.96 a barrel, while Brent crude is down 2.8% at $49.21. Over in Greece, and the country\u2019s economy has grown unexpectedly in the first quarter despite all the uncertainties surrounding its bailout programme and the struggles to agree a deal with its creditors. Eurozone producer prices have come in lower than expected. They were flat in April compared to a 0.3% fall the previous month and forecasts of a 0.3% rise. Year on year they rose 4.3%, slightly lower than the expected 4.5%. Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit, said: May\u2019s survey data reveals that the UK construction sector has started to recover strongly from its slow start to 2017. House building was the key growth driver, with work on residential projects rising at the fastest pace since December 2015. A sustained rebound in residential building provides an encouraging sign that the recent a soft patch for property values has not deterred new housing supply. Instead, strong labour market conditions, resilient demand and ultra-low mortgage rates appear to have helped boost work on residential development projects in May. Civil engineering continued to flourish, helped by a strong pipeline of infrastructure projects. However, commercial building was trapped in the slow lane amid reports highlighting that heightened economic uncertainty is holding back client spending. The forward-looking elements of the latest survey are reassuring for the construction sector, notably the acceleration in new business growth to its strongest so far this year. On the price front, while construction costs have ratcheted up over the past six to nine months, the wave of inflation from imported materials now appears to have passed its peak. Markit said residential work had replaced civil engineering as best performing category in its survey: A sharp and accelerated rise in residential work was a key factor supporting overall construction activity in May. The housing sub-category has rebounded strongly following the seven-month low seen in March. Moreover, the latest increase in residential building was the fastest since December 2015. Survey respondents cited a strong pipeline of new development projects and resilient underlying demand conditions. Breaking news: The latest UK construction figures show an increase in May rather than the expected decline. The Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers index climbed from 53.1 in April to 56, the highest level since December 2015, helped by a pickup in housebuilding. Analysts had been forecasting a dip to 52.7. The Ahora family behind discount retailer B&amp;M European are a bit richer this morning. The family\u2019s investment vehicle SSA and private equity group Clayton Dubilier have between them sold shares worth around \u00a3454m in a placing to investors. SSA retains 15% and CD 4.9% following the placing. It was done at 363p a share, and in the market B&amp;M has lost 11.3p to 359p. Analyst Nick Bubb said: The B&amp;M share price has had a good run and after last week\u2019s finals guess what: the private equity fund Clayton Dubilier and SSA Investments (the Arora family investment vehicle) have dumped a combined 125m shares (12.5% of B&amp;M\u2019s total issued share capital) at a price of 363.4p, raising aggregate gross sale proceeds of \u00a3454m... [Last week] Simon Arora, the CEO, gushed \u201cB&amp;M has never been in better shape\u201d and, to be fair, the big share placing seems to have gone very well. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: The FTSE 100 took off on the open this morning, shooting up to hit 7,599 for another record intra-day high as the UK market took its cue from the US and a buoyant mood for equities. Investors are ignoring any worries about what Trump\u2019s Paris climate deal shakeout might mean in the short term and instead focusing on renewed reflationary pressures. Whatever risk premium we have around the general election, it\u2019s not bothering equity investors too greatly. We have a sea of green in European indices with global stocks at record highs as June starts on a very upbeat note for riskier assets. After a slight pullback on the whole Trump reflation trade in May that saw defensives in favour, it\u2019s risk-on again. The US market set the tone this morning in Europe with the S&amp;P 500 closing on Thursday at a fresh record high. A solid batch of PMI readings kicked off June in fine style, while we have a situation where central banks remain highly accommodative despite the growth pickup as inflation remains subdued. While we have this scenario it looks very favourable for equities. On the FTSE, shares are rising as part of a global cyclical turnaround and sterling weakness is increasingly less important. The pound is still an important factor in the UK market in terms of overall valuations [but] the FTSE [is] no longer simply reacting to cable; going up with the pound falls and dropping when the pound rises. As has been noted, the more domestically-focused FTSE 250 is also notching record highs, so it\u2019s not enough to explain away the FTSE\u2019s continued strength by saying it\u2019s down to sterling. Get set for the working day - we\u2019ll guide you to the all the business stories you need to read in one really useful email. Click here to sign up. Boom! Britain\u2019s leading index has hit a new peak, touching 7598.99 and within a whisker of 7600. The weaker pound - down 0.17% at $1.2858 - is helping, but the signs of a buoyant global economy - in particular the US - is also providing support. The FTSE 250 is also at a new record, reaching 20,071. Meanwhile the US futures are predicting a 73 point opening on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which could also see it in unprecedented territory. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The markets are looking pretty buoyant this morning, boosted by the prospect of this afternoon\u2019s non-farm jobs report. The FTSE appears to be gunning for a new record this Friday, surging more than half a percent after the bell to sit just a handful of points below 7600. As for the pound, with no new polls \u2013 yet \u2013 to cause it to panic it got off to a rather dull start, dipping 0.1% to 0.2% against both the dollar and the euro. Sterling has tended to do better in the afternoon than the morning this week, once the early political news has been fully digested. Today, however, sees the latest US jobs report, and with the Fed looking to raise rates this month a strong non-farm figure could cause cable\u2019s initial losses to widen. The Eurozone was just as jubilant this Friday, with the DAX and CAC both rising around 1%. That\u2019s pushed the German index back to 12800, and within 50 or so points of a new all-time high, while the CAC is at its best price for a week and a half. There isn\u2019t actually much for the Eurozone to work with this morning, the indices seemingly surging on the prospect of a 21200-crossing open for the Dow Jones later today. Boosted by the gains on Wall Street and in Asia, European markets have made a good start to the day. The FTSE 100 is currently up around 0.4% at 7580, within 6 points of the record high achieved earlier this week. Meanwhile France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.6%, Germany\u2019s Dax 0.7%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has risen 0.48% and the Euro Stoxx index is 0.2% better. And the world stocks index has also hit a new high: Markets appear to be shrugging off the controversial decision by Donald Trump to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement, instead concentrating on the forthcoming US jobs figures. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: As global leaders decried Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Accord, investors were quietly pumping funds into the stock market. Dumping the climate deal hasn\u2019t really hurt of hindered investor\u2019s appetite for risk... Surprisingly good private payrolls data has increased confidence in the US economy ahead of today\u2019s jobs report. The Fed looks set to raise rate this month irrespective of recent data, so investors are glad to see an economy that can withstand it. Expectations are for 185k US jobs to have been created in May, down slightly from the 211k in April with earnings growth of 0.2% m/m. In Asia, Japan\u2019s Nikkei index breached 20k for first time since 2015, matching similar gains in Hong Kong and Australia. European investors look to be taking heart from optimism in Asia and the strong finish on Wall Street with all the major indices set for a higher open. It\u2019s a little quiet on the corporate and economic calendar so it may end up being a wait-and-see type day before the US jobs report. Our live blog on the fallout from Trump\u2019s climate decision can be found here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a big day for the US economy with the latest monthly jobs and wages figures due later. Analysts are expecting another bumper outcome after April\u2019s better than expected number, which would probably put the seal on a US rate rise this month. Originally, forecasts were for an increase of around 180,000 in non-farm payroll jobs. But with Thursday\u2019s forecast-beating private sector job numbers from payroll specialist ADP, that could easily prove conservative. The jobs data helped push US markets sharply higher, with both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hitting new peaks. Meanwhile in Asia, the Nikkei 225 added 1.6%, closing above 20,000 for the first time since 2015. Europe is also forecast to make a strong start, with the FTSE 100 on track for a new intra-day peak: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: European markets look set for a strong open this morning having started on the front foot yesterday, helped by a continuation of the recent theme of an improving economic environment, as further improvements in economic data fuelled a positive start to the month, which was carried on in the US, after Europe had closed. This rise in US markets saw yet more record closes across the board, after a singularly upbeat ADP payrolls report showed that the US economy added 253k jobs in May, well above expectations of 177k. This bumper number more or less confirmed the prospect of a June rate rise, with the potential for further moves later in the year, maybe in September, if the economy holds up. Yesterday\u2019s number also raises the bar for today\u2019s official payrolls report which is expected to come in at around the 180k level, down from 211k in April. This seems rather conservative given the decent ADP number, and the fairly close correlation between the two we\u2019ve seen over the last few months, the March outlier notwithstanding. This would suggest that a number in excess of 200k for non-farm payrolls would be more in line with expectations... Today\u2019s average hourly earnings data for May is [also] likely to be closely scrutinised with a modest increase from 2.5% to 2.6% expected. Before all that, come UK construction figures. In April the construction PMI was lifted by civil engineering and housebuilding and came in at 53.1. This time round it is expected to slip to around 52.7, but this is still a reasonable performance following Thursday\u2019s positive manufacturing figures. Here\u2019s the agenda (all times BST): 9.30: Markit/CIPS UK construction PMI 10.00: Eurozone producer prices index 13.30: US non-farm payrolls data We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events throughout the day.",

We know the Fed is more than happy to look through this kind of thing. Indeed Janet Yellen isn\u2019t that fussed about one quarter of weaker growth, so she\u2019s hardly going to be troubled by a soft-ish month or two of job creation. </p> <p>The recent US data has been pretty solid too and projections for Q2 growth are very upbeat \u2013 the Atlanta Fed reckons 4%, which would make a soft month or two of job creation pretty irrelevant.</p> <p>The big question is not really whether we get a hike in June now but the extent to which the market thinks the Fed is ready to do one or even two more hikes this year. Today\u2019s jobs numbers arguably make the Fed a touch less likely to tighten as quickly as the most hawkish estimates suggest. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-593162dfe4b0be3ed19222ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T13:08:14.210Z\">2.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s more from ING Bank. Economist James Smith said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s US jobs report would have had to be horrendous to worry the Fed, and the sub-consensus wage and jobs numbers won\u2019t derail a June rate hike.</p> <p>To us, the latest dip in non-farm payrolls to 138k looks like nothing more than a return closer to the underlying trend. As the US economy is close to, if not at, full employment, we should be seeing a gradual slowdown in jobs growth. Whilst 200k+ jobs growth sounds good at face value, consistently high readings would raise the possibility that there is more slack in the US economy than previously thought. This is a view that the Fed themselves broadly subscribe to, and they won\u2019t be phased by today\u2019s sub-consensus figure.</p> <p>What they may find more irritating is wage growth, which marginally disappointed markets by coming in at 2.5% year on year. In reality, this is probably more of a statistical quirk rather than anything fundamental. May had three more workdays than April, and as the data doesn\u2019t adjust for this, average hourly earnings will have been temporarily depressed. </p> <p>The underlying story is still a positive one. Labour market tightness still appears to be pushing up pay, but the Fed really needs to see average hourly earnings growth push above 3% if they are to hike more aggressively. And that\u2019s looking increasingly unlikely this year.</p> <p>So what does this all mean for the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle? Well in reality, it would have taken a horrendous report today to make the Fed think twice about a June rate hike. Other recent data has supported the notion that 1Q economic weakness was \u201ctransitory\u201d.</p> <p>But what comes next from the Fed is less assured. Core PCE has struggled to converge on 2%, wage growth has been disappointing and Trump\u2019s fiscal plans are still very uncertain. That means we don\u2019t expect fireworks from the Fed, but even so, we feel a third 2017 rate hike in September still looks more likely than markets are currently pricing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59316081e4b0be3ed19222a2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T12:56:55.305Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But the poor data may not stop an imminent US rate rise:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ING_Economics/status/870621155262156802\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As expected, a weaker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFP?src=hash\">#NFP</a> report.

Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Fambouraris said the government\u2019s goal now was to close the outstanding bailout review so that disbursement of the \u20ac7.5bn Athens owes in imminent maturing debt is made. \u201c[It] will give a boost to the real economy because besides covering our obligations towards creditors the rest of the money will cover requirements of the real economy,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Senior sources in Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led administration say they are bracing for a tough eurogroup meeting on June 15 amid growing signals from senior European officials that the prospect of any debt deal is now off the table.</p> <p>Flambouraris insisted Athens was still holding out for an agreement. \u201cCaught in the row between the IMF and German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble, the government is trying to achieve a solution for the debt that will make it viable,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cWe know very well that this clash does not help our country but despite that we are still trying and hoping.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59314a7ae4b00493c827886b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T11:26:36.377Z\">12.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With just over an hour to go to the latest US non farm payroll figures, there is continuing talk the number could beat forecasts, especially in the light of Thursday\u2019s private sector data from ADP. Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The ADP data released yesterday (which only covers the (private sector) clients of payrolls processing firm ADP) came in at 253,000 jobs versus 180,000 expected) and this has set the stage for a strong number today. Economists expect the US to add 184,000 nonfarm jobs (211,000 in April) though the \u201cwhisper number\u201d is somewhat higher.</p> <p>The unemployment rate is forecast to hold steady at 4.4%, a level which is effectively full employment. The wage inflation number indicator will be highly watched as wage growth has been slower than expected despite labour market tightness. This has been reflected in recent Fed officials\u2019 utterances about undershooting the inflation target of 2%. A strong number will only strengthen the already very strong conviction that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by 25 basis points at their mid-June meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59313edee4b0bdd87e2f2797\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T10:36:25.900Z\">11.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While European markets are soaring, the FTSE 100 has come off its best levels, with commodity companies coming under pressure as the oil price falls. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The FTSE lost its mojo as the morning went on, significantly trailing beyond its rampant Eurozone peers.</p> <p>After striking [almost] 7600 for the first time in its history the UK index quickly fell back, and is now up just 15 points thanks to a series of sharp losses in its commodity sector. Following on from yesterday\u2019s late drop \u2013 inspired by reports of increased oil output in Libya and the US \u2013 Brent Crude has fallen a further 2.5%, leaving the black stuff just above $49 per barrel. That\u2019s because Trump\u2019s decision to remove America from the Paris climate agreement has sparked concerns that the country will ramp up its drilling, negating any output cap implemented by OPEC. This in turn sent Shell and BP down 0.5% to 1%, with the miners also in the red thanks to copper\u2019s 1.7% decline.</p> <p>Free from such troubles the Eurozone soared this Friday, the CAC and DAX jumping 0.8% and 1.4% respectively.</p> <p>The Dow Jones is set to break its own records when the bell rings on Wall Street, with the futures suggesting the index will cross the 21200 mark. That\u2019s because investors are getting excited about this afternoon\u2019s non-farm jobs report. A huge ADP non-farm figure means the current forecasts for a 181k change in the number of employed people may be conservative, while for the past 2 months in a row the unemployment rate has unexpectedly shrank. Wage growth is the only real laggard, with average hourly earnings set to fall from 0.3% to 0.2% month-on-month.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59313c7ce4b0bdd87e2f2788\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T10:23:49.975Z\">11.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax has joined the global rally and also reached a new peak.</strong></p> <p>It has added more than 1.4% to hit 12,850, beating the previous high set in the middle of May.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59313688e4b0be3ed19221b9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T10:01:06.261Z\">11.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greece growing faster than UK</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The revision to Greece\u2019s first quarter GDP figures not only means the country was not in recession, but it has also grown more than the UK, Italy and US.</p> <p>The statistics service Elstat said the Greek economy grew by 0.4% in the three months to March, compared to an earlier estimate of a 0.1% fall.

As has been noted, the more domestically-focused FTSE 250 is also notching record highs, so it\u2019s not enough to explain away the FTSE\u2019s continued strength by saying it\u2019s down to sterling. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59311540e4b00493c8278754\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T07:44:12.292Z\">8.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Get set for the working day - we\u2019ll guide you to the all the business stories you need to read in one really useful email. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">Click here to sign up.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5931135ce4b0be3ed1922116\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T07:33:20.895Z\">8.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 hit new highs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Boom!</p> <p>Britain\u2019s leading index has hit a new peak, touching 7598.99 and within a whisker of 7600. The weaker pound - down 0.17% at $1.2858 - is helping, but the signs of a buoyant global economy - in particular the US - is also providing support.</p> <p>The FTSE 250 is also at a new record, reaching 20,071. Meanwhile the US futures are predicting a 73 point opening on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which could also see it in unprecedented territory. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The markets are looking pretty buoyant this morning, boosted by the prospect of this afternoon\u2019s non-farm jobs report.</p> <p>The FTSE appears to be gunning for a new record this Friday, surging more than half a percent after the bell to sit just a handful of points below 7600. As for the pound, with no new polls \u2013 yet \u2013 to cause it to panic it got off to a rather dull start, dipping 0.1% to 0.2% against both the dollar and the euro. Sterling has tended to do better in the afternoon than the morning this week, once the early political news has been fully digested. Today, however, sees the latest US jobs report, and with the Fed looking to raise rates this month a strong non-farm figure could cause cable\u2019s initial losses to widen.</p> <p>The Eurozone was just as jubilant this Friday, with the DAX and CAC both rising around 1%. That\u2019s pushed the German index back to 12800, and within 50 or so points of a new all-time high, while the CAC is at its best price for a week and a half. There isn\u2019t actually much for the Eurozone to work with this morning, the indices seemingly surging on the prospect of a 21200-crossing open for the Dow Jones later today.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T07:43:49.211Z\">at 8.43am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59310d6be4b0bdd87e2f26af\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T07:08:32.902Z\">8.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets open higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Boosted by the gains on Wall Street and in Asia, European markets have made a good start to the day.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 is currently up around 0.4% at 7580, within 6 points of the record high achieved earlier this week.</p> <p>Meanwhile France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.6%, Germany\u2019s Dax 0.7%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has risen 0.48% and the Euro Stoxx index is 0.2% better.</p> <p>And the world stocks index has also hit a new high:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/870537088965513216\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">World stocks measured by MSCI All World Index hit a fresh record high as upbeat data boosts confidence. <a href=\"https://t.co/APNNlD9Jgj\">https://t.co/APNNlD9Jgj</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0BIiIDhmCn\">pic.twitter.com/0BIiIDhmCn</a></p>&mdash; Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/870537088965513216\">June 2, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T07:29:21.330Z\">at 8.29am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59310b9ce4b00493c8278735\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T06:57:30.419Z\">7.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets appear to be shrugging off the controversial decision by Donald Trump to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement, instead concentrating on the forthcoming US jobs figures.

Analysts are expecting another bumper outcome after April\u2019s better than expected number, which would probably put the seal on a US rate rise this month.</p> <p>Originally, forecasts were for an increase of around 180,000 in non-farm payroll jobs. But with Thursday\u2019s forecast-beating private sector job numbers from payroll specialist ADP, that could easily prove conservative.</p> <p>The jobs data helped push US markets sharply higher, with both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hitting new peaks. Meanwhile in Asia, the Nikkei 225 added 1.6%, closing above 20,000 for the first time since 2015.</p> <p>Europe is also forecast to make a strong start, with the FTSE 100 on track for a new intra-day peak:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/870517584562601984\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our European opening calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTSE&amp;src=ctag\">$FTSE</a> 7593 +0.65%<br>$DAX\u00a012740 +0.59%<br>$CAC\u00a05352 +0.63%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBEX&amp;src=ctag\">$IBEX</a> 10963 +0.75%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MIB&amp;src=ctag\">$MIB</a> 21091 +0.74%</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/870517584562601984\">June 2, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>European markets look set for a strong open this morning having started on the front foot yesterday, helped by a continuation of the recent theme of an improving economic environment, as further improvements in economic data fuelled a positive start to the month, which was carried on in the US, after Europe had closed.</p> <p>This rise in US markets saw yet more record closes across the board, after a singularly upbeat ADP payrolls report showed that the US economy added 253k jobs in May, well above expectations of 177k. This bumper number more or less confirmed the prospect of a June rate rise, with the potential for further moves later in the year, maybe in September, if the economy holds up. Yesterday\u2019s number also raises the bar for today\u2019s official payrolls report which is expected to come in at around the 180k level, down from 211k in April.</p> <p>This seems rather conservative given the decent ADP number, and the fairly close correlation between the two we\u2019ve seen over the last few months, the March outlier notwithstanding. This would suggest that a number in excess of 200k for non-farm payrolls would be more in line with expectations...</p> <p>Today\u2019s average hourly earnings data for May is [also] likely to be closely scrutinised with a modest increase from 2.5% to 2.6% expected.</p> </blockquote> <p>Before all that, come UK construction figures. In April the construction PMI was lifted by civil engineering and housebuilding and came in at 53.1. This time round it is expected to slip to around 52.7, but this is still a reasonable performance following Thursday\u2019s positive manufacturing figures.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the agenda (all times BST):</p> <p>9.30: Markit/CIPS UK construction PMI</p> <p>10.00: Eurozone producer prices index</p> <p>13.30: US non-farm payrolls data</p> <p><em>We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events throughout the day.</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-02T07:13:18.041Z\">at 8.13am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Two brothers who built B&amp;M into a national discount chain selling everything from curtain to biscuits, have cashed in nearly \u00a3230m of shares in the fast-growing business \u2013 taking their total proceeds from the business since it floated to nearly \u00a31bn. The latest share sale, which cut the Arora brothers\u2019 stake to 15% from about 21%, was part of a placing alongside B&amp;M\u2019s private equity backer, Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, which also sold about \u00a3227m of shares. CD&amp;R now owns a 4.9% stake. The Aroras, whose father ran a cash and carry in Manchester, bought B&amp;M in 2005. The business \u2013 founded by Malcolm Billington in Blackpool in 1976 \u2013 was loss-making, with sales of about \u00a365m. Now there are more than 500 of B&amp;M\u2019s blue and orange-striped stores selling homewares and food at knockdown prices. Former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy is chairman and the group owns the Jawoll chain in Europe as well as hundreds of UK outlets. B&amp;M is one of the UK\u2019s fastest growing retailers, benefiting from consumers seeking a cheaper alternative to mainstream supermarkets, health and beauty shops or department stores. In the year to 25 March 2017, sales soared by nearly 20% to \u00a32.4bn as the company opened a new store every week in the UK and 19 in Germany. Pretax profits rose 18% to \u00a3183m. As a result of that success, the brothers \u2013 who live next door to each other and take holidays together \u2013 are now estimated to be worth almost \u00a32bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. B&amp;M\u2019s share price has risen by a third since the company floated on the London Stock Exchange three years ago. In a statement issued to the stock market about the share placing this week, Simon Arora, who is chief executive of B&amp;M, and his brother Bobby, who is trading director, said they remained \u201cfully committed to the business and are confident in the outlook for B&amp;M both in the UK and internationally\u201d. Their SSA Investments vehicle is still B&amp;M\u2019s largest shareholder and the statement said the Aroras were \u201ccommitted to participating in B&amp;M\u2019s exciting future growth prospects\u201d. The last major share sale by the Aroras and their private equity backers was in June 2015, when they raised \u00a3408m between them. That came on top of the \u00a31bn payout they shared when the company floated a year earlier. CD&amp;R, which is thought to have paid the Aroras more than \u00a3500m for a 60% stake in the business in 2012, sold a further \u00a3384m of shares in February 2015. Leahy, who is also an adviser to CD&amp;R, is also thought to have benefited from the private equity group\u2019s share sales. His share in the sale and the stake he still holds in the business, which is headquartered in Luxembourg, has yet to be revealed. B&amp;M\u2019s listing prospectus made clear that Leahy did have an interest in the company but that it was held via a Cayman Islands-registered fund, which controls CD&amp;R\u2019s stake. The brothers have pledged not to sell any more shares in the next six months without prior written consent. CD&amp;R has said it will not dispose of further shares in the next three months.",

CD&amp;R now owns a 4.9% stake.</p> <p>The Aroras, whose father ran a cash and carry in Manchester, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/21/bm-bargains-european-expansion\">bought B&amp;M in 2005</a>. The business \u2013 founded by Malcolm Billington in Blackpool in 1976 \u2013 was loss-making, with sales of about \u00a365m.</p> <p>Now there are more than 500 of B&amp;M\u2019s blue and orange-striped stores selling homewares and food at knockdown prices. Former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy is chairman and the group owns the Jawoll chain in Europe as well as hundreds of UK outlets. </p> <p>B&amp;M is one of the UK\u2019s fastest growing retailers<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/04/retailer-b-and-m-christmas-trading-period-strongest-quarter-since-2013\">, benefiting from consumers </a>seeking a cheaper alternative to mainstream supermarkets, health and beauty shops or department stores.</p> <p>In the year to 25 March 2017, sales soared by nearly 20% to \u00a32.4bn as the company opened a new store every week in the UK and 19 in Germany. Pretax profits rose 18% to \u00a3183m.</p> <p>As a result of that success, the brothers \u2013 who live next door to each other and take holidays together \u2013 are now estimated to be worth almost \u00a32bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. B&amp;M\u2019s share price has risen by a third since the company floated on the London Stock Exchange three years ago. </p> <p>In a statement issued to the stock market about the share placing this week, Simon Arora, who is chief executive of B&amp;M, and his brother Bobby, who is trading director, said they remained \u201cfully committed to the business and are confident in the outlook for B&amp;M both in the UK and internationally\u201d.</p> <p>Their SSA Investments vehicle is still B&amp;M\u2019s largest shareholder and the statement said the Aroras were \u201ccommitted to participating in B&amp;M\u2019s exciting future growth prospects\u201d.</p> <p>The last major share sale by the Aroras and their private equity backers was in June 2015, when they raised \u00a3408m between them. That came on top of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/12/b-m-stock-market-float-ipo-terry-leahy\">\u00a31bn payout they shared when the company floated a year earlier</a>. </p> <p>CD&amp;R, which is thought to have paid the Aroras more than \u00a3500m for a 60% stake in the business in 2012, sold a further \u00a3384m of shares in February 2015.</p> <p>Leahy, who is also an adviser to CD&amp;R, is also thought to have benefited from the private equity group\u2019s share sales. His share in the sale and the stake he still holds in the business, which is headquartered in Luxembourg, has yet to be revealed.</p> <p>B&amp;M\u2019s listing prospectus made clear that Leahy did have an interest in the company but that it was held via a Cayman Islands-registered fund, which controls CD&amp;R\u2019s stake.</p> <p>The brothers have pledged not to sell any more shares in the next six months without prior written consent. CD&amp;R has said it will not dispose of further shares in the next three months.</p>",
