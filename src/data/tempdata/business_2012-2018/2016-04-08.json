      "bodyText": "Two senior Tata Steel executives are among 10 people suspended by the beleaguered company over forgery allegations that have prompted a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. The Guardian understands that Mark Broxholme, the managing director of the company\u2019s speciality steels and bar business was suspended last November. Andrew Parker, the commercial director of the division, was also suspended and has since left the business. The suspension of such senior figures within Tata Steel highlights the seriousness of the claims. The investigation is a further blow to the UK steel business, which is battling to survive after Tata announced it planned to pull out of the country, putting 15,000 jobs at risk. The speciality steels and bar business covers two of Tata\u2019s biggest sites in Rotherham and Stocksbridge, both in Yorkshire, and employs more than 2,000 people. The potential scandal was discovered when an internal audit by Tata found certificates that verify the quality and composition of its steel may have been falsified. The company then informed the SFO about its findings. The SFO said in a statement on Friday: \u201cThe Serious Fraud Office confirms it opened a criminal investigation in December 2015 into activity at Speciality Steels, a business unit of Tata Steel (UK) Ltd. We can make no further comment at this time.\u201d The documents being investigated cover steel sold to about 500 customers, including BAE, Rolls-Royce, and oil and gas firms. Rolls has confirmed it has been contacted by Tata. The safety of the steel is not thought to have been compromised. Tata is understood to have suspended nine people over the allegations last November and another employee in 2016. Broxholme did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment. Emails to his address are met with an automated response that simply says: \u201cAway.\u201d The Tata executive has worked for the company and its predecessors \u2013 Corus and British Steel \u2013 since 1980. He is a leading business figure in the local community and sits on the board of the Barnsley &amp; Rotherham Chamber of Commerce. Broxholme has run the speciality steels and bars business since 2011. As well as the sites in Rotherham and Stocksbridge, the division has service centres in Bolton, India and Suzhou and Xi\u2019an in China. Parker was commercial director of the business between April 2013 and November 2015 according to his LinkedIn profile. Since December he has been \u201cactively seeking a new challenge\u201d, according to the website. Parker could not be reached for comment. Tata Steel said: \u201cWe won\u2019t be commenting on the individuals concerned.\u201d The allegations have emerged as the government tries to find a saviour for Tata Steel in the UK, which employs 15,000 people and includes the Port Talbot steelworks. A number of potential buyers have emerged, including Liberty House, which is run by metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, Greybull, the investment firm, and ThyssenKrupp, the German industrial conglomerate. A management buyout is another option, although this would need financial backing from a third party. However, the scale of the challenge facing any buyer has been laid bare by Ratan Tata, the former chairman of the Tata group and now head of the charitable funds that control the conglomerate. In his first intervention since the Indian firm announced it was selling its loss-making UK business, Tata said job cuts would be necessary to make the Port Talbot steelworks profitable. Speaking at a US Export-Import Bank conference in Washington DC, Tata said the \u201cbottom just opened up\u201d at the UK steel operation after Chinese steel exports poured into Europe. \u201cRight now the problem is that the English facilities are underinvested [and] overmanned,\u201d Tata was quoted as saying by the Financial Times. He said a potential buyer at Port Talbot would need to \u201ccut back on the size and the scale of the operations and make them profitable\u201d. This would be \u201cextremely challenging\u201d but not impossible.",

      "bodyText": "BP is facing a row over boardroom pay at its annual meeting after a leading City investor warned it intended to vote against a $20m (\u00a314m) package for chief executive Bob Dudley. The 20% year-on-year rise in Dudley\u2019s pay was announced last month after the oil company had reported a record loss of $6.5bn and thousands of job cuts. The prospect of a revolt over pay has been brewing since the figure was announced and shareholder advisory bodies have also warned about the package, which included an extra $3.5m for Dudley\u2019s pension. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management, said she would vote against the remuneration report. RLAM owns a 0.7% stake in BP. \u201cThis proposed increase is both unreasonable and insensitive. In a year in which BP has reported its worst ever annual loss, it has decided to sharply boost Mr Dudley\u2019s remuneration,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will be voting against this proposal. While we acknowledge BP has had to weather a turbulent period for oil markets, we strongly believe that executive remuneration should remain tied to performance,\u201d she said. The pension for Dudley and other executive directors \u2013 who receive contributions of around 35% of the salaries \u2013 is thought to be among the areas of concern. Influential shareholder advisory body ISS has advised voting against the remuneration report, highlighting among other things that maximum bonuses are being paid to directors despite BP reporting a loss for 2015. Glass Lewis, another shareholder advisory body, has reportedly also recommended a vote against. A spokesperson for BP said the pay deals were based on the pay policy which shareholders had approved in 2014. \u201cDespite the very challenging environment, BP\u2019s safety and operating performance was excellent throughout 2015 and management also responded early and decisively to the steep fall in the oil price. BP\u2019s performance surpassed the board\u2019s expectations on almost all of the measures that determine remuneration \u2013 and the outcome reflects this. And these clear measures derive directly from BP\u2019s remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM with over 96% of the vote,\u201d the BP spokesperson said. The company holds its annual meeting next Thursday, one of the first high-profile companies in the FTSE 100 to hold their AGMs for this financial year. On the same day, housebuilder Persimmon and mining company Rio Tinto will also meet their investors. In the coming weeks, companies such as Centrica, HSBC and Barclays are also holding annual meetings.",

      "bodyText": "Fears that Japan\u2019s anti-deflation strategy is unravelling have intensified after a sharp rise in the value of the yen against the dollar prompted a concerted attempt by policymakers in Tokyo to talk down the value of the currency. Japan\u2019s finance minister, Taro Aso, raised the prospect of intervention on the foreign exchanges to counter what he called the \u201cexcessive\u201d rise in the yen, which has gained 12% against the dollar since the start of 2016 to stand at a 16-year-high. A weaker yen formed a central plank of the so-called Abenomics programme launched by prime minister Shinz\u014d Abe in late 2012, since a depreciating currency pushes up inflation by making imported goods dearer. But in recent months the yen has been climbing as a result of two factors. Financial markets believe that the Federal Reserve is wary of further increases in US interest rates and were unimpressed when the Bank of Japan failed to respond at its March meeting to the weakness of the dollar. The result has been a flow of money out of the dollar and into the yen, which will make it even harder for the government in Tokyo to raise inflation \u2013 currently 0.3% \u2013 to the target of 2%. \u201cA rapid move toward either yen rise or yen fall is not desirable. It is desirable that currencies are stable at levels that match the economy\u2019s fundamentals,\u201d Aso said on Friday. \u201cAs the G20 confirms, excess volatility and disorderly moves in the exchange market hurt (the economy), so we are watching currency moves with a sense of urgency. We will take necessary steps under certain circumstances,\u201d he added. Analysts at Capital Economics described Aso\u2019s comments as \u201csabre-rattling\u201d and said they were unlikely to be backed up with intervention on the foreign exchanges, in which Japan would buy dollars or sell yen to influence the level of the exchange rate. The consultancy firm noted that Japan had signed up to a joint G20 pledge to refrain from competitive devaluations \u2013 attempts to secure a trading advantage at the expense of another country. Instead, the Bank of Japan is expected to take further action to stimulate the economy in the hope that higher levels of activity will push up prices. The options are limited, and amount to driving interest rates deeper into negative territory or expanding Japan\u2019s quantitative easing (QE) programme. But producing a package that will \u201cshock and awe\u201d the markets is not going to be easy. QE is becoming less and less effective, while the decision to push interest rates below zero has not gone down well with Japanese voters. As a result, the risk is that the Bank of Japan\u2019s response to a rising yen will be underwhelming when it meets at the end of the month. The upshot of that would be a continuation of the yen\u2019s rise, a threat of a further dose of deflation and the prospect of direct action on the foreign exchanges. With protectionism sentiment rising globally, that could start a currency war.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today folks. Thank you for reading the blog and please join us again on Monday. Have a lovely weekend. UK growth halved in the first quarter to 0.3% according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The think tank said that a poor performance from Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector was acting as a drag on the economy, which grew by 0.6% in the final quarter of 2015. If 0.3% growth proves to be correct, it would be the UK\u2019s weakest rate of growth since the fourth quarter of 2012. We will have to wait until 27 April for the first official estimate of first quarter growth, published by the Office for National Statistics. NIESR\u2019s estimate takes into account the weaker than expected UK manufacturing and industrial production figures published earlier on Friday. James Warren, research fellow at NIESR, said: The subdued growth in the first quarter of 2016 has been primarily driven by weakness in production industries, especially manufacturing. The volume of industrial production is currently 10.7% below its pre-recession peak of the first quarter of 2008, while GDP has now surpassed its pre-recession peak by 7%. The European Council has confirmed that it will delay its June summit for five days so that it does not clash with the UK\u2019s Brexit referendum. The council will now meet on 28-29 June, and not 23-24 June as originally planned. The UK will vote on whether or not to remain in the EU on 23 June. Dow Jones: +0.4% at 17,605.86 S&amp;P 500: +0.4% at 2,050.78 Nasdaq: +0.7% at 4,884.44 As in Europe, US investor sentiment is being helped by rising oil prices and Janet Yellen\u2019s upbeat comments about the US economy. Brent crude oil is now up 4.9% or $1.95 at $41.38 a barrel. Investors appear to be hopeful that the world\u2019s top producers will agree to freeze output, and traders were encouraged by Janet Yellen\u2019s comments last night. The Fed\u2019s chair said the US was on a solid course, and suggested the economy would be able to withstand gradual rate rises this year. European markets have been boosted by the rising oil price and more positive sentiment. All major indices have built on earlier gains. Copper prices are heading for their biggest weekly loss in three months because of concerns over lack of global demand and plenty of supply in China. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was trading at $4,635 a tonne, putting it on course for a 3.9% fall this week. It would be the biggest drop since the week ending 8 January, erasing all of copper\u2019s gains so far this year. Carsten Menke, analyst at Julius Baer: Risk-off (sentiment) has weighed on cyclical commodity markets. Copper supplies are set to remain ample as producers are focusing on cutting costs rather than production. Back to Japan... Currency strategists at UBS believe April\u2019s Bank of Japan meeting will be \u201cmake or break\u201d for the yen. UBS has been surprised by the strength of the yen against the dollar, partly because they didn\u2019t think Japan\u2019s policymakers would tolerate yen strength. The bank\u2019s currency strategists say in a research note than unless the central bank unleashes significant stimulus at its April meeting, they will have to cut their dollar/yen forecasts. They write: Our Japanese economists do indeed expect further aggressive easing in April in the form of expanded quantitative easing and further rate cuts, without which we would need to trim our forecast of USD/JPY rising to 122 by year-end. The yen is currently trading at 108.6 against the dollar. According to Reuters, EU leaders are planning to reschedule their regular June summit for after the referendum, to give them time to react to a potential Brexit. David Cameron\u2019s 23 June referendum currently clashes with the first day of the mid-year European Council meeting. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, is proposing to delay the meeting to 28-29 June and is waiting for governments to confirm, Reuters reports. Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, has given his verdict on the UK manufacturing and trade data: UK economy is using low interest rates as life support. It can\u2019t end well A couple of graphs to illustrate Friday\u2019s UK data... Read our full story on the figures here. Commenting on the UK trade figures, the British Chambers of Commerce said it was concerning that exports fell in the last three months while imports rose. David Kern, the BCC\u2019s chief economist: These figures reinforce our view that much more is needed to boost our export performance. This must include a greater emphasis on helping firms to break into new and growing markets. Let\u2019s not forget George Osborne\u2019s pledge in 2012 to double UK exports to \u00a31 trillion by 2020. Back then he was full of hope that Britain would revive its waning fortunes in selling goods abroad. This target now looks wildly out of reach. The Office for Budget Responsibility (the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster) last month lowered its forecasts for UK exports, predicting they would be \u00a3643bn in 2020 - \u201c36% lower than the government\u2019s aspiration\u201d. The pound has fallen back below $1.41 following the weak manufacturing data and wider than expected trade gap. Separate data on the UK\u2019s exports and imports showed the trade deficit was wider than expected in February as imports from the EU rose to a record high of \u00a320bn. The goods trade deficit stood at \u00a311.96bn in February. That was smaller than the gap of \u00a312.16bn in January but bigger than forecasts for a deficit of \u00a310.2bn in a Reuters poll of economists. The UK\u2019s deficit on trade in goods and services together was estimated at \u00a34.8bn in February, a narrowing of \u00a30.4 billion from the revised deficit for January. The ONS said that the goods trade deficit with the rest of the EU hit a record high of \u00a38.6bn in February on the back of record imports from the region. Imports (from the EU) of aircraft, cars, chemicals, electrical machinery, food, live animals, jewellery and oil all increased. The FTSE 100 is still rising, up 0.6% or 40 points at 6,176... \u201cMiserable\u201d. That is what Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, thinks of the industrial production data. Manufacturing was the big drag on industrial production (which also includes mining and utilities), and iron and steel production was the biggest drag on manufacturing (down 37.7% over the year to Feb). Clarke said that while the data was horrible, it was not the end of the world for the economy. While the data did not make pleasant reading, crunching these numbers still leaves us on track for 0.5% q/q GDP growth during Q1 barring a disaster in the services sector. Manufacturing should have a better time once the effects of the weaker pound feed through, as long as pre-brexit vote uncertainty doesn\u2019t get in the way. The UK manufacturing data is a big disappointment and will raise fears that the UK recovery is wavering. The 1.8% annual fall in manufacturing output is the biggest since July 2013. The broader measure of industrial production was also worse than expected, falling 0.3% on a monthly basis. Economists were expecting it to rise by 0.1% On an annual basis industrial production was down 0.5%, and not flat as expected. Bad news for UK manufacturing, with output down 1.1% in February - much more sharply than the 0.2% drop forecast by economists. That means manufacturing output was down 1.8% on annual basis in February. At a time when Britain\u2019s steel industry is in crisis, the Office for National Statistics said UK crude steel production was the lowest since December 2008 in February. Japan\u2019s finance minister Taro Aso said on Friday that he was watching currency moves with \u201ctension\u201d after the yen hit a 17-month high of 107.6 against the dollar. He said the government was prepared to take steps as needed to counter \u201cone-sided\u201d moves in the currency market. His comments helped to take the edge of the yen\u2019s gain, and Japanese markets rose, but the yen has risen 12% against the dollar this year despite negative interest rates. Policymakers were hoping that negative rates would encourage investment and keep the yen low - in turn boosting exports. But the yen has surged on the back of a weaker dollar and because of its status as a save haven investment at a time of global uncertainty. Read our full story here. Brent crude oil is up 2% this morning at $40.22 a barrel. Investors are holding their nerve in what has been a jittery, volatile week. Comments from Fed chair Janet Yellen in the US last night were fairly upbeat about the US economy, helping sentiment. She said the world\u2019s largest economy was on a solid course, and on track to justify more interest rate hikes. Europe\u2019s main stock markets are all up in early trading, with investors no doubt relieved that the German trade data surprised on the upside. The FTSE is up 0.8% or 51 points at 6,187.81. Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING, is not overly impressed by Germany\u2019s stronger than expected export performance in February. This is what he had to say about the news that exports in Europe\u2019s largest economy rose by 1.3% over the month - the biggest increase since September. Some relief but no reason to cheer. February trade data just showed that the German export sector still struggles to gain momentum. German exports have lost parts of their magic and strength. In the past always a reliable growth engine, net exports on average did not contribute anything to quarterly GDP growth over the last two years. In 2015, net exports even were a drag on growth. Brzeski is not hopeful that German exports will be the silver bullet for the flailing eurozone economy any time soon, partly because the euro has appreciated in recent months, making German goods more expensive abroad. Looking ahead, it does not look as if exports would quickly return as a powerful growth engine. The tailwinds of the weak currency are fading away. Since late-November, the euro has appreciated by more than 6 \u00bd% vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar. With strong consumption, a booming construction sector but stagnating industry and exports as well as a reprimand from international institutions to finally step up reform efforts, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy is losing some of its luster. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets and business. Some brighter news for the eurozone this morning, following a week of largely disappointing data and a growing sense from the European Central Bank that 2016 is going to be another tough year. German exports increased more than expected in February, by 1.3% compared with January. It followed two months of falling exports, as demand for German goods waned, and was the biggest monthly rise in five months. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a smaller rise of 0.5%. Signs that foreign demand for German goods is picking up might provide a little cheer to eurozone policymakers left scratching their heads over what to do next to breathe life into the currency-bloc\u2019s economy. German imports increased by 0.4% in February, while economists had forecast a 0.3% fall.",

      "bodyText": "One of the UK\u2019s most famous landmarks, Brighton\u2019s Palace Pier, is being sold to a bar chain run by serial investor Luke Johnson for \u00a318m. The elegant Victorian structure has entered British popular culture with Greta Garbo, Grace Kelly and Winston Churchill all reported to have promenaded along the pier. Musicians from the Who and the Arctic Monkeys have made more recent appearances on the pier, famous for its traditional fairground rides, arcade games and traditional fish and chips. The pier is being bought by the Eclectic Bar Group, which has a variety of trading names including Dirty Blonde, Po Na Na and Coalition. \u201cWe are very pleased to announce the acquisition of Brighton Pier, one of the most iconic and instantly recognisable attractions in the UK,\u201d said Johnson, a former chairman of Channel 4, who is best known for turning Pizza Express into a national chain. \u201cThe pier is hugely popular with the British public and it occupies a special place as a landmark at the heart of Brighton.\u201d The attraction has been owned by the Noble group since 1984. It put the pier up for sale in 2011 but changed its mind a year later. According to Visit Britain, the pleasure pier is the fifth most popular visitor destination in the UK, with over 4.5m visitors in 2014, making it the UK\u2019s most visited attraction outside of London. The attraction, originally known as The Brighton Marine Palace &amp; Pier, opened in 1899, and cost \u00a3137,000 to build. Last year the Grade II-listed pier made a profit before financial charges of \u00a33.5m on sales of \u00a313.3m last year. To fund the deal Eclectic Bar Group plans to place up to \u00a38.5m of new shares with investors, with Johnson, the executive chairman, subscribing for \u00a32.5m of them. A serial entrepreneur, Johnson and Hugh Osmond bought Pizza Express in 1993 for about \u00a320m. The pair grew the business from 12 restaurants to more than 250 and raised the share price from 40p to more than 900p before selling in 1999. Last year, Johnson parachuted in to help turnaround Eclectic, whose19 bars were struggling against intense competition with even its student clientele cutting back on drinking sessions. To get back on track it has slashed head office costs and is trying to sell under-performing bars. There are no plans to move away from the pier\u2019s winning formula and the current management team due to stay in place. \u201cThis acquisition represents the next stage in the group\u2019s development to become a differentiated operator of leisure and entertainment assets,\u201d Johnson said. Eclectic, which is listed on the junior market, plans to change its name to The Brighton Pier Group, trading under the ticker \u201cPIER\u201d, once the deal completes.",

Musicians from the Who and the Arctic Monkeys have made more recent appearances on the pier, famous for its traditional fairground rides, arcade games and traditional fish and chips.</p> <p>The pier is being bought by the Eclectic Bar Group, which has a variety of trading names including Dirty Blonde, Po Na Na and Coalition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/06/great-city-buildings-demolished-destroyed-les-halles\">Sold for scrap: great city buildings that were stupidly demolished</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are very pleased to announce the acquisition of Brighton Pier, one of the most iconic and instantly recognisable attractions in the UK,\u201d said Johnson, a former chairman of Channel 4, who is best known for turning Pizza Express into a national chain. </p> <p>\u201cThe pier is hugely popular with the British public and it occupies a special place as a landmark at the heart of Brighton.\u201d</p> <p>The attraction has been owned by the Noble group since 1984. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/26/brighton-palace-pier-withdrawn-sale\">It put the pier up for sale in 2011 but changed its mind a year later.</a></p> <p>According to Visit Britain, the pleasure pier is the fifth most popular visitor destination in the UK, with over 4.5m visitors in 2014, making it the UK\u2019s most visited attraction outside of London. The attraction, originally known as The Brighton Marine Palace &amp; Pier, opened in 1899, and cost \u00a3137,000 to build.</p> <p>Last year the Grade II-listed pier made a profit before financial charges of \u00a33.5m on sales of \u00a313.3m last year.</p> <p>To fund the deal Eclectic Bar Group plans to place up to \u00a38.5m of new shares with investors, with Johnson, the executive chairman, subscribing for \u00a32.5m of them. </p> <p>A serial entrepreneur, Johnson and Hugh Osmond bought Pizza Express in 1993 for about \u00a320m. The pair grew the business from 12 restaurants to more than 250 and raised the share price from 40p to more than 900p before selling in 1999.</p> <p>Last year, Johnson parachuted in to help turnaround Eclectic, whose19 bars were struggling against intense competition with even its student clientele cutting back on drinking sessions. To get back on track it has slashed head office costs and is trying to sell under-performing bars.</p> <p>There are no plans to move away from the pier\u2019s winning formula and the current management team due to stay in place. \u201cThis acquisition represents the next stage in the group\u2019s development to become a differentiated operator of leisure and entertainment assets,\u201d Johnson said. </p> <p>Eclectic, which is listed on the junior market, plans to change its name to The Brighton Pier Group, trading under the ticker \u201cPIER\u201d, once the deal completes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Banks including Barclays and Santander face a \u20ac5bn (\u00a34bn) bill after a Spanish court ruled that millions of fixed minimum rate mortgages were null and void because of the \u201clack of transparency\u201d in the way they were sold during the property boom. The ruling in a Madrid commercial court comes in response to a class action suit on behalf of 15,000 mortgage holders. The mortgages contain what is known as a cl\u00e1usula suelo, which fixes a minimum monthly payment. So, while still a variable rate mortgage, the bank sets a cut-off point below which payments are not allowed to fall. Some 40 banks are involved, including Caixabank, Barclays, Bankia, and Banco Santander. Caixabank and Bankia abolished cl\u00e1usula suelo mortgages last year. The decision was anticipated by the banking sector and many have already made provisions for a payout. They have 20 days to appeal against the ruling. The clauses were introduced to protect banks from negative interest rates. Most of the estimated 4m mortgages affected were sold during the 1997-2007 property boom when buyers were paying top prices for their homes. When the bubble burst they were unable to benefit from falling interest rates. It is estimated that those affected pay from \u20ac179 (Euribor +0.5%) to \u20ac213 (Euribor +1%) more on a \u20ac150,000 mortgage than they would if they didn\u2019t have a fixed minimum rate mortgage. As the recession set in and people were unable to meet their mortgage repayments, they were evicted in growing numbers, peaking at an average of 500 a day in 2012. Under Spanish law homeowners cannot claim bankruptcy over a mortgage as it is regarded as personal debt. So even after the banks foreclose and repossess a property the former owner still has to pay off the mortgage, as well as associated legal charges. In May 2013, Spain\u2019s supreme court ruled that the mortgages of this type provided by BBVA, Cajamar and NCG were \u201cabusive\u201d. Thursday\u2019s ruling handed down by judge Carmen Gonz\u00e1lez goes further, \u201ccondemning the banks in question to pay back the quantities improperly charged under clauses declared null by the supreme court\u201d. This means the ruling is only retrospective to May 2013. The European court in Strasbourg is expected to rule on 26 April whether the banks\u2019 liability should extend beyond that date. The European commission has already said it believes the payments should be backdated to the date the mortgage was signed, on the grounds that if a clause is declared null, it\u2019s null from the beginning. The ruling does not outlaw this type of mortgage but says the existing mortgages are null because of a lack of transparency on the part of the banks which failed to adequately inform clients what they were signing up to. The class action suit was first brought five years ago by the consumers action group ADICAE. Manuel Pardos, president of ADICAE, praised the judge for her bravery.",

      "bodyText": "The latest news for trade and manufacturing speaks volumes about the state of the UK economy: weak, unbalanced and highly dependent on continued low interest rates to keep it going. This is not the way it was supposed to be. When George Osborne became chancellor six years ago he pledged a new growth model \u2013 one based on exports and humming factory output rather than debt-financed consumer spending. The picture in the spring of 2016 is the opposite of what Osborne promised. Manufacturing production in February fell by 1.1% on the month and was 1.8% lower than in the same month in 2015. It is below its previous peak reached in the first three months of 2008. Steel production was at its lowest level in seven years \u2013 and that was before Tata announced it was selling its UK concerns. Trade is another horror story. Don\u2019t be fooled by the small fall in the monthly deficit between January and February. This only occurred because the January deficit was revised up to \u00a35.2bn from a previously reported \u00a33.5bn. The quarterly data provides a better guide to the underlying trend. The deficit in goods and services in the three months to February stood at \u00a313.7bn, up \u00a33.8bn on the previous quarter and the highest since the first three months of 2008, when the economy was about to plunge into recession. For the time being, another period of falling output looks unlikely. The economy is clearly losing momentum but is being spared an outright recession because consumer demand is relatively robust. But that\u2019s only because interest rates have been pegged at 0.5% for the past seven years, making borrowing cheap. So, here\u2019s the picture. Manufacturing is in a desperately poor state. Consumer demand is robust and cannot be met domestically. The trade deficit is widening. History suggests that this does not end well.",

      "bodyText": "A slump in manufacturing output and drop in steel production to a seven-year low have fanned fears that the UK economy is losing steam and becoming increasingly unbalanced. Official figures showed factory output fell by 1.1% in February, a much sharper decline than economists had been expecting. Even before the UK\u2019s steel crisis escalated last month, crude steel production weakened in January and February and was the lowest for seven years, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Combined with fresh signs of a worsening trade position for the UK, the figures bolstered predictions that the economy slowed in the first three months of this year in the face of faltering global demand, turmoil on financial markets and uncertainty before June\u2019s referendum on EU membership. \u201cThe February trade and industrial production data provide a double whammy of very disappointing news for the UK economy that bodes ill for first-quarter growth prospects,\u201d said Howard Archer, an economist at the consultancy Global Insight. \u201cIt reinforces our belief that GDP growth will have been no better than 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter, down from 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2015.\u201d The National Institute of Economic and Social Research was more downbeat, estimating that Britain\u2019s growth rate halved in the first quarter to just 0.3%, which would be the weakest performance since the last three months of 2012. James Warren, a research fellow at the thinktank, said: \u201cThe subdued growth in the first quarter of 2016 has been primarily driven by weakness in production industries, especially manufacturing.\u201d The government has pledged to boost manufacturing and the wider industrial sector to help wean the UK economy off its overreliance on consumer spending. But while the size of the services sector is now well above its pre-recession level, industrial production is still playing catch-up and more than 10% below its 2008 peak. The manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF said hopes that the UK economy could become more balanced had taken another knock from these latest factory figures, as well as from news earlier in the week that productivity had fallen sharply at the end of last year. Lee Hopley, the EEF\u2019s chief economist, added: \u201cThis points to a fairly dismal first quarter for industry that will again impose a drag on GDP growth.\u201d The ONS said in year-on-year terms, manufacturing output fell 1.8%, the biggest annual decline since July 2013. Industrial output was down 0.5% on the year, the biggest annual fall since August 2013. Simon Wells, the chief UK economist at HSBC, said the figures painted a \u201cdire picture of manufacturing in the UK\u201d. He added: \u201cThe sector is still in its third recession in eight years, and its sixth slump since 1980.\u201d The weakness in manufacturing, which makes up around a tenth of the economy, leaves the onus on the much larger services sector to drive growth. But a survey this week of the sector, which spans hairdressers to banks, showed its progress came to a virtual standstill in March as companies weighed up a combination of risks, including the looming possibility of an exit from the EU. The latest services surveys suggested all sectors were now struggling, said Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cFebruary\u2019s industrial production data bring another clear sign that the economic recovery is slowing,\u201d he said. Friday\u2019s figures showed there was also an unexpected drop in output from the broader industrial sector, which, as well as manufacturing, includes activities like mining and oil extraction. Industrial output fell 0.3% on the previous month. In a further sign that global market turmoil at the start of the year had hurt UK manufacturers, separate figures on the UK\u2019s imports and exports also fared worse than economists had been expecting. The UK\u2019s trade deficit on goods was more than \u00a31bn wider than expected in February as imports from the EU rose to a record high. The trade gap stood at \u00a311.96bn, smaller than an upwardly revised \u00a312.16bn in January but bigger than forecasts for a deficit of \u00a310.2bn in a Reuters poll of economists. The UK\u2019s deficit for trade in goods and services together was estimated at \u00a34.8bn in February, a narrowing of \u00a3400m from the revised deficit for January. The ONS said that the goods trade deficit with the rest of the EU hit a record high of \u00a38.6bn in February. The wider-than-expected trade deficit follows news last week that the UK had clocked up a record current account deficit, which reflects Britain\u2019s trade gap with the rest of the world and the shortfall between money paid out by the UK and money coming in. Friday\u2019s figures \u201cillustrate two of the weakest features of the UK economy \u2013 its trading position and its industrial sector\u201d, said Alasdair Cavalla, a senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. \u201cBoth are on deteriorating trends. The trade position may have slightly improved in February, but the monthly series is erratic. The latest GDP figures for Q4 2015 showed a clear downward trajectory as the quarterly current account deficit grew to its largest level on record, both absolutely and as a share of total output.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Arrium and the future of the Australian steel industry \u2013 four key questions", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On Thursday, steel company Arrium announced it was going into voluntary administration. Arrium employs nearly 10,000 workers in South Australia, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and New South Wales and has racked up $2.8bn worth of debt. The administrators, Grant Thornton, have offered assurances that the company will continue to operate in the short term, but the announcement does little to ease the uncertainty for workers of Australia\u2019s only remaining commercial steel producer. The potential collapse of the company has polarised public opinion, with some wanting direct government intervention in the form of a bailout and others calling for the free market to be able to decide which companies float and which sink. The question is even more pressing for South Australia, with about 3,000 full-time and contractual employees of Arrium working in the state. At 7.7%, SA has the highest unemployment rate in the country. So what can be done to prevent the collapse of Arrium and what makes the steel industry different from other businesses that have gone under in recent times? Why is the steel industry different? Proponents of the steel industry \u2013 including the industry minister, Christopher Pyne \u2013 say it is vital for defence procurement and locally built infrastructure projects. Australia does not even make it into the list of top 20 steel-producing countries, making it particularly sensitive to global trends. Countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including China, Japan, India and South Korea, produce billions of tonnes of steel and often have excess product that they can sell for cheap. Countries or firms may then engage in \u201cdumping\u201d \u2013 that is, charging less for products in foreign markets than they cost in their domestic markets. This effectively destabilises local industry in the importing country. Sometimes, firms that engage in dumping also benefit from subsidies such as loans and tax concessions in their home countries, giving them an extra boost. Moreover, foreign firms may use circumvention to get around Australia\u2019s high standards when it comes to steel imports, by adding other alloys to their products. The current \u201cglut\u201d of steel on the market has caused prices to plummet to a 12-year low and Arrium has tried to recoup costs by shedding jobs, losing about 1,200 workers since July 2011. How has foreign dumping and circumvention affected the market? Yes. Australia\u2019s anti-dumping commissioner, Dale Seymour, told a Senate inquiry earlier this week that the vast bulk of his work \u2013 about 75% \u2013 was taken up by investigating steel imports. He said his counterparts around the word thought Australia\u2019s anti-dumping laws were robust but that view was not necessarily shared by global firms. \u201cIt sort of annoys me that we may be considered a soft touch when I think about how hard we work,\u201d Seymour said on Wednesday. Labor\u2019s industry spokesman, Kim Carr, said Arrium has been \u201csubject to intense assault by foreign steel companies backed by their governments\u201d. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t allow national interest to be squandered here,\u201d Carr told ABC radio on Thursday night. He also raised concerns about the impact of lower-quality steel imports on major infrastructure projects. \u201cWe are importing steel that is substandard and evidence put to the Senate committee suggests it\u2019s dangerous. We simply can\u2019t wait till one of these bridges falls down, as we saw in Israel a few years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a real chance that the substandard product being put into Australian infrastructure could lead to a major national catastrophe.\u201d The vocational education minister, Scott Ryan, criticised Carr for \u201cnot being rational\u201d in raising concerns about foreign steel standards. \u201cHe\u2019s saying we should be scared of foreign steel. That is an outrageous thing. There are thousand of Australians who work with imported products. There are thousands whose jobs rely on international trade,\u201d Ryan told ABC TV on Friday. Can anything be done to save the industry? The government and opposition have different ideas on how to bolster the Australian steel industry. The government wants Arrium to be able to trade its way out of debt and has brought forward a rail infrastructure project in order to expedite the need for Australian steel. \u201cThat\u2019s a contract worth $80m plus and I as the industry minister am using the anti-dumping commission rules to protect Australian businesses from being injured by unfair Chinese, Taiwanese, Malaysians, South Korean competition,\u201d Pyne told the ABC\u2019s 730 program on Thursday night. \u201cWe\u2019re doing what we can. We\u2019re using the levers that are at our disposal.\u201d In November, the Coalition announced it would strengthen anti-dumping laws by increasing penalties against uncooperative operators and bolstering the anti-dumping commission. Labor does not think the changes go far enough and has called on state and federal governments to ensure infrastructure projects use Australian-grade steel, thereby excluding cheaper, substandard alternatives. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, told a people\u2019s forum in Brisbane on Wednesday night that he was unapologetic about being an \u201ceconomic nationalist\u201d. \u201cIs there a role for government to help business? Yes there is,\u201d Shorten said. The Coalition says preferencing Australian steel potentially breaches our free-trade agreements. \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing Bill Shorten do is engage in negative knee-jerk reactions which don\u2019t engage in the issues,\u201d treasurer Scott Morrison told ABC Radio on Friday. \u201cYou don\u2019t get involved in a kneejerk reaction the sort of thing that says: let\u2019s tear up our trade agreement, let\u2019s tear up the jobs in the new economy to go and play politics with an issue in South Australia.\u201d The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry called Shorten\u2019s comments \u201ca protectionist response\u201d. \u201cAustralia must not give up on driving reform in the parts of the economy that are globally uncompetitive,\u201d a spokeswoman, Patricia Forsythe, said. \u201cAustralia can have a viable steel industry if appropriate infrastructure and workplace relations policies are in place.\u201d Shorten has dismissed the concerns, saying \u201canything that Labor suggests will be consistent with our international trade obligations\u201d. Seymour told the Senate committee that the anti-dumping commission uses World Trade Organisation guidelines as a framework for the all the work it does, too. The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union wants the government to take a more interventionist approach. \u201cMinister Pyne could do something right now by committing to procure Australian-made steel for all government supported projects, by levying emergency safeguard tariffs on imported steel and by starting to get serious about creating a level playing field which supports regional industries and the families and communities which rely on it,\u201d the SA state secretary of the union, Aaron Cartledge, said. Is a cash bailout on the cards? Arrium has not asked for one but federal Labor and the SA government are both open to the idea of co-investing in the company. The SA treasurer, Tom Koutsantonis, told reporters on Thursday that the state may offer the company money to keep operating, but would not be drawn on how much that would cost taxpayers. \u201cI\u2019m not going to give you a number,\u201d he said. \u201cCapital improvements are much better than ongoing subsidies.\u201d Pyne appeared cool on the idea of a bailout, calling it a \u201cblunt instrument\u201d. The former federal Liberal frontbencher Eric Abetz went one step further, denouncing a bailout as a \u201csinkhole\u201d for taxpayer money. \u201cThe private sector does need to be responsible for itself and its decisions,\u201d he told Sky News on Thursday. \u201cEverything the government can do that\u2019s short of throwing good taxpayer\u2019s money, then of course we should try to assist in that regard.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Labor has called on the government to launch a royal commission into banks and financial services and said, if it refuses, Labor would do so if elected. The decision was announced on Friday by the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, and the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen. The royal commission would conduct a two-year inquiry into the banking and financial services sectors, including superannuation funds, and cost $53m. Shorten said the sector had been rocked by a string of scandals that were \u201cnot isolated and one-off examples\u201d but rather pointed to systemic problems in the industries. Shorten said calling a royal commission was \u201can important decision, it\u2019s most certainly not made lightly\u201d. \u201cAustralia has one of the strongest banking sectors in the world and we want to keep it strong,\u201d he said. \u201cBut public confidence in the banking and financial services industry has taken hit after hit over the previous few years. Many Australians have suffered through the decisions of banks and financial institutions. \u201cRetirees who have lost their retirement savings, small businesses who have lost their livelihood, Australian families who have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars, life insurance beneficiaries denied justice and legitimate claims. There are literally tens of thousands of victims if not more. And today I say enough is enough.\u201d Bowen said the royal commission\u2019s objectives would include considering how widespread illegal and unethical behaviour is, banks\u2019 duty of care to consumers, how culture, ethical standards and business structures affect conduct, and whether Australia\u2019s regulators are well equipped to identify and prevent illegal and unethical behaviour. Recent bank scandals include the Commonwealth Bank financial planning scandal, allegations CommInsure may be routinely denying legitimate claims from sick and dying customers and an Australian Securities and Investment Commission (Asic) suit against Westpac for alleged rate rigging. On Thursday Shorten had refused to rule out a royal commission, prompting criticism from the treasurer, Scott Morrison, who labelled the idea a \u201creckless distraction\u201d from a bill to introduce a tougher construction industry regulator. Morrison said responses to banking scandals needed to be proportional. He said \u201cthe problems have been identified and are being dealt with\u201d by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic), which he called \u201ca tough cop on the beat\u201d. He said calling for a royal commission implied widespread corruption in the banking industry, which would harm the international reputation of Australia\u2019s banks. \u201c[Labor] voted against it a year ago,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cApparently on the eve of the election there are a few [news] reports about banks and Bill Shorten is there in his ill-fitting suit saying we need to thump the table.\u201d After Labor\u2019s announcement, Morrison reiterated the comments. \u201cThe government is not proposing a royal commission and has opposed one consistently,\u201d he said. Morrison added that the Murray financial system inquiry did not back a royal commission. Shorten rejected the claim the banking royal commission was a distraction and said it was negligent to ignore the scandals. \u201cLabor sadly hasn\u2019t invented tens of thousands of financial victims,\u201d he said. The Australian Bankers\u2019 Association\u2019s chief executive, Steve Munchenberg, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t understand what this royal commission is meant to achieve.\u201d Munchenberg acknowledged there had been \u201ctoo many incidences where banks have failed to live up to their own standards and the standards of their customers\u201d. But banks were already subject to incredible scrutiny, including parliamentary financial sector inquiries and oversight by Asic, he said. Munchenberg said the royal commission sent a worrying signal and would decrease confidence in the banking system. Foreign investors would \u201cbe asking what is wrong with Australian banking sector\u201d. Industry Super Australia welcomed the call for a royal commission. It said it was \u201cincreasingly concerned that the lack of community trust and confidence in the scandal-prone banks could infect public confidence in their lines of business in compulsory super\u201d. The industry super fund group said the royal commission should consider banks\u2019 vertically integrated business model and whether to structurally separate banks and super. Pressure has grown for a royal commission into banks, with the MP Warren Entsch calling for one on Thursday. He joins the Greens and crossbench senators in backing the idea. On Wednesday the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, highlighted wrongdoing by banks in an address to Westpac. The prime minister said: \u201cWe have to acknowledge that there have been too many troubling incidents over recent times for [concerns to] simply to be dismissed. \u201cRedressing wrongs is important, especially where it is done promptly and generously.\u201d Entsch welcomed Turnbull\u2019s recognition of problems in the sector but said \u201can apology from the big banks and a commitment not to do it again in the future is not enough\u201d. \u201cI believe we need to go further \u2013 we need a full royal commission into the profit-driven and immoral activities of the big banks and they must pay an appropriate level of compensation to clients for past wrongs,\u201d he said. Last year Labor joined the government to vote down a Greens proposal for a royal commission into banks. The Nationals senator John Williams crossed the floor to support the proposal.",
