      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU has sent further shock waves through financial markets, with three more property funds suspended, the pound plunging and share prices falling amid fresh uncertainty about the economic impact of the decision to leave the EU. Funds responsible for investing some \u00a314bn in shopping centres, office blocks and warehouses have now locked out investors following the decision by Henderson, Columbia Threadneedle and Canada Life to suspend dealing on Wednesday after being swamped by investors attempting to redeem their cash. The three made their announcements after Standard Life, Aviva and Prudential\u2019s M&amp;G barred investors from withdrawing their cash earlier in the week. The suspensions mean that half of all UK retail property funds are suspended, according to calculations by Hargreaves Lansdown, and there were expectations that more would follow. Another fund Aberdeen Asset Management said it was reducing the dealing price by 17% and would be suspended until Thursday. The pressure on the commercial property sector \u2013 which had enjoyed a 40% rise in prices from 2009 until the start of this year \u2013 came after the pound hit fresh 31-year lows, and shares in London also fell. The pound fell as low as $1.2796 \u2013 a level last seen in June 1985 \u2013 at one point on Wednesday and is still well below the $1.50 sterling had reached immediately after the polls closed on 23 June. Analysts said it could fall to $1.20 amid warnings of a slowdown in UK growth and the prospect of a cut in UK interest rates as soon as next week. \u201cThe pound seems particularly sensitive to news from the UK construction sector, which is being seen as a bellwether for Brexit concerns in general,\u201d said Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics. The FTSE 100 index \u2013 which has rallied over the past week on the back of the falling pound \u2013 sunk back by just over 1% to close at 6463.6 as fears of a price war sent shares in supermarkets lower. Banks, insurers and property companies were also down. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group were among the biggest fallers and identified by analysts as the major banks having the greatest exposure to the property sector. While the blue chip index remains above its pre-Brexit vote levels, the FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies \u2013 regarded as more closely tied to the UK economy as it contains fewer businesses that trade internationally \u2013 is down 10% since the referendum result, after falling another 0.4% to 15669 on Wednesday. In a race for perceived safe havens, investors have turned to government bonds, pushing down yields. The yield on a 10-year German government bond fell to a new low of minus 0.20%. An analyst at Bernstein said RBS and Lloyds had \u00a319bn and \u00a313bn of commercial property loans respectively. Shares in RBS have fallen to levels they traded at in 2009, pushing back the point at which the government can sell its 73% stake at a profit. Lloyds is also trading well below the level at which the government can profit by selling its 9% holding. Raul Sinha, an analyst at JP Morgan, said: \u201cWhile the major UK banks have \u00a369bn of exposure we highlight smaller banks and building societies have exposure of \u00a317bn but at higher loan-to-values.\u201d Commercial property lending by banks is down from \u00a3150bn in 2011 with foreign investors now accounting for 40% of the funding for the sector. With the focus on the property funds, Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said investors should not make decisions in a panic. \u201cOver half of the property fund sector is now on ice, and will remain so until managers raise enough cash to meet redemptions. To do that they need to sell properties, and as any homeowner knows, that is not a quick or painless procedure\u201d. Shaun Port of the online investment company Nutmeg said: \u201cWe think all of these funds will now [close], probably for the remainder of the year. Investors tend to invest on the understanding that they can sell their investment at any time, but the underlying assets \u2013 large buildings \u2013 are themselves very hard to sell at short notice.\u201d However, amid all the gloom the UK\u2019s trade minister said Brexit could lead to a \u201csecond golden age of trade and investment\u201d. Speaking on his first foreign visit since the referendum, Mark Price, said that Britain could now free itself from EU\u2019s \u201cbureaucratic tendencies\u201d and that a fall in the value of sterling will help exporters and attract new investment. Lord Price, the former boss of Waitrose, said: \u201cThe key message here is that we have a strong economy, we remain a fantastic place to invest, and have plenty of innovative, successful businesses. I have every confidence we will make this work.\u201d However, uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum was blamed for the fall in the latest business barometer from Lloyds Bank, which showed a collapse in confidence across most sectors of the economy. Conducted in the week after the EU referendum, the bank\u2019s confidence index tumbled 26 points to 6% in June, leaving it at the lowest level since 2012, when the euro sovereign debt crisis was in full swing.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve held off on raising interest rates in June due to uncertainty about the US labor market as well as a then-upcoming vote on whether the UK would exit the European Union, according to notes released on Wednesday. The US central bank last met on 14 and 15 June. It was the Fed\u2019s fourth meeting since it raised interest rates in December. Last year\u2019s hike was the first one in almost a decade. The Fed was expected to raise interest rates four times this year. The forecast has since been adjusted to just two hikes in 2016. \u201cMost participants noted that the upcoming British referendum on membership in the European Union could generate financial market turbulence that could adversely affect domestic economic performance,\u201d according to notes from June\u2019s meeting. The Fed thought \u201cit would be prudent to wait for the outcome of the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom on membership in the European Union in order to assess the consequences of the vote for global financial market conditions and the US economic outlook\u201d. A week after the June meeting, when testifying in front of Congress, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen repeated that sentiment noting that while it was difficult to predict what might actually happen if the UK decided to leave the EU, the Fed would carefully monitor the situation. The UK voted to leave the EU on 23 June. On Friday and Monday after the vote, the major US markets suffered their biggest two-day losses in 10 months. They have since recovered, and on Friday, the S&amp;P closed at 2,103. \u201cThe attitude of US investors appears to [be] skepticism that the UK will ever leave the EU and, if it does, that the global fallout can be largely contained,\u201d said Ian Williams, strategist at Peel Hunt. Also worrying the Fed was the most recent job report, which found that the US economy had added just 38,000 jobs in May \u2013 about 122,000 fewer than expected. The Fed noted that job growth in the US has been slowing over the past few months and attributed May\u2019s disappointing report to the 44-day strike by Verizon workers. \u201cAlmost all participants judged that the surprisingly weak May employment report increased their uncertainty about the outlook for the labor market,\u201d the notes said. The next job report will be released Friday and might include upward revisions to May\u2019s numbers. Last time Verizon workers went on strike, for two weeks in August 2011, the department of labor reported that the economy added no jobs that month. Reports released in the next two months, however, showed a growth of 104,000 jobs. The cautious tone struck by the Fed during the June meeting implies that there might be no hike when the central bankers next meet on 26 and 27 of July. The target range for the federal funds rate is likely to remain between 0.25 and 0.5% for at least two more months. The Fed will then meet at the end of September, which some say could be too close to the presidential election. \u201cWith uncertainties about the outlook and inflation being lower than desired, it allows us to be a little more patient,\u201d William Dudley, president of the New York Fed and a voting member of the Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee, said Tuesday. Among his reasons for caution were the low inflation and the uncertainty around the EU referendum. Hours before the notes from the June meeting were released, Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo told the Wall Street Journal that he wants to wait until inflation moves closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target before voting in favor of another interest rate hike.",

And though the world\u2019s wealthiest were able to raise that income to $1.36m within one year, they are still not making as much as they were just before the 2008 recession. Saez revealed that in 2015, the rich were also taking home larger chunk of the US income. \u201cThe share of income going to the top 10% of income earners \u2013 those making on average about $300,000 a year \u2013 increased to 50.5% in 2015 from 50.0% in 2014, the highest ever except for 2012,\u201d Saez wrote. \u201cThe share of income going to the top 1% of families \u2013 those earning on average about $1.4m a year \u2013 increased to 22% in 2015 from 21.4% in 2014.\u201d According to him, while the 1% power ahead and continue to reclaim income lost during the recession, a full recovery for the bottom 99% remains elusive. \u201cSix years after the end of the Great Recession, those families have recovered only about 60% of their income losses due to that severe economic downturn,\u201d he said. It should not come as a shock that to many Americans talk of economic recovery rings hollow. The top 1% of families saw their income grow by 37% between 2009 to 2015, from $990,000 to $1.36m. The incomes of the other 99%, however, grew by just 7.6% during that time \u2013 from $45,300 in 2009 to $48,800 in 2015. In 2015, the income of the 99% grew by just 3.9%. After factoring in inflation, Saez calls it: \u201cthe best real income growth in 17 years\u201d. And the rich? At 7.7%, their growth was twice that. Economy remains a top concern for US voters, according to a recent Gallup survey of 1,530 adults. More than 90% of them said that economy was extremely important to them and 89% of them said the same of jobs and employment. The income inequality has not escaped the attention of the Obama White House or those vying to succeed him. \u201cInequality is still too high,\u201d Barack Obama said in June while speaking about the US economy in Elkhart, Indiana. \u201cThe gap between rich and poor is bigger now than it\u2019s been just about any time since the 1920s.\u201d For much of his two-term presidency, Obama has been pushing the US Congress to raise the federal minimum wage in hopes that it would raise incomes of the poorest Americans. Both former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who are running for president as Democrats, have pushed for higher minimum wage and spoken about income inequality on the campaign trail. The uneven recovery is one of the reasons that experts say this presidential election cycle has seen the rise of Donald Trump and a contentious race for the Democratic nomination.",

      "bodyText": "The government would consider nationalising Tata Steel, the minister for small business has said, as she warned leaving the EU could further damage the struggling steel industry. Giving evidence to MPs on a joint select committee session about the steel industry, Anna Soubry said she remains confident that Tata Steel will find a buyer for its UK business, despite economic volatility triggered by the Brexit vote. She renewed the government\u2019s pledge that it stands ready to lend money \u201con commercial terms\u201d to any eventual buyer, or take an ownership stake in the business. \u201cWhen we faced the crisis with Tata \u2026 you can be assured we looked at all options and one of those was whether or not, my phrase, to \u2018buy it for a quid\u2019. When you make political determination that you\u2019re going to keep at least one of the blast furnaces [at Tata\u2019s Port Talbot steelworks] open, you look at all options.\u201d The government has suggested it could co-invest with a potential buyer by taking a 25% stake in the business. Soubry also did not rule out full nationalisation on a temporary basis, if the sale process collapses. The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency includes Port Talbot, asked if full nationalisation was on the table if a buyer can\u2019t be found and Tata Steel shutters the businesss. The small business minister repeated that \u201call options\u201d were on the table. Soubry, who campaigned to remain in the EU, warned that Brexit could have profound consequences\u201d for the British steel industry, regardless of Tata\u2019s sale process. Steelmakers have struggled under the burden of high energy costs and the dumping of cheap steel onto the market by Chinese firms. Soubry said Britain\u2019s influence in European efforts to tackle the problem would now be diminished because \u201ceverybody knows that you\u2019re going to clear off as soon as you can\u201d. She said a full exit would have a \u201chuge impact\u201d on the steel industry\u2019s ability to export to the EU and pointed to the possible effect on automotive firms such as Nissan, which gets 45% of its steel slab from Port Talbot. Nissan and Toyota both benefit from tariff-free access to EU customers and Soubry warned that leaving the union could see other countries levy duties on cars coming from the UK. \u201cIf you\u2019re a multinational company, you\u2019re not going to make it in Britain if you can make in in the EU to sell it in the EU free of tariffs,\u201d she said. Soubry also dismissed suggestions that leaving the EU could help the government support the steel industry by freeing it up to provide state aid or slap punitive tariffs on Chinese steel. \u201cIf we want access to the single market, we can\u2019t set our own tariffs. I can\u2019t imagine that the EU would allow us access to the single market but not make us party to the state aid rules.\u201d Despite reiterating that the government could provide financial support to secure a buyer for Tata Steel, Soubry cast doubt on suggestions that the government could change the law to allow the British Steel pension scheme to avoid being folded into the Pension Protection Fund. She said it would set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d to make special arrangements for one pension scheme \u201cgiven that so many pension schemes face difficulties\u201d. The business minister, Sajid Javid, is due to fly to Mumbai ahead of Friday\u2019s board meeting at Tata, the Indian conglomerate that owns Tata Steel UK. \u201cThis is part of our ongoing dialogue with Tata to maintain momentum and achieve a long-term solution for UK steelmaking,\u201d the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said in a statement.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A quick mini-recap: The Brexit crisis has driven the pound down below $1.30 to levels last seen in 1985. Three more commercial property funds have suspended trading, after a rush of redemptions requests following the referendum. They are Columbia Threadneedle, Canada Life and Henderson. That takes the total to six, and means half of Britain\u2019s \u00a325bn property fund sector is now on ice. Analysts believe investors won\u2019t be able to get their money back for months. Stock markets have fallen again, hit by fears that the EU referendum is now hitting the UK economy, and beyond. Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 has lost some 10% of its value since the referendum. Concerns are also growing over Italy\u2019s bank sector, whose shares have tumbled by a third since the Eu referendum. Banca Monte Dei Paschi Di Siena has until Friday to devise a plan to deal with its bad banks. Accountancy firm KPMG has warned that the Brexit vote has hit M&amp;A activity: And the latest minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s June meeting show that US central bank policymakers were worried about the consequences of last month\u2019s referendum. That\u2019s all for tonight, we reckon. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Newsflash: The US central bank cited the Brexit vote as a reason to hold interest rates unchanged last month. Minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting in mid-June showed that policymakers wanted to hold off until Britain had held its EU referendum, a week later. The minutes state that: \u201cMembers generally agreed that, before assessing whether another step in removing monetary accommodation was warranted, it was prudent to wait for additional data on the consequences of the U.K. vote.\u201d They also cited the surprisingly weak US jobs figures as another reason that they held fire on a rate hike. Britain\u2019s decision to vote to leave the EU means many economists now expect the Fed to leave rates on hold until the end of this year. Bank shares have been under pressure again today - as recorded in an earlier post - and a couple of analysts have looked at the exposure of the major lenders to the property sector, which was a headache for many of them in 2008 crisis. At Bernstein, analysts have calculated the bailed out banks Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group are the most exposed - with aroudn \u00a319bn and \u00a313bn of loans respectively. The banking sector\u2019s exposure is already down from \u00a3150bn to \u00a386bn according to Bank of England data. \u201cBanks haven\u2019t really played the asset class in the last five years - it\u2019s mostly been the shadow banking sector,\u201d said the Bernstein analysts. Raul Sinha, analyst at JP Morgan, says the major UK lenders have \u00a369bn of the loans and the smaller banks and building societies some \u00a317bn (which is also at the riskier end). Sinha\u2019s view is that: \u201cRisks for the major UK banks are manageable, small lenders in focus\u201d. RBS\u2019 exposure is 66% of its tangible net asset value, according to Sinha. The annual report of RBS shows that the proportion of the loan book with loan to values of more than 75% has fallen and the deals where the value of the property is less than the loan are largely loans from the past. Canada Life has sent over a statement, confirming that it has suspended redemptions from its commercial property funds. It blamed \u201congoing uncertainty around the pricing of commercial property assets\u201d following the vote to leave the European Union, and the recent rise in requests to withdraw (or switch) from the property fund . A spokesperson from Canada Life explained: \u201cFollowing last month\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, a combination of uncertainty around the pricing of commercial property assets and the recent rise in requests to withdraw from property funds, has meant Canada Life taking the decision to immediately defer requests for withdrawals. Deferring requests to withdraw allows us to protect the interests of all investors in the property fund, including those who plan to remain invested for the medium to long term.\u201d The pound is ending the day where it began it, at its lowest levels since 1985 against the US dollar. Sterling is hovering around $1.294 tonight. The rush of property fund freezes has not helped the mood in the City. And with the Bank of England likely to cut interest rates soon, analysts are predicting more pain for the pound. A correction: Columbia Threadneedle actually suspended redemptions at noon today, not 11am as I wrote earlier. Sorry for any confusion. Shaun Port, CIO of investment group Nutmeg, predicts that Britain\u2019s property fund will soon all be gated, and remain locked until the end of 2016. He says: This is a stark reminder that low volatility does not mean low risk. \u201cInvestors tend to invest on the understanding that they can sell their investment at any time, but the underlying assets - large buildings - are themselves very hard to sell at short notice. They require weeks or months to sell. Worse, some properties under development cannot be sold until development work is completed.\u201d This chart shows how a downturn in commercial real estate (CRE) would hurt Britain\u2019s banks: Brexit fears have hit shares across Europe again today. The FTSE 100 index has closed down 81 points, or 1.25%, at 6463. Tesco (-8%) and Morrisons (-7%) were the biggest fallers, due to the price war fears we covered earlier. The FTSE 250 index of smaller, UK-focused, companies closed down 0.4% at 15669, so almost 10% below its pre-referendum levels. Germany\u2019s DAX stock index shed 1.7%, while Spain\u2019s IBEX fell 1.9%. Financial shares have had another bad day; the Stoxx 600 bank share index closed at its lowest level since November 2011 (the peak of the eurozone debt crisis, when Greece and Italy\u2019s governments were toppled). Joshua Mahony of IG says investors are fleeing into safe assets, because of the dangers created by the Brexit vote. Global markets are on the back foot once more today, as the fears that seemed to fade over the last week reappear once more. Despite the rallying cries of Boris Johnson, markets are not waving away the implications of the referendum result by focusing in on last week\u2019s FTSE 100 remarkable recovery. Instead, a focus upon the continued deterioration in the pound and euro highlights the negative economic consequences of that vote. In a world where around $10 trillion of global government credit has yields at or below zero, it is clear that investors are desperately seeking for safety wherever it can be found. Today\u2019s 27-month high in gold and Monday\u2019s near two-year high for silver highlights the underlying rush to havens in an increasingly uncertain future. Canada Life have now confirmed that they have indeed frozen trading in their UK property fund. More than half the UK\u2019s \u00a325bn property investment sector has now been suspended this week, as Brexit fears hit the economy. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, predicts that Aviva, Standard Life, M&amp;G, Columbia, Henderson and (apparently) Canada Life will leave their funds frozen for months. Here\u2019s his take: \u201cOver half of the property fund sector is now on ice, and will remain so until managers raise enough cash to meet redemptions. To do that they need to sell properties, and as any homeowner knows, that is not a quick or painless procedure. These funds are therefore likely to be closed for weeks and months rather than simply a matter of days. Clearly there has been a knee-jerk reaction to Brexit in the commercial property sector, which may moderate over time. Investors in commercial property funds should not make decisions in a panic. Granted the Brexit vote may have the potential to negatively affect the commercial property market in the short run, but long term investors should be willing to ride out periods of weakness, particularly when there has been such a sharp decline in fund prices without much evidence of a slowdown in the underlying property market.\u201d There\u2019s a rumour that Canada Life have also frozen redemptions in their property fund... #unconfirmed Here\u2019s another consequence of Brexit angst: investors now expect UK interest rates to remain at ultra-low levels for the rest of the decade: The Bank of England is due to announce its next interest rate decision next Thursday. Another one! Columbia Threadneedle has announced that it has suspended dealings in its \u00a31.4bn property fund, as of noon today (11am GMT) *CORRECTED*. It blames uncertainty following the EU referendum, and predicts that retail outflows will continue for some time. The British Chamber of Commerce in Germany (BCCG) has warned companies trading between the two countries that they should prepare for a worst-case scenario where Britain ends up trading with the European Union \u201con the same terms as Panama\u201d. At a press conference in Berlin on Wednesday, BCCG council member Stefan Kraus said it was \u201chard to imagine that a trade deal between Britain and the EU would be passed unanimously by all 38 parliaments who have a veto\u201d and there was therefore \u201ca risk that there won\u2019t be an agreement after two years\u201d and trade relations would revert back WTO rules. Referring to the stalling negotiations over the CETA trade deal between the EU and Canada, Kraus said: \u201cWe are currently experiencing how difficult it is to close trade deals. A trade between the EU and Great Britain would be probably be as far-reaching as CETA.\u201d Kraus called on companies involved in trade between Britain and Germany to do \u201cBrexit due diligence\u201d over the course of the next two or three months: \u201cThose who wait for two years to make a decision will find it is too late to react if no deal materialises\u201d. Henderson\u2019s property fund is valued at around \u00a33.9bn. So there is now around \u00a313bn of savers\u2019 money now locked up in commercial property funds. For how long, who knows? Henderson, along with Aviva, Standard Life and M&amp;G had all bought property assets such as supermarkets, office blocks, warehouses. Investors knew that could try to leave these \u2018open-ended\u2019 funds at any time, but they also knew that the company\u2019s could freeze them if too many redemption requests were made at once. Here\u2019s Henderson\u2019s statement: Breaking: Investment fund Henderson has just announced that it is suspending trading in its property fund. This means investors will not be able to redeem their money right now, and must wait for the company to ungate the fund, sometime in the future. Henderson took the move after seeing a surge of requests, after the EU referendum - just like Aviva, Standard Life and M&amp;G earlier this week. The US services sector grew in June, with new business expanding at the fastest rate since January. The headline index on the Markit PMI edged up slightly to 51.4 from 51.3 in May, where anything above 50 indicates growth. However, business expectations weakened, and jobs in the sector were created at the slowest pace in 17 months. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit: Rebound, what rebound? The final PMI numbers confirm the earlier flash PMI signal that the pace of US economic growth remained subdued in the second quarter. While volatile official GDP numbers are widely expected to show a rebound from a lacklustre start to the year, the PMIs suggest the underlying malaise has not gone away. The surveys point to an annualized pace of economic growth of just 1% in the second quarter. Service sector confidence has slumped to the lowest since 2009 alongside ongoing woes in the energy and manufacturing sectors, as well as worries about the outlook amid presidential election uncertainty. Hiring has also slowed, though remains surprisingly upbeat. The surveys signal non-farm payroll growth of 150,000 in June, suggesting many companies expect the slowdown to be short-lived.\u201d US markets have opened down, as the Brexit gloom enveloping European investors ripples across the Atlantic. Dow Jones: -0.3% at 17,796 S&amp;P 500: -0.3% at 2,082 Nasdaq: -0.5% at 4,798 Tesco is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 on the back of speculation that a vicious supermarket price war is about to break out, hurting profits in the sector. Tesco is down 9% at 160p while Morrisons shares are down 6.6% at 174p. Sainsbury\u2019s is down 3.6% at 215p. It followed a note by HSBC analyst David McCarthy, who highlighted comments made by David Cheesewright, the head of international operations at Walmart, the US retail giant and Asda owner. Cheesewright told shareholders that he would prioritise sales volume over profit, McCarthy said, signalling that Asda will slash prices in an attempt to keep customers coming through its doors. McCarthy said: If Asda does reposition fundamentally, then it could seriously damage sector profitability. If Asda decided to invest half its margin into price, a competitor reaction could wipe out almost all industry profitability and would force an industry restructure. Our full story here: Sir Howard Davies, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, was on the radio this morning admitting that it would be difficult to overlook the bank\u2019s share price when making decisions about selling off the 73% stake the taxpayer still owns. Just a few hours later, the prospects appear to have diminished even further: the bank\u2019s shares have slumped to 148p, the lowest price at which they have traded since January 2009. That month is significant: January 2009 was one of the grimmest moments of the banking crisis - at least when it comes to the share prices of Britain\u2019s banks. On January 20th that year RBS sunk to 103p (on January 20). These days the concern is more about the ability of RBS to generate revenue and make distributions to shareholders rather than whether it can survive. Even so, the share price is well below the 502p average price at which taxpayers bought their stake in the bank and below the 250p it was trading at before the referendum result was known. The other bailed out bank - Lloyds Banking Group - is also sinking. Its shares are below 50p - compared with a breakeven price of 73.6p. Not everyone is gloomy about the UK economy post-Brexit vote. Mark Price, the UK trade and investment minister and former Waitrose boss, is very upbeat about Britain\u2019s future. Speaking on an official visit to Hong Kong and China, Lord Price said the outcome of the referendum handed the UK and rest of the world the opportunity \u201cto create a second Elizabethan Golden Age\u201d of trade and investment. A fresh start gives a unique opportunity to shape a bright future for the UK as a global trading nation and open economy. The key message is that we have a strong economy: we remain a fantastic place to invest, and have plenty of innovative, successful businesses. I have every confidence we will make this work. I\u2019m optimistic about the future: particularly in helping create a second Elizabethan Golden Age. The first Golden Age was based on peace, prosperity, new trading markets and a flourishing of the arts. The prize that now awaits us is a continued close trading relationship with Europe... There\u2019s also a prospect for striking new deals with Canada, New Zealand and Australia which could form the beginning of a Commonwealth trading pact. The exciting prospect of continuing trading relations with Europe and enhancing trading relationships East and West provides the UK with an opportunity to be a super connected trading hub. Reinforcing democracy, British rule of law, and tolerance through these enhanced business connections is how we will build trust which in turn leads to peace and prosperity. I am optimistic that we can seize the opportunity to create a second Elizabethan Golden Age. Turning to commercial property, the central London office market is most exposed to waning demand from tenants post-Brexit vote according economists at Capital Economics. And dwindling demand for space means falling office rents. Given that the UK\u2019s post- Brexit arrangement is subject to massive uncertainty, leasing activity is likely to be subdued in the short-term. We cut our forecasts for City and West End rental values at the end of 2017 by 5% and 3% respectively. They say capital values in the central London office market might drop anywhere between 3% and 10% over the next four years. The French Prime Minister has told the country\u2019s finance industry that France will be more attractive for companies following Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Parking his tank on the City of London\u2019s lawn, Manuel Valls said he wanted Paris to be Europe\u2019s top financial centre. The sharp drop in the value of the pound will not necessarily mean higher prices in store according to Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s. There has been lots of speculation that prices will rise following the Brexit vote, mainly because a weaker pound makes imports into the country more expensive, and Britain is a net importer. But speaking at Sainsbury\u2019s annual meeting, Coupe told the supermarket\u2019s shareholders: It is not certain we will see inflationary pressures passed on to customers. It is difficult to judge how it will play out. Things may change in the future, commodity prices could come down, exchange rates could change. Europe\u2019s stock markets are suffering a chunky selloff, as the sight of the pound falling through $1.30 this morning spooks investors. Every index is now down, including the FTSE 100 \u2013 despite the boost which weak sterling gives to international companies. Here\u2019s the damage: In London, supermarket chain Tesco has now lost 7% as analysts predict a new price war. Morrisons are down 6%, and Sainsbury are off 5%. IAG, the airline group that owns British Airways, is down 6.5% after analysts at Barclays predicted that companies will cut back on premium travel. And the building firms are still in the red too. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: After a poor start the markets looked increasingly uglier as Wednesday progressed, the widespread losses once again driven by the pound. Down over half a percent against both the dollar and the euro sterling is continuing to feel the post-Brexit pinch this morning, falling far enough that even the FTSE 100, previously buoyed by the prospect of cheaper exports, is starting to suffer. Having crept 0.3% higher soon after the bell the UK index has now fallen nearly 1%, pushed lower by the banking and housing stocks. The sudden closure of Aviva, Standard Life and M&amp;G\u2019s property funds this week have been a painful lesson for some investors. All three were \u2018open-ended\u2019 funds, which allow investors to take out their money at short notice (rather than only during fixed windows). So, the fund managers need to keep plenty of cash to hand to cover redemptions, and can be forced to lock the gates if many investors try to cash in at once. As happened this week. Naomi Heaton of asset management firm LCP explains how open-ended funds can become a \u201cliquidity trap\u201d \u201cWhilst open-ended funds, such as Aviva, purport to offer liquidity, in a falling market these funds suspend redemptions when investors rush to withdraw money, with disastrous consequences. Closed-end funds do not have this problem as investors come in with a medium term horizon and do not bank on a speedy exit.\u201d An alternative option is a \u201creal estate investment trust; a company which owns property assets. Readers may feel that we\u2019ve been reporting new 31-year lows for the pound for weeks. And they\u2019d be right. As this chart shows, sterling has slumped to a series of three-decade lows since the referendum vote. Every fresh weakness has taken us back to levels last seen in early 1985. At the end of February 1985, the pound hit $1.052 against the US dollar. So, if we go through that level, it\u2019s a record low. The sterling crisis of the mid-1980s was one of the key economic moments of the Thatcher government. Chancellor Geoffrey Howe started the ball rolling in 1979 when he relaxed capital controls (after many years in which the Treasury tried to keep the pound stronger than the markets liked). With the economy in recession, Howe cut interest rates (and also hiked taxes in the famous/notorious 1981 budget). Investors voted with their feet, and by 1984 the pound was ploughing towards parity with the US dollar for the first time ever. Quite a reversal, given one pound was worth more than four dollars during the Gold Standard years (Winston Churchill blundered by putting the UK back onto the Standard at the old rate after World War One). The chart shows the pound/dollar rate over the last two centuries: But the sterling crisis of 1985 wasn\u2019t all down to the UK. Over in America, the Federal Reserve had hiked interest rates as Fed chair Paul Volcker tried to tame inflation. He succeeded, perhaps too well, sending the dollar soaring against other currencies. The Fed slashed rates, in vain, and by 1985 drastic action was needed. The US, the UK, France, West Germany and Japan agreed to intervene in the markets to weaken the US dollar - creating the Plaza Accord. That plan worked, sending the pound back up against the US dollar. But while America benefitted from a more competitive exchange rate, other nations suffered. So two years later the five countries plus Canada met at the Louvre in Paris to agree to push the US dollar up again. This chart, from Zerohedge, has more info (click here for a large version) Another Brexit job opportunity.... Tough gig. But perhaps a perfect role for Boris Johnson, now he doesn\u2019t have to run the country after all.... Accountancy firm KPMG has appointed its first ever \u201cHead of Brexit\u201d, after seeing several big deals frozen following the referendum result. Karen Briggs, a KPMG partner, is planning to build a dedicated team to help clients navigate through the stormy waters ahead, in the short and long term. Briggs explains that some clients are hoping to profit from the Brexit vote: We have been advising our clients to consider the next two weeks, two months and two years to assess the path ahead. Looking at our 2:2:2 model, many of our clients have been seeking advice on their immediate risks. However, we are now seeing clients look further ahead to what opportunities might lie ahead in the next two years \u2013 whether these are bolstering trading relationships with China or out-manoeuvring competitors. We are also engaging international clients and are observing, interestingly, predatory intentions from other European nations considering what competitive advantage a Brexit might mean for them. Briggs also reports that Brexit has already forced some mergers to be suspended. We are the largest M&amp;A adviser by volume and we have seen half a dozen deals we are working on put on hold in the wake of the vote outcome. Whether this is a short-term wobble or has more lasting ramifications remains to be seen at this stage.\u201d Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index has now fallen by 1.1% today, or 177 points to 15,557, as investors continue to bail out of UK companies. That means the 250 index has now shed more than 10% of its value since the vote on June 23rd. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said yesterday that the FTSE 250 is a good gauge of market sentiment towards the UK, so the recent slump in valuations is a concern. The index slumped by 13% in the two days after the vote, before bounding back. But it\u2019s been sliding all week, as Brexit gloom has deepened. The biggest fallers today include new \u2018challenger banks\u2019, Metro and Aldermore, who will suffer if Britain falls into recession. DFS, the furniture group, have fallen by 7%. Its sales could suffer if nervous consumers decide to spend and borrow less. CLS Holdings, a property management firm, is also under the cosh, reflecting worries that Britain\u2019s commercial property market is being hit by Brexit fears. It\u2019s such a contrast with the internationally focused FTSE 100, which is actually up since the referendum (because the weak pound has boosted companies who sell overseas) The drop in UK car sales in June is worrying, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. He fears that consumers are going to rein in their spending, despite the Bank of England encouraging banks to boost their lending. While fleet sales were resilient in June, there will be the worry for the car sector that fleet operators could increasingly delay and reduce replacement of their existing cars in a more uncertain and weaker economic environment. Meanwhile, the car sector must have serious concerns that consumers will cut back on buying new cars as a more uncertain environment hits confidence and undermines willingness to make big ticket purchases. There is widespread suspicion \u2013 including at the Bank of England - that heightened uncertainty following the vote to leave the European Union will particularly hit sales of big-ticket items such as cars and houses.There is also the significant possibly that the fundamentals for consumers will deteriorate appreciable over the coming months. This chart from Bloomberg shows how the pound suffered significant tumbles against other currencies since the referendum on June 23rd. Here\u2019s our updated news story on the pound\u2019s latest tumble against the US dollar, by Angela Monaghan: UK car sales fell last month, for only the second time in four years. New figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Trades shows that 255,766 new vehicles were registered in June, 0.8% fewer than in June 2015. It may signal that consumers become more cautious about big spending decisions around the time of the referendum, or that the economy was slowing anyway. It\u2019s the first monthly fall since last October, and the first fall in any June since 2011. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, wants the government to take action to support the industry: \u201cIt is far too soon to determine whether the referendum result has had an impact on the new car market. The first six months saw strong demand at record levels but the market undoubtedly cooled over the second quarter. It\u2019s important government takes every measure to restore business and economic confidence to avoid the market contracting in the coming months. City economists are concerned by sterling\u2019s wobble overnight, and fear there is worse to come in next few months. Andrew Edwards, CEO of trading firm ETX Capital, says investors are reacting to M&amp;G Investments, Aviva and Standard Life freezing their UK property funds. Investors are now nervously casting their eyes around for other funds that may shutter. The negative effect on sentiment in the investment market will underpin sterling weakness. Pessimistic predictions for sterling are coming true. The pound is the chief proxy for the post-Brexit mood in the markets. Sterling is bearing the brunt of market stress, in sharp contrast to the FTSE 100, which is holding firm because 75% or so of earnings comes from overseas and because of heavy weighting towards the big international groups on the index. The question is: how long can this last if more funds start pulling the plug?\u201d Andy Scott of currency firm HiFX fears that political instability will hurt the pound: \u201cThe fears over Brexit are quickly being realised with an initial heavy selloff following the shock result, followed by this second wave of investors who held their nerve initially, but are now deciding that they\u2019d rather accept the losses so far than risk losing more. Clearly Mark Carney and George Osborne believe there are very rough times ahead for the UK economy as they begin rolling out a number of measures to cushion the potential impact. The Pound is now clearly seen as a high risk asset and when market sentiment becomes very risk averse, it will come under pressure as seen over the past two days. Sweden\u2019s central bank has been forced to tear up its plans to raise interest rates this year, thanks to the UK\u2019s EU referendum. The Riksbank just announced that future rate hikes have been \u201cpostponed\u201d, as it must now focus on protecting the Swedish economy from Brexit fallout. There is considerable uncertainty over economic developments abroad and this has increased as a consequence of the result of the British referendum on the EU. A highly expansionary monetary policy is needed to provide support to the Swedish economy and rising inflation. Fears of a property slowdown following the Brexit vote are hitting the shares of British banks and building firms again. The big fallers on the FTSE 100 include many construction firms and financial stocks, as investors worry that the UK economy could suffer a recession. Supermarket firms are also down, after new data showed food prices fell again last month (good for consumers, but bad for profits). The FTSE 100 itself is actually up 20 points, or 0.3%, thanks to international companies such as miners (whose earnings are often in dollars). But the smaller FTSE 250 index, which is more UK-focused, has shed 0.4% this morning. It\u2019s already lost 9% since the EU referendum. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says: It\u2019s an uneasy start in London with the waning pound no longer seemingly sufficient to deliver any meaningful upside for stocks. GBP/USD is now below 1.30 as expectations build that we\u2019ll see a rate cut from the Bank of England. The pound\u2019s latest slump came hours after Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that the risks of Brexit were beginning to crystallise.... On the night of the EU referendum, the pound hit the giddy heights of $1.50 against the dollar. Now, though, most economists reckon it will languish below $1.30 for the rest of the year. Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s share price has taken a battering since the referendum, losing more than 30% to just 155p. That\u2019s far below the 502p at which taxpayers would break even on their 73% stake, acquired during the 2008 crisis. Sir Howard Davies, the bank\u2019s chairman, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning that that \u201crealistically\u201d this means the government it not going to be able to sell off the rest any time soon. \u201cOne can deduce it will be later than sooner,\u201d Davies said, admitting \u201cyou cannot ignore the share price\u201d. Chancellor George Osborne had set himself a goal to sell off most the stake by the end his parliament \u2013 2020 \u2013 but as Davies said, this is something for the new government to decide. He explained the share price by saying: \u201cif you are a major UK bank you can\u2019t ignore what\u2019s going in the UK economy\u201d. Davies was among those bank bossed called to see Chancellor George Osborne yesterday, who asked them about the conditions they were experiencing in their branches. He said it was \u201cnot so bad\u201d but that there had been a slowdown in property. Like others, Davies is trying to get across that banks are open for business, not as they were in 2008 when banks had to hunker down and amass capital to try to survive the turmoil. This is what governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney had said yesterday and Davies said he agreed his view that it was an issue of demand for credit rather than supply. The value of the pound could also affect RBS as it expecting a huge penalty from the US authorities for the way it packaged up bonds during the subprime mortgage crisis almost 10 years ago. Davies appeared to admit that RBS had taken some protection in the currency markets in anticipation of the fine. It was not clear how much protection RBS had bought but some analysts have said this penalty could reach up to \u00a38bn. Brexit worries hits the Asian stock markets overnight. Japan\u2019s Nikkei led the selloff, down almost 2%. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say: The Brexit fall-out continues to weigh on global markets. Most stock markets in Asia were down substantially. What caused the pound to slide below $1.30? Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit blames Aviva, M&amp;G and Standard Life for freezing their property funds. They all blocked redemptions, after a surge of investors tried to pull their money out following the Brexit vote. We\u2019ll be watching to see if other funds follow today.... Britain\u2019s national prestige has taken a knock, thanks to the weakening pound. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Brexit fears continue to rampage through the markets. While most of us were sleeping, the pound slumped to fresh 31-year lows in Asian trading, toppling to just $1.28 against the US dollar. The rout came after another day of drama yesterday, with three UK property funds refusing to allow investors to take their money out. Wall Street bank Goldman added to the pressure by predicting that the pound would keep weakening through the summer: And fears of a Brexit-induced recession have hit the share prices of UK companies hard. CMC Market\u2019s Michael Hewson sums up the mood: The pound has continued to come under pressure in the past couple of days sinking to new 31 year lows around the 1.2800 level against the US dollar and multi-year lows against the yen and the euro as well. The suspension of commercial property fund redemptions by a number of big players has precipitated a broader sell off in the UK property sector including house builders and other asset managers. Combined with a warning that some Brexit effects were already starting to crystallise and this week\u2019s slowdown in recent economic data we\u2019ve seen a bit of a domino effect in locally exposed sterling assets, as well as risky assets generally across the world. While some have speculated that some \u201cLeave\u201d voters may have undergone some form of buyer\u2019s remorse in the wake of the volatility of the UK Brexit vote outcome, it would seem that the same could also be said of the investors who took part in last week\u2019s stock market rebound in the aftermath of the said vote. So it could be another dramatic day.

Investors voted with their feet, and by 1984 the pound was ploughing towards parity with the US dollar for the first time ever.</p> <p>Quite a reversal, given one pound was worth more than four dollars during the Gold Standard years (Winston Churchill blundered by putting the UK back onto the Standard at the old rate after World War One).</p> <p>The chart shows the pound/dollar rate over the last two centuries:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/748137482013786112\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">An illustrated history of the pound sterling 1791-2016: <a href=\"https://t.co/8BFTi0nvgM\">pic.twitter.com/8BFTi0nvgM</a></p>&mdash; Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/748137482013786112\">June 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But the sterling crisis of 1985 wasn\u2019t all down to the UK.

The Fed slashed rates, in vain, and by 1985 drastic action was needed. The US, the UK, France, West Germany and Japan agreed to intervene in the markets to weaken the US dollar - creating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_Accord\">the Plaza Accord</a>. </p> <p>That plan worked, sending the pound back up against the US dollar.</p> <p>But while America benefitted from a more competitive exchange rate, other nations suffered.

      "bodyText": "More than \u00a31.6bn has been slashed from the value of the UK\u2019s three biggest publicly listed supermarkets after a respected analyst warned that Asda is preparing to fire the first salvo in a summer price war that could \u201cwipe out\u201d its rivals\u2019 profits. Tesco\u2019s shares slid by 8%, Sainsbury\u2019s was down almost 4%, and Morrisons fell more than 7%, after the HSBC analyst David McCarthy issued a dire warning about supermarkets\u2019 prospects. McCarthy pointed to comments made by David Cheesewright, the head of international operations at the US retail titan Walmart, which owns Asda. Last month, Cheesewright told shareholders he would prioritise sales volume over profit, signalling that Asda will slash prices in an attempt to keep customers coming through its doors. Since then, it has been announced that Asda\u2019s long-serving chief executive, Andy Clarke, will step down at the end of this month. He is being replaced by Sean Clarke, a former Asda employee who most recently ran Walmart\u2019s Chinese business, potentially signalling a change in strategy. In a note titled \u201cDefcon 1\u201d issued on Wednesday, McCarthy said: \u201cIf Asda decided to invest half its margin into price, a competitor reaction could wipe out almost all industry profitability and would force an industry restructure.\u201d Asda enjoys a higher profit margin than most rivals, meaning it can cut prices aggressively before it stops making money. This could force other supermarkets with smaller profit margins to follow suit and sacrifice profits to maintain market share, he said. \u201cIf Asda does reposition fundamentally, then it could seriously damage sector profitability,\u201d said McCarthy. He downgraded Tesco\u2019s and Morrison\u2019s stock as analysts at Redburn also issued a note downgrading Tesco shares to a sell, after slashing its estimate of the fair value of the supermarket\u2019s stock by half. Redburn analysts James Tracey and Emily Want said new analysis suggested there needed to be a 20% to 30% cut in store space for the major supermarkets to increase their profit margins by the amount currently expected by the City. They said any increase in food price commodities as a result of the falling value of the pound following the vote to leave the EU was likely to be offset by supermarkets\u2019 need to keep prices low in the face of rising competition from cafes and restaurants and a slowing UK economy. Amid rising competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl and commodity price deflation, food prices have been falling for more than three years. Grocery prices fell a further 0.8% in June, according to the British Retail Consortium-Nielsen Shop Price Index. While some forecasters are predicting that food prices will start rising again due to the pound\u2019s weakness after the EU referendum result, a price war could limit the impact on consumers. McCarthy said any price cuts by Asda would be aimed at arresting a decline in sales by restoring its image as the value option on the high street. The retailer has found its price position undermined by the fast-expanding discounters who offer considerably cheaper prices on the narrow range of goods they offer. Asda has also come under pressure from the rise in online shopping and switch away from the kind of large supermarkets it operates to small local stores. Asda has cut prices in the past year, but Aldi and Lidl have pledged to maintain the differential by cutting their prices too. The two discounters now control more than 10% of UK grocery sales and are seeing double-digit sales growth as Asda\u2019s sales continue to slide. McCarthy, who said he expected Asda to cut prices before the end of summer, added that it would be difficult for Walmart, the world\u2019s largest company by revenues, to back down. \u201cIf Asda does nothing now, and sales continue to decline, [Walmart] International management would lose credibility.\u201d The analysts\u2019 comments come after other analysts suggested any price cuts by Asda would only serve to bring it more in line with the rest of the industry. \u201cThere is as much about catch up than any new industry pricing paradigm from Asda to us,\u201d analysts at Shore Capital wrote in a note. They suggested that Asda\u2019s poor performance relative to its peers was as much to do with uninspiring, poor quality groceries as price and that it would take time for the chain to improve its overall offer. Shore Capital added: \u201cWe believe that Aldi and Lidl should have more worry lines about Asda getting its act together, should it do so, than any other organisation in the trade.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "MPs investigating the demise of BHS want one of the City\u2019s leading regulators to broaden its own inquiry into the scandal. The chairmen of the joint parliamentary committee have called for the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) to investigate the work done by the accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on auditing BHS and the rest of Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail empire. The FRC announced last week that it plans to explore the conduct of PwC during its audit of BHS\u2019s accounts in the year to 30 August 2014, the last full year it was controlled by Green. However, MPs want the regulator to examine the previous years, when PwC audited BHS and the accountancy firm\u2019s audits of other companies in Green\u2019s empire that were interlinked with the collapsed retailer. The investigation is likely to focus on why PwC signed off BHS as a going concern when it was reliant on support from its parent company, Taveta, which is the Green family\u2019s investment firm. BHS collapsed into administration in April, putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Green and his wife, Lady Green, controlled BHS for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to a consortium led by Dominic Chappell, who has been declared bankrupt three times. Green and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rental payments and interest during the Greens\u2019 period in charge. Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions then collected at least \u00a317m from BHS, despite owning it for just 13 months. MPs on the work and pensions committee and the business, innovation and skills committee are investigating how the BHS pension scheme ended up heavily in deficit and why Green sold the company to Chappell. Frank Field and Iain Wright, the chairmen of the two committees, said in their letter: \u201cWe welcome the FRC\u2019s announcement of an investigation into the conduct of PwC with regards to its audit of BHS accounts in the year ending August 2014. \u201cWe do, however, have concerns that the scope of this investigation is too narrow, and urge you to considering widening its scope to cover previous years when PwC audited BHS financial statements and signed the company off as a going concern, and PwC audits of the accounts of other Taveta group companies with which the finances of BHS were interlinked. \u201cWe also urge you to set a deadline for concluding your investigation and clarify what steps you intend to take to ensure the FRC\u2019s independence in conducting these important duties.\u201d The FRC is one of a number of bodies investigating the collapse of BHS. The Pensions Regulator is exploring whether Green should be forced to pump money into the pension scheme, while the Insolvency Service is investigating whether there are grounds to disqualify the directors of the retailer for their conduct. The Serious Fraud Office is also considering whether there are grounds to launch a formal investigation.",

The Pensions Regulator is exploring whether Green should be forced to pump money into the pension scheme, while the Insolvency Service is investigating whether there are grounds to disqualify the directors of the retailer for their conduct. </p> <p>The Serious Fraud Office is also considering whether there are grounds to launch a formal investigation. <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The United States has surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia as the global leader in oil reserves, according to a report by a Norwegian consultancy firm. \u201cWe have done this benchmarking every year, and this is the first year we\u2019ve seen that the US is above Saudi Arabia and Russia,\u201d Per Magnus Nysveen, head of analysis at Rystad Energy, said. He credited the rise to a sharp increase in the number of discoveries in the Permian basin in Texas over the past two years. The report found that many, especially members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, exaggerated the size of their reserves in self-reported surveys. Rystad Energy came to the conclusion by only recording each country\u2019s economically viable reserves. Rystad found that the US had 264bn barrels of oil in reserve, ahead of Russia at 256bn barrels and Saudi Arabia at 212bin barrels. The study also painted a grim picture for the future of oil globally. A press release accompanying the findings said, at the current rate of production oil supplies will only last 70 more years, while the number of cars will double in the next 30 years. With this in mind, the release added, \u201cit becomes very clear oil alone cannot satisfy the growing need for individual transport\u201d. Electric cars currently make up a small portion of global car sales. Nysveen predicts that in 30 years, that portion will grow in Western countries but it will remain unfeasible in places where access to electricity is difficult. American oil reserves have grown dramatically in the past two years due to improvements in technology for extracting shale. Increased productivity has cut the cost of extracting oil in half in the past two years, when compared to the price per barrel. The process of extracting shale, known as fracking, has drawn sharp criticisms from environmentalists in the past for its excessive use of water, contamination of wells and potentially causing cancer for nearby residents. It became more prominently used when the price of oil surged in the early 2000s, making the practice economically feasible. Despite the large reserves, the US oil market has been badly bruised by the recent drop in oil prices. Several oil companies have filed for bankruptcy in the past year, and the knock-on effects for related industries, like steel, has been devastating. Tens of thousands of jobs have been lost due to oversupply in the global market bringing the price down. Nysveen is forecasting the price of the barrel to bottom out soon as supply is beginning to rebalance. \u201cAt the end of the year, we will see increases again in US oil production,\u201d he said. The US lifted its 40-year ban on exporting oil in December last year. Despite oil and gas companies getting routed by low oil prices, some states, such as Panama, are hoping to capitalize on its new status. \u201cOne of the first exports from the United States passed through the existing Panama Canal to Nicaragua,\u201d said Manuel Ben\u00edtez, deputy administrator at the Panama Canal Authority. Refined oil products from the US traveling through the canal have been making their way to Chile, Ecuador and Peru. Nysveen also sees the future implications of the larger reserves as positive for the US economy. As the world\u2019s largest consumer of oil, the reserves will help cut America\u2019s trade deficit and strengthen the dollar, Nysveen said. Geopolitically speaking, the large reserves will prevent oil from being used as a political tool against the United States as it can remain self-sufficient, he added.",

The number of cars sold dropped 0.8% to 255,766 last month, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. It was the first monthly fall since October, when a 1.1% decline in sales brought to an end a record 43 consecutive months of growth. For the month of June, it was the first fall in five years. Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said it was too early to tell what impact the vote to leave the EU would have on car sales, but said the government must do all it could to shore up confidence. \u201cIt is far too soon to determine whether the referendum result has had an impact on the new car market. The first six months saw strong demand at record levels but the market undoubtedly cooled over the second quarter. \u201cIt\u2019s important the government takes every measure to restore business and economic confidence to avoid the market contracting in the coming months.\u201d Consumer confidence fell sharply immediately after the result of the 23 June referendum was known, according to a YouGov/Cebr poll. \u201cIn the coming months this is likely to filter through into a much weaker environment for retail sales and household spending \u2013 particularly on big ticket items,\u201d the pollsters said. British consumers appeared to have an insatiable appetite for new cars over recent years as buyers were attracted by cheap finance deals for more fuel efficient models. Aside from sales, there are fears that car manufacturing could take a hit from the Brexit vote, with foreign companies delaying investment decisions or choosing other locations to open factories. The UK car industry has traditionally benefited from strong investment from overseas car manufacturers, including Nissan in Sunderland and Toyota in Derby. Companies committed to invest a total of \u00a32.5bn in UK car production last year alone. The top three most popular cars in June were the Ford Fiesta, the Vauxhall Corsa and the Ford Focus. Over the first six months of 2016, new UK car sales were up 3.2%, with 1.42m registrations between January and June, the strongest half-year performance on record. The SMMT is forecasting that 2.703m new cars will be sold in 2016, up 1% on 2015.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pound sank to a fresh 31-year low against the dollar on Wednesday amid growing signs that the shock Brexit vote is already damaging the UK economy. Sterling hit a low of $1.2796 at one point as investors lost confidence in Britain\u2019s future outside the European Union and piled out of the UK currency. The last time the pound was lower was in June 1985, but it has still got a way to fall before hitting its all time low against the dollar of $1.0520, struck on 1 March 1985. Sterling has plunged almost 15% since a poll published on 23 June \u2013 the day of the referendum \u2013 wrongly indicated Britain had voted to stay in the EU, pushing the UK currency above $1.50. The pound also fell to a near three-year low against the euro at \u20ac1.1741. On the stock market, there were fresh falls for housebuilders, which have been hard hit since the referendum result, and the suspension of three major commercial property funds. M&amp;G Investments and Aviva Investors barred investors from withdrawing cash from their property funds on Tuesday amid fears of a crash in the commercial property market and Standard Life made the same move a day earlier. In early trading on Wednesday Barratt Developments was leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down by over 5%, while Taylor Wimpey fell 4%. The FTSE 100 was up 0.3%, at 6563, but the more UK-focused FTSE 250 index was down again, falling 0.5% to 15660. Sterling\u2019s slide came amid worrying signs the UK economy is already suffering from the Brexit vote.A closely watched survey published on Tuesday showed growth in the UK services sector \u2013 which accounts for more than three quarters of the economy \u2013 was the slowest in three years in June. Companies reported \u201cintensified\u201d anxiety in the runup to the referendum. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cThe pound has continued to come under pressure in the past couple of days sinking to new 31 year lows. \u201cThe suspension of commercial property fund redemptions by a number of big players has precipitated a broader sell off in the UK property sector including house builders and other asset managers. \u201cCombined with a warning that some Brexit effects were already starting to crystallise and this week\u2019s slowdown in recent economic data we\u2019ve seen a bit of a domino effect in locally exposed sterling assets, as well as risky assets generally across the world.\u201d The pound also fell against the Japanese yen on Wednesday, hitting a three-and-a-half year low of 128.81 yen. Concerns about the impact on already fragile global growth spread to commodity markets. After oil prices shed 5% on Tuesday, Brent crude fell further on Wednesday to $47.57 a barrel, before recovering slightly to go back above $48. Investors rushed to safe-haven sovereign debt and took markets deeper into unknown territory. Yields on US Treasuries, the benchmark for bonds worldwide, hit record lows out to 30 years. Investors had to pay Japan 0.27% to lend it money for 10 years. \u201cThere\u2019s no inflation prospects, there\u2019s no strong growth. The only thing we have is uncertainty,\u201d said Hiroko Iwaki, senior bond strategist at Mizuho Securities. In Japan, the Nikkei fell 1.9% to 15,379, as concerns over the Brexit vote continued to be felt further afield. Since Britain\u2019s shock vote to exit the EU two weeks ago, investors have been consoling themselves with the expectation of yet more policy easing from the major central banks. Yet analysts, and many at the banks themselves, have warned that the scope for manoeuvre is strictly limited and any new steps could prove counter-productive. \u201cFinancial markets appear to have taken a more realistic view around the complexity and uncertainty characterising the global political background and its impact on already lacklustre economic growth,\u201d wrote analysts at ANZ in a note. \u201cThis suggests the tug-a-war between more central bank support and economic fundamentals is going to increase, driving market volatility.\u201d Dealers said there was no one event behind the moves but rather an accumulation of negative factors. And in Italy, shares in its banks tumbled, shaking the financial foundations of the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy. \u201cItaly faces a severe crisis that is exponential. This is not gradual and not linear,\u201d said Francesco Galietti, head of the Policy Sonar risk consultancy and a former finance ministry official. \u201cThe immediate trigger is the banking crisis.\u201d",

Alberts began as a family-run publishing company founded by a Swiss clockmaker in Sydney in 1884 before expanding to become a multi-functioning label, including a studio, publishing and management company, and home to the successful writer-producer team Harry Vanda and George Young. Other Alberts artists included John Paul Young, The Easybeats, Flash &amp; The Pan, Stevie Wright, Rose Tattoo, The Angels, Ted Mulry Gang, Megan Washington, Montaigne, San Cisco, The Cat Empire, Josh Pyke, Urthboy, The Delta Riggs and Paul Grabowsky. Under the new deal, the Albert family will retain their interests in the catalogues of AC/DC and Vanda, Young and Wright and BMG will administer the music publishing catalogues worldwide. Alberts chairman, Robert Albert, said: \u201cThese songwriters were an integral part of my late brother Ted Albert\u2019s vision to take Australia\u2019s music to the world. Retaining these catalogues will allow us to stay connected with an industry that has been an integral part of our lives for the last 131 years.\u201d Alberts CEO, David Albert, said: \u201cThis was a difficult decision to make, but as music grapples with its digital future, with new distribution models and the influence of global technology companies, we believe BMG is in the best position to take the business forward.\u201d BMG CEO, Hartwig Masuch, said the deal meant Australian artists and songwriters wishing to tap into the world market now had \u201ca genuine alternative\u201d to the major established record labels. \u201cBMG is very serious about the Australian market and this deal is an indication of our commitment.\u201d \u2022 Australian Associated Press contributed to this report",
