      "bodyText": "It is ironic indeed that China is in talks about a $2bn (\u00a31.3bn) purchase of a gold producer, African Barrick, whose value has been hammered down at least in part by the lack of confidence surrounding the Chinese economy. Cash-rich companies from the People's Republic are in a perfect position to snap up mining assets around the world that are being driven into retrenchment by a slowdown in Chinese demand for all kinds of coal, ore and minerals. Some of this slowdown results from deliberate policies by the government in Beijing, but it would take a heroic conspiracy theorist to believe these were being pursued so that more commodity firms can be hoovered up by China on the cheap. Certainly in the case of African Barrick Gold, the share price is down well below its 2010 float on the London stock market. But demand for gold in China is still growing \u2013 partly as a hedge against falls in other investments. There is no doubt that China's first-half GDP growth of 7.8% \u2013 its lowest level in three years \u2013 is causing a huge slump in the price of most commodities, and severe pain for the miners who benefited so much from China's previously soaring demand. Some coal prices recently hit a two-year low and BHP Billiton said on Thursday that increasing costs and falling prices meant \"clearly there may be some impact on jobs in some areas\" of its Australian coal operations. The company, which is expected to unveil its first profit fall in three years next week, has abandoned an $80bn five-year spending plan that it unveiled less than a year ago when commodity prices were still flying high. Last week Rio Tinto said it would be closing the Blair Athol coal mine in Queensland before the end of the year with the loss of 140 jobs, and reported a 22% slump in first half-profits to $5bn compared with the same period last year.

Together, the phone company and bank share deals accounted for 41% of the total volume on the FTSE 100 today. And in case that was not evidence enough as to just how quiet the markets are, just 20 companies from the entire London market (FTSE 100, 250, AIM etc) reported that their directors have bought or sold shares. Most notable was former Marks and Spencer head of clothing, Kate Bostock, cashing in her 2009 performance-related shares bonus which were released in June worth \u00a3434,890. She also sold a further \u00a3441,045 worth of shares at the same time (boldly informing the stock market of both transactions at 4.25pm in the same announcement). It means the former director \u2013 who left M&amp;S recently after women's fashion sales slumped \u2013 pocketed a cool \u00a3876,000. Company news was thin on the ground. Barrick Gold confirmed it is in talks to sell a majority stake in its African unit to Chine National Gold and would make it China's largest mining deal in Africa. Shares closed up 31.4p, 8%, at 425.1p.",

      "bodyText": "Petrol price cuts by supermarkets and bargain offers in the high street prompted a rise in retail sales last month. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed a 0.3% increase in the volume of sales, defying City expectations that poor July weather would cause a small drop in spending. The ONS also revised up its estimate of retail sales in June to show a monthly rise of 0.8%, prompting speculation that the economy might be growing more strongly than had been thought. Officials had previously pencilled in an increase in June sales of just 0.1% when they published second quarter growth figures showing a 0.7% decline in national output. The ONS said the better-than-expected performance of the high street in July had been largely due to cut-price fuel deals from supermarkets. Without this boost to spending, retail sales would have been flat. The July data included only two days of the Olympics - 27 and 28 July - and the ONS said feedback from retailers suggests there was no impact on sales from the Games last month. \"If there is to be any evidence of an 'Olympic effect' lifting the economy, we should expect to see that in next month's figures,\" said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange company World First. He added: \"The fact that the rise came from fuel sales emphasises the fact that problems persist on the high street. Both sport and leisurewear retailers have failed to capitalise on either Euro 2012 or Wimbledon this year. \"The landscape for retail sales will continue to 'bump along the bottom' throughout H2, as the pressure on wages from inflation reduces the propensity of people to spend money on anything but the bare essentials.\" Price pressure in the high street fell to its lowest level in almost three years as retailers sought to attract customers. The measure used by the ONS to measure inflation in the retail trade rose by 0.2% in the year to July. James Knightley at ING said the July numbers were \"pretty encouraging, especially with decent upward revisions to June. Together with Wednesday's firm looking jobs numbers we continue to have doubts about the message from GDP report, suggesting the UK is in a deepening recession.\"",

      "body": "<p>Petrol price cuts by supermarkets and bargain offers in the high street prompted a rise in retail sales last month.</p> <p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed a 0.3% increase in the volume of sales, defying City expectations that poor July weather would cause a small drop in spending.</p> <p>The ONS also revised up its estimate of retail sales in June to show a monthly rise of 0.8%, prompting speculation that the economy might be growing more strongly than had been thought.</p> <p>Officials had previously pencilled in an increase in June sales of just 0.1% when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/25/george-osborne-under-pressure-economy\" title=\"\">they published second quarter growth figures showing a 0.7% decline in national output</a>.</p> <p>The ONS said the better-than-expected performance of the high street in July had been largely due to cut-price fuel deals from supermarkets. Without this boost to spending, retail sales would have been flat.</p> <p>The July data included only two days of the Olympics - 27 and 28 July - and the ONS said feedback from retailers suggests there was no impact on sales from the Games last month.</p> <p>\"If there is to be any evidence of an 'Olympic effect' lifting the economy, we should expect to see that in next month's figures,\" said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange company World First.</p> <p>He added: \"The fact that the rise came from fuel sales emphasises the fact that problems persist on the high street. Both sport and leisurewear retailers have failed to capitalise on either Euro 2012 or Wimbledon this year.</p> <p>\"The landscape for retail sales will continue to 'bump along the bottom' throughout H2, as the pressure on wages from inflation reduces the propensity of people to spend money on anything but the bare essentials.\"</p> <p>Price pressure in the high street fell to its lowest level in almost three years as retailers sought to attract customers. The measure used by the ONS to measure inflation in the retail trade rose by 0.2% in the year to July.</p> <p>James Knightley at ING said the July numbers were \"pretty encouraging, especially with decent upward revisions to June. Together with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/15/uk-unemployment-falls-olympics-temporary-jobs\" title=\"\">Wednesday's firm looking jobs numbers</a> we continue to have doubts about the message from GDP report, suggesting the UK is in a deepening recession.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A gentle shrug of the shoulders and nonchalant gaze was about the closest the City gave in response to the threat of US fury over the libor scandal as banking stocks barely moved. Overnight it was revealed that state attorneys in America have subpoenaed several banks, as the muscle-flexing, politically ambitions lawyers continue to lick their lips at the speed in which Standard Chartered capitulated to New York's demands and agreed a $340m fine. In the past, the threat of heavy fines, criminal prosecutions and angry regulators would see more nervous banking investors running for the hills (exhibit A \u2013 Barclays following its recent FSA fine). But if this morning is anything to go by, investors are getting wise to the US tactics and shares remain stable. Barclays is down just 0.3p at 182.8p, HSBC is down 1.3p at 563.5p, Royal Bank of Scotland is up 1.3p at 222.9p and Lloyds is up 0.2p at 32.2p. Overall the FTSE 100 is down just 6 points at 5827 in another quiet day for the markets so far, making it one of the slowest weeks for a long, long time. The various mining and raw material firms that were the biggest losers by low single-digits are now the biggest risers \u2013 again by low single digits. And when the biggest riser, Evraz, is up 2.8% and the biggest faller, cruise boat group Carnival is the biggest faller, is down 1.9%, with the remaining 98 companies floating the the middle, don't expect much action today. Ben Critchley, sales trader at IG Index summed up the quiet markets: In mid-morning trade, the FTSE is fractionally lower, as the August phenomenon of deserted markets grinds on.
