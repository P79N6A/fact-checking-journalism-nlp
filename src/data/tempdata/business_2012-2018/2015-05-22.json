      "bodyText": "The number of mortgage deals on the market has jumped by nearly a fifth in a year to its highest level since the financial crisis. A year after the mortgage market review brought in new affordability checks, the total number of different home loans available in April was up 19% from 11,416 to 13,539, according to data from the Mortgage Advice Bureau. The figures suggest that consumer choice has not been restricted by the new rules and that competition has returned to the market. In the months after the financial crisis began, banks and building societies stopped offering high loan-to-value mortgages and focused on a small range of deals for the most creditworthy borrowers. Returning confidence in the housing market, combined with stimulus schemes such as Help to Buy, have encouraged lenders to offer more deals to those with small deposits. Meanwhile, low interest rates and competition for market share have triggered a mortgage price war. This week Nationwide and TSB both reduced the cost of fixed-rate loans, with some deals cut by 0.3 percentage points, and on Friday Yorkshire building society launched the lowest ever two-year fixed-rate deal. At the same time, lenders have been launching cashback deals to attract first-time buyers. Brian Murphy, head of lending at Mortgage Advice Bureau, said existing lenders were broadening their offerings and moving into new sectors, as well as new lenders pushing into the market. \u201cFor example, new-to-market lenders such as Bank of Ireland for Intermediaries, Pepper Homeloans and Fleet Mortgages, have launched in the past year, and more are bound to come as competition in the mortgage sector intensifies,\u201d he said. \u201cMeanwhile, existing lenders have been strengthening their mortgage proposition in response to the rise of challenger banks.\u201d David Hollingworth of mortgage brokers London &amp; Country said: \u201cThere is not much innovation out there \u2013 lenders are tending to offer straightforward, fixed-rate deals. But that\u2019s not a criticism \u2013 people are looking for good-value mortgages of that type, and that\u2019s what\u2019s out there.\u201d He expected increasing competition to bring wider choice for borrowers. \u201cThe fact that Yorkshire Building Society\u2019s two-year deal is at 1.07% compared with Co-op Bank\u2019s 1.09% deal shows just how intense competition is and how important it is to be at the top of the table,\u201d he said. Mortgage Advice Bureau said there had been a small slowdown in applications for home loans in April, with total cases down by 10% compared to March. However, it said this was partly attributable to the Easter break falling at the beginning of the month, rather than to the general election. \u201cIndustry forecasts for future growth are moderate but positive. Consumer demand is certainly riding high, but our major concern is that housing supply is running dangerously low. The UK is short of enough suitable properties to support potential buyers\u2019 homeowning aspirations, and a housing strategy that will last beyond the current government is desperately needed.\u201d",

Yellen said that if the US economy continues to strengthen, \u201cit will be appropriate at some point this year to take the initial step to raise the federal funds rate\u201d. However, she cautioned the market not to expect any rapid increase in rates. \u201cAfter we begin raising the federal funds rate, I anticipate that the pace of normalization is likely to be gradual,\u201d she said in a speech in Rhode Island on Friday. \u201cThe various headwinds that are still restraining the economy, as I said, will likely take some time to fully abate, and the pace of that improvement is highly uncertain. \u201cWe have no intention of embarking on a pre-set course of increases in the federal funds rate after the initial increase,\u201d she added. Her comments come just a few weeks before the next Federal Reserve policy meeting, on 16-17 June. At the last meeting the committee indicated the central bank was unlikely to raise rates until later in the year, with most economists pencilling in a September rate raise. Yellen said that while the official unemployment rate of 5.4% is approaching what many Federal Reserve officials consider to be consistent with full employment, the jobless rate \u201cprobably does not fully capture the extent of slack in the labor market\u201d. She also expressed disappointment that big US companies are not increasing employees wage cheques as they prosper from the improving economy, and warned that the roughly 2% increase in hourly wages throughout the recovery indicated that \u201cthe labor market has not fully healed\u201d. \u201cThere are at least some encouraging signs of a pickup so far this year,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that some large companies such as Walmart and Target have announced wage increases for their employees also might be a sign that larger wage gains are on the horizon.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Bank of England officials are secretly researching the financial shocks that could hit Britain if there is a vote to leave the European Union in the forthcoming referendum. The Bank blew its cover on Friday when it accidentally emailed details of the project \u2013 including how the bank intended to fend off any inquiries about its work \u2013 direct to the Guardian. According to the confidential email, the press and most staff in Threadneedle Street must be kept in the dark about the work underway, which has been dubbed Project Bookend. It spells out that if anyone asks about the project, the taskforce must say the investigation has nothing to do with the referendum, saying only that staff are involved in examining \u201ca broad range of European economic issues\u201d that concern the Bank. The revelation is likely to embarrass the bank governor, Mark Carney, who has overhauled the central bank\u2019s operations and promised greater transparency over its decision-making. MPs are now likely to ask whether the Bank intended to inform parliament that a major review of Britain\u2019s prospects outside the EU was being undertaken by the institution that acts as the UK\u2019s main financial regulator. Carney is also likely to come under pressure within the Bank to reveal whether there are other undercover projects underway. Officials are likely to have kept the project under wraps to avoid entering the highly charged debate around the EU referendum, which has jumped to the top of the political agenda since the Conservatives secured an overall majority. Many business leaders and pro-EU campaigners have warned that \u201cBrexit\u201d would hit British exports and damage the standing of the City of London. The report could prove incendiary, but without a public notice advertising the Bank\u2019s research project, parliament and the public would be unable to demand its publication. The email indicates that a small group of senior staff are to examine the effect of a Brexit under the authority of Sir Jon Cunliffe, who as deputy director for financial stability has responsibility for monitoring the risk of another market crash. Cunliffe also sits on the board of the City regulator, the Prudential Regulatory Authority. James Talbot, the head of the monetary assessment and strategy division, is involved in Project Bookend, drawing on his past work as an adviser on European economic policy. The email, from Cunliffe\u2019s private secretary to four senior executives, was written on 21 May and forwarded by mistake to a Guardian editor by the Bank\u2019s head of press, Jeremy Harrison. It says: \u201cJon\u2019s proposal, which he has asked me to highlight to you, is that no email is sent to James\u2019s team or more broadly around the Bank about the project.\u201d It continues: \u201cJames can tell his team that he is working on a short-term project on European economics in International [division] which will last a couple of months. This will be in-depth work on a broad range of European economic issues. Ideally he would then say no more.\u201d The email states that Talbot planned to inform staff on Thursday. The message goes on to propose that questions from \u201cother parties (eg: the press) about \u201cwhether this was a project to look at the referendum\u201d, should be given the answer \u201cthat there is a lot going on in Europe in the next couple of months \u2013 pointing to some of the specific European economic issues (eg: Greece) that would be of concern to the Bank\u201d. Among the senior staff listed on the email and aware of the project are: Iain de Weymarn, Mark Carney\u2019s private secretary since last month; Nicola Anderson, head of risk assessment in the financial stability department; Phil Evans, director of the international division; and Jenny Scott, executive director communications. A Bank spokesman said: \u201cIt is stated government policy that there will be a renegotiation and national referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union at some point. It should not come as a surprise that there are a range of economic and financial issues that arise in the context of the renegotiation and national referendum. It is one of the Bank\u2019s responsibilities to assess those that relate to its objectives. \u201cIt is not sensible to talk about this work publicly, in advance. But as with work done prior to the Scottish referendum, we will disclose the details of such work at the appropriate time. While it is unfortunate that this information has entered the public domain in this way, the Bank will maintain this approach.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "And finally, I think, here\u2019s our account of the rather chilly reception dished out to Hungary\u2019s leader in Riga today. France\u2019s finance minister, Michael Sapin, also rules out a parallel currency for Greece. Europe\u2019s stock markets didn\u2019t like the news that German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had apparently mentioned the option of a Greek parallel currency such as IOUs. It caused jitters, even though it was denied quite swiftly, says Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets: The idea of a parallel currency is not without precedent but the news really just reflects Germany\u2019s willingness to take the game of chicken to the very edge, taking any opportunity to show its not worried about a Grexit. Earlier in the month, Greece officials said Athens is not considering a parallel currency. Tsipras may have been all smiles at the EU summit in Riga. But the tough work begins this weekend when he is likely to face a groundswell of opposition at a two-day meeting of Syriza\u2019s central committee. Earlier today, the energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis who heads Syriza\u2019s hardline faction, the Left Platform, told parliament that the governing party could not endorse anything that ran counter to its pre-election programme. Releasing a copy of the speech he will give before the central committee, the increasingly vociferous Syriza MP, Yannis Micheloyiannakis, let it be known that he, too, will not condone concessions that go against the spirit of the leftwing party. \u201cThis is what we were elected on and with this we will struggle and we will win,\u201d he will tell his comrades. \u201cAny going back on the above will be a distortion of the party\u2019s physiognomy.\u201d The meeting will start at 1.30pm local time on Saturday with an address from Tsipras. The Greek government has released a statement following prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 meeting with European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. Our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, reports: Once again, the Greek government is sounding a note of optimism - one that does not appear to be shared by debt-stricken Athens\u2019 creditors. In a statement that smacked more of spin than substance, the government\u2019s tireless press office announced: \u201cPrime minister Alexis Tsipras held a meeting with the president of the EC, Jean Claude Juncker, in a very good climate in which they had a very constructive discussion. The Greek prime minister informed Mr Juncker of the progress in negotiations and expressed the need for a mutual effort by both the Greek government and the institutions so that a mutually beneficial agreement can be found soon within the framework of realism and shared responsibility.\u201d Tsipras will have an uphill struggle to explain some of the concessions he will almost certainly sign up to in the coming days. His anti-austerity Syriza party has gone into overdrive in recent weeks trying to drive home the point that it is doing its best to put up a robust defense of Greece\u2019s interests in a bid to clinch the best possible deal for the country. The head of the International Monetary Fund has also warned against a \u201cquick and dirty\u201d deal for Greece. Speaking in Rio, Christine Lagarde said: \u201cI know there is a lot of work to be done. Parties are now working, receiving proposals, working in cooperation and we will continue to do so as fast as we can.\u201d \u201cIt has to be a comprehensive approach, not a quick and dirty job.\u201d The Financial Times has the inside line on last night\u2019s three-way meeting between the leaders of Germany, France and Greece. Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande told Alexis Tsipras that there\u2019s no way that Greece will get any funds without the agreement of the International Monetary Fund. That is a blow to hopes of a swift deal, or a partial disbursement; Greece, for all its optimism, might not get any funds for some time. Here\u2019s a flavour: The message, delivered by Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, to Alexis Tsipras, her Greek counterpart, at a private meeting in Riga, Latvia\u2019s capital, as well as by lower-level European officials to their Greek interlocutors, comes as the IMF has been weighing whether to withhold its \u20ac3.6bn portion of the \u20ac7.2bn bailout tranche Athens needs to avoid default. Eurozone and Greek negotiators have been pushing to complete a deal by the end of the month to free up bailout funds before the first in a series of loan repayments owed the IMF totalling \u20ac1.5bn falls due June 5. But securing IMF approval for a bailout deal significantly complicates that timeline. Just in: Germany has officially denied that Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has speculated that Greece will need a parallel currency, if talks with its creditors fail. The German finance ministry tweeted the denial at Bloomberg, which made the claim this morning. What happens if you can\u2019t get agreement on issues which you say must change? Cameron says he rules nothing out, but he\u2019s confident that he\u2019ll get a deal. I feel I\u2019ve got the British people at my back - let\u2019s get this referendum and decide. It\u2019s a matter of trust for the British, he argues. We\u2019ve seen all these changes through Treaties, in Nice, Lisbon....those who are younger than 58 never got a chance to have a say on our EU membership. Cameron\u2019s repeating that the rules on free movement need to be changed, to clamp down on Europeans coming to Britain looking for work, rather than having already found a job. Isn\u2019t Britain going to irritate the rest of Europe by demanding changes at this busy time? Might we end up with even fewer friends? I\u2019m not going to say I was met with a wall of love when I arrived, Cameron smiles, but a lot of people were excited about our election victory and keen to work together again. We have serious problems to address...such as the impact of migration, ever closer union. On welfare....It\u2019s common sense to pay into a system before you take out of it. And if you come here to work but leave your family at home, you shouldn\u2019t qualify for child benefit in Britain. Europe must be able to address our \u201ccommon sense\u201d issues, Cameron adds. Are you in a hurry to get this referendum next year? Is that why you raised these issues at a summit about the EU\u2019s links with the former Soviet member states? Our deadline is the end of 2017, but it will be good if can make progress before then. The Eastern Partnership is an important issue, says Cameron, citing the need to protect Ukraine. But it was good to make a start today. Will other European leaders really make concessions, though? We are one of the largest economies in the world, we\u2019re the biggest military power in Europe, replies Cameron. The British people aren\u2019t happy with the status quo with Europe now, and neither am I. I believe I can get a better deal. David Cameron is giving a press conference in Riga now. He\u2019s explaining that his push for a new deal with EU will be a feature at several summits going forward. What about comments from fellow leaders that Treaty change is impossible? You are doing to hear loads of noises in the coming weeks - people saying that the French say no or the Italians say yes. I\u2019m going to get my head down and deliver. It\u2019s like the general election - wait for the result and see, Cameron smiles. The Greek PM has now met with Jean-Claude Juncker.... Donald Tusk\u2019s team just uploaded his statement following the Summit - here\u2019s the conclusion: The European Union is a partner for the long-haul. Our partnership, as well as the Riga Summit itself, are not about dramatic decisions or taking giant steps forward. No, our relationship is built on free will, respect and equality. And our partnership will go forward step-by-step, just as the European Union has been built. Through concrete progress on matters such as trade, energy, transport, mobility and reforms our partnership will grow increasingly closer and offer by far the best prospects for Europe as a whole. David Cameron is going to have a busy week; after hosting Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday, he will jet to Paris and Berlin for talks with Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel. A couple of photos of David Cameron leaving the summit just landed: Here\u2019s the official statement: Joint Declaration of the Eastern Partnership Summit (Riga, 21-22 May 2015) And that\u2019s it. Not a humm-dinger of a press conference. Why does the declaration only talk about the European aspirations of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine? No-one promised that the Eastern Partnership would be a route all the way to EU membership, Tusk says. This is a long-term alliance, and we have gone as far as we could today. You promised good news for Georgia at this meeting - where is it? Latvian prime minister Laimdota Straujuma replies that Georgia, and Ukraine, could be included in the visa-free programme next year, if enough progress is achieved. Juncker adde that he is \u201cvery optimistic\u201d about liberalising the Visa regimes of both countries. It will require support from all 28 members of the EU, though. Onto questions. Was the statement held up because Azerbaijan initially refused to sign up, because of the wording on Crimea? Tusk says the EU had anticipated this problem. But he insists Azerbaijan is determined to strengthen its co-operation with the EU. And are you worried that David Cameron has put the UK on a path out of Europe? Juncker says he doesn\u2019t really understand the question. But he confirms that he will be visiting the UK next Monday - we will consider all the elements that could have been part of your question then, he adds. We have agreed that Energy and Transport policies will be key priorities in the years ahead, says Tusk. On mobility issues... we welcome the impact that Moldova\u2019s visa-free programme has had, says Tusk. But what about Georgia and Ukraine, who both want their citizens to be able to enter the EU without a visa? Tusk says he and Juncker are determined to be \u201cas ambitious as possible\u201d, but it is up to Georgia and Ukraine to also make progress. So no big progress on that issue. The leaders have agreed a 10-page declaration: my colleague Shaun Walker just got his hands on it: The press conference is underway now in Riga -- this live feed is running translations in English, French and Latvian. European Council president Donald Tusk is explaining that all parties reaffirmed their joint interest in strengthening links between the EU and the six former Soviet states. Those countries must be free from intimidation and conflict, and able to exercise their sovereign rights, Tusk says. Hmmmm. Bloomberg is reporting that Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, has raised the issue of a parallel currency for Greece: It\u2019s attributed to \u201cpeople familiar with his views\u201d. And mentioning it exactly a ringing endorsement...... Tick tock... Politico is reporting that Jean-Claude Juncker will be dining at the UK prime minister\u2019s country retreat, Chequers, next week, as Cameron pushes his renegotiation strategy. The summit is wrapping up..... Jean-Claude Juncker is also expected to meet with Alexis Tsipras in Riga today. As flagged up this morning, Juncker has warned that Greece can\u2019t just be \u201cthrown out\u201d of the euro. He told German news magazine Wirtschaftswoche that: [the euro\u2019s] not just about monetary policy and economic reasons, but also the dignity of the Greeks\u201d. We\u2019re expecting a press conference soon with Donald Tusk (President of the European Council), Laimdota Straujuma (Latvian Prime Minister) and Jean-Claude Juncker (President of the EC) in around 10 minutes. It will be streamed live here. Reporters in Riga are tucking in: AFP are reporting that European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker welcomed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to the summit with the words \u201cHi, dictator!\u201d From Riga, my colleague Rowena Mason writes that Cameron will be pushing his reform agenda at the sidelines of today\u2019s summit - particularly with smaller countries whose leaders he meets less often. Despite the cautious statements of German chancellor Angela Merkel this morning, her Greek counterpart is still saying he is \u201coptimistic\u201d a deal will be found that would unlock bailout funds \u201c soon,\u201d Helena Smith reports: The Greek government has just released the statement Alexis Tsipras made as he arrived at the EU summit. Echoing earlier pronouncements by Gavriel Sakellarides, the Greek government spokesman, Tsipras said a \u201clong-term, viable solutions\u201d was visible. \u201cDiscussions last night with Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Francois Hollande were constructive and [held] in a very good and friendly atmosphere. I am optimistic that we can soon arrive at a stable, long-term and viable solutions with the mistakes of the past - and that Greece will return with cohesiveness to growth. I am optimistic.\u201d \u201cWithout the mistakes of the past\u201d would refer to the debt-deflationary spiral that Greece says it is determined to avoid - and there is not sign of that yet. The European Union and Ukraine have signed a Memorandum of Understanding in Riga, that paves the way for \u20ac1.8bn of aid. That\u2019s on top of the \u20ac1.61bn already paid in earlier assistance. The EU says it\u2019s a sign of solidarity with Kiev: Ukraine wants more than that, though. It is pushing for a path towards joining the European Union, and hopes to negotiate a deal to allow its citizens to visit the EU without a visa. The Wall Street Journal explains: Coming into the summit, which ends Friday afternoon, Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova were all pushing for language in the summit conclusions that would allow them to tell their citizens that painful reforms at home could eventually lead them into the European club. Ukraine and Georgia also had hoped for a clear signal that EU leaders would approve their bids for visa-free access to the bloc, a prize Moldova won last year. The draft summit text though, which makes no promises on EU membership. ECB president Mario Draghi is urging eurozone governments to implement structural reforms, in a speech in Sintra, Portugal. It\u2019s not a new theme - Draghi acknowledges that he has raised this issue at every single ECB press conference since he took office. But he\u2019s producing some compelling graphs to show why government need to reform labour markets to boost productivity and get Europe\u2019s potential growth closer to America. But aren\u2019t these political issues outside the remit of a central banker? Draghi argues not: For members of monetary union resilience is crucial to avoid that shocks lead to consistently higher unemployment, and over time, permanent economic divergence. It therefore has direct implications for price stability, and is no less relevant for the integrity of the euro area. This is why the ECB has frequently called for stronger common governance of structural reforms that would make resilience part of our common DNA. After all, not even Mario Draghi can save the eurozone alone: Monetary policy can steer the economy back to its potential. Structural reform can raise that potential, Here\u2019s the speech: Structural Reforms, Inflation and Monetary Policy German business morale has fallen slightly this month, in the latest sign that Europe\u2019s largest economy is in a soft patch. The business climate index calculated by IFO, the Munich-based research institution, fell to 108.5 from 108.6 in April. Economists reckon we shouldn\u2019t panic: Here\u2019s ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski: Given the long recovery the German economy has already gone through, it is only more than normal that growth rates at some point in time will be lower than in the rest of the Eurozone, which in turn has been suffering from weak growth now for several years. David Cameron began his push for EU reform with a meeting with Poland\u2019s PM, Ewa Kopacz. It was a \u201cfriendly but tough\u2019 chat, according to the Polish side - a taste of the reception Cameron will get in Riga? The financial markets are getting tired at the apparent lack of progress towards a Greek deal, says Jeremy Cook, chief economist of World First: Despite the Greek government\u2019s constant assertions that a deal is just around the corner it is looking like they may have been kidding themselves as well as the markets. We can but hope for some positive noises from the non-Greek participants later in the day. For now, they are the only ones to believe. After staying up till 1am talking last night, Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras are seated side-by-side again this morning: When he took office, Alexis Tsipras vowed that he wouldn\u2019t wear a tie to these events until he\u2019d secured a new Greek deal. Five months on, he\u2019s sticking to his guns - despite the risk of being grappled by EC president Juncker. Donald Tusk doesn\u2019t look terribly amused.... No pressure, Mr Cameron: The summit is getting underway. European Parliament president Martin Schulz says it\u2019s a \u201ccrucial\u201d opportunity to bring more stability to the former Soviet states. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, doesn\u2019t share his optimism: David Cameron arrived in Riga, banging the drum for a renegotiated settlement with the EU. There will be lots of noise and ups and down in the months ahead, the UK prime minister predicted. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear one day this is possible, the next day something else is impossible... \u201cBut one thing throughout all of this will be constant and that is my determination to deliver for the British people a reform of the EU so they get a proper choice in that in/out referendum that we\u2019ll hold before the end of 2017. This is Cameron\u2019s first chance to lobby EU leaders face-to-face about reforms since winning the general election a fortnight ago. This referendum will now dominate UK politics, as my colleague Martin Kettle explains: This will be a parliament of two halves: before the EU referendum and after it. Everything in British politics now hinges on the European issue, including the union with Scotland. But Europe\u2019s hour has now arrived. Europe will be the centrepiece of the speech from the throne on Wednesday. The referendum bill will be published within hours. Cameron and his negotiators are in Riga talking to EU leaders this week. Germany is signalling cooperation within bounds. And all the signs are that the government wants the referendum early, possibly as soon as September 2016 \u2013 which is only 16 months away. All other legislative and political business, with the exception of the Scottish devolution plans, will be fitted around the needs of the referendum..... Angela Merkel has arrived at the EU summit in Riga, and made it clear that last night\u2019s meeting with Alexis Tsipras did not deliver a big breakthrough. Greece must keep working \u201cvery, very intensively\u201d with its creditors, she told reporters when asked about the three-way meeting with Francois Hollande. \u201cIt was a very friendly, constructive exchange, but it\u2019s also clear that there must be more work with the three institutions. There is a lot to do.\u201d \u201cFrance and Germany have offered Greece and the Greek Prime Minister that whenever there are questions to be discussed, whenever there is help to be given, to do so but the conclusion needs to be found with the three institutions and there needs to be very, very intensive work.\u201d So once again, Athens\u2019 optimism isn\u2019t really shared by the rest of the eurozone. Europe would be riven with currency wars if it wasn\u2019t protected by the euro, says European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker as he arrived at the Riga summit. The Greek negotiations must speed up, declared Valdis Dombrovskis, European commissioner for the euro, as he arrived in Riga. Dombrovskis put the onus on Greece to show its creditors a proper, detailed, reform plan. There\u2019s a mood of optimism from Athens this morning following last night\u2019s meeting between Tsipras, Merkel and Hollande. Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis has just declared that the Greek administration expects to reach a cash-for-reforms deal with its creditors in the next 10 days. \u201cWe think conditions have matured for (talks) to progress further and in the next 10 days, in May, for the deal to be sealed\u201d. That would take us to the end of May; when Greece must pay pensions and wages. Sakellaridis told Skai TV that this would allow Athens to meet all its payments in June (it also faces \u20ac1.5bn in repayments to the IMF next month), and even join the new eurozone QE programme. \u201cInclusion in this European Central Bank quantitative easing programme falls within the framework of priorities of the Greek government.\u201d But first they need that deal -- and Greece says it isn\u2019t caving in on its \u201cred-lines\u201d... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re watching events in Latvia today, where EU leaders are attending the Eastern Partnership summit Riga. Officially, the meeting is meant to build closer ties between the EU and Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, and make progress towards de-escalating conflict in the region. Eastern Partnership summit, Riga, 21-22/05/2015 But two issues are casting a shadow -- Greece\u2019s bailout talks, and Britain\u2019s push for renegotiation. The summit is starting now, following yesterday\u2019s working dinner -- which preceded a meeting between Greek PM Alexis Tsipras, German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Francois Hollande. As we covered last night in yesterday\u2019s liveblog, the talks were apparently \u2018friendly and constructive\u2019, but without a major breakthrough. AFP explains: After almost two hours of talks the three \u201cagreed on the need for the Greek authorities to keep working with the three institutions\u201d, the aide said, referring to Athens\u2019 \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors - the European Union, the European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund. A Greek government source added that Merkel and Hollande \u201cunderstood the need for a long-term deal\u201d and said they were prepared to \u201cpersonally contribute, if needed, to conclude the agreement soon.\u201d EU leaders will be meeting all morning in Riga, with a press conference at 1.45pm local time or 11.45am BST. We\u2019ll be watching Riga, and tracking all the main events through the day...",

      "bodyText": "A small energy company has become the second firm to apply for a licence to frack for gas in Britain, submitting an application for a site in the Vale of Pickering in Yorkshire. Just days after the new energy secretary, Amber Rudd, expressed her support for hydraulic fracturing, Third Energy has applied to use the controversial technique at a well at Kirby Misperton, about 25 miles from York, near Malton in Ryedale. The site is close to the Flamingo Land theme park and holiday resort. Protests against Third Energy\u2019s plans have already been launched by local residents under the banner \u201cFrack Free Ryedale\u201d. Chris Redston of the group told his local newspaper: \u201cWe will be vigorously opposing the application.\u201d Friends of the Earth has also expressed its opposition, but Third Energy said it was confident that it could proceed in a safe way, although any immediate rewards have diminished owing to the slump in oil and gas prices. \u201cWe know that the gas is present, but it is only by actually hydraulically stimulating the rock that we can understand the potential of the gas to flow and the likely volumes that can be produced,\u201d said the operations director at Third Energy, John Dewar. \u201cWe are proud of our 20-year history of safe and low-key operations in North Yorkshire, and this project is designed to continue in the same way.\u201d The company said gas extracted during the testing phase would be used to produce electricity at a nearby gas-fired power station, but if significant amounts were found, the gas would be sold to the National Grid. Local planning officers are expected to take up to 13 weeks to decide whether or not to recommend that fracking gets the go ahead. A full council decision will follow later. Third Energy\u2019s well is located in the Bowland shale formation, which, experts estimate, contains the bulk of Britain\u2019s shale gas resources. A British Geological Survey published a long-awaited report on shale in 2013 that suggested that an area stretching from Lancashire to Yorkshire and down to Lincolnshire could hold at least 1,300 trillion cubic feet of gas. However, deployment of the fracking technology required to release the gas has proved slow because of local planning delays and protests by environmental campaigners arguing about safety and climate change concerns. Cuadrilla Resources, which has pioneered the first shale wells in recent times, expects to hear next month whether it has won permission to frack two wells in the north-west of Britain. Rudd told the Sunday Times last weekend that she was determined to push forward with shale and even allow extraction under national parks. However, Rudd also promised that such activities would be tightly regulated. \u201cWe have protected groundwater source areas and [prevented] national park drilling. I will make sure that we go out of our way to demonstrate to people the safety elements of it,\u201d she said. Some larger energy companies, such as the Switzerland-based chemicals group Ineos, which owns the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland, want to replicate in Britain the US shale revolution, which has helped cut local energy prices drastically. Jim Ratcliffe, the Ineos chairman, said last November that he wanted to invest almost \u00a3650m in fracking, turning the UK into a major shale gas producer. He has promised to give 6% of all revenues to local communities. \u201cI want Ineos to be the biggest player in the UK shale gas industry. I believe shale gas could revolutionise UK manufacturing, and I know Ineos has the resources to make it happen, the skills to extract the gas safely, and the vision to realise that everyone must share in the rewards.\u201d The price of oil has halved over the last 12 months, while gas prices have also slumped. This has caused financial problems for some of the shale companies in the US. There have been at least a dozen bankruptcy filings in recent months, and more than a dozen have defaulted on bond payments or warned investors of challenging times ahead, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.",

A full council decision will follow later.</p> <p>Third Energy\u2019s well is located in the Bowland shale formation, which, experts estimate, contains the bulk of Britain\u2019s shale gas resources. A British Geological Survey<a href=\"http://www.bgs.ac.uk/shalegas/#ad-image-0\"> published a long-awaited report</a> on shale in 2013 that suggested that an area stretching from Lancashire to Yorkshire and down to Lincolnshire could hold at least 1,300 trillion cubic feet of gas. However, deployment of the fracking technology required to release the gas has proved slow because of local planning delays and protests by environmental campaigners arguing about safety and climate change concerns.</p> <p>Cuadrilla Resources, which has pioneered the first shale wells in recent times, expects to hear next month whether it has won permission to frack two wells in the north-west of Britain.</p> <p>Rudd told the Sunday Times last weekend that she was determined to push forward with shale and even allow extraction under national parks. However, Rudd also promised that such activities would be tightly regulated. \u201cWe have protected groundwater source areas and [prevented] national park drilling. I will make sure that we go out of our way to demonstrate to people the safety elements of it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Some larger energy companies, such as the Switzerland-based chemicals group Ineos, which owns the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland, want to replicate in Britain the US shale revolution, which has helped cut local energy prices drastically. <br></p> <p>Jim Ratcliffe, the Ineos chairman, said last November that he wanted to invest almost \u00a3650m in fracking, turning the UK into a major shale gas producer. He has promised to give 6% of all revenues to local communities. \u201cI want Ineos to be the biggest player in the UK shale gas industry. I believe shale gas could revolutionise UK manufacturing, and I know Ineos has the resources to make it happen, the skills to extract the gas safely, and the vision to realise that everyone must share in the rewards.\u201d</p> <p>The price of oil has halved over the last 12 months, while gas prices have also slumped. This has caused financial problems for some of the shale companies in the US. There have been at least a dozen bankruptcy filings in recent months, and more than a dozen have defaulted on bond payments or warned investors of challenging times ahead, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Shell handpicked auditor to sign off on government's Arctic drilling renewal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Obama administration\u2019s process for giving Shell the go-ahead for restarting its drilling in the Arctic lacked transparency and prevented an informed public response, environmental groups have warned. The results of a third-party audit required by the US government before Royal Dutch Shell be allowed back into the US Arctic remain under wraps, and the third-party auditor \u2013 supposedly taken on to provide better oversight \u2013 was selected and paid for by Shell, the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement confirmed. The consequences of such a lack of transparency and opportunity for public scrutiny are worrying, the environmental group Greenpeace says. Shell had to exit the US Arctic waters in 2012 after the oil giant\u2019s equipment failed an environment protection test. Its activities in the area that year were plagued by embarrassing mishaps, revealing it to be ill-equipped and ill-prepared to operate in the region\u2019s treacherous waters and weather conditions. In one case, one of its giant oil rigs mistakenly ran ashore after breaking off from towing ships in rough sea conditions. But last week the US government reversed the 2012 ban, meaning that Shell, which has already invested $6bn in Arctic oil exploration, is now set to re-enter the Arctic for exploratory drilling as early as this summer. The decision by the US Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management attracted sharp criticism from environmental groups and scientists who warned of the likelihood of an ecological disaster. They also said there was a lack of infrastructure available to deal with such a disaster. According to a US government analysis released this year, the chances of one or more Arctic oil spills happening over the next 77 years are as high as 75%. As part of its response to Shell\u2019s disquieting performance in 2012, the US government issued a report in March 2013 requiring a third-party audit to take place before Shell be allowed to re-enter the region. The first part of such an audit has taken place, but the second half of the audit \u2013 which will happen on-site as the Shell drilling is under way \u2013 will wait until this summer, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement confirmed. The identity of the third-party auditor remains a secret, but it was selected and paid for by Shell. Gregory Julian of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said the auditor had met the agency\u2019s standards and approval before being allowed to take on the role. Greenpeace has filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain details of the first part of the audit, but the information\u2019s release has been delayed. Even when they are eventually received, the results of \u201cphase one\u201d will not have been released in time for the 21-day comment period on Shell\u2019s environment plan that was open between 10 April and 1 May of this year. Although the first part of the audit gave Shell the green light, the content of the audit \u2013 its scope, questions and investigations \u2013 are unknown. \u201cPresident Obama says management and oversight has improved,\u201d Tim Donaghy, a senior research specialist at Greenpeace, said. \u201cBut the lack of transparency makes us very skeptical.\u201d Donaghy warned the Obama administration was \u201ccourting disaster\u201d. Speaking from Camp David last week, and defending the decision to let the oil giant back in, Obama said that nobody was \u201cmore mindful of the risks involved and the dangers\u201d of offshore drilling but that he was reassured by experts, concluding that Royal Dutch Shell had now met new \u201cvery high standards\u201d.",

Latest accounts for Amazon.co.uk show sales of just \u00a3449m for 2013 and a tax charge of \u00a34.2m. Elsewhere in its corporate filings, however, Amazon attributed $7.29bn (\u00a34.71bn) of worldwide net sales to the UK for the same year. The UK business employs thousands of staff, many on low wages, in its network of warehouses, but also large number in sales, procurement and marketing activities. Amazon.co.uk is expected to file its 2014 accounts at Companies House shortly. In April, the UK chancellor, George Osborne, introduced a punitive 25% tax on profits \u2013 dubbed the \u201cGoogle tax\u201d \u2013 for those companies deemed to be artificially diverting business overseas. Multinationals have several months to rearrange their affairs before the tax starts to bite. UK shoppers\u2019 receipts show Amazon is still choosing to route sales through Luxembourg and, to date, the company has declined to comment on its likely response to Osborne\u2019s diverted profits tax. A year ago, North claimed in an interview with the Guardian that Amazon\u2019s European corporate structure was not determined by tax avoidance strategies, insisting it would be impossible to route sales to UK customers through a British company paying tax to HMRC. \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a single European business is going to need a single European headquarters.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A sharp fall in Whitehall spending and lower interest bills on government debt helped narrow Britain\u2019s public sector budget deficit in April. A steady rise in tax receipts in the first month of the financial year also played a part following a record-breaking VAT haul, a bumper rise in corporation tax receipts and the rebound in stamp duty on property sales. However, Whitehall budgets were flattered by a reduction in council funding that is likely to prove temporary, leading analysts to warn that achieving a balanced budget within five years would be difficult without further cuts in government spending. Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said George Osborne would struggle to justify tax cuts in his July budget without a further attack on public services and welfare payments. He said: \u201cWhile April\u2019s figures bring more good news on the current health of the UK\u2019s public finances, a major and painful reintensification of the fiscal squeeze will still be required for the government to obtain an overall budget surplus in this parliament. \u201cIt is highly unlikely that this pace of spending cuts can be maintained in future months. \u201cAccordingly, the chancellor is unlikely to have spare funds to dispense at the summer budget on 8 July, and any steps towards the Conservatives\u2019 unfunded manifesto tax and spending commitments will require extra revenue-raising measures or deeper cuts to other departments\u2019 budgets than already planned by the coalition.\u201d The Treasury said that the deficit, at just under 5%, is still one of the highest in the developed world. \u201cThere is no shortcut to fixing the public finances so we have to continue with the hard work of identifying savings and making reforms necessary to finish the job and build a resilient economy,\u201d a spokeswoman said. The Office for National Statistics said public sector net borrowing, excluding state-controlled banks, totalled \u00a36.8bn in April, down nearly 27% from a year earlier and the lowest for that month since 2008. The public coffers were swelled by the highest VAT haul for April since records began in the 1997-98 financial year, coupled with a jump in income tax receipts to \u00a311.6bn and the highest corporation tax revenues for the month since 2008. Only an expected \u00a3200m reduction in TV licence receipts, which were omitted from the monthly data, kept the average growth figure for tax receipts from breaking through the 3% barrier. A \u00a3200m reduction in receipts from the Bank of England\u2019s APS scheme, which insures the Royal Bank of Scotland against losses on \u00a3250bn of its loan book, also helped reduce the average rise in tax receipts to 2.7% But the deficit mainly fell after a \u00a34.7bn cut in Whitehall spending, including a one-off \u00a34.3bn cut in local government grants, which was partly offset by a \u00a31.9bn rise in capital spending. A near 7% reduction in interest payments also helped squeeze the deficit as Britain\u2019s ultra-low inflation reduced the government\u2019s bill on inflation-linked bonds. Osborne aims to wipe out the deficit by 2018-19 after failing to eliminate it by 2015, as was agreed by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats at the outset of their coalition government in 2010. Revised figures published by the ONS showed borrowing in the 2014-15 tax year totalled \u00a387.7bn, compared with an earlier estimate of \u00a387.3bn and a government goal of no more than \u00a390.2bn. In March, Osborne said he wanted to reduce borrowing to \u00a375.3bn this financial year, equivalent to 4.0% of GDP. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said last year\u2019s figures showed the chancellor borrowed an extra \u00a350bn \u201cto bail out his failed economic plan\u201d. She said: \u201cThe failure to get wages growing has left the public finances in a mess, with income tax revenues and national insurance receipts falling \u00a333bn short of expectations for the last year alone. \u201cThe extreme cuts the chancellor is planning for his July budget will put our weak recovery at further risk, and leave our schools, hospitals and other services without the vital revenues they need. We need a better plan based on investment in skills, infrastructure and innovation to create good jobs with decent wages.\u201d David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said it was too early to identify trends in this financial year from the April figures but said we could well see further reductions in the months ahead. \u201cHowever, we must not dismiss the huge challenge the government still faces to reduce the deficit and stabilise public finances. Britain\u2019s financial sector was hit hard during the recession and, together with lower oil and gas output, the UK\u2019s ability to generate tax revenues is constrained,\u201d he said.",

But from January 2016, she will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/22/costa-coffee-group-hires-alison-brittain-as-new-chief-executive-whitbread\">take charge of the hospitality group Whitbread</a>, putting her at the helm of the nation\u2019s biggest coffee chain, Costa Coffee, and one of the largest budget hotel brands, Premier Inn.</p> <p>Brittain, a career banker who spent nearly two decades at Barclays, was not the obvious choice to take over the hotel and pub group, which also includes Brewers Fayre and Beefeater Grill Restaurants. The veteran retail analyst Nick Bubb described her as a \u201crank outsider\u201d.<br></p> <p>But Whitbread chairman Richard Baker said she was the \u201cstandout candidate from a very strong field\u201d, adding that her strong personal belief in putting the customer at the centre made her \u201ca perfect fit with our culture and values\u201d. </p> <p>Sources close to the company stress the broadbrush similarities between Lloyds and Costa Coffee. The Lloyds Banking Group, which includes Halifax and Bank of Scotland, has 2,200 branches with 30 million customers. The relentlessly expanding Costa Coffee has nearly 2,000 UK outlets, while 25 million people are said to visit a Whitbread hotel, restaurant or cafe each month.</p> <p>The group\u2019s current chief executive Andy Harrison was also a newcomer to the hospitality trade. Before joining Whitbread, he was in charge of easyJet and the RAC car breakdown service.</p> <p>Neither is Brittain a stranger to the more fun outposts of the high street.

      "bodyText": "Alison Brittain is swapping current accounts and mortgages for cappuccinos and mini-breaks. Currently the boss of Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s retail banking arm, she is one of the most powerful women in the City. But from January 2016, she will take charge of the hospitality group Whitbread, putting her at the helm of the nation\u2019s biggest coffee chain, Costa Coffee, and one of the largest budget hotel brands, Premier Inn. Brittain, a career banker who spent nearly two decades at Barclays, was not the obvious choice to take over the hotel and pub group, which also includes Brewers Fayre and Beefeater Grill Restaurants. The veteran retail analyst Nick Bubb described her as a \u201crank outsider\u201d. But Whitbread chairman Richard Baker said she was the \u201cstandout candidate from a very strong field\u201d, adding that her strong personal belief in putting the customer at the centre made her \u201ca perfect fit with our culture and values\u201d. Sources close to the company stress the broadbrush similarities between Lloyds and Costa Coffee. The Lloyds Banking Group, which includes Halifax and Bank of Scotland, has 2,200 branches with 30 million customers. The relentlessly expanding Costa Coffee has nearly 2,000 UK outlets, while 25 million people are said to visit a Whitbread hotel, restaurant or cafe each month. The group\u2019s current chief executive Andy Harrison was also a newcomer to the hospitality trade. Before joining Whitbread, he was in charge of easyJet and the RAC car breakdown service. Neither is Brittain a stranger to the more fun outposts of the high street. She is a non-executive director at Marks &amp; Spencer, a job she took because she is \u201ca huge fan and a huge shopper\u201d of the business. Hailing from Derbyshire, Brittain has a degree in business studies from Stirling University and an MBA from Cambridge University\u2019s Judge Institute. She initially set her sights on going into marketing, but ended up joining Barclays\u2019 graduate trainee scheme and working at the bank for 19 years. She even met her husband Kevin in a Barclays branch on Baker Street - at the time just a few doors from Marks &amp; Spencer, which was one of her clients. As a few worries surfaced about being \u201cinstitutionalised\u201d at Barclays, Brittain jumped ship for Santander in 2007. She moved to Lloyds in 2011, at a time when the bank was still reeling from a \u00a320bn taxpayer bailout and a string of mis-selling scandals, not limited to PPI. In 2013 Lloyds was fined a record \u00a328m and ordered to compensate up to 700,000 customers of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland who were mis-sold products by staff desperate to hit targets on sales and bonuses. In an interview with the Daily Mail Brittain blamed \u201cthe Americanisation of banking\u201d, perceived as a dig at Eric Daniels, the Montana-born executive who took charge of Lloyds\u2019 retail banking operations in 2001 and became chief executive in 2003. Her defection from Lloyds is a blow to the bank, where she was seen as a favourite to replace current chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio. When she starts at Whitbread next January, she will join a select club of FTSE 100 female chief executives, currently numbering just five. Brittain is ambivalent about quotas to increase boardroom roles. She told the Observer in 2012 that she worried the focus on boosting the number of female non-executives will \u201csuck out\u201d talented women who might have gone on to become CEOs. \u201cWhere are the chief executives of the future going to come from when 38-to-48-year olds are missing from the full-time workforce.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Premier Inn and Costa Coffee group Whitbread has appointed Alison Brittain as its next chief executive, boosting the number of female CEOs at FTSE 100 companies to six. Brittain, who is in charge of the retail division of Lloyds Bank, joins Whitbread on 4 January 2016. She will take over from Andy Harrison, who announced his retirement from full-time executive roles last month. She will be paid a basic salary of \u00a3775,000, but once benefits and performance-related bonuses are included, her package could be worth \u00a36.4m. Richard Baker, the Whitbread chairman, said: \u201cWe are delighted to have secured someone of Alison\u2019s calibre. We ran an extensive search and selection process and Alison was the standout candidate from a very strong field.\u201d He also praised her \u201cnatural ability to inspire and motivate large customer-facing teams\u201d and \u201cproven experience in delivering digital online and mobile technology\u201d. Whitbread, which owns Premier Inns, Brewers Fayre and Costa Coffee, has seen profits soar as it capitalises on the UK\u2019s seemingly insatiable demand for frothy coffee, as well as growth in the market for budget hotels. Brittain\u2019s appointment takes her into a select group of female CEOs at the top of Britain\u2019s biggest companies that includes V\u00e9ronique Laury at Kingfisher, Liv Garfield at Severn Trent, Moya Greene at Royal Mail, Alison Cooper at Imperial Tobacco and Carolyn McCall at easyJet. However, female CEOs of FTSE 100 companies are still far outnumbered by male bosses called John. Women hold 23.5% of FTSE 100 directorships, according to the latest report from Lord Mervyn Davies, the government\u2019s champion of gender equality in the boardroom. But progress has been slower when it comes to promoting women into the most powerful jobs in British companies \u2013 the chief executive, chief finance officer and chairmanship roles. Brittain, aged 50, has been called the most powerful woman in British banking. Her departure from Lloyds will come as a blow to the 20% state-owned bank, where she has been overhauling systems after a mis-selling scandal in which customers were sold products they did not need. She started at Lloyds in 2011 after holding senior roles at Barclays and Santander. She is also a non-executive director at Marks &amp; Spencer. One insider described her appointment as \u201ca fairly unanimous choice\u201d, with her customer-focused role at Lloyds making her a natural fit. She beat off competition from external and internal candidates, including the managing director of Costa Coffee, Christopher Rogers. The appointment of a career banker caused some surprise among industry watchers, but analysts at Credit Suisse described her as a highly credible choice: \u201cShe is a high-calibre individual, [a] good communicator and engages well with investors.\u201d Brittain said: \u201cI am absolutely delighted to have been chosen to lead Whitbread. I am impressed by its success and its strong, well-loved brands. Its belief in focusing on customers and team members is something that is very close to my heart and I am committed to supporting and developing this even further in the future.\u201d",
