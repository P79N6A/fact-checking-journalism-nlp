      "bodyText": "Bovis Homes on Monday joined a growing list of housebuilders to report a strong rise in profits over the last six months from a surprise rise in prices and sales. Bovis said prices were 6% higher and sales up 18% on the same period in 2011 despite the weakening economic outlook and lack of mortgage lending. The company, which has shifted most of its building to the south of England, said it had enough land with consents to last three to four years in normal trading and much longer if the trend for low levels of transactions persists for another year. Chief executive David Ritchie said the firm had 30,600 plots that could be used for house building, \"but I'll only build as many as I can sell\". The company's profitability has also been boosted by a strategy to buy up development plots whose value had been depressed in the financial crisis, along with an increase in the number of its sales outlets and its focus on building in regions where house prices have stayed strong. Ritchie said it was financially safer to build below a line drawn from Cheltenham in the west to Cambridge in the east after a severe slowdown in the northern half of the country. Like most building firms, Bovis has scaled back the number of homes it builds each year and restored margins by reducing staffing levels and other outgoings. In the first half of 2007, at the height of the boom, the company built 1,250 homes compared with 944 completions in the last six months. Bovis builds mainly three to five bedroom family homes on greenfield sites north and west of London where the demand for new homes has remained robust. Rivals Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon and Barratt Developments also reported strong profit growth this year after a torrid four years during which many housebuilders have gone out of business and others, hugely indebted after a pre-crisis spending spree, were only saved by the forgiveness of their banks. Taylor Wimpey reported an increase in first half profit up 50%, helped by strong demand for its properties, and said it expected full-year 2012 returns to be in line with its expectations. Britain's second largest builder by market value, Taylor Wimpey saw operating profit jump to \u00a3100.9m against \u00a367.2m in the same period last year. Bovis, which also builds social housing for housing associations, celebrated a 27% increase in revenues to \u00a3170m compared to \u00a3133m in the same period last year. Last year it built only 844 homes in the first six months. Brokers have put buy notices on much of the industry, believing in the potential for growth after a sharp reduction in debts and the potential for further increases in sales should the economy recover. Some analysts believe house prices could fall further outside central London. Ritchie said initiatives to support extra lending in the economy by the Bank of England had failed to reach its customers, who were still considered high risks by lenders, but more specific government initiatives were having a positive effect. He praised the NewBuy scheme that acts as an insurance bond to protect lenders against the default of a new mortgage. So far only a trickle of customers have successfully come through the scheme, though he expects momentum to grow over the next couple of years. He poured cold water on plans to jettison requirements for social housing in major developments, saying the lack of financial underpinning from housing associations may undermine the projects. \"If that was to come to fruition as a policy, one of the concerns would be, how are the banks going to support an increased level of private development?\" Richie said. \"In the short term it could potentially be difficult ... to see volumes growing.\" Bovis and its rivals are required under UK law to set aside a proportion of their schemes to be sold as affordable, cheaper homes. But recent reports have suggested a review by Sir Adrian Montague, the chairman of venture capital group 3i will suggest this stipulation is relaxed.",

    "webTitle": "Foreign firms dig deep for Mongolia's commodity riches", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of the Mongolian stock exchange sits in a beige office behind an old PC, his BlackBerry ringing incessantly. Although Altai Khangai is only 31, his hair shows traces of gray; he wears a pink-striped shirt and designer glasses. \"I think the exchange will bring a fundamental change to Mongolia,\" he says in between sips of coffee. \"It will transform Mongolia.\" Located in a former children's cinema on Sukhbator Square in the centre of Ulan Bator, the Mongolian stock exchange (MSE) was opened in 1993 as a way to privatise government-owned assets after almost 70 years of Soviet rule. It originally had 30 brokers and was open for two hours a week. Times have changed. The MSE recently completed a three-year, $14m (\u00a38.9m) partnership with the London Stock Exchange, and installed a top-of-the-line brokering software system called Millennium IT, considered the best in the world. It was the world's top performing stock exchange in 2010; last year it was number two, after Venezuela. \"Some strange things take place in Mongolia, but things are improving and we're progressing,\" Altai said. Driving progress at the MSE is the recent discovery of vast mineral deposits in the Mongolian hinterlands, some of which found their way into the medals awarded at the Olympic Games in London. Last year, Mongolia's economy grew by 17.3%, the fastest rate in Asia and almost double that of China, one \u2013 with Russia \u2013 of its two vast immediate neighbours. If you were going to develop a commodity supply source anywhere \u2013 even today, when global commodity prices have taken a dip \u2013 it would be in this former Soviet satellite right next to China, the most resource-hungry market in the world. The boom in Mine-golia, as some are now dubbing it, has arrived courtesy of a wave of investment from foreign firms wanting to get their hands on copper, coal and rare earth minerals. The US group Nova Mining Corporation recently said it planned to build a railway line from Mongolia to the Chinese coast as a way to ship supplies of lithium needed to meet demand from Apple for new iPhones. Lithium is a key ingredient in long-life batteries for phones and electric cars and Nova is close to an exclusive deal to tie up supplies from the Mongolian National Mining consultants. Other mining projects include the Tavan Tolgoi opencast coal facility in the southern Gobi region. Tavan Tolgoi has estimated reserves of as much as 7.5bn tonnes of coal, including the world's largest untapped deposit of coking coal, which is used to make steel. Output from Tavan and elsewhere is expected to grow from a current level of about 16m tonnes a year to as much as 240m by 2040, according to some estimates. Also coming online is the Oyu Tolgoi, a vast source of copper and gold in the southern Gobi that sits just 50 miles north of the Chinese border. The mine is ultimately controlled by the London-based mining group Rio Tinto, and is expected to start production in the next few months after $6bn of investment \u2013 the largest single investment in Mongolian history. Problematic Chinese relationship \"Economists estimate that the Mongolian economy will be more than a third larger in 2019 because of Oyu Tolgoi (OT),\" said a spokesman at Rio's London head office. \"Beyond the mine itself, OT is driving the biggest revolution in infrastructure building ever in the South Gobi, constructing roads, an airport, and power lines that will supply local towns with 24-hour electricity for the first time. We are sponsoring the largest vocational training programme in Mongolia's history, educating 3,300 of Mongolia's future workforce in professions as diverse as accountancy, IT and environmental management.\" But all this foreign involvement and a growing relationship with China is not without its problems. Nor is the domestic political situation entirely stable, with the former prime minister having been jailed for four years last month for corruption and a new leader, Norov Altankhuyag, from the Democratic party, confirmed in office only nine days ago. The current government is opposing a near-$1bn bid from Aluminium Corporation of China (Chalco) for SouthGobi Resources, a business with coalmining interests in Mongolia. Last week Alex Molyneux, the chief executive of SouthGobi, said the government had made the deal \"impossible\" and he believed the Chinese had dropped their interest, although they have until 4 September to formalise their bid. An expected stock market flotation by Tavan Tolgoi, expected for both the Mongolian and London stock exchanges, was recently put back from this year to early 2013 for reasons many attribute to political interference. The path of progress has never been a straight line at the local exchange. In the early 1990s, the MSE gave each Mongolian citizen a small packet of pink and blue coupons, which they could use to bid for shares in hitherto state-owned companies. Most Mongolians did not understand the value of equity, however, and a small handful of the urban elite snapped up the coupons for a pittance. And many of the MSE's current members are a fossilized reminder of its early failures. Only 40 of the 350 companies listed on the exchange are actively trading; daily trading volume rarely exceeds $150,000. The exchange has delivered 17 IPOs in its history. \"The MSE basically lost its credibility a long time ago, which is why it needs to redefine itself,\" said Nagi Otgonshar, a vice president at Resource Investment Capital, a financial advisory firm in Ulan Bator. The exchange's's American-educated chief regulatory officer, Saruul Ganbaatar, said that the MSE has drafted a new securities law which will make it easier for Mongolian companies to list on the exchange \u2013 and for foreigners to invest in them. Ganbaatar accepts that Mongolian politicians and broking houses have been struggling to learn the ropes of modern capital markets. \"When I started last year there were 46 brokerages and now there are over 80,\" he said. \"This brings in a risk that some are not so competent, or not trained as well.\" Outside the room, optimism is certainly still high; some analysts say that the combined wealth from the country's 10 biggest mines, if evenly distributed, could make every Mongolian citizen a millionaire. Ulan Bator has begun to acquire the trappings of a boomtown. Across from the MSE is a gleaming 25-story office tower with Louis Vuitton and Armani outlets on the lower floors. Beyond, a sprawl of ramshackle Soviet apartment buildings and traditional felt-lined tents stretches into the distance.",

      "body": "<p>The chief executive of the Mongolian stock exchange sits in a beige office behind an old PC, his BlackBerry ringing incessantly. Although Altai Khangai is only 31, his hair shows traces of gray; he wears a pink-striped shirt and designer glasses. \"I think the exchange will bring a fundamental change to Mongolia,\" he says in between sips of coffee. \"It will transform Mongolia.\"</p> <p>Located in a former children's cinema on Sukhbator Square in the centre of Ulan Bator, the Mongolian stock exchange (MSE) was opened in 1993 as a way to privatise government-owned assets after almost 70 years of Soviet rule. It originally had 30 brokers and was open for two hours a week.</p> <p>Times have changed. The MSE recently completed a three-year, $14m (\u00a38.9m) partnership with the London Stock Exchange, and installed a top-of-the-line brokering software system called Millennium IT, considered the best in the world.</p> <p>It was the world's top performing stock exchange in 2010; last year it was number two, after Venezuela. \"Some strange things take place in Mongolia, but things are improving and we're progressing,\" Altai said.</p> <p>Driving progress at the MSE is the recent discovery of vast mineral deposits in the Mongolian hinterlands, some of which found their way into the medals awarded at the Olympic Games in London. Last year, Mongolia's economy grew by 17.3%, the fastest rate in Asia and almost double that of China, one \u2013 with Russia \u2013 of its two vast immediate neighbours.</p> <p>If you were going to develop a commodity supply source anywhere \u2013 even today, when global commodity prices have taken a dip \u2013 it would be in this former Soviet satellite right next to China, the most resource-hungry market in the world.</p> <p>The boom in Mine-golia, as some are now dubbing it, has arrived courtesy of a wave of investment from foreign firms wanting to get their hands on copper, coal and rare earth minerals.</p> <p>The US group Nova Mining Corporation recently said it planned to build a railway line from Mongolia to the Chinese coast as a way to ship supplies of lithium needed to meet demand from Apple for new iPhones. Lithium is a key ingredient in long-life batteries for phones and electric cars and Nova is close to an exclusive deal to tie up supplies from the Mongolian National Mining consultants.</p> <p>Other mining projects include the Tavan Tolgoi opencast coal facility in the southern Gobi region. Tavan Tolgoi has estimated reserves of as much as 7.5bn tonnes of coal, including the world's largest untapped deposit of coking coal, which is used to make steel. Output from Tavan and elsewhere is expected to grow from a current level of about 16m tonnes a year to as much as 240m by 2040, according to some estimates.</p> <p>Also coming online is the Oyu Tolgoi, a vast source of copper and gold in the southern Gobi that sits just 50 miles north of the Chinese border. The mine is ultimately controlled by the London-based mining group Rio Tinto, and is expected to start production in the next few months after $6bn of investment \u2013 the largest single investment in Mongolian history.</p> <h2>Problematic Chinese relationship</h2> <p>\"Economists estimate that the Mongolian economy will be more than a third larger in 2019 because of Oyu Tolgoi (OT),\" said a spokesman at Rio's London head office. \"Beyond the mine itself, OT is driving the biggest revolution in infrastructure building ever in the South Gobi, constructing roads, an airport, and power lines that will supply local towns with 24-hour electricity for the first time. We are sponsoring the largest vocational training programme in Mongolia's history, educating 3,300 of Mongolia's future workforce in professions as diverse as accountancy, IT and environmental management.\"</p> <p>But all this foreign involvement and a growing relationship with China is not without its problems. Nor is the domestic political situation entirely stable, with the former prime minister having been jailed for four years last month for corruption and a new leader, Norov Altankhuyag, from the Democratic party, confirmed in office only nine days ago.</p> <p>The current government is opposing a near-$1bn bid from Aluminium Corporation of China (Chalco) for SouthGobi Resources, a business with coalmining interests in Mongolia.</p> <p>Last week Alex Molyneux, the chief executive of SouthGobi, said the government had made the deal \"impossible\" and he believed the Chinese had dropped their interest, although they have until 4 September to formalise their bid.</p> <p>An expected stock market flotation by Tavan Tolgoi, expected for both the Mongolian and London stock exchanges, was recently put back from this year to early 2013 for reasons many attribute to political interference.</p> <p>The path of progress has never been a straight line at the local exchange.

      "bodyText": "Military equipment maker, Chemring, has seen its shares plunged more than 10% on rumours that a possible takeover by private equity firm Carlyle Group could be about to collapse. On Friday the share price of the company, which makes flares and equipment for detecting Improvised Explosive Devices, revealed it had been approached after speculation began circling and the share price started to move. But the company was keen to stress the approach was a \"highly preliminary expression of interest\" in the hope not to scare off the potential investors. That didn't stop investors piling in, sending the share price up 26%. Now that the dust has settled a little and cool heads are prevailing, the sensible investors are beginning to sell and the shareprice now sits down 43.6p, 10.5%, at 371.1p. Carlyle now has until September 14 to either make a firm offer or walk away. In a note, analysts at UBS said: We would advocate a degree of caution as the release states \"highly preliminary\" and that CHG [Chemring] was required to issue a statement because of the strong share price movement on Friday (+10% before the release), implying a reasonable chance that the bid does not materialise. Others suggest the opening of a takeover period could see another buyer emerge. Oriel analysts wrote: The approach may flush out a trade buyer, it is our view that re-integrating the Chemring businesses will not be part of defence primes strategies and they will not be interested in out bidding PE [private equity]. Chemring would be a much more strategically important asset to smaller defence suppliers such as Esterline Technologies, ATK or Rheinmetall. The problem these companies face is their much more financially constrained than the primes and the question will be if they could get the funding and act fast enough to outbid Carlyle. The company said in June that it was on track to meet full year expectations and its order book was up 14% at \u00a31bn since October 2011. However, there has been fears that the firm and rivals would struggle after the US and EU countries cut defence spending during the downturn. Shares are down nearly 20% from their January high of 452.6p.",

The South African-based company, with some brass plates in London, issued a statement late last night revealing it had extended its deadline for striking miners to return to work from Friday to today \"in the light of the tragic events of last Thursday\" which saw 34 workers shot dead by police.
