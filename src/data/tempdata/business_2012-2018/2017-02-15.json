      "bodyText": "The government has named and shamed a record 360 firms for underpaying their staff, with the list of offenders topped by Debenhams after nearly 12,000 of the department store\u2019s workers were short-changed. The businesses, including large numbers of hair salons, hotels, care homes and retailers, failed to pay either the national minimum wage or the national living wage to more than 15,500 workers, according to the list published by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The number of offenders surged as it includes the first group named for failing to pay the national living wage of \u00a37.20 an hour for those over 25, which was introduced last year. The businesses were forced to pay back \u00a3995,233 to workers as well as penalties totalling \u00a3800,000 to HMRC. Excuses for underpaying workers included using tips to top up pay, docking workers\u2019 wages to pay for their Christmas party and making staff pay for their own uniforms out of their salary. More than 1,000 firms have now been publicly shamed for underpaying their staff since the name and shame system was introduced in 2013. They have underpaid their staff by a total of more than \u00a34.5m. Fines of more than \u00a32m have been levied in addition to firms being forced to make good the wages owed. Debenhams was named as the most prolific offender since the naming and shaming system came into force in 2013. The company was hit with a \u00a363,000 fine and forced to pay back nearly \u00a3135,000 to nearly 12,000 workers. The company said it had underpaid staff by an average \u00a310 each in 2015 because of a \u201ctechnical error in its payroll calculations\u201d. A spokesman for the department store said: \u201cAs a responsible employer Debenhams is committed to the national minimum wage, and as soon as the error was identified by a routine HMRC audit last year we reimbursed all those affected. We have apologised to all our colleagues affected and have taken steps to ensure it cannot happen again.\u201d The error by Debenhams is embarrassing, but many businesses were found to have underpaid individual staff members by thousands of pounds. Tasman Ltd, a Harley Street property company that lets space to doctors and dental practices, was the worst offender. It was found to have underpaid a housekeeper by more than \u00a311,000 over a number of years. Hospitality businesses, including restaurants and hotels, feature in the list most often for underpaying their staff, with 84 employers underpaying 563 workers in total. Lorenzo Berni was found to have underpaid 29 workers by more than \u00a353,000 at his upmarket Knightsbridge restaurant Osteria San Lorenzo. Only last year Berni\u2019s Wimbledon eatery, which is a favourite haunt of tennis stars including Boris Becker, was forced to pay back almost \u00a3100,000 to 30 other employees. The company said the problem had occurred while it was dealing with family crises. Contacted at his luxury Knightsbridge restaurant this week, Berni declined to comment. The restaurateur answered the phone but refused to respond and passed the phone to a colleague, who said only: \u201cWe have nothing to say.\u201d Those working in retail and the social care sector were next most likely to be underpaid. Kate Ashley, a director of Pembrokeshire Care, a home care company in rural west Wales that underpaid 154 carers by \u00a355,000, said the company had miscalculated the amount of travel time their employees should be paid to get to their mostly elderly clients \u201cWe thought we were paying the right amount and the HMRC found that we weren\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have put in place a new system of calculation that the HMRC has said it is happy with. The social care sector is under tremendous pressure and we are on tight margins, which are getting tighter all the time.\u201d The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, called on the government to take tougher action on \u201cserious offenders\u201d who flouted the law, including prosecutions and higher fines. \u201cMinimum wage dodgers must have nowhere to hide. We need to see strong unions in every workplace to stop these abuses from happening,\u201d O\u2019Grady said. The Unite union also called for tougher action against unscrupulous bosses of firms that underpay, including a new \u201cwage theft\u201d offence, as exists in the US, punishable with a jail sentence. Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary Steve Turner said naming and shaming was welcome, but bigger deterrents were needed. Turner said it was \u201cpathetic\u201d that only 13 businesses had been prosecuted for underpayment since 2007. \u201cIn America,\u201d he said, \u201cbad bosses are jailed and heavily fined for \u2018wage theft\u2019, which is what this is, exploiting workers in such a shameful fashion.\u201d The business minister Margot James said that by naming and shaming the government was \u201csending a clear message to employers that minimum wage abuses will not go unpunished\u201d. \u201cEvery worker in the UK is entitled to at least the national minimum or living wage and this government will ensure they get it,\u201d James said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British Airways has threatened to increase the penalties for cabin crew who continue to strike while halving the punishments for those who return to work, according to a staff email seen by the Guardian. The airline said workers who continued to strike would lose bonuses and staff perks for up to two years. About 2,900 crew members in BA\u2019s mixed fleet who belong to the Unite union are embroiled in an industrial dispute with the airline, which it says offers \u201cpoverty pay\u201d to its cabin crew. The airline has faced 11 days of strike action so far this year over the dispute, with a further eight days scheduled over the next fortnight. In a note circulated to staff, the airline warned of significant increases in sanctions to those who joined the forthcoming strikes. Unite accused the airline of having \u201cbullied and bribed\u201d staff in an attempt to break the strike. BA previously warned staff in an email that those who participated in strikes in the first fortnight of the month would lose any bonus for 2016 and would see their 2017 bonuses affected. They would also lose three months\u2019 worth of the \u201cMy Incentives\u201d payments scheme, as well as perks including staff travel and discounted travel for family and friends for a year. Unite said the withdrawal of the My Incentives payment and bonus could amount to up to \u00a3850 a year. Basic pay in the mixed fleet, which all new BA recruits join, starts at about \u00a312,000, though the airline says the crew earn a minimum of \u00a321,000 after allowances and bonuses. Unite says cabin crew earn \u00a316,000 a year on average. Following Unite\u2019s announcement on Tuesday of four additional days of strikes, BA emailed members of the mixed fleet offering a \u201cone-off incentive to resume normal working\u201d. They would receive 50% of any bonuses they had lost through previous strike action and would see the loss of perks such as staff travel and discounts for friends and family limited to a period of three months. But the airline added that anyone who continued to strike would \u201csee a loss of My Incentives payments for the whole of 2017, complete loss of bonus for 2016 and 2017, and loss of staff travel benefits and Hotline [discounted booking for friends and family] access for 24 months.\u201d The offer is understood to be a highly unusual way of handling the strike. One observer, who asked not to be named, said it risked poisoning industrial relations with the company. Unite regional officer Matt Smith said: \u201cPunishing workers for standing up against poverty pay in the first instance and now trying to bribe them back to work if they repent is extraordinary behaviour from an airline that once described itself as the world\u2019s favourite. Our members will not be bullied or bribed into not striking by British Airways.\u201d He added: \u201cRather than going to such extreme lengths with such extreme behaviour, we would urge British Airways to sit down with us at Acas to reach a negotiated solution.\u201d A BA spokeswoman said: \u201cUnite has decided to press ahead with strike action. We have said that we will fly 100% of our customers to their destinations and so are taking these steps to maximise support for our operation. We want to encourage our colleagues to come to work and therefore have repeatedly explained the consequences of taking strike action to them.\u201d",

The European commission has given \u201cgeographical indication\u201d (GI) status to 1,150 products, meaning companies can only use the name of a locality in their marketing if the product is from that area. When the UK leaves the EU, it will no longer need to abide by the directives and could, for example, rename some English sparking wine as English champagne, or ham as English parma ham. A document from the European parliament\u2019s agriculture committee, which is advising the chamber\u2019s leaders on the Brexit negotiations, says: \u201cAs things currently stand, the UK has 59 such registered names [out of a total of 1,150 at EU level], including e.g. Lakeland Herwick Meat, West Country Farmhouse Cheddar Cheese, West Wales Coracle Caught Sewin [sea trout], and [economically important] Scotch Whisky. \u201cThe question of what will happen to EU GIs after the withdrawal of the UK is a difficult one. \u201cIf no arrangements to another effect are made, the protection afforded by the above-mentioned legislation would normally cease to apply in the UK, which means that over a thousand European registered names could be exposed to violation in this neighbouring country of the EU27 [while paradoxically the 59 UK names would remain protected in the EU if the commission decisions granting this protection are not repealed].\u201d The document drawn up by MEPs warns: \u201cIn the hypothesis where the UK, as a third country, would enter into a new relationship with the EU27 based on a free trade agreement it would be important therefore to include a mutual recognition of GIs in such an agreement on the model.\u201d The leaked analysis also says Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU will leave a large hole in the budget of the Common Agricultural Policy, which pays farmers across the continent billions of euros in subsidies. The document says: \u201cIt is obvious that the Brexit will lead to a significant gap in the financing of the CAP once the UK contributions, on the one hand, and the expenditures related to British agriculture on the other hand have been removed.\u201d The committee says the cost will be \u201csomewhere between \u20ac1.2bn and \u20ac3.1bn if the EU wants to maintain current spending levels for the remaining 27 member states\u201d. MEPs are also concerned that the UK\u2019s withdrawal will impact on current free trade deals, as the size of the European market available to firms in third countries would be reduced. \u201cThe departure of the UK might somehow disrupt the economic balance on the basis of which these agreements were concluded,\u201d they write. \u201cFor example, the third countries concerned might legitimately complain about a unilateral reduction by the EU of the size of the market to which they have been given access.\u201d The MEPs suggest the UK will need to maintain EU standards during any transitional period before a free trade agreement can be struck. There is particular concern that the UK will jeopardise any such deal if, as some on the right of the Conservative party have advocated, it accepts the production of genetically modified food or adopts the US method of cleaning chicken carcasses with strongly chlorinated water. It says: \u201cIf, for example, the UK was tempted after its withdrawal from the EU, to take a different approach to GMOs or chlorinated chickens [as we have read might be the case] this would considerably complicate its trade with the EU 27.\u201d However, the MEPs appear to take solace in the suggestion that the British government will be unable to take advantage of third countries seeking other options. They write: \u201cOne may wonder, in particular, whether the UK will have the sheer capacity to handle so many urgent trade negotiations in parallel with a national administration which has lost the experience and knowhow of such negotiations since the mid 1970s.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Helped by some positive economic news and a strong start on Wall Street - partly due to President Trump talking again about forthcoming tax reforms - European markets ended the day higher. The FTSE 100 was boosted by a weaker pound, with the dollar lifted by the prospect of higher interest rates after comments from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen in the last two days. Banks and mining companies were both among the main gainers. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 33.85 points or 0.47% at 7302.41 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.19% to 11,793.93 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.59% at 4924.86 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.78% at 9584.1 But Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.69% to 19,056.16 In Greece the Athens market dropped 1.11% to 626.29 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 82 points or 0.4%. On that note it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece, EU economic affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici has completed a flying visit to Athens on an upbeat note saying the impasse between Greece and its creditors can soon be resolved. Helena Smith reports: Emerging from a series of back-to-back meetings in Athens, the French commissioner expressed optimism that friction over the country\u2019s latest bailout review would be resolved although the likelihood of that happening by February 20 when euro zone finance ministers next meet is almost impossible. Following talks with prime minister Alexis Tsipras, Moscovici emphasized the need for Greeks \u201cto see a light at the end of the austerity tunnel.\u201d Earlier he had told reporters after a \u201cvery constructive\u201d 30-minute meeting with finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos that Greece\u2019s place was at the heart of the euro zone. \u2018The fiscal targets can be met and overachieved\u2026 the will to go to a solution is there \u2026 and where there is a will there is a way.\u201d But despite the upbeat tone, Moscovici also insisted on the need for reform and said efforts were required \u201cfrom all sides.\u201d That a compromise will come in the form of Greece accepting to implement additional austerity, however, is far from assured. Tsipras took to twitter to welcome Moscovici insisting that \u201cthe time has come to recognise all the sacrifices of the Greek people.\u201d \u201cWe can talk about reforms but enough with austerity,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI am sure the European Commission will be an important partner in the alliance of logic that we need today in Europe.\u201d To break the impasse that has arisen over demands Athens adopts further austerity \u2013 in addition to the painful measures it has already enforced and committed to \u2013 insiders say the leftist-led government is holding out for a multi-layered compromise agreement. In exchange for \u20ac3.6bn worth of extra cuts (not least the lowering of the tax threshold) it wants guaranteed trade-offs such as a debt relief road map, the promise of participation in the ECB\u2019s QE programme and a lower primary surplus target. Yellen is asked that, if there is success in deporting all the undocumented immigrants, what would be the impact on economy. Yellen says: Immigration has been an important part of labour force growth in the US for some time. One factor responsible for slowing growth is slower labour force growth and a radical change in immigration would certainly effect the potential of the economy to grow. US markets continue to hold onto most of their gains following Trump\u2019s tax and regulation comments. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Bang on cue, and no doubt with an eye to outshine Janet Yellen, Donald Trump offered a tantalising foretaste of planned tax reforms that sent the Dow soaring to new record highs. The DJIA just bounced off 20,604 level after the president said he will greatly reduce taxes. Markets are taking this as the fodder they need for a fresh pop higher. He was short on details but based on what we\u2019ve seen so far from this radical president there is no reason to think that the tax plans will be anything less than a major shift in US fiscal policy. Major pro-business tax reform has been on the cards but today\u2019s comments reiterate the president\u2019s intentions. Asked about border adjustment tax and its effect on the economy, Yellen says I don\u2019t think its appropriate for me to weigh in on specifics on this policy. On regulation, Yellen says the Fed is concerned about regulatory burden and if that was not clear she wants to clarify it. (There has been a lot of talk about Dodd Frank and the regulations which were put in place to try and improve the banking system after the financial crisis, with some senators calling for their removal a la Trump and some saying they have protected investors. Yellen is not keen on rolling back on Dodd Frank but clearly feels the need to avoid being seen as putting unnecessary burdens on business.) Back with Yellen and she is asked about her potential relationship with the new Treasury secretary, the ex-Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin. She says she looks forward to a strong working relationship with Mnuchin. US markets seem to be reacting more to Trump than Yellen: Senator McHenry, who wrote to Yellen calling on the Fed to halt talks over international agreements about banking regulations until President Donald Trump has a chance to review their work and replace top negotiators, repeats his question. Yellen: Nothing is a rule that is effective in US until regulatory agencies have gone through the normal rule making process. Nothing binds the Fed to carry out agreements in our our rule making in US. In some cases we don\u2019t agree with the outcomes and have no intention of putting [them] in place. He asks if the Fed will wait for the new regulators to be in place, and takes from Yellen\u2019s reply that the answer is no. Back with Yellen, and the questions seem more directly political and partisan than a day earlier, with some interruptions when the Fed chair is answering: Meanwhile President Trump is talking again about chopping regulations and his tax reforms: Away from Yellen, and US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week, as did gasoline inventories. Crude stocks rose by 9.5m barrels compared to analyst forecasts of a 3.5m increase. Gasoline inventories rose by 2.8m barrels, better than the 752,000 drop expected. After various comments and questions on Dodd Frank as per Tuesday, next up is Senator Barr who asks what the \u201cserial failure of the Fed\u2019s forecasts on the economy\u201d tells us about the Fed\u2019s policy. Yellen says the Fed focuses on maximising unemployment not economic growth. Economic growth is disappointing but unemployment has come down substantially. We are close to meeting our labour market goals. The reason [for the growth performance] is that productivity growth in the US economy has been disappointing. (Much as she said on Tuesday) Janet Yellen has begun her second day of testimony, and is giving the same opening remarks as on Tuesday, pointing to a US rate hike before long. With US inflation and retail sales pointing to an interest rate rise - which could dampen earnings at American companies - investors are playing it cautiously at the start of US trading and ahead of Janet Yellen\u2019s latest testimony. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 20 points or 0.1% but the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.09% lower and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.07%. More US data, showing industrial production unexpectedly fell in January. Warm weather meant a drop in output from utilities, offsetting rises in manufacturing and mining. So the Federal Reserve\u2019s industrial production index dipped 0.3% compared to expectations that it would remain flat. In December the index showed a rise of 0.6%, itself marked down from an initial reading of 0.8%. (The above shows the December figure before the revision) A reminder that Fed chair Janet Yellen will be up before the financial services committee of the House of Representatives in just under an hour\u2019s time. Rob Carnell at ING Bank reckons the figures mean the Fed is now more likely to raise rates at its next meeting in March: Whilst headline inflation gains can be put down to the impact of helpful base effects, the rise in the core rate, coupled with a better trend in wages growth, sends a clear message that the US economy is now running a little hot, the labour market is tight, and the time for inaction and caution from the Fed is over. Janet Yellen sounded a little more hawkish in her Senate testimony, and that got markets toying again with the idea of a March rate hike. But the data is now doing her work for her, and should push expectations further in this direction. The conclusion we reach from the inflation data is supported also by activity data \u2013 in the form of a further strong retail sales figure...The probability of a March Fed hike implied from the Fed funds curve is 42%. We don\u2019t need much more of a push for a March hike to become the market base case. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to the surge in the cost of living in America. Paul Sirani, Chief Market Analyst at Xtrade. \u201cToday\u2019s figures showed inflation climbed to a five-year high, with the US economy continuing to walk down the same path that led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December. \u201cUnder the current levels of inflationary pressure, all eyes will be on Fed Chair Janet Yellen, with investors pencilling in March for the first rate hike of a possible three. \u201cHowever, uncertainty continues to plague the political landscape, and Yellen will seek further clarity of President Trump\u2019s policies before making a decision when they convene next month.\u201d Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen suggested on Tuesday that interest rate rises would be \u201cappropriate\u201d if the US economy carries on as expected, and this new data can only confirm that belief. (Yellen is due to give the second part of her testimony later but it is likely to be much the same as the previous session.) Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Fed Chair Janet Yellen has indicated that interest rate rises are very much in her plans for the US economy in the year ahead, and today\u2019s inflation data will only serve to underline her stance. Inflation sailed past the Fed\u2019s two per cent target and with economic growth expected to tighten, Yellen may well intervene on multiple occasions in the coming months. The question many investors will be grappling with is when, and not if, rates rise. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, said: Yellen did not provide an explicit timeline in relation to interest rate hike and she is not going to do that today as well. Her job in these events is to manage the market expectations for any future interest rate... However, the CPI data released today has increased more pressure on her and she will be quizzed more intensively. Having said that, we anticipate that the Fed will be able to fire another bullet during the next quarter (when it comes to the interest rate). Yes, sturdy growth and eroding slack in the jobs market are validating the Fed\u2019s economic forecasts, but the wild card is still the Trump\u2019s fiscal and tax plans. The Fed has removed the reference to transitory energy factors from their statement, and for us, it sends the signal that they are confident in achieving their mandate inflation target. But there were some worse than expected outcomes in the day\u2019s data: Boom! Two pieces of US economic data have just hit the wires and moved the markets. The big news is that America\u2019s inflation rate has hit a four-year high last month, jumping from 2.1% to 2.5%. On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.6% - twice as fast as expected - as households paid more for petrol (oh ok, gasoline) and food. Retail sales have also smashed forecasts, growing by 0.4% last month - or 0.8% if you exclude automobile sales. Investors are betting that this data puts more pressure on the US central bank to raise interest rates in March. That\u2019s driven up the yield, or interest rates, on US 10-year government bonds. The dollar is also surging, sending the pound reeling to just $1.238 - down almost a whole cent today. But there is a fly in the soup -- average weekly earnings paid to US private workers fell by 0.4% in January. As in Britain, employees aren\u2019t getting the full benefits of the recovery..... Nick Macpherson, former top civil servant at the Treasury, makes an interesting point about today\u2019s employment report -- there are now more job vacancies than people claiming jobless benefit. According to the ONS, there were 751,000 job vacancies for the 3 months to January 2017, while 745,000 people claimed unemployment related benefits in January. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Mike Bird has helpfully plotted both sets of data for us: There is a caveat (as ever...). Advertising job vacancies is cheaper than in the past, thanks to the internet, so employees may be tempted to speculatively offer positions and see who applies. But this could reinforce the point about Britain\u2019s labour market approaching full capacity. But if that\u2019s really true, why aren\u2019t wages accelerating as workers flex their muscles and threaten to walk? One argument is that there\u2019s more slack in the system than the figures suggest (this is the Bank of England\u2019s argument for not raising interest rates). Another is that the traditional relationship between pay and unemployment has broken down since the financial crisis - which doesn\u2019t bode well for wage rises this year.... The slowdown in real pay growth is causing concern in business, as well as in Westminster -- and prompting calls for government action. Even the CBI, whose members are in a decent position to raise salaries among the ranks, are worried. Rachel Smith, their principal labour market economist, argues that productivity (a long-running problem in Britain) needs to improve. And she singles out business rates as a big concern. \u201cPay growth remains stubbornly sluggish, which is a concern given rising inflation. There are tentative signs that productivity is picking up, but there is further to go before it can underpin faster wage growth. \u201cCompanies will be looking to the Budget to see adjustments to business rates along with measures to boost educational performance, helping firms to drive faster productivity growth.\u201d The rates paid by many businesses are going up sharply in the next few years, with the City of London facing a \u00a31.4bn bill. That\u2019s going to leave less money for pay rises. Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams is also sounding the alarm on living standards: \u201cWe welcome the overall increase in employment but are concerned that wide regional differences in the numbers of people in work remain. \u201cIt is also worrying to see that rising living costs are quickly catching up with wage growth. If this trend continues, the Government\u2019s abysmal record on living standards will get even worse.\u201d The Joseph Rowntree Foundation have seized on today\u2019s wage figures to hammer home their warning that millions more people risk being dragged into poverty by rising inflation. JRF says: \u201cRecord employment in the economy is welcome and work has to be the best route out of poverty. But we know employment alone will not always help people reach a decent standard of living. \u201cOur analysis today shows four million more people over the last six years have fallen below a decent leaving standard, meaning they are struggling to make ends meet. \u201cTackling the high cost of living is crucial to helping just managing families, particularly with a challenging outlook: inflation is likely to average 2.6% this year, in sharp contrast to the very low inflation of recent times. \u201cGovernment focus on modest incomes is welcome, but there is a fine margin between just managing today and poverty tomorrow.\u201d JRF\u2019s report on the millions of \u2018Just about managing\u2019 families who don\u2019t earn enough for a decent standard of living has caused quite a stir today. It shows that some 30% of the population, or 19 million people, are living below the nationally-recognised minimum income standard (MIS) -- defined as having enough money to afford adequate housing, food and clothes. Here\u2019s our take: And here\u2019s Jo Michell, economics lecturer at Bristol Business School: Sam Tombs, economist at Pantheon, flags up that employment growth has slowed. As mentioned earlier, the UK created another 37,000 jobs in the last quarter. That\u2019s the weakest performance since the second quarter of 2015. This chart, from Eshe Nelson of Quartz, shows how real wage growth has slowed as inflation (in purple) catches up with earnings growth (in blue). Real wages are only growing if the blue line is above the purple one -- something that didn\u2019t happen between 2010 and 2014. There could be serious implications for the UK economy if inflation keeps biting into wages, taking real wage growth below today\u2019s two-year low. A real pay squeeze could hurt consumer spending, which has been driving growth since the EU referendum. Andrew Sentance, senior economic advisor of PwC, explains: With wage growth relatively subdued and consumer price inflation now up to 1.8% and set to rise further towards 3% by the end of 2017, the healthy real earnings growth we saw in 2015 and most of 2016 could soon be a thing of the past. \u201cThis is likely to take the edge off consumer spending growth later this year and into 2018, which has been the main source of resilience in the UK economy since the Brexit vote. Gerwyn Davies, Labour Market Adviser at the CIPD, the professional body for HR and people development, is concerned by the fall in real wage growth: \u201cThe record number of people in employment is, of course, good news. However there are a number of underlying factors that remain problematic, for example the fall in real wage growth from 1.7% to 1.4% over the last three months. This is especially concerning given the prospect of rising inflation in 2017. Davies is also struck by the drop in EU nationals working in Britain (see 9.57am post). It\u2019s a sign that the EU referendum result is now having an impact on the economy, he agues: \u201cThe figures also offer further evidence that Brexit has had a discernable impact on the allure of the UK as a place to live and work. The sharp growth in the number of non-UK nationals from the EU in work in the UK ground to a sudden halt in the second half of the year and has actually fallen in the last quarter. \u201cAs a result, employers in sectors that employ relatively large numbers of EU nationals, which also account for a sizeable proportion of vacancies, are likely to come under further recruitment pressures if, as we expect, this trend continues. As our Labour Market Outlook showed, the demand for labour is likely to remain strong in the near-term, which is reflected by the high number of vacancies reported in this month\u2019s figures.\u201c These charts from Resolution also show how real earnings growth has slowed.... ...and how the average worker has never reclaimed the pay growth lost in the financial crisis. The Resolution Foundation has bad news for UK workers -- they think the squeeze on wages will continue this year. With inflation set to keep rising, real pay rises will be dragged below the 1.4% reported today. Resolution\u2019s latest pay projection show that real pay growth is set to fall to around 1 per cent next month, less than half the pre-crisis average of 2.2 per cent. Laura Gardiner, Senior Policy Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, explains: \u201cToday\u2019s figures show the jobs market remains robust, with employment reaching a new record high and inactivity starting to fall again. \u201cHowever, the encouraging news on jobs isn\u2019t feeding through into earnings, which have shown no sign of responding to fast-rising inflation. Unless this changes Britain is set for a fresh pay squeeze later this year. This chart shows their latest forecasts: Professor Geraint Johnes, Director of Research at The Work Foundation \u2013 part of Lancaster University - also fears that wages are being squeezed by the rising cost of living. He says: The rate of price inflation may soon outstrip wage growth, putting a squeeze on wages. Indeed, the single month figure exceeds 2.5% only in construction.\u201d Today\u2019s report also shows that real wage growth in the UK economy has now fallen to a two-year low, putting more pressure on households. That\u2019s because average earnings only rose by 2.6% in October-December, while inflation averaged 1.2% over the quarter (and has climbed to 1.8% in January!). That means real wages, accounting for inflation, only rose by 1.4% in the last year. The TUC is urging the government to take more action - including ending the pay squeeze on public sector workers. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: \u201cWith prices rising faster, real pay growth is now slowing down. This will be worrying for families whose have still not seen their living standards recover following the financial crisis. \u201cNext month\u2019s Budget must set out a clear plan for preventing another fall in living standards. The Chancellor should tackle insecurity at work, invest in infrastructure and skills, and end the current pay restrictions on nurses, teachers and other key workers.\u201d This chart plots the UK unemployment rate over the last 45 years (in blue), and also the rates for men (yellow) and women (red) It shows that the overall unemployment rate has dropped from 8.4% in 2011 to just 4.8% at the end of last year, the lowest since mid-2005 (not 2006 as I initially wrote earlier, sorry). Here\u2019s Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green on today\u2019s jobs report: \u201cWith employment at its highest rate since records began, and unemployment at its lowest in over a decade, we remain in a position of strength. \u201cOur ongoing welfare reforms will continue to incentivise work and make sure the system is fair to all those who need it and those who pay for it. With youth unemployment down, women in work at record levels and number of disabled people in work increasing too, we\u2019re delivering on our pledge to build a country that works for everyone.\u201d The Department of Work and Pensions are tweeting some positive points from today\u2019s jobs report: Today\u2019s jobs report also shows how the number of non-UK nationals working in Britain has grown over the last two decades, from almost 4% of the workforce to nearly 11%. The ONS says that between October to December 2015 and October to December 2016: UK nationals working in the UK increased by 70,000 to 28.44 million non-UK nationals working in the UK increased by 233,000 to 3.48 million And since October to December 1997.... the number of non-UK nationals working in the UK increased from just over 1 million to 3.48 million the proportion of all people working in the UK accounted for by non-UK nationals increased from 3.8% to 10.9% this increase in non-UK nationals working in the UK reflects the admission of several new member states to the European Union (EU) Today\u2019s labour market report also shows a small drop in the number of EU workers in the UK, in the final three months of 2016. Does that show that the Brexit vote is having an effect? Possibly....but we should be cautious here, as these figures aren\u2019t seasonally adjusted. The ONS says: \u201cThe data on non-UK nationals and non-UK born workers is not seasonally adjusted, so the small drop in the number of workers born in other EU countries, and small rise in the number of non-EU-born workers should be treated with caution. These figures may be affected by seasonal patterns in employment. \u201cThe first migration figures that include a post-referendum period will be published on 23 February, when ONS will release migration statistics for the year ended September 2016.\u201d With the employment total at a record high, and the unemployment rate at an 11-year low, Britain\u2019s labour force appears to be approaching full capacity. So argues ONS senior statistician David Freeman, anyway, who says: \u201cContinued moderate growth in employment has led to a new high in the total employment rate, while the rate for women has reached 70% for the first time on record. Overall, the labour market appears to be edging towards full capacity. This chart shows how wages growth slowed in the last month: Here\u2019s a snapshot of the UK jobs report over the last year: BREAKING: Britain\u2019s jobless rate remains at an 11-year low of 4.8% as firms keep hiring workers, but wage growth has slowed. The labour report, just released, shows that: Britain\u2019s unemployment rate was 4.8% in the three months to December, remaining at its lowest level since 2005. The number of people in work jumped by 37,000 in the three months to December, meaning there are now 31.84 million people in work - 302,000 more than for a year earlier. That\u2019s a new record high. The number of people out of work fell by 7,000 in the three months to December, taking the total down to 1.6 million. But.... wages growth was weaker than expected. Average earnings excluding bonuses rose by 2.6% in the last quarter, down from 2.7% a month ago. And including bonuses, earnings also rose by 2.6% - down from 2.8%. Details and reaction to follow.... The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has issued a chilling warning today that a third of people in Britain are living on inadequate incomes that don\u2019t provide an adequate standard of living. It\u2019s a timely reminder that the unemployment rate, although important, doesn\u2019t give a full view of the state of the UK economy. An extra four million people have fallen into this bracket since 2008, according to JRF, because the cost of living has outpaced earnings since the financial crisis stuck. JRF says: The number of individuals below the Minimum Income Standard (MIS) rose by four million, from 15 million to 19 million (from 25 to 30 per cent of the population). There are 11 million people living far short of MIS, up from 9.1 million, who have incomes below 75% of the standard and are at high risk of being in poverty. The remaining eight million fall short of the minimum, by a smaller amount, and despite having a more modest risk of poverty, are just about managing at best. More than half of the households affected actually have at least one person in work -- but not being paid enough to provide a decent standard of living: JRF fears that many more people will be dragged into this situation, if wages don\u2019t rise to keep pace with inflation: And here\u2019s Business Insider\u2019s take: Over in Greece, commissioner Pierre Moscovici has claimed Athens and her creditors are making progress towards finally concluding its latest bailout review. Moscovici struck an upbeat tone this morning, before a meeting with finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos. He told reporters that: \u201cThere is convergence at certain points so that we can conclude the review and move ahead. Some more small steps remain.\u201d Those \u2018small steps\u2019 involve the measures which Greece must take before its creditors are satisfied that it is meeting the terms of its bailout, and hand over \u20ac7bn in fresh loans. Moscovici has also tweeted that he\u2019s picked up an award from Greece\u2019s president this morning: European stocks are rallying (again) in early trading. Investors are cheered by yesterday\u2019s testimony by US central bank chief Janet Yellen, and her largely upbeat view of the American economy. Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies has hit a fresh record high, up 0.2% to 18,825, and there are solid gains in Frankfurt and Paris: Yellen\u2019s hint that interest rates will rise soon is pushing bank shares higher, and her lack of anxiety over the US jobs market is also boosting confidence. Traders also seem to be clinging to hopes that Donald Trump will provide an economic boost by cutting taxes and boosting infrastructure spending, rather than fretting about the unfolding scandal about links to Russia and the sudden departure of national security adviser Michael Flynn.... Today\u2019s average earnings figures are particularly important, argues Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: With inflation on the rise the most talked about figure this Wednesday will likely be the wage growth reading, which is set to remain unchanged at 2.8% [including bonuses] That\u2019s all well and good for now, but given that UK inflation could hit 3% at some point in the second half of 2017 growth needs to pick up to avoid severely pinched pockets across the country. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s jobs market is in the spotlight today, with the publication of new unemployment figures at 9.30am GMT. The figures will be scrutinised for signs that the labour force is starting to suffer from last year\u2019s Brexit vote. They\u2019ll also show whether people\u2019s pay is keeping up with inflation, which rose to 1.8% from 1.6% last month. Economists expect a fairly solid set of figures, with the headline unemployment rate likely to remain unchanged at 4.8%, an 11-year low. But the claimant count is tipped to rise by around 800 people in January, after dropping by 23,000 the previous month. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, are expected to remain unchanged at 2.7% -- or 2.8% if you include bonuses. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains why this matters: With inflationary pressures starting to catch alight it is especially important that wages data keeps up, having been running ahead of inflation since mid-2014. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale suspects that the unemployment total may inch higher too.... A 5k increase in unemployment, and steady ex-bonus wage growth at 2.7% unlikely to move sterling, but soggy enough to keep a mildly bearish bias. Also on today\u2019s agenda... Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will be heading back to Congress for a second day of testimony to US lawmakers, from 3pm GMT. Yesterday she indicated that rate rises are coming, as it would be \u2018unwise\u2019 to wait too long. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici is in Athens today, hoping to narrow the gap between Greece and her creditors over the long-stalled bailout review. On the economic front, we get new US inflation figures at 1.30pm GMT. Economists predict that the CPI rose by 2.4% year-on-year in January, up from 2.1% in December - part of a wider trend of rising inflation. Plus, beer group Heineken, dairy chain Danone and French bank Credit Agricole are all reporting results today.",

      "bodyText": "Tata Steel UK workers have voted in favour of proposals to turn around the struggling business, potentially saving 8,000 jobs but also leading to cuts to their pension benefits. Workers from the Community, Unite, and GMB unions all backed the plan in separate ballots. Approximately three-quarters of votes supported the proposals, which involve saving the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales. Tony Brady, national officer at Unite, said steelworkers had made \u201cgreat sacrifices\u201d to try to protect the company\u2019s future, which has been at risk since Tata Steel announced a review of its operations nearly a year ago. Tata Steel had proposed saving 8,000 jobs in its UK business and the Port Talbot steelworks by investing \u00a31bn in modernising its operations over the next 10 years. This investment depends on spinning off the pension fund into a separate entity and replacing the final salary pension scheme with a less generous contribution scheme. The existing scheme \u2013 the British Steel pension scheme (BSPS) \u2013 could enter the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) as part of the arrangement, which would result in a 10% cut to members\u2019 benefits. For this to occur Tata Steel must convince the Pensions Regulator that its UK business is on the brink of insolvency and is likely to have to pump hundreds of millions of cash into the scheme. Tata Steel has claimed it could not afford to continue supporting the pension scheme. The BSPS has 130,000 members and \u00a315bn of liabilities. It would be by far the biggest pension scheme to be taken on by the PPF. The company, which could merge its European business with German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp once the restructuring is complete, welcomed the vote. \u201cWe recognise this has been a difficult decision for employees. It shows employees are doing everything they can to develop a sustainable future for the business,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe will continue to work with the trade unions and other stakeholders to deliver Tata Steel UK\u2019s transformation plan and develop a sustainable future for the business.\u201d Union leaders said Tata Steel now had to deliver on its proposals but also called on the government to provide more support for the industry. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, said: \u201cSteelworkers have taken a tough decision and have shown they are determined to safeguard jobs and secure the long-term future of steelmaking. Nobody wanted to be in this situation, but as we have always said, it is vital that we now work together to protect the benefits already accrued and prevent the BSPS from free-falling into the PPF. \u201cWe now expect Tata to make good on their promises and deliver the investment plan for the whole of their steel business. The UK government still has an important role to play and we fully expect them to deliver tangible support for steelmaking in the UK.\u201d The jobs have been at risk since last March when Tata Steel announced it was putting its UK business up for sale amid losses of more than \u00a31m a day. The decision sparked a political crisis as the government scrambled to secure the future of the Port Talbot plant. Port Talbot is one of only two sites in Britain that makes steel in blast furnaces. The government welcomed the result of the vote. A spokesperson said: \u201cThis positive vote is an important step forward for the future of Port Talbot and Tata Steel in the UK and it is now vital that all parties work together to deliver on the agreed proposals. \u201cIt is testament to the commitment of its workforce that they are willing to work so constructively with the owners to secure the future of the plant. The government will play its role in supporting the steel industry to help deliver a sustainable future.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "European parliament passes EU-Canada free trade deal amid protests", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European parliament has passed the controversial EU-Canada free trade deal, while protesters staged a sit-in at the gates of the building in Strasbourg, France. The agreement was celebrated by some as a victory for global free trade in the face of growing US protectionism under the government of Donald Trump. The agreement aims to eliminate 98% of tariffs on exported goods, making it the EU\u2019s most comprehensive trade deal to date. Trade between the two sides amounts to more than 60bn euros (C$83bn) a year, and the EU expects the so-called Ceta deal (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) to boost this by 20% by removing almost all tariffs. Supporters claim the pact will be worth \u00a31.3bn (C$2.1bn, $1.6bn) a year to Britain alone, in the period before the UK withdraws from the EU. The EU commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, called it \u201can important milestone\u201d and said \u201cEU companies and citizens will start to reap the benefits the agreement offers as soon as possible\u201d. Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the ALDE liberal group, said: \u201cPresident Trump has given us another good reason to intensify our links with Canada. While Trump introduces tariffs, we are not only tearing them down but also setting the highest progressive standards.\u201d Also included in the deal, however, are provisions allowing companies greater access to public contracts and sustainable development clauses, prompting some MEPs in the green and socialist political groups in the European parliament to claim it will lead to the wholescale privatisation of the public sector. Unlike classic trade deals, Ceta harmonises regulations on matters such as health and the environment. Protesters attempted to disrupt the vote, with about 700 people marching outside parliament to voice their opposition. Anti-globalisation activists dressed in surgical masks blocked the entrance to the parliament building, before being dragged off by riot police. Despite the concerns, after three hours of debate, MEPs in Strasbourg approved the pact with 408 votes in favour, 254 against and 33 abstentions. \u201cThis is a watershed moment \u2013 EU trade policy will never be the same again,\u201d said the senior Scottish MEP David Martin, whose Socialists and Democrats group split on the issue. Approval by the parliament allows the provisional implementation of Ceta as early as next month, although the Netherlands could conceivably still block the deal if it demands an advisory national referendum. On Thursday, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, will address MEPs in parliament to celebrate the breakthrough. The leader of the centre-right EPP group in parliament, Manfred Weber, claimed that the agreement stood in stark contrast to the policies of \u201cbuilding walls\u201d endorsed by President Trump. EU states and Canada formally signed the deal in October after seven years of tough negotiation, overcoming last-minute resistance from the Belgian Walloon parliament, which sought to block its national government from approving the accord. Latvian MEP Artis Pabriks, a conservative from the EPP group who sponsored the law, said: \u201cBy adopting Ceta, we chose openness and growth and high standards over protectionism and stagnation.\u201d Some industries are left untouched by the deal, such as audiovisual and transport services and a select few agricultural products, including dairy, which is tightly regulated in Canada. A major flashpoint for opponents is the proposal to set up special courts to settle disputes between investors and national authorities. Opponents believe this provision hands too much power to the corporate giants and their lawyers. \u201cMultinationals will be able to attack governments in a privatised court system,\u201d said France\u2019s far-right presidential candidate and MEP Marine Le Pen, who voted against Ceta. The deal\u2019s EU negotiator, Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem, told MEPs that \u201cnothing in this agreement undermines a government\u2019s right to regulate in the public interest\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 February 2017. An earlier version said the dairy industry was \u201cheavily subsidised\u201d in Canada, where \u201ctightly regulated\u201d was meant. Canada operates a supply management system.",

      "bodyText": "The vast majority of employment growth was driven by non-UK nationals in the final three months of 2016 compared with a year earlier, the latest official figures on the labour market revealed. Of the 303,000 more people in work between October and December compared with a year earlier, 233,000 were non-UK nationals, taking the total to 3.48 million according to the Office for National Statistics. UK nationals working in Britain increased by 70,000 over the same period to 28.44 million. Over the past two decades, the number of non-UK nationals working in Britain has increased by more than a million, taking the proportion of the workforce from 3.8% to 10.9%, partly reflecting the expansion of the EU as new member states were admitted. The figures are likely to be seized upon ahead of the Stoke-on-Trent and Copeland by-elections next week. Both constituencies voted decisively for Brexit in the EU referendum last June. Labour market expert John Philpott said there was little sign of an \u201cexodus\u201d of EU workers following the Brexit vote. \u201cThe level of EU-born people working in the UK was more or less flat in the second half of last year. While this may suggest the UK is no longer the draw it once was for EU migrants, Brexit has yet to trigger a big EU labour exit.\u201d The latest jobs report also revealed that Britain\u2019s workers are struggling to get pay rises despite record levels of employment, with commentators warning that UK families are facing the prospect of a fresh squeeze in living standards over the next year. Pay growth excluding bonuses slowed unexpectedly to 2.6% between October and December, from 2.7% between September and November, despite a record employment rate of 74.6% and a labour market that is \u201cedging towards full capacity\u201d according to the ONS. Real pay growth of 1.4% was the slowest in two years, as the gap narrows between inflation \u2013 which is rising \u2013 and the rate of wage increases. Frances O\u2019Grady, TUC general secretary, said: \u201cWith prices rising faster, real pay growth is now slowing down. This will be worrying for families whose have still not seen their living standards recover following the financial crisis. Next month\u2019s budget must set out a clear plan for preventing another fall in living standards.\u201d James Smith, economist at ING, said the latest report would \u201cring alarm bells\u201d for consumers. Fuel and food prices pushed up the headline inflation rate from 1.6% in December to 1.8% in January, the highest in more than two years. Inflation is expected to reach about 3% over the next 12 months as the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote drives up the cost of goods imported from abroad. Laura Gardiner, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cThe encouraging news on jobs isn\u2019t feeding through into earnings, which have shown no sign of responding to fast-rising inflation. Unless this changes Britain is set for a fresh pay squeeze later this year.\u201d The number of people in work rose by 37,000 the final quarter of 2016 compared with the previous quarter, to 31.8 million. The employment rate among women hit 70% for the first time since records began in 1971. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, tweeted: \u201cEncouraging labour market stats out today; record high employment rate and youth unemployment at its lowest level for more than 12 years.\u201d The unemployment rate remained unchanged at an 11-year low of 4.8% between October and December, with the number of people out of work falling by 7,000 to 1.6 million. In January, the number of people claiming jobless benefits fell unexpectedly by 42,000 to 745,000. Economists had predicted a small rise of 800. Debbie Abrahams, Labour\u2019s shadow work and pensions secretary, welcomed the rise in employment but said it was worrying to see that rising living costs were catching up with wage growth. \u201cIf this trend continues, the government\u2019s abysmal record on living standards will get even worse,\u201d she said. \u201cWith wages set to be lower in 2021 than before the Tories came to power, they must now act to stop the growing pressure on low and middle income families.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Len McCluskey, leader of the UK\u2019s biggest union, has warned that it will oppose job losses at Vauxhall, as the chief executive of US parent company General Motors flew to Germany for talks about the sale of its struggling European car-making business. General Motors is in talks to sell its European arm Opel, which includes the UK\u2019s Vauxhall, to France\u2019s PSA Group, which owns Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn, after branding Brexit a \u201cspeed bump\u201d that was hindering efforts to turn around the loss-making division. The GM chief executive, Mary Barra, and its president, Dan Ammann, flew to Germany on Wednesday for talks at Opel\u2019s headquarters in R\u00fcsselsheim am Main, near Frankfurt. GM\u2019s Vauxhall factories in Luton in Bedfordshire and Ellesmere Port in Cheshire employ about 4,500 staff. Thousands more jobs rely on its UK supply chain. Opel, founded in 1862, has a workforce of about 35,600 across Europe, including 18,250 in Germany. The UK business secretary, Greg Clark, spoke to Ammann on Tuesday and met McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, on Wednesday to discuss the potential sale of Opel. Clark is pushing for urgent meetings with PSA to seek assurances for the UK factories. Clark said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s automotive sector is one of the most productive in the world and we want to see it go from strength to strength. The government will continue to make the case for keeping manufacturing in the UK.\u201d McCluskey said Britain could not allow the future of car workers\u2019 jobs to be decided by PSA, which is 15% owned by the French government. He also insisted Unite would \u201cnot accept any job losses or plant closures\u201d. \u201cThe UK market is largest market in the EU for Vauxhall-Opel, so GM does have a moral obligation not to turn its back on the communities and workers who have helped make this company what it is today,\u201d McCluskey said. Berlin vowed to intervene to protect German jobs if the deal went ahead. \u201cFrom our perspective, Opel is an innovative company with a long history in Germany. There are important sites here, in production as well as in research and development, whose future matters to us,\u201d said a spokesman for the chancellor, Angela Merkel. It was unclear whether Merkel would meet with PSA\u2019s chief executive, Carlos Tavares, who has built a reputation as a cost cutter at the French company. A PSA spokesman told Agence France-Presse that Tavares hoped to launch a \u201csocial dialogue\u201d with worker representatives in Germany, as well as meeting with Merkel. Germany\u2019s labour minister, Andrea Nahles, stressed that Opel\u2019s headquarters must remain in R\u00fcsselsheim. She said there were talks at all levels with Opel, GM and PSA to ensure the future of Opel\u2019s three factories in Germany, adding that the issue had been discussed at a cabinet meeting by the German government. The German economy minister, Brigitte Zypries, was scheduled to speak to her French counterpart, Michel Sapin, about the deal on Wednesday. She said it was unacceptable that PSA and Opel had not consulted German government officials, unions or the Opel works council before pushing ahead with talks. McCluskey repeated his call for the government to extend the backing it has offered to Nissan, to ensure it maintains its UK car production when the UK leaves the EU, to the rest of Britain\u2019s car industry. The Japanese carmaker announced in October that it would invest in its Sunderland factory after receiving assurances from the government. The Unite chief said he would speak to GM \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d to find out what its plans were in relation to the UK workforce , as well as speaking to Peugeot. McCluskey appealed to the UK government for help, saying: \u201cIt cannot be that the future of UK car workers\u2019 jobs now lie in the hands of the French government and their backing for Peugeot. The UK government has to offer at least equal but actually better backing for UK workers.\u201d GM, the world\u2019s third largest carmaker and the biggest in the US, has racked up more than $15bn of losses at Opel since 2000. It nearly sold the division after going bankrupt in 2009 and the Ellesmere Port Vauxhall factory \u2013 dubbed\u201chome of the Astra\u201d \u2013 came very close to closure in 2012. Its future was only assured after the then business secretary, Vince Cable, flew to the US to reassure GM bosses that the government was committed to the car industry. McCluskey said: \u201cIt does seem as if Brexit is a factor in GM\u2019s thinking as its UK business relies heavily on its links throughout the EU supply chain. Without a shadow of doubt, UK car plants must be offered the same assurances as those given by the government to Nissan. But, as I stressed to the minister, we need the government to be clearly committed to securing access to the single market for the UK auto industry. \u201cThis can be done, in our view, while controlling access to the labour market, so it is vital that the government thinks again about its priorities for UK manufacturing. It also makes it even more vital that the government takes this opportunity to work with the sector to bring the production of car components back to the UK, so that we can run our businesses without facing bruising tariffs.\u201d",

Without a shadow of doubt, UK car plants must be offered the same assurances as those given by the government to Nissan. But, as I stressed to the minister, we need the government to be clearly committed to securing access to the single market for the UK auto industry.</p> <p>\u201cThis can be done, in our view, while controlling access to the labour market, so it is vital that the government thinks again about its priorities for UK manufacturing. It also makes it even more vital that the government takes this opportunity to work with the sector to bring the production of car components back to the UK, so that we can run our businesses without facing bruising tariffs.\u201d</p>",

It would carry environmental risks and impose significant financial costs on the Bank, and thereby the taxpayer, and on the cash industry.\u201d A row broke out about the new plastic \u00a35 banknotes last November, after it emerged that they contained tallow, an animal byproduct of beef or mutton fat. A petition urging the Bank to stop using the substance in its banknotes attracted nearly 135,000 signatures. It said the use of animal fat was \u201cunacceptable to millions of vegans, vegetarians, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and others in the UK\u201d. A vegetarian cafe in Cambridge stopped taking the \u00a35 note, and some Hindu temples in the UK also banned it. Satish K Sharma, general secretary of the National Council of Hindu Temples, said he was surprised that the Bank decided to push ahead with production of the \u00a310 note after his meeting with the chief cashier, Victoria Cleland, in January. He described it as a \u201cmajor blow\u201d \u2013 with temples, as charities, relying on financial donations. Sharma branded the new banknotes a \u201cmeans of exchange which is contrary to the principle of non-violence\u201d. He explained that while people could choose not to eat meat, a currency made with animal fat left no choice. \u201cIt\u2019s being imposed. It\u2019s a loss of a religious and moral and ethical freedom.\u201d He said the council would be seeking legal advice. The Bank said it had carefully considered other options, such as destroying, reprinting and delaying the issue of the \u00a310 note, but concluded it would be too costly. It is looking at switching to an alternative substance, such as palm oil or coconut oil, for the planned \u00a320 polymer note and the next batch of \u00a35 notes, but the switch would come too late for the new plastic tenner. The Bank said it had already printed 275m \u00a310 notes, at a cost of \u00a324m, in preparation for their launch in the autumn (it plans to print 1.2bn notes in total ). It has also spent \u00a346m printing the 440m plastic \u00a35 notes. Reprinting these notes would mean incurring these costs again, and there would be a further \u00a350,000 cost for the secure destruction of the existing stock. The central bank said: \u201cThe Bank works hard to ensure that the public has enough secure notes to use in daily life and destroying the hundreds of millions of notes already printed would put this at risk. The Bank cannot guarantee sufficient stocks of paper notes to replace the destroyed polymer notes. \u201cAfter careful consideration the Bank has concluded that the severity of the combined impact of the factors outlined outweigh potential harm caused.\u201d The flexible plastic film for the banknotes is made by Innovia in Wigton, Cumbria, and they are printed by De La Rue in Essex. The Bank said it had not known tallow would be used to make the \u00a35 and \u00a310 notes when it signed the contract with Innovia. It has postponed signing a contract for the production of the plastic \u00a320 note, which is to be issued by 2020, and has spoken to Innovia and other polymer suppliers about making it with a plant-based alternative. Suppliers have said it should not affect the quality of the banknotes, though this would still need be tested in production trials in coming months. The Vegan Society said it was \u201cunfortunate that the new \u00a310 note will contain tallow\u201d, but added: \u201cWe have met with the Bank of England and believe they are committed to solving this problem and we will continue to work with them to find a good solution. \u201cWe look forward to the consultation around the \u00a320 note and hope that any future bank notes will be free from ingredients produced through harming animals.

    "webTitle": "Missing wage rises give lie to picture of full employment | Larry Elliott", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain has all the hallmarks of a full-employment economy. The employment rate is at a record level, unemployment is at its lowest in more than a decade, and the percentage of women working is at its highest since modern records began. The one thing missing from this picture is an increase in wages. Full-employment economies are normally good for workers because they take advantage of labour shortages to strike better deals with employers. Yet this is not happening in the UK. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that employment was up in the final three months of 2016 but the rate of growth in earnings slipped back. The fact that the slowdown occurred while rising inflation was eroding the purchasing power of consumers makes the disparity between jobs and wages even more curious. The obvious conclusion is that Britain is not actually operating at full employment because if it were, earnings would be rising, not falling. Although the unemployment rate is 4.8%, it can come down further without wage inflation starting to rise. As the ONS has pointed out, the proportion of part-time workers who cannot find full-time jobs is markedly above the long-term average. The ONS thinks that this fact, along with the increase in the number of part-timers working in the economy, suggests there is a pool of labour that can be tapped by employers if they are looking to raise output. There has also been a shift towards self-employment in the UK, a rise of almost 300,000 in the past two years. It is a reasonable assumption that many of the 4.8 million people working for themselves are not doing so voluntarily but because they cannot find better paid full-time work. Employers have also been able to find workers from overseas. Between the final three months of 2015 and the final three months of 2016, the number of people employed rose by just over 300,000. Of those, 70,000 were UK nationals and 230,000 were non-UK nationals. The increase in the supply of labour has helped to keep the lid on wage increases. Finally, demand for labour has been tapering off. To be sure, the number of people working was up by 37,000 in the final three months of 2016, but this followed increases of 172,000 in the second quarter and 49,000 in the third. The Bank of England\u2019s regional agents have detected evidence of a lower rate of hiring, and this might be already having an impact on wages. Whatever the explanation, the evidence suggests that there is still spare capacity in the labour market. There is no immediate prospect of the depreciation of sterling triggering the price-wage spiral feared by the Bank of England, which is why interest rates will remain at their current rock-bottom levels. Cheap money, an improving global economy and the impact of the weaker pound on exports will prevent unemployment from rising very much from its current low level. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that it won\u2019t be too long before prices start rising more quickly than wages. Get ready for real incomes to fall and living standards to be hit. Fatty fivers and the Indian Mutiny Not since the Indian Mutiny of 1857 has there been as much fuss about tallow. Back then, Hindu sepoys rebelled because their rifle cartridges were greased with cow fat. This time, the Bank of England has copped it from vegans and religious groups because the new polymer \u00a35 notes contain traces of animal-derived products. With hindsight, Threadneedle Street probably regrets that it did not more carefully check what was used to make the fatty fivers. But more than half the \u00a35 notes in circulation are now made of polymer, and production is well under way for the next generation of \u00a310 notes in preparation for them to be issued in September. The Bank has looked at whether to recall and destroy all the polymer notes, but decided not to do so. That\u2019s the correct decision, because the costs of making the change \u2013 \u00a370m for pulping the notes, higher business costs, potential environmental damage from using palm or coconut oil as an alternative to tallow \u2013 are greater than the benefits. Public funds are not unlimited, and it would be much better value for money to get diesel cars rather than \u00a35 notes out of circulation. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has reported that sales of secondhand diesel cars rose by 11% last year, more than twice as fast as purchases of petrol models. The reason for that is simple: Gordon Brown as chancellor provided tax incentives for buying diesel cars as a way of tackling global warming before the health hazards became clear. Philip Hammond needs to put that right in next month\u2019s budget through a generous scrappage scheme coupled with higher vehicle excise duty on diesel vehicles. Fatty fivers don\u2019t actually kill people. Diesel cars do.",

      "body": "<p>Britain has all the hallmarks of a full-employment economy. The employment rate is at a record level, unemployment is at its lowest in more than a decade, and the percentage of women working is at its highest since modern records began.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/15/pay-growth-slows-record-employment-rate-tuc\">The one thing missing from this picture is an increase in wages</a>. Full-employment economies are normally good for workers because they take advantage of labour shortages to strike better deals with employers.</p> <p>Yet this is not happening in the UK. The latest figures from the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/labourmarketeconomiccommentary/feb2017\">Office for National Statistics</a> show that employment was up in the final three months of 2016 but the rate of growth in earnings slipped back. The fact that the slowdown occurred while rising inflation was eroding the purchasing power of consumers makes the disparity between jobs and wages even more curious.</p> <p>The obvious conclusion is that Britain is not actually operating at full employment because if it were, earnings would be rising, not falling. Although the unemployment rate is 4.8%, it can come down further without wage inflation starting to rise.</p> <p>As the ONS has pointed out, the proportion of part-time workers who cannot find full-time jobs is markedly above the long-term average. The ONS thinks that this fact, along with the increase in the number of part-timers working in the economy, suggests there is a pool of labour that can be tapped by employers if they are looking to raise output.</p> <p>There has also been a shift towards self-employment in the UK, a rise of almost 300,000 in the past two years. It is a reasonable assumption that many of the 4.8 million people working for themselves are not doing so voluntarily but because they cannot find better paid full-time work.</p> <p>Employers have also been able to find workers from overseas. Between the final three months of 2015 and the final three months of 2016, the number of people employed rose by just over 300,000. Of those, 70,000 were UK nationals and 230,000 were non-UK nationals. The increase in the supply of labour has helped to keep the lid on wage increases.</p> <p>Finally, demand for labour has been tapering off. To be sure, the number of people working was up by 37,000 in the final three months of 2016, but this followed increases of 172,000 in the second quarter and 49,000 in the third. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/08/uk-pay-growth-inflation-bank-of-england-economy-brexit\">The Bank of England\u2019s regional agents</a> have detected evidence of a lower rate of hiring, and this might be already having an impact on wages. </p> <p>Whatever the explanation, the evidence suggests that there is still spare capacity in the labour market. There is no immediate prospect of the depreciation of sterling triggering the price-wage spiral feared by the Bank of England, which is why interest rates will remain at their current rock-bottom levels.</p> <p>Cheap money, an improving global economy and the impact of the weaker pound on exports will prevent unemployment from rising very much from its current low level. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that it won\u2019t be too long before prices start rising more quickly than wages. Get ready for real incomes to fall and living standards to be hit. </p> <h2>Fatty fivers and the Indian Mutiny</h2> <p>Not since the Indian Mutiny of 1857 has there been as much fuss about tallow. Back then, Hindu sepoys rebelled because their rifle cartridges were greased with cow fat. This time, the Bank of England has copped it from vegans and religious groups because the new polymer \u00a35 notes contain traces of animal-derived products.</p> <p>With hindsight, Threadneedle Street probably regrets that it did not more carefully check what was used to make the fatty fivers. But more than half the \u00a35 notes in circulation are now made of polymer, and production is well under way for the next generation of \u00a310 notes in preparation for them to be issued in September.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2017/024.aspx\">The Bank has looked at whether to recall and destroy</a> all the polymer notes, but decided not to do so. That\u2019s the correct decision, because the costs of making the change \u2013 \u00a370m for pulping the notes, higher business costs, potential environmental damage from using palm or coconut oil as an alternative to tallow \u2013 are greater than the benefits.</p> <p>Public funds are not unlimited, and it would be much better value for money to get diesel cars rather than \u00a35 notes out of circulation. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has reported that sales of secondhand diesel cars rose by 11% last year, more than twice as fast as purchases of petrol models.</p> <p>The reason for that is simple: Gordon Brown as chancellor provided tax incentives for buying diesel cars as a way of tackling global warming before the health hazards became clear. Philip Hammond needs to put that right in next month\u2019s budget through a generous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/12/london-mayor-plans-to-scrap-diesels\">scrappage scheme </a>coupled with higher vehicle excise duty on diesel vehicles. Fatty fivers don\u2019t actually kill people. Diesel cars do.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A scarcity of information about disused mine sites is leaving the public in the dark on the clean-up costs from New South Wales\u2019 mining boom, a new report has found. The report, released by the Australia Institute on Wednesday, attempted to analyse what was happening to operating, suspended, closed, rehabilitated, or abandoned mine sites across the state. But it found that there were few reliable statistics available, despite the clean-up from NSW\u2019s mining boom potentially costing taxpayers billions. The NSW auditor general examined the risk posed by disused mine sites in 2011. The auditor-general\u2019s final report warned that the government\u2019s derelict mine program \u201cmay represent the largest category of contamination liability for the New South Wales government\u201d. Despite this, the Australia Institute said the NSW\u2019s division of resources and energy was only able to show one example of a mine site being successfully rehabilitated, and one site that was potentially in the final stages of closure. The report\u2019s author, Roderick Campbell, said the paucity of information had shocked him. He warned that, as the mining boom wound down, big players such as Rio Tinto, which tended to be relatively transparent and responsible, were leaving mine sites in the hands of less reputable, smaller operators, who may be unable to successfully rehabilitate the sites. \u201cThat\u2019s the risk and, in the case of NSW, what the department says is that they\u2019ve assessed the rehabilitation costs and they\u2019ve got a bond for 100% of that amount, so they\u2019re saying taxpayers are at zero per cent chance of paying,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cBut the problem is, what if they\u2019re wrong, or what if community standards change? What if the Hunter decides actually we don\u2019t want 45 large, very saline holes in the ground now? \u201cWe really are on the hook for some pretty big liabilities.\u201d The institute\u2019s report, titled Dark Side of the Boom, identified between 112 and 410 abandoned mine sites across the state, while between 85 and 109 mines remained active and 123 in suspended operations. There was no example of an open-cut mine being successfully rehabilitated, the report said, despite the likelihood of at least 45 open-cut voids across NSW. Campbell said the lack of any concrete example of open-cut rehabilitation cast doubt on the effectiveness of future clean-ups. \u201cI mean it sends a terrible message, because what the industry says is, \u2018Well, none of our big open-cut mines are ready to close,\u2019 so there\u2019s no example of it happening because we\u2019ve just kept expanding and expanding them\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you can simultaneously claim that we\u2019ve got this excellent record of rehabilitation, when they\u2019ve actually never done before what they say they\u2019re going to do 45 times.\u201d The report was largely compiled through correspondence with the NSW division of resources and energy over six months. It is one of a series of reports focussing on disused mine sites in various states and territories. A national report, released to the ABC, suggested there were 60,000 abandoned mine sites across the country. Campbell said the department had largely been well-meaning and that he did not suspect there was an active campaign not to release such data. But he said he did not believe there was any incentive for government or industry to make such information public.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A surge in fuel prices helped push inflation to its highest level for more than two years last month and economists warned of more prices pressures as the Brexit blow to the pound ramped up firms\u2019 costs. The Office for National Statistics said inflation rose to 1.8% in January from 1.6% in December and was the highest since June 2014. But it was slightly less than expected, as falling clothes prices offset some of the upward pressure on inflation from fuel and food. With inflation still below the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%, the latest figures bolstered expectations that policymakers would be in no hurry to raise interest rates. Reflecting that view, the pound dipped to below $1.25. However, economists said inflation would rise further this year, going through the Bank\u2019s target within months. Fuelling the rise is the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote, which makes imports to the UK more expensive, and also the rise in oil prices on the back of lower production. Data published alongside the inflation figures showed manufacturers\u2019 fuel and material costs were rising at the fastest pace for more than eight years. Those costs, known as input prices, jumped 20.5% year-on-year in January. Companies passed on some of their higher costs and output price inflation rose to 3.5%, the highest for five years. \u201cThe costs of raw materials and goods leaving factories both rose significantly, mainly thanks to higher oil prices and the weakened pound,\u201d said ONS head of inflation, Mike Prestwood. The ONS said the rise in headline inflation, which measures the change in price for a wide basket of goods and services, was mainly down to pricier fuel, which went up 3.4% between December and January. There was also upward pressure from food prices, which continued to fall last month but at a significantly slower pace. The figures add further to evidence that a long period of falling food prices since mid-2014 is now coming to an end. The pace of food deflation has eased off for four consecutive months. The ONS said that excluding volatile items such as food and fuel, core inflation held at 1.6% in January, lower than forecasts for it to pick up to 1.8%. Economists have warned rising inflation this year risks squeezing household incomes if wages fail to keep pace. Figures due on Wednesday are forecast to show underlying earnings growth held at 2.7% in the three months to December. But firms may be unwilling to keep raising pay as they grapple with higher costs and uncertainty about the future as Brexit negotiations unfold. Responding to news of another rise in inflation, a spokesman for the Treasury noted that earnings were still rising faster than inflation and had done so for more than two years. \u201cThe government appreciates that families are concerned about the cost of living and that is why we are cutting taxes for millions of working people and have frozen fuel duty, saving an average driver \u00a3130 a year compared to previous plans,\u201d he added. Theresa May has vowed to help what the government calls \u201cjust about managing\u201d families but a new report on Wednesday highlights the scale of that challenge after a sharp rise in the number of people living on insufficient incomes over recent years. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates the number of people living below its minimum income standard (MIS) rose from 15 million to 19 million between 2009 and 2015, equivalent to a rise from 25% to 30% of the population. The MIS is a measure of what level of income is needed for a decent living standard, as defined by the public. With prices in the shops going up, the foundation is warning that millions of just managing families are on \u201cthe tipping point of falling into poverty\u201d. \u201cThese stark figures show just how precarious life can be for many families. Government focus on people on modest incomes is welcome, but it cannot be at the expense of those at the poorest end of the income scale: it must remember just about managing today can become poverty tomorrow,\u201d said the foundation\u2019s chief executive Campbell Robb. \u201cThis could be a very difficult time for just managing families as rising inflation begins to bite into finely-balanced budgets. The high cost of living has already helped push four million more people below an adequate income, and if the cost of essentials such as food, energy and housing rise further, we need to take action to ease the strain.\u201d",

The pace of food deflation has eased off for four consecutive months.</p> <p>The ONS said that excluding volatile items such as food and fuel, core inflation held at 1.6% in January, lower than forecasts for it to pick up to 1.8%. </p> <p>Economists have warned rising inflation this year risks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/24/ifs-warnsf-biggest-squeeze-on-pay-for-70-years-autumn-statement\">squeezing household incomes</a> if wages fail to keep pace. Figures due on Wednesday are forecast to show underlying earnings growth held at 2.7% in the three months to December. But firms may be unwilling to keep raising pay as they grapple with higher costs and uncertainty about the future as Brexit negotiations unfold. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/12/the-uks-inflation-foot-soldiers-how-the-ons-measures-the-cpi\">The UK's inflation foot soldiers: how the ONS measures the CPI</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Responding to news of another rise in inflation, a spokesman for the Treasury noted that earnings were still rising faster than inflation and had done so for more than two years. </p> <p>\u201cThe government appreciates that families are concerned about the cost of living and that is why we are cutting taxes for millions of working people and have frozen fuel duty, saving an average driver \u00a3130 a year compared to previous plans,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Theresa May has vowed to help what the government calls \u201cjust about managing\u201d families but a new report on Wednesday highlights the scale of that challenge after a sharp rise in the number of people living on insufficient incomes over recent years.</p> <p>The Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates the number of people living below its <a href=\"https://www.jrf.org.uk/income-benefits/minimum-income-standards\">minimum income standard</a> (MIS) rose from 15 million to 19 million between 2009 and 2015, equivalent to a rise from 25% to 30% of the population. The MIS is a measure of what level of income is needed for a decent living standard, as defined by the public.</p> <p>With prices in the shops going up, the foundation is warning that millions of just managing families are on \u201cthe tipping point of falling into poverty\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThese stark figures show just how precarious life can be for many families. Government focus on people on modest incomes is welcome, but it cannot be at the expense of those at the poorest end of the income scale: it must remember just about managing today can become poverty tomorrow,\u201d said the foundation\u2019s chief executive Campbell Robb.</p> <p>\u201cThis could be a very difficult time for just managing families as rising inflation begins to bite into finely-balanced budgets. The high cost of living has already helped push four million more people below an adequate income, and if the cost of essentials such as food, energy and housing rise further, we need to take action to ease the strain.\u201d</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p></p>",
