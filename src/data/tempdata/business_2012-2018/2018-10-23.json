      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s Richard Partington on today\u2019s market action: Wall Street and European stock markets followed Asian shares lower on Tuesday, as investors around the world took fright at the increasingly fractious global geopolitical outlook. Investors are growing increasingly worried about a cocktail of risks that could act as a significant drag on the world economy. Potential headwinds include the trade dispute between the US and China, rising US interest rates, the fallout from the death of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the budget dispute between the EU and Italy. Oliver Jones, a markets economist at the research firm Capital Economics, said: \u201cWorries about problems in the US, and to some extent in the past few days China, have proved contagious.\u201d Goodnight! Despite that late revival, the New York stock exchange has closed in the red. But things aren\u2019t as bad as they looked earlier. The Dow has closed down 126 points, a drop of 0.5%, which means it clawed back most of its early losses. But there\u2019s still plenty of anxiety on the trading floors, following the big losses in Asia and Europe today. The EC\u2019s refusal to accept Italy\u2019s budget led to an unedifying confrontation between European commissioner Pierre Moscovici and an Italian MEP. My colleague Daniel Boffey has the details: Pierre Moscovici, the commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said the commission would hold talks with Rome with an open mind. \u201cThe opinion adopted today by the commission should come as no surprise to anyone, as the Italian government\u2019s draft budget represents a clear and intentional deviation from the commitments made by Italy last July,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, our door is not closing. We wish to continue our constructive dialogue with the Italian authorities.\u201d As Moscovici was leaving the press conference, an MEP for the League party, Angelo Ciocca, grabbed the commissioner\u2019s notes and hit them with his shoe. He later tweeted that he had slammed \u201cwith a sole made in Italy\u201d a \u201cmountain of lies\u201d. Moscovici later responded that Ciocca had no respect for his function as a parliamentarian. Here\u2019s a clip of the incident: Hello.... The US stock market is continuing to recover from its early lows. The Dow\u2019s now just 0.2% lower, or 60-odd points, having been 400+ down at the start of trading. October\u2019s turning into a most volatile month in the markets.... Mike O\u2019Rourke, chief Market strategist at JonesTrading, is also concerned by Caterpillar and 3M\u2019s earnings. He told Marketwatch: \u201cCaterpillar citing rising costs shows that the trade war is hitting home. It\u2019s industrials like Caterpillar that struggle when you\u2019re at a cyclical top.\u201d Back in New York, shares are climbing off their lowest points... but they\u2019re still in the red. The Dow is currently 273 points lower at 25,038, down 1%. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are both 1.2% lower. Caterpillar (-7%) and 3M i(-4.5%) are both dragging the Dow down, following their results and guidance. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says Caterpillar\u2019s warning of higher costs have shown the perils of America\u2019s steel tariffs and the trade war with China. These figures bring home loud and clear the ramification of the brewing trade war and come at a time when traders are starting to realise that the chances of a US \u2013 Sino trade deal being achieved are diminishing. This US \u2013 Sino trade spat is here to stay and that is frightening for the outlook of companies. Costs are increasing and fears that tighter trade conditions will slow global growth is making even the most level-headed trader nervous. When Caterpillar, a bellwether for economic activity starts to struggle, the smart money is seeing that as a signal to sell out of riskier assets. Britain\u2019s blue-chip stock index has been skittled to its lowest level since March, amid another jittery day in the markets. The FTSE 100 has closed down 87 points, or 1.25%, at 6,955, a seven-month closing low. There are losses across Europe too, as the row between the EC and Rome over its 2019 budget intensifies. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell almost 0.9%, the French CAC lost 1.7% and the DAX shipped 2.1%. Worries over the US-China trade war hurt the markets (following Caterpiller\u2019s warning of rising prices), while the Khashoggi murder also fuelled geopolitical worries. Brexit isn\u2019t exactly helping the mood either, with investor confidence weak and factory orders down (as covered this morning). Day One of the Saudi Future Investment Initiative has been roundly overshadowed by the latest developments in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. One attendee has got in touch with some observations: 1. Apparently there are 3,000 attendees. I was advised that the original number was 3,500, so it seems 500 chose not to turn up. The event is taking place in the massive convention centre alongside the Ritz Carlton. Hotel. 2. Interesting to note that the first comment at the opening was drawing focus on the Kashoggi affair. The speaker articulated the fact that the \u201cterrible event that happened\u201d is clearly \u201cnot in our Saudi DNA or the way we are. We decry what has happened and also want to thank the attendees that have come to Riyadh for the F.I.I. From abroad - your presence here is welcome and most appreciated\u201d. This overt recognition and expression of Saudi contrition and reinforcing the fact that the Saudi government is clearly distancing itself from the events in Istanbul. 3. Very strong police and security presence in place and in view across the city and a clear \u201csanitized zone\u201d established around the venue and certainly pertaining to access into and within the convention venue. 4. It seems, when looking around the vast auditorium that the majority of the audience are Saudis and people from the Middle East. Here\u2019s our latest on the situation: October has been a bad month for equities, points out Neil Wilson of Markets.com. \u201cUS equity markets turned sharply lower as investors turned chicken to the tune of some very risk-off mood music. However with earnings growth still very strong the valuations may start to look very attractive. US markets opened down around 2%, dipping to three months lows as they followed the selloff in Europe this morning which has shown no signs of abating. It of course early in the US session to make great pronouncements and these prices are moving a lot but the general tone is not good. October is turning out to be another bad one: The S&amp;P500 is on course for worst month since Sep 2011, while Nasdaq set for its worst since 2008, the Dow its shakiest since Aug 2015. The sell-off on Wall Street is accelerating. The Nasdaq is now down 2.5%, meaning it could slide into correction territory. The Dow has been lurching around too, dragged down by Caterpillar (which has tumbled by almost 10% today). Back in the US, motorbike manufacturer Harley-Davidson has reported a slump in sales to American consumers -- just months after Donald Trump pushed for a boycott. Retail sales in the United States fell 13.3% year-on-year in the last quarter, Harley said. Back in August, the US president blasted Harley for saying it would move some production overseas. Harley is being hit hard by the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed between the US and China, and the EU. This is pushing up import costs, and making motorbikes made in America less competitive. Chief Financial Officer John Olin told shareholders that the bill would run to over $40m \u201cOur expectations for the impact of recently enacted tariffs includes incremental costs of approximately $15 million to $20 million for steel and aluminum and approximately $25 million for EU tariffs. Additionally, China increased its tariffs volume on foreign motorcycles produced in the United States by 25 percentage points and the U.S. has increased tariffs on certain products imported from China. We believe this will increase our 2018 cost by approximately $3 million. In total we now expect to incur approximately $43 million to $48 million of increased costs related to the tariffs during 2018.\u201d The Italian government has hit back, warning that it will not change its 2019 budget despite the EC\u2019s demand for a rewrite. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte has told Bloomberg that his government could tweak its fiscal plans, but not aim for a smaller deficit. Conte said he \u201ccannot accept\u201d dropping some of Italy\u2019s spending plans, warning that. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any B plan. I said that the deficit at 2.4 percent of GDP is the cap. I can say this will be our cap.\u201d Italy is planning to boost its spending next year to meet the election pledges made by its two coalition partners, the far-right anti-immigrants League party, and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Promises such as tax cuts, a universal basic income and pension reforms will cost around \u20ac17bn (\u00a315bn). That creates a larger structural deficit, which is the EC\u2019s concern, but Rome argues it will also spur growth. If Italy doesn\u2019t revise its budget, then the EC could launch an \u201cExcessive Deficit Procedure\u201d against it. That could result in a large fine, and closer scrutiny of Italy\u2019s tax and spending plans. That could also worsen relations between the two sides, potentially alarming the markets or fuelling eurosceptic feelings. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici hopes that a compromise can be found.... This is why the EC has a problem with Italy\u2019s new tax and spending plans: Newsflash: The European Commission has rejected Italy\u2019s 2019 budget, and demanded a rewrite. As many analysts had predicted, Brussels has concluded that the Italian tax and spending plans breach EU guidelines. It is now giving Rome three weeks to submit a revised plan, with a smaller deficit for next year. This is the first time the Commission has rejected a member state\u2019s budget, since being given the power during the eurozone crisis. Commission Vice President for the Euro Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters in Brussels that: \u201cToday, for the first time, the Commission is obliged to request a euro area country to revise its draft budget plan,\u201d \u201cBut we see no alternative than to request the Italian government to do so. We have adopted an opinion giving Italy a maximum of three weeks to provide a revised Draft Budgetary Plan for 2019. Dombrovskis added that the \u201cclarifications\u201d submitted by Italy yesterday had not addressed the EC\u2019s concerns, adding: \u201cThe Italian Government is openly and consciously going against the commitments it made. Boom! Global stock markets have slumped to their lowest level in over a year. Today\u2019s losses in America, Europe and Asia have dragged the MSCI All-Country World Index to levels last seen in September 2017. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says Caterpillar\u2019s results have added to the swirling cocktail of risks pulling shares down today. Caterpillar\u2019s third quarter earnings beat forecasts with progress across most end markets. But the tone of the report made clear earnings momentum was not the main story in the quarter. The impression was compounded by 2018 earnings forecasts remaining untouched, for the first time since two straight quarterly upgrades. Technology companies and banks are leading today\u2019s sell-off in New York, as October continues to prove a volatile month. Ouch! The New York stock exchange has opened sharply lower. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 430 points at the start of trading, a drop of 1.7%. That took the index back down to around 24,890 points -- around 2,000 points less than three weeks ago. It\u2019s a grotty picture; Caterpillar has tanked by over 7%, after warning shareholders today that price pressures are rising, as tariffs take a bite out of profits. The S&amp;P 500 has dropped to its lowest level since July. Here\u2019s our news story about the drop in UK factory orders: And here\u2019s some cheerier news, as the Harry Potter phenomenon continues to boost Bloomsbury: A reminder of the big sell-off in Asia overnight: European stock markets are still deep in the red, as traders grimace and anticipate the start of trading in New York. In London, the FTSE 100 is now down 77 points at 6965, a drop of 1.1%, which would be its lowest closing point in seven months. This won\u2019t help investor confidence to claw its way back from the lows reported earlier. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 is still languishing at a 22-month low, with Germany down 1.8% and Italy losing 1.1%. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, blames renewed anxiety over China - which triggered the selloff in Asia overnight. Hopes that we may see a Chinese-led recovery have been dashed for the time being. After a strong two-day rally, Chinese stocks fell back sharply overnight [-2.2%]. As a result, the losses for European indices sharply increased at the open this morning while US index futures also fell across the board. Chinese equities, which had been hit the hardest this year, rebounded at the end of last week and start of this in part because of the Chinese government promising to provide more stimulus to stabilize its economy and offset the impact of US tariffs hurting its exports. In addition, there was some speculation that the US and China were going to put aside their trade spat and come to an agreement of some sort at the G20 meeting in Argentina next month, where US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were likely to meet. However, those hopes were dashed when White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow accused China of doing \u201cnothing\u201d to defuse the trade tensions. Marketwatch says Caterpillar\u2019s prediction of further rising prices (partly thanks to tariffs) has spooked investors: Though Caterpillar narrowly beat expectations for profit and warnings in the quarter, the outlook for more rising costs spooked investors. Caterpillar\u2019s shares fell 5.9% in premarket trading on Tuesday. Caterpillar said it would raise prices 1% to 4% world-wide next year on most machines and engines to offset some of the higher costs. Other manufacturers have also said they are passing on higher costs by raising prices. Defence group Lockheed Martin may have bucked the gloom, by posting strong results and hiking its sales forecast for the rest of the year. Increased demand for its F-35 fighter plane helped to drive Lockheed\u2019s net sales up to $14.3bn in the last quarter, up from $12.3bn a year earlier. Earnings per share jumped to $5.14, up from $3.32 12 months ago. Lockheed Martin chairman, president and chief executive Marillyn Hewson says: Our team achieved another quarter of strong growth leading us to improve our expectations for our full-year financial results.\u201d Hold onto your hats! The Dow is now expected to tumble by 400 points, or more than 1.5%, at the open - partly due to those results from Caterpillar and 3M. In another blow, US conglomerate 3M has also posted underwhelming results. The group\u2019s industrial sales were flat in the last quarter, while healthcare sales fell 2.8%, consumer sales fell 3.4% and electronics and energy dropped by 4.8%. However, total sales grew 7.0 percent in Safety and Graphics. 3M also trimmed its earnings outlook for 2018. Shares have slumped by over 7%. Caterpillar\u2019s results also show that consumers are paying the price of Donald Trump\u2019s trade disputes: NEWSFLASH: Caterpillar, the construction equipment giant, has just reported results -- and Wall Street isn\u2019t happy. Caterpillar has warned that it is facing \u201csupply chain challenges across the industry\u201d. Raw material costs have also jumped, it warns, partly due to increased steel prices and other tariffs introduced since Donald Trump was elected. It says: Manufacturing costs were higher due to increased material and freight costs. Material costs were higher primarily due to increases in steel prices and tariffs. Freight costs were unfavorable primarily due to supply chain inefficiencies as the industry continues to respond to strong global demand. Caterpillar says that recently imposed tariffs cost it around $40m in the last quarter, a concrete sign that the trade war is hurting US companies. On the upside, Caterpillar narrowly beat profit expectations in the last three months. It made $2.88 per share, ahead of forecasts of $2.72, while revenues jumped by 18% year-on-year to $13.5bn. Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby says: \u201cThis was the best third-quarter profit per share in our company\u2019s history. Our global team continues to do excellent work focusing on our customers\u2019 success and executing our strategy for profitable growth.\u201d Shares have fallen by over 6% in pre-market trading. In further gloomy news, UK manufacturers have reported the sharp fall in orders since the EU referendum. The CBI, which represents Britain\u2019s bosses, reports that new orders at UK factories fell at the fastest pace in three years in the last quarter. Firms are also more pessimistic about business prospect, particularly about their chances of selling goods abroad. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, says: \u201cThis is a sobering set of figures demanding immediate action at home and abroad. \u201cPlanned investment is being scaled back in the face of deepening Brexit uncertainty, so it\u2019s vital that the Chancellor incentivises manufacturers to spend in areas that will help them become more productive. Using the upcoming Budget to increase the Annual Investment Allowance, alongside a wider review, could help the UK become more competitive with its global peers. Here\u2019s more details from the CBI\u2019s industrial trends report: 10% of firms said they were more optimistic about the general business situation than three months ago and 25% were less optimistic, giving a rounded balance of -16%, the fastest decline since July 2016. Optimism about export prospects for the year ahead deteriorated at the fastest pace since 2012 (-15% down from -2% in July). 27% of firms said the volume of output over the past three months was up and 14% said it was down, giving a balance of +13%, up from +11% in the quarter to September. 21% of businesses reported an increase in new orders, and 28% reported a decrease, giving a rounded balance of -6%, the weakest balance since October 2015. Domestic orders (-10%) and export orders both fell (-8%), a weaker reading than in the previous quarter (+8% and +21% respectively). No wonder the FTSE 100 is falling. UK investor morale has hit its lowest level in at least 23 years, according to financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown. Its Investor Confidence Index has fallen to 53 this month, from 58 in October - its lowest level since it began in 1993. It has averaged 92 over the last decade, but just 69 over the last 12 months. Brexit is the top issue worrying investors, while wider global instability is another concern pushing the index down: If this index is right, it means the City is more downbeat than during the 2008 financial crisis. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the constant drip-feed of Brexit news has drenched investors in gloom: \u2018Investors are in grim mood, as time is running out on Brexit negotiations with little progress on show. Sentiment was dented by the financial crisis, but not to the extent we are seeing today. That\u2019s perhaps because the crisis unfolded in an unscheduled fashion, while the timeline on the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU is there for all to see. A looming early Budget and a stormy October on the markets will do little to settle nerves. These are challenging times for investors who are faced with a significant known unknown in the form of Brexit. In such circumstances, it\u2019s worth falling back on the basics of investing. That means taking a long term perspective, keeping diversified, and drip feeding money into the markets to take advantage of any dips.\u2019 Over in Ankara, Turkey\u2019s president has told its parliament that the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was a premeditated and meticulously planned political assassination. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan vowed to pursue the investigation into Khashoggi\u2019s death, calling on Riyadh to hand over those responsible. Here\u2019s a link to our liveblog. Importantly, Erdo\u011fan appeared to absolve the Saudi leader while not mentioning crown prince Mohammad Bin Salman, saying: \u201cI do not doubt the sincerity of King Salman. That being said, independent investigation needs to be carried out. This is a political killing\u201d But Erdo\u011fan did not release any significant new details about the killing. So the Saudi stock market has shaken off its early slump, and is now up on the day. Here are the best and worst performers on the FTSE 100 today, as the index wallows at a seven-month low. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has slid to a new seven-month low, as world stock markets extend today\u2019s losses. The Footsie is now down 82 points at 6,959, its lowest level since the end of March this year. The smaller FTSE 250, which contains medium-sized companies, has slumped by 1.8% or 350 points.. The slump is being led by technology stocks, miners, energy firms and industrial companies. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx blames a \u201cpoisonous brewing cauldron of geopolitical and economic issues\u201d [which sounds even scarier than this morning\u2019s \u2018thick blanket of risk\u2019] Ingredients bobbing in the cauldron include.... The unresolved US-China trade war (and fears about the latter\u2019s economy), the US withdrawal from the INF Treaty, the Khasohoggi-related friction between the West and Saudi Arabia, Brexit (all of it, but specifically the rising chances of a no deal divorce), and, perhaps most pertinent to Tuesday, the ongoing EU-Italy budget dispute. A calamitous cavalcade of market concerns, of such seriousness that it is a surprise the global indices ever manage to edge into the green. The futures market is indicating a bad start on Wall Street later today. The Dow is now expected to drop by over 1%. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s technology company Dyson has decided to build its first electric car in Singapore. The company has chosen Singapore over the UK, as it prepares to get the vehicle on the road in 2021. The electric car is being designed and tested at Hullavington Airfield in Wiltshire, in western England, but will be manufactured almost 7,000 miles away. Dyson says it chose Singapore due to the \u201cinternational nature\u201d of its operations. It already employs around 1,100 people in Singapore, where it makes electric motors. Jim Rowan, CEO of Dyson says: Our existing footprint and team in Singapore, combined with the nation\u2019s significant advanced manufacturing expertise, made it a frontrunner. Singapore also offers access to high-growth markets as well as an extensive supply chain and a highly skilled workforce. Singapore has a comparatively high cost base, but also great technology expertise and focus. It is therefore the right place to make high quality technology loaded machines, and the right place to make our electric vehicle. Fifteen years ago, Dyson was criticised for moving washing machines production from Wiltshire to Malaysia. Today\u2019s decision feels like another blow to UK manufacturing. Dyson, though, points out that its total UK headcount has increased by 2.5 times over the last five years to 4,800. It is currently spending \u00a3200m on new buildings and testing facilities at Hullavington. In a letter to staff, Rowan says: Dyson is truly global in its development, delivery and realisation of technology. This decision is good news for the exceptional teams we have in both the UK and Singapore. Saudi Arabia still expects to sign tens of billions of dollar of deals at its investment conference, despite those high-profile withdrawals following Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s death. Reuters explains: Saudi Arabia brushed off an outcry over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and went ahead on Tuesday with an investment conference boycotted by Western political figures, leading international bankers and company executives. Speaking at the opening session, prominent Saudi businesswoman Lubna Olayan said the killing of the Washington Post columnist was \u201calien to our culture\u201d and voiced confidence that the kingdom will \u201cemerge stronger\u201d. Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, is expected to sign deals worth more than $50 billion in the oil, gas, industries and infrastructure sectors on the opening day with companies including Trafigura, Total, Hyundai, Norinco, Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes. Hundreds of bankers and company executives joined officials at a palatial Riyadh hotel for the Future Investment Initiative, an annual event designed to help attract billions of dollars of foreign capital as part of reforms to end Saudi dependence on oil exports. We\u2019re live-blogging president Erdo\u011fan\u2019s speech on Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s death, here: WSJ reporter Rory Jones says the Saudi investment conference is underway - despite scores of big names pulling out. My colleague Rob Davies points out that a string of big names have resisted the chance to mix with crown prince MbS: The high-profile pull-outs from the FII include JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon, the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, Glencore chairman Tony Hayward and many more \u2013 even Uber\u2019s boss, Dara Khosrowshahi, despite the PIF\u2019s $3.5bn investment in his company. Separately, Richard Branson has suspended the Gulf state\u2019s $1bn investment in his space project, Virgin Galactic. Rarely have so many business leaders been seen running in the same direction, in this case away from Saudi Arabia at speed. All of this deals considerable damage to the public profile of a man who was meant to be the standard-bearer for reform and modernisation. When MBS was in California on his tour, he hired out most of the Four Seasons hotel in Beverly Hills, enjoying lunches with Rupert Murdoch, rubbing shoulders in Silicon Valley with the likes of Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and schmoozing film stars. Plenty of other executives have shown up, though: In another blow to Saudi Arabia, Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son has abandoned plans to speak at its Future Investment Initiative (FII), which started today. Michael Amon of the Wall Street Journal reports that Son may still be present, but he won\u2019t be on the stage. Saudi Arabia\u2019s stock market has also dropped in early trading, down 1.2%. Traders will be worrying about Riyadh growing isolation following Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder, and the prospect of Turkey releasing the \u201cnaked truth\u201d about the killing later today. Yesterday Donald Trump said he wasn\u2019t happy with the response from Saudi Arabia, telling reporters: \u201cI am not satisfied with what I\u2019ve heard. We\u2019re going to get to the bottom of it.\u201d Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin, has cancelled his appearance at Saudi Arabia\u2019s investment conference - but he did met with crown prince Mohammed bin Salman yesterday. MBS - who had billed himself as a social and economic reformer - had built close ties with Washington, particularly with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Now, though, he facing intense pressure over the Khashoggi case, with many analysts concluding that he authorised the killing. Several of his close aides have been arrested or dismissed. Mnuchin\u2019s spokesman, Tony Sayegh, has tweeted about the meeting: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets points out that the US stock market fell yesterday, helping to trigger today\u2019s losses in Asia and now Europe. The negative opens come after Asia\u2019s rally cooled, retracing Monday\u2019s jump amid fresh fears about global trade, geopolitical tensions and the US midterm elections. Wall Street added to downbeat sentiment with banks and financials leading the slide as worries mount over the strength of earnings from the remainder of corporates set to report. Boom! As feared, European stock markets have slumped to their lowest point in almost two years. Germany\u2019s DAX dropped 1.35% in early trading, France\u2019s CAC and Spain\u2019s IBEX both lost 1%, and Italy has shed 0.8%. This has hauled the Euro Stoxx 600 index down to its lowest point since December 2016. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets fears it will be a tough day, possibly dominated by worries about Italy. Geopolitical tensions, Italian budget woes and the ongoing standoff between the European Commission and Italy are making investors nervous. Given that there is no solution about the trade war between the US and China stand is making things a bit more arduous today. We need to have a solution to the Italian budget. Investors are going to keep a close eye on the European Commission\u2019s decision today about the Italian budget. The commission may end up doing something which is unprecedented- it may ask Italy to revise and resubmit its budget. It is widely expected that the commission is going to have a negative opinion about the budget, but the question is if Italy will be ready to comply with the request? The Italian banking sector could be the primary trade here because if the Italian bond spread touched the 400 basis points, it is going to create a lot of trouble for the sector. The bond spread has already touched a five-year high of 341 basis points on Friday. Ouch. Britain\u2019s blue-chip stock index has fallen close to an eight-month low at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 is down 51 points, or 0.8%, at 6991, close to its lowest level since April Today\u2019s selloff has pushed stocks across Asia to the brink of a bear market (more than 20 percent off their recent highs. MSCI Asia Pacific Index has dropped to its lowest since May 2017, with losses across the region. Bloomberg has the details: Among the steepest decreases were in Japan, Hong Kong and China, where shares had had the biggest jump in more than two years Monday. Global equities as measured by the MSCI World Index face their worst month since August 2015. S&amp;P 500 Index futures declined 1% and Euro Stoxx 50 contracts opened more than 1% lower, indicating the rout will spread to U.S. and European markets. The yen gained and gold ticked higher. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Pessimism is gripping the global markets this morning, as investors fret about a clutch of economic and geopolitical issues. The budget row between Italy and the EU, Brexit, the brutal killing of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi, and America\u2019s withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces nuclear treaty with Russia are all creating angst on the trading floors today. The lack of progress in the US-China trade dispute isn\u2019t helping either. Asian markets have already been hit, with Japan\u2019s Topix index sliding by 2.6% and Hong Kong losing 3%. China, which surged by over 4% yesterday on hopes of a government stimulus, has handed back half those gains today. Markets remain shrouded in \u201ca thick blanket of risk today\u201d as investors fear shares could take a tumble, says Stephen Innes, head of Asia-Pacific trading for foreign exchange firm OANDA. The US dollar outperformed on Monday on the back of Italy and Brexit risk while the mere utterance of a protracted equity correction remains a highly sensitive topic that investors fear could morph from a wall of worry into a towering wall of pain. Risk aversion continues to permeate every pocket of the markets whether triggered by President Trump\u2019s latest tweets on immigration or the blustery headwinds from Riyadh to Rome; markets remain shrouded in a thick blanket of risk. European market are expected to take a jolt when trading begins shortly. Traders will be watching to see if Brussels orders Rome to rewrite its 2019 budget, which currently contains a deficit target of 2.4% of GDP. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is due to release more details about Khashoggi\u2019s death in the Saudi consulate at Istanbul, in a speech later today. With international condemnation mounting, Saudi have now called the killing a \u201ctremendous mistake\u201d and launched an investigation. Riyadh is also pushing on with a major investment summit, starting today, but many business leaders have already pulled out. IG predict that the FTSE 100 will drop close to a seven-month low, while European markets could hit levels last seen in late 2016.

      "bodyText": "Stock market investors\u2019 ability to ignore big geopolitical events is legendary. Give them a whiff of lower interest rates and most big-picture troubles can be relegated to the status of passing worries. In the absence of cheaper money, however, the story can be different. Tuesday\u2019s early declines, which were really a continuation of a losing run that has lasted for most of October, marked a moment when investors were obliged to acknowledge that, yes, some global forces look genuinely alarming. First, the trade war between China and the US is having an impact that US companies can count. Caterpillar, the manufacturer of earth-moving equipment, said the full-year whack from higher steel and aluminium prices will be about $100m (\u00a377m). The company did not seek to argue that President Donald Trump has saved a few US steel mills at the cost of imposing higher prices on major American companies who employ far more people. But that\u2019s how many economists see things. Tariffs have consequences. Second, the trade war may eventually hit harder in China. There is little evidence it is happening yet \u2013 the latest export figures were strong \u2013 but overall growth has slowed to the weakest rate since the financial crisis. Cuts in personal taxation \u2013 Beijing\u2019s attempt to generate growth \u2013 strike many as inadequate. The policy is better than yet more mega-spending on under-used infrastructure, a game that creates long-term problems but the short-term boost to the economy may be hard to spot. External confidence, like the renminbi, is falling. Third, the showdown between Italy and the European commission is unprecedented. Brussels has rejected the draft budget proposed by the populist administration in Rome on the grounds that it breaches budgetary rules. Penalties are supposed to follow if Rome refuses to spend less or tax more. There is no easy way out of the fix. Fourth, the crisis in Saudi Arabia provoked by the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi could take almost any direction. Diplomatic isolation and higher oil prices are clearly possibilities. In the short-term, the flow of funding from Riyadh to the US technology sector looks to be over: it is hard to see how any self-respecting company could accept the cash. Investors\u2019 overall mood might improve if the US Federal Reserve sounded less keen on more rises in interest rates. But that, if it happens, is next year\u2019s story. For the time being, the Fed can see inflationary pressures in the system and has set its course. The stock market will find its level but the steady selloff of recent weeks looks entirely rational. Intu puts a positive spin on rental woes As an exercise in accentuating the positive, it would be hard to beat the trading update from Intu, the shopping centre group that owns Lakeside in Essex, Merry Hill in Dudley and the Metrocentre in Gateshead. You\u2019d almost believe the company owns only idyllic oases within an otherwise barren retailing landscape. Intu\u2019s operational performance was \u201cstrong and resilient\u201d, reported its chief executive, David Fischel, \u201cdemonstrating the clear differentiation between winning destinations such as Intu owns and the rest\u201d. Eighty-four new leases were signed at higher rents. Occupancy across the portfolio stands at a mighty 97%. Jolly good, so these centres must be rising in value, right? Surely even dim-witted valuers can appreciate Intu\u2019s ability to live with the rise of internet shopping? Unfortunately not. Intu\u2019s net asset value fell 3% in three months. The valuation, said Fischel cheerfully \u201creflects current negative investor sentiment towards UK retail property\u201d but, hey, Intu is confident it can \u201cweather the challenges\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Stock market investors\u2019 ability to ignore big geopolitical events is legendary. Give them a whiff of lower interest rates and most big-picture troubles can be relegated to the status of passing worries. In the absence of cheaper money, however, the story can be different. Tuesday\u2019s early declines, which were really a continuation of a losing run that has lasted for most of October, marked a moment when investors were obliged to acknowledge that, yes, some global forces look genuinely alarming.</p> <p>First, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/17/donald-trump-united-states-threatens-to-impose-200bn-import-tariffs-on-china-in-trade-war\">the trade war between China and the US</a> is having an impact that US companies can count. Caterpillar, the manufacturer of earth-moving equipment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/23/caterpillar-shares-fall-after-disappointing-earnings-forecast\">said the full-year whack from higher steel and aluminium prices will be a</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/23/caterpillar-shares-fall-after-disappointing-earnings-forecast\">bout $100m</a> (\u00a377m).</p> <p>The company did not seek to argue that President Donald Trump has saved a few US steel mills at the cost of imposing higher prices on major American companies who employ far more people. But that\u2019s how many economists see things. Tariffs have consequences.</p> <p>Second, the trade war may eventually hit harder in China. There is little evidence it is happening yet \u2013 the latest export figures were strong \u2013 but overall growth has slowed to the weakest rate since the financial crisis. Cuts in personal taxation \u2013 Beijing\u2019s attempt to generate growth \u2013 strike many as inadequate. The policy is better than yet more mega-spending on under-used infrastructure, a game that creates long-term problems but the short-term boost to the economy may be hard to spot. External confidence, like the renminbi, is falling.</p> <p>Third, the showdown between Italy and the European commission is unprecedented. Brussels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/23/eu-and-italy-face-off-over-populist-governments-budget\">has rejected the draft budget</a> proposed by the populist administration in Rome on the grounds that it breaches budgetary rules. Penalties are supposed to follow if Rome refuses to spend less or tax more. There is no easy way out of the fix.</p> <p>Fourth, the crisis in Saudi Arabia provoked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/23/turkish-president-erdogan-rejects-saudi-account-of-khashoggi-killing\">the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a> could take almost any direction. Diplomatic isolation and higher oil prices are clearly possibilities. In the short-term, the flow of funding from Riyadh to the US technology sector looks to be over: it is hard to see how any self-respecting company could accept the cash.</p> <p>Investors\u2019 overall mood might improve if the US Federal Reserve sounded less keen on more rises in interest rates. But that, if it happens, is next year\u2019s story. For the time being, the Fed can see inflationary pressures in the system and has set its course. The stock market will find its level but the steady selloff of recent weeks looks entirely rational.</p> <h2>Intu puts a positive spin on rental woes</h2> <p>As an exercise in accentuating the positive, it would be hard to beat the trading update from Intu, the shopping centre group that owns Lakeside in Essex, Merry Hill in Dudley and the Metrocentre in Gateshead. You\u2019d almost believe the company owns only idyllic oases within an otherwise barren retailing landscape.</p> <p>Intu\u2019s operational performance was \u201cstrong and resilient\u201d, reported its chief executive, David Fischel, \u201cdemonstrating the clear differentiation between winning destinations such as Intu owns and the rest\u201d. Eighty-four new leases were signed at higher rents. Occupancy across the portfolio stands at a mighty 97%.</p> <p>Jolly good, so these centres must be rising in value, right? Surely even dim-witted valuers can appreciate Intu\u2019s ability to live with the rise of internet shopping? Unfortunately not. Intu\u2019s net asset value fell 3% in three months. The valuation, said Fischel cheerfully \u201creflects current negative investor sentiment towards UK retail property\u201d but, hey, Intu is confident it can \u201cweather the challenges\u201d.</p> <p>If he is really so confident, there\u2019s one way to show it. The board could declare that all takeover offers below Intu\u2019s asset value \u2013 344p or 297p, depending on which valuation method one prefers \u2013 will be rejected. So the message to the consortium led by John Whittaker\u2019s Peel Group, which has pitched 215p, or \u00a32.9bn, would be: \u201cSorry but you\u2019re not even roughly in the right ballpark.\u201d</p> <p>In the real world, that\u2019s unlikely to happen. If Peel Group, which already owns 27% of Intu, improves its offer, it will be a heavy favourite to succeed.

      "bodyText": "The European commission is at loggerheads with Rome after taking the unprecedented step of rejecting the Italian government\u2019s draft budget in a move designed to force the country\u2019s populist government to rein in its spending. Italy was presented with a three-week deadline to provide a revised financial plan, and the commission\u2019s vice-president, Valdis Dombrovskis, noted that Italy already spent more servicing debt than it did on education. The commissioner, a former prime minister of Latvia, threatened to begin a procedure that could lead to the EU imposing fines on Italy unless the new government reconsiders. Dombrovskis accused Rome of \u201copenly and consciously going against commitments made\u201d. \u201cToday, for the first time, the commission is obliged to request a euro area country to revise its draft budgetary plan,\u201d Dombrovskis said. \u201cBut we see no alternative \u2026 Breaking rules can be tempting on a first look. It can provide the illusion of breaking free. It can be tempting to try to cure debt with more debt. But, at some point, the debt weights too heavy and you end up having no freedom at all.\u201d Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, was unrepentant. \u201cWe won\u2019t subtract one single euro from the budget,\u201d he told reporters during a visit to Bucharest. \u201cI personally am available to go even tomorrow to meet the president of the European commission to explain how Italy\u2019s economy will grow thanks to this manoeuvre. But no one will take one euro from this budget.\u201d The Italian government, led by the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and made up of a coalition of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the far-right League, says it needs \u20ac17bn (\u00a315bn) to fund election campaign promises, including tax cuts, a universal basic income and pension changes. The reaction of the markets to the commission\u2019s announcement was instant, with the cost of borrowing on international bond markets rising and the Milan stock market falling by 1%. Italy\u2019s public debt is worth more than 130% of the country\u2019s GDP, the second-highest level in the EU after Greece and more than double the bloc\u2019s limit of 60%. Italy was allocated \u20ac44.7bn between 2014 and 2020 as part of the EU\u2019s stability and growth pact to support the competitiveness of its small and medium businesses, on the proviso that it lived up to fiscal commitments designed to avoid a repeat of the 2007 financial crash. The new government\u2019s proposed budget, however, aims to have a deficit of 2.4% of GDP in 2019, more than three times what it had previously promised. Dombrovskis said the level of Italy\u2019s debt amounted to \u20ac37,000 per inhabitant and that the proposed budget would mean first-time home owners were faced with impossible interest rates on their loans and Italian companies unable to access funds for growth. \u201cThe ball is now in the court of the Italian government,\u201d he said. Pierre Moscovici, the commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said the commission would hold talks with Rome with an open mind. \u201cThe opinion adopted today by the commission should come as no surprise to anyone, as the Italian government\u2019s draft budget represents a clear and intentional deviation from the commitments made by Italy last July,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, our door is not closing. We wish to continue our constructive dialogue with the Italian authorities.\u201d As Moscovici was leaving the press conference, an MEP for the League party, Angelo Ciocca, grabbed the commissioner\u2019s notes and hit them with his shoe. He later tweeted that he had slammed \u201cwith a sole made in Italy\u201d a \u201cmountain of lies\u201d. Moscovici later responded that Ciocca had no respect for his function as a parliamentarian.",

    "webTitle": "Government's rogue landlord list empty after six months", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s new rogue landlord database was billed as a key tool for local councils to target the country\u2019s worst landlords, but, more than six months after the system started, not a single name has been added \u2013 and even when some are added, the public will not be able to find out. A freedom of information request filed by the Guardian and ITV News revealed that by the end of August the database was empty. When details of rogue landlords are eventually entered they will only be accessible to central and local government, unless the rules are changed. When the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) was asked via another freedom of information request to spell out why the public would be denied access to the database, it said the reasons behind keeping the database\u2019s contents secret were also secret. The department added: \u201cIt is not in the public interest to disclose this information at this time.\u201d When a third request was made to ask whether any names had been added in September and October, the MHCLG again refused to answer, saying yet another FoI request would be necessary, with the usual 20 days for them to provide a response. The Guardian and ITV News has since confirmed independently that the database remains empty. The chief executive of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, David Cox, added: \u201cThis is a truly ridiculous piece of legislation. There are no legal reasons for this database being kept secret. How on earth is a tenant supposed to know if a landlord has been banned? Also, professional bodies like ours may inadvertently endorse a banned landlord or letting agent by accepting them as a member.\u201d The secrecy and sparsity of the central government database contrasts sharply with a separate rogue landlord database run by the mayor of London\u2019s office. The London version allows the public to view prosecutions of rogue landlords in the capital\u2019s boroughs for a year after the conviction date. The MHCLG hinted that its secret database could remain empty of named rogue landlords for months. An MHCLG spokesperson said: \u201cOnly offences committed from April this year can be included and it can take a number of months to secure convictions. We expect to see entries in the database increasing in the new year.\u201d They added: \u201cCouncils have welcomed the database as an important tool to help them crack down on the minority of landlords who rent out unsafe and substandard accommodation.\u201d Since April, councils in England have been compelled to use the database to enter the details of rogue landlords who receive one of the government\u2019s new banning orders, which local authorities can apply to the courts to be issued to the sector\u2019s worst offenders and prevents a landlord letting their property either themselves or by using an agent. Local authorities can also choose to use the new database to enter the details of landlords who have been convicted of a \u201cbanning order offence\u201d \u2013 a range of 14 offences from unlawful eviction and harassment to licensing breaches \u2013 or who have received two financial penalties for housing offences in the past year. Banning orders, which compel a local authority to make an entry on to the system, can only be handed to landlords for offences committed after 6 April 2018. Discretionary entries into the database also only apply to offences committed since that date. Richard Tacagni, managing director of the consultancy London Property Licensing, said the database would have only a limited impact because not all offences had to be listed. \u201cThere is no duty on councils to add landlords who have been convicted of a relevant offence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only requirement is to list banning orders, which will be few and far between. Unless councils actively populate the database following housing prosecutions, it will have very little impact in identifying repeat offenders.\u201d Alex Schembri, co-founder of property technology company GetRentr, also criticised the decision to restrict access to the new government system, and said it would have less impact than the mayor of London\u2019s register. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that it is closed off from the public. It\u2019s a missed opportunity and we would hope this policy changes in the future. \u201cIn contrast, the mayor of London\u2019s database \u2026 is a priceless tool for those of us who are trying to improve the private rental sector \u2026 Simply hiding everything does a huge disservice to those working to prosecute rogue landlords and agents.\u201d The MHCLG added that it was \u201cexploring further options for making information contained with the database available to prospective and existing tenants\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The legislation designed to catch rogue landlords is vast and very complex. Landlords can be prosecuted under various pieces of law, including the Housing Act (2004), the Protection from Eviction Act (1977), the Health and Safety at Work Act (1974) and Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order (2005). All of that legislation creates a confusing landscape. It can be difficult to work out how it all fits together, and even within individual acts there are loopholes. For example, the licensing of landlords was introduced as part of the 2004 Housing Act, which came into force in 2006 and was billed as a method of addressing poor management of properties, antisocial behaviour and the need for fire safety. Under that legislation landlords must be considered \u201cfit and proper\u201d to be issued with a licence. In order to decide whether a landlord is fit and proper, the legislation states that \u201cthe local housing authority must have regard (among other things) to \u2026 [whether the landlord has] contravened any provision of the law relating to housing or of landlord and tenant law\u201d. If a landlord is found renting out a property that requires a licence without one, they can be prosecuted. Many of the successful prosecutions against landlords are for licensing offences. Licensing is controversial among landlords, even if it seems to be a sensible way of attempting to reduce criminality in the sector. Plenty of them are in favour of the idea, but the schemes are often criticised as expensive, bureaucratic and confusing, and even supporters identify problems. Until 2013, licensing typically applied to landlords renting out houses in multiple occupation (HMO). An HMO is a property shared by at least three people who are not from a single household, but share facilities such as a toilet and kitchen. In England and Wales, a \u201clarge HMO\u201d \u2013 with at least five people from more than one household who share facilities \u2013must be licensed. Selective schemes under which local authorities can require a license for other rental properties were introduced from 2013. In 2015, the London borough of Newham introduced the first borough-wide scheme, which essentially meant that all of its private landlords needed a licence, no matter what type of property they were renting out. Since 2015, a council has been required to gain central government approval in order to run a selective scheme extending across more than 20% of the borough. When others followed Newham\u2019s lead in implementing wide-ranging selective schemes, they found it tricky to get approval. There are currently 44 local authorities in England and Wales with selective licensing schemes running. Of those, just four cover the whole of the borough in which they are enacted, according to the property technology company GetRentr. Even Newham\u2019s scheme, which the secretary of state freshly approved at the start of this year, no longer covers the whole borough. The patchy nature of the regime also extends to the sanctions available to local authorities. Punishments \u2013 such as the removal of a landlord\u2019s \u201cfit and proper\u201d status \u2013 only apply to the local authority area where a landlord breached the law. Other councils can take a failure into account, assuming they know about it. So a landlord found not to be fit and proper in one borough can be deemed fit and proper a few hundred metres down the road by a neighbouring local authority. Dr Stephen Battersby, a housing consultant who is a visiting senior fellow at the Robens Centre for Public and Environmental Health at the University of Surrey, said: \u201cIt is bizarre that someone who is not fit and proper in one borough can be deemed fit and proper in another.\u201d The licensing regime, he said, also allowed someone who was ruled not fit and proper, but who owned a property, to have it managed by another person. \u201cThis is clearly a loophole that can be exploited,\u201d he said. Failing a fit and proper person test does not mean that all or any of the landlord\u2019s properties are unfit. Landlords can even find loopholes to carry on within the local authority area where they were found to be unfit. Take Newham, which says it has \u201cbanned\u201d 28 landlords. Under the latest iteration of its selective licensing scheme, landlords do not need a licence to rent out property in the borough\u2019s Olympic Park. So there is nothing stopping Newham\u2019s 28 \u201cbanned\u201d landlords from buying housing in that area and renting it out. Martin Tett, housing spokesman at the Local Government Association, said: \u201cLegislation is not keeping pace with the ingenuity of these rogue landlords, and whilst councils are determined to do everything in their power to ensure tenants can live in secure properties, it\u2019s essential that legislation is more cohesive, and prevents the minority of rogue landlords from taking advantage of those at the sharp end of our housing crisis. \u201cMany councils are already tackling issues in the private rental sector by bringing in landlord licensing schemes, but they are limited in how widely these can be introduced. We need to see these rules relaxed and councils given more freedom and flexibility in establishing schemes.\u201d From April this year, councils in England have also been granted additional powers to issue banning orders under the 2016 Housing and Planning Act, which supplements the 2004 legislation. However, not a single banning order has so far been made. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government says it is too soon for councils to have gone through the necessary processes to have made a banning order.",

      "bodyText": "Gary Fixter: urged by a judge to \u2018give up being a landlord\u2019 Gary Fixter has a record of persistently operating as a rogue landlord. Between 2016 and 2018 he failed to act on repeated warnings to improve the standard of his properties, despite collecting \u00a3100,000 a year in rent and earning a salary of \u00a394,000 a year as an IT consultant. He amassed eight convictions for renting out substandard shared houses in Birkenhead last year. He was ordered to pay more than \u00a345,000 in fines and costs at Liverpool magistrates court in April after failing to repair \u201cappalling\u201d housing for two years. Residents in three properties in Birkenhead and West Kirby were repeatedly left in \u201cshocking\u201d conditions, often without heating, water supplies or fire alarms. One property, where a 10-year-old child had lived for eight years, had a hole in the bathroom through which pigeon droppings fell. The court heard that repairs would have cost Fixter \u00a313,000. Fixter, 36, pleaded guilty to 45 offences between 2016 and 2018 but told the court that he was \u201cnot a rich man\u201d and owned a \u201cmodest portfolio\u201d of six properties, in which he said he had only accumulated equity worth \u00a3105,000 \u2013 equivalent to around a year\u2019s rental income from the flats. District judge Wendy Lloyd told the court that the housing conditions were \u201cshocking\u201d and urged Fixter to \u201cgive up being a landlord\u201d. She added: \u201cIt\u2019s a depressing case. The fact that people have to live like this is totally and utterly unacceptable \u2026 What a disgraceful state of affairs in a modern society.\u201d Fixter blamed \u201cshoddy\u201d builders, an \u201cobstructive tenant\u201d and the fact that his mother was ill and later died, as reasons he could not carry out the work. Fixter had been convicted in 2016 for similar offences at properties he owned in Scarborough, where he was ordered to pay \u00a342,000. During that case he was described as \u201cdespicable\u201d by a local councillor, after being found guilty of 18 offences, including some relating to his failure to adequately maintain the electrics within the building and allow dangerous live wires to be exposed in the common areas, which could have resulted in the death or serious injury of his tenants. Fixter has since sold his properties in Yorkshire and some of those that he owned in Wirral. He did not respond to invitations to comment. Adrian Webb: former firefighter who breached fire regulations Webb, 54, is a former firefighter who has been convicted of renting out a Liverpool property that breached fire regulations in 2016, in addition to other prosecutions that mark him out as a regular offender. He failed Liverpool city council\u2019s \u201cfit and proper\u201d person test after being convicted in 2015 for renting flats in breach of prohibition orders, which resulted in Webb and his wife, Lynn, being fined \u00a316,000 for letting the dangerous property. In May 2016 Webb was fined again, this time for a further \u00a360,000 after renting the same property before the urgent repairs were completed. The new residents had no heating, fire alarms or fire resistant doors, and the ceiling collapsed. The judge described the offences as \u201cabsolutely disgraceful\u201d. In July 2016, Webb was convicted by St Helens council over conditions at another of his rental properties, where council records show he was fined \u00a34,000 and made to pay costs and a victim surcharge. He has continued to let in St Helens. Webb, whose family home is a Merseyside property bought for \u00a3835,000 in 2007, told the Guardian: \u201cI formally request that you do not bring myself and family any more upset on this matter by reporting this. I was a victim of circumstances and it has caused me much hardship in many ways. I am trying to put this behind me.\u201d David McGuinness: \u2018tends to go for the lower end of the market\u2019 McGuinness is one of the 28 landlords that the London borough of Newham says it has banned. He failed the local authority\u2019s fit and proper person test in 2013 when he applied for a licence to act as a private landlord. As Newham has a licensing scheme that covers almost all of the borough, it effectively means he is not permitted to act as a landlord inside Newham\u2019s boundaries. He is known to Newham officials as someone who \u201ctends to go for the lower end of the market\u201d and has rented out a shed as somebody\u2019s home for \u00a3350 a month, a property that was raided with live wires spilling out from the mains electrical unit, and another infested with rats. The council has identified 48 McGuinness properties inside the local authority, although his portfolio is not restricted to Newham. For example, he owns property in Ilford which is licensed by the London borough of Redbridge, allowing it to be rented out by a third-party agent. McGuinness did not respond to invitations to comment. Katia Goremsandu: handed a criminal behaviour order Last year Katia Goremsandu, 57, was banned from managing property in the London boroughs of Westminster and Haringey for 10 years under a landmark court order handed out because of the dangerous condition of homes she rented out. She was handed a criminal behaviour order \u2013 usually used to control gang members or prolific drug offenders \u2013 in February 2017 after a prosecution by Westminster council for failing to comply with an improvement order, which resulted in her being convicted. Goremsandu was the \u201ccountry\u2019s worst landlord\u201d in 2015 \u2013 after being convicted of property offences seven times \u2013 but has argued she was the victim. She claimed her local council had persecuted her, and said her rental flats had been vandalised by tenants envious of her property wealth. She told the Guardian: \u201cThe mentality of a homeless person or the person who doesn\u2019t have work or a property is \u2018why should [the landlord] have [a property] and I don\u2019t?\u2019. And they bash it, they break it. It is a well-known fact. It is a state of mind. They punish you for being a landlord.\u201d A spokeswoman for Haringey council said Goremsandu\u2019s criminal behaviour order came after \u201cnumerous prosecutions for a range of housing offences \u2026 over a period of four years\u201d. Company records list Goremsandu\u2019s address as an apartment in a handsome Georgian villa in Bayswater, west London. She also owns a luxury property in Kensington, west London, which is currently occupied. In 2014 she was prosecuted for putting tenants at risk by covering a warning light on a faulty fire alarm with a black sticker in a house converted into seven flats in Tottenham. In 2015, when she first started to become known to the wider public, Haringey council estimated that Goremsandu\u2019s rental income was around \u00a3188,000 a year, including housing benefit payments. The council prosecuted her once again in 2016 for a licensing offence.

      "bodyText": "When Daud Hussein, a Somali who is blind in one eye, crawled naked and bleeding out of his north London home, it seemed that life could not get too much worse. But it did. He had been knocked unconscious after he fell when showering in the dark. A candle that had been lighting the bathroom had gone out. Hussein says he was using the candle after his landlord cut off the electricity. After dragging himself outside to find help, Hussein was eventually discovered by a neighbour, who clothed him and called an ambulance. He spent 10 days in St Mary\u2019s hospital near Paddington station, including four in the major trauma ward, as a result of swelling to the spinal cord that caused him to lose sensation in his leg, down the right side of his body and in both hands. Yet having been discharged, Hussein could not go home. He suspected his landlord had been trying to make him leave by disconnecting the electricity. Family members passed word from the landlord to Hussein in his hospital bed, he claimed. The message went: \u201cTell that black bastard that I have evicted him and his shit is outside.\u201d And so it proved. When Hussein returned to the property the locks had been changed and his belongings removed. Suddenly he was homeless. The details of the eviction, which took place in May 2015 when Hussein was 46, are contained within the witness statement he filed at Willesden county court when bringing a successful civil action against his then landlord, Bernard McGowan, a convicted property owner who boasts a \u00a330m portfolio. McGowan is familiar with court proceedings. He has been convicted under the Housing Act six times since 2014, and was fined more than \u00a3100,000 for property offences last year. The Guardian has spoken to five other McGowan tenants who have similar claims of intimidation, electricity being disconnected, locks being changed and deposits never being returned, as their landlord either forced \u2013 or attempted to force \u2013 them out of their homes. Others with knowledge of McGowan\u2019s practices also claim that he has thrown tenants out without going through the proper legal channels, which is an offence under the 1977 Protection from Eviction Act. Residents in the 25-home development in Kensal Green, Brent, where Hussein once lived, told how beds and tenants\u2019 personal possessions had been strewn outside the front doors of some of the 10 McGowan properties there. They suggest these were other examples of forced eviction that had occurred during the past year. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific,\u201d said one neighbour. But none of this appears out of the ordinary. Jacky Peacock, a director at a London charity called Advice4Renters, which has helped Hussein and other McGowan tenants build legal cases against the landlord, said: \u201c[McGowan] owns a large number of properties and he does tend to let to people who are either on very low income or maybe benefits who really have little bargaining power and little choice in where they live.\u201d Peacock claims McGowan will cram tenants in to maximise his rents and \u201cif there is any difficulty with any of the tenants \u2026 then he is likely to just evict them summarily\u201d. \u201cHe has almost no regard for the law and if he does get prosecuted he will just carry on in his own sweet way,\u201d she added. \u201cIf he does get caught every so often the fine will just be a business expense.\u201d The claims about McGowan\u2019s business practices range from the forced evictions to dire conditions inside his properties, where tenants are living in homes riddled with cold, damp and vermin. Last year McGowan was convicted by Brent council and ordered to pay \u00a341,488 in respect of a property in Harlesden where a couple with two children lived in a flat with mice, and mould on the ceiling caused by damp. Council housing inspectors also recorded that the flat had insufficient heating, broken windows and a \u201clarge gap at the bottom [of the front door] allowing cold air, rain and also vermin to enter\u201d. McGowan should never have been letting the property, as he had failed the council\u2019s \u201cfit and proper\u201d person test and did not have a licence to be a landlord in the borough. But there was more. During 2017, he was prosecuted by Brent for another licensing breach at a property he owns in Wembley. He also received two further licensing convictions in neighbouring Camden, where he was ordered to pay a total of \u00a368,435. Yet still McGowan\u2019s properties continue to be let out. Over the past three months the Guardian and ITV have gathered evidence from tenants in at least four other properties owned by McGowan that suggests the necessary Brent licences are missing. If correct, it could be a criminal offence. Two McGowan properties were suddenly licensed, under agents\u2019 names, at the beginning of October well after journalists started asking questions. Many of McGowan\u2019s current tenants in licensed and unlicensed properties also suggest how problems \u2013 such as faulty heating or leaks \u2013 go ignored for months. Properties belonging to the landlord also continue to be let out in Camden, Newham and Hertfordshire, where his failure of Brent\u2019s \u201cfit and proper\u201d test is irrelevant. Failing a fit and proper person test does not mean that all or any of the landlord\u2019s properties are unfit. Few tenants dare speak out publicly, fearing eviction, but when McGowan is challenged by those with less to lose, he appears weaker. When the Guardian and ITV News confronted McGowan outside his office in Radlett, Hertfordshire, he locked himself inside a cafe toilet for half an hour to avoid questions. In his rush to escape, he jumped into the wrong waiting cab. He declined other requests for comment. A former McGowan tenant, Erskine Clarke, told of how he moved into one of the landlord\u2019s properties after a spell being homeless and sleeping on night buses. His \u00a3194-a-week housing benefit pays for a room that measures just 3.5 metres (12ft) by 2.5 metres (8ft) in a shared house in Harlesden where McGowan operated as the landlord until last year, but which is now being renovated. Crammed into the space are a double bed, a fridge-freezer, a microwave, a television, a record player and a music collection. \u201cThe bathroom was mouldy,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cThere was the coldness in the house, the boiler not working. [The problem with the boiler] was going on for two years. It kept on cutting out. No hot water, no central heating. I suffer with arthritis as well. When you stay in a cold room every day you can feel it all in your bones and everything. That\u2019s how I feel it most of the time. I have to use crutches sometimes. \u201cNobody should be living in the state like it was in. It made me depressed. I lost a lot of weight and got very sick [because of the] cold and depression. \u201c[McGowan] doesn\u2019t care. I think all he cares about is what money he makes. As long as he gets paid, he\u2019s fine,\u201d Clarke claimed, before asking, in a voice barely above a whisper: \u201cWhy does the government just let people do this?\u201d",

They suggest these were other examples of forced eviction that had occurred during the past year. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific,\u201d said one neighbour.</p> \n<p>But none of this appears out of the ordinary.</p> \n<p>Jacky Peacock, a director at a London charity called Advice4Renters, which has helped Hussein and other McGowan tenants build legal cases against the landlord, said: \u201c[McGowan] owns a large number of properties and he does tend to let to people who are either on very low income or maybe benefits who really have little bargaining power and little choice in where they live.\u201d</p> \n<p>Peacock claims McGowan will cram tenants in to maximise his rents and \u201cif there is any difficulty with any of the tenants \u2026 then he is likely to just evict them summarily\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe has almost no regard for the law and if he does get prosecuted he will just carry on in his own sweet way,\u201d she added. \u201cIf he does get caught every so often the fine will just be a business expense.\u201d</p> \n<p>The claims about McGowan\u2019s business practices range from the forced evictions to dire conditions inside his properties, where tenants are living in homes riddled with cold, damp and vermin.</p> \n<p>Last year McGowan was convicted by Brent council and ordered to pay \u00a341,488 in respect of a property in Harlesden where a couple with two children lived in a flat with mice, and mould on the ceiling caused by damp.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c0e6b6683ca756dddc25c9eea197b8849bd92a96\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0e6b6683ca756dddc25c9eea197b8849bd92a96/0_0_1936_2592/747.jpg\" alt=\"Broken heating in a Bernard McGowan property in 2016.\" width=\"747\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A picture taken in 2016 of broken heating in a Bernard McGowan property.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Council housing inspectors also recorded that the flat had insufficient heating, broken windows and a \u201clarge gap at the bottom [of the front door] allowing cold air, rain and also vermin to enter\u201d. McGowan should never have been letting the property, as he had failed the council\u2019s \u201cfit and proper\u201d person test and did not have a licence to be a landlord in the borough.</p> \n<p>But there was more. During 2017, he was prosecuted by Brent for another licensing breach at a property he owns in Wembley. He also received two further licensing convictions in neighbouring Camden, where he was ordered to pay a total of \u00a368,435.</p> \n<p>Yet still McGowan\u2019s properties continue to be let out. Over the past three months the Guardian and ITV have gathered evidence from tenants in at least four other properties owned by McGowan that suggests the necessary Brent licences are missing. If correct, it could be a criminal offence. Two McGowan properties were suddenly licensed, under agents\u2019 names, at the beginning of October well after journalists started asking questions. Many of McGowan\u2019s current tenants in licensed and unlicensed properties also suggest how problems \u2013 such as faulty heating or leaks \u2013 go ignored for months.</p> \n<p>Properties belonging to the landlord also continue to be let out in Camden, Newham and Hertfordshire, where his failure of Brent\u2019s \u201cfit and proper\u201d test is irrelevant. Failing a fit and proper person test does not mean that all or any of the landlord\u2019s properties are unfit.</p> \n<p>Few tenants dare speak out publicly, fearing eviction, but when McGowan is challenged by those with less to lose, he appears weaker. When the Guardian and ITV News confronted McGowan outside his office in Radlett, Hertfordshire, he locked himself inside a cafe toilet for half an hour to avoid questions. In his rush to escape, he jumped into the wrong waiting cab. He declined other requests for comment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9622f8af-234d-42b5-b762-90ef6cd8fdeb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wB92UaK7EAM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A former McGowan tenant, Erskine Clarke, told of how he moved into one of the landlord\u2019s properties after a spell being homeless and sleeping on night buses.</p> \n<p>His \u00a3194-a-week housing benefit pays for a room that measures just 3.5 metres (12ft) by 2.5 metres (8ft) in a shared house in Harlesden where McGowan operated as the landlord until last year, but which is now being renovated. Crammed into the space are a double bed, a fridge-freezer, a microwave, a television, a record player and a music collection.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe bathroom was mouldy,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cThere was the coldness in the house, the boiler not working. [The problem with the boiler] was going on for two years. It kept on cutting out. No hot water, no central heating. I suffer with arthritis as well. When you stay in a cold room every day you can feel it all in your bones and everything. That\u2019s how I feel it most of the time. I have to use crutches sometimes.</p> \n<p>\u201cNobody should be living in the state like it was in. It made me depressed. I lost a lot of weight and got very sick [because of the] cold and depression.</p> \n<p>\u201c[McGowan] doesn\u2019t care. I think all he cares about is what money he makes. As long as he gets paid, he\u2019s fine,\u201d Clarke claimed, before asking, in a voice barely above a whisper: \u201cWhy does the government just let people do this?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Convicted landlords who have been ruled unfit to rent out their properties are continuing to operate by exploiting loopholes in the law that is supposed to protect the most vulnerable tenants. The rogue owners are collecting rents \u2013 often funded by taxpayers via housing benefit \u2013 despite being convicted of housing offences and failing to pass the \u201cfit and proper\u201d person tests required by housing legislation in England and Wales, an investigation by the Guardian and ITV News has found. Because of the way the law is written, this is usually perfectly legal. The Guardian and ITV News have also discovered that local authorities have failed to make a single entry on to the central government\u2019s new rogue landlord database in the six months since its launch. Prior to the database launch the government had estimated there were 10,500 rogue landlords operating in England, and said it expected more than 600 of the worst offenders to be entered onto the system. The contents of the database are being kept secret from the public, and the government said it was \u201cnot in the public interest\u201d to explain why. Convicted landlords judged unfit, but who are still in business, include: \u2022 Bernard McGowan, a rogue landlord who boasts of a \u00a330m property empire, and who has been convicted six times of housing offences since 2014. He has failed the \u201cfit and proper\u201d landlord test in Brent, north London, but McGowan properties continue to be rented out there, in the other London boroughs of Camden and Newham, and in Hertfordshire. \u2022 Gary Fixter, described as a \u201cdespicable\u201d landlord by a local councillor after being convicted of housing offences in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, in 2016. He was convicted again in Wirral in April this year, when he was told by a judge to \u201cgive up\u201d renting out property because of the \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d conditions in his homes. Since then he has been renting out properties in Chester and Wirral. \u2022 Adrian Webb, a former firefighter convicted of renting out a Liverpool property that breached fire regulations in 2016, who has failed the city council\u2019s fit and proper person test. He is currently renting out property in neighbouring St Helens, where he was also successfully prosecuted in 2016 for failing to deal with damp and mould in one of his properties. \u2022 David McGuinness, a landlord who rented out a home described as a \u201cshed in the back garden of a shabbily converted bedsit property\u201d in 2012 and who is one of 28 individuals Newham says it has \u201cbanned\u201d after failing the council\u2019s fit and proper person test. McGuinness owns property in Ilford which is licensed by the neighbouring London borough of Redbridge to be rented out by a third-party agent. \u2022 Katia Goremsandu, once dubbed the \u201ccountry\u2019s worst landlord\u201d, who has been convicted on multiple occasions. Goremsandu has now been banned from managing homes in two London boroughs \u2013 Westminster and Haringey \u2013 under legislation usually used to control gang members or prolific drug offenders. She continues to own property in London that is rented out to tenants and someone is occupying a luxury flat she owns in Kensington, west London. Under the existing legislation, a landlord can fail the fit and proper person test in one borough but continue legally renting out properties in other boroughs. The law also allows landlords to continue renting out homes in the borough where they are banned so long as they are managed by an approved third party. Failing a fit and proper person test does not mean that all or any of the landlord\u2019s properties are unfit. The licensing of landlords was introduced as part of the Housing Act, which came into force in 2006 and was billed as a way of forcing rogue landlords to clean up their acts. It gave councils the power to refuse a landlord a licence if the local authority did not deem them to be a fit and proper person to rent out property to tenants. In order to decide whether a landlord is fit and proper, the legislation says local authorities must consider whether \u201cthe landlord has] contravened any provision of the law relating to housing or of landlord and tenant law\u201d. However, it is rare for councils to judge that a landlord is not fit and proper. The Guardian and ITV News\u2019 findings have prompted experts to question whether local authorities have the resources to use existing laws, as well as recently enhanced enforcement powers. Jacky Peacock, a director of the tenants\u2019 charity Advice4Renters, said: \u201cHaving campaigned for many years to get [landlord] licensing on the statute books, we\u2019ve been devastated that implementation has been so flawed. \u201cWe see licences being issued even where a landlord has had previous convictions so shouldn\u2019t reasonably be deemed to be a fit and proper person as the law requires. Even if he is prevented from holding a licence in one area, there\u2019s a good chance he will be operating somewhere else.\u201d One leading housing academic said legislation governing the country\u2019s private rented sector needed a complete overhaul. Julie Rugg, a senior research fellow at the University of York\u2019s Centre for Housing Policy who co-authored a study published last month on England\u2019s private rented sector, said the legislation needed a complete overhaul: \u201cThere is a lot to be said for saying: \u2018You know what, can we just start again?\u2019 \u201cThe more new legislation comes in, the chances of it not working in practice, with all the other legislation that\u2019s in play, increases. \u201cAt the moment, everyone is agreed that nothing is working.\u201d The University of York\u2019s study found that 250,000 families in England were bringing up babies and infants in privately rented accommodation that failed to meet the decent homes standard. The scale of that finding suggests the private rented sector is blighted by more than just a small minority of rogue operators. The authors of the research back the introduction of a \u201cproperty MOT\u201d \u2013 like the system that exists for cars \u2013 in which all properties let for residential purposes would need an annual standardised inspection by approved experts. Since 2013, landlord licensing schemes have expanded, but they vary hugely across the country, and even within the same local authority area there can be less stringent licence requirements in certain wards. In addition to licensing, new legislation was introduced in April this year that could lead to the most serious offenders being banned from renting out property anywhere in England. Heather Wheeler MP, the minister for housing and homelessness, said: \u201cEveryone deserves a decent and safe place to live, and we are reforming the private rented sector to make it fairer for all. \u201cThrough fines, banning orders and the new rogue landlord database \u2013 warmly welcomed by councils \u2013 we have provided authorities with new enforcement tools to help them crack down on the minority of landlords who exploit tenants.\u201d However, Peacock added: \u201cSince April this year, the government has given local authorities the power to issue banning orders, which would prevent a particular landlord from letting any properties. But if they cannot [use existing powers to] take over control of a single property, why should anyone think they will adopt a far bolder approach?\u201d Eleanor Southwood, a councillor and cabinet member for housing and welfare reform in Brent, said: \u201cWe are appalled by the way Mr McGowan consistently failed to meet standards, which resulted in our two convictions against him. We take the rights of tenants incredibly seriously. We work with all landlords because this is the best way to ensure that their tenants are protected.\u201d McGowan did not respond to requests for comment and when approached outside his Hertfordshire office by the Guardian and ITV News, he hid in a cafe toilet for half an hour to avoid questions and called a taxi to pick him up outside. Webb, who was ruled not fit and proper by Liverpool council, said: \u201cI formally request that you do not bring myself and family any more upset on this matter by reporting this. I was a victim of circumstances and it has caused me much hardship in many ways. I am trying to put this behind me.\u201d Fixter, McGuinness and Goremsandu did not respond to efforts to contact them.",

The death in June of the 61-year-old TV chef and writer Bourdain resulted in a jump in sales of his no-holds-barred insider\u2019s take on the New York restaurant business that catapulted him to fame when it was published in 2000. Nigel Newton, the chief executive of Bloomsbury Publishing, said of the recent Kitchen Confidential sales: \u201cIt was unexpected; there were a lot of ebook downloads, a lot of people wanted to read his master work.\u201d The Harry Potter franchise continues to be Bloomsbury\u2019s biggest money-maker with sales up 5% in the first half of this year, despite the surge in popularity last year before the 20th anniversary of JK Rowling\u2019s creation. \u201cLast year\u2019s Harry Potter anniversary generated one of the highest levels of revenue since the initial publications, and we\u2019ve been pleased to build on this momentum in the first half,\u201d Newton said. If not for the growth in Harry Potter sales, Bloomsbury\u2019s income from its children\u2019s division, which remained flat at \u00a331m in the first half, would have fallen 9% year-on-year. Newton blamed this on timings, with its biggest new children\u2019s title of this year, the fantasy author Sarah J Maas\u2019s Kingdom of Ash, published just outside the first-half reporting period. The publisher was also boosted by sales of Michael Ondaatje\u2019s The English Patient, which was awarded the \u201cBooker of Bookers\u201d earlier this year, to help lift revenues in the first half by 4% to \u00a375.3m. Adjusted profits, stripping out costs relating to the purchase of the London-based academic publisher IB Tauris, rose 13% to \u00a32.9m. Revenues at Bloomsbury\u2019s adult division, home to releases such as Kamila Shamsie\u2019s Home Fire and Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge, grew by 22% to \u00a315.9m. The adult and children\u2019s operations fall under Bloomsbury\u2019s consumer division, where revenues rose by 5% to \u00a347m. Bloomsbury wants to reduce its dependence on consumer titles, a necessity given the Harry Potter series has ended, and has been investing in academic and professional publishing. The business currently derives 62% of revenues from its consumer operation. \u201cIt would be ideal to be 50/50,\u201d Newton said. \u201cWe are looking to be the perfectly balanced company.\u201d Just 13% of total revenues come from digital sources, such as ebooks and subscriptions to academic resources.",

      "bodyText": "Premier Inn\u2019s owner, Whitbread, is planning a major push into the German hotels market after the sale of its Costa Coffee business to Coca-Cola. Alison Brittain, Whitbread\u2019s chief executive, said the company would plough some of the proceeds from the agreed \u00a33.9bn sale into expanding its hotels business but a \u201csignificant proportion\u201d of the money would be returned to shareholders. Whitbread is rolling out its Premier Inn chain in Germany, where it has one hotel in Frankfurt, with more hotels to open in Munich and Hamburg in the coming months. It expects to have 33 hotels with 6,000 rooms in Germany by 2021, which would make it one of the biggest budget hotel operators in that country. It said the German hotel market was 35% larger than the UK\u2019s and similar to the UK a decade ago, as a shift from independent hotels to branded hotels gets under way. Like-for-like sales at Premier Inn almost ground to a halt in the six months to 30 August, rising only 0.2% as consumer demand softened over the summer. Bookings from leisure travellers weakened outside London but this was offset by demand from business customers. More than 80% of its rooms were occupied over the period. Nicholas Cadbury, Whitbread\u2019s finance director, said weekend bookings had been weaker than midweek bookings into September, reflecting the weaker consumer backdrop. As well as growth in Germany, Whitbread will focus on a UK \u201csuper budget\u201d hotel brand, Zip, launched on Monday. Zip will be a spin-off from its main Premier Inn brand, featuring pod-style rooms half the size of a Premier Inn room at only 8.5 sq m and priced from \u00a319 a night. The first hotels are due to open in Cardiff and Southampton next year. Brittain said Zip would be aimed at people for whom Premier Inn\u2019s \u00a349-plus room rates are too expensive and are currently staying at B&amp;Bs, sleeping in their vans or on friends\u2019 floors, or driving long distances. She said this market could be worth \u00a31bn a year. At the same time Whitbread plans to add a further five to six boutique hotels under the hub brand to the existing 10, most of them in London and with the rest in Edinburgh. Hub rooms cost from \u00a369 a night and feature bespoke Hypnos beds, a choice of pillows, monsoon showers and 40-inch TVs. Whitbread is the biggest hotel operator in Britain, with 800 budget hotels and 74,000 rooms, and hopes to get to 100,000 rooms in the next few years. Its main rival, Travelodge, runs 560 hotels. Whitbread \u2013 a 276-year-old business \u2013 also operates restaurant brands including Beefeater and Brewers Fayre that serve its hotels.",

Monsanto, now owned by Bayer, the German pharmaceutical company, filed an appeal of the verdict, which said the company was responsible for \u201cnegligent failure\u201d, knew or should have known that its product was \u201cdangerous\u201d, and had \u201cacted with malice or oppression\u201d. Monsanto fought to overturn the verdict, arguing the evidence was insufficient. The San Francisco superior court judge Suzanne Bolanos had suggested in an initial written ruling this month that she was considering granting a new trial. But she ultimately denied Monsanto\u2019s request. However, she has ruled to reduce punitive damages from $250m to $39m. The judge said in her ruling on Monday that if Johnson did not accept the lower punitive damages, she would order a new trial for Monsanto. Johnson\u2019s lawyers said in a statement on Monday that the \u201creduction in punitive damages was unwarranted\u201d and that his legal team, Baum Hedlund and the Miller Firm, was \u201cweighing the options\u201d. They added, \u201cThe evidence presented to this jury was, quite frankly, overwhelming \u2026 Today is a triumph for our legal system. We care deeply for Lee and his family, and we are excited to share this important win with them and all those who supported this case.\u201d Bayer said in a statement that the reduction in damages was a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d, but that the company planned to file another appeal of the verdict. The August verdict was a major victory for campaigners who have long fought Roundup, the most widely used herbicide in the world. Studies have repeatedly linked the glyphosate chemical, sold under the Roundup and Ranger Pro brands, to non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a type of blood cancer. In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer ruled to classify glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen. Johnson\u2019s lawyers further argued that internal Monsanto emails uncovered in the litigation suggested that the corporation has repeatedly worked to stifle critical research over the years while \u201cghost-writing\u201d scientific reports favorable to glyphosate. Thousands of plaintiffs across the country have made similar legal claims, alleging that glyphosate exposure caused their cancer or resulted in the deaths of their loved ones. Monsanto and Bayer have repeatedly insisted that glyphosate is safe to use and does not cause cancer. Last week, four jury members spoke to the Guardian about the judge questioning their unanimous decision, urging her to allow the verdict to stand. In a recent interview, Johnson told the Guardian that he wanted to see his case have a long-term impact, including new restrictions and labeling for the herbicide. \u201cI hope [Monsanto] gets the message that people in America and across the world are not ignorant. They have already done their own research,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m hoping that it snowballs and people really get the picture and they start to make decisions about what they eat, what they spray in their farms.\u201d Johnson could have months to live and is not expected to survive beyond two years.",
