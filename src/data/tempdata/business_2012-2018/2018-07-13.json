      "bodyText": "Kylie Jenner is on track to become the world\u2019s youngest ever billionaire thanks to her lips and Instagram. Jenner, 20, the youngest member of the Kardashian-Jenner American reality TV family, is the founder and sole owner of Kylie Cosmetics, the makeup company she runs largely from her black iPhone X, with the help of her mother Kris. Employing just seven full-time staff, Kylie Cosmetics has sold more than $630m (\u00a3480m) of lipstick, lip liner and lip gloss and makeup since Jenner founded the business on Valentine\u2019s Day in 2016. Forbes magazine, which this week featured Jenner on its cover as the face of \u201cthe era of extreme fame leverage\u201d, estimated her \u201cnet worth\u201d at $900m. The magazine said Kylie Cosmetics is growing at such a rate that she is likely to become a billionaire at 22 \u2013 a year younger than Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg was when he joined the \u2018nine zeros\u2019 club in 2008. Billionaires are getting younger. Legendary investor Warren Buffett, who is now the world\u2019s third-richest person with an $83bn fortune, did not make his first billion until 1986, when he was 56. Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and the world\u2019s richest person with $145bn, became a billionaire at 35 in 1999. Google co-founder Larry Page made his first billion at 30 in 2004 when the search engine floated. Evan Spiegel, founder of Snapchat, became a billionaire in 2015 at 25. Nearly all of Kylie Cosmetic\u2019s sales come directly from Jenner\u2019s social media accounts. She has 111m followers on Instagram (77% of whom are aged 18-24, the BBC reports), is one of the most viewed accounts on Snapchat, and is followed by 25m on Twitter. Such is the weight of her influence that when she tweeted that she was \u201csooo over\u201d Snapchat earlier this year, more than $1bn was wiped off the company\u2019s stock market value. Sales are driven higher by Jenner sparking FOMO (fear of missing out) among her fans with warnings that collections are in very limited quantities. Her initial stock of $29 \u201clip kits\u201d - matching lipstick and lip liner - sold out in less than a minute, crashing the website. Jenner, who has been in the public eye since she made her debut on Keeping Up With The Kardashians a decade ago when she was 10, said: \u201cSocial media is an amazing platform. I have such easy access to my fans and my customers.\u201d The business is almost totally outsourced. Jenner comes up with ideas for styles, but the products are made by Seed Beauty, a private-label producer which also produces makeup for KKW Beauty, run by Jenner\u2019s half-sister Kim Kardashian West. More than 500 people at Seed Beauty, which owns makeup production company Spatz Laboratories, work on the Jenner-Kardashian brands. Spatz, which is run by siblings John and Laura Nelson, was sued by L\u2019Or\u00e9al in 2016 over allegations that L\u2019Or\u00e9al patents were used in the creation of Kylie Cosmetic lip products. Jenner does not directly make her products, nor does she sell them. Kylie Cosmetics\u2019 orders and sales are outsourced to Shopify, a Canadian online company that also runs shops for Drake and Justin Bieber. Shopify promotes its success with Jenner to encourage other entrepreneurs to skip the boring things like fulfilling orders and logistics by using their services. \u201cThe reigning Queen of Snapchat. Reality TV darling. Makeup mogul. She\u2019s more than just a famous face\u2014the youngest of the Kardashian clan, Kylie Jenner, has hustled beyond her 19 years, monetising her name and exploding it into a massive cosmetics brand,\u201d Shopify says on its site. \u201cKylie Cosmetics entered the IRL (in real life) space for the first time ever, driving lip envy to a fever pitch.\u201d Jenner also does not have to worry much about the business\u2019s finances or the day-to-day management of her 12 staff (seven full-time, five part-time). Those matters are outsourced to her mom or \u201cmomager\u201d Kris Jenner, who manages all her children\u2019s financial operations \u2013 in return for a 10% cut. Jenner, who used her reality TV exposure to secure modelling work with brands like Topshop, said she had struggled to decide what to do with her life. Then her thoughts turned to her most talked about feature: her lips. Until she finally admitted using fillers, fans tried desperately to ape her full-lipped look by sucking on bottles. The \u201cKylie Jenner lip challenge\u201d increases blood flow to the lips, with often unpleasant-looking results. This week, however, Jenner said she has had all filler removed, after learning to live with the natural look while pregnant with her daughter Stormi, who is now five months old. Jenner trademarked the phrase \u201cKylie Lip Kits ... for the perfect pout\u201d two years before setting up her company with $250,000 of money she had made through modelling and reality TV work. \u201cEver since I was probably 15 I\u2019ve been obsessed with lipstick. I could never find a lip liner and a lipstick that were the perfect match. So that\u2019s where I thought of the idea that I wanted to create my own product,\u201d Jenner said in an interview with Shopify. While she had a huge fan base, Jenner said she was scared that sales might not take off when the website first launched. \u201cI kept calling my mom, saying: \u2018Mom, I\u2019m so scared. Do you think it\u2019s going to sell?\u2019 Because I put all my money upfront. You know, it\u2019s all my money. I put everything into this.\u201d Now the business is soaring, Jenner - who drives a Bentley Bentayga which is priced from \u00a3162,700 - is considering turning it into a family firm. \u201cMaybe one day [I\u2019ll] pass this on to Stormi, if she\u2019s into it,\u201d Jenner told Forbes. Though her mother said selling up is \u201calways something that we\u2019re willing to explore\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s trade surplus with the US widened to a record in June, risking further escalation of a a bitter trade dispute with Washington. The difference between China\u2019s exports to the US and its imports from the world\u2019s largest economy expanded to a monthly high of $29bn (\u00a322bn), up from $24.6bn in May. China\u2019s exports to the US jumped by 13.6% in the first half of 2018 from a year earlier, while its imports from the US rose 11.8% in the same period. Jonas Short, head of the Beijing office at investment firm Everbright Sun Hung Kai, said it \u201cwon\u2019t help already sour relations and escalating tensions\u201d. Earlier this week Donald Trump proposed a 10% tariff on $200bn of Chinese goods entering the US, saying that tariffs already in place on steel and aluminium imports and $34bn of goods had failed to force significant reforms by Beijing. Trump\u2019s advisers are attempting to open Chinese markets to foreign companies and reduce what they see as unfair subsidies that have given rise to a $340bn annual trade deficit with China. The record deficit last month threatens to irritate the White House, which wants to see the extra tariffs on imports reversing the recent trend. However, analysts said the June figures were a sign that exporters rushed to beat the initial tranche of tariffs, which came into effect in the first week of July. They said as a consequence figures for July and August were likely to show a decline in exports to the US. China\u2019s commerce ministry confirmed last month that Chinese exporters were front-loading exports to the US to get ahead of expected tariffs \u2013 a situation that could exacerbate any slowdown in shipments toward the year end. \u201cLooking ahead, export growth will cool in the coming months as US tariffs start to bite alongside a broader softening in global demand,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard, the senior China economist at Capital Economics in Singapore, said. Analysts also pointed out that Chinese export growth slowed to 11.3% year on year in June, from 12.2% in May, illustrating that exporters, faced with the threat of further trade barriers, were becoming more circumspect in sending goods abroad. Washington has warned it may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500bn worth of Chinese goods \u2013 nearly the total amount of US imports from China last year. So far China has responded in kind, adding tariffs to $34bn of goods from the US and threatening \u201cfirm and forceful measures\u201d to match the threat of tariffs on $200bn worth of US exports. The dispute has jolted global financial markets, raising worries that a full-scale trade war could derail the world economy. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, has warned of \u201cdarker clouds looming\u201d for the global economy amid simmering trade tensions between the US and China, urging governments around the world to steer clear of protectionism or face negative consequences. Global markets largely shrugged off the figures, with the FTSE 100 finishing the day up 10.54 points at 7661. However, Chinese stocks fell into bear market territory at the end of last month and the yuan currency has skidded, although there have been signs this week its central bank is moving to slow the currency\u2019s declines.",

      "bodyText": "The Argentine restaurant group Gaucho is teetering on the brink of administration, putting 1,500 jobs at risk, as it races to secure a deal that will help it pay a \u00a31m-plus tax bill. The company is understood to be weighing three potential rescue deals before a late-night deadline for the bill by HM Revenue &amp; Customs on Friday. Sources said it was hoped that a deal could be completed within the next few days. Any rescue is likely to involve only the16 Gaucho restaurants, which employ around 800 people, with all or most of its Cau casual dining chain, which employs 700, closing down. Final proposals are understood to have been filed on Friday by Hugh Osmond, the former Pizza Express backer; Gaucho\u2019s existing management team backed by Core Capital, part of the private equity firm ESO Capital, as well as by Limerston Capital, an investor in companies including Spark Energy, as first reported by Sky News. The bidders are all expected to offer significantly less money than the \u00a350m owed by Gaucho to its banks and sources said the process remained \u201cuncertain\u201d. The privately owned group appointed the advisory firm KPMG in May to help assess options for its future and particularly the feasibility of Cau, which has 22 restaurants around the country. The Cau restaurant chain, which serves up burgers, steaks and brunch with a Buenos Aires theme, has suffered sales declines in double digits for more than a year. The Gaucho chain has fared better but is also understood to have been hit by a fall in profits. A company spokesperson said: \u201cWe have been managing our cash tightly as we near completion of the options process. We remain confident that the Gaucho business will emerge from this process on a more stable footing.\u201d Gaucho is one of a number of casual dining groups to have suffered amid heavy competition, rising costs and a squeeze on consumer spending. Restaurant chains including Carluccio\u2019s, Prezzo, which is the owner of the Chimichanga chain, Jamie\u2019s Italian and the upmarket burger bar Byron have all been forced to close outlets in recent months because of a \u201ccasual dining crunch\u201d. The shakeout comes after a bubble of investment in casual dining by private equity firms as the sector experienced strong growth driven by a shift to spending on experiences. Restaurateurs have joined a string of retailers, including Mothercare and Carpetright, in using company voluntary arrangements, a form of insolvency that enables them to renegotiate leases, in order to exit unwanted outlets. The private equity firm Equistone bought the Gaucho group in January 2016, having backed a management buyout in 2005. In January, it hired Oliver Meakin, the former boss of the electronics store Maplin, which collapsed into administration in February.",

Its chief executive, Kevin Keaney, said the 447-strong chain was aiming to open 50 more outlets a year as the market was \u201ccrying out for a really family-friendly retailer\u201d. Keaney said: \u201cUndoubtedly there are tough times but really well-run discount retailers like B&amp;M, Primark, Home Bargains and ourselves are doing really well \u2026 our whole strategy is to take money away from full-price specialists like WH Smith with disruptive pricing.\u201d The chairman, Dean Hoyle, who owns Huddersfield Town FC and is worth about \u00a3350m, thanks to the sale of the Card Factory business he founded, is set to make \u00a31m by selling shares. He will also retain a 14% stake worth a further \u00a314m at the float price. Endless, the private equity firm that owns the chain, is selling shares worth \u00a330m and retains a 10% stake worth \u00a310m. Nick Bubb, a retail analyst, expressed surprise that The Works had been able to finalise its initial public offering, which was first mentioned in the spring. \u201cWe had assumed the IPO dream had died, in the face of the gloom about the high street and the demise of Poundworld,\u201d he said. On Friday, The Works said it had set its initial share price at 160p, which equates to a market capitalisation of \u00a3100m when the company joins the stock market on 19 July. The offer will raise \u00a365.2m, of which \u00a328.5m will go to the company, mostly to pay off debts, while \u00a336.7m will go to shareholders. The Works was bought out of administration by the private equity firm Endless and Anthony Solomon, an entrepreneur, in 2008 for an estimated \u00a315m. In the past three years, sales have risen 14% to \u00a3189.3m and underlying profits are up 14% to \u00a312m. The group was founded by Mike and Jane Crossley in 1981 as discount bookstore Remainders Limited. It was rebranded as The Works in 2003 when the Crossleys sold out to the first of a string of private equity owners. Keaney, who joined The Works in 2012, said the retailer was showing it was possible to sell online and on the high street as a discounter. Sales of items ordered online but picked up in stores have risen by 60% in the past year, helping draw in new shoppers. The company also used a loyalty scheme to reduce marketing costs and is able to change its product ranges quickly to meet changing needs. This summer it has given a fifth of its shop floor space to summer toys such as bubble machines, water pistols and unicorn paddling pools, double the usual amount, helping it to maximise sales during the heatwave. \u201cWe are absolutely different. We have been bucking the market for some time not just in our performance but in the way we are doing things,\u201d Keaney said.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair passengers will face more disruption later this month with two further pilot strikes due to take place in Ireland. The Irish Air Line\u2019s Pilots\u2019 Association has announced two further 24-hour stoppages on 20 and 24 July, after 30 flights were cancelled due to a walkout on Thursday. This week\u2019s action affected about 5,000 passengers, including those on Ryanair\u2019s busy Ireland-UK routes, after pilots staged a strike over pay and their conditions of employment. The budget airline said that most of their customers impacted by Thursday\u2019s strike were offered alternative transport or refunds. The company\u2019s management and IALPA held marathon talks on Wednesday in an attempt to resolve the issues, but the talks broke down and the strike went ahead. The union said it was regrettable that Ryanair management had so far rejected the suggestion of third-party assistance to break the deadlock. Ryanair, which has mounted a drive to recognise unions in an attempt to quell staff unrest, faces disruption elsewhere in Europe this month. Cabin and ground crew from Spain, Italy, Portugal and Belgium have agreed to stage a walkout on 25 and 26 July, saying Ryanair has failed to address a list of demands presented to the company in a \u201ccrew charter\u201d this week. Ireland\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said: \u201cOur concern is that this dispute is resolved quickly and the travelling public is not discommoded in a significant way. As such, it is regrettable that the dispute was not solved when the two parties and their representatives engaged with each other. \u201cAs a government we want to encourage both sides to find a resolution as quickly as possible. A lot of people rely on Ryanair to travel \u2013 for business, holidays and other needs.\u201d",

This week\u2019s action affected about 5,000 passengers, including those on Ryanair\u2019s busy Ireland-UK routes, after pilots <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/07/ryanair-strikes-their-brand-is-built-on-being-reliable-bastards\">staged a strike</a> over pay and their conditions of employment. </p> <p>The budget airline said that most of their customers impacted by Thursday\u2019s strike were offered alternative transport or refunds. The company\u2019s management and IALPA held marathon talks on Wednesday in an attempt to resolve the issues, but the talks broke down and the strike went ahead. The union said it was regrettable that Ryanair management had so far rejected the suggestion of third-party assistance to break the deadlock. </p> <p>Ryanair, which has mounted a drive to recognise unions in an attempt to quell staff unrest, faces disruption elsewhere in Europe this month. Cabin and ground crew from Spain, Italy, Portugal and Belgium have agreed to stage a walkout on 25 and 26 July, saying Ryanair has failed to address a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/04/ryanair-crew-could-join-pilots-strike-action-over-pay-and-conditions\">list of demands presented to the company</a> in a \u201ccrew charter\u201d this week.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said: \u201cOur concern is that this dispute is resolved quickly and the travelling public is not discommoded in a significant way. As such, it is regrettable that the dispute was not solved when the two parties and their representatives engaged with each other. </p> <p>\u201cAs a government we want to encourage both sides to find a resolution as quickly as possible. A lot of people rely on Ryanair to travel \u2013 for business, holidays and other needs.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A Bank of England deputy governor has signalled he is unlikely to vote for an interest rate rise while wage increases remain more subdued than the Bank\u2019s forecasts. In a speech in Cumbria, Jon Cunliffe said the lack of strong wages growth meant there was a case for \u201cstodginess\u201d or caution before raising interest rates, leaving him isolated on the nine-strong monetary policy committee. The MPC meets next month and is expected to increase the base rate from 0.5% to 0.75% after hawkish speeches by the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, and its chief economist, Andy Haldane. Other members of the committee have indicated their readiness to raise rates. A poll of City analysts by Reuters has given an 80% probability of a rate rise in August. Many high street lenders have already put up their loan rates after forecasts of a rise in May, but the MPC scuppered the move, saying a delay was needed to assess the damage to growth from bad weather in March. Cunliffe said: \u201c[Caution is] the policy strategy that best and carefully nurtures the slow healing that I now believe is increasingly taking hold.\u201d He added: \u201cLooking to the medium term, there remains a case for a little \u2018stodginess\u2019 yet.\u201d Cunliffe, one of two MPC members who voted against the rate rise in November, said the economy appeared to be growing about as fast as the Bank predicted in May, but that wages growth had slipped and was not rising at the 3% annual rate forecast. He said the UK, along with many other western economies, remained deeply affected by the 2008 financial crisis and an ageing population that had led to a huge accumulation of savings. The growth of savings denied economies vital funds for consumer spending and investment, a process economists have dubbed \u201csecular stagnation\u201d. He told the Cumbria chamber of commerce in Kendal that while fears of secular stagnation were probably exaggerated, the economy needed a long time to heal. A tighter monetary policy would potentially harm that healing process. In the three months to April, the jobless total dropped by 38,000 to 1.42 million, to leave the unemployment rate at 4.2%, the lowest since 1975. Despite the fall in unemployment, earnings growth including bonuses went into reverse, dipping by 0.1 points to 2.5%, while earnings growth excluding bonuses dropped by a similar amount to 2.8%. A new monthly update on the UK\u2019s GDP by the Office for National Statistics found the economy was running at a faster pace in May than the beginning of the year after a rise in average quarterly growth from 0.1% to 0.3%. More optimistically, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said the recovery could continue over the coming months, with a forecast for growth reaching 0.4% in the three months to June, giving a boost to MPC members keen to increase rates.",

The international sales event, which covered the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, caused chaos as customers fought to get their hands on cut-price bears and supplies ran out. \u201cIt was beyond anything we could have ever imagined,\u201d Price John told NBC. \u201cThere was really no way for us to have estimated those crowds. We were fully stocked, fully staffed.\u201d The company will offer US, UK and Canadian customers a $15 voucher through 31 August and will still honor its pay-your-age promotion in stores for children during the child\u2019s birthday month, she said. Police were called in the UK after stores were closed, unable to keep up with demand and facing angry customers, some of whom had waited up to nine hours. The Build-a-Bear stores across the US also had to shut up shop early. People started lining up at 6am for the sale at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, according to the Star Tribune. The company tweeted that the promotion was being suspended just hours later because of safety concerns.",

      "bodyText": "Gareth Southgate\u2019s success in quietly transforming the England football team from plucky young underdogs into national heroes has not gone unnoticed in the boardrooms of corporate Britain. While Southgate and the team are still training for the third-place play-off in St Petersburg on Saturday, agents have been fending off calls from banks and other big businesses asking him to share management and motivational advice with them in after-dinner speeches. \u201cThere is huge demand for Gareth,\u201d Chris Banks, of the celebrity booking agency NMP Live, said. \u201cPeople want to talk to him about leadership and how to change the culture of an organisation. It\u2019s not just banks but all sorts from across the corporate sector.\u201d He said Southgate, 47, could secure as much as \u00a3100,000 for short after-dinner speeches or moderating panel discussions as he is \u201cvery much the man of the moment\u201d. Banks said NMP has not passed on any of the appearance requests it has received on to Southgate as \u201che clearly has more important things to be getting on with right now\u201d. However, when the euphoria passes NMP will pass a dossier to Southgate for his consideration. \u201cGareth doesn\u2019t have set rates like those lower down the chain; when it comes to his fee a lot of factors will come into consideration, such as his schedule and the nature of the request and who the client is,\u201d Banks said. \u201cBut demand at the moment is very high and if a client wants him they would have to put in a very high offer to secure him as he will have very limited time. He will be commanding tens of thousands of pounds if not a hundred thousand.\u201d Publishers are also chasing Southgate, Harry Kane, Kieran Trippier and the rest of the team to write books revealing the inside story of their World Cup success. Adrian Sington, the managing director of the talent agency Kruger Cowne Rights, said he expected competition among publishers would be intense and agents will hold auctions to secure the best-paying deals. \u201cSouthgate\u2019s book would be the most in demand, and the most interesting,\u201d Sington said. \u201cThere are lessons to be learned from Southgate that go beyond football \u2013 for business, leadership and mentoring. As a punter I would definitely buy it.\u201d He said publishers would also be interested in securing Kane, Trippier and Harry Maguire but they would offered substantially less money than Southgate. Sington declined to speculate on potential fees but said offers would be far less than the \u00a35m five-book deal Wayne Rooney signed with HarperCollins in 2006. The publisher shelved the contract last year after Rooney\u2019s first two books My Story So Far (2006) and My Decade in the Premier League (2012) failed to fly off the shelves. Instea, Rooney will publish one last book when he hangs up his boots. \u201cThe days of the blockbuster sports book are largely over as fans are so much closer to players instantly via social media,\u201d Sington said. \u201cBut offers will be made to all the key players and I\u2019d expect them to be in the next days and weeks, not weeks and months.\u201d Offers will be made to players\u2019 agents who will set a floor price to gain entry to an auction in which they bid against each other, Sington said. Jamie Vardy secured \u00a3250,000 for his book telling the story of Leicester City\u2019s shock Premier League title triumph in 2016 after four publishers competed for his rights in auction. Steve Martin, the chief executive of M&amp;C Saatchi Sport &amp; Entertainment, a sponsorship and marketing agency, also said he expected Southgate to attract the most interest from sponsors because he has \u201cthe most aspirational story to tell\u201d. He said: \u201cSouthgate can talk about how to lead, how to change and how to build success. What I like about Southgate is that he is humble and he is able to say when things have gone wrong. From a brand perspective there is a lot with him that you want to be associated with.\u201d Martin said he also expected Kane, Trippier and Maguire to receive a good amount of brand and sponsorship requests. He said Maguire\u2019s jokey personality on Twitter had shown \u201can architecture that brands can work with\u201d. However, Martin said it would be the FA who will be \u201crubbing their hands in glee\u201d the most as this World Cup performance has \u201cshown the importance of England as a team and not a collection of individuals, which had been the main weakness\u201d. He added: \u201cThe FA\u2019s commercial team will be sitting there really excited to got out to sponsors and brands as they now have a vision and story to engage fans with.\u201d Mark Borkowski, a PR and branding expert, said the team\u2019s humble and understated approach would draw many big brands back to football. \u201cBefore the World Cup some brands had gone off football because of some of the more colourful behaviour of players and the scandal at Fifa,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Southgate\u2019s phlegmatic and humble approach could mean that this could be the start of a new generation of players that brands want to go all in on.\u201d England\u2019s world cup winners Gareth Southgate Set to be the biggest financial winner from the World Cup, with publishers keen to secure the rights to books telling the inside story of the tournament as well as his insights into management and motivation. Southgate is also in high demand for after-dinner speaking. Harry Kane As captain, Kane\u2019s publishing rights will be hotly contested. Kane already stars in Nike\u2019s \u201cNothing beats a Londoner\u201d campaign alongside the grime star Skepta and the Olympic hero Mo Farah.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Administrators in charge of finding a buyer for the stricken Poundworld chain have announced a further 80 stores will close \u2013 at a cost of more than 1,000 jobs. The second wave of closures adds to 25 announced earlier this week, which will result in 242 staff at the chain being made redundant this weekend. Poundworld collapsed into administration last month after rescue talks with potential buyers failed, sparking fears for the jobs of its 5,000 staff at 335 shops. Deloitte, the accountancy firm acting as Poundworld\u2019s administrator, said the latest closures will not affect the potential sale of the remaining shops and that discussions with interested parties were ongoing. The joint administrator Clare Boardman said: \u201cWhile we remain hopeful that a sale for part, or parts, of the business can still happen, it has not been possible to sell the business as a whole. \u201cWe would like to thank all the employees for their continued support and commitment during this difficult time. We are keeping staff appraised of developments as they happen.\u201d Poundworld\u2019s founder Chris Edwards has previously criticised Deloitte for turning down an offer to buy the business back. He said the deal would have saved 3,000 jobs at the chain. He said: \u201cThe amount of extra money the administrator is holding out for is a drop in the ocean when you consider how much money will be needed to stabilise the business and replenish stock levels, which is where the real costs will be incurred, and that\u2019s why we can\u2019t increase our offer. \u201cI now believe the business will close rather than jobs being saved.\u201d Deloitte said Poundworld had struggled in an increasingly competitive market for discount goods but also blamed \u201chigh product-cost inflation, decreasing footfall [and] weaker consumer confidence\u201d. Its demise echoed similar business failures of high street names this year, including the electronics firm Maplin and Toys R Us.

      "bodyText": "Markets are ending the week on a - marginally - positive note. Earlier this week, news of further tariffs to be imposed by the US on Chinese imports had left shares floundering, but there was a minor recovery today, mainly due to the lack of any further developments. But the pound wobbled after President Trump told the Sun that there would be no US-UK trade deal because of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit policy. Sterling came off its worst levels as the president seemed to backtrack slightly at this afternoon\u2019s press conference with the UK prime minister. It is currently down 0.2% at $1.3171, having earlier fallen as low as $1.3104. The weaker pound has helped support the FTSE 100, with its large number of overseas earners. The UK index is up 0.22% at 7668, while Germany\u2019s Dax has risen 0.48% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.44%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now virtually flat. Earlier China reported a record trade surplus with the US, which will not help dissuade Trump from his current trade policy. And Bank of England deputy governor John Cunliffe cautioned against raising UK interest rates too quickly. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. The lack of any new trade tensions between the US and China is giving some support to Wall Street, but mixed results from three big banks have limited the gains. JP Morgan Chase beat expectations, but Wells Fargo disappointed and Citigroup shares were under pressure despite the bank reporting better than forecast profits. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 20 points or 0.06%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.05%. The Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.05%. The pound has recovered some ground as President Trump and Theresa May give their joint press conference, with Trump seeming to backtrack on the \u201cno-trade deal\u201d rhetoric of earlier. Sterling, having fallen as low as $1.3104 against the dollar, is now down 0.3% at $1.3162. Goldman Sachs economists have said there is a 60% chance that the US would go ahead with the extra $200bn tariffs on Chinese goods announced this week. They said: While very uncertain, we would expect the tariffs could be imposed as soon as late September but possibly not until after the election. (The mid-term elections take place in November.) Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe said there was a case for caution in raising interest rates. Speaking in Kendal, he quoted advice given in 1999 by US economist Alan Blinder, who said: \u201cIn my view both as a citizen and as a policymaker, a little stodginess at the central bank is entirely appropriate.\u201d Cunliffe, who voted against the Bank\u2019s last rate rise in November said the UK economy appeared to be growing as fast as predicted in May, but wages did not seem to be growing at the expected 3% annual rate. He concluded: Looking to the medium term, there remains a case for a little \u2018stodginess\u2019 yet. JP Morgan Chase has turned in better than expected results, as Wall Street\u2019s earning season kicks off. The bank reported second quarter income of $8.32bn, up from $7.03bn this time last year, helped by higher than forecast trading revenue and increased demand for loans. Cuts in corporate tax rates and a growing economy has driven demand from borrowers, while the bank\u2019s trading business benefited from increased volatility thanks to the current trade tensions. Chief executive Jamie Dimon said: We see good global economic growth, particularly in the US where consumer and business sentiment is high. Wall Street is expected to open marginally lower after Thursday\u2019s gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed up 224 points or 0.9%, is forecast to dip by around 10 points at the open, according to IG. President Trump has said the relationship between the US and the UK is \u201cvery, very strong\u201d - despite his earlier comments to the Sun. Speaking to reporters at Chequers ahead of talks with Theresa May, he said they would be talking about trade among other things. But given he seemed to rule out a trade deal between the two countries because of May\u2019s Brexit strategy, it remains to be seen how this turns out. The pound does not seem convinced, still down 0.6% against the dollar. More on the record Chinese trade surplus with the US. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, said: Trade remains one of the key topics for investors at present, with China announcing a record surplus with the US for the month of June. In Trump\u2019s simplistic view of trade, the president views a deficit as a loss to the US, and therefore he will clearly be unhappy with the record high $29B shown against China for last month. The recently announced tariffs should see this fall in the present month, but it is unlikely to contribute to a major decline immediately with the tariffs themselves still only representing a fairly small portion of overall trade. Another development that will likely attract the ire of Trump is the ongoing depreciation of the Chinese yuan, which is on course for its fifth consecutive week of losses against the US dollar - its longest weekly losing streak in two years. Here\u2019s more apparent fallout from the trade tensions between the US and China, courtesy of Reuters: A hotel in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen on Friday denied a report that it would charge U.S. guests an extra 25 percent amid an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing. However, three staff members who declined to be identified told Reuters that a discriminatory rate policy had indeed been posted at the hotel as of Thursday but had since been removed. The Global Times, a hawkish tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily, said in a report dated Thursday that the Modern Classic Hotel Group had put up a notice at its hotel informing guests of the extra charge. It cited a spokesperson at the hotel, surnamed Yang, saying that the hotel had posted the notice last Friday. \u201cWe have no idea where this news came from. My phone has been ringing off the hook all day today,\u201d Bai Lulu, a front office manager, told Reuters at the hotel. \u201cWe treat all our guests equally. We wouldn*t charge one type of guest more than another type of guest,\u201d Bai said, adding that the hotel did not currently have any American guests. However, another staff member, declining to be identified, said there had indeed been notices saying Americans would be charged extra. \u201cThere were ads up yesterday in the restaurant stating Americans would be charged 25 percent extra. We took photos.\u201d The Global Times had cited a spokesperson for the hotel surnamed Yang as saying their boss was \u201creally angry about the endless tariffs the U.S. planned to impose on China\u201d. The pound continues to slip against the dollar as investors weigh up Donald Trump\u2019s inflammatory comments about Theresa May\u2019s Brexit proposals meaning no UK-US trade deal. It is currently down 0.64% at $1.3119, after hitting a low for the week of $1.3117. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: US President Trump has put his counterpart Teresa May in a difficult position this morning saying that a soft Brexit would mean no trade deal between the UK and US. This comes a day after May released a white paper on the UK-Europe relationship after Brexit, offering a softer stance ahead of next week\u2019s vote on a Brexit trade bill. The UK can\u2019t afford to alienate either the US or the EU, its two largest foreign trade partners, and will not be able to choose an \u201ceither-or\u201d solution. Trump\u2019s comments come at a particularly bad time for May who is facing bigger problems as her government is in a precarious balance after the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson earlier this week. The pound dropped 0.6% against the dollar following Trump\u2019s remarks. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: For the second day in a row the markets ignored Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive posturing to rebound, climbing back towards the levels abandoned at the start of the week. Not that there wasn\u2019t at least one casualty of the President\u2019s big mouth... The FTSE led the way after the bell, the UK index adding another 60 points to re-cross 7700. That\u2019s put the FTSE back in the ballpark of Monday and Tuesday\u2019s 3 and a half week highs, showing the extent to which investors are trying to ignore the ongoing trade war between the US and China unless they specifically have a new threat to deal with. The pound, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t help but pay attention to the President... Trump claimed that Theresa May\u2019s current Brexit plan \u2018will probably kill\u2019 any potential US trade deal, a comment that not only undermines the Prime Minister at the end of an already challenging week, but one that understandably sent sterling sharply lower. Against the dollar the pound fell 0.6%, forcing cable under $1.315 and to its worst price since the start of the month, while it also trickled 0.2% lower against the euro, where it slipped to \u20ac1.129. Not that the euro was looking too good against the greenback, the single currency slumping 0.4% to hits its own 2 week nadir. This allowed the Eurozone indices to do the same as the FTSE, with the DAX and CAC rising 0.6% and 0.5% respectively. Only three fallers in the FTSE 100: Randgold Resources as the gold price dips, credit specialist Experian following a trading update and Sky, as investors take some profits after Thursday\u2019s rise on the back of the bid battle between Rupert Murdoch and Comcast for the satellite broadcaster. As expected, investors continue to push the markets higher as European trading begins. The FTSE 100 is up 0.68% at 7704, Germany\u2019s Dax has risen 0.45% , France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.41% while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is 0.43% better. Michael van Dulken at Accendo Markets said the Chinese trade figures were a double edged sword: [They are] supportive of global growth but backing up Trump\u2019s trade grievances. More on China\u2019s trade figures, and more fuel for Donald Trump\u2019s dispute with the country. The latest figures show a record trade surplus with the US as Chinese exporters rushed to sell goods to America ahead of the imposition of Trump\u2019s tariffs. Reuters reports: China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States swelled to a record in June as its overall exports remained solid, a result that could further inflame a bitter trade dispute with Washington. The data came after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump raised the stakes in its trade row with China on Tuesday, saying it would slap 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including numerous consumer items. China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States, which is at the centre of the tariff tussle, widened to a record monthly high of $28.97 billion, up from $24.58 billion in May, according to Reuters calculations based on official data going back to 2008. Trump, who has demanded Beijing cut the trade surplus, could use the latest result to further ratchet up pressure on China after both sides last week imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on $34 billion of each other\u2019s goods. Washington has warned it may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods - nearly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year. The dispute has jolted global financial markets, raising worries a full-scale trade war could derail the world economy. Chinese stocks fell into bear market territory and the yuan currency has skidded, though there have been signs in recent days its central bank is moving to slow the currency\u2019s declines. China\u2019s June exports rose 11.3 percent from a year earlier, China General Administration of Customs reported, beating forecasts for a 10 percent increase according to the latest Reuters poll of 39 analysts, and down from a 12.6 percent gain in May. China\u2019s commerce ministry confirmed last month that Chinese exporters were front-loading exports to the U.S. to get ahead of expected tariffs - a situation that could exacerbate any slowdown in shipments toward the year-end. \u201cLooking ahead, export growth will cool in the coming months as US tariffs start to bite alongside a broader softening in global demand,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics in Singapore wrote in a note, though he noted a weaker yuan should help offset some of the decline. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With Donald Trump focussed on the Nato budget, Brexit and bigging up Boris Johnson, investors have managed to put fears of an escalating trade war behind them for the moment. Following a slump earlier in the week as Trump threatened to slap tariffs on another $200bn worth of Chinese imports to the US - ranging from human hair to sculptures - markets have managed to regain their composure. With no new developments since then - although China has yet to spell out how it will, inevitably, retaliate - the positive mood is set to continue when traders begin work this morning. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The absence of harsh words from the US and China encouraged traders to step into the market and snap up stocks. Investors are getting used to the pattern, whereby equity markets can recover after a big sell-off that was triggered on account of trade tensions. In keeping with recent trends, the US indices held up better than their European counterparts. The S&amp;P 500 hit its highest level since early March and the NASDAQ 100 hit an all-time high. Dealers believe the US is in a stronger position to weather the storm than the rest of the world, and that is why the US equity benchmarks are outperforming. Steven Mnuchin, the US secretary of the Treasury, revealed that many of the trade talks with China have broken down, however, he confirmed that China is very important in cooperation with North Korea. These remarks suggest the US doesn\u2019t want to be too aggressive with Beijing, which is also giving investors hope. Wall Street closed up 0.9% and the Nikkei 225 has gained more than 1.9%, so Europe is forecast to open higher: China released trade figures overnight showing stronger than expected exports, up 11.3% compared to estimates of a 10% increase. Imports rose by 14.1% compared to forecasts of a 20.8% increase. None of this is likely to deter Trump from his view of unfair trade practices from China. CMC\u2019s Madden said: It is impressive that exports topped forecasts given that US tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium kicked in last month. The massive trade surplus that China has with the US is one of the reasons that President Trump instigated the trade spat, and dealers will be keeping an eye on developments. Elsewhere the pound is down following Trump\u2019s comments that prime minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan may mean no trade deal with the US. Against the dollar sterling is down 0.34% at $1.3160 while it has fallen 0.17% against the euro to \u20ac1.1292. The dip is likely to help the FTSE 100, which is packed with overseas earners which benefit from a weaker pound. Jasper Lawler, head of researh at London Capital Group, said: Trump\u2019s declaration that this softer version of Brexit would mean that a trade deal with the US was \u201cprobably\u201d off the table, was a blow to both host Theresa May and the pound, sending sterling tumbling overnight. Let\u2019s not forget that the hope of a quick trade deal with the US was a significant factor in Theresa May\u2019s decision to invite Trump in the first place. Another embarrassment that May could have done without. Trump\u2019s words of no deal have confirmed the fears of Brexiteers and will have stoked the fire in the hard Brexit camp, making Theresa May\u2019s future in charge look doubtful once more. This fear was reflected in the pound as it dropped sharply in late night trading. With no high impact UK economic data due for release today, pound traders will continue to watch political developments. Trump and May are expected to hold a joint press conference after lunch where they will both be pressed for trade comments. In the absence of any encouraging trade comments, gains in the pound going forward could be limited, and a meaningful move over $1.32 could be doubtful. There is little in the way of economic news elsewhere either to distract traders from the latest trade and Brexit developments. Follow Trump\u2019s day in our politics live blog:",

Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States swelled to a record in June as its overall exports remained solid, a result that could further inflame a bitter trade dispute with Washington.</p> <p>The data came after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump raised the stakes in its trade row with China on Tuesday, saying it would slap 10 percent tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including numerous consumer items. </p> <p>China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States, which is at the centre of the tariff tussle, widened to a record monthly high of $28.97 billion, up from $24.58 billion in May, according to Reuters calculations based on official data going back to 2008.</p> <p>Trump, who has demanded Beijing cut the trade surplus, could use the latest result to further ratchet up pressure on China after both sides last week imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on $34 billion of each other\u2019s goods. Washington has warned it may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods - nearly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.</p> <p>The dispute has jolted global financial markets, raising worries a full-scale trade war could derail the world economy.

Investors are getting used to the pattern, whereby equity markets can recover after a big sell-off that was triggered on account of trade tensions. In keeping with recent trends, the US indices held up better than their European counterparts. The S&amp;P 500 hit its highest level since early March and the NASDAQ 100 hit an all-time high.

CMC\u2019s Madden said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is impressive that exports topped forecasts given that US tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium kicked in last month.

Against the dollar sterling is down 0.34% at $1.3160 while it has fallen 0.17% against the euro to \u20ac1.1292. The dip is likely to help the FTSE 100, which is packed with overseas earners which benefit from a weaker pound. Jasper Lawler, head of researh at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trump\u2019s declaration that this softer version of Brexit would mean that a trade deal with the US was \u201cprobably\u201d off the table, was a blow to both host Theresa May and the pound, sending sterling tumbling overnight. Let\u2019s not forget that the hope of a quick trade deal with the US was a significant factor in Theresa May\u2019s decision to invite Trump in the first place. Another embarrassment that May could have done without.</p> <p> Trump\u2019s words of no deal have confirmed the fears of Brexiteers and will have stoked the fire in the hard Brexit camp, making Theresa May\u2019s future in charge look doubtful once more. This fear was reflected in the pound as it dropped sharply in late night trading. With no high impact UK economic data due for release today, pound traders will continue to watch political developments. Trump and May are expected to hold a joint press conference after lunch where they will both be pressed for trade comments. In the absence of any encouraging trade comments, gains in the pound going forward could be limited, and a meaningful move over $1.32 could be doubtful.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is little in the way of economic news elsewhere either to distract traders from the latest trade and Brexit developments.</p> <p>Follow Trump\u2019s day in our politics live blog:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jul/13/trump-trashes-mays-brexit-plans-and-hails-boris-johnson-as-future-pm-live\">Trump trashes May's Brexit plans and hails Boris Johnson as future PM - live</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-07-13T06:40:05.650Z\">at 7.40am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Lettuce is being flown in from the US, and imported from Spain and Poland as soaring temperatures increase demand but hit crops in the UK. The cargo carrier IAG Cargo said it had flown 30,000 heads of lettuce from Los Angeles to the UK in the past week alone. Tony Clemence, general manager of the Bristol branch of the wholesaler Total Produce, said the company was having to import about 30% of its iceberg lettuce and 40% of its celery from Spain and Poland when all supplies usually come from the UK at this time of year. \u201cWe\u2019re not importing from the US but people will look at that because they are committed to a quantity for the supermarkets. Spain is mainly growing for its local markets at this time of year, so there is not enough to go around and some will have to look further afield.\u201d Wholesale prices have soared by more than 30% as the recent heatwave has exacerbated problems that began when the \u2018beast from the east\u2019 period of cold and wet weather in March delayed planting. \u201cObviously there is increased demand because of the weather but the problem is more about supply,\u201d Clemence said. The British Leafy Salads Association said the UK crop of salad leaves was 75% of the usual yield at this time of year, while demand had increased by as much as 40% last week. High temperatures were affecting all farmers in the group\u2019s major salad-growing areas, from Fife and Lancashire to East Anglia and Sussex. Other crops, including celery, onions, carrots, broccoli and cauliflower, are also being affected by high temperatures, which stress the plants and halt growth. Some growers have also been hit by the lack of rain. Tim O\u2019Malley, the managing director of Nationwide Produce, said the group was expecting the onion yield to be down by as much as 30% and that vegetables would be smaller than usual. He said the daily wholesale price for carrots was 140% up on this time last year amid similar problems. \u201cWe had a cold, wet spring, which meant crops were planted late and often in cold and wet soil conditions. So the crops got off to a bad start and now they are suffering not just due to lack of rainfall but also heat. At temperatures above 27\u00b0C crops simply stop growing and now is the vital growing period. Irrigating crops is simply keeping them alive at these temperatures \u2013 alive but not growing. Crops without irrigation are dying,\u201d he said. So far, prices in supermarkets, which generally agree a contract price with farmers before the season, are not rising. Tough competition, particularly from the discounters Aldi and Lidl, is helping to limit the impact on shoppers but farmers, wholesalers, restaurants, cafes and smaller stores are likely to be hit by rises. O\u2019Malley said farmers were negotiating with supermarkets about increasing prices or changing size and weight specifications as they expect the hot weather to continue. The difficulties come as supplies of tenderstem broccoli, mange tout and sugar snap peas have been hit by heavy rainfall in Kenya that has destroyed thousands of hectares of crops. In its newsletter, Total Produce told clients there was \u201ccurrently no alternative country of origin available\u201d for tenderstem broccoli and that supplies of fine beans, mange tout and sugar snap peas were low and their quality \u201cintermittent\u201d.",

Mark Lanier, the lead counsel for the women, six of whom have died from ovarian cancer, said Johnson &amp; Johnson had covered up evidence of asbestos in its products for more than 40 years. After a six-week trial at a court in St Louis, a jury awarded the women $4.14bn in punitive damages and $550m in compensatory damages. Medical experts testified during the trial that asbestos, a known carcinogen, is mixed in with mineral talc, which is the primary ingredient in Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products. Lawyers said asbestos fibres and talc particles were found in the ovarian tissues of many of the women. \u201cWe hope this verdict will get the attention of the J&amp;J board and that it will lead them to better inform the medical community and the public about the connection between asbestos, talc and ovarian cancer,\u201d Lanier said. \u201cThe company should pull talc from the market before causing further anguish, harm and death from a terrible disease.\u201d Johnson &amp; Johnson has been sued by more than 9,000 women who claim its talcum powder contributed to their ovarian cancer. The company has consistently denied that its products can be linked to the disease. The company said it was deeply disappointed with the verdict, saying it was part of a \u201cfundamentally unfair process\u201d that grouped the women together and awarded them the same amount despite differences in their cases.

Johnson &amp; Johnson remains confident that its products do not contain asbestos and do not cause ovarian cancer,\u201d J&amp;J said in a statement. \u201cEvery verdict against Johnson &amp; Johnson in this court that has gone through the appeals process has been reversed and the multiple errors present in this trial were worse than those in the prior trials which have been reversed.\u201d The women\u2019s health charity Ovacome has a fact sheet on the issue.
