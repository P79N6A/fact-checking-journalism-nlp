      "bodyText": "If you sign up to the AA, the roadside recovery firm pledges to cover you and your motor for the next 12 months. But please note: the offer is only available to the firm's customers, not its chief executives. That became clear last month, when the self-proclaimed fourth emergency service eased out boss Chris Jansen just eight months after he'd joined the group \u2013 and only two months after the company floated on the stock market. He'd been hired by the AA's old private equity owners, who were preparing to sell the business. But in June the firm announced that Bob Mackenzie, a former boss of rival Green Flag, had gained the support of City investors to bring in his own team to run the business after listing. Cue a pile-up of platitudes about how Mackenzie and Jansen would share the driving \u2013 only for the latter to get left on the hard shoulder, where he's been reduced to attempting to thumb a lift from another company. \"I have agreed with Bob to find a new executive opportunity outside the AA,\" Jansen admitted, rather humiliatingly. All of which should get another run-out this week as the company unveils the first set of results since its flotation. So far investors have enjoyed the ride, with shares up about 18%, but Mackenzie now has nobody else to blame if the shares stop purring. Soaps and spray-ons keep investors happy In the 1870s, a pair of Georges \u2013 a Brit called Paterson and a Greek called Zochonis \u2013 were working together in a Sierra Leone trading company. They became pals and in 1879 set up a trading post of their own, Paterson Zochonis &amp; Company, which dealt with west African exports to Europe while also importing textiles and food to Sierra Leone. After many iterations, their company became what is the present-day PZ Cussons. And while even folk in the City pay little attention to what it's up to (despite its shares being listed on the London Stock Exchange for 61 years), you'll know its products. It plays an intimate role in the country's morning ablutions as the owner of Imperial Leather and Carex soaps and, as the company behind the St Tropez spray-on tan, no doubt supplies today's gorgeous Georges. But lesser known \u2013 although it will be mentioned in its trading statement this week \u2013 is how the company also tips its hat to its west African roots, with Nigeria accounting for a third of profits. As well as selling soap there, it now has Nigerian joint ventures in electricals and nutrition. Isn't that business scrubbing up nicely? No distraction from Braveheart's woes With impeccable timing, this week sees the annual general meeting of Braveheart Investment Group, an Aim-listed investor in early-stage businesses. Along with its name, its Perth base near Scone Abbey makes the company sound like just the type of entity you'd have expected to have been agitating for Scottish independence \u2013 but it turns out that its moniker is as misleading as the Mel Gibson film. In fact, Braveheart is about as British as these firms can be, having offices (and investments) in England and Northern Ireland as well as Scotland. Its boss, Geoffrey Thomson, hardly backed the yes campaign, telling the aptly named Alliance News in July that a yes vote would trigger \"capital flight immediately, falling property prices, an exodus to England and considerably higher taxes\", because \"if oil revenues are not as high as the Scottish National party says they will be, the only way to make up for that is by decreasing public expenditure or by raising taxes. And I think raising taxes is the easier option\". Still, the no vote does cause the company a minor irritation: investors attending the group's gathering this week might now want to talk about the firm's profits, which were down 92% last year.",
