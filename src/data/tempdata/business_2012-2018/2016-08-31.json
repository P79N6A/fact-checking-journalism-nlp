Now she has to find a way to deliver on her bold pledge. The prime minister would do well to consider a provocative paper published by her Tory colleague Chris Philp, a member of the Treasury select committee. Philp\u2019s big idea, published on Thursday, isn\u2019t original but there\u2019s no shame in that. The likes of Lord Myners, a City minister in the last Labour government, have banged on for years about the appeal of Swedish-style shareholder committees that would, in effect, replace nominations committees and recommend the appointment and removal of directors. Reformers have been right to think creatively because the rise of \u201cownerless corporations\u201d \u2013 companies in which the base of shareholders is so fragmented that the supposed owners behave as passive onlookers \u2013 is one reason why almost every governance reform of the past 30 years has disappointed. Unchecked boardroom greed is just one obvious example. The chief executive of the average FTSE 100 company can now expect to receive 150 times the income of the average worker, a gap that May was surely correct to call \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201cunhealthy\u201d in her pre-leadership speech in Birmingham. Nobody appears inclined to take responsibility, certainly not the usual crop of non-executives \u201cdrawn from the same narrow social and professional circles as the executive team\u201d, to use May\u2019s words again. Putting a committee of shareholder representatives in charge of proposing directors would not be a cure-all, or guarantee fresher thinking. But the odds ought to improve. Directors would have a keener sense of who they are really working for, and fund managers would have to take more responsibility for the makeup of the boardroom. A reformed set-up sounds a better model than the one Myners derides as producing non-executives \u201celected with North Korean-like majorities by uninterested shareholders, selected through a process led by the chairman which would also be familiar to those in Pyongyang\u201d. Shareholder committees would have two other roles. They would ratify pay packages and question strategy and performance. Again, both sound sensible prods to make fund managers wake up and take more responsibility for what is done in their clients\u2019 names. For good measure, Philp suggests adding an elected employee representative to the shareholder committee as a non-voting member (a nod to May?) though his prejudice against trade union reps is baffling. Many fund managers, one suspects, will be horrified by the idea that they could be asked to do more work and accept a few duties and responsibilities. One can hear the objections already: too much danger of becoming an insider; too costly; too time-consuming. Only the first complaint is serious since fund managers must still have the freedom to be able to sell an investment. But other European countries have been able to police similar systems without regular insider-trading scandals. As for time and cost, the fund management industry should remember what a splendid rake-off it collects from handling other people\u2019s money. Its fees are not supposed to be a free lunch. The fund manager Neil Woodford, an increasingly vocal critic of his industry\u2019s short-termism, thinks the proposals could help to cultivate \u201ca more appropriate and valuable form of corporate governance in the UK\u201d for the greater economic good. That\u2019s a significant endorsement and May should take the hint. Binding votes on pay and publication of pay ratios (two other ideas in Philp\u2019s paper) are fine as far as they go. But, if you really want to reform governance in the UK, go back to first principles: shareholders are meant to be active owners, not paper-shufflers. 888 Holdings bid for William Hill was never a runner Who\u2019s he trying to kid? Itai Frieberger, the chief executive of 888 Holdings, thinks a leak was one reason why his ambitious bid for William Hill, in partnership with Rank, never got off the ground. \u201cThe leak didn\u2019t allow us to have a conversation behind closed doors,\u201d says Frieberger. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the root causes of why we couldn\u2019t progress it. Before we could make a call to William Hill, it was all over the press. That is very unfortunate.\u201d Unfortunate, maybe, but ultimately irrelevant to the outcome. The 888/Rank proposal failed because the terms were too mean, the financing relied too heavily on debt and William Hill\u2019s board thought it could do better under its own steam, a reasonable judgment given the complexity of a three-way merger in a heavily regulated industry.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A Tory MP\u2019s proposals to rein in executive pay by allowing remuneration packages to be vetted by shareholder committees have won the backing of Britain\u2019s most influential fund manager. Chris Philp, the MP for Croydon South, is also calling for shareholders to have a binding vote on pay at annual general meetings in order to keep a check on awards that could be socially divisive and bad for business. Philp proposes forcing large companies to set up committees of their top five shareholders to approve pay deals before they go to the AGM. The committees would also recommend the appointment and removal of directors and question the board on strategy. The company chairman and an employee representative should take part in the meetings, giving workers a voice, though neither would have a vote, Philp recommends in a paper published on Thursday. He says the employee should not be a trade union official and should be elected by all the workers. Fund manager Neil Woodford has backed the proposals along with Lord Myners, the former City minister. Woodford, who has scrapped bonuses for his employees, said that instead of looking for short-term gains, shareholders should take responsibility for ensuring bosses act in the long-term interests of their companies and the wider economy. He said: \u201cRegrettably, this view and approach is not shared by many in the UK investment industry and I believe the problem is getting worse \u2026 The initiatives in this paper represent important steps towards cultivating a more appropriate and valuable form of corporate governance in the UK.\u201d Shareholders already vote on executive pay at AGMs but the vote is not binding. Under rules introduced in 2013, there is a binding vote on pay policy every three years, but this has had little or no impact on pay levels. The average FTSE 100 chief executive earns about \u00a36m a year \u2013 150 times the average worker\u2019s income, up from 70 times the average in 2002. There were big votes against some bosses\u2019 pay at AGMs this year, including the \u00a370m deal for Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP and a majority opposing Bob Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m at BP, but such revolts are still relatively rare and are usually led by the same few fund managers. Philp\u2019s proposals, published by the High Pay Centre campaign group, add to the ongoing debate about pay and governance. Theresa May promised in July to reform corporate governance to rebuild trust between voters and politicians in the wake of the Brexit vote. Philp, who backed May for Tory leader, will meet the prime minister\u2019s team next Tuesday to discuss his ideas. Philp said: \u201cShareholders are not engaged and are frankly being a bit lazy. They are not active, energetic custodians of their own capital. A symptom of that is out-of-control executive pay \u2013 not just high amounts but also lack of alignment between pay and performance.\u201d Philp said his proposals were based on rules in countries such as Switzerland, the Netherlands and Denmark, which have binding pay votes, and Sweden, where shareholder committees have increased investor involvement. He said fund managers were paid a lot of money and had the resources to put representatives on the committees. If they chose not to, their decision would be made public and the next biggest shareholder would be asked to attend, he said. Myners, a former chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer, said: \u201cChris Philp\u2019s proposals will not be universally welcomed by either company directors or fund managers because they challenge the existing order that has suited these two communities so well. But implementation of his programme would represent a transformational change in the democratisation and accountability of ownership.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is to be lobbied by MPs and fair pay campaigners after a petition against planned pay cuts gathered almost 90,000 signatures. Siobhain McDonagh MP, who raised the issue in parliament in June, will lead a delegation to present the Change.org petition at the retailer\u2019s Marble Arch store in London on Thursday. Friends and family of M&amp;S employees who are facing pay cuts will be supported by her fellow Labour MPs John Spellar, Carolyn Harris, Karen Buck and Nia Griffith as well as Change.org campaigners and student activists. Long-serving shop staff say they face pay cuts that could potentially cost thousands of pounds after M&amp;S removed premiums for working Sundays and antisocial hours, trimmed back bank holiday payments and changed pensions payments. The retailer said it was making the changes to help pay for a 15% increase in basic pay for its 69,000 workers from next April to \u00a38.50 an hour. McDonagh said: \u201cThe company is clearly aware of the reputational damage that it has faced as a result of the changes it plans. Loyal, longstanding staff have lost their morale after their years of loyal service, while M&amp;S customers are seriously disappointed by a company that they had always seen as well-respected bastions of moral values on the high street.\u201d In parliament McDonagh called on the government to close loopholes which made it possible for companies to make changes to staff benefits in order to offset the impact of the introduction of the legally binding \u201cnational living wage\u201d of \u00a37.20 an hour in April. A number of companies, including B&amp;Q, Tesco and Morrisons have raised basic pay only to cut perks and premium payments for weekend, holiday or late working. The Labour MP for Mitcham and Morden said some M&amp;S staff would lose up to \u00a32,000 a year as a result of the changes. \u201cThis is not just any pay cut. This is a big fat M&amp;S pay cut,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "Plans by mobile phone operators to block adverts for customers across their networks are in doubt after the EU said they breached net neutrality legislation. Updated guidelines issued by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (Berec) this week state that advertising should not be blocked by networks, something that mobile operator Three has already trialled in the UK. Net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers should treat all online content equally without blocking or slowing down specific websites on purpose, or allowing companies to pay for preferential treatment. The EU ruling could eliminate a looming threat to publishers who are already struggling with the commercial consequences of growing numbers of people using software to block ads on their PCs or smartphones. Berec\u2019s new guidelines say that providers \u201cshould not block, slow down, alter, restrict, interfere with, degrade or discriminate advertising \u2026 unless the conditions of the exceptions \u2026 are met in a specific case.\u201d It is the responsibility of UK regulator Ofcom to implement and interpret the guidelines. However, the UK government has previously indicated it is sympathetic to publisher complaints about ad blocking. In March, the then culture secretary John Whittingdale described ad blocking as a \u201cmodern-day protection racket\u201d. Three would not comment on the new guidelines but has argued that it does not fall foul of net neutrality rules because it offers consumers a choice about whether or not to block advertising. However, a response to consultation on the guidelines issued by Berec rules out that argument. It says: \u201cBerec does not consider that end-user consent enables ISPs to engage in such practices at the network level.\u201d The intervention by the European commission on behalf of publishers comes just days after reports of proposals to allow news organisations to charge search engines such as Google for using snippets from articles in search results. Germany\u2019s Axel Springer, one of Europe\u2019s most powerful media companies and publisher of the continent\u2019s largest tabloid, Bild, has been vocal in pushing for clampdowns on ad-blocking and greater regulation of the way Google and others use its content online. Three has not revealed the results of its 24-hour trial, and has not said when or if it plans to roll out an ad-blocking product for its customers. The company, which also operates in Italy, is using technology provided by Israeli company Shine, which already provides blocking across the Digicell network in Jamaica owned by Irish tycoon Denis O\u2019Brien. One of Shine\u2019s investors is Li Ka-shing, boss of Three parent company CK Hutchison and also a major investor in Facebook. Facebook itself is engaged in a battle with ad blockers, and earlier this month introduced technology to combat them. However, it has been suggested that the move \u2013 which has already been partially countered by ad-blocking software companies \u2013 could fall foul of EU privacy legislation.

      "bodyText": "A slide in the oil price following a bigger than expected rise in US crude inventories helped put European markets under pressure, although banking shares were boosted by a number of positive signs from the UK economy and talk of possible mergers following comments from the boss of Deutsche Bank. Investors were also cautious thanks to the continuing uncertainty about whether - or when - the US Federal Reserve might raise interest rates. Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers will be the key figures ahead of the next Fed meeting. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 39.28 points or 0.58% to 6781.51 but still managed a 0.85% gain on the month Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.61% to 10,592.69 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.43% to 4438.22 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 0.31% at 16,943.38 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.36% at 8716.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.31% to 577.39 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 108 points or 0.59%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Another successful Bank of England bond buying programme today as part of its quantitative easing operations: It received offers worth 3.19 times the number of bonds it wanted to buy. The slide in the oil price has dragged stock markets lower, with the commodity-heavy FTSE 100 now down around 30 points or 0.4%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Tumbling commodity prices have once more proven the undoing of the FTSE, with a late slide in crude prices adding to the woes of an index heavily weighted towards commodity companies. While some respite has been provided by the slowing rise of the US dollar, it is clearly not enough, with markets now looking towards the possibility of a 2016 rate hike which would drive the dollar sharply higher. Yet again it has been the weekly EIA oil figures that have sparked this market back into life. This week\u2019s rise of 2.3 million barrels was almost as large as the preceding week\u2019s increase in stockpiles, putting fresh downward pressure on crude oil and taking stock markets with it. The ghost of oversupply has not been laid to rest, indeed it seems to be returning with a vengeance. A rising US dollar and falling oil prices would potentially be a dangerous combination, threatening to unwind the gains made in equity markets over the summer. OPEC needs to do something, and quickly, but given their inability to reach a compromise, any action is still unlikely. OPEC and other producers are due to meet next month, with continuing uncertainty over whether they will be able to agree on measures to support the falling crude price. Oil prices have come under renewed pressure on further signs of falling demand and increased production. US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week according to the Energy Information Administration, up by 2.3m barrels compared with expectations of a 921,000 increase. Distillates - diesel and heating oil - rose unexpectedly, up by 1.5m barrels rather than showing a 157,000 drop. But gasoline stocks fell by 691,000 barrels although analysts had forecast a 1.2m decline. Meanwhile a Reuters survey shows that output from the OPEC oil producers rose by 40,000 barrels a day in August, with increases among Middle Eastern countries making up for losses from Africa. So Brent crude is not far from its lows of the day, down 1.9% at $47.43 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has fallen 1.7% at $45.52. The Apple tax receipts could help Ireland cut its goverment debt to around 85% of GDP, according to ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. But it said there was a danger the government\u2019s policy approach could be destabilised by the ruling, and its business model could be put to a legal test. But the US housing market is recovering to judge by the latest figures. The National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index rose 1.3% to 111.3 in July after two months of decline. This is the second highest reading in the last ten years. Lawrence Yun, the association\u2019s chief economist said: More home shoppers having success is good news for the housing market heading into the fall, but buyers still have few choices and little time before deciding to make an offer on a home available for sale. There\u2019s little doubt there\u2019d be more sales activity right now if there were more affordable listings on the market. More US data, and disappointing data at that. The latest Chicago manufacturing purchasing managers index has come in below expectations in August, after a strong performance in the previous two months. Back with the US jobs data, and economist James Smith at ING Bank says the ADP figures may not be much of a guide to Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers: The latest ADP payrolls estimate came in a touch above consensus at 177,000. The key thing to know about ADP\u2019s model is that is predominantly a function of last month\u2019s official employment data, which means that ADP\u2019s own up-to-date payrolls data plays only a minor role in generating the estimate. This means that the directional accuracy of ADP as a lead indicator of non-farm payrolls (ie higher or lower growth than last month) is around 50%. We are therefore none-the-wiser ahead of Friday\u2019s number, even if at face value, it supports the consensus call of 180,000. We expect job creation to fall short of expectations (ING forecast 150,000), following two months of remarkably strong non-farm payrolls. But... the FOMC would probably be content with such a figure, even if markets may view it as slightly disappointing. As the pool of available labour evaporates, job creation need only keep pace with increases in the overall size of the labour force. Some FOMC speakers have said that they would be comfortable with sub-150,000 non-farm payroll numbers, most notably Vice Chair Fischer who has indicated that 75-150 thousand would be acceptable. US markets are down in early trading: Dow Jones: -0.1% at 18,431 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,172 Nasdaq: -0.3% at 4,763 The Guardian\u2019s Rob Davies has been at a Ryanair press conference, where he found chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary in typically talkative form. O\u2019Leary was announcing the budget airline\u2019s new routes to Strasbourg and Faro, but commented on a number of subjects... 1. On Brexit, O\u2019Leary said he expects UK passenger numbers to be five million lower in the next financial year than they would otherwise have been. There\u2019s an awful lot of rubbish being talked over here about how there\u2019s been no effect. The effect is never going to be immediate. The UK is going to suffer some significant economic damage when they get into the entrails of the Brexit decision. We hope the UK does well out of it but I\u2019d be very concerned. The UK is going to end up looking pretty stupid. 2. On the EU\u2019s state aid ruling on Apple\u2019s tax affairs in Ireland: The Irish government shouldn\u2019t even appeal the decision. They should just write a letter to Europe and tell them politely to f**k off with themselves. Which is what they need to be told. 3. On new runways: (O\u2019Leary wants a new runway at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.) The way to finally deal with this is the government doing something intelligent for a change and saying you can all build a new runway, God speed. It\u2019s not in my interest to advocate three runways but it\u2019s what the UK needs to do. 4. On Theresa May: EasyJet and BA were invited for tea and muffins at...what\u2019s the country house? Chequers. We\u2019re the biggest airline in the UK and weren\u2019t invited. I\u2019d love to be invited to Chequers. I\u2019ve never been invited to Downing Street either. I wouldn\u2019t want to invite a peasant like me to either of those two august institutions. Being Irish, I\u2019d be trying to nick the silver or something else...though we shouldn\u2019t engage in national stereotypes, even if it is slagging off the Micks. US markets are expected to open lower: The private sector in the US created 177,000 jobs in August according to the monthly ADP report. It was lower than the 194,000 jobs added in July, but better than the 175,000 predicted by economists. The increase in August was largely driven by new jobs in the service industry: The ADP report comes before Friday\u2019s keenly awaited non-farm payrolls report. As the last report before the Fed\u2019s September policy meeting, investors will be scanning it for clues as to whether the next rate hike will come in September or later. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, says the ADP report suggests non-farm payrolls will show a gain of 188,000. If the ADP turns out to be off the mark and non-farm payrolls increase by 250,000 or more, as they did in both June and July, then a September rate hike would become a real possibility. It is more likely that payrolls will come in below 200,000, however, which would probably persuade the Fed to hold off on the next rate hike until December. Florian Hense, economist at Berbenberg, says low eurozone inflation of 0.2% in August is concerning for the European Central Bank: August, just like the first seven months, does not provide much evidence for a material shift in price dynamics. This remains an ongoing source of concern for the ECB. But whether today\u2019s numbers cause headache to the central bankers in Frankfurt remains to be seen. Whereas market-based gauges remained close to record lows, survey-based indicators had shown more resilience. Next week\u2019s governing council meeting (8 September) will unlikely bring big news. Mario Draghi will continue to stress that the ECB keeps all options open. There is some chance that the ECB will already announce an extension of asset purchases beyond the end of March 2017, but that is more likely to come in December when the ECB knows more about the Brexit impact and political risks in the US and Europe. Brent crude oil is now below $48 a barrel, down 1.3% at $47.76. The FTSE 100 is lagging other European markets for a second day as a drop in commodity prices weighs on mining shares. The biggest fallers: Meanwhile the banks are topping the table: European markets are mixed this afternoon, with the FTSE and the DAX lagging other major indices: FTSE 100: -0.03% at 6,819 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 10,650 France\u2019s CAC: +0.6% at 4,485 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 17,019 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1.1% at 8,778 Greece\u2019s ATG: +2.5% at 578 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 346 Over in the US, and despite a growing expectation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates later this year, one member believes low rates may be here for the long term. Chicago Federal Reserve president Charles Evans suggested in Beijing today that cheaper borrowing would remain because US economic growth had slowed so much it was almost a permanent expectation for business and investors, according to Reuters. However Evans is not a voting member this year, so here are the chances of a rise in the next few months: The EU has started \u201can economic war\u201d with the US by ordering Apple to pay Ireland up to \u20ac13bn plus interest in back taxes. That is the view of Jennifer McCloskey, the director of government affairs for the information technology industry council which lobbies on behalf of US tech industry. Conceding there were broader issues around business taxes to be addressed, she told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: We would encourage that folks return to the multilateral conversation around these issues, that we work together to find reasonable solutions, and that we stay away from actions that lead to what we see now which looks like we\u2019re starting some kind of economic war between the European Commission and the US government. The business community needs certainty and established rule of law - rules of engagement that we can rely on. And the direction of this departs extremely from all of that. We are concerned about the implications of this and what it could mean for future investment for our member companies\u2019 operations in Europe and around the globe. A company thinking about where they\u2019re going to invest the next dollar is going to think about things like this. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil is down 0.7% at $48.02. Oil analysts surveyed by Reuters revised down their price forecasts for the first time since February as an agreement to cut production among oil producing nations looked unlikely, and US stocks rose. The 34 analysts and economists said Brent would average $45.44 a barrel in 2016, slightly lower than last month\u2019s forecast of $45.51. Brent crude has averaged at $42.59 a barrel this year, hitting a near 13-year low of $27.10 in January and a high of $52.86 in June. Howard Archer at IHS Markit agrees that this morning\u2019s eurozone data will be disappointing for ECB president Mario Draghi and his colleagues on the governing council: Largely disappointing news for the ECB as eurozone consumer price inflation was disappointingly only stable at 0.2% in August. Adding to ECB concerns, there are signs that the eurozone labour market is faltering in reaction to recent slower growth and uncertainties over the outlook being magnified by the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU. It looks to be a very tight call as to whether or not the ECB acts on 8 September or decides to maintain a \u201cwait and see\u201d stance as to how the eurozone economy is performing \u2013 we marginally lean towards the \u201cwait and see\u201d view. If the ECB does undertake any further stimulus at its 8 September meeting, we believe it is most likely to extend its quantitative easing programme, which is currently due to continue \u201cuntil the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary.\u201d Stephen Brown, European economist at Capital Economics, says there a strong case for further action from the ECB following the weaker than expected inflation and unemployment data: The unchanged headline inflation rate in August highlights the fact that price pressures in the eurozone remain weak and boosts the case for more monetary easing from the ECB. The unemployment rate is well above its 1999 to 2007 average of 8.8%, indicating that there is a large amount of slack in the economy and suggesting that wage pressures will remain subdued. With Tuesday\u2019s survey data also pointing to a marked slowdown in growth ahead, there is a strong case for the ECB to announce further policy easing. This could come as soon as the Bank\u2019s meeting next week. Among the eurozone\u2019s 19 members, the jobless rate is highest in Greece at 23.5%, followed by 19.6% in Spain. The lowest rates were in Malta, at just 3.9%, and Germany at 4.2%. Youth unemployment remains a big problem, at 21.1% or just under three million people. In Greece, more than half of young people are out of work (50.3%), and the picture is also particularly bad in Spain (43.9%). Eurostat has also published unemployment figures for July. The jobless rate in the eurozone was unchanged at 10.1%, the lowest since July 2011. It had been expected to edge lower to 10%. The number of people out of work fell by 43,000 to 16.3m in July. Eurozone unemployment remains higher than in the wider European Union, where the jobless rate was unchanged at 8.6% in July. A breakdown of the eurozone inflation data shows that the core rate - stripping out energy and food which tend to be volatile - was also weaker than expected at 0.8% (unchanged). It was expected to pick up to 0.9%. Food inflation and service inflation slowed in August, while energy remained in deflation according to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate. The headline rate of inflation in the eurozone was unchanged at 0.2% in August. Economists had expected it to edge up to 0.3%. This is likely to strengthen speculation that the ECB could announce more stimulus for the sluggish eurozone economy when the governing council meets next week. More to follow... Consumer spending fell 0.2% in July, following a 0.8% fall in June. It took economists by surprise, with those polled by Reuters forecasting a 0.3% increase, and weighs on the outlook for French economy in the third quarter. Inflation in France was unchanged in August at 0.4%. The flash eurozone inflation data for August is coming up at 10am. More upbeat news from Germany. Unemployment in Europe\u2019s largest economy fell more than expected in August according to figures from the Federal Labour Office. The seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 7,000 to 2.675 million. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a smaller fall of 5,000. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.1%, the lowest since German reunification in 1990. Frank-Juergen Weise, head of Germany\u2019s labour office, said: Demand for labour, measured by employment and registered vacancies, continues to be high. Despite this morning\u2019s better-than-expected German data (on unemployment and monthly retail sales), the DAX is lagging other European indices, down 0.1% at 10,650. Over in Germany, consumers were more willing than expected to spend money in July. Retail sales increased by 1.7% on the month, following a 0.6% fall in June. Economists had predicted a more modest rise of 0.3%. But the data from the Federal Statistics Office was mixed, showing an unexpected fall in annual retail sales. The 1.5% drop in July followed a 2.3% increase in the annual rate in June. Economists had forecast a 0.3%. German retail sales data are considered erratic and are frequently revised, but the disappointing annual number will dampen hopes that consumer spending will be a significant boost to growth. The stronger than expected consumer confidence and house prices data is helping to push the pound higher this morning. Sterling is up 0.2% against the dollar at $1.3101. It is up 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1765. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, says the next big test for the pound against the dollar will come on Friday, when the US non-farm jobs report is published: Sterling remains strong on the back of positive data from the economy. The next major change in direction we could see in GBPUSD may come ahead of non-farm payrolls on Friday with downside risk still strong for the pair as dollar strength persists. House prices increased 0.6% in August according to the lender Nationwide. The average price of a home in the UK was \u00a3206,145. The rise took economists by surprise, with the City forecasting a 0.3% drop in prices. It was the strongest rate of monthly growth in five months, and followed a 0.5% rise in July. It drove the annual rate of growth in house prices to 5.6% in August from 5.2% in July. Despite the rise in prices, Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said the housing market had weakened since the Brexit vote. Prices were being supported as weak supply matched weak demand, he said: The pick up in price growth is somewhat at odds with signs that housing market activity has slowed in recent months. New buyer enquiries have softened as a result of the introduction of additional stamp duty on second homes in April and the uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum. However, the decline in demand appears to have been matched by weakness on the supply side of the market. This helps to explain why the pace of house price growth has remained broadly stable. What happens next on the demand side will be determined, to a large extent, by the outlook for the labour market and confidence amongst prospective buyers. European markets are down this morning but there are no major moves. The biggest faller is the DAX in Germany, where retail sales data were mixed (more coming up). Traders are a bit more subdued this morning after European equities hit a two-week high on Tuesday (the FTSE lagged). This is how it\u2019s looking: FTSE 100: -0.01% at 6,820 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.3% at 10,625 French CAC: -0.1% at 4,453 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.1% at 16,915 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.2% at 8,702 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.03% at 345 Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics is not convinced by the uptick in consumer confidence in August. He says confidence remains low following the Brexit vote, and is likely to weaken further in the coming months. The only partial recovery of GfK\u2019s composite index in August, after the sharpest month-to-month fall in 26 years in July, shows that consumer sentiment has been dealt a lasting blow by the EU referendum. The composite index remains much lower than its average of zero in the first six months of 2016. The looming real income squeeze, as inflation picks up and job growth moderates, likely will weigh on consumer sentiment over the next six months and lead to a sharp slowdown in household spending growth. Consumer confidence rebounded in August, as the jitters apparent in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote appeared to fade away. The headline index on the GfK consumer confidence index increased to -7 from -12 in July. All measures, including the outlook for personal finances, the economic outlook, and appetite for making major purchases, picked up this month. The survey of 2,000 individuals was slightly better than the -8 economists had expected. It suggested a revival in spirits among UK consumers after a one-off poll following the 23 June EU referendum showed the biggest slide in consumer confidence for 21 years. GfK\u2019s Joe Staton explains why consumers are feeling more cheery this month: We\u2019re reporting some recovery in the index this month as consumers settle into the new wait-and-see reality of a post-Brexit, pre-exit UK. The uptick in confidence is driven by good news from hard data, the combination of historic low interest rates matched with falling prices and high levels of employment. European markets are expected to open down this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The flash estimate of eurozone inflation for August will offer some clues on the challenges facing the region\u2019s central bankers as they return from their summer break. The European Central Bank will meet next week and speculation is building that its governing council led by Mario Draghi will announce more stimulus for the sluggish eurozone economy. The headline annual inflation rate is expected to show a slight pick-up to 0.3% from 0.2% in July. But a slight rise in inflation is unlikely to put a stop to talk of more stimulus. Price pressure in the single currency bloc remains weak, and consumer confidence has faltered following the Brexit vote. Also coming up today we have eurozone unemployment data and the ADP employment report in the US. We will also bring you more reaction to the EU\u2019s demands that Apple repay Ireland up to \u20ac13bn in illegal state aid. Please keep the comments coming.",

The key thing to know about ADP\u2019s model is that is predominantly a function of last month\u2019s official employment data, which means that ADP\u2019s own up-to-date payrolls data plays only a minor role in generating the estimate. This means that the directional accuracy of ADP as a lead indicator of non-farm payrolls (ie higher or lower growth than last month) is around 50%. We are therefore none-the-wiser ahead of Friday\u2019s number, even if at face value, it supports the consensus call of 180,000.</p> <p>We expect job creation to fall short of expectations (ING forecast 150,000), following two months of remarkably strong non-farm payrolls. But... the FOMC would probably be content with such a figure, even if markets may view it as slightly disappointing. As the pool of available labour evaporates, job creation need only keep pace with increases in the overall size of the labour force. Some FOMC speakers have said that they would be comfortable with sub-150,000 non-farm payroll numbers, most notably Vice Chair Fischer who has indicated that 75-150 thousand would be acceptable.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c6dff8e4b0df5f040dbfd8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T13:52:37.971Z\">2.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets are down in early trading:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Dow Jones: -0.1% at 18,431</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,172</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Nasdaq: -0.3% at 4,763</strong></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c6d9f6e4b04fe839bc522f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-31T13:39:43.830Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ryanair's O'Leary: Ireland should tell EU to f**k off over Apple</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e77b46ea0378b96a194bb6fbe90b32e87e54719b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e77b46ea0378b96a194bb6fbe90b32e87e54719b/0_136_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael O\u2019Leary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael O\u2019Leary</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The Guardian\u2019s Rob Davies has been at a Ryanair press conference, where he found chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary in typically talkative form.</strong></p> <p>O\u2019Leary was announcing the budget airline\u2019s new routes to Strasbourg and Faro, but commented on a number of subjects...</p> <p><strong>1.

markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>The <strong>flash estimate of eurozone inflation for August</strong> will offer some clues on the challenges facing the region\u2019s central bankers as they return from their summer break.</p> <p>The <strong>European Central Bank</strong> will meet next week and speculation is building that its governing council led by <strong>Mario Draghi </strong>will announce more stimulus for the sluggish eurozone economy.</p> <p>The headline annual inflation rate is expected to show a slight pick-up to 0.3% from 0.2% in July.</p> <p>But a slight rise in inflation is unlikely to put a stop to talk of more stimulus. Price pressure in the single currency bloc remains weak, and consumer confidence has faltered following the Brexit vote. </p> <p>Also coming up today we have <strong>eurozone unemployment data</strong> and the <strong>ADP employment report</strong> in the US. </p> <p><strong>We will also bring you more reaction to the EU\u2019s demands that Apple repay Ireland up to \u20ac13bn in illegal state aid. Please keep the comments coming.</strong><br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Michael O\u2019Leary expects Ryanair to carry 5 million fewer passengers to and from the UK next year due to the Brexit vote. Speaking as Ryanair launched new routes to Strasbourg in France and the Algarve, the airline\u2019s chief executive said he expected the referendum decision to put the brakes on the firm\u2019s UK passenger growth. UK traffic growth is set to slow from 15% this year to 6% next year, but would have increased by a \u201cdouble digit\u201d amount if the country had voted to remain in the EU, said O\u2019Leary, who campaigned against Britain severing links with Brussels. That means UK passenger numbers are set to be 44.5 million next year, when they \u201cwould have been closer to 50 million\u201d, as the carrier bases new planes in countries such as Germany and Poland instead of Britain. He said Ryanair could offset the UK decline with growth elsewhere on the continent and cost savings but warned that \u201cif there\u2019s a material further decline in pricing then profits will get hit\u201d. O\u2019Leary said that while Brexit might mean cheaper fares for UK customers in the short term, as airlines cut prices to maintain passenger numbers, the economy would suffer in the long run. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a bunch of halfwits out here going: \u2018Great, fares are getting cheaper,\u2019 but as fares get cheaper more aircraft will be moved away from the UK in the next two or three years.\u201d Ryanair has already said it will divert 10 aircraft that were destined for use in the UK to alternative bases. \u201cYou\u2019ll see property decisions, investment decisions in London being postponed. Inward investment into the UK is being postponed. \u201cThe UK is going to suffer some significant economic damage when they get into the entrails of the Brexit decision. We hope the UK does well out of it, but I\u2019d be very concerned.\u201d He said Britain would not gain greater control over its borders because the EU would not permit access to the single market without allowing freedom of movement. \u201cThe UK will end up looking pretty stupid,\u201d he said. The Irishman reiterated previous calls for the UK to build new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, rather than choosing between the first two. \u201cAll it\u2019s going to do is allow Heathrow or Gatwick to raise prices severely. If I was being selfish, it would suit us to see them double the charges to airlines. \u201cThey [the airlines] would be forced to put up prices and I\u2019ll still be at Stansted, which will still be the cheapest of three London airports. My prices will rise and I\u2019ll make more money. It\u2019s not in my interest to advocate three runways, but it\u2019s what the UK needs to do.\u201d O\u2019Leary said Ryanair was not asked to join talks between airline bosses and the prime minister at Chequers, despite being the largest airline serving the UK. \u201cEasyJet and BA were invited for tea and muffins at \u2026 what\u2019s the country house? Chequers. I\u2019ve never been invited to Downing Street either. I wouldn\u2019t want to invite a peasant like me to either of those two august institutions. \u201cBeing Irish, I\u2019d be trying to nick the silver or something else \u2026 though we shouldn\u2019t engage in national stereotypes, even if it is slagging off the Micks.\u201d O\u2019Leary\u2019s characteristic outbursts came despite him professing to be \u201csoft, cuddly and much-beloved\u201d as part of an image change.",

      "bodyText": "The accountancy watchdog has dropped an investigation into the former Tesco chief financial officer Laurie McIlwee, nearly two years after an accounting scandal emerged at the supermarket. McIlwee left his job at Tesco in April 2014 with a \u00a31m payoff following tensions with the then chief executive, Philip Clarke. Five months later, Clarke\u2019s successor, Dave Lewis, flagged up the discovery of a black hole in the company\u2019s accounts that was eventually valued at \u00a3263m. In December 2014, the Financial Reporting Council, the accountancy watchdog, launched an investigation into the actions of Tesco\u2019s financial team, including McIlwee, and the role of its auditor, PwC, in the profits overstatement. On Wednesday, the FRC said it had closed the investigation into McIlwee after concluding that there was \u201cno realistic prospect that a tribunal would make an adverse finding in relation to [his] conduct\u201d. PwC remains under investigation. The scandal is also being looked at by the Serious Fraud Office, which interviewed Clarke under caution last year. It is understood that McIlwee has been interviewed by the SFO, but only as a witness, and he is not being considered for prosecution. The FRC clearance means that McIlwee, who has not been in full-time work since leaving Tesco, is unlikely to face any action over the scandal and can look for a new role. The move also suggests that the SFO may be preparing to release the findings of its investigation. A third investigation by the grocery market watchdog in January led to Tesco being ordered to make \u201csignificant changes\u201d in the way it deals with suppliers, after finding that the supermarket, Britain\u2019s biggest, had deliberately delayed payments to maximise profits. The accounting scandal was revealed weeks after the arrival of Lewis, who was brought in to turn around falling sales and profits. McIlwee was paid \u00a3400,000 in the six months after he quit Tesco, during which time he was requested to be available to assist the supermarket. It later emerged that McIlwee did not provide any services to Tesco during that time and was asked not to come into the office. In McIlwee\u2019s absence, Clarke assembled a team of senior finance personnel to oversee monetary matters. When a whistleblower alerted Lewis to a problem with Tesco\u2019s accounts, a team of forensic accountants from Deloitte took over and established that the company had artificially inflated an estimate of first-half profits given to the City in August 2014. They found that similar practices had been in place during previous reporting periods, taking the total to \u00a3263m. In April, Tesco said it had found another \u00a360m in mis-statements from previous years, mostly as a result of an audit of its Irish operations. Deloitte said \u00a3118m of the \u00a3263m figure related to the first six months of the financial year and \u00a3145m related to previous years.",

      "bodyText": "PricewaterhouseCoopers has been fined \u00a32.3m by the accountancy watchdog over its auditing of the subprime lender Cattles and its biggest division, Welcome Financial Services, in 2007. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) also issued the accountancy firm with a severe reprimand. The fine was reduced from \u00a33.5m after mitigation and a settlement discount. In addition, PwC has to pay \u00a3750,000 towards the FRC\u2019s costs. The FRC said the \u00a33.5m original fine would have been the largest ever. In early 2015, Deloitte was fined \u00a33m over its dealings with the collapsed carmaker MG Rover after that was reduced from a \u00a314m penalty following an appeal. Simon Bradburn, PwC\u2019s then audit engagement partner, was fined \u00a375,600, reduced from \u00a3120,000 as part of the settlement, and also received a severe reprimand. The penalties come nearly a year after Cattles settled a lawsuit with PwC that alleged the accountants acted negligently in its auditing of the Yorkshire firm during the financial crisis. Cattles, which almost went bankrupt over accounting irregularities, claimed that the loan book of Welcome was much weaker than stated in PwC\u2019s audit. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of creditors to Cattles, which lent to people with poor credit histories and entered into a financial restructuring scheme in 2011. The FRC said that PwC and Bradburn had admitted their \u201cconduct fell significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected of a member firm and a member\u201d in respect of the 2007 financial statements. The watchdog said: \u201cPwC had insufficient audit evidence as to the adequacy of the loan loss provision and had failed to identify the fact that the impairment policy was not adequately disclosed and that the disclosures in those financial statements were not in compliance\u201d with accountancy rules. Gareth Rees QC, executive counsel to the FRC, said: \u201cThe substantial fines imposed in this case reflect the seriousness of the audit failings in relation to the critical area of impairment provisioning in a subprime lender and will send a strong signal to the audit community of the importance of upholding high standards of professional conduct in audit work.\u201d He welcomed PwC\u2019s and Bradburn\u2019s \u201cconstructive approach, which has enabled us to reach this settlement. The admissions of misconduct have resulted in a significant saving in time and costs and the fines ultimately imposed have been reduced accordingly.\u201d PwC said: \u201cWhile the FRC has acknowledged that we had been deliberately misled by third parties, we recognise that certain aspects of this 2007 audit fell short of expected standards. Audit quality is of paramount importance to PwC and the FRC\u2019s annual audit quality assessments have shown a trend of improvement in our work over several years.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>PricewaterhouseCoopers has been fined \u00a32.3m by the accountancy watchdog over its auditing of the subprime lender Cattles and its biggest division, Welcome Financial Services, in 2007.</p> <p>The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) also issued the accountancy firm with a severe reprimand. The fine was reduced from \u00a33.5m after mitigation and a settlement discount. In addition, PwC has to pay \u00a3750,000 towards the FRC\u2019s costs.</p> <p>The FRC said the \u00a33.5m original fine would have been the largest ever. In early 2015,<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/13/deloitte-appeal-over-mg-rover-collapse-sees-14m-fine-cut-to-3m\"> Deloitte was fined \u00a33m over its dealings with the collapsed carmaker MG Rover</a> after that was reduced from a \u00a314m penalty following an appeal.</p> <p>Simon Bradburn, PwC\u2019s then audit engagement partner, was fined \u00a375,600, reduced from \u00a3120,000 as part of the settlement, and also received a severe reprimand.</p> <p>The penalties come nearly a year after Cattles settled a lawsuit with PwC that alleged the accountants acted negligently in its auditing of the Yorkshire firm during the financial crisis. Cattles, which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/15/dennis-nally-pwc-auditors-pay-more\">almost went bankrupt over accounting irregularities</a>, claimed that the loan book of Welcome was much weaker than stated in PwC\u2019s audit. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of creditors to Cattles, which lent to people with poor credit histories and entered into a financial restructuring scheme in 2011.</p> <p>The FRC said that PwC and Bradburn had admitted their \u201cconduct fell significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected of a member firm and a member\u201d in respect of the 2007 financial statements. </p> <p>The watchdog said: \u201cPwC had insufficient audit evidence as to the adequacy of the loan loss provision and had failed to identify the fact that the impairment policy was not adequately disclosed and that the disclosures in those financial statements were not in compliance\u201d with accountancy rules.</p> <p>Gareth Rees QC, executive counsel to the FRC, said: \u201cThe substantial fines imposed in this case reflect the seriousness of the audit failings in relation to the critical area of impairment provisioning in a subprime lender and will send a strong signal to the audit community of the importance of upholding high standards of professional conduct in audit work.\u201d</p> <p>He welcomed PwC\u2019s and Bradburn\u2019s \u201cconstructive approach, which has enabled us to reach this settlement. The admissions of misconduct have resulted in a significant saving in time and costs and the fines ultimately imposed have been reduced accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>PwC said:<strong> </strong>\u201cWhile the FRC has acknowledged that we had been deliberately misled by third parties, we recognise that certain aspects of this 2007 audit fell short of expected standards. Audit quality is of paramount importance to PwC and the FRC\u2019s annual audit quality assessments have shown a trend of improvement in our work over several years.\u201d </p>",

Pressure on the ECB increased when the European commission\u2019s statistical agency, Eurostat, published figures that showed core inflation in July was lower than in same month last year, despite aggressive action by the Frankfurt-based bank over the past 18 months. With concerns that the eurozone recovery was losing momentum, Eurostat said the headline rate of inflation remained unchanged at 0.2% in August. Core, or underlying inflation, which excludes energy, goods, alcohol and tobacco, fell from 0.9% in July to 0.8%. Separate Eurostat data showed that eurozone unemployment was unchanged at 10.1% in July, the latest month for which figures are available for all 19 countries that use the euro. The jobless rate in the eurozone has fallen from 10.8% over the past year, but financial markets had been expecting the reduction to continue to 10% last month. The ECB has been using negative interest rates and quantitative easing in an attempt to increase activity and push inflation back towards its target of just below 2%. Analysts said the inflation and unemployment figures would be discussed when the ECB meets to discuss policy options next week. Stephen Brown of consultancy Capital Economics said: \u201cThe unchanged headline inflation rate in August highlights the fact that price pressures in the eurozone remain weak and boosts the case for more monetary easing from the ECB. \u201cWith [the] survey data also pointing to a marked slowdown in growth ahead, there is a strong case for the ECB to announce further policy easing.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are edging lower on the day but still look like posting a more than 1% gain for the month. Banks are among the main gainers, boosted by a number of positive economic signals from the UK despite the Brexit vote, the latest being consumer confidence figures. So Barclays is 4.1p better at 173.25p while Lloyds Banking Group has been lifted 0.82p to 59.68p. HSBC, 10.7p higher at 568.2p, has also been helped by Deutsche Bank analysts raising their target price from 514p to 525p, albeit with a hold rating. The analysts believe the bank may benefit from being broken up, saying the costs of running a global business appear to outweigh the benefits. They said: The announcement of a $2.5bn share buyback at HSBC\u2019s interim results surprised market consensus that had been factoring in the prospect of a dividend cut. In this report we lay out a \u201cCapital Map\u201d for the HSBC Group that shows clearly where the group allocates capital geographically, what the returns generated on that capital are &amp; what the cash dividend paying capability is of each operating company up to the group. This we believe not only helps shed greater light on the sustainability of group dividend but illuminates the areas where the group still has large sums of capital allocated inefficiently. We believe our \u201cCapital map\u201d exercise also sheds greater light on the cost of \u201cbeing HSBC\u201d. Our analysis identifies two clear costs: 1) capital trapped in subsidiaries making sub-cost of equity returns but viewed as essential to generating group-wide synergies (e.g. GBM in the US); 2) the cost of group centre (we estimate this alone is around 2-3% drag on group return on equity). At present we believe there is little compelling evidence that the benefits of running a global HSBC are outweighing these costs. Whilst this remains the case it is hard to see HSBC\u2019s shares out-perform peers with cleaner and less complex business models. The estimated S$4.5bn annual bill for [the holding company] that we estimate in this report plus the capital trapped making sub-par returns in subsidiaries to generate the \u201cnetwork effect\u201d raises more fundamental questions for HSBC. Unless this bill comes down meaningfully in the coming years, or \u201cnetwork\u201d related revenues increase, it remains a considerable drag on group returns, and thus valuation. It may not be the right moment for HSBC to consider a wholesale breakup of the group into 3-4 separate companies \u2013 some Hold Co / central costs would undoubtedly trickle down into the separate business. Indeed there may never be a perfect time, given the risks and frictional costs involved. However, we struggle to think of a time in recent history when the case for a breakup of HSBC has been stronger. Ironically a report in a German newspaper that Deutsche Bank was considering a merger with rival Commerzbank has also helped lift the banking sector. Housebuilders are also higher after Nationwide said house prices rose in August. Berkeley Group, likely to be ejected from the FTSE 100 at today\u2019s reshuffle in favour of miner Polymetal International, is 81p better at \u00a326.76 and Persimmon has put on 7p to \u00a318.40. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 10.43 points at 6810.36, with mining groups pushing the index lower as the strength of the dollar continues to weigh on commodity prices. Fresnillo has fallen 52p to \u00a316.38 and Anglo American is down 215p at \u00a371.45. Elsewhere equipment rental group HSS has slumped 5p to 80p despite a 13.5% rise in half year revenues, as analysts worried about lower operating margins. Investment group Toscafund wants rival Speedy Hire to merge with HSS. Peel Hunt said: [The] outlook remains cautious and we reduce our December 2016 profit before tax from \u00a313.0m to \u00a39m (cons \u00a311m) to give earnings per share of 4.6p from 6.7p. We assume progress remains challenged in 2017 and reduce our December 2017 profit before tax from \u00a321.8m to \u00a312.0m to give earnings per share of 6.2p from 11.0p.

    "webTitle": "UK house prices edge up in August, Nationwide says", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "House price growth picked up slightly in August, despite the Brexit vote, according to Nationwide Building Society. The average price of a home rose 0.6% to \u00a3206,145 between July and August, according to the Nationwide house price index (pdf) \u2013 one of two major monthly surveys by UK mortgage lenders. This compares with a 0.5% monthly gain in June. The annual rate picked up to 5.6% from 5.2%. Nationwide said both demand and supply had been weak, adding that the outlook for the housing market remained clouded. Recent figures from the Bank of England showed mortgage approvals fell to an 18-month low in July. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cThe pick-up in price growth is somewhat at odds with signs that housing market activity has slowed in recent months. New buyer inquiries have softened as a result of the introduction of additional stamp duty on second homes in April and the uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum. The number of mortgages approved for house purchase fell to an 18-month low in July. \u201cHowever, the decline in demand appears to have been matched by weakness on the supply side of the market. Surveyors report that instructions to sell have also declined and the stock of properties on the market remains close to 30-year lows. This helps to explain why the pace of house price growth has remained broadly stable.\u201d He said the outlook for the housing market depended to a large extent on what happens in the job market along with confidence among potential buyers. Business surveys suggest that the manufacturing, services and construction industries all slowed sharply in July, which if sustained is likely to have a negative impact on the labour market and consumer confidence. The Bank of England\u2019s recent stimulus package, including an interest rate cut to a new record low of 0.25% on 4 August, should provide some support for households and the housing market. However, Gardner noted that the proportion of mortgage balances on variable rates was lower than average at present (45% versus an average of 60% since 2001) and the typical saving from a quarter-point cut in interest rates is about \u00a315 a month. The Bank\u2019s decision to buy an additional \u00a360bn of UK government bonds will put downward pressure on long-term interest rates, which will, in turn, help to lower the cost of fixed rate mortgages, which have already declined to new all-time lows, he added. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that the Nationwide data was \u201cincongruous to all the other noises from the housing market\u201d. For instance, the net balance of surveyors reporting that prices increased over the previous three months slumped to +5 in July, from an average of +36 in the first half of 2016, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The Nationwide measure is based only on the lender\u2019s mortgage offers, so it is susceptible to sampling issues, he said. Tombs said the annual growth rate on the Nationwide measure of house prices was not always an accurate guide to the official data.",

      "body": "<p>House price growth picked up slightly in August, despite the Brexit vote, according to Nationwide Building Society.</p> <p>The average price of a home rose 0.6% to \u00a3206,145 between July and August, according to the <a href=\"http://www.nationwide.co.uk/~/media/MainSite/documents/about/house-price-index/2016/Aug_2016.pdf\">Nationwide house price index</a> (pdf) \u2013 one of two major monthly surveys by UK mortgage lenders. This compares with a 0.5% monthly gain in June. The annual rate picked up to 5.6% from 5.2%.</p> <p>Nationwide said both demand and supply had been weak, adding that the outlook for the housing market remained clouded. Recent figures from the Bank of England showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/uk-mortgage-approvals-fall-to-18-month-low-july-brexit-vote-housing-market\">mortgage approvals fell to an 18-month low in July</a>.</p> <p>Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cThe pick-up in price growth is somewhat at odds with signs that housing market activity has slowed in recent months. New buyer inquiries have softened as a result of the introduction of additional stamp duty on second homes in April and the uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum. The number of mortgages approved for house purchase fell to an 18-month low in July. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, the decline in demand appears to have been matched by weakness on the supply side of the market. Surveyors report that instructions to sell have also declined and the stock of properties on the market remains close to 30-year lows. This helps to explain why the pace of house price growth has remained broadly stable.\u201d</p> <p>He said the outlook for the housing market depended to a large extent on what happens in the job market along with confidence among potential buyers. Business surveys suggest that the manufacturing, services and construction industries all slowed sharply in July, which if sustained is likely to have a negative impact on the labour market and consumer confidence.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-interest-rates-stimulus-inflation-report-business-live\">The Bank of England\u2019s recent stimulus package</a>, including an interest rate cut to a new record low of 0.25% on 4 August, should provide some support for households and the housing market. However, Gardner noted that the proportion of mortgage balances on variable rates was lower than average at present (45% versus an average of 60% since 2001) and the typical saving from a quarter-point cut in interest rates is about \u00a315 a month.</p> <p>The Bank\u2019s decision to buy an additional \u00a360bn of UK government bonds will put downward pressure on long-term interest rates, which will, in turn, help to lower the cost of fixed rate mortgages, which have already declined to new all-time lows, he added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a2b2e44e9598fccd51cdab5ae8a76a9e4fc75121\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2b2e44e9598fccd51cdab5ae8a76a9e4fc75121/0_0_446_295/446.jpg\" alt=\"Mortgage rates\" width=\"446\" height=\"295\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mortgage rates</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bank of England</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that the Nationwide data was \u201cincongruous to all the other noises from the housing market\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Labor has moved a motion to introduce a banking royal commission in an attempt to derail the government\u2019s agenda on the first substantive day of parliament since the election. But the government has shut the move down, pointing to a new inquiry into small business lending practices and other reforms to argue the royal commission is not needed. Bill Shorten, the opposition leader, on Wednesday sought a suspension of standing orders in the lower house to call for a royal commission. The motion was seconded by independent MP Bob Katter. Shorten said that scandals in the banking and financial services industry have gutted retirees\u2019 savings, \u201crorted\u201d families and resulted in life insurance policy holders being denied justice. He cited examples including allegations of rate-fixing in the banking sector and insurance policies being denied for \u201chaving the wrong type of heart attack\u201d. \u201cDespite several inquiries, new powers, new resources, and a financial ombudsman service, the rorts and the rip offs continue.\u201d Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, the minister for revenue and financial services, announced on Wednesday the government has asked the Australian small business and family enterprise ombudsman to look at how banks treat their small business lending customers. The ombudsman will report within 12 weeks and provide interim findings to the Ramsay review examining external dispute resolution schemes in the financial services sector. The government shut down Labor\u2019s call for a royal commission, successfully amending the motion to instead question why Labor had not instituted an inquiry when it was in government. Coalition MP George Christensen, formerly an advocate for a bank royal commission, moved the motion. He noted the Ramsay review \u2013 led by corporate law expert Professor Ian Ramsay \u2013 was under way and that the Australian Securities and Investment Commission had commenced prosecutions on the rate-rigging allegations. Christensen pointed to government initiatives including increasing the resources of Asic and a new process to haul banks before a parliamentary committee to explain failing to pass on interest rate cuts. \u201cIf a royal commission were to go ahead it would simply be reviewing old ground,\u201d he said. The leader of the opposition proposed areas of focus for the commission, including consideration of how widespread unethical behaviour is, financial institutions\u2019 duty of care, and whether regulators are equipped to prevent illegal and unethical behaviour. Shorten said the breadth and scope of the allegations showed problems in the industry \u201cgo beyond any one bank, type of financial institution or group of receivers\u201d. He accused the government of running a \u201cprotection racket\u201d by refusing opposition demands for a royal commission. \u201cYou can take Malcolm Turnbull out of the investment bank, but you can\u2019t take the investment banker out of Malcolm Turnbull,\u201d he said, referring to the prime minister\u2019s former career in finance. Shorten said Labor, the Greens, crossbench, and at least eight Liberal and National parliamentarians had supported a royal commission. But the appetite for a royal commission is waning amongst some of those Coalition MPs, with Warren Entsch, previously a fierce advocate, now proposing a bank victim compensation tribunal instead. On 16 August Katter blasted Entsch for the back-flip, accusing him of \u201cdogging it\u201d and pleading with him to back a royal commission. Shorten said a royal commission \u201cis the only forum with the coercive powers and broad jurisdiction necessary to properly perform this investigation\u201d. He invited Turnbull to meet with the victims of banking and financial scandals.",
