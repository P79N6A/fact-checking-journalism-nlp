The grocer described the new service, called ToYou, as a game changer. It means shoppers will be able pick up and return online orders of George clothing and non-Asda brands at any of the retailer\u2019s 614 shops. The online fashion retailer Missguided has signed up to the service and Asda is close to signing deals with other brands. The service is designed to take advantage of the grocer\u2019s investment in its delivery network such as warehouses and vans, but also provide another reason for shoppers to visit its supermarkets. Asda believes ToYou could lead to 40 million extra customer visits to its shops every year by 2019. Its supermarkets are under pressure from changes to shopping habits and the rise of the discounters Aldi and Lidl. Like-for-like sales fell 4.7% in the second quarter of 2015, the worst performance in the company\u2019s history. However, Ian Stansfield, vice-president of Asda\u2019s logistics and supply chain, said the ToYou service \u2013 the first of its kind in the grocery industry \u2013 could distinguish the company from its rivals. \u201cGetting our big box estate moving again and providing services people will use is really important,\u201d he said, adding that he was \u201cextremely positive\u201d about signing up further retailers to ToYou. Customers will be able to track their order in real time and then collect it from a kiosk or self-service point within the Asda store. The introduction of the ToYou service means Asda can offer next-day delivery on George clothing orders that are placed before 9pm the previous day, rather than 7pm as before. Stansfield said: \u201cDemand for online shopping is ever increasing, with it grows the appetite from online retailers to have physical footprints their customers can access. Not only are we providing online retailers with a presence on the high street we\u2019re also bridging a gap for customers who want to collect or return their online orders while carrying out their weekly shop. \u201cThis is an industry first: complete, real time, individual parcel tracking \u2013 whether collect or return, every step of a parcels journey is tracked and visible to our clients and customers. This truly is game-changing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has said City fraudsters should receive the same treatment as shoplifters as he joined forces with the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, to promise the public that the scandal-hit financial sector was being cleansed of wrongdoing. The chancellor said he understood the anger felt by voters towards bankers guilty of multimillion pound rip-offs and said they should be treated like other criminals if they broke the law. In a combined show of intent by the UK\u2019s top economic policy makers at an event designed to tackle public disquiet over the state of one of the economy\u2019s most important sectors, Carney said there was still work to do to root out the City\u2019s \u201cbad apples\u201d. The governor and the chancellor were speaking at an initiative by the Bank to justify the purpose of financial markets after the banking crisis and market-rigging scandals in the interest rate and current markets. These events had shown the markets were \u201cfragile, unfair, ineffective and unaccountable\u201d, Carney said. Osborne used his appearance at the Open Forum \u2013 a gathering of bankers, policy makers, academics and members of the public \u2013 to justify tougher action against those who manipulated financial markets. The chancellor said fines on the industry were working, saying \u201cif anyone thought that being unethical in the financial services industry is a good way to make money I suggest they look at the very big fines\u201d levied on the industry. US, UK and European banks have been fined more than $150bn by international authorities since 2009. Osborne said he totally understood the public\u2019s anger at the bankers, who had been responsible for the \u201cbiggest single economic crash of our lifetimes\u201d. He added that there were punishments for shoplifters but \u201cif you rip off people to the tune of millions of pounds, there are no criminal offences\u201d. \u201cIf you go and shoplift at the local WH Smiths you go to prison, but if you\u2019re the market trader on the trading floor of a big investment bank and you rip off people to the tune of millions of pounds, there are no criminal offences available to deal with you,\u201d said Osborne. He had now changed the rules, he said. Carney said that under new rules to be introduced in the New Year, senior managers would have to ensure that junior traders and fund managers knew what a \u201ctrue market\u201d was. Despite a series of changes to the way the City operated there was still more to be done. Some rules may need to be rethought, he said. \u201cThe era of \u2018heads I win; tails you lose\u2019 capitalism is drawing to a close. Complex webs of derivatives are being simplified and made safer. We are also working to turn the tide of ethical drift,\u201d Carney said. In an interview with Sky News, Carney said: \u201cThere is still work to root out those bad apples but I think we\u2019ve got to recognise that there is a lot of good in financial services. It makes a huge difference to our economy.\u201d Carney spoke of the need for the Open Forum at the Mansion House speech in July and called for 10-year prison sentences to clamp down on bad behaviour. Only a third of people believe markets work in the interest of society, the governor said. The event took place at a time when the industry is questioning some of the rules put in place since the 2008 crisis to make bankers more accountable and banks less likely to need taxpayer bailouts and markets more difficult to rig. Referring to these changes, Carney said: \u201cMisconduct will be met with genuine penalties. By holding individuals accountable, authorities are ending the age of irresponsibility.\u201d But the governor acknowledged changes to the rules might be needed: \u201cGiven the complexity and scale of financial reform, it would be remarkable if every measure were perfectly constructed. Or if they all fit seamlessly into a totally coherent, self-reinforcing whole.\u201d Just a handful of the 400 or so audience members raised their hands when asked it if was case of \u201cjob done\u201d in terms of regulatory reform. Tracey McDermott, acting chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, was asked if the regulator was going soft on the City after imposing a wave of fines and compensation payouts. \u201cWe can\u2019t have a sustainable regulatory framework, can\u2019t have customer trust \u2026 unless we are actually starting to look \u2026 at what we want the future to look like,\u201d she said. She added later: \u201cI am not going soft on the banks \u2026 If we take the stick away the carrot won\u2019t be useful.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Eight years after the financial crisis, the Bank of England decided it was safe to invite outsiders to an \u201copen forum\u201d on financial markets. Regulators tend to welcome onlookers when they think they are doing a fine job and, sure enough, the governor, Mark Carney, set the tone by declaring the age of \u201cheads I win; tails you lose capitalism\u201d is coming to an end. Up to a point, the boast is reasonable. There is greater confidence that taxpayers would not be on the hook in a repeat of a 2007-08-style banking crisis. Capital cushions are plumper; ringfencing rules and banks\u2019 so-called living wills should make bondholders bear pain before the bill lands on the public purse. The system has yet to be tested under fire \u2013 the only true measure \u2013 and bankers grumble that the search for resilience has created a new danger by removing liquidity from markets. But the new regime is plainly an improvement on the past; it could hardly be worse. As for personal accountability in banking \u2013 well, the jury is out. It is alarming that the banking lobby has succeeded in watering down rules that would have obliged senior managers to prove they had acted responsibly. Parliament backed the idea after long debate; the industry screamed with fury and is getting its way. But here\u2019s the bigger complaint: whatever happened to the idea that strong financial markets require greater competition, not just better regulation? In the (understandable) desire to squash outrageous abuses such as the rigging of Libor and foreign exchange markets, the pro-competition agenda seems to have been shelved. In the City, the princely fees charged by investment banks in rights issues and fundraisings continue to look like legalised extortion at the expense of clients and investors. On the high street, the Competition and Markets Authority delivered a report of astonishing timidity that would reinforce the current oligopoly \u2013 even hardened cynics were shocked. If we have to wait for new technology (trumpeted in George Osborne\u2019s contribution) to improve matters, the race will be long. The charge, then, against the regulators and politicians is this: the technocratic fixes \u2013 the stress-tests, the capital requirements, the ringfencing regime \u2013 are being executed well. But effective markets should also be competitive, and it\u2019s hard to say we are even close to that in the financial world. Instead, there seems to be a new form of regulatory capture \u2013 a quiet agreement that greater resilience has been hard to secure so nobody will shout too loudly about the benefits to consumers of harder competition. In other words, it\u2019s good news that Carney\u2019s coin is less weighted than it was, but the odds still favour the old order. TalkTalk hopes to emulate Nike\u2019s bounce TalkTalk made an eye-catching claim in its post-cyber attack half-year figures. It said protecting customers\u2019 data better, and rewarding loyalty, \u201cwill, in time, more than mitigate any lasting impact of the attack\u201d. More than mitigate? Really? Every threat is an opportunity, they say, but is chief executive Lady Harding suggesting that TalkTalk will be a net winner eventually? Yes, something like that. She argues that customers whose complaints are dealt with satisfactorily are more loyal. She offers Nike, once under fire for use of sweatshops, as a brand that responded to a crisis and emerged stronger, as TalkTalk hopes to do. TalkTalk is not Nike, however, so let\u2019s see if life runs so happily. Its recent history has been an admirable attempt by Harding over many years to shed a reputation for lousy customer service. It\u2019s impossible to know how much good work has been undone. The \u00a335m upfront cost is manageable, and giving all customers freebie upgrades is sensible, but the damage to the brand will emerge only when contracts expire \u2013 just the 4% of customers directly affected were allowed to cancel early. Meanwhile, Harding is sticking to her medium-term financial targets but insists it is \u201ctoo early to say\u201d whether the promised 25% profit margin will arrive on schedule in the next financial year. That\u2019s a cop-out, but a wise one. Is boredom eating into supermarket profits? Sainsbury\u2019s 18% fall in half-year profits counts as a half-decent result for a supermarket chain these days. The old problems we know about \u2013 commodity deflation, discounters, internet shopping, etcetera. But the retailer\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, put his finger on another. In a reversal of 30 years of post-recessionary trends, grocery sales have not risen when disposable incomes have improved. Spare cash is going instead on eating out, clothes and holidays. We\u2019re bored of supermarkets, as Coupe didn\u2019t put it, obviously.",

Capital cushions are plumper; ringfencing rules and banks\u2019 so-called living wills should make bondholders bear pain before the bill lands on the public purse.</p> <p>The system has yet to be tested under fire \u2013 the only true measure \u2013 and bankers grumble that the search for resilience has created a new danger by removing liquidity from markets. But the new regime is plainly an improvement on the past; it could hardly be worse.</p> <p>As for personal accountability in banking \u2013 well, the jury is out. It is alarming that the banking lobby has succeeded in watering down rules that would have obliged senior managers to prove they had acted responsibly. Parliament backed the idea after long debate; the industry screamed with fury and is getting its way.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the bigger complaint: whatever happened to the idea that strong financial markets require greater competition, not just better regulation? In the (understandable) desire to squash outrageous abuses such as the rigging of Libor and foreign exchange markets, the pro-competition agenda seems to have been shelved.</p> <p>In the City, the princely fees charged by investment banks in rights issues and fundraisings continue to look like legalised extortion at the expense of clients and investors. On the high street, the Competition and Markets Authority delivered a report of astonishing timidity that would reinforce the current oligopoly \u2013 even hardened cynics were shocked. If we have to wait for new technology (trumpeted in George Osborne\u2019s contribution) to improve matters, the race will be long.</p> <p>The charge, then, against the regulators and politicians is this: the technocratic fixes \u2013 the stress-tests, the capital requirements, the ringfencing regime \u2013 are being executed well. But effective markets should also be competitive, and it\u2019s hard to say we are even close to that in the financial world. Instead, there seems to be a new form of regulatory capture \u2013 a quiet agreement that greater resilience has been hard to secure so nobody will shout too loudly about the benefits to consumers of harder competition.</p> <p>In other words, it\u2019s good news that Carney\u2019s coin is less weighted than it was, but the odds still favour the old order.</p> <h2>TalkTalk hopes to emulate Nike\u2019s bounce</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"650aed8f0f0e523c46a1a600986f5daff32ca56d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/650aed8f0f0e523c46a1a600986f5daff32ca56d/185_0_3204_1921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"TalkTalk has made an admirable attempt to boost its reputation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">TalkTalk has made an admirable attempt to boost its reputation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>TalkTalk made an eye-catching claim in its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/11/talktalk-raises-dividend-cyber-attack-costs-revealed\">post-cyber attack half-year figures</a>. It said protecting customers\u2019 data better, and rewarding loyalty, \u201cwill, in time, more than mitigate any lasting impact of the attack\u201d.</p> <p>More than mitigate? Really? Every threat is an opportunity, they say, but is chief executive Lady Harding suggesting that TalkTalk will be a net winner eventually? Yes, something like that. She argues that customers whose complaints are dealt with satisfactorily are more loyal. She offers Nike, once under fire for use of sweatshops, as a brand that responded to a crisis and emerged stronger, as TalkTalk hopes to do.</p> <p>TalkTalk is not Nike, however, so let\u2019s see if life runs so happily. Its recent history has been an admirable attempt by Harding over many years to shed a reputation for lousy customer service. It\u2019s impossible to know how much good work has been undone. The \u00a335m upfront cost is manageable, and giving all customers freebie upgrades is sensible, but the damage to the brand will emerge only when contracts expire \u2013 just the 4% of customers directly affected were allowed to cancel early.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Harding is sticking to her medium-term financial targets but insists it is \u201ctoo early to say\u201d whether the promised 25% profit margin will arrive on schedule in the next financial year. That\u2019s a cop-out, but a wise one.</p> <h2>Is boredom eating into supermarket profits?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe17a0fb9cb487e41f95e11d1fb69734a024d7bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe17a0fb9cb487e41f95e11d1fb69734a024d7bb/0_233_3492_2095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sainsbury\u2019s profits slump was better than feared.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sainsbury\u2019s profits slump was better than feared.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/11/sainsburys-profits-slide-amid-supermarket-price-war\">Sainsbury\u2019s 18% fall in half-year profits</a> counts as a half-decent result for a supermarket chain these days.

In a reversal of 30 years of post-recessionary trends, grocery sales have not risen when disposable incomes have improved. Spare cash is going instead on eating out, clothes and holidays.

      "bodyText": "Telecoms group TalkTalk is offering customers a free upgrade following the cyber-attack which left many of them panicking that money was being stolen from their accounts. The company has also made it clear, however, that customers who have decided to terminate their contracts because of the uncertainty cannot do that for free unless they can show they have been \u201cfinancially impacted\u201d by the attack on the group and its customer base. The company\u2019s chief executive, Dido Harding, said on Thursday that the group would offer each of its customers a free upgrade, which could include either premium movies or sports content for a certain period, a broadband health check, a mobile SIM, or unlimited UK landline and mobile calls. Harding said: \u201cThis is a small gesture of goodwill after a period of uncertainty.\u201d The group was unspecific about the value of its offer, however. It says that it will be contacting customers between 1 December and 31 December with further details. It is also introducing a new bundle of online and telephone security measures to help protect customers from scammers, malware and cold callers. In a statement to its customers, TalkTalk said: \u201cWe would like to apologise for the unavoidable uncertainty over the last few months, whilst we have been working hard to understand the extent of the data accessed during our recent cyber attack.\u201d Some customers have argued on social media that they should be allowed to get out of contracts free of charge given the scale of uncertainty caused by the attack and the way the group has dealt with it so publicly. \u201cThere\u2019s a helpline for all those who have been directly affected, and I would encourage anybody who is worried to call us,\u201d Harding said. The group, which competes against the likes of BT, Sky and Virgin, has put the cost of last month\u2019s cyber-attack at up to \u00a335m but confounded market expectations by raising its dividend, sending its shares soaring by just over 10% on Thursday. TalkTalk shares raced ahead to 245p before settling back to just under 240p at Thursday\u2019s close, but they are still below the 290p level at which they were trading before the cyber-attack last month. Some analysts had feared that the dividend might be axed but instead it was raised by 15% to 5.29p, which Harding said underlined the group\u2019s confidence in its future. Harding said that the one-off costs covered the upgrade to customers, increased enquiries to its call centres and additional IT and technology spending, as well as lost revenue from its online sales sites being down over the past three weeks. She added: \u201cWe of course saw an immediate spike in customers cancelling their direct debit, but actually after a few days we saw many of those customers reinstating their direct debits again, so time will tell, but the early signs are that customers think we are doing the right thing.\u201d It emerged last week that almost 157,000 TalkTalk customers had their personal details hacked, including 15,656 whose bank account numbers and sort codes were accessed. The total amounts to 4% of its 4 million customers. TalkTalk has faced growing criticism after it warned that the stolen customer data may not have been securely encrypted. Harding said last month she had personally been contacted by someone purporting to be the hacker, who made a ransom demand. The Metropolitan police has launched a criminal investigation into the attack, and the TalkTalk board has launched a review led by James Powell, an independent non-executive director. Harding said she had worked harder over the past three weeks than at any time over her career. \u201cI think the most important decision was to warn all of our customers at the start. That was the right thing and I would take exactly the same decision again. It was the most open and honest thing to do,\u201d said Harding, who has enjoyed the support of her chairman, Charles Dunstone, and the rest of the board so far. She explained that having access to the data alone was insufficient for criminals. \u201cTheft required the customer being conned into giving more information,\u201d she said. Not everyone agrees with that view, however. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown said on Wednesday: \u201cThe cyber attack on the company was handled badly, with hindsight. Few people were affected and little of any value was taken. Yet TalkTalk dominated the headlines for days on end. \u201cClearly, the company\u2019s systems were tested and found wanting, and TalkTalk have a job to do rebuilding customers\u2019 confidence in the integrity of their systems,\u201d the broker said. Though it added that it is upbeat about the decision to reward customers with free upgrades. \u201cOffering everyone, not just those whose data was accessed, a free upgrade is savvy; no one should mind the offer and those who take it up will presumably be re-contracting for another year or more,\u201d the broker said. \u201cSo hopefully, for limited cash cost, TalkTalk will make their customer base more secure.\u201d Revenues rose 4.7% to \u00a3912m in the six months to 30 September. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell to \u00a390m from \u00a3110m. The cyber-attack was the second time in the past 12 months that TalkTalk customers have been affected by data breaches.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Carlsberg is to axe 2,000 staff, including up to 100 in the UK, where it plans to cut lager production after Tesco said it would stop stocking its beers. The Danish firm said it would cut production at its Northampton plant after its strategy of using price promotions to deliver higher supermarket sales fell flat. The world\u2019s fourth-largest beer producer announced the overhaul on Wednesday alongside a \u00a3438m loss in the third quarter, largely caused by problems with its Russian business. Approximately 2,000 white collar jobs will be cut \u2013 4% of its global workforce of 46,800 \u2013 as part of a recovery plan Carlsberg calls Funding the Journey. The plan is expected to threaten nearly 100 jobs at its Northampton brewery, Leeds office and 12 regional distribution depots. Union sources said the move was particularly difficult for staff after the company imposed a global pay freeze in 2014. The brewer, whose adverts proclaim it to be \u201cprobably the best beer in the world\u201d has 13% of the UK market through brands such as Carlsberg, Tuborg, Tetley\u2019s and Somersby Cider. Carlsberg has previously tried to bolster sales by selling its products at bargain prices in supermarkets such as Tesco. But the retailer\u2019s decision to stop stocking Carlsberg has rendered that strategy obsolete. It has also been hit by overcapacity among major brewers, with mass-market brands coming under pressure from more premium \u201ccraft\u201d beers. Carlsberg acknowledged the so-called craft beer revolution this year by expanding its Crafted range of quality ales, lagers and stouts that it sells to pubs. These include third-party brands such as the Californian ale Lagunitas IPA, as well as some from its own stable such as the Backyard Brewery, part of its Falkenberg operation in Sweden. It plans to cut production volumes and focus on improving its image, which has suffered despite sponsoring the Premier League and England football team. Analyst Trevor Stirling, at Bernstein, said: \u2018\u2018In order to stay in Tesco they were putting money into price promotions instead of investing. They need to put more money behind the brand.\u201d Carlsberg UK\u2019s difficulties led it to it ask suppliers to wait an extra three months for payment, a request branded \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d this week by the Forum of Private Business. The company said on Tuesday it was starting a \u201cformal review of its customer supply chain operations\u201d. Michiel Herkemij has been appointed interim chief executive to oversee the planned job cuts and strategic shift. \u201cUnfortunately the proposed restructuring process may result in redundancies in some areas of the business and we will support the impacted employees through the consultation period,\u201d he said. Union officials are due to meet with Carlsberg management next week to discuss the proposed cuts. Carlsberg\u2019s third quarter loss was largely caused by a \u00a3732m cut in the value of its Russian and Chinese businesses, part of \u00a3948m in anticipated impairments by 2017. Drinkers in Russia have been switching to cheaper brands amid dismal economic conditions and a tumbling rouble, which has made foreign imports even more expensive. A turnaround plan in China also failed to bear fruit amid the twin challenges of a declining market and more intense competition.",

The German discounter said it was aiming to open 40-50 stores a year in the UK, up from the 30-40 previously planned and the 20 opened in 2014. The fast-growing company, which has helped revolutionise British shopping habits, will also refurbish up to 150 existing sites to its \u201cstore of the future\u201d concept over the next three to four years. Lidl will open the first \u00a32m store of the future in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Thursday. The 1,400 sq metres building is one of the first Lidl stores in the UK with customer toilets, baby changing facilities and self-checkouts.

The new stores will also feature longer tills so customers can pack at the checkout, wider aisles and glass frontages to make them lighter. Bryan Roberts, at retail the analysis firm Kantar, said the Rushden store combined features that Lidl had tested in a handful of other stores.

Speaking to manufacturing bosses in the Midlands on Wednesday, Umunna said Britain\u2019s recovery would suffer a setback if the chancellor sought to make savings from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and the grants that support productivity improvements and growth. Umunna, Labour MP for Streatham, said the BIS should be the engine room of the economy, supporting investment in infrastructure and innovative manufacturing processes needed to compete in the global economy. \u201cI accept the need to reduce the debt and deficit \u2013 it is a waste to be spending over \u00a330bn this year servicing our debts instead of investing it in people. But doing so by raiding growth-inducing budgets like that of the BIS \u2013 where for every pound you invest you get a multiple return in growth and tax receipts to the exchequer \u2013 is an utterly false economy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, as he puts the finishing touches to his comprehensive spending review, I say this to the chancellor: don\u2019t cut off your nose to spite your face because it will be our economy which suffers.\u201d The BIS, which has a resource budget of about \u00a313bn, is under pressure to make savings of up to 40% over the next five years as part of a spending review to be announced by George Osborne on 25 November. A report by the Resolution Foundation thinktank estimated that the department\u2019s total spending would fall by 53% between 2010 and 2020 under austerity measures planned by the Treasury. The bulk of the savings in the BIS budget since 2010 were made from shifting the burden of university funding to students under the \u00a39,000 a year loan scheme. In 2015-16, the last year of the current spending round, the department must find another \u00a3450m in cuts, with only \u00a3150m to come from the universities\u2019 teaching grant. Umunna said: \u201cIn order to drive forward the different elements of industrial strategy I\u2019ve outlined, you need a strong business department, which is a powerhouse and the engine room of government. But in the last parliament the BIS budget was cut by 32% and is projected to have been cut by 53% by end of this one.\u201d In the run-up to the spending review, which covers 2016-20, the business secretary, Sajid Javid, commissioned the management consultants McKinsey to examine the impact of merging or slimming the various bodies used by the department to dispense funds, including the higher education research councils. But the level of savings needed to meet Treasury targets is expected to force Javid to make cuts to science grants and possibly abolish the BIS and merging its responsibilities with the education department and the Treasury. The BIS is the brainchild of Peter Mandelson, who in 2009 merged the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform with the two-year old Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills.",

On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. And then Carney is gone, after a promise of drinks in the crypt for those in the Guildhall, drinks on the Daily Mail\u2019s Alex Brummer for those who attended his session in Edinburgh and for those at home, drinks in the local pub on the Bank thanks to its QE programme. Carney: [It is] the responsibility of authorities to explain why things are being done. Lot of postings said there is a lot of jargon...even as we are trying to explain things. In his closing remarks, Bank of England governor Mark Carney - who maintained his net contribution was to come up with the words Open Forum - repeated the disconnect between the sector and the public: We are all going to go back and reflect on what we\u2019ve learned. [In the sessions there was] almost universal reaffirmation of the imporatance of markets,... not just to the econmy but to people\u2019s everyday lives. But the level of trust is quite low. Disconnect in how we in finance see sector and how public see the sector. The disconnect is not in public\u2019s mind. There is optimism around institutions, a lot has been done to make banks stronger, they are beginning to adjust their business models. [We can say to them] there is no other big wave of capital regulation coming, last pieces of puzzle are put in place. Now it\u2019s about adjusting business models to new realities. Business models pre-crisis not going to be effective now. Back to trust and he said: Trust is low for two reasons, because of misconduct. lack of client focus. As we edge towards the close, both the Bank\u2019s Jon Cunliffe and chair of this final panel Sir Richard Lambert agree the discussion has been useful and should continue after this event finishes. Giles Fraser says its time to get rid of acronyms - it\u2019s a part of group think we should do without. Sir Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor at the Bank of England on credit: A rival candidate for quote of the day, from the final panel going on now. Talking about debt and credit, the Reverend Canon Giles Fraser said: We are approaching this terrible time called Christmas.. go into the Westfield shopping centre and you\u2019ll see tens of thousands of people buying lots of things they don\u2019t want with money they don\u2019t have for people they don\u2019t like. We\u2019re encouraged to do this because of this thing called growth. I worry about moral hazard of debt... Blythe Masters, the chief executive of Digital Asset Holdings, was speaking at one of the afternoon sessions. But there is a divergence between how the bankers and the public think reform of the sector is going: Adding to the theme of banking and its wider role in society as heard at the Bank of England\u2019s open forum, Mark Taylor, Dean of Warwick Business School and a former senior economist at the Bank, said: Mark Carney is on a charm offensive in order to encourage the public to think about bankers in a better way. After all we need a strong financial sector, it represents eight per cent of the UK\u2019s GDP and 20 per cent of income in London alone. It is an important part of the economy, and in order to grow other sectors like manufacturing we need a strong financial sector. But the banking sector needs to act ethically and in the best interests of society for it to work properly. We need bankers to think of their impact on society and not just on their wallet. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi may not have caused any market moving sparks in his speech at the Open Forum earlier. But Reuters is reporting that the ECB is considering extending its QE programme by buying municipal bonds of cities like Paris or regions like Bavaria, according to sources. Reuters says: This regional bond buying could be one in a series of measures to be rolled out in the coming months, although one of the sources said time was short for a full launch in December and that this would likely come by March next year. The ECB declined to comment. Despite the ECB\u2019s scheme of quantitative easing (QE) to buy chiefly state bonds, the eurozone\u2019s economy is growing only modestly and the central bank is urgently considering what more it can do to improve it and stagnant price inflation. As part of preparations for the next rate-setting meeting of policy-setters on Dec. 3, ECB officials are now analysing whether and how to extend its shopping list to municipal bonds, issued by, say, Madrid or Mainz, or a federal German state. \u201cYou have big markets, such as Spain and Italy. France has a well developed market,\u201d said one person. According to data from Thomson Reuters IFR, almost $500 billion of bonds issued by European cities and regions are in circulation. The regions have sold more than $76 billion of bonds over the last year. The source said that while some cities were risky, they had the fallback of central governments. Municipal bonds typically have a lower credit rating than governments. It is a fragmented market in Europe, with many small issues. Back with the Bank of England\u2019s Open Forum, and here\u2019s something to illustrate the main themes, ahead of the day\u2019s summing up. Elsewhere, the Bank of Spain has said the country\u2019s third quarter GDP grew 0.8% quarter on quarter. It repeated its estimate of 3.1% growth in 2015 and 2.7% in 2016. But it admits the risks to these forecasts have increased since June. Meanwhile in Greece, the country\u2019s banks will need less than \u20ac10bn for recapitalisation, MNI is reporting. There\u2019s not much to argue with here....and maybe that\u2019s the problem: Some analysis of Draghi\u2019s speech: Professor Mariana Mazzucato has been busy debunking hype in the world of financial innovation. She told a panel at the Open Forum that many new wizzy ideas have actually helped companies to extract wealth, and give very little back society: Has the Bank of England done any war gaming and worked out under what conditions it would intervene in the markets? Couldn\u2019t possibly say, Minouche laughs. But generally, Bank officials have done a lot of work on this general issue to prepare for a liquidity crisis. Axel Weber, chairman of UBS, warns there is a \u2018vacuum\u2019 in the markets now as some institutions - such as UBS - no longer act as market makers. He cites the impact of new tougher regulations, which make it too risky and costly. And that could be a risk, when the next crisis strikes and everyone wants liquidity.... Flicking between this afternoon\u2019s discussions at the Open Forum, there\u2019s a lot of talk about market liquidity. Asset managers are explaining that liquidity could easily evaporate once the next crisis strikes, as many investors have already cut their exposure to riskier assets. And deputy governor Minouche Shafik is also discussing it, saying: Liquidity is a public good, and central bankers have a duty to guarantee it. And the last crisis showed that central banks can widen their remit and pump money into non-banks (such as insurance group AIG in America). But there are \u201cvery real risks\u201d, Shafik continues, in acting like a market-maker of last resort, and buying assets when everyone wants to sell. 1) The moral hazard issue: banks won\u2019t worry about maintaining their own liquidity levels if they think the BoE will save them. 2) Financial risks: liquidity operations are much riskier than simply buying assets, And its harder to tell if an entity is solvent. 3) Political risks: there are \u2018distributions\u2019 consequences (ie: wealth distribution -- bank assets are owned by the rich, but bailouts are paid by everyone) So, it should only be a \u2018last line of defence\u2019, Shafki concludes. Over on Wall Street, e-commerce magnate Jack Ma is preparing to ring the opening bell: He\u2019s got the honour because today is Singles Day - the world\u2019s biggest day for online shopping (invented by, you guessed it, Alibaba). There are now more \u2018breakout sessions\u2019 underway - you can follow them here: An open discussion on the role of markets in society (there\u2019s an icon in the top left corner to click to jump between them) What does Mario Draghi mean when he calls for a \u201cuniform deposit insurance scheme\u201d? Well, back in June, he and four other eurozone presidents called for an EU-wide deposit insurance by 2017. That would sit on top of existing national deposit schemes, providing extra protection. Currently, each eurozone nation guarantees \u20ac100,000 of savings if a bank goes under. Those guarantees, though, are only as strong as the country in question. This is a bit harsh: OK, it wasn\u2019t the speech you\u2019ll tell your grandchildren about - but this is serious, nitty-gritty stuff, with major ramifications if regulators make another hash of things. The whole speech is online here. And that\u2019s it! Draghi isn\u2019t taking any questions, much to my dismay. And the speech didn\u2019t contain anything to get the markets moving - no hints about future stimulus measures. The eurozone does already have some banking union, with the ECB responsible for banking supervisions. But it doesn\u2019t yet have a uniform deposit insurance scheme. This is still controlled by national governments. Mario Draghi\u2019s message is that politicians need to pool more sovereignty, to ensure their financial markets work better: OK we\u2019ve got to the meat of the speech. Mario Draghi is urging eurozone leaders to crack on and actually implement a full banking union across the eurozone, including a single deposit insurance scheme to protect savers when their bank fails. The ECB president says: With a single currency the benefits of a single market are commensurately higher. But the costs of the market fragmenting are commensurately higher, too. For countries that share a single currency and a single market, therefore, the case is clear \u2013 I would say almost undeniable \u2013 for stronger common governance and deeper institutional integration. Today, that means as a priority completing banking union: a fully-equipped single resolution mechanism and a uniform deposit insurance scheme. That would mean that money was equally seen as safe wherever it was saved in the eurozone, to stop panic spreading . This is a controversial issue in the eurozone -- German taxpayers may be worried about potentially compensating Greek savers. But Draghi is clear - it\u2019s simply too risky to not have such guarantees in place when the next crisis arrives. Draghi\u2019s conclusion --all markets need proper governance to be truly free, especially in a single currency union: Those countries have entered into an irrevocable union, built on the fertile ground of Europe\u2019s common values and history, but also on deep mutual vulnerability. For those countries it is even more important to complete economic and monetary union in all its aspects. Draghi adds that attempts to clean up the asset-backed securities market after the 2008 crash also caused problems: There was \u201ctoo much opacity\u201d about what had been bundled into those products, a damaging breakdown of confidence in the integrity of those who packaged and sold them. And the immediate temptation of regulators was to impose punishing capital charges on holdings of asset-backed securities, independent of their individual characteristics, mixing the wheat with the chaff. A proper market must offer the freedom to take part, and also protection to ensure that freedom isn\u2019t lost, Draghi continues. There must be fair competition, respect for property rights... in short, the Rule of Law. If that doesn\u2019t happen, then people lose confidence and the whole system becomes destabilised. Fair enough! But we\u2019ve seen an example recently when this simply failed, causing major panic. Draghi explains: During the crisis, the market for securitised assets was all but destroyed by a collapse of confidence. Lack of oversight allowed excesses to be committed and market abuse to take place. Securities that were previously deemed safe, certainly with some measure of complacency and too much blind confidence, turned out to be very unsafe indeed, and imparted significant losses on their holders. Global trade is more important and intertwined than ever, Draghi says, with technology means distance between buyers and sellers is no longer as important. Global markets are also more closely linked, with the cost of moving capital between borders now almost zero. Draghi begins by saying that markets can be defined by the instruments traded on them - oil, gold, etc - but they\u2019re also defined by the people who use them. And you need appropriate governance to prevent misconduct - especially when markets cross borders. Lunch is over at the Guildhall, and Mario Draghi is taking the stage at the Bank of England\u2019s Open Forum. He\u2019ll be speaking for 45 minutes on the financial markets. Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, is introducing him. He reminds us that Draghi pledged 3 years ago in London to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to protect the euro. Those \u2018magic three little words\u2019 helped to calm the eurozone crisis, and put the global economy on a more even keel. We all have a lot to be thankful for to Mario, Haldane says. You can watch the session here. In other news, the car emissions scandal appears to be spreading beyond Volkswagen. German regulators have announced they will test 50 models from 23 different brands, issued by German and foreign car companies, to see if they also breach nitrogen oxides emissions levels. According to Reuters, the list includes models from BMW, Daimler, Fiat Chrysler, Peugeot and Toyota. We\u2019ll have more details online shortly. In 30 minutes time, Mario Draghi will give his views on financial markets to Forum attendees - who are currently knocking back some lunch. The ECB president seems to be enjoying his visit: Andrew Bailey, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor for Prudential Regulation, has spoken about the challenges in running a 21st century bank: Hard to believe that anyone has actually read so many pages, let alone implemented it properly.... From the Open Forum, lawyer Robin Henry confirms that the public are more sceptical about the state of Britain\u2019s financial sector than the people regulating it: Is it time to stop raking over off the mistakes that helped to cause the financial crisis? Tracy McDermott, who runs the UK\u2019s financial watchdog (the FCA) suggests it might be: The FCA was set up after the crisis; it\u2019s imposed chunky fines for various offences in recent years, including rigging the foreign exchange rates. The Bank of England is also conducting opinion polls; they\u2019ve showed that people don\u2019t believe the financial system is working well enough: One problem with playing host to the world\u2019s biggest banks is that they often collect the world\u2019s biggest fines: One attendee has already warned that innovation can\u2019t be chained down: Financial economist Jonathan Algar puts his finger on the problem with \u2018professionalising\u2019 the City: Various breakout sessions are now taking place at the BoE\u2019s event: Jill Treanor is tweeting the key points from the Guildhall: (that should be \u2018regain public approval\u2019 - silly autocorrect) I missed this, unfortunately, but it\u2019s a key issue: Osborne was clear this morning that despite the crisis of 2008 and its aftermath, Britain is still aiming to be a world-leader in finance, based around the City. The aim is to make the market function fairly, and much better than before, but that hasn\u2019t been tested yet.... Fran Boait is executive director of Positive Money, which is \u201ca movement to democratise money and banking so that it works for society and not against it\u201d. The thorny issue of the huge pay packets handed out in the City has finally reared up at the Guildhall. The public believe it is a crucial cause of the crisis - so will it be fixed? David Kynaston, visiting professor at Kingston University, argues that City remuneration must be tackled. He tells the Open Forum that: If the City and the financial markers are serious about achieving a genuine social licence, real action needs to be taken on pay because it remains a grotesque disparity. Rabbi Baroness Julia Neuberger agrees, warning that badly-structured packets create an incentive to trade that isn\u2019t in the interests of the market, but is in the interest of the individual. [This argument is often made by supports of a Tobin Tax, or Robin Hood tax] Helena Morrissey, CEO of Newton Investment Management, argues that there needs to be more \u201csymmetry\u201d among pay -- if traders get a chunk upside for doing well, there should be more downside when it goes wrong. [new rules allowing bonuses to be clawed back years after they were granted go some way to addressing this] And Jim O\u2019Neill points out that Goldman Sachs was a partnership for some of the time he worked there - so individual\u2019s capital was on the line. (that ended when Goldman floated in 1999). That could be a better model for some parts of the City, but probably not for client-facing roles, he concludes. Jim O\u2019Neill has warned the audience that there will be new financial crisis sooner or later. But if we have more diverse companies operating in the sector, the damage might be less. This is crying out for a caption competition..... It\u2019s a similar message in London: There\u2019s not much confidence in Birmingham that the financial markets are fixed. The Bank of England has set up a smaller forum in Britain\u2019s second city, to shadow events in London. Attendees were asked \u201cdo you think Financial Markets had a key role creating the financial crisis and the recession that we experienced in the UK?\u201d. Virtually everyone raised their hands: And second, \u201care you now confident that financial markets are operating in an ethical way that would prevent such a crisis and a recession hitting us again?\u201d Cue much sitting on hands..... Treasury minister Jim O\u2019Neill, a former top executive at Goldman Sachs, cautions against thinking that the financial crisis can be easily \u2018solved\u2019 It\u2019s right that we\u2019re trying to explore why the hell it was so bad...but we have to also acknowledge that we might not fully know. It\u2019s dangerous to think we\u2019ll find some magical solution to protect us for decades ahead. A panel discussions is now underway now in the Guildhall. Rabbi Baroness Neuberger is taking a historical view, saying bankers have been criticised for several generations - and they\u2019re always relieved when another industry is hit by scandal (such as Volkswagen\u2019s emissions scandal or the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico). Baroness Neuberger also argues that a banking code of conduct won\u2019t push up standards on its own. It takes outsiders to show when something is being done wrong, even if professionals are following the code. While Osborne was speaking, new data showed that Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has hit a new seven-year low of just 5.3%. But it\u2019s not all good news - wage growth was weaker than expected. Average earnings rose by 3% annually in the last quarter, but only 2% in September alone. Does George Osborne understand why the public are still so angry about the crisis, and believe that the people responsible never paid a penalty? He says he does, telling the Bank of England\u2019s Open Forum that it\u2019s perfectly understandable.... and he shares some of this frustration and anger. We were told that the City was well regulated, and people were paid high salaries because they ran big risks and would lose their jobs if things went wrong. Then along comes a big banking crash, and it turns out that the person standing behind the bank is the taxpayer. If you go and shoplift at the local WH Smiths you go to prison, but if you\u2019re the market trader on the trading floor of a big investment bank and you rip off people to the tune of millions of pounds, there are no criminal offences available to deal with you. There was a lot of totally understandable anger. The chancellor also says it\u2019s \u201ca bit optimistic\u201d for bankers to ask him when we can move on from the crisis. This was the biggest single economic crash of our lifetimes. This was a financial crisis probably larger than anything experienced since the Victorian age in our country, and an economic crash and a recession as great as anything since the 1930s. The industry, regulators and politicians must prove that the banking sector has cleaned up its game. And that\u2019s the end of his session. A questioner from the floor challenges Osborne on that last point. She points out that big fines are paid by shareholders, not the staff responsible. And the 2008 bailouts were paid by the taxpayer, not the bankers who led their firms to the cliffedge. Surely we need more accountability? Osborne says the government has created new criminal offences to cover benchmark manipulation. And individual bankers who cause their banks to fail would face seven years in prison. When I got into office [after the 2010 general election] and found out about the scandal, I changed the law. Onto questions: Would a bankers code of conduct help to restore financial trust? Osborne says that Banking, like the medical profession, engineering, architecture, has a proud history. The best practitioners want to enhance that status, and regulated by the industry itself as well as the government. The Banking Standards Board is doing good work getting codes of conduct up to date, improving exams, to reflect the ethical standards need. But he then argues that monetary penalties should keep bankers in line. If anyone thinks being unethical in the financial services industry is a good way to make money, I\u2019d suggest they take a look at the very, very large fines that a number of institutions have had to pay.....and ask whether it was worth it. Management and shareholders must take the lead, to ensure that staff don\u2019t make an extra buck on the trading floor that leads to a massive penalty for the firm, Osborne concludes. George Osborne also congratulated the Bank for running a webinar for school children this week, and admitted it was a new term to him. At least he\u2019s not the technology minister.... George Osborne says that his predecessor, Alastair Darling, had very few options when Royal Bank of Scotland hit the rocks in 2008. He didn\u2019t have legal powers to intervene, he was worried if the cash machines would keep running, he was worried about how the the retail bank would cope if the investment bank failed. So in the end, Darling had little option but to launch a huge bailout. It\u2019s vital that the chancellor has many more options the next time this happens, says Osborne. New rules on ring-fencing, capital reserves and bail-in regulations will all help. Chancellor George Osborne is now speaking, discussing the financial crisis, its aftermath, and the \u2018dilemma\u2019 created when you try to run successful markets. He explains that Guildhall was once the place where people turned up to pay their taxes, so the attendees are all \u2018very welcome\u2019. (don\u2019t worry, Osborne\u2019s too busy worrying about tax credits to announce any new taxes today) Osborne tells the audience that holidaymakers and businesses lost out because City insiders rigged the benchmarks for foreign exchange rates and derivatives. We want financial firms to innovate, create jobs, fund business. We want to be the home of the world\u2019s biggest banks. But we also want them to be safe. A date for the diary: Anyone hoping for a smaller City will be disappointed, though. Carney argues that, done right, Britain\u2019s financial sector could be bigger than ever in the decades ahead. We have also reformed financial benchmarks to end \u2018ethical drift\u2019, Carney adds. Mark Carney explains that new rules on loss-absorbing capital mean that banks will no longer be \u2018too big to fail.\u2019 The era of \u2018heads I win, tails you lose\u2019 capitalism is drawing to a close. (It\u2019s been a long road - Lehman Brothers collapsed more than seven years ago, triggering a massive bailout programme to prevent the whole system imploding) Mark Carney is now speaking. He\u2019s explaining how it\u2019s vital that financial markets work well, and are seen to work well. They should be fair, with people competing on merit not colluding online (a nod to the various scandals that have rocked the City, such as Libor). And the financial crisis has shown that the financial services sector failed to live up to these standards, says Carney, adding: So, it\u2019s not surprising that only one third of people think financial markets work in the interest of society. And that ratio actually falls among other people - experience of the financial markets leads to less confidence, not more.... London\u2019s Lord Mayor is kicking the Open Forum off, telling the audience that every firm in the financial sector must be \u201cfully engaged\u201d in society, so they\u2019re doing good for Britain. He then plugs his own City Giving Day, which pushes firms to volunteer and fundraise for good causes. The Bank of England\u2019s Open Forum is starting now in the Guildhall, just across the road from its own building - you can watch it live here. And here\u2019s the agenda of today\u2019s Bank of England Open Forum, which kicks off in a few minutes. (The \u2018senior Cabinet Minister\u2019 is chancellor Osborne) There\u2019s more detail on the Bank\u2019s website. Today\u2019s Open Forum is part of Carney\u2019s drive to end the Age of Irresponsibility in the City. Those attending will hear from the chancellor, George Osborne, as well as Carney, Draghi and many senior figures in the sector: Here\u2019s our preview: The latest attempt by the government to rehabilitate the battered reputation of the City of London takes place on Wednesday when Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, invites the public to have their say on the future of financial markets. Carney has invited the chancellor, George Osborne, and the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, to be the guests of honour at a day-long event at the Guildhall in London. Half the 400-strong audience will be made up of members of the public who were allocated their seats by ballot and will have the chance to sit alongside representatives of the banks blamed for crashing the economy and besmirching the reputation of the financial sector.... Mark Carney will soon find out whether the public respect bankers -- 200 people won tickets to today\u2019s Open Forum in a ballot: The interview ends on a mildly comedy note, as Sky\u2019s Eamonn Holmes asks Mark Carney how he copes with such Clooney-style good looks in the world of central banking. \u201cIt\u2019s a very low bar\u201d, Carney twinkles back. Hopefully that won\u2019t upset Mario Draghi -- the dapper chief of the European Central Bank is speaking at lunchtime. India\u2019s central bank chief also has his fans... Mark Carney has also vowed to \u2018root out\u2019 the remaining \u2018bad apples\u2019 in the banking sector. He told Sky News that \u201cthe system is changing\u201d so remaining bad apples in the barrel are held to account. Like any profession, finance has a lot of talented people, working with integrity to do the right thing, Carney continues. It\u2019s the UK\u2019s largest exporter, contributing 8% of GDP. We\u2019ll still work and root out those bad apples, but we need to recognise there is a lot of good in financial services. It makes a huge contribution to our economy. I might not be hugging any bankers, but increasingly the British people will be respecting them. The governor of the Bank of England governor has ruled out \u2018hugging any bankers\u2019, as he prepares to welcome the public to its first Open Forum in London. Interviewed on Sky News, Mark Carney said that Britain\u2019s financial sector has fixed some of the problems that contributed to the last financial crisis. Travelling around the UK, he\u2019s seen that the public expect two things. 1) Banks should be allowed to go bust like any other business, rather than being bailed out because they\u2019re \u2018too big to fail\u2019 2) Individual bankers should be held to account. Carney insists that progress has been made: \u201cI think what\u2019s happening now is that the bankers are starting to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.\u201d But any City workers hoping to be embraced by the dashing Bank boss will be disappointed. Asked if he\u2019ll ever hug a banker (an echo of David Cameron\u2019s famous pledge to Hug a Hoodie in 2006), Carney replies: I won\u2019t think you want your governor giving that kind of advice....Neither I nor my successors will be hugging any bankers. But his goal is to reach the point where people respect bankers, and bankers can crack on with serving the public. More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll be looking at the UK economy, with the latest unemployment report released at 9.30am GMT. It\u2019s expected to show another steady pick-up in wages - average earnings could rise by over 3%, while the jobless rate may remain at just 5.4%. A strong report might raise the chances of an early interest rate rise, although policymakers did dampen expectations last week. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets comments: A strong wages number will further reinforce the widening gap between wages and inflation and raise concerns that the Bank of England is not only behind the curve, but is on the way to being lapped. It\u2019s a big day at the Bank of England too, as the UK central bank throws open its doors for its first ever Open Forum (well, the Guildhall\u2019s doors, anyway) Those lucky enough to get a ticket will hear from governor Mark Carney, and ECB chief Mario Draghi at 1.15pm. It kicks off at 9am: In the City, supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s is reporting financial results. Sales and profits are down, as deflation continues to stalk the sector. While in Greece, talks will continue with creditors over the remaining milestones which Athens must hit before it can receive its next aid payment. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

      "bodyText": "At first glance, the latest jobs figures look curious. The economy is creating plenty of jobs. Unemployment is falling. The proportion of people in work has never been higher. These are precisely the conditions in which to expect upward pressure on wages. But pay inflation remains the dog that doesn\u2019t bark. Excluding bonuses, regular earnings in the three months to September were 2.5% higher than in the same three months of 2014. This is down from the 2.8% recorded in the quarter that ended in August. In September alone, regular pay was 1.9% higher than a year earlier, compared with a 2.6% increase in the year to August. Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses stood at \u00a3463 in September, an increase of just \u00a33 a week since March. In truth, the continued weakness of earnings should come as little surprise. There are a number of factors that taken together explain why wages are not growing as rapidly as might have been expected, given the fall in the jobless total. The first is that the low level of inflation has created an environment in which employers offer only modest increases in the annual pay round. Put simply, if inflation was running at 2%, employers would be offering 4% to attract and retain staff. But after months in which the cost of living has remained broadly unchanged, employers are offering 2% instead. The second is that the supply of labour is expanding due to inward migration. According to the Office for National Statistics data, there was an increase of 430,000 in the number of people employed in the past year. Of those, 327,000 came from outside the UK. A further breakdown shows that of those 327,000, the vast majority \u2013 291,000 \u2013 came from the EU, and of those 140,000 were from the 14 countries that were members before 2004, 132,000 were from the countries following the EU\u2019s expansion into the former communist countries of eastern Europe, and 30,000 came from Romania and Bulgaria. Increasing the supply of labour, especially from countries where earnings are lower than in the UK, will depress wage growth. Finally, there is evidence that demand for labour has weakened. There was an impressive-looking increase in net employment of 177,000 between the three months ending in June and the three months ending in September, but of that jump only 31,000 was the result of full-time jobs. The rest were part-time. In short, there is nothing in these figures that should cause the Bank of England to bring forward an increase in interest rates, even if the Federal Reserve raises the cost of borrowing in the US next month.",

The Budweiser owner AB InBev employs 155,000 people, compared with 70,000 at SAB Miller. Their combined revenues total $73bn, which is higher than companies such as Google or PepsiCo. The deal is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016, pending clearance from regulators and shareholders. AB InBev will pay \u00a344 a share for SABMiller, up from its initial offer of \u00a338 made privately in September. SABMiller will sell its 58% stake in US joint venture MillerCoors to Molson Coors for \u00a38bn, to allay competition concerns in the US. The FTSE 100 firm, which owns Peroni and Grolsch, could also be forced to offload its market-leading Snow brand in China, where the country\u2019s drinkers account for a quarter of global beer consumption. The takeover will allow Belgium\u2019s AB InBev, which also makes Stella Artois, to tap into SABMiller\u2019s strength in fast-growing African and Asian markets.

Carlos Brito, the chief executive of AB InBev, said: \u201cOur combination with SABMiller is about creating the first truly global beer company and bringing more choices to beer drinkers in markets outside of the US.\u201d The combined firm, due to be listed in Belgium, is expected to make cost savings of $1.4bn (\u00a3920m), some of which will come from reducing staff numbers. The two firms are yet to announce a name for the combined business, which has been nicknamed \u201cMegaBrew\u201d in the City of London. Agreement on the deal ends months of discussions during which the takeover panel granted three extensions to its usual time limit on mergers and takeovers. AB InBev\u2019s first offer of \u00a338 a share was rejected, prompting Brito to make a public plea to SAB Miller investors. AB InBev subsequently raised its bid four times.

    "webTitle": "Supermarkets face tough Christmas as pressure from discounters mounts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pressure on Britain\u2019s leading food retailers has been underlined this week, with Sainsbury\u2019s reporting a double-digit fall in profits and Asda scaling back its Black Friday discounts. So as grocery shopping undergoes its biggest revolution in a generation, triggered by the rise of discount retailers and online shopping, which retailer is in the best shape for Christmas? Aldi and Lidl The German discounters are the fastest growing grocery retailers in the UK by a significant margin, despite predictions that their growth would slow. The latest market share figures from Kantar show Aldi and Lidl sales are up 17.6% and 17.9% respectively year on year. The next best performing grocer is Iceland, which grew by 3.2%. It took Aldi and Lidl 20 years to understand the UK market, but now they have reset the expectations for what customers should pay for groceries. There are likely to be bumps in the road for the discount retailers as some stores become overcrowded and some shoppers are turned off by the limited assortment of goods on offer in Aldi and Lidl. However, purely on the basis that Aldi and Lidl plan to double the number of stores they have in the UK while the big four \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 halt new openings, it is easy to conclude the revolution they have sparked in grocery shopping has barely begun. In the next five years they are likely to double their share of grocery spending in the UK to 15%. Marks &amp; Spencer The 132-year-old chain has struggled to grow clothing sales, but its food business is thriving, with sales rising by 3.3% in the past six months. The basic explanation for the success of Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s food division is that shoppers are combining cut-price purchases from the discounters with treats from M&amp;S. The vast majority of products sold in M&amp;S are own-brand, meaning it is not as vulnerable to a price war as the big four \u2013 and one in five of its products is a new item. The company, which has successfully established a distinctive upmarket position in the sector, is also benefiting from the growth of convenience shopping and households not buying their food for dinner until that day. M&amp;S has almost 550 Simply Food shops, many at train stations, which are popular lunch destinations for office workers but also a place to pick up food on the way home for work. As ever, expect M&amp;S Food to enjoy Christmas. The retailer will provide a quarter of the turkeys eaten on Christmas Day \u2013 an extraordinary proportion. Waitrose The upmarket grocer, part of the John Lewis Partnership, has suffered a decline in sales in stores open for more than a year in 2015, while its boss, Mark Price, has announced he will leave early next year. However, the retailer is still growing profits and has become the most innovative in the market. Waitrose has remodelled its supermarkets and launched initiatives designed for what it believes will be the consumer of the future. These include \u201cpick your own offers\u201d, which allows customers to decide what they get a discount on, as well as in-store wine bars and free coffee and newspapers. Sainsbury\u2019s Sainsbury\u2019s has reported a 1.6% decline in like-for-like sales and an 18% fall in underlying profits before tax, regarded as the definitive measure of its performance. This underlines the pressure on Britain\u2019s supermarkets: They are attempting to adapt to changes in shopping habits that have led to customers spending more money with the discounters, in convenience stores and online, rather than simply buying their food in one weekly shop. However, the results at Sainsbury\u2019s are better than feared, with the retailer formally upgrading its expectations for the financial year just over a month ago. The company\u2019s pre-tax profits of \u00a3339m are way ahead of rivals Tesco and Morrisons, and far better than the \u00a3290m loss it reported this time last year when Sainsbury\u2019s wrote off the value of underperforming supermarkets. Sainsbury\u2019s is well-placed for the Christmas season. It traditionally gains market share in holiday seasons owing to the strong reputation of its fresh food. But it is likely to be boosted further this year because in the period before last Christmas it reduced prices and angered customers by cutting the points they were awarded on their Nectar reward cards. This means Sainsbury\u2019s will be comparing its sales against a weaker period last year, and its like-for-like sales figure should benefit as a result. Asda The budget retailer has made headlines for drastically scaling back its participation in Black Friday. It said this was in response to feedback from customers, many of whom would prefer Asda cut the price of food and drink rather than offer one-off discounts on electrical items. However, cynics say it is an attempt by Asda and its US parent company, Walmart, to protect the supermarket\u2019s profits. Asda reported a 4.7% fall in sales at established stores in the three months to 30 June, the worst performance in its 50-year history, amid fierce competition from the discounters and its rivals slashing prices and issuing millions of discount vouchers. It is unclear how much this performance is due to Asda genuinely struggling or Walmart, the biggest retailer in the world, demanding that the retailer protects its profits rather than get dragged into a price war. Asda was the first of the big four to recognise the rise of Aldi and Lidl and launch a fightback. In late 2013, it committed \u00a31bn to cutting prices and revamping shops over the next five years. However, in a sign that Asda is concerned about its performance, last month it overhauled that five-year plan, announcing it would make further price cuts, accelerate improvements to its largest shops, delay the opening of new smaller shops in London and scrap plans to build more click and collect sites for online orders. Morrisons David Potts was appointed chief executive of Morrisons in February in an attempt to help the struggling Bradford-based supermarket return to the basics. Critics argue that former boss Dalton Philips alienated core shoppers by trying to take the retailer upmarket, for example by installing in-store misting machines to cool the fruit and vegetables. Philips said this was not the case, insisting that Morrisons needed to modernise to meet the demands of its shoppers, particularly in the south-east and London. He said it also needed emphasise the fact it made much of its own products and was one of the UK\u2019s biggest food manufacturers. Philips suggested Morrisons was struggling because it entered the fast-growing online grocery market and convenience store sector later than its rivals. Potts aims to get Morrisons back on track by tailoring the products in each supermarket to the demands of the local community, adding 5,000 staff to stores, making the company\u2019s pricing and promotions simpler, and introducing in-store services such as mobile phone repairs. He has also closed shops and sold off the fledging M Local convenience store brand. However, Christmas will still be tough. Morrisons said like-for-like sales were down 2.6% in the 13 weeks to 1 November, mirroring a miserable performance in the same period last year. Tesco Britain\u2019s biggest retailer also has the sector\u2019s biggest problems. It is more than year since new its boss, Dave Lewis, arrived and a major accounting scandal was uncovered. However, despite the chief executive\u2019s drive to cut prices, improve customer service, and close more than 50 struggling shops, Tesco remains in decline. The company\u2019s latest results showed a 1.1% fall in like-for-like sales in the UK, which is a smaller decline than Sainsbury\u2019s. However, operating profits were just \u00a3166m. To put that into context, Sainsbury\u2019s is making almost double the profit despite generating almost half the sales \u2013 \u00a312.4bn compared with Tesco\u2019s \u00a321.6bn. This means that Tesco is throwing money at trying to win back sales, but with limited impact. Tesco still has more than 3,500 stores in the UK, far more than Sainsbury\u2019s 1,200. Lewis revealed this week that between 2007 and 2014 Tesco opened 35m sq ft of new shop space, the equivalent of twice the size of Asda today, but that group sales have gone nowhere during that time. As a consequence, Tesco is more exposed to the impact of changing shopping habits than its rivals. This, coupled with the damage to the Tesco brand, a Serious Fraud Office investigation into the accounting scandal, billions of pounds of debt, and poor staff morale due to the scrapping of the company\u2019s final salary pension scheme and job losses, means turning around the famous retailer will take years. Lewis appears to be braced for a tough Christmas. Tesco enjoyed a better sales performance than its rivals in the 2014 festive season as the new boss enjoyed a honeymoon period. However, this was underpinned by issuing millions of money-off vouchers to shoppers and offering sharp discounts on Black Friday, which led to police being called to stores. Lewis says the company will not be repeating some of the tactics it used last year and will have to hold firm through what could be a testing time.",

The company\u2019s pre-tax profits of \u00a3339m are way ahead of rivals Tesco and Morrisons, and far better than the \u00a3290m loss it reported this time last year when Sainsbury\u2019s wrote off the value of underperforming supermarkets.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s is well-placed for the Christmas season. It traditionally gains market share in holiday seasons owing to the strong reputation of its fresh food. But it is likely to be boosted further this year because in the period before last Christmas it reduced prices and angered customers by cutting the points they were awarded on their Nectar reward cards. This means Sainsbury\u2019s will be comparing its sales against a weaker period last year, and its like-for-like sales figure should benefit as a result.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/asda\">Asda</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"779e49ba7db55588a216080f36409f9733a8a58f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/779e49ba7db55588a216080f36409f9733a8a58f/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shoppers gather outside the Asda store in Wembley, north-west London, on Black Friday last year.

It said this was in response to feedback from customers, many of whom would prefer Asda cut the price of food and drink rather than offer one-off discounts on electrical items.</p> <p>However, cynics say it is an attempt by Asda and its US parent company, Walmart, to protect the supermarket\u2019s profits. Asda reported a 4.7% fall in sales at established stores in the three months to 30 June, the worst performance in its 50-year history, amid fierce competition from the discounters and its rivals slashing prices and issuing millions of discount vouchers.</p> <p>It is unclear how much this performance is due to Asda genuinely struggling or Walmart, the biggest retailer in the world, demanding that the retailer protects its profits rather than get dragged into a price war. </p> <p>Asda was the first of the big four to recognise the rise of Aldi and Lidl and launch a fightback. In late 2013, it committed \u00a31bn to cutting prices and revamping shops over the next five years. However, in a sign that Asda is concerned about its performance, last month it overhauled that five-year plan, announcing it would make further price cuts, accelerate improvements to its largest shops, delay the opening of new smaller shops in London and scrap plans to build more click and collect sites for online orders.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/morrisons\">Morrisons</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44a0dc968b649edae56ccf6650c1c417a2a974d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44a0dc968b649edae56ccf6650c1c417a2a974d1/0_255_3200_1921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morrisons\u2019 new chief plans to tailor the products in each supermarket to the demands of the local community.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morrisons\u2019 new chief plans to tailor the products in each supermarket to the demands of the local community.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>David Potts was appointed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/16/david-potts-first-day-ceo-morrisons-northern-supermarket\">chief executive of Morrisons</a> in February in an attempt to help the struggling Bradford-based supermarket return to the basics.</p> <p>Critics argue that former boss Dalton Philips alienated core shoppers by trying to take the retailer upmarket, for example by installing in-store misting machines to cool the fruit and vegetables. Philips said this was not the case, insisting that Morrisons needed to modernise to meet the demands of its shoppers, particularly in the south-east and London. He said it also needed emphasise the fact it made much of its own products and was one of the UK\u2019s biggest food manufacturers. </p> <p>Philips suggested Morrisons was struggling because it entered the fast-growing online grocery market and convenience store sector later than its rivals.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/10/morrisons-closures-and-waitrose-decline-underline-food-shoppings-revolution\">Potts aims to get Morrisons back on track</a> by tailoring the products in each supermarket to the demands of the local community, adding 5,000 staff to stores, making the company\u2019s pricing and promotions simpler, and introducing in-store services such as mobile phone repairs. He has also closed shops and sold off the fledging M Local convenience store brand.</p> <p>However, Christmas will still be tough.

It is more than year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/31/tesco-rescue-has-dave-lewiss-first-year-been-a-success\">since new its boss, Dave Lewis, arrived</a> and a major accounting scandal was uncovered. However, despite the chief executive\u2019s drive to cut prices, improve customer service, and close more than 50 struggling shops, Tesco remains in decline.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/07/tesco-profits-more-than-halved\">The company\u2019s latest results</a> showed a 1.1% fall in like-for-like sales in the UK, which is a smaller decline than Sainsbury\u2019s. However, operating profits were just \u00a3166m. To put that into context, Sainsbury\u2019s is making almost double the profit despite generating almost half the sales \u2013 \u00a312.4bn compared with Tesco\u2019s \u00a321.6bn. This means that Tesco is throwing money at trying to win back sales, but with limited impact. </p> <p>Tesco still has more than 3,500 stores in the UK, far more than Sainsbury\u2019s 1,200. Lewis revealed this week that between 2007 and 2014 Tesco opened 35m sq ft of new shop space, the equivalent of twice the size of Asda today, but that group sales have gone nowhere during that time. As a consequence, Tesco is more exposed to the impact of changing shopping habits than its rivals.</p> <p>This, coupled with the damage to the Tesco brand, a Serious Fraud Office investigation into the accounting scandal, billions of pounds of debt, and poor staff morale due to the scrapping of the company\u2019s final salary pension scheme and job losses, means turning around the famous retailer will take years.</p> <p>Lewis appears to be braced for a tough Christmas. Tesco enjoyed a better sales performance than its rivals in the 2014 festive season as the new boss enjoyed a honeymoon period. However, this was underpinned by issuing millions of money-off vouchers to shoppers and offering sharp discounts on Black Friday, which led to police being called to stores. Lewis says the company will not be repeating some of the tactics it used last year and will have to hold firm through what could be a testing time.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pay growth for Britain\u2019s workers appears to be slowing sharply, raising questions about the durability of the recent improvement in living standards. Official figures published on Wednesday showed the labour market remained healthy in the three months to September, with the employment rate hitting a record high of 73.7%, and the unemployment rate sliding to 5.3%, its lowest level for more than seven years. However, earnings growth has weakened. On a three-monthly basis, regular wages, excluding bonuses, grew at an annual rate of 2.5% in the three months to September, down from 2.8% in the three months to August. Including bonuses, wage growth was unchanged, at 3%. Looking at the more volatile monthly data, the deterioration was more marked, with regular pay growth slipping to just 1.9%, the weakest since January. With inflation at -0.1%, driven by the continuing weakness in commodity prices, real wages are rising at a healthy rate; but take-home pay remains well below pre-crisis levels, and the slowdown raised concerns about what would happen once inflation starts to pick up again. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, described the data as \u201cespecially worrying, given that the government is about to announce severe cuts, which will reduce demand across the economy, making pay growth harder to maintain\u201d. Over the past year, almost three quarters of the jobs created have gone to non-UK nationals, predominantly from inside the EU, according to the Office for National Statistics, a fact that is likely to sharpen the debate about free movement as David Cameron seeks to renegotiate Britain\u2019s relationship with Brussels. The number of UK nationals in jobs jumped by 122,000 in a year, to 28.09 million, the ONS said; while the number of non-UK nationals working in the UK increased by 326,000, to 3.22 million. The Bank of England\u2019s monthly report from its local agents up and down the country, also published on Wednesday, offered separate evidence of weakness, saying that while pay pressure was building in some sectors, \u201chiring intentions had eased, alongside slower demand growth and an increasing focus on raising productivity\u201d. Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said improvements in productivity would be the key to generating wage rises in the coming months. \u201cThe good news is that signs of a return to productivity growth should generate more upward pay pressure. That will be particularly important once inflation starts to rise.\u201d The rapid improvement in the labour market has been one of the strongest features of Britain\u2019s economic recovery in recent years. Nick Palmer, of the ONS, said: \u201cThese figures continue the recent strengthening trend in the labour market, with a new record high in the employment rate and the unemployment rate still at its lowest since spring 2008.\u201d George Osborne, keen to cement his reputation for economic management amid the tax credits controversy, said the figures were \u201cexcellent news\u201d. The chancellor added: \u201cAt 73.7% our employment rate has never been higher and we are moving towards the goal of full employment that I set out a year ago.\u201d However the weakening of pay growth is likely to undermine the argument of anti-inflation hawks on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, who have argued that interest rates should rise to prevent wage growth running out of control. John Philpott, of the Jobs Economist consultancy firm, said: \u201cWhile we can continue to take comfort in the general health of the UK employment situation there is nothing in these latest data to support the kind of \u2018overheating labour market\u2019 narrative that might be used to suggest the Bank of England should start to raise interest rates sooner rather than later.\u201d",

On a three-monthly basis, regular wages, excluding bonuses, grew at an annual rate of 2.5% in the three months to September, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/14/unemployment-wage-rises-figures-ons-george-osborne\">down from 2.8% in the three months to August</a>. Including bonuses, wage growth was unchanged, at 3%.</p> <p>Looking at the more volatile monthly data, the deterioration was more marked, with regular pay growth slipping to just 1.9%, the weakest since January.</p> <p>With <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/13/uk-inflations-dips-below-zero\">inflation at -0.1%</a>, driven by the continuing weakness in commodity prices, real wages are rising at a healthy rate; but take-home pay remains well below pre-crisis levels, and the slowdown raised concerns about what would happen once inflation starts to pick up again.</p> <p>Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, described the data as \u201cespecially worrying, given that the government is about to announce severe cuts, which will reduce demand across the economy, making pay growth harder to maintain\u201d.</p> <p>Over the past year, almost three quarters of the jobs created have gone to non-UK nationals, predominantly from inside the EU, according to the Office for National Statistics, a fact that is likely to sharpen the debate about free movement as David Cameron seeks to renegotiate Britain\u2019s relationship with Brussels. </p> <p>The number of UK nationals in jobs jumped by 122,000 in a year, to 28.09 million, the ONS said; while the number of non-UK nationals working in the UK increased by 326,000, to 3.22 million.</p> <p>The Bank of England\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/agentssummary/2015/nov.pdf\">monthly report</a> from its local agents up and down the country, also published on Wednesday, offered separate evidence of weakness, saying that while pay pressure was building in some sectors, \u201chiring intentions had eased, alongside slower demand growth and an increasing focus on raising productivity\u201d.</p> <p>Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said improvements in productivity would be the key to generating wage rises in the coming months. \u201cThe good news is that signs of a return to productivity growth should generate more upward pay pressure.

Nick Palmer, of the ONS, said: \u201cThese figures continue the recent strengthening trend in the labour market, with a new record high in the employment rate and the unemployment rate still at its lowest since spring 2008.\u201d</p> <p>George Osborne, keen to cement his reputation for economic management amid the tax credits controversy, said the figures were \u201cexcellent news\u201d. The chancellor added: \u201cAt 73.7% our employment rate has never been higher and we are moving towards the goal of full employment <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/31/george-osborne-full-employment-britain-inflation\">that I set out a year ago</a>.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p><br></p> <p>However the weakening of pay growth is likely to undermine the argument of anti-inflation hawks on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/05/interest-rate-bank-of-england-leave-record-low-decision\">Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee</a>, who have argued that interest rates should rise to prevent wage growth running out of control. </p> <p>John Philpott, of the Jobs Economist consultancy firm, said: \u201cWhile we can continue to take comfort in the general health of the UK employment situation there is nothing in these latest data to support the kind of \u2018overheating labour market\u2019 narrative that might be used to suggest the Bank of England should start to raise interest rates sooner rather than later.\u201d</p>",

Its shares are down 46p at \u00a319.29, with analysts remaining unconvinced by the outlook for the company. Many of it City clientele will face cost pressures when new regulations on price transparency - including how much brokers pay for research - come into force (albeit a new delay means this could take another year from now). Andrew Darley, tech analyst at finnCap moved from hold to sell and cut his price target from \u00a323 to \u00a317.50. He said: Fidessa\u2019s equity markets position is strong and generates cash as a mature, subscription-based software model should. However, the forthcoming disruption to the predominantly sell-side customer base still looms large. Forays into already well served derivatives and fixed income markets will not be sufficient to provide material net growth. While there is a risk our call may be early, since the supportive dividend is attractive (albeit uncovered), the 25 times PE rating remains eye-watering for a stock with negligible growth since 2011, where potential catalysts all appear negative. George O\u2019Connor at Panmure Gordon said: Whilst there are some sparks of hope our over-riding impression is that Fidessa is only a few paces ahead of weak competitors and markets. We were partly disappointed - the last time Fidessa did a capital markets day was 2008 - so much has changed since. Fidessa has the potential to rock the global fintech (as opposed to cash equities) market but its new ventures falter (it still doesn\u2019t know what to do in Fixed Income and Derivatives, and is three years from profitability). The company is concentrating on its financial \u2018returns strategy\u2019 - ie the special dividend - but here investors have better choices, such as (say) Micro Focus (buy) and Computacenter (buy). We are pleased that with individuals like Steve Grob, the strategy guy, there is true vision. More parochially, news of a potential delay on [new regulations] MiFID II should impact estimates as hard-pressed customers are able to hold off non-recurring spend (we downgrade a smidgen). Fidessa repeated the more upbeat note from its last trading update. In the wake of the meeting we are less of the view that Fidessa is stuck and is incapable of innovation, but it struggles to enter co-related markets. On balance, and to reflect a more positive view, we increase our target price to 1712p (from 1587p). Shares are too expensive to purchase, hence we retain our hold. And Julian Yates at Investec said: The Capital Markets Day gave an upbeat outlook for the very long term evolution of the business, potentially broadening out derivatives, fixed income, buy-side sales to match their respective shares of the current financial markets and delivering around \u00a31.2bn sales. However, we believe this will likely require additional investment and it could limit leverage (derivatives will take 7 years from first win to hit profitability). Lack of profit progression keeps us at hold with the dividend being the main valuation support.",

Sales rose 20.7% to \u00a32.5bn between July and November, prompting the company to make a record dividend payment of more than \u00a3200m to shareholders. It is holding its annual meeting in London on Wednesday afternoon. Barratt said it was seeing high levels of demand across all regions. Last week, York-based housebuilder Persimmon said the third quarter had been an \u201cextremely busy time\u201d for the company, when it reported a 12% increase in sales to \u00a3780m. Another builder, Bellway, posted a 44% jump in full-year profits to \u00a3354m last month, better than expected. Davy analyst Colin Sheridan said Barratt\u2019s figures showed \u201cfurther evidence of a very strong autumn selling season in the UK\u201d. The industry has been the beneficiary of the government\u2019s help-to-buy scheme, which has been extended until 2020 and is aimed at helping first-time buyers into the market. Barratt said it was supporting the government on its starter homes scheme, which has set out to provide 200,000 homes for first-time buyers over the next five years. David Thomas, the company\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cAgainst the backdrop of a significant structural shortage of new homes in Britain, we have made a strong start to the year.\u201d However, the company has scaled back new developments and hirings. It launched 49 developments \u2013 down from 80 at this stage last year \u2013 and now operates from 380 sites, compared with 395 last year. Barratt said there were still shortages of skilled labour in some trades and locations. It hired 327 new graduates, trainees and apprentices this year and is recruiting another 250 for the next financial year. Barratt\u2019s shares slipped 1.6% to 566.32p in early trading on Wednesday. Analyst Charlie Campbell at Liberum said last week after the Persimmon update: \u201cValuations for the three largest UK housebuilders (Barratt, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey) are too stretched to accommodate any bad news on future gross margins. \u201cIt is our view that house price inflation in future is likely to moderate as affordability is stretched and that the FPC [the bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee] can keep a lid on house price inflation through its role as overseer of UK mortgage lending standards.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Despite more weak data from China - this time industrial production and retail sales - as well as concerns about a US rate rise in December and renewed problems in Greece and Portugal, leading shares are recovering in early trading after four days of decline. In China, industrial production in October fell from 5.7% the previous month to 5.6% while retail sales disappointed despite an 11% rise. But this was by no means a disaster, and investors seemed unfazed by it. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: We\u2019re picking up some modest gains in early trade for the FTSE-100 with a strong finish on Wall Street last night and no great surprises in the Chinese data helping serve up a little positive sentiment shortly after the open. So the FTSE 100 is currently up 38.88 points at 6314.16, as UK data showed the highest employment rate on record and weekly earnings up 2.5% in the three months to September, slightly lower than the 2.7% expected. This backs up the recent dovish tone on interest rates from the Bank of England. Brenda Kelly, head analyst at London Capital Group, said: The average wage index was a mite lighter than expected at 3% growth against the consensus for a 3.2% lift \u2013 there may be signs that this metric is losing momentum and could vindicate the lack of action form the Bank of England. The pound has pulled back some of its intraday gains against the dollar as a result and now trades at 1.5138 following a high of 1.5185 earlier. UK 10 year gilts are little changed. But housebuilder shares are falling despite a positive trading update from Barratt Developments, which said market conditions remained strong with high levels of consumer demand across all regions. With some profit taking, the shares are down 6.5p at 569p, while Persimmon has lost 22p to \u00a318.53. On Barratt, Robin Hardy of Shore Capital said: Our fair value estimate remains at 550p and we remain concerned still about: the group\u2019s ability to continue to run with so high of level of \u2018land creditors\u2019 (almost \u00a31bn at the last year end); the still relatively low return on invested capital if calculated on average debt (still much higher than period end) and including land creditors \u2013 after tax, returns will be just 14% in 2016. Consensus sell-side recommendations continue to roll towards the negative with now 2 sells, 8 holds and 5 buyers. We remain at hold (not more negative because of high yields) but would still be talking profits despite the recent fall. Miners continue there recent weakness following the Chinese data, with BHP Billiton down 6.7p at 939.8p. Heading the other way is Experian, up 34p at \u00a312.21 in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s results as Citigroup raised its target price by 9% to \u00a313.40 with a buy rating.

      "body": "<p>Despite more weak data from China - this time industrial production and retail sales - as well as concerns about a US rate rise in December and renewed problems in Greece and Portugal, leading shares are recovering in early trading after four days of decline.</p> <p>In China, industrial production in October fell from 5.7% the previous month to 5.6% while retail sales disappointed despite an 11% rise. But this was by no means a disaster, and investors seemed unfazed by it. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019re picking up some modest gains in early trade for the FTSE-100 with a strong finish on Wall Street last night and no great surprises in the Chinese data helping serve up a little positive sentiment shortly after the open. </p> </blockquote> <p>So the<strong> FTSE 100</strong> is currently up 38.88 points at 6314.16, as UK data showed the highest employment rate on record and weekly earnings up 2.5% in the three months to September, slightly lower than the 2.7% expected. This backs up the recent dovish tone on interest rates from the Bank of England. Brenda Kelly, head analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The average wage index was a mite lighter than expected at 3% growth against the consensus for a 3.2% lift \u2013 there may be signs that this metric is losing momentum and could vindicate the lack of action form the Bank of England.</p> </blockquote> <p>The pound has pulled back some of its intraday gains against the dollar as a result and now trades at 1.5138 following a high of 1.5185 earlier. UK 10 year gilts are little changed. </p> <p>But housebuilder shares are falling despite a positive trading update from <strong>Barratt Developments</strong>, which said market conditions remained strong with high levels of consumer demand across all regions. With some profit taking, the shares are down 6.5p at 569p, while <strong>Persimmon </strong>has lost 22p to \u00a318.53. On Barratt, Robin Hardy of Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our fair value estimate remains at 550p and we remain concerned still about: the group\u2019s ability to continue to run with so high of level of \u2018land creditors\u2019 (almost \u00a31bn at the last year end); the still relatively low return on invested capital if calculated on average debt (still much higher than period end) and including land creditors \u2013 after tax, returns will be just 14% in 2016. Consensus sell-side recommendations continue to roll towards the negative with now 2 sells, 8 holds and 5 buyers. We remain at hold (not more negative because of high yields) but would still be talking profits despite the recent fall. </p> </blockquote> <p> Miners continue there recent weakness following the Chinese data, with <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> down 6.7p at 939.8p.</p> <p>Heading the other way is <strong>Experian</strong>, up 34p at \u00a312.21 in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s results as Citigroup raised its target price by 9% to \u00a313.40 with a buy rating.</p> <p><strong>SABMiller</strong> has jumped 96.5p to 4072.5p as ABInBev launched a $100bn bid and agreed to sell SAB\u2019s stake in joint venture MillerCoors to smooth the regulatory path.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, <strong>TalkTalk</strong> is up 26.7p at 244p as it revealed the recent cyber attack would cost it \u00a330m to \u00a335m.</p> <p><strong>Icap</strong> has added 28.8p to 500.5p as it sold its global voice broking and information business for \u00a31.11bn to rival <strong>Tullett Prebon</strong>, down 24p at 335p.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A massive one-day online shopping event in China on Wednesday, known as \u201csingles day\u201d, has been blamed for an unprecedented shortage of baby formula in Australian supermarkets, with premium and organic brands most affected. Thousands of sellers can be found hawking Bellamy\u2019s Organic baby formula products on Taobao, China\u2019s answer to eBay, where prices for a tin of the company\u2019s organic toddler milk drink range from 160 yuan (A$35) to about 250 yuan (more than A$55). Chinese tourists, students and relatives living in Australia had been bulk-buying the products throughout October to sell on Taobao and other Chinese websites ready for the singles day shopping frenzy, Bellamy\u2019s Organic chairman, Rob Woolley, told media this week. One Chinese online salesman claimed his seven-month-old baby had suffered from repeated outbreaks of diarrhoea until he began giving the child Bellamy\u2019s formula. \u201cEverything is normal with him [now],\u201d he wrote. Another Australia-based Chinese saleswoman said she had stocks of the Australian formula waiting to be delivered from a warehouse in mainland China. \u201cEach customer can only buy three tins,\u201d she said. A third Taobao seller told customers that even on the Chinese internet, Bellamy\u2019s products were increasingly hard to find. \u201cIt\u2019s organic, so it is better,\u201d the seller wrote. \u201cBut recently we have been running out of stock.\u201d A distrust of Chinese-manufactured formula began in late 2008, when the Chinese ministry of health revealed almost 300,000 babies had fallen ill and six had died after drinking baby formula deliberately laced with the chemical melamine. The toxic chemical, used in plastics and fertiliser, was added to the formula by unscrupulous manufacturers to mask low protein levels in watered down formula. Chinese manufacturers have since struggled to regain the market\u2019s trust. Buyers turned to New Zealand, Australia and Britain in droves, leading to sporadic shortages in those countries over the past seven years as tourists and relatives bulk-bought the formula to take home with them or to send to China. Supermarkets and pharmacies in those countries have largely managed to meet demand by temporarily limiting the number of tins consumers could buy while formula manufacturers increased their production. But in the past few weeks, Australian parents have found supermarkets completely out of organic and premium brands of baby formula, such as Bellamy\u2019s Organic, Aptamil Gold and A2 Platinum. As newer entrants in the baby formula market, A2 Platinum and Bellamy\u2019s have found it difficult to quickly ramp up production to meet demand. While both companies have distributors in China, chief executive of the A2 Milk Company, Peter Nathan, said Chinese parents were still fearful of buying from within their own country. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that there has been a shortage for some time, but that the shortage is a little bit more severe in the last couple of months than it has been,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cThe Chinese have a very positive brand perception for products that are sold in Australia, and they like brands that are both premium-priced and premium in quality. Our research clearly demonstrates that many Chinese prefer to buy a product retailed in Australia from a friend or relative that they trust, and our brand awareness is growing in China which is also driving growth.\u201d He hoped that over the next couple of years Chinese buyers would begin to trust online retailers and local suppliers selling the A2 range rather than relying on relatives in Australia to buy it. Like Bellamy\u2019s and Danone Nutricia, the company is also ramping up production, and is also considering opening a plant in Australia to complement its New Zealand operation. Meanwhile, a message on the Bellamy\u2019s Organic website said it expected stock levels to return to normal in Australian supermarkets by the end of November. The deputy director at the University of Technology\u2019s Australia-China Relations Institute (UTS), Professor James Laurenceson, said Chinese parents preferred premium brands. \u201cThis is all heightened by the [recently scrapped] one-child policy,\u201d Laurenceson said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s just one kid, of course their parents will do all they can to make sure that kid has a good start to life, and so the incentive is to buy products for that kid overseas, and to also buy the most premium brands.\u201d The shortage has left Australian parents outraged. While there have been several sporadic shortages in recent years, photos of shoppers buying baby formula in bulk shared on social media in the past few days have led to a public outcry. Coles supermarkets have imposed a four-tin limit on customers, while Woolworths has long had an eight-tin limit in place. However, it was up to individual Woolworths stores whether to impose the limit, a spokesman said. Shoppers took to the store\u2019s Facebook page this week to share their images and stories of bulk-buying. One woman, Bree Lymar, wrote: \u201cI have pictures of shoppers buying trolleys full of formula at my local Sydney store.\u201d \u201cThey cleared out the whole stock,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI asked for one tin and they wouldn\u2019t give me one. This is getting beyond a joke.\u201d Another customer, Eleanor Menadue, wrote she saw a customer \u201cwith her trolley full and the staff helping her through the self-serve checkout\u201d. However, not all brands were out of stock. Director of paediatrics at Queensland\u2019s Gold Coast hospital, Associate Professor Susan Moloney, said Australian parents should not be afraid to switch brands while they waited for the preferred product to return to the shelves. Parents have shared stories on Facebook of driving to several supermarkets or going out of town to find a store stocking their preferred brand. But Moloney said this was unnecessary. \u201cAs long as the child hasn\u2019t been prescribed a specific formula by their doctor, it\u2019s fine to swap brands,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re really all very much the same, and the differences between formulas are very minor.\u201d She advised her patients to buy the formula that was cheapest and easiest to find, rather than spend money on organic or premium brands. \u201cI think there\u2019s enough infant formula being produced around Australia to fulfil our requirements,\u201d she said. Most brands of formula are still available to buy online even if the products are not available in stores. Minister assisting the minister for trade and investment, Senator Richard Colbeck, told ABC Radio on Wednesday the federal government was working hard to attract investment in Australia\u2019s dairy industry so both local and overseas demand for products such as baby formula could be met. \u201cIt\u2019s something we are going to have to have a conversation about within government so that we can ensure local people get supply, but so that we can also meet a very, very important export market,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I think, is going to continue to drive demand.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In the ongoing saga of Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s financial fortunes, fashion is often said to be the canary in the coalmine. The theory is that the ability of M&amp;S to make the hearts of its core female customer sing \u2013 as it did with the pink coat (September 2013) and the suede midiskirt (May 2015) \u2013 is a crucial sign of good health for the M&amp;S business as a whole. The trouble with this theory is that despite consistently strong reviews from fashion critics in the three years since Belinda Earl became style director \u2013 and despite, even, the pink coat and the suede midiskirt \u2013 clothing sales have now declined for 16 out of the past 17 quarters. So the canary parallel is starting to feel a little tenuous, or at the very least an overly simplistic way to look at a very complicated business picture. (While sales are declining, profit margins are slightly up, so the picture for investors is brighter than the headlines suggest.) And \u2013 let\u2019s be honest \u2013 the coalmine analogy is not the most auspicious way to portray a giant of British economy and culture battling to stay relevant in the modern world. But M&amp;S continues to pin high hopes on fashion as a business strategy, as evidenced by the recent promotion of Queralt Ferrer, an extremely chic Spaniard who was previously head of design for the premium Autograph and Best of British labels, to overall responsibility for design. Ferrar comes from a strong business background \u2013 in Madrid she was at Inditex, owners of Zara \u2013 but it is her sophisticated, refined, understated aesthetic that stands out in the world of high street traders. I asked Earl why it is that her team persist with the fanfare around press days when the facts suggest that a positive response from fashion editors does not in fact translate into a booming bottom line. \u201cWe feel we are getting the clothes right, and what we need to do now is take what happens at these press days right down the chain,\u201d she said. \u201cDown the chain\u201d is M&amp;S speak for the hundreds of minor stores that are nothing like the Marble Arch flagship at all, and is a key issue for the company. I buy and wear a lot of Marks &amp; Spencer clothes \u2013 today, as it happens, I am wearing a pair of oxblood patent leather ankle boots I bought last winter \u2013 but I am aware, from the surprised reactions I generally get when I explain that a complimented piece is M&amp;S, that my success rate on the M&amp;S shopfloor is far from universal. \u201cWe need to buy more of the really great pieces,\u201d says trading director Jo Jenkins. \u201cGet the look into all the smaller stores. We\u2019ve learnt a lot from the suede skirt. This season we\u2019ve got a \u00a3200 leather wrap skirt, and a \u00a3200 leather skirt isn\u2019t for everyone, but we need to translate that style in more accessible versions for all our customers.\u201d Successes like the suede skirt, says Earl, \u201cgive us fashion authority, and that\u2019s an asset\u201d. The M&amp;S team have a habit of referring to their customer in the third person singular, as if she had just popped out of the room to put the kettle on. \u201cShe loves a mannequin,\u201d Karen Peacock, head of M&amp;S Collection and Indigo, will say, asked how the customer is responding to the increased number of styled-up store dummies designed to show how the clothes work together. \u201cShe\u2019s getting there,\u201d says Ferrer sagely, when quizzed on whether the M&amp;S woman has embraced the new season\u2019s longer skirt lengths. Also, I notice that the team hardly ever use the words \u2018trend\u2019 or \u2018catwalk\u2019 or even \u2018season\u2019. Instead, they talk about the importance of being \u2018contemporary\u2019 and of \u2018key pieces\u2019. The philosophy behind this \u2013 a grown-up perspective on style, rather than the literal-mindedness of fast-fashion \u2013 seems sensible but it is in fact a commercial gamble, as it relies on the customer picking up on more subtle signposting. Ferrer is gripped with fervour as she strokes the nub of an unstructured beige sleeveless suede summer jacket to show me the softness, but the average customer, with three minutes to shop for herself in between the school uniform and food departments, might not spot its appeal. There are a few catwalk references that pop from the showroom floor. Look out for metallic pleated midi skirts (Gucci) and shoulder-frilled cotton blouses (Miu Miu); a geometric handbag (very Loewe), a black and white gingham shirtdress (hello Victoria Beckham) and embroidered bomber jackets (Versus). But the best pieces are those which have a more tangential take on fashion. I loved the aforementioned \u00a3199 leather wrap skirt \u2013 and the \u00a355 version, in matt silver. Also a bell-shaped jacquard skirt which looks a million dollars and costs \u00a349.50, and a \u2018cold-shoulder\u2019 black jersey dress from Limited Collection, which channels vintage Donna Karan for \u00a325.",

      "bodyText": "Almost one in 10 beds in Britain\u2019s care homes will disappear in the next five years because of the financial crisis facing the sector, leaving the NHS to pick up a \u00a33bn bill, a damning new report predicts. As many as 37,000 beds, the equivalent of about 1,500 care homes, could be lost by 2020, according to the thinktank ResPublica. Elderly residents would have to stay in hospitals instead, the report says, where they would take up one in four beds. The findings underline the scale of the problems facing the care home sector and the potential cost to the NHS. Leading operators have already said they will close or sell homes if the chancellor fails to provide more funding in his autumn statement. Care homes are being squeezed by a fall in the fees that local authorities contribute to residents\u2019 care and a rise in staff costs. The latter will increase further when the \u201cnational living wage\u201d comes into force next April. The ResPublica report, which is backed by the GMB trade union, says the care home industry will have a shortfall in funding of \u00a31.1bn by the 2020/21 financial year, with \u00a3382m linked to the costs associated with the introduction of the national living wage. It says the industry can no longer cope with the failure of a major operator, as it did in 2011 when Southern Cross, the country\u2019s biggest care home group, collapsed and rival operators took control of its homes. ResPublica\u2019s director, Phillip Blond, said: \u201cWhen Southern Cross failed, the private sector stepped in and cared for those left homeless. \u201cNow, however, with the sector losing money for every funded resident, there is no provider of last resort. We fear the worst case scenario is the most likely, that these residents will flood our local general hospitals costing \u00a33bn per year by 2020. \u201cThe national living wage must be brought in. It is essential working people are paid a proper wage. At the same time it will damage the residential care sector, which is already under extreme pressure, and it could collapse as a result.\u201d Trade unions and care home bosses have also urged the government to take action. Over-65s currently make up 18% of the population, but the figure will rise to 25% by 2050, putting more pressure on the system. The report says local authority spending on social care for older people has already fallen by 17% in real terms in the last five years. Justin Bowden, the GMB\u2019s national officer, said: \u201cIt is one minute to midnight for the care sector.

This has been a slow motion collapse and somebody\u2019s mum or dad or granny, our elderly and vulnerable, will be the biggest victims.\u201d There are currently 425,000 people in 18,000 care homes across the UK. Writing in the Guardian, Guy Hands, the chairman of the private equity group Terra Firma, warned of the \u201cpotentially disastrous collective impact\u201d of government policies such as the national living wage and funding cuts for local authorities. Terra Firma owns Four Seasons, now the country\u2019s biggest care home group, which is \u00a3500m in debt. Hands said, however, that the company could cope, and that the crisis facing the sector was not the operators\u2019 fault. \u201cMore elderly people who could enjoy their last years of life in comfortable and caring surroundings will instead be forced into hospital, which is distressing for them and expensive for the taxpayer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are also going to see, as is already happening, a growing divide in quality between those homes providing private care \u2013 where fees have increased by 10% over the last five years \u2013 and those largely caring for residents financed by local authorities. \u201cIt will make it much harder, for example, for businesses like Four Seasons, which offers an industry-leading dementia programme, to remain in the vanguard of improving care. \u201cContinuing to squeeze residential fees will prove to be a false economy and cause anguish for those who need care.
