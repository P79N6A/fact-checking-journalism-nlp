      "bodyText": "There is more fuel for the raging debate around UK interest rates this week, with official figures on pay growth out on Wednesday. Investors and policymakers alike are looking for any signs that a tight labour market can translate into faster pay growth, a trend that has so far proved elusive this year. If wages do start to get going again, the pound is likely to rally as traders price in a greater chance of a 2017 interest rate rise. This month marks a whole decade since the Bank of England last raised borrowing costs. Since then, the only way has been down and interest rates are currently at a record low of 0.25%. But that could be about to change if the latest noises from Threadneedle Street\u2019s policymakers are anything to go by \u2013 with the obvious health warning that previous hints of rate hikes have come to nothing. At the last rate-setting meeting in June, three policymakers voted for an immediate rate rise to 0.5%, which would remove some of the emergency stimulus the Bank injected into the economy after the Brexit vote. The other five members of the monetary policy committee outvoted the hawks, however, preferring to leave the base rate at 0.25% to shore up the economy after a slow start to 2017. But more recently, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, and the governor Mark Carney have suggested they may be more amenable to higher rates. Sparks may fly at M&amp;S AGM as chair bows out After six years as chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer, Robert Swannell will take to the podium at an AGM for the final time on Tuesday. The former investment banker will retire in September at a tumultuous time for the retailer. In May, the retailer reported a drop in profits of almost two-thirds at the same time as a turnaround plan by chief executive Steve Rowe brought in a bill of more than \u00a3400m in restructuring costs. Rowe has insisted that M&amp;S is on track for recovery, despite worsening performances in clothing and food. Not that this will be the only thing likely to irk the shareholders, known for taking their opportunity at AGMs to vent their grievances over every facet of the company\u2019s operations. The last few years have seen shareholders protest about the appointment system for bra fitting, the type of music played in stores (\u201cwould the board at least consider changing the irritating songs to something more tranquil?\u201d) and where best to find a cotton dress with sleeves and a high line suitable for \u201cgolden oldies\u201d. A number of questions have focused on socks \u2013 one specifically about why they fall to pieces \u201cwhen you look at them\u201d, according to one shareholder, although this claim was rejected by the chairman. One hopes Swannell\u2019s replacement, Archie Norman, who takes over on 1 September, is prepared for what is to come. Hail the new generation of electric black cabs London\u2019s black cabs have been voted in the past as the best-recognised design in London transport, proving more popular than the Routemaster bus and the Tube map. This week, the look of the next generation of black cabs \u2013 electric models \u2013 will be revealed by The London Taxi Company (LTC). This new generation of battery-powered cabs is due to be ushered in from later this year as Transport for London moves to reduce toxic pollution from diesel engines. On Tuesday, the wrapping will come off the new vehicles, which will be moving around the streets of the capital (and other cities at later times). TfL has pinpointed the existing black cabs as one of the major contributors to traffic pollution \u2013 15% of nitrogen oxides are reported to have come from cabs. LTC will unveil the new design, so far only seen camouflaged in public, at a breakfast event in Wapping led by chief exec Chris Gubbey. From 1 January, all new black cabs will have to be battery-powered electric models and \u00a318m is being spent to upgrade the capital\u2019s power grids, including the installation of 300 fast-charging stations. An initial 75 stations are due to be operational by the end of the year. Some sites will be exclusively for black cabs but others will be open to owners of other electric vehicles, such as Teslas and electric BMWs. Cab drivers with an existing taxi older than 10 years will be able to claim up to \u00a35,000 from TfL later this year towards the cost of a new zero-emission cab.",

      "bodyText": "Household spending has fallen at the fastest rate in almost four years as rising prices have made consumers less willing to splash out on furniture, clothing and trips out. Spending fell by 0.3% between April and June compared with the same period a year earlier, the biggest drop since the third quarter of 2013, according to Visa\u2019s consumer spending index. The report provides the latest evidence that cash-strapped consumers are more reluctant to spend money on non-essential items as prices in the shops rise at a faster pace than wages. Spending on household goods fell 3.4% in June compared with a year earlier, while recreation and culture spending dropped for the first time in four years, down 1.2%. Clothing and footwear spending was down 0.5%. \u201cJune data provides further evidence that an increase in the cost of living, coupled with slowing wage growth, are beginning to squeeze household disposable income,\u201d said Kevin Jenkins, UK and Ireland managing director at Visa. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that inflation is beginning to affect shopping habits, with consumers diverting their spending to essentials. Spend on food and drink grew by nearly 2%, while household goods suffered from a substantial drop as consumers cut back on big-ticket furniture and homewares.\u201d Official figures to be published on Wednesday are expected to show that wage growth including bonuses slowed to 1.8% year-on-year in the three months to May, from 2.1% in the three months to April. It would be the slowest rate of growth since the beginning of 2016, and would widen the gap between pay growth and inflation, which stands at 2.9%. Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec, said there was little sign of a pickup in wage growth in the coming months, intensifying the squeeze on household finances. She said that the weak outlook for pay was likely to discourage the Bank of England from raising interest rates for the time being. \u201cThe lack of upward momentum in pay growth, in several economies including the UK and US, has been a central talking point of late as policymakers debate the cause of this and what this implies for the stance of monetary policy,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the UK context, we suspect the lack of pay growth will help the MPC [monetary policy committee] delay any normalisation until Brexit uncertainties facing the UK economy have died down.\u201d The Visa report is the latest sign that consumers are growing more reluctant to commit to big spending decisions. New car sales in the UK fell for a third month in June, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, ending five years of solid growth. There are also signs that housing market demand is cooling, with Halifax reporting a 1% drop in average prices in June, to \u00a3218,390.",

      "bodyText": "A hung parliament. Inflation going up but growth slowing. A divided nation ill at ease with itself. Welcome back to the 1970s, like now a time when Britain was forced to take a long, painful look at itself. Make no mistake, this is a good thing. Whether you are in favour of hard Brexit, soft Brexit, clean Brexit or no Brexit, it should be clear that there is something fundamentally wrong with the economy. The same old problems keep surfacing: too small an industrial base; too much debt; too great a geographical divide between the rich south and the rest of the country; too many poorly paid low-productivity jobs. Ministers boast about the underlying strength of the economy but reach for the wrong 1970s David Bowie reference when they suggest everything is hunky dory. It\u2019s more a case of always crashing in the same car. In the 1970s, both left and right were agreed that the economy required fundamental changes. The Conservatives had Thatcherism, a blast of the free market designed to shake Britain out of what was seen as corporatist complacency; Labour had the Alternative Economic Strategy built around nationalisation, planning agreements between state and industry, and reflation behind tariff walls. Thatcherism won that battle and not since has there been the desire to do anything remotely as radical. In the 1980s, it was possible for Britain to convince itself that the financial sector could fill the hole left by the decline of manufacturing. But the big bang in the City was not the solution. In the 1990s, the economy had a purple patch when the big devaluation of sterling after departure from the exchange rate mechanism coincided with strong world growth following the collapse of communism. But globalisation too proved no panacea. By the 2000s, Britain\u2019s economic model involved attracting hot money into the City of London, which kept the pound nice and strong. An overvalued exchange rate meant that cheap imports from emerging markets such as China became even cheaper. Inflation was duly tamed, which meant that the Bank of England could keep interest rates low. The availability of easy-terms credit encouraged people to load up on debt in order to buy houses, which rose sharply in value, making people feel richer even though they weren\u2019t really. This approach crashed and burned in the crisis of 2007-08, which should have been the time for a rethink. Regrettably, the bad old habits proved hard to break. Halfway through the 2010 parliament, David Cameron and George Osborne had a problem. They had arrived in office promising a different economic model that would be less dependent on private and public debt, and the result was that taxes were raised and public spending was cut to rid Britain of its budgetary incontinence. Businesses would be encouraged to invest by the commitment to reduce the budget deficit, while the Bank of England\u2019s easy money regime would ensure that the economy kept growing at a reasonable pace. Things didn\u2019t work out as planned and the reason they didn\u2019t was that Cameron and Osborne failed to understand just how structurally weak the economy was. They assumed that it wouldn\u2019t really matter if consumer spending was flat and the housing market a bit depressed because growth would pick up elsewhere \u2013 in manufacturing, exports and investment \u2013 to compensate. But there was no rebalancing. Without the consumer and the housing market, it was not a case of different growth, it was a case of no growth. Fearful of losing the 2015 election, steps were taken to get the housing market moving. Five years on, Theresa May and Philip Hammond have the same problem. Consumers are being squeezed by higher inflation and have already run down their savings. Activity in the housing market has stalled because the mini-boom set off by Cameron and Osborne has run its course. Across large parts of the country, property has become unaffordable. But, as in 2012, there is scant evidence of the other bits of the economy picking up the baton. Surveys of manufacturing have been strong in recent months but the hard official data has been weak. Exports were up in the latest quarter but not by nearly as much as the government might have hoped given the fall in the value of sterling. As ever, UK manufacturers are finding it hard to resist the temptation to take advantage of a cheaper pound to raise prices rather than to secure bigger market share. So that\u2019s the position. Rightly, the Bank of England is getting a bit concerned about the levels of personal debt that it has helped to generate by almost a decade of ultra-low interest rates and copious amount of quantitative easing. Geographically sundered, Britain is in the curious position of simultaneously having the problems both of a developed country and a developing country: overheating in London and the south-east, the need to nurture growth in the rest of the country. These deep-seated issues require structural change, which is why industrial policy is back in vogue. The government\u2019s green paper on the subject was published in January and set out 10 areas for attention, including upgrading infrastructure, encouraging inward investment and skills, and cultivating world-leading sectors. But as a new report to be published on Monday points out, the vast majority of the actions detailed in the green paper were things the government was already doing or were modest initiatives already in the pipeline. The one notable exception, according to a paper by Steve Fothergill, Tony Gore and Peter Wells of the Centre for Regional Economic and Social Research at Sheffield Hallam University, has been investing in science, research and technology. Here, there has been some new money: Hammond announced almost \u00a35bn of funding for R&amp;D for the period up until 2020-21. But as the report details, the R&amp;D spending is being targeted at a narrow range of sectors \u2013 healthcare and medicine, robotics and artificial intelligence, batteries, self-driving vehicles, materials for the future, and satellites and space technology. This approach \u2013 picking winners by any other name \u2013 has the attraction of being at the cutting edge of change. The downside, Forthergill, Gore and Wells note, is that these sectors account for employment in only a tiny fragment (around 1% of the economy) and 10% of jobs in manufacturing. What\u2019s more, the money will be heavily channelled to those parts of the country that are rich in R&amp;D centres: an arc to the immediate north, west and south of London. The report concludes, rightly, that the government\u2019s focus is too narrow to provide a basis for the revival of British industry. It will be great for Cambridge, which has twice as many scientific research and development jobs as the whole of the Midlands, and more than Scotland and Wales combined. For the bits of the country that really require help, it will be a god-awful small affair.",

      "bodyText": "When Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts, was appointed last year by Theresa May to lead a review of modern employment practices, he said it would be \u201creally important to get out and listen to people\u201d, as opposed to merely crunching data and numbers. Let us hope he has listened to some of the same people as Frank Field, the former chair of the work and pensions committee. Field\u2019s latest report from the frontline of the gig economy told some depressing, if by now familiar, stories. Workers can be forced into forms of self-employment against their will. Contracts can offer effective wages of less than \u00a32.50 an hour and be enforced with threats of fines or loss of work. Field\u2019s latest report drew on accounts from workers at Parcelforce, DPD and British Car Auctions but it echoed the findings of his earlier work, including the original review that prompted May to appoint Taylor. In the coming days the Taylor report will be published and it will present the first test of the Conservatives\u2019 manifesto promise to \u201cmake sure that people working in the \u2018gig\u2019 economy are properly protected\u201d. What should it say? The first task is to end the absurdity of bogus self-employment. This employment category is plainly being abused by some companies whose workers continue to be told how to behave like regular employees for all practical purposes \u2013 their work can be directed down to exact details, including time, hours, place and uniform. The only real difference is that the employer is able to avoid paying employers\u2019 national insurance and pension contributions, and offering protections such as maternity and sick pay. It\u2019s a scam. Massive benefits accrue to the employers and very few to the workers. The best solution is backed by the TUC and Field: reverse the burden of legal proof so that companies must demonstrate that someone is not an employee. To expect workers to go to an employment tribunal, or even a court, to establish normal employment rights is unfair and impractical. Taylor could propose a fast, simple and transparent system for assessing self-employed status. The current system is either a muddle, or an invitation to unscrupulous companies to see what they can get away with. A second area is more contentious. It seems unlikely that Taylor will propose abolishing zero-hour contracts because, in some cases, their flexibility benefits both sides. That will not be universally popular, but it would be a realistic position. But Taylor could \u2013 and should \u2013 establish the principle that companies should pay a premium for flexibility. In regular work that is paid by the hour, companies expect to pay overtime. The same approach would also operate with zero-hour and short-hours contracts: contracted hours would be paid at a standard rate and anything on top would attract a higher hourly rate. As the TUC has argued, such a system would also \u201ccreate a financial incentive for employers to reduce their reliance on insecure forms of work\u201d. Third, Taylor must ensure that proposals to promote the \u201cworkers\u2019 voice\u201d within companies mean something substantial. The prime minister has an appalling record of obfuscation in this area. She promised to put workers in boardrooms but then watered down the idea to say an existing non-executive director could represent them. If Taylor wants to establish German-style \u201cworkplace citizenship\u201d in the UK, he must set out the practical steps. In the gig economy, a blast of old-fashioned collective bargaining could do more to improve the lot of workers than technical tweaks to current employment laws. Andrew Haldane, chief economist at the Bank or England, was right when he argued last month that a period of \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d has left workers in the UK less able to bargain for higher wages. Taylor must avoid May\u2019s wishy-washy approach and acknowledge that the best people to represent workers\u2019 interests are workers themselves. Power on with Hinkley: but then it\u2019s time to rethink energy strategy It was always a case of when, not if, Hinkley Point C went over budget and over schedule. But EDF\u2019s admission last week that its new nuclear power station in Somerset risks costing as much as \u00a32.2bn more than its original \u00a318bn price tag, and coming online 15 months late, is still staggering. The French state-owned firm has been planning the project for years, so such a significant hike at such an early stage does not bode well for future delays and cost increases. Nonetheless, Hinkley Point C should go ahead. A huge amount of work has already been done, and the project brings billions in investment and thousands of jobs to a corner of the country that needs it. It will also provide 7% of the UK\u2019s electricity and help Britain hit otherwise impossible carbon targets. But the case for a new fleet of nuclear power stations beyond Hinkley \u2013 already highly debatable before this week \u2013 looks increasingly weak. None looks able to tackle with sufficient urgency the UK\u2019s challenges of energy security and cutting emissions in the 2020s. The project that seemed closest after Hinkley, Moorside in Cumbria, is now among the walking dead after its reactor vendor went bust and one of two key investors sold its stake. Plans for new reactors at Wylfa in Wales, backed by Japan\u2019s Hitachi, are the next closest along the road, but the Horizon project still needs to raise huge sums of capital. The Japanese and UK government are considering taking a public stake, although the move would put taxpayers on the hook if it suffers budget overruns, like Hinkley. China wants to build a new nuclear power station at Essex but would face at least four years of clearing regulatory hurdles before it could even begin. Less than a fortnight into his new job, energy minister Richard Harrington said the UK still needed new nuclear. But it\u2019s not too late for officials to say no, minister. The future of British power is in wind, solar and gas, energy efficiency, smart grids and the sort of enormous battery plant Elon Musk has revealed Tesla will construct in Australia. Hinkley should be the last nuclear power station the UK ever builds. Ashley\u2019s booze claims fail to dilute Sports Direct\u2019s value Is this the sort of boast you want to hear from your chief executive? \u201cI like to get drunk, I\u2019m a power drinker. My thing is not to drink regularly, it\u2019s to binge drink.\u201d The speaker, of course, was Sports Direct\u2019s Mike Ashley, in the high court last week where he was defending claims that he agreed to pay a banker \u00a315m during a drinking session in a London pub. The case continues, but here\u2019s the remarkable fact: while Ashley was describing his boozing habits, Sports Direct\u2019s share price barely moved. There was no loss of confidence in the company \u2013 or, at least, no fresh slump after last year\u2019s revelations about working practices at its Shirebrook warehouse. Actually, it\u2019s not so remarkable. Share prices move when facts emerge that differ from expectations. Ashley\u2019s boozing is no secret. Investors know what they\u2019re getting: a boss who owns more than half the shares and doesn\u2019t care what they think.",

In the gig economy, a blast of old-fashioned collective bargaining could do more to improve the lot of workers than technical tweaks to current employment laws. Andrew Haldane, chief economist at the Bank or England, was right when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/21/slow-wage-growth-down-to-return-to-the-past-bank-of-england-chief-economist\" title=\"\">argued last month</a> that a period of \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d has left workers in the UK less able to bargain for higher wages. Taylor must avoid May\u2019s wishy-washy approach and acknowledge that the best people to represent workers\u2019 interests are workers themselves.</p> <h2>Power on with Hinkley: but then it\u2019s time to rethink energy strategy</h2> <p>It was always a case of when, not if, Hinkley Point C went over budget and over schedule. But EDF\u2019s admission last week that its new nuclear power station in Somerset risks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/03/hinkley-point-c-is-22bn-over-budget-and-a-year-behind-schedule-edf-admits\" title=\"\">costing as much as \u00a32.2bn more than its original \u00a318bn price tag,</a> and coming online 15 months late, is still staggering.</p> <p>The French state-owned firm has been planning the project for years, so such a significant hike at such an early stage does not bode well for future delays and cost increases. Nonetheless, Hinkley Point C should go ahead. A huge amount of work has already been done, and the project brings billions in investment and thousands of jobs to a corner of the country that needs it. It will also provide 7% of the UK\u2019s electricity and help Britain hit otherwise impossible carbon targets.</p> <p>But the case for a new fleet of nuclear power stations beyond Hinkley \u2013 already highly debatable before this week \u2013 looks increasingly weak. None looks able to tackle with sufficient urgency the UK\u2019s challenges of energy security and cutting emissions in the 2020s.</p> <p>The project that seemed closest after Hinkley, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/03/toshiba-exit-could-scrap-plans-for-new-nuclear-power-plant-in-cumbria\" title=\"\">Moorside in Cumbria</a>, is now among the walking dead after its reactor vendor went bust and one of two key investors sold its stake.</p> <p>Plans for new reactors at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/20/hitachi-hnuclear-plant-wales-hinkley-point-edf-bechtel\" title=\"\">Wylfa in Wales, backed by Japan\u2019s Hitachi</a>, are the next closest along the road, but the Horizon project still needs to raise huge sums of capital. The Japanese and UK government are considering taking a public stake, although the move would put taxpayers on the hook if it suffers budget overruns, like Hinkley.</p> <p>China wants to build a new nuclear power station at Essex but would face at least four years of clearing regulatory hurdles before it could even begin.</p> <p>Less than a fortnight into his new job, energy minister Richard Harrington said the UK still needed new nuclear. But it\u2019s not too late for officials to say no, minister.</p> <p>The future of British power is in wind, solar and gas, energy efficiency, smart grids and the sort of enormous battery plant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jul/07/tesla-to-build-worlds-biggest-lithium-ion-battery-in-south-australia\" title=\"\">Elon Musk has revealed Tesla will construct in Australia</a>. Hinkley should be the last nuclear power station the UK ever builds.</p> <h2>Ashley\u2019s booze claims fail to dilute Sports Direct\u2019s value</h2> <p>Is this the sort of boast you want to hear from your chief executive? \u201cI like to get drunk, I\u2019m a power drinker. My thing is not to drink regularly, it\u2019s to binge drink.\u201d</p> <p>The speaker, of course, was Sports Direct\u2019s Mike Ashley, in the high court last week where he was defending claims that he agreed to pay a banker \u00a315m during a drinking session in a London pub.</p> <p>The case continues, but here\u2019s the remarkable fact: while Ashley was describing his boozing habits, Sports Direct\u2019s share price barely moved. There was no loss of confidence in the company \u2013 or, at least, no fresh slump after last year\u2019s revelations about working practices at its Shirebrook warehouse.</p> <p>Actually, it\u2019s not so remarkable. Share prices move when facts emerge that differ from expectations. Ashley\u2019s boozing is no secret. Investors know what they\u2019re getting: a boss who owns more than half the shares and doesn\u2019t care what they think.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "June shone a little brighter for Donald Trump\u2019s plans to make America great again. After several months of disappointing jobs growth, US hiring picked up steam again. But beneath the surface there\u2019s a problem for the president: the US economy appears to be running out of gas. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the US had added 222,000 new jobs in June, comfortably beating expectations. But, once again, most of those jobs were in low-paying industries, and wages are barely keeping pace with inflation. Manufacturing languished while food services and healthcare led the pack. The numbers were the latest in a strange series of figures coming out about the US that point to an economy that seems almost becalmed, with every positive economic point countered by its opposing force: a strong job market and rising consumer confidence, but lower automotive and retail sales and low overall consumer spending. The most worrying number for Trump is arguably GDP. The growth in gross domestic product \u2013 the broadest measure of US economic health \u2013 is sluggish, to say the least. And Trump, whose budget assumes he will double the rate of growth, has gone all out, promising that his business acumen will soon change that. \u201cI really believe it,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Fox News in April. \u201cWe\u2019re saying 3% but I say 4 over the next few years. And I say there\u2019s no reason we shouldn\u2019t be able to get at some point into the future to 5 and above.\u201d So far, the numbers aren\u2019t supporting him. The US economy grew 1.6% in 2016, its worst performance since 2011, and this year is hardly off to a roaring start. The commerce department released its third \u2013 and final \u2013 estimate of GDP growth for the first quarter last month, and it came in at a measly 1.4%. This in an economy where, as the president has been keen to highlight, stock markets are at record highs, there is close to full employment, the oil price remains low and inflation is under control. Arguably the US is still in Obama\u2019s economy \u2013 but that argument won\u2019t hold forever. And while Trump will no doubt continue to blame his predecessor for this era of slow growth, economists are not convinced he can do much to change it. Gus Faucher, the chief economist at PNC Bank, said the likelihood of returning to the years of 3-4% growth any time soon looks increasingly unlikely. US GDP has not exceeded 3% per annum for a record-breaking 11 years. \u201cEconomic growth under President Trump looks a lot like economic growth under President Obama,\u201d said Faucher. With the unemployment rate at a 16-year low after 81 consecutive months of growth, goosing a little extra gas out of the economy would mean adding more workers. Labor markets have tightened, and Faucher said the data, and his anecdotal experience, suggests employers are struggling to find skilled workers. \u201cThere\u2019s a real shortage of people with the right skills out there,\u201d said Faucher. Immigration would be one way around that problem. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t seem very likely,\u201d he said. Another potential boost for business \u2013 Trump\u2019s planned tax reform \u2013 is stalled in Congress, and his plans for massive infrastructure spending are also likely to face political headwinds, and in any case could be a mixed blessing. While huge investment in much needed improvements to America\u2019s road, rail and airport network would boost productivity in the long run, in a tight labor market it would pitch business against federally funded projects for skilled workers. \u201cThe time to do these kinds of projects is in an era of higher unemployment,\u201d said Faucher. A recently published report by the Shift commission on the future of work also undermined many of Trump\u2019s claims over employment and a promised 4% GDP growth. America is getting old and will not have the workforce to support major growth. By 2024, nearly 25% of the workforce is projected to be 55 or older (more than twice the share in 1994). Many of those workers, the Shift commission found, may be staying in the workforce not because they want to, but because they have to. Nearly 30% of respondents 55 and over claimed to have zero retirement savings, and 26% had $50,000 or less. Numbers are tricky, and the world of work has changed, making it hard for many to see the good news in the jobs report and other economic statistics, said Roy Bahat, head of Bloomberg Beta and co-chair of the Shift Commission. \u201cWe have a disconnect between the economic statistics and the facts and feelings about what people are going through,\u201d he said. For those \u2013 like Trump \u2013 pinning their hopes on a return to higher growth, there may be even worse news. According to Princeton economist Robert Gordon, there is evidence that the US has taken growth for granted and that a unique, 250-year-old period of growth is over. In his book The Rise and Fall of American Growth, Gordon argues the kind of rapid economic growth currently considered normal, and expected to continue forever, was in fact a one-time-only event. Gordon argues the impact of technology can not compare with the impact of the first industrial revolution, which brought steam engines and railroads, and the second, which brought us electricity, the internal combustion engine, running water and indoor toilets, to name a few of its society-shaking changes. The first two industrial revolutions took about 100 years to filter through society. By contrast, the benefits of the technological/digital age ran out of steam in decades, and have failed to support the sort of growth rates we had come to expect as \u201cnormal\u201d. But, argues Gordon, perhaps higher growth rates never were normal. There was \u201cvirtually no economic growth before 1750, suggesting that the rapid progress made over the past 250 years could well be a unique episode in human history rather than a guarantee of endless future advance at the same rate.\u201d \u201cYes, we are \u2018gigantically\u2019 ahead of where our counterparts were in 1870, but our progress has slowed, and we face stronger barriers to continued growth than were faced by our ancestors a century or two ago,\u201d he writes.",

    "webTitle": "In other circumstances, we\u2019d raise rates. But with Brexit looming, how can we?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Arguments for the Bank of England to raise interest rates are many and growing. It\u2019s why an increasing number of Threadneedle Street policymakers have voted for a rise and even the governor Mark Carney has felt the need to hint that an increase is not too far away. Top of the list is the business cycle. This esoteric term is often used in economic circles to describe the natural lifespan of an economic boom, or at least consistent expansion. The concern is that this period is just what its proponents say it is \u2013 natural \u2013 and is nearing its end. Any attempt to delay this process is just storing up trouble for the future. The most immediate analogy is the 2008 financial crash. It can be argued that the natural business cycle was coming to an end in 2003. The economy was slowing as many important industries paused for breath after a good eight years of expansion. Gordon Brown, being a good Keynesian, had promised to end boom and bust. To this end, he opened the public spending taps and gave the economy a modest boost. In response, UK plc sailed on. Without going into too much of the history, he missed the fact that more of the boost to borrowing was coming from the banks \u2013 as were his tax receipts \u2013 so when the economy was hit sideways by the US sub-prime disaster, the UK suffered more than most \u2013 and more than it would have done if some of the excesses had been weeded out by a milder slowdown five years earlier. The Bank of England is worried that the UK stands in the foothills of the same debt mountain. Public spending is under pressure to ameliorate the worst of an economic slowdown while the banks, still wedded to a bonus culture that spurs reckless lending, are shovelling money out of the door in any way they can. At the moment that means unfeasibly low-cost car loans. Who knows what they\u2019ll be up to tomorrow? To those who worry about unstable financial markets, what this situation needs is calming down. Regulators are trying to keep a check on the finance industry\u2019s worst excesses with tighter lending rules. Last week the Bank of England demanded that lenders re-examine the worst-case scenarios they use when lending to businesses and individuals, amid fears that banks are basing their decisions on a benign economic environment lasting forever. Regulators have their uses, say the supporters of higher interest rates, but there is nothing the banks understand better than a hike in the cost of borrowing: they must pass it on and it must prevent the flakiest customers from accessing credit. More than that, there would be a cleansing of the stock of debt. This means that many of the firms and individuals who have borrowed large sums and are so broke they struggle to pay the interest on their loans would be exposed. Next on the list is the exodus of migrant workers as they return to their home nations across the Channel. This movement of people is expected to raise pay rates for the domestic population and feed through into higher prices. With inflation already at 2.9%, the thinking goes that the effect of the weaker pound on import costs, although waning in the second half of the year, will be superseded by higher wages as a spur for inflation. To calm down wage-induced inflation, what could be better than higher interest rates? If a central bank policymaker subscribes to these arguments, they might see themselves voting in August to reverse the emergency interest rate cut made last year \u2013 the one made in response to the panicky aftermath of the Brexit vote. Two more rises could follow in 2018, should the expected inflationary pressures stay in place. Michael Saunders, one of the three policymakers to vote for a rise at the monetary policy committee\u2019s meeting last month, qualified his call for a rise when he told the Guardian: \u201cIf rates do go up, it will be in the context of the economy doing OK and unemployment being low and probably falling.\u201d And there lies the problem. The economy is already weakening and the main measure of economic activity, GDP, is likely to slump in the second half of the year. Saunders says the Brexit negotiations are no constraint on MPC decision-making. But the uncertainty created by the Brexit talks is a key reason his colleagues will reject a rise. This is the kind of denial of realpolitik that we have come to expect from some Bank of England officials: everyone can see it is just too risky to increase the cost of credit when David Davis is in the middle of a tense arm-wrestle with Michel Barnier. The atmosphere is already heavy with doubt and uncertainty. Inevitably, a rate rise in this context would be seen as irresponsible. Next year, the economic situation will be the same or worse. And in the years after Brexit, wages growth will remain stuck in first gear, while big businesses scan the EU for cheap locations to build their next factory. So when will interest rates rise? Not for a very long time.",

      "body": "<p>Arguments for the Bank of England to raise interest rates are many and growing. It\u2019s why an increasing number of Threadneedle Street policymakers have voted for a rise and even the governor Mark Carney has felt the need to hint that an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jun/28/bank-of-england-interest-rates-house-prices-pound-euro-ftse-business-live\" title=\"\">increase is not too far away</a>.</p> <p>Top of the list is the business cycle. This esoteric term is often used in economic circles to describe the natural lifespan of an economic boom, or at least consistent expansion.</p> <p>The concern is that this period is just what its proponents say it is \u2013 natural \u2013 and is nearing its end. Any attempt to delay this process is just storing up trouble for the future.</p> <p>The most immediate analogy is the 2008 financial crash. It can be argued that the natural business cycle was coming to an end in 2003. The economy was slowing as many important industries paused for breath after a good eight years of expansion. Gordon Brown, being a good Keynesian, had promised to end boom and bust. To this end, he opened the public spending taps and gave the economy a modest boost. In response, UK plc sailed on.</p> <p>Without going into too much of the history, he missed the fact that more of the boost to borrowing was coming from the banks \u2013 as were his tax receipts \u2013 so when the economy was hit sideways by the US sub-prime disaster, the UK suffered more than most \u2013 and more than it would have done if some of the excesses had been weeded out by a milder slowdown five years earlier.</p> <p>The Bank of England is worried that the UK stands in the foothills of the same debt mountain. Public spending is under pressure to ameliorate the worst of an economic slowdown while the banks, still wedded to a bonus culture that spurs reckless lending, are shovelling money out of the door in any way they can. At the moment that means unfeasibly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/10/car-loans-personal-contract-plans-vehicle-financial-crisis-pcp\" title=\"\">low-cost car loans</a>. Who knows what they\u2019ll be up to tomorrow? To those who worry about unstable financial markets, what this situation needs is calming down.</p> <p>Regulators are trying to keep a check on the finance industry\u2019s worst excesses with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/04/bank-of-england-steps-up-scrutiny-of-lenders\" title=\"\">tighter lending rules</a>. Last week the Bank of England demanded that lenders re-examine the worst-case scenarios they use when lending to businesses and individuals, amid fears that banks are basing their decisions on a benign economic environment lasting forever.</p> <p>Regulators have their uses, say the supporters of higher interest rates, but there is nothing the banks understand better than a hike in the cost of borrowing: they must pass it on and it must prevent the flakiest customers from accessing credit. More than that, there would be a cleansing of the stock of debt. This means that many of the firms and individuals who have borrowed large sums and are so broke they struggle to pay the interest on their loans would be exposed.</p> <p>Next on the list is the exodus of migrant workers as they return to their home nations across the Channel. This movement of people is expected to raise pay rates for the domestic population and feed through into higher prices. With inflation already at 2.9%, the thinking goes that the effect of the weaker pound on import costs, although waning in the second half of the year, will be superseded by higher wages as a spur for inflation. To calm down wage-induced inflation, what could be better than higher interest rates?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The economy is already weakening and the main measure of economic activity, GDP, is likely to slump</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If a central bank policymaker subscribes to these arguments, they might see themselves voting in August to reverse the emergency interest rate cut made last year \u2013 the one made in response to the panicky aftermath of the Brexit vote. Two more rises could follow in 2018, should the expected inflationary pressures stay in place.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/04/bank-of-england-michael-saunders-interest-rates-mpc-brexit\" title=\"\">Michael Saunders</a>, one of the three policymakers to vote for a rise at the monetary policy committee\u2019s meeting last month, qualified his call for a rise when he told the <em>Guardian</em>: \u201cIf rates do go up, it will be in the context of the economy doing OK and unemployment being low and probably falling.\u201d</p> <p>And there lies the problem. The economy is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/09/clouds-gather-over-uk-economy-as-more-data-points-to-lacklustre-growth\" title=\"\">already weakening</a> and the main measure of economic activity, GDP, is likely to slump in the second half of the year.</p> <p>Saunders says the Brexit negotiations are no constraint on MPC decision-making. But the uncertainty created by the Brexit talks is a key reason his colleagues will reject a rise. This is the kind of denial of realpolitik that we have come to expect from some Bank of England officials: everyone can see it is just too risky to increase the cost of credit when David Davis is in the middle of a tense arm-wrestle with Michel Barnier.</p> <p>The atmosphere is already heavy with doubt and uncertainty. Inevitably, a rate rise in this context would be seen as irresponsible.</p> <p>Next year, the economic situation will be the same or worse. And in the years after Brexit, wages growth will remain stuck in first gear, while big businesses scan the EU for cheap locations to build their next factory. So when will interest rates rise? Not for a very long time.</p>",
