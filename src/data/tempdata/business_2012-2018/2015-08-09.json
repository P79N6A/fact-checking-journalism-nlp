      "bodyText": "The government must focus on unloved sectors such as hospitality and retail, if it is to tackle Britain\u2019s lamentable productivity record, according to a new analysis by thinktank the Institute for Public Policy Research. Tony Dolphin, the IPPR\u2019s chief economist, said that while the government tends to target support at the highly skilled workers in advanced manufacturing, it is the low-paid staff behind bars and checkouts whose performance may be critical to sustaining Britain\u2019s recovery. While manufacturers often have a strong incentive to improve their performance, because they must compete with more efficient foreign firms, \u201cthe same pressure does not exist across large parts of the domestic service sector economy, in areas such as hospitality, accommodation, parts of retailing and the care industry, which employ millions more people than what is left of our manufacturing industry,\u201d he said. The IPPR called on the government to \u201cthink more carefully about how its spending can help to boost productivity in these sectors of the economy\u201d. In the years 1979 to 2007, Britain\u2019s productivity expanded at an average annual rate of 2.3% in terms of worker output per hour, helping to drive rising living standards. Since then, it has fallen, by an average of 0.1% a year. The unexpected failure of output-per-hour to rebound after the financial crisis has been dubbed the \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d. That has opened up a gap with rival economies, threatening the sustainability of the economic upturn, which has so far been driven largely by a rapid increase in the number of people in jobs. The average German worker now produces 23% more output per hour than their British counterpart; a US worker as much as a third more, according to data from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Dolphin has analysed rival explanations of this \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d in detail, in a new study. He found that collapsing productivity in the North Sea oil sector \u2013 as remaining reserves become harder to extract \u2013 and in the financial sector \u2013 as the legacy of the crash plays out \u2013 must take part of the blame. Several other sectors, including retail and transport, also saw productivity fall sharply when the crisis hit. Since the recovery got underway in 2011, though, Dolphin said that another important explanation has been the rapid growth of employment in relatively low-productivity sectors. \u201cWhile jobs growth may have been strong during these three years of decent economic growth, it was disproportionately in low value-added \u2013 and low-paid \u2013 sectors of the economy,\u201d Dolphin said. It is hard to unravel the direction of causation, whether low-paid workers tend to be less productive, as firms take on cheap staff instead of investing in new hi-tech equipment; or low productivity prevents employers from giving their staff a pay rise. But Dolphin said the chancellor\u2019s bold decision to raise the minimum wage to \u00a39 by 2020 could help, by giving firms an incentive to invest in technology and training to get more out of their lower-paid staff, who will gradually become more costly to employ. \u201cProvided that it does not lead to rising prices, this welcome move will put pressure on firms to boost productivity in order to maintain their profit margins,\u201d the report said.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is preparing to hand out shares worth an estimated \u00a32.5m to its 10-strong management team. The payouts come a week after the government took the first steps since the 2008 taxpayer bailout to begin reducing its stake, which has fallen from 79% to just below 73% as a result. Ross McEwan, the chief executive, is poised to receive the last tranche of the 1m shares he was awarded in August 2012 when he was hired from Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The rest of his executive team are to be handed shares worth more than \u00a32m to sidestep the European Union\u2019s bonus cap which prevents banks handing out bonuses bigger than an employee\u2019s salary, or more than double it, if shareholders approve. McEwan, who replaced Stephen Hester as chief executive in September 2013, has waived to the share allowances, which would have been \u00a31m in his case. In February, RBS issued a statement about McEwan\u2019s intentions towards the share allowances which said: \u201cRoss McEwan has told the RBS board he does not intend to take the proceeds from his 2015 role-based allowance. Ross does not want this issue to be a distraction from the task of building a great bank for customers and shareholders.\u201d He is, however, due to be handed 95,318 shares, the last portion of the package he was offered in 2012 when he was lured from Australia to London to run the retail arm of the bank. According to the bank\u2019s latest annual report, these shares were included in his total pay for 2014 which showed he received \u00a31.8m in total. The shares are worth around \u00a3330,000 and were due to vest on 8 August. This would suggest that a stock exchange announcement confirming they have been released to him is likely in the coming days. Stock exchange disclosures from a year ago, also suggest that the bank is due to announce the share allowances that are being used to sidestep the EU bonus cap. These are part-payments of the annual allowances being handed to bankers to try to prevent their pay from falling as a result of the bonus cap. These share awards are being used by a large number of banks following the restriction on bonuses. In 2014, for instance, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and RBS handed out a total of \u00a330m in such allowances to their top management teams. The payments are being made amid a row over the sale of just over 5% of the taxpayers\u2019 stake at a \u00a31bn loss. Hedge funds bought 60% of the shares sold at 330p on Monday evening last week, just days after the bank had reported a half-year loss and warned it faced a swath of penalties over the way it sold mortgage bonds in the US before the crisis. The 330p is below the 502p average price that taxpayers paid for the stake, which was valued at \u00a345bn at the time of the bailouts. The shares closed on Friday at 345.5p. The government said it will not sell any more shares for 90 days, which suggests the next disposal could take place in December.",

    "webTitle": "Jeremy Corbyn is right to blame the banks, not Labour, for the financial crisis", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a question for you. Consider the following statement: \u201cWe must live within our means, so cutting the deficit is the top priority.\u201d Do you agree? If you said yes, you are with the majority. If you said no and are a member of the Labour party, you are almost certainly planning to vote for Jeremy Corbyn to be its next leader. The question was put as part of Labour\u2019s inquest into why it lost in May and, according to Ed Miliband\u2019s policy coordinator, Jon Cruddas, is evidence that the party\u2019s austerity-lite message was not tough enough. He said in a blog post: \u201cWe can seek to change the views of the public, but it\u2019s best not to ignore them.\u201d Fair enough, you might think. Labour lost because it wasn\u2019t credible on the economy and the reason it wasn\u2019t credible was because the electorate thought Miliband would borrow and spend too much. If this was a game of Cluedo, the solution would not be Colonel Mustard with the lead piping, but George Osborne with the budget deficit. The conclusion, therefore, is simple. To avoid defeat in 2020, Labour needs to get back in tune with the electorate by showing that it too would balance the budget even if doing so means welfare cuts. The message from the party\u2019s grandees is that the flirtation with Corbyn is all very well but it is now time to stop being silly. However, it appears the message is falling on deaf ears. Why is that? Why are Labour supporters determined to resist the message from the 58% that say \u201cwe must live within our means, so cutting the deficit is the top priority\u201d? In part, it is because most Labour members have spent the past five years believing that there was no overspending or reckless borrowing in advance of the deep recession of 2008-09. Instead, they have always said the reason for the crisis was that the banks were too laxly regulated and in consequence were given licence to blow up the economy. They suspect that Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall by and large agree, but have decided the line to take is that while Labour did not do anything wrong, political reality means they need to apologise anyway. Corbyn is the only candidate sticking to the line that the banks were to blame and he is reaping the benefit. Not least because he is absolutely right. Support for this argument has helpfully been provided by a recent House of Commons briefing paper from Matthew Keep. This looks at three separate measures of the public finances: the size of the budget deficit, the size of national debt as a proportion of the economy\u2019s output (gross domestic product) and the percentage of GDP swallowed up by interest payments on the national debt. None provides any support for the idea that Labour profligacy caused the crisis. Let\u2019s start with the budget deficit. In the 10 years between Tony Blair\u2019s election victory in 1997 to 2007, the year the subprime mortgage crisis broke, the average budget deficit was 1.4% \u2013 half the average under Margaret Thatcher and John Major. In 2006-07, the deficit was 2.6%. As for national debt, this stood at 39.9% of GDP when Gordon Brown became chancellor and was 36% when he succeeded Blair as prime minister. Debt interest payments amounted to 2% of GDP, which was slightly up on the trough of 1.8% reached in 2002-03 and 2003-04, but lower than the Conservatives ever managed between 1979 and 1997. The House of Commons analysis does not look at the interest rates the Labour government had to pay to finance its borrowing during the recession, but bond yields provide a clue as to whether the financial markets took fright at the rapid increase in the size of the deficit. There is no evidence that they did. Yields on 10-year bonds rose in the runup to the 2010 election, but only marginally, from about 3.75% to 4%. They would have shot up a lot higher had the markets seriously thought the increase in the budget deficit to 11% of GDP was the result of Labour going on a spending spree. There is, therefore, scant evidence that it was Labour\u2019s fiscal irresponsibility that caused the crisis. As Corbyn has rightly noted, people did not queue outside Northern Rock branches for three days in September 2007 because Labour was spending too much on teachers and nurses. It has been a catastrophic political blunder not to challenge the myth that Brown\u2019s government caused the crisis and the austerity that followed. The choice, correctly framed by the economist Simon Wren-Lewis, is whether to pretend Osborne\u2019s version of events is true and own up to perceived past mistakes or to contest it. Pleading guilty seems the easier line to take, but it isn\u2019t. The confession would be brandished by the government for the next five years as proof that Labour should never again be trusted with the public finances. Instead, Labour needs to start its fightback by rehabilitating the record of the Blair-Brown years, making the point that the purpose of the pre-crisis borrowing was to modernise and improve the NHS and shabby schools. It also needs to challenge the idea that all borrowing at all times is bad. If that were the case, individuals would have to save up the entire asking price for a house rather than buying it on a mortgage and there would be no startup capital to launch businesses. Accordingly, the idea that \u201cwe should live within our means\u201d is consistent with the government running deficits, provided that the borrowing is affordable and the benefits exceed the cost. It is hardly surprising that most voters agreed with the question posed in Labour\u2019s inquest, but that is because it was put in such a way as to get that answer. The result would be different if the question was: \u201cDo you believe that the government should borrow at historically low interest rates to invest in the railways or the NHS if that means it takes longer to balance the books?\u201d There are plenty of legitimate reasons for Corbyn\u2019s rivals to attack him, for which there is not room in this column, but his approach to austerity is not one of them. Instead, he has come up with a version of the old political maxim \u2013 never apologise, never explain \u2013 that makes macroeconomic sense and is resonating with Labour supporters. He has explained what he would do \u2013 borrow to invest and have no set timetable for deficit reduction \u2013 while apologising for the right thing: Labour\u2019s over-lax financial regulation. It is proving a better strategy than apologising for the wrong thing and not explaining.",

Labour lost because it wasn\u2019t credible on the economy and the reason it wasn\u2019t credible was because the electorate thought Miliband would borrow and spend too much. If this was a game of Cluedo, the solution would not be Colonel Mustard with the lead piping, but George Osborne with the budget deficit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/08/jeremy-corbyn-could-bring-back-labours-clause-iv-on-public-ownership\">Jeremy Corbyn suggests he would bring back Labour's nationalising clause IV</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The conclusion, therefore, is simple. To avoid defeat in 2020, Labour needs to get back in tune with the electorate by showing that it too would balance the budget even if doing so means welfare cuts. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/04/labour-must-end-the-madness-over-jeremy-corbyn-says-alan-johnson\">message from the party\u2019s grandees</a> is that the flirtation with Corbyn is all very well but it is now time to stop being silly. However, it appears the message is falling on deaf ears.</p> <p>Why is that? Why are Labour supporters determined to resist the message from the 58% that say \u201cwe must live within our means, so cutting the deficit is the top priority\u201d?</p> <p>In part, it is because most Labour members have spent the past five years believing that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/03/senior-tory-financial-crash-was-purely-a-banking-crisis-not-labour-overspend\">there was no overspending or reckless borrowing</a> in advance of the deep recession of 2008-09. Instead, they have always said the reason for the crisis was that the banks were too laxly regulated and in consequence were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/04/labour-spent-too-much-banks\">given licence to blow up the economy</a>. They suspect that Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall by and large agree, but have decided the line to take is that while Labour did not do anything wrong, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/13/andy-burnham-apologises-labour-overspending\">political reality means they need to apologise anyway</a>.<br></p> <p>Corbyn is the only candidate sticking to the line that the banks were to blame and he is reaping the benefit. Not least because he is absolutely right. <br></p> <p>Support for this argument has helpfully been provided by a recent <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05745\">House of Commons briefing paper from Matthew Keep</a>. This looks at three separate measures of the public finances: the size of the budget deficit, the size of national debt as a proportion of the economy\u2019s output (gross domestic product) and the percentage of GDP swallowed up by interest payments on the national debt. <br></p> <p>None provides any support for the idea that Labour profligacy caused the crisis. Let\u2019s start with the budget deficit. In the 10 years between Tony Blair\u2019s election victory in 1997 to 2007, the year the subprime mortgage crisis broke, the average budget deficit was 1.4% \u2013 half the average under Margaret Thatcher and John Major. In 2006-07, the deficit was 2.6%.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"474d8f5b8d12880b4297144e2d03be60e43a3f8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/474d8f5b8d12880b4297144e2d03be60e43a3f8d/0_0_460_230/460.jpg\" alt=\"Debt interest payments\" width=\"460\" height=\"230\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As for national debt, this stood at 39.9% of GDP when Gordon Brown became chancellor and was 36% when he succeeded Blair as prime minister. <br></p> <p>Debt interest payments amounted to 2% of GDP, which was slightly up on the trough of 1.8% reached in 2002-03 and 2003-04, but lower than the Conservatives ever managed between 1979 and 1997.<br></p> <p>The House of Commons analysis does not look at the interest rates the Labour government had to pay to finance its borrowing during the recession, but bond yields provide a clue as to whether the financial markets took fright at the rapid increase in the size of the deficit. There is no evidence that they did. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"890224a10bdf4045d1964a20bc086ebccce86048\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/890224a10bdf4045d1964a20bc086ebccce86048/0_0_460_230/460.jpg\" alt=\"Public sector net borrowing\" width=\"460\" height=\"230\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Yields on 10-year bonds rose in the runup to the 2010 election, but only marginally, from about 3.75% to 4%. They would have shot up a lot higher had the markets seriously thought the increase in the budget deficit to 11% of GDP was the result of Labour going on a spending spree.</p> <p>There is, therefore, scant evidence that it was Labour\u2019s fiscal irresponsibility that caused the crisis. As Corbyn has rightly noted, people did not queue outside Northern Rock branches for three days in September 2007 because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/02/labour-spending-worked-blair-brown-stealth\">Labour was spending too much on teachers and nurses</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c98059106e3fafa183b58972f068d2001cb0c4c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c98059106e3fafa183b58972f068d2001cb0c4c8/0_0_460_230/460.jpg\" alt=\"Public sector net debt\" width=\"460\" height=\"230\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It has been a catastrophic political blunder not to challenge the myth that Brown\u2019s government caused the crisis and the austerity that followed.

      "bodyText": "There was a surge in the sale of electric cars last year but the number leaving the forecourts is still dwarfed by traditional gas-guzzlers at a ratio of almost 50 to one. The high cost of the batteries that power the vehicles is a prime reason. Sheffield-based Faradion believes it has found a solution \u2013 new battery technology, the development of which has been spearheaded in the UK. \u201cFor an electric car, the cost of a battery is crudely the same as the cost of the rest. That is quite the wrong proportion for it to take off. So people are desperate to find ways to supply cheaper batteries,\u201d Faradion chairman, Chris Wright, said. In 2010, Wright and some colleagues pondered why large batteries used for electric cars and for energy storage from solar panels in the home were so expensive. The problem lay in the materials used to make them \u2013 specifically, those that contain lithium, of which there is a scarcity that drives up price. Wright said his team \u201cwould be on to a winner\u201d if they could find a material that contained a comparable but cheaper material to make the equivalent of lithium-ion batteries such as those used in mobile phones. The answer, they thought, was to use sodium, which has a similar chemistry to lithium. The base materials needed to produce a sodium-ion battery are significantly easier to source than those for lithium-ion batteries. The market for systems that use large-scale batteries is expected to grow as demand increases for home storage units for the energy generated from solar panels as well as for electric cars. \u201cWe set out to make sodium materials that worked in a simple electrochemical [battery] cell that behaved as well as if not better than some of the lithium systems. We were able to produce material which outperformed lithium-ion phosphate, which has until recently been the workhorse in automotive batteries.\u201d Last May Faradion revealed what it claims to be one of the most advanced sodium-ion batteries on the market, costing about 30% less than a lithium-ion equivalent. The company demonstrated the new technology in May at the headquarters of Williams Advanced Engineering in Oxfordshire using an electric bike. To the casual observer, the battery looks and performs in the same way as a lithium-ion battery. As well as being cheaper, sodium-ion batteries are easier to transport. Strict guidelines surround the transport of lithium-ion batteries because they can cause explosions if they short circuit. Last month Boeing warned passenger airlines against carrying bulk shipments of lithium-ion batteries. The sodium-ion batteries could be transported more quickly and easily without the safety concerns and logistical costs. Cheaper batteries could lead to goods such as electric cars and energy storage units falling in price, Wright said. \u201cThings will become available which weren\u2019t available before. People are very frequently annoyed with their batteries. Battery performance has really lagged behind the ambition and vision of people who are making other products. There is a lot of potential for batteries which tick the right boxes.\u201d After starting in the area with relatively few players, the sector is booming, said Wright. Faradion is now on trying to licence the technology. The problem with getting the batteries into cars is that it can take eight years from when the deal is done to vehicles going on sale, Wright said. For energy storage units however, the technology could be installed much quicker. Home energy generation has blossomed in the UK over the past four years, with an estimated 670,000 homes fitted with solar panels. Companies such as Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla aim to capitalise on this trend with Powerwall home energy storage batteries and a planned \u201cgigafactory\u201d in Nevada that will be the largest producer of lithium-ion batteries in the world by 2017. This is expected to force other battery manufacturers to seek alternatives in case they are priced out of the market, which is where Faradion aims to come in. \u201c[Other battery producers] are a natural target for us because they can use our materials and reduce their materials cost and find themselves able to compete with Tesla who have a large-scale plant,\u201d Wright said. A decade ago, solar panels for the home were prohibitively expensive but the reduction in costs now mean they have proliferated. \u201cI can see the same thing happen with energy storage,\u201d he said. Electric cars in the UK The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said in Janaury that sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles (AFVs) \u2013 including electric cars and hybrids \u2013 rose by 58% in 2014, with 51,739 new AFVs registered. AFV sales accounted for a market share of 2.1% in 2014 \u2013 up from 1.4% a year earlier.

The high street firm is investigating how hackers breached the IT systems of one of its UK divisions last week, an attack that also affected TalkTalk mobile customers. In a statement on Saturday, Carphone Warehouse revealed that the personal details of as many as 2.4 million customers may have been accessed by the hackers, including names, addresses, date of birth information and bank details. The credit card data of 90,000 customers \u201cmay also have been accessed\u201d, the company said, although this was stored in an encrypted form. Forensic experts from a firm specialising in cyber-attacks are investigating the breach, while Scotland Yard has been notified along with the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. \u201cThe firm is crawling all over our systems,\u201d said a spokesman for Carphone Warehouse. It is not known whether the National Crime Agency\u2019s national cyber crime unit, which leads the UK\u2019s response on the issue, is involved. Websites affected by the attack include OneStopPhoneShop.co.uk, e2save.com and Mobiles.co.uk, and Carphone Warehouse also provides services to TalkTalk Mobile, Talk Mobile, and to its own recently launched iD mobile network. Sebastian James, chief executive of Dixons Carphone, said: \u201cWe take the security of customer data extremely seriously, and we are very sorry people have been affected by this attack. We are, of course, informing anyone that may have been affected, and have put in place additional security measures.\u201d Carphone Warehouse, which is owned by Dixons Carphone following last year\u2019s \u00a33.7bn merger, also incorporates Currys and PC World. The retailer said the customer information of Currys and PC World, and \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of Carphone Warehouse customer data, was held on separate systems and had not been affected. Although the breach took place on Wednesday, the firm began contacting affected customers by email on Saturday, and said it had taken down affected websites as a precaution. \u201cWe and our partners are contacting all those customers who may have been affected to inform them of the breach and to give them advice to reduce any risk and minimise inconvenience,\u201d a statement said. Customers who suspected they were a victim of fraud were told to contact Action Fraud, the UK\u2019s national fraud and internet crime reporting centre. Customers reacted angrily on Twitter to the news of the potential security breach. CliffSull questioned how the company was reassuring customers. He tweeted: \u201cThis is the #Infosec department at #carphonewarehouse - sorry we can\u2019t take your call right now - all of our agents are busy just now ...\u201d Meanwhile, Matthew Tomlinson wrote: \u201cSo @CPWTweets has a data breach on the 5th August yet doesn\u2019t inform customers until the 8th.

Experts say that lost revenue is just one part of the problem, warning that loss of reputation or brand damage poses a serious threat to listed companies, with firms that suffer from security breaches often witnessing a fall in their share price. Others warn that, following a series of alarming hacks, a catastrophic attack is imminent. The RBS banking group recently revealed it had suffered a cyber-attack on its online services that left customers struggling to log on as monthly pay cheques were arriving in accounts.",

      "bodyText": "This week\u2019s 14-year prison sentence for Tom Hayes, the former UBS and Citigroup trader convicted of conspiracy to defraud, was a landmark moment in the cleanup of the City after the financial crisis. Hayes\u2019s offence \u2013 manipulating the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or Libor, to benefit his trading book and thus enlarge his bonus \u2013 played no role in any banking collapse. But his systematic attempts to cheat the financial system over a long period were part of a deeply rotten culture, as Mr Justice Cooke made clear in his sentencing remarks. \u201cThe seriousness of this offence in the context of the Libor benchmark and banking is hard to overstate,\u201d he said. \u201cHigh standards of probity are to be expected of those who operate in the banking system, whether they are bankers involved in dealing with deposits and the lending of money, or traders in an investment banking context. What this case has shown is the absence of that integrity which ought to characterise banking.\u201d It is impossible to calculate the losses suffered by counterparties to Hayes\u2019s trades, but Libor\u2019s importance in the financial system is immense. Its influence on interest rates extends to mortgage rates affecting millions. A long prison sentence is appropriate, even if 14 years strikes many as too severe, given that an armed robber might receive less. But the troubling aspect of the case is not the length of the sentence. It\u2019s this: Hayes could only have rigged Libor for so long if his bosses either failed to supervise him properly or preferred to ignore his tactics. Why weren\u2019t they also in the dock? The judge argued, fairly, that inadequate supervision should not deflect from the seriousness of Hayes\u2019s actions: \u201cThe fact that others were doing the same as you is no excuse, nor is the fact that your immediate managers saw the benefit of what you were doing and condoned it and embraced it, if not encouraged it.\u201d Yet a cultural cleanup of the banking and financial system will look like a depressing hunt for scapegoats if accountability extends only to the (admittedly well-paid) troops on the trading floor. This problem will not be eradicated easily, since the supervisors\u2019 plea of \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u201d is hard to counter. The regulatory answer is meant to be the new Senior Managers Regime, designed to ensure individual accountability by requiring that specific tasks and responsibilities are attached to named individuals. The regime, covering banks, brokers, investment firms and insurers, is intended to mean ignorance can no longer be an excuse. Senior individuals must show they were awake and took reasonable steps to prevent misbehaviour. That\u2019s the theory \u2013 and it is laudable. But we also want to see it work in practice and applied broadly. Already, one can hear grumbles from banks that their organisations are so complex, so big and, in some cases, so international that assigning responsibility to individuals is too hard. Regulators must resist such lobbying. If an institution is so complex that its management lines are blurred, it is probably too complex full stop; it should reorganise itself to fit the new regulatory approach. The other moral from the Hayes case is that traders at investment banks should be brought within the scope of the new regime. It is bizarre that this hasn\u2019t happened already. The principle should be quite simple: if, in the normal course of your duties, you can damage the integrity of the financial markets, you are a senior manager and thus covered by the accountability regime. Cultural change is not easy, and will require more effort than this week\u2019s welcome demonstration that serious cases of fraud on the trading floor can be prosecuted successfully. Greece may survive this crisis, but trouble could erupt elsewhere Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, appears to be making progress on a new \u20ac86bn bailout deal with his eurozone partners: a Brussels spokeswoman said on Friday that a new memorandum of understanding between the country and its creditors was being drafted. Much could still go wrong before Tsipras gets his money \u2013 and the compromises he will have to make may yet split his party and force a snap election. But even if Tsipras survives, the punitive nature of the deal he has struck with Germany and other creditors means Greece\u2019s economy, and public finances, will remain under severe pressure for years to come. And sadly, this is unlikely to be the last sovereign debt crisis the citizens of the eurozone will have to endure. Greece wasn\u2019t the only country that was able to take advantage of euro membership (and the markets\u2019 implicit assumption that Germany would ultimately bail out its neighbours) to borrow beyond what might otherwise have been its means. Several other member countries, including Italy and Portugal, have debt burdens that could yet prove unmanageable in the coming years \u2013 particularly if inflation remains weak and economic growth fails to bounce back strongly. And as Greece\u2019s experience has graphically shown, there is no mechanism for adjustment built into the euro system \u2013 until a crisis erupts, by which time it is already too late. Marchel Alexandrovich of City consultancy Jefferies pointed out in a recent note that even a modest disappointment on GDP growth (which boosts tax revenues) or inflation (which erodes the real value of debt) could leave the governments of Italy, Spain and even France deep in deficit. \u201cIn the world of fiscal arithmetic, there is no room for disappointment, either in terms of real GDP growth, or inflation. Which is precisely why the European Central Bank will remain extremely vigilant to any overseas developments that may derail the European recovery,\u201d he said. With long-term global interest rates expected to drift upwards as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy \u2013 perhaps as soon as September \u2013 he believes the ECB could be forced to expand its \u20ac60bn-a-month quantitative easing programme to prevent the eruption of a new crisis, perhaps many hundreds of miles away from Athens. Dearer dairy is the answer When there are winners, there are losers, too. While the nation continues to flock to discount supermarkets such as Lidl, Aldi and Asda, spare a thought this weekend for Britain\u2019s dairy farmers, who claim that those retailers\u2019 milk price cuts are forcing them out of business. Raise a cheer for Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose, lauded by protesting farmers as the only major chains to pay a sustainable price not just for their milk but for cream and cheese, too. Morrisons has been the focus of most of the farmers\u2019 protests, for refusing to guarantee a price for milk that covers the cost of production. Now the Bradford-based store has agreed to meet farmers to look at whether there\u2019s room for compromise. The protests have left a sour taste, but the willingness to meet is raising hopes of a sweeter outcome for Britain\u2019s milk producers \u2013 and perhaps a slightly more expensive pinta for the rest of us.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s August and the corporate news is drying up as Britain\u2019s bosses head for their holiday villas, so let\u2019s be thankful that Serco and G4S are around to enliven the week. Both security outsourcers will report half-year results and update the market on efforts to recover from scandals that forced out their previous managements. The biggest blow to their reputations was the government\u2019s discovery in 2013 that they had falsely charged taxpayers for electronically tagging prisoners who in some cases were back in prison or had died. The companies were temporarily banned from receiving new state contracts and had to pay multimillion-pound sums to the government. Serco gets more attention than its bigger rival because it has hired Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson, Rupert Soames, as chief executive. If anyone can ease relations with the government, Serco\u2019s biggest customer, surely Soames can. Serco\u2019s shares jumped in July when it said first-half trading was slightly better than expected. Analysts hoped that Soames\u2019s mildly optimistic tone masked a more fundamental improvement in the business. But its troubles have not abated. Among other problems, its migrant detention centres in Britain and Australia have been implicated in sexual assault allegations against staff. On Tuesday, there may be a clearer picture of whether, as one analyst put it, Soames is indeed at \u201cthe end of the beginning\u201d of getting a grip on his sprawling business. Can the caped crusader rescue Game Digital? Game Digital, which issues a trading statement on Tuesday, has had a rocky time since it returned to the stock market in June last year. In January the computer games retailer issued a profit warning on Christmas trading and in March it said 2015 had started slowly. Last year, UK spending on computer games rose 13% to more than \u00a33.9bn but competition was cut-throat. To lure customers, retailers gave away three or four good-quality games with consoles, cutting their margins over Christmas. (It\u2019s the games that make the money, not the consoles.) With that much free software, by the time March came around gamers were still glued to their Christmas purchases. Investors are waiting to hear whether customers have been lured from their bedrooms by new games such as Batman: Arkham Knight and what the balance of sales was between consoles and games. Analysts backing Game Digital point out that the company isn\u2019t just a games retailer. In March, it bought Multiplay, which organises tournaments either online or in stadiums. Believe it or not, thousands of people go to these events to watch other people competing at video games. It\u2019s a selling point of sorts. Cool summer leaves retailers in the shade The economy is growing, real wages are increasing and consumer borrowing is on the up. Those conditions should be great news for the high street, right? Figures for July from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) will shed some light on the matter on Tuesday, but the signs are mixed. A survey of midsize retailers last week from the accountants BDO showed the high street had its worst summer for six years, with fashion retailers hit particularly hard by the unusually cold start to the season. Consumers appear to be spending their extra cash on holidays, eating out and other experiences rather than on clothes and other goods. The prospect of rising interest rates also appears to be weighing on consumer confidence. By contrast, the BRC\u2019s retail sales monitor for June showed the strongest growth for 18 months, boosted by a heatwave and late summer splurge. A bright spot in the BRC\u2019s figures, which take in bigger chains than the BDO survey, has been growing sales of homewares. Will that trend continue with little pick-up in housing market transactions after the general election? The whole thing is complicated further by the plight of the big supermarkets challenged by Aldi and Lidl and the rise of online shopping.",
