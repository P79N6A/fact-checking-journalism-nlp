      "bodyText": "Australians should prepare for the \u201clongest and deepest\u201d housing downturn in the country\u2019s modern history as the full effects of tighter credit and rising mortgage rates are felt, a leading economist has warned. As figures released on Monday showed that house prices fell across Australia for the 11th consecutive month in August, Paul Dales, the chief economist for Capital Economics in Australia, said values could slide by 12% over the next four years. Shane Oliver, AMP Capital\u2019s chief economist, also weighed in, telling clients that property prices in Sydney and Melbourne may decline 15% by 2020, implying they have another 10% to lose, given the falls they have already recorded. The Reserve Bank will make its September decision on interest rates on Tuesday, when it is expected to keep the official cash rate steady at a record low 1.5%. Falling house prices were also blamed for a flatlining in retail spending in July. Figures released by the ABS on Monday showed that spending on non-food items fell, with an especially sharp fall in household goods (down 1.2%) and department store spending (down 1.9%). \u201cOngoing home price falls in Sydney and Melbourne will depress consumer spending as the wealth effect is now going in reverse,\u201d Oliver said. Data on the housing market from CoreLogic, released on Monday, showed prices were down 2.2% since their peak in September 2017, with Sydney, Melbourne and Perth leading the decline. Last month, five of Australia\u2019s eight capital cities recorded a fall in values: Sydney (-0.3%), Melbourne (-0.6%), Brisbane (-0.2%), Perth (-0.6%), and Hobart (-0.1%). The only cities where dwelling values edged higher were Adelaide (0.3%), Darwin (0.1%) and Canberra (0.5%). Over the past 12 months, prices in Sydney have fallen 5.6% while Melbourne has seen a decline of 1.6%. Economists are now warning property prices will decline for a number of years, albeit slowly. Dales says the housing downturn has already lasted longer than the 12-month average of Australia\u2019s seven previous housing downturns since 1980, but the price declines in this downturn have been the smallest on record. \u201cOverall, a 12% fall in house prices spread over four years is unlikely to cause too many problems,\u201d he said. \u201cBut by prompting households to spend more cautiously, it will probably contribute to GDP growth being closer to 2.5% over the next few years rather than the rates of 3% or more the RBA is banking on.\u201d \u201cWith the full effects of tighter credit conditions and rising mortgage rates yet to be felt, the current housing downturn will probably end up being the longest and deepest in Australia\u2019s modern history.\u201d Oliver noted that prices in Sydney rose 72% over five years to their August 2017 high, and Melbourne prices rose 57% over five years to their November 2017 high, so the current price declines are taking place in a context of recently strong capital gains. But he expects the declines, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, have a while to go. \u201cTighter bank lending standards, poor affordability, rising unit supply, falling price growth expectations and FOMO (fear of missing out) risking turning into FONGO (fear of not getting out) for investors, are pushing prices down in cities which have seen strong gains since 2012,\u201d he said. \u201cA crash landing remains unlikely in the absence of much higher interest rates or unemployment, but it\u2019s a risk given the difficulty in gauging how severe the tightening in bank lending standards in the face of the royal commission will get and how investors will respond as their capital growth expectations collapse at a time when net rental yields are around 1-2%.\u201d Tim Lawless, CoreLogic\u2019s head of research, said weaker housing market conditions can be explained by a variety of factors, \u201cforemost of which is the tighter credit environment which has slowed market activity, especially amongst investors.\u201d \u201cFewer active buyers has led to higher inventory levels and reduced competition in the market. Collectively, these factors have been compounded by affordability challenges, reduced foreign investment and a rise in housing supply,\u201d he said. He said the price declines may depress consumer spending because the \u201cwealth effect\u201d is now working in reverse, so homeowners will be less inclined to allow their savings rate to decline in coming years. Retail sales figures, also released on Monday, show retail sales were flat in July, dampening the momentum of a reasonable June quarter. \u201cSales growth is being dragged by margin compression, tighter financial conditions for households, and falling housing turnover,\u201d JP Morgan\u2019s Ben Jarman said.",

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday, the latest GDP figures will be released. And while growth in the economy is expected to have slowed it should still be at a level that does not pose too many early concerns for the new treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. But the latest series of data in the run-up to the national accounts highlights that the economy is far from purring along. Being treasurer is a step up from pretty much every other portfolio. No doubt this past week, as he gets ready for the latest GDP figures, Frydenberg has been going over every acronym he is likely to encounter. No new treasurer wants to replicate the performance of John Kerin who in describing the national accounts forgot what GOS stood for (gross operating surplus \u2013 a proxy for company profits). When your time in the job has been short and you have few laurels to rest on, such slips, which in reality mean little, have a tendency to get over emphasised. But the new treasurer\u2019s life will be more difficult than just having to remember niche economic jargon. And while he has suggested he will be seeking advice from Peter Costello, the latest lot of economic data suggest that now is certainly not a time when a treasurer can just lie back and enjoy the boom. Monday\u2019s retail trade figures were just the latest in a series of pretty underwhelming numbers that reflects households\u2019 lack of rising real income. The seasonally adjusted figures showed zero growth in July, but the trend result was slightly better at 0.3%. The annual growth figures show a slightly better picture, with the trend rate of 3.2% the best for a year: But when we look at the monthly growth of retail trade across each sector, it is clear that there has been a slowing over the past six months \u2013 one that will likely increase should others banks follow Westpac and increase their mortgage rates: The problem for the new treasurer is not just that households are not spending money in a manner that will feed into solid economic growth figures, but that the situation is quite varied across the nation. Growth is strongest in New South Wales and Victoria \u2013 thought both are now below their peak growth periods of six to nine months ago. Queensland and South Australia have flat but weak growth and Western Australia is absolutely dreadful. Only Tasmania is showing any signs of increased performance: And while household spending (at least on retail goods) is just limping along, neither is there much joy to be found for the new treasurer from the business side of things. Over the past year the collapse in investment from the end of the mining boom seemed to have finished. But while things are not getting worse, there is little sign of things getting better. The latest private new capital expenditure figures, which covers investment in things such as building and structures and new machinery and equipment, showed a 0.6% fall in the June quarter in trend terms (the seasonally adjusted fall was even worse at 2.5%) and annual growth of a mere 1.3%: And while the continued fall in mining investment might not be unexpected \u2013 although it is disappointing given it did appear that things were about to improve \u2013 the drop off in the growth of investment in the non-mining sectors is the most concerning: Specifically, the peak of annual growth in the investment in new machinery and equipment (which is dominated by the non-mining sectors) is disappointing given it appears the peak in this latest cycle did not get above 10%, and demonstrates the period we are in remains very much depressed compared to the mining boom years: And neither can the new treasurer get much joy from the outlook for the year ahead. The latest estimate for investment in the 2018-19 financial year shows a slight fall of 1.3% from the same estimate this time last year and shows no growth at all in the non-mining sectors: It does not suggest much of a surge in employment in the private sector is about to come our way. Yes, the latest business indicators did show a 4.5% increase in total wages paid over the past year, but that is due to an increase in employment more than an increase in wages growth. And the biggest increase came from the predominately public-driven health and social services sector. But one area the treasurer will not have to worry about too much is tax revenue. The latest figures showed very strong company profits \u2013 driven largely by a 19% growth in mining profits: Wednesday\u2019s GDP figures are expected to show a slight slowing of growth from the quite decent March quarter figures. But even with the good news of the continued growth of the overall economy, the retail trade and private capital expenditure figures show that the issues for the new treasurer of weak investment and household spending are quite entrenched and will be tough to address in the short time he has until the next election.

      "bodyText": "Kweku Adoboli, the former trader who was found guilty of causing a $2.3bn (\u00a31.8bn) financial loss, has been detained by the Home Office as preparations for his deportation to Ghana begin. Adoboli, 38, was jailed in 2012 for the fraud, which was the biggest in UK history. He was freed after serving half of his seven-year sentence. The former trader, who is Ghanaian, has not lived in Ghana since he was four years old and describes himself as British. Foreign nationals sentenced to more than four years are automatically considered for deportation unless they can show that there are compelling reasons to allow them to stay in the country. Adoboli, who has been living in Scotland with friends since his release, was detained today when he made his fortnightly check-in at a police station in Livingston. He was taken to Dungavel, an immigration removal centre in Scotland. A letter seen by the Guardian from Home Office minister Caroline Nokes has confirmed the government\u2019s intention to deport him from the UK to Ghana, his country of birth. Since leaving custody in June 2015, Kweku has participated in dozens of events, speaking to thousands of students, and has worked with several organisations involved in improving corporate governance and compliance within the financial industry. He has appealed to the home secretary, Sajid Javid, not to deport him because of his longstanding ties with the UK and the fact that he is working hard to educate people to avoid making the same mistakes he made at UBS. His solicitor, Jacqueline McKenzie, said the case raised wider issues about the deportation of offenders who have grown up in the UK and are settled here. \u201cThis is a really unfair situation for Kweku,\u201d she said. A court recently denied him permission for a judicial review of the deportation proceedings, and granted a request by the Home Office to be allowed to deport him even if he renews his application for a review. His MP, Hannah Bardell, has appealed to the Home Office to stay removal proceedings against Adoboli, but in a letter dated 24 August, Nokes wrote that the Home Office was satisfied its actions had been proportionate and that all the issues raised, such as the length of time Adoboli had lived in the UK, had been fully considered. \u201cAs such, the arrangements for Mr Adoboli\u2019s deportation to Ghana will proceed,\u201d she wrote. Adoboli has launched a CrowdJustice campaign to raise funds to help pay his legal bills. Adoboli\u2019s friend Nick Hopewell-Smith said: \u201cKweku has already served a swingeing term for mistakes that he made on behalf of his employer, UBS, and never for his own benefit. To punish him a second time with deportation from his real home is inhumane and clearly unjust.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAll foreign nationals who are given a custodial sentence will be considered for removal. Foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crimes in the UK should be in no doubt of our determination to deport them and we have removed more than 42,800 foreign offenders since 2010. \u201cWe do not routinely comment on individual cases.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers face a difficult autumn as the Brexit deadline looms and Donald Trump\u2019s trade sanctions hit exports, according to figures for the sector in August. A survey of manufacturers has found that growth slowed last month to its lowest level since July 2016, dragged down by a shock fall in exports. The figures indicate that the sector, which suffered a fall in output during the first two quarters of the year, could remain in recession for the rest of 2018. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has blamed Brexit uncertainty for the recent failure of UK firms to capitalise on a strong expansion in global demand. The Liberal Democrat leader and former business secretary Vince Cable said on Monday he agreed that Brexit was to blame for a loss of momentum that has resulted in Britain slipping down the international league table of manufacturing powerhouses. \u201cIt should be a good time for UK manufacturing, particularly with a weaker pound. The fact it isn\u2019t speaks volumes about the uncertainty being created by the Conservative government\u2019s incompetent handling of Brexit.\u201d The IHS Markit/Cips purchasing managers index (PMI), which measures activity across the industry, dropped from 53.8 in July to 52.8, the lowest since the referendum vote to leave the European Union, which rocked consumer and business confidence in the months afterwards. Manufacturers\u2019 optimism about the outlook for the year ahead receded to a 22-month low and the demand for workers weakened. Meanwhile, the PMI export balance fell into negative territory \u2013 from 53.0 to 47.4 \u2013 which matched the lowest since October 2014. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. Analysts said the industry\u2019s situation was likely to worsen over the coming months as Brexit uncertainty and the tit-for-tat trade sanctions triggered by the US president\u2019s steel tariffs began to bite further. Andrew Wishart, an economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said there was little sign of a recovery in the manufacturing sector. \u201cThe main reason for the fall in the headline orders was a contraction in export orders, suggesting that the possibility of a no-deal exit from the EU in March and a moderation in global growth is starting to weigh more heavily on the sector,\u201d he said. \u201cOverall, while the survey doesn\u2019t suggest that manufacturing will continue to contract in the thirs quarter, there is little sign of a strong rebound.\u201d George Buckley, the chief UK economist at Nomura, said the latest decline was part of a trend going back 10 months to last November when the PMI stood at 58. \u201cThere are likely a number of causes for the sharp decline in export orders. First, the slowdown in the global economy over the past year amid concerns about protectionism, higher oil prices, financial strains in China, rising European populism and the risks of a broader emerging market crisis. \u201cSecond, there\u2019s Brexit \u2013 there remains much uncertainty about the final outcome of the Brexit talks \u2013 not only whether the EU will accept the government\u2019s plans, which looks unlikely in their current form after comments from EU officials over the past week, but also whether those plans will be acceptable to UK politicians (again, passing a vote in parliament is set to be a struggle, given comments from the pro-Brexit lobby over the weekend),\u201d he said. Rob Dobson, a director at the survey compiler IHS Markit, warned that output and new orders had slowed and the pace of job creation slumped to near-stagnation. \u201cBased on its historical relationship with official data, the latest PMI report is broadly consistent with zero growth in manufacturing production, meaning the sector will likely fail to provide any support to the wider UK economy in the third quarter. \u201cAlthough slower growth of domestic demand contributed to manufacturing\u2019s weak performance, the main constraint was the trend in new export business. Foreign demand declined for the first time since April 2016, despite the weakness of sterling, amid reports of slower global economic growth and the increasingly uncertain trading environment. Inflows of new work from both domestic and overseas sources will need to strengthen if manufacturing is to show renewed vigour in the coming months,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "And finally... Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 closed the day almost 1% higher at 7,504, a gain of 72 points. The weaker pound can take the \u2018credit\u2019 -- sterling is still languishing almost a cent lower today at $1.2878. It\u2019s down a similar amount against the euro too, following today\u2019s weak factory growth report. The City continues to feel Brexit jitteriness, as the government rebutted Boris Johnson\u2019s latest attack on the Chequers plan. Downing Street insisted that Britain needed \u201cserious leadership with a serious plan\u201d -- a coded way of saying it didn\u2019t need the former foreign secretary\u2019s particular talents. Here\u2019s David Madden of CMC Markets on sterling\u2019s bad day: GBP/USD had a big sell-off today after the UK posted disappointing manufacturing figures. The manufacturing PMI report fell to 52.8 in August \u2013 a two year low. The update comes as there is still uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Michel Barnier, the EU negotiator, said he is \u2018strongly\u2019 opposed to Prime Minister May\u2019s trading proposals. Meanwhile Mrs May, will not comprise on the plans she mapped out at Chequers. Once again, the water has been muddied regarding the discussions, and while there is no easy end in sight, pressure is likely to remain on the pound. And on that note, goodnight! GW The US financial markets are quiet today, as traders celebrate Labor Day. So here\u2019s a quick recap. Manufacturers in Asia and Europe have suffered a drop in growth, as anxiety over the US-China trade war grows. Chinese factories posted their weakest expansion in 14 months in August, due to the fifth drop in exports in a row. Economists fear that the tariffs imposed on Washington are hurting the Chinese economy, and forcing firms to cut jobs. British manufacturers also had a lacklustre August, with growth dropping to a 25-month low. Some purchasing managers cited Brexit uncertainty, with no decision on the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU. Eurozone factories also slowed last month, led by Spain and Italy. With Brexit pressures building in Westminster, and in Brussels, the pound slid by almost a cent against the US dollar - back below $1.29. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is coming under more pressure to say whether he might extend his term beyond June 2019. MPs will want answers when the BoE testify to the Treasury committee tomorrow afternoon. Brazil has bucked the trend of generally disappointing data today, with manufacturing growth hitting a four-month high. However, the recent slump in the value of the real (amid a political corruption scandal) is pushing up import costs. ...and here\u2019s the latest on TSB\u2019s IT problems. Here\u2019s our news story about Mark Carney\u2019s future: The drop in the pound has given shares in London a boost. The FTSE 100 has gained around 1% today, currently up 68 points at 7501. This lifts the blue-chip index from the four-month low struck on Friday afternoon. A weak sterling pushes up the value of overseas earnings for the multinationals that make up much of the Footsie. The pound is also sliding against the euro, down almost one eurocent at \u20ac1.108. That means one euro is worth 90.27p, close to last month\u2019s one-year high. Rupert Harrison of asset manager BlackRock suggests investors should brace for more Brexit twists and turns: The pound is continuing to slide on the currency markets, and is now down almost one cent at $1.2875 against the US dollar. This morning\u2019s weak factory data hasn\u2019t helped, but the key driver appears to be Brexit worries. Today\u2019s losses wipe out last Wednesday\u2019s rally, sparked by EU negotiator Michel Barnier promising to offer Britain an \u201cunprecedented deal\u201d. Barnier sounded less optimistic over the weekend, saying he \u201cstrongly opposed\u201d the UK\u2019s proposal of a free trade area for goods underpinned by a common rulebook. With leave-supporting Conservative MPs also denouncing Theresa May\u2019s \u2018Chequers agreement\u2019 from the other side, the City is getting edgier. David Lowe, head of international trade at law firm Gowling WLG, explains why: \u201cThe fluctuating value of the pound is frequently attributed to an individual aspect of the UK\u2019s political and economic infrastructure \u2013 which steps away from the reality that it is always a basket of issues and trends. The drop in the pound this morning might be as a result of the issue of the statistics for UK manufacturing, but they will also be factoring in announcements over the weekend from May, Barnier and Johnson, and the growing concern over recent months about the risk of a hard or crash Brexit. The markets are betting the outcome of Brexit negotiations will be that the UK will be poorer as a result.\u201d Long-suffering customers at TSB have a special dose of back-to-school blues today. The UK bank carried out some \u201cplanned maintenance\u201d in the early hours of Saturday morning. And unfortunately (but alas not surprisingly) some customers then found they couldn\u2019t access internet banking or get their mobile app to work. TSB tweeted early this morning that the problem was fixed, only to later admit that it wasn\u2019t. This must be gutting for customers who endured TSB\u2019s IT meltdown in April, when services were disrupted for weeks. A few days ago, TSB fell to the bottom of MoneySavingExpert\u2019s customer service league table -- today\u2019s disruption won\u2019t help it recover... Speculation has been swirling this morning that Mark Carney could agree to stay on longer as Bank of England governor. This particular \u2018news hare\u2019 has been scampering since last week, when the Evening Standard reported that Carney has been asked to hang on until 2020. He\u2019s currently due to depart in June 2019, meaning the government needs to pick a successor soon. But the BBC are now reporting that the Treasury and the BBC are discussing \u201cdelaying\u201d Carney\u2019s departure, as it\u2019s hard to appoint a successor in the current Brexit uncertainty. Over in Westminster, Theresa May\u2019s spokesperson has been asked about the situation at the regular lobby briefing. He replied that: The governor has said that he intends to step down in 2019. That is still the plan. Reading between the lines, that doesn\u2019t rule out an extension -- could the governor perhaps extend his innings by a few more months? The City would probably welcome such a move - it would eliminate one (small) element of Brexit uncertainty. Leave supporters wouldn\u2019t be pleased, though, given Carney\u2019s many warnings about the impact of leaving the EU. Carney is testifying to parliament\u2019s Treasury committee on Tuesday, so he\u2019s bound to be quizzed about the situation. Popcorn at the ready! Carney The slide in UK factory growth has brought the City back to earth with a bump after the summer holidays. Stephen Cooper, UK head of industrial manufacturing at KPMG, says the PMI report has \u201ca bit of back to school dread\u201d about it. Optimism has fallen whilst job creation is virtually at a standstill, with cuts by larger businesses neutralised by job growth in SMEs. \u201cTogether with export orders \u2013 also at a 25 month low despite continued sterling weakness \u2013 these figures are particularly concerning against the backdrop of global trade wars and increasing uncertainty around Brexit \u2013 both of which will be weighing on businesses.\u201d UK manufacturing will keep struggling until a Brexit transition deal has been hammered out, warns Helena Sans, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays. Here\u2019s her take on today\u2019s factory PMI: \u201cWith such an underwhelming set of data, the only positive to pull out is that the index still remains in positive territory. The improving performance we\u2018ve seen in exports over the past two years, boosted by the weakness in sterling, took a worrying hit last month. Political and economic uncertainty is clearly impacting manufacturers investment intentions but one thing that is certain is in order to increase exports and drive growth, what manufacturers need to see sooner rather than later is a Brexit transition deal to avoid the risk of prolonging a more cautious and tentative approach to investment from the sector.\u201d Lee McDarby, Corporate IP Managing Director at foreign exchange firm moneycorp, says confusion over Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU is hurting factories - and hampering new investment. He says: \u201cThe news that manufacturing is at a two year low and well below forecast will come as a shock to markets after months of steady, if unspectacular, growth. Ordinarily the weak Pound should lead to increasing demand for British manufactured products abroad, however this has not materialised. Instead, manufacturers are being held back by the same lack of confidence in the economy that is suppressing Sterling. It\u2019s tough to nail new orders from overseas when you have no certainty over what trading rules will look like in six months\u2019 time. UK factories are grappling with \u201csuppressed domestic demand and a slowdown in output\u201d, explains Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. He adds: \u201cAs we approach the final months of negotiations on Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, firms are continuing to plan for all outcomes. Investment in automation and robotics are key for many who are looking to tackle productivity and mitigate labour shortages. \u201cHowever, there remains some anxiety among manufacturers with exposure to consumer markets. Sluggish wage growth has blunted spending power and the current woe in the retail sector is weakening demand for new stock.\u201d The pound had already been under pressure this morning, due to Brexit worries. The slowdown in UK manufacturing has now dragged it back below $1.29, down 0.5% today. Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, is also alarmed by the slowdown across UK factories. \u201cFears for a stalling manufacturing sector took a step closer to becoming a reality this month with the most disappointing performance for two years. \u201cThe lifeline of strong export orders enjoyed since May 2016 dried up, as the attraction of a weaker pound was not enough to sustain the momentum..... With a subdued global economy threatened by escalating trade wars and Brexit uncertainty making its mark, it\u2019s unclear where future opportunities to sustain the health of the sector will come from. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s factory growth has hit a two-year low amid Brexit uncertainty and the US-China trade war. The UK Manufacturing PMI has fallen to just 52.8 in August, down from 53.8 in July. That\u2019s the weakest reading in 25 months, and shows the sector moved closer to stagnation last month (any reading over 50 shows growth). Markit, which compiles the survey, says that new export orders fell last month for the first time in over two years. This dragged job creation down to near-stagnation, while business optimism hit a 22-month low. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, says UK manufacturing looks \u201cincreasingly lacklustre\u201d. He blames a slowdown in the global economy, and worries over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. Dobson writes: \u201cAlthough slower growth of domestic demand contributed to manufacturing\u2019s weak performance, the main constraint was the trend in new export business. Foreign demand declined for the first time since April 2016, despite the weakness of sterling, amid reports of slower global economic growth and the increasingly uncertain trading environment. Inflows of new work from both domestic and overseas sources will need to strengthen if manufacturing is to show renewed vigour in the coming months. \u201cLooking ahead, manufacturers\u2019 optimism about the outlook for the year ahead has been receding in recent months and is now at a 22-month low. While a hoped-for improvement in new export order growth and new product launches are forecast to stimulate future expansion, manufacturers are also expressing rising concerns about the uncertain backdrop of Brexit.\u201d As a result, UK factories may not provide any economic growth this quarter, Markit fears. More reaction to follow.... Moritz Degler of Oxford Economics is concerned by Italy\u2019s factory slowdown: Trade war jitters have also hit the eurozone. Manufacturing growth across the single currency region slowed in August, according to data firm Markit. Eurozone factory exports only grew at their slowest rate in two years, as demand for goods tailed off. Here are the key findings from Markit\u2019s monthly survey of eurozone purchasing managers: Final Eurozone Manufacturing PMI at 54.6 in August, down from 55.1 in July. Firmer output growth, but new orders rise at slowest rate for two years Concerns about tariffs and global trade weigh on confidence. The report also shows that Ireland and the Netherlands had a strong month, while Spain and Italy struggled: Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says eurozone manufacturers are growing more anxious: \u201cWorries about trade wars and the damaging impact of tariffs, as well as Brexit and other political worries, all contributed to a dampening of business optimism about the year ahead. Business expectations were the second-lowest since November 2015. Economics consultancy Pantheon blame the US tariffs for the slowdown in China\u2019s factories last month. So far, America and China have imposed 25% tariffs on $50bn of each others goods. Later this week, Donald Trump could sign off levies on another $200bn of Chinese imports, which would escalate the trade war significantly. In another blow, Turkey\u2019s inflation rate has surged as the slump in the lira hits consumers. Prices rose by a painful 17.9% in August, up from 15.9% in July. That\u2019s the highest level since 2003, and shows that the Turkish currency crisis is causing real damage. Typically such blistering price rises would prompt an interest rate hike to curb demand. But Turkey\u2019s central bank may be unwilling to hike borrowing costs at its next meeting, in a fortnight\u2019s time, due to president Erdo\u011fan\u2019s firm opposition to high interest rates. The lira wobbled late last week when a deputy governor resigned; Erdo\u011fan will name his replacement, under new powers approved this year. Ouch! Turkey\u2019s factory sector had a torrid time in August, as the country\u2019s currency crisis hurt its economy. The Turkish manufacturing PMI, just released, fell to just 46.3 last month from 51.0 in July. That drags the sector straight back into contraction. The Turkish lira slumped dramatically last month, from 5 lira to the US dollar on 1 August to over 7 lira/$1 a fortnight later. This did make exports more competitive, but also sent import costs surging, drove up the cost of repaying loans in foreign currencies, and prompted fears of capital controls or an IMF bailout. Not good for business. The Istanbul Chamber of Industry, which compiles the report, says (with a touch of understatement: August was a month of challenging business conditions for manufacturing firms in Istanbul. Weakness of the Turkish lira led to strong inflationary pressures, and contributed to slowdowns in both output and new orders. Currency weakness did have the effect of helping to support new export orders, which increased fractionally during August. China isn\u2019t the only country to experience a manufacturing slowdown last month. South Korea\u2019s factory sector shank for the sixth month in a row. Its manufacturing PMI came in at 49.9, up from 48.3 in July, but still in contraction territory (just). That may show that the US-China trade war is sending ripples of uncertainty into other markets. China\u2019s export situation is currently \u201cgrim\u201d, warns Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong of CEBM Group. He fears today\u2019s slowdown in China\u2019s factory growth could be a prelude to a wider slowdown. \u201cGenerally speaking, the manufacturing sector continued to weaken amid soft demand, even though the supply side was still stable. Prices of industrial products were underpinned by a proactive fiscal policy, and environmental protection policies that had limited some factory production. I don\u2019t think that stable supply can be sustained amid weak demand. In addition, the worsening employment situation is likely to have an impact on consumption growth. China\u2019s economy is now facing relatively obvious downward pressure.\u201d Chinese factory bosses are growing increasingly worried about the trade war with America, data firm Caixin says. Optimism regarding future production remained relatively subdued in August, with confidence little-changed from June\u2019s recent low. Positive forecasts were generally linked to expectations of rising client demand. However, concerns over the ongoing China-US trade war and softer demand conditions weighed on overall sentiment. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover how the world\u2019s manufacturers fared in August, in the face of trade war anxiety and worries over the global economy. And the early signs aren\u2019t good -- growth in China\u2019s manufacturing sector has slowed to its lowest level in over a year. Export orders shrank in August, for the fifth month in a row, and factory bosses cut staff. Import costs also jumped sharply, as firms paid the price of the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed on some US goods entering China. This dragged the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) down to 50.6 in August from July\u2019s 50.8. That\u2019s the weakest level since June 2017, and worryingly close to the 50-point mark that shows stagnation. Although output did increase, new orders rose at the slowest rate since May 2017, as Caixin explains: Latest data indicated that demand conditions softened, with total new business rising at the slowest pace for 15 months. Weaker foreign demand contributed to the softer increase in overall new work, with export sales declining for the fifth month in a row. This slowdown suggests that the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by Washington this year, and the threat of further levies this autumn, are now hurting China\u2019s economy. Later today we learn how Europe\u2019s factories performed. The UK manufacturing PMI is expected to dip a little to 53.9 from 54 in July. That would be a pretty solid performance. Also coming up Italy is on the radar after rating agency Fitch lowered its outlook on Italian debt to \u201cnegative\u201d last week. The country\u2019s populist government has hit back, saying it will make a \u201chistoric choice\u201d between what citizens need and what ratings agencies say should be done. That\u2019s likely to leave investors on edge. Argentina\u2019s government is expected to announce sweeping spending cuts on Monday, in an attempt to tackle the currency crisis that had sent the peso plunging his year. The pound may also come under pressure, after UK PM Theresa May (once again) ruled out a second Brexit referendum, and eurosceptic MPs attacked her Chequers plan.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mark Carney will face questions from MPs over his future at the Bank of England on Tuesday amid mounting speculation he could extend his stay as governor in order to guide the British economy through Brexit. Carney is expected to answer questions on Tuesday afternoon over his future when facing MPs on the House of Commons Treasury committee, which is tasked with scrutinising appointments at the central bank. Several members of the committee have told the Guardian that keeping the governor \u2013 who is due to leave in June next year \u2013 would help smooth Britain\u2019s departure from the EU on 29 March. Although the meeting is scheduled to discuss the Bank raising interest rates last month, Stewart Hosie, a Scottish National party MP on the committee, said: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a surprise at all if a member would ask [about Carney\u2019s future].\u201d \u201cCarney has done a very good job in what, in many cases, have been very difficult economic circumstances. There would be a lot of merit in the chancellor asking him to extend his term should that be the decision the chancellor were to take,\u201d he added. However, Downing Street played down reports on Monday, suggesting Carney could stay until 2020, saying it was still the plan for him to leave in 2019 after six years in charge at the central bank. Speaking to reporters after the BBC said the Treasury was in talks with Carney over extending his contract, Theresa May\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cHe has said he is stepping down in June 2019. The Treasury have said we\u2019ll start recruiting for a new governor. And that is the plan.\u201d Asked if Carney had done a good job at Threadneedle Street and should therefore be kept for longer than planned, the spokesman added: \u201cThe prime minister thinks the governor has done a good job.\u201d The Queen appoints the Bank of England governor, but on the recommendation of the prime minister and the Treasury, which will lead the recruitment process under Philip Hammond. Carney has also attracted the ire of leading Brexiters, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, for his repeated warnings over the economic consequences of Brexit. Carney has said the chance of a no-deal Brexit is uncomfortably high and would be highly undesirable. Rees-Mogg, who has been a staunch critic of the governor, told the Guardian last week the Treasury should not extend his tenure. \u201cCarney refused [an eight-year term as governor], accepting a shorter one, which was then extended. To change it again would be ridiculous,\u201d he said. Investors in the City of London have however responded favourably to the idea of the governor remaining in his post, arguing it would help remove an additional layer of uncertainty about Britain\u2019s economic policy after leaving the EU. They have also praised Carney\u2019s ability to calm financial markets, which could be rocked by the UK crashing out without a deal. Colin Jackson, an analyst at the stockbroker Goodbody, said extending his term would be welcome. \u201cIt removes an element of uncertainty over the effectiveness of the Bank of England to implement appropriate policy in a post-Brexit world, while it would also reduce the headache faced by the Treasury as it fights for a soft Brexit within the UK government,\u201d he said. Speculation over Carney\u2019s future first arose after a report in the diary pages of the London Evening Standard last week, suggesting the Treasury was struggling to find an appropriate replacement and had asked him to stay. Officials said last week they \u201cdid not recognise the reporting\u201d by the newspaper. Although the diary pages are usually reserved for gossip from around London and Westminster, the newspaper is edited by the former chancellor, George Osborne, who was responsible for hiring Carney in November 2012. The Bank of England declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Treasury said: \u201cThere is no update from us on governor recruitment plans, we will announce details in due course.\u201d",

Several members of the committee have told the Guardian that<em> </em>keeping the governor \u2013 who is due to leave in June next year \u2013 would help <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/28/speculation-mounts-over-carneys-future-at-bank-of-england\">smooth Britain\u2019s departure from the EU on 29 March</a>.</p> <p>Although the meeting is scheduled to discuss the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/02/bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates\">Bank raising interest rates last month</a>, Stewart Hosie, a Scottish National party MP on the committee, said: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a surprise at all if a member would ask [about Carney\u2019s future].\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/28/keep-carney-and-carry-on-for-brexit-britain\">Keep Carney and carry on for Brexit Britain | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cCarney has done a very good job in what, in many cases, have been very difficult economic circumstances. There would be a lot of merit in the chancellor asking him to extend his term should that be the decision the chancellor were to take,\u201d he added.</p> <p>However, Downing Street played down reports on Monday, suggesting Carney could stay until 2020, saying it was still the plan for him to leave in 2019 after six years in charge at the central bank.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters after the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45394290\">BBC said the Treasury was in talks</a> with Carney over extending his contract, Theresa May\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cHe has said he is stepping down in June 2019. The Treasury have said we\u2019ll start recruiting for a new governor. And that is the plan.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if Carney had done a good job at Threadneedle Street and should therefore be kept for longer than planned, the spokesman added: \u201cThe prime minister thinks the governor has done a good job.\u201d The Queen appoints the Bank of England governor, but on the recommendation of the prime minister and the Treasury, which will lead the recruitment process under Philip Hammond.</p> <p>Carney has also attracted the ire of leading Brexiters, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, for his repeated warnings over the economic consequences of Brexit. Carney has said the chance of a no-deal Brexit is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/03/mark-carney-says-risk-of-a-no-deal-brexit-is-uncomfortably-high\">uncomfortably high and would be highly undesirable</a>.</p> <p>Rees-Mogg, who has been a staunch critic of the governor, told the Guardian<em> </em>last week the Treasury should not extend his tenure. \u201cCarney refused [an eight-year term as governor], accepting a shorter one, which was then extended. To change it again would be ridiculous,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Investors in the City of London have however responded favourably to the idea of the governor remaining in his post, arguing it would help remove an additional layer of uncertainty about Britain\u2019s economic policy after leaving the EU. They have also praised Carney\u2019s ability to calm financial markets, which could be rocked by the UK crashing out without a deal.</p> <p>Colin Jackson, an analyst at the stockbroker Goodbody, said extending his term would be welcome. \u201cIt removes an element of uncertainty over the effectiveness of the Bank of England to implement appropriate policy in a post-Brexit world, while it would also reduce the headache faced by the Treasury as it fights for a soft Brexit within the UK government,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speculation over Carney\u2019s future first arose after a <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/the-londoner-bank-chief-carney-asked-to-stay-a-year-a3921451.html\">report in the diary pages of the London Evening Standard</a> last week, suggesting the Treasury was struggling to find an appropriate replacement and had asked him to stay. Officials said last week they \u201cdid not recognise the reporting\u201d by the newspaper.</p> <p>Although the diary pages are usually reserved for gossip from around London and Westminster, the newspaper is edited by the former chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/31/george-osborne-edit-evening-standard\">George Osborne</a>, who was responsible for hiring Carney in November 2012.</p> <p>The Bank of England declined to comment.

Others who had managed to log in said they had been unable to move money between TSB accounts. Many were furious that the company had claimed the problems, which followed a routine maintenance upgrade, had been fixed when they had not. Others described the latest disruption as \u201cbeyond a joke\u201d. TSB is still recovering from an IT disaster in April, when customers were left without access to online banking services for several weeks. The bank has 1.9 million customers who use its digital banking services. A spokesperson told the Financial Times \u201cthousands\u201d of customers had been affected. \u201cWe\u2019re really sorry that some of our customers are experiencing intermittent issues,\u201d the bank said.

Last week, it emerged that TSB had plummeted from fourth to last place in the latest banking customer service poll by the website Money Saving Expert. The original IT problems occurred when customer data was migrated from an IT system operated by Lloyds Banking Group, which used to own the bank, to a new one managed by its Spanish owner, Sabadell. In June, the TSB chief executive, Paul Pester, said 2,200 customers had had fraudulent attempts to access their accounts since the difficulties surfaced. More than 12,500 customers have left the bank since April. TSB received more than 100,000 complaints and said in July that the IT meltdown had cost \u00a3176.4m and pushed it to a half-year loss.",

      "bodyText": "WPP, the world\u2019s largest marketing services group, has officially appointed Mark Read as its new chief executive. Read, 51, has been jointly running WPP on an interim basis since Sir Martin Sorrell resigned in controversial and acrimonious circumstances in April. WPP\u2019s board was unanimous in the decision to appoint Read, who had been tipped as the favourite for the job. Roberto Quarta, the WPP chairman, praised Read\u2019s \u201cwise and effective stewardship\u201d of the company over the summer months that \u201cleft us with no doubt that he is the right leader for this company\u201d. Quarta said: \u201cThe board carried out a rigorous selection process, assessing internal and external candidates. [Read] has an intimate understanding of the business, he enjoys very strong internal support and he has earned the respect and endorsement of our clients with his constant focus on their needs. \u201cHe has played a central role in many of WPP\u2019s most successful investments and initiatives, and he has deep experience at board and operational level. In short, he is in every way a 21st-century chief executive.\u201d WPP said Read\u2019s contract contains \u201crestrictive covenants including an industry non-compete, a non-deal with clients and a non-poach and non-employ of key WPP individuals\u201d. The company was criticised for not having a non-compete clause with Sorrell. Within weeks of resigning from WPP, Sorrell had set up a new company, S4 Capital, and swooped on a \u00a3266m deal for MediaMonks, a company his former employer had also been looking at acquiring. Read has negotiated a remuneration package that will pay up to a maximum of \u00a37m annually if he is able to successfully turn around WPP\u2019s fortunes, as revealed by the Guardian. The deal is about half the \u00a313.9m that Sorrell was paid for his final full year at WPP. Read is to be paid an annual salary of \u00a3975,000 \u2013 Sorrell received \u00a31.15m \u2013 with an annual bonus of up to 2.5 times his basic salary and a long-term incentive scheme award of up to 3.5 times his salary. He is also receiving an annual cash allowance of 20% of his salary in lieu of pension and a \u00a335,000 benefits allowance. The incentive scheme will not start vesting for five years, meaning for the next few years Read\u2019s maximum remuneration will be more like \u00a33.5m. WPP has been struggling and last year reported its worst financial performance in almost a decade but Read said the global holding company model was not broken. Read said he will not consider a wholesale \u00a322bn break-up of WPP, as critics have called for, but he will look at the sale of selective assets. WPP has stakes in companies including Vice and is also looking at strategic options including a \u00a33.5bn sale, or partial sale, of its research arm Kantar. \u201cWe are focused on creating value for shareholders and there are no sacred cows,\u201d Read said. \u201cTo encapsulate [my] strategy I\u2019ve used the words \u2018radical evolution\u2019. We need to move quickly, at pace \u2013 WPP needs to come closer together, not further apart. There are many good things about the business. It is a question of simplifying the offer, refocusing the portfolio and investing more in data and technology alongside creativity.\u201d Andrew Scott, who has been running WPP jointly on an interim basis alongside Read, has agreed to continue in the role of chief operating officer. WPP will report its half-year results on Tuesday.",

      "bodyText": "The housebuilder Berkeley Group\u2019s founder and chairman, Tony Pidgley, has earned \u00a3174m over the past decade, and is set to be paid another \u00a348m by the company over the next five years, which will make him one of the highest paid bosses of a public company in Britain. His pay package has attracted the anger of politicians and housing campaigners as an investigation by the Guardian and Finance Uncovered reveals that the company has reduced its affordable housing obligations in the overwhelming majority of its London developments. While for years Berkeley has successfully persuaded planning authorities that it could not make a profit from its developments if it met affordable housing targets, it has raked in \u00a32.9bn of profit over the past seven years. Berkeley\u2019s shares have soared on the back of the profits, creating a fortune for the company\u2019s senior executives, who since 2008 have been given shares worth \u00a3610m. Pidgley himself holds an additional 4.4m shares, worth \u00a3163m. The shares have more than trebled in value over the past decade. Although the company has restricted future bonus payouts following shareholder anger, the top six executives could still collect another \u00a3127m over the next four years. Pidgley, who has amassed a \u00a3310m fortune according to the Sunday Times rich list, is set for up to \u00a348m. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, said Pidgley and other housebuilders have a duty to the nation to build more affordable housing especially if they are personally making \u201cvast fortunes\u201d from building expensive homes. \u201cTony Pidgley is rightly regarded as a sage of the housebuilding industry, with an impressive record of calling the housing market correctly. That explains why he is well-paid,\u201d Cable said. \u201cBut housebuilders who are making these vast fortunes must also understand that they have a social responsibility to make sure the country has the homes we so desperately need. Shareholders must make sure that executives are not rewarded for a poor record on affordable housing, because that does not encourage them to do the right thing and make sure we have a sustainable housing market.\u201d Some of Berkeley\u2019s biggest investors are expected to raise concerns about the vast pay packages at the company\u2019s annual meeting next week. Excluding developments where planning consents were gained by a previous owner and the student accommodation projects, in 93% of Berkeley\u2019s 57 London developments the company told local authorities that their affordable housing targets were unviable. In one example, Land Registry data indicates Berkeley Group sold 71 homes in its Ebury Square development in Belgravia, central London, for a total of \u00a3358m. The company told Westminster council that as the development was refurbishing an existing building that contained 60 units, only 11 additional homes would be generated. This meant, under Westminster planning rules, that Berkeley was obliged to build only one affordable home. But instead of building it on site, Berkeley made a payment to the council of \u00a31.6m towards low-cost housing elsewhere in the borough. Freedom of information disclosures show that Berkeley bought the Ebury Square site \u2013 a former police section house \u2013 from the Metropolitan Police for \u00a323.6m in 2009. The profit on this single development is thought to be in excess of \u00a3200m. At Kew Bridge in west London, Hounslow council accepted that Berkeley could only build 20% of a 308-unit scheme as affordable \u2013 half the local authority\u2019s affordable target. Building those units, Berkeley stated in a planning agreement, would mean the scheme would be \u00a324.6m in deficit. Berkeley told Hounslow that house sales would generate \u00a3132m. Berkeley did agree to make an extra payment to Hounslow capped at \u00a38.3m in the event of the scheme performing well. Land Registry data suggest that the scheme generated close to \u00a3250m, with one apartment selling for \u00a34.55m. A spokesman for the company said: \u201cBerkeley has a sustainable, successful business model that enables it to perform well throughout the economic cycle, as demonstrated by its results of recent years and creation of fantastic new communities and long term value. We are justly proud of our track record in building 10% of London\u2019s much-needed private and affordable homes. \u201cLast year alone, Berkeley contributed more than \u00a3400m of subsidy for affordable housing and wider community and infrastructure projects, which has helped us be recognised as London and the south-east\u2019s leading place-maker. Sales utilising Help to Buy are a very small part of Berkeley\u2019s sales.\u201d The company\u2019s remuneration policy was approved by 97% of shareholders on its introduction in February 2017, and includes caps that reduce potential awards to key executives by 50%. Berkeley\u2019s profits mark it out as the most successful builder in a sector that has reaped huge rewards in recent years. The Guardian\u2019s research shows the top nine quoted builders collectively have amassed \u00a316.9bn in pre-tax profits since 2010. Just last year, nine of Britain\u2019s biggest builders\u2019 profits topped \u00a34.56bn. Greg Beales, director of campaigns at the housing charity Shelter, said: \u201cWe\u2019re in the grip of a worsening housing crisis, so it\u2019s vital that developers build their fair share of affordable homes rather than making up endless excuses while turning over huge profits. \u201cThankfully, the government\u2019s recent changes to planning rules have made it harder for housebuilders to wriggle out of their obligations. If they\u2019re enforced properly by councils, these reforms should increase the number of affordable homes that get built. So we\u2019ll be watching closely to make sure developers are held to account.\u201d Affordable housing targets set by councils are based on local demand and supply, the costs of housing locally and local wages. The targets are usually expressed as a percentage of new housing supply. The targets are not legally binding, and if a developer can demonstrate through a site-specific financial viability test that the target makes a development uneconomic, then the requirement can be reduced or waived. The test allows for a developer to make a gross profit margin of 20%. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 September 2018. An earlier version described the Ebury Square site as a former police house. This has been corrected to say the site was a former police section house.",
