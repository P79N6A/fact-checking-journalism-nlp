      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail business has told suppliers that Arcadia Group is imposing a discount on all current and existing orders from next month. The group\u2019s CEO Ian Grabiner, blaming changes in the retail market, told suppliers that it would pay 2% less on both existing and future orders from 1 February, saving the company millions. Arcadia, which includes high street brands like Burton, Miss Selfridge, Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, told suppliers in a letter: \u201cI know this is not news that you would wish to hear, but we have absorbed significant costs in technology, distribution and people as I have earlier in order to remain competitive in the global market and we trust you will continue to support us.\u201d The cost-cutting move follows poor sales across Green\u2019s retail empire, which saw profits slump 79% in 2016 in the wake of the BHS collapse and subsequent pension scandal. Pre-tax profits fell to \u00a336.8m, compared with \u00a3172.2m in the previous year. The fashion mogul is said to have appointed management consultants McKinsey to help turn Arcadia\u2019s fortunes round, with a particular focus on internet sales. \u201cWe recently asked our suppliers for a small increase in our discount terms. The cost of servicing and delivering to our customers through new channels is considerably higher than through the traditional retail market place,\u201d Arcadia said in a statement. \u201cThis has resulted in major investment in our infrastructure in terms of systems and distribution as well as a large headcount increase. These substantial developments to our business will mutually benefit our suppliers.\u201d A source close to the company told the Guardian it had asked suppliers for discounts as it faced heavy competition from online players as well as the rising cost of distributing its clothes, running stores and selling online. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough, competitive market and the costs of doing business have escalated dramatically,\u201d the source said, adding that Arcadia was known for having reasonable terms compared with some rivals. \u201cWe don\u2019t think this is draconian.\u201d Citing rising pressure from online rivals like boohoo, Missguided and Asos, the company source suggested that Arcadia brands have been trading poorly due to online competition. The fashion industry has had a tough season after a warm autumn enabled shoppers to put off buying coats and knitwear, while business rates, the minimum wage and other costs have risen. Fashion has also slipped down shoppers\u2019 lists as they spend more on eating out, going on holiday, using their phones and other experiences. Shoppers also have less money to spend because inflation is outstripping wage rises. New Look, Debenhams and Marks &amp; Spencer are all expected to close stores, and John Lewis has been cutting staff as they try to adapt to changing shopping habits. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Income inequality is not normally an issue that arises much thought during the Australian Open, but this week inequality, as it is in much of the rest of society, has reared its head in tennis, and with it has come talk also of the need for a stronger unionisation of workers. It is easy to scoff when talk arose this week that Novak Djokovic had reportedly called for a formation of a new players union that would split from the ATP \u2013 an organisation that both represents the players and also organises the tournaments \u2013 in order to get the players a greater share of the tournament revenue. More money? This from a man with career earnings above US$110m while playing at a tournament where the loser in the first round earns A$60,000. But such numbers hide the real story of professional tennis. The sport is built on hundreds of players winning bugger all, and leaving the sport due to costs and an inability to actually earn a living. Professional tennis, like all professions, is made up of workers who are mostly unobserved by the broader public. Rather than Melbourne Park centre court, most players find themselves in places such as glamorous Elizabeth playing in the \u201cCity of Playford Tennis International\u201d which, if they win will earn them $10,800. Lose in the first round \u2013 as half the field always does in a tennis tournament \u2013 and the cheque is for $780. While the money in tennis is great for those at the top, the drop off is stark and very much so compared to other high profile individual sports. Running around some tennis court being watched by no one except a few local members is not the usual image of professional tennis, but it is the foundation of the tour. All players come through the Futures and Challenger circuits before getting their ranking high enough to get entry into the qualifying draw of an ATP tour event. But doing so costs a lot of money. In truth, it is a hell of a life. Why anyone does it is beyond me. Barely more than 200 men a year earn more than the average Australian full-time earnings, and yet without those masses of players living out of a suitcase and playing in small tournaments around the world, the ATP tour would atrophy. And the drop off in earnings for players is stark \u2013 especially when you compare it to another individual sport like golf: One hundred and thirty men on the USPGA tour earned more than did the 50th best players on the ATP tour in 2017. In 2017, 42 men on the ATP tour earned over US$1m, compared to 102 on the USPGA. And that is not including the European golf tour, which had 40 players earn over $1m. On the PGA tour in 2017, the 150th highest money earner Michael Thompson, earned US$568,991, by contrast the 150th highest earner on the ATP tour last year was German Yannick Hanfmann \u2013 he took home US$144,674. Now, yes, that still is a lot of money \u2013 more than double the average male full-time earnings in Australia. But whereas Thompson won his money travelling around the USA, Hanfmann spent his time in 2017 playing in 16 different countries \u2013 from his home of Germany to the USA, Japan, China, Mexico, Kazakstan and Panama. Travelling to Panama is a long way to go to earn US$860. It\u2019s enough to make you think you should dream of your future child becoming a golfer rather than a tennis player. But not so fast ... first you best not assume your child will be a boy. If she is a girl, tennis is the way to go. Female tennis players consistently earn more than their golfing peers In 2017, the 100th best female tennis player last year took home US$368,628 \u2013 helped by playing a mixture of singles and doubles \u2013 compared to US$98,261 earned by the 100th best golfer on the US LPGA tour. Respectable sure, but not so much that your dreams of retiring off your child\u2019s earnings are going to come true. Indeed the parity of earnings for men and women in tennis is quite clear \u2013 only Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal really stand out as earning greatly more than their equivalent ranked women in 2017 (of course we\u2019re not counting sponsorships) In golf however, the best men earn astronomically more than their female peers: Forty-one men on the PGA tour earned more than the top earner on the LPGA, compared to only three men on the ATP tour earning more than Venus Williams in 2017. There is not much that can be done to change this. Men and women have always played at grand slams concurrently, in a way that is not possible for a golf tournament. And it is not really an issue unless you are a male player who thinks he deserves more than a woman. I\u2019ve never been a big fan of the \u201cmen play best of five, they should get paid more\u201d argument. The reality is if you took women out of the tournament, the grand slams would quickly lose any lustre. The reason people who don\u2019t normally care about tennis tune in for these two weeks is the importance of the event \u2013 and that event is important because both men and women are there. It\u2019s similar to how athletics is always the biggest event in the Olympics, but if you took away the other smaller events you would just have an athletics world championships which most people give barely a stuff about. The case for tennis players earning more money is well worth considering. But as with all cases of income, the issue really isn\u2019t the top earners, but inequality. And while tennis has done very well with inequality across genders, the disparity between the top and the poorest remains massive. And for that, joining a union is a very smart step.

      "bodyText": "A parliamentary inquiry into food standards at 2 Sisters Food Group took a bizarre turn on Wednesday when a select committee accused the chicken processor of an \u201cattempt to impugn\u201d its impartiality by sending MPs \u201cunsolicited\u201d biscuits. Writing to the group\u2019s chief executive Ranjit Singh Boparan, MP Neil Parish, the Conservative chair of the environment, food and rural affairs committee, said: \u201cSeveral members of my committee have reported the receipt of unsolicited gifts from the 2 Sisters Food Group over the Christmas period. \u201cWe consider the sending of these gifts to be an inappropriate gesture on your part and an unwarranted attempt to impugn the committee\u2019s impartiality.

The multi-millionaire entrepreneur had appeared in front of the committee in October following a Guardian and ITV undercover investigation into food standards at the firm\u2019s West Bromwich plant, which included footage showing chickens being retrieved from the factory floor and placed back on to the production line. During the parliamentary hearing, Boparan apologised for the scandal that had engulfed his company and prompted the firm to suspend production from the West Bromwich site for five weeks. The committee said it planned to call further witnesses to give evidence this year. Parish added that the biscuits had been donated to charity or returned to 2 Sisters. \u201cThose members in receipt of gifts from 2 Sisters Food Group have declared this in the committee\u2019s formal minutes,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Efforts by the government to reassure thousands of staff employed by Carillion to work for private sector clients were called \u201cflimsy\u201d, as the small businesses owed money by the failed company braced for losses. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said most of the companies that were using Carillion\u2019s 8,500-strong private sector workforce have agreed to provide funding to continue paying them. But trade unions warned the promise would not provide sufficient reassurance and voiced fears that Carillion\u2019s financial failure would spread further among suppliers, some of which have begun laying off staff. As the government grappled with the fallout from Carillion\u2019s collapse: Banks and HM Revenue &amp; Customs vowed to assist affected firms. Carillion\u2019s former boss quit a \u00a360,000-a-year job at another company. Directors\u2019 bonuses and salaries were stopped. Government monitoring of Carillion was criticised. The Insolvency Service, which is sifting through Carillion\u2019s contracts in an effort to limit disruption, said 90% of firms contacted have agreed to \u201cprovide funding\u201d to ensure the services such as cleaning and maintenance continue. \u201cOver the past 48 hours all of the company\u2019s private sector service customers have been contacted to determine their ongoing needs,\u201d the Insolvency Service said. \u201cThe Official Receiver is very pleased with the level of support shown by Carillion\u2019s private sector service customers. Work has paused on construction sites, pending decisions as to how and if they will be restarted.\u201d Some 10% of Carillion\u2019s list of private sector customers, which include Nationwide and National Grid, have yet to make such a commitment. The GMB trade union said the statement from the Insolvency Service \u201craises more questions than it answers\u201d. \u201cEnsuring most workers get paid beyond today doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough to give the reassurance our members need right now,\u201d said general secretary Tim Roache. \u201cWe need proper guarantees that they will not be left in the lurch and unable to pay the bills within days due to a crisis they did not cause. Without assurances as to how long wages are secure for and who will be running these contracts given the company\u2019s spectacular failure, this is not going to help Carillion workers sleep easier tonight.\u201d Britain\u2019s biggest trade union Unite warned that thousands of staff at Carillion\u2019s estimated 30,000 supplier and subcontractor companies were also at risk. Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said: \u201cThe government has a moral duty to provide direct financial assistance as well as other support in order to ensure that subcontractors and suppliers don\u2019t needlessly go to the wall, with thousands of workers potentially losing their jobs.\u201d Business secretary Greg Clarkmet banks on Wednesday morning, asking them to provide additional financial support. \u201cSMEs are not responsible for the collapse of Carillion and banks should bear that in mind,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. HMRC and the banking industry both promised extra time to make tax and loan repayments. UK Finance, the trade body that represents banks, said the industry was ready to offer \u201cemergency measures\u201d. HMRC offered affected companies the chance to pay by instalment, defer payment, and avoid penalties for missing tax deadlines. As the prime minister fielded questions in parliament about the crisis, the government faced criticism over its dealings with Carillion. Court documents filed as part of the firm\u2019s liquidation show many of its customers were abandoning the company even as the government continued to award it contracts. Wolverhampton-based Carillion began weekly reporting on its financial position to government from the autumn, several months after its July profits warning. A witness statement from interim chief executive Keith Cochrane said the company subsequently won \u201csignificant new contracts, including with [the government] at a time when certain long-standing customers informed the company that they would not place new work until its balance sheet issues were resolved\u201d. Carillion announced the award of eight public sector contracts after the July warning, including joint venture arrangements to build parts of the HS2 line. Transport secretary Chris Grayling told ITV there was \u201cno legal basis for excluding a consortium of companies that have done nothing wrong\u201d and that due diligence had been carried out. But Jon Trickett, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, accused ministers of ignoring warning signs: \u201cMany other businesses, including longstanding customers stopped supporting Carillion because of the state of its finances. \u201cYet the government continued to hand them major contracts whilst failing to monitor them properly until it was too late.\u201d The Cabinet Office has pointed to the fact that many of these contracts were joint ventures with partner firms who could step in to pick up the work. The document also shows that Carillion hoped \u201cthat HMG would provide support to the company to mitigate and help managed the challenges it faced\u201d. But the end came a week after Carillion asked ministers for a bailout on 8 January of about \u00a320m. Ministers refused the request at a meeting on Sunday, forcing it to enter liquidation the following day. The Cabinet Office said directors who were in charge when Carillion collapsed are no longer receiving salaries or bonuses, including severance payments due to executives who have left. The government has asked the Insolvency Service to fast-track an investigation into the conduct of the directors. Former chief executive Richard Howson, who quit in July after the firm first revealed it was in financial difficulty, has stepped down from a \u00a360,000-a-year job with oil services company John Wood Group. Shadow work and pension secretary Debbie Abrahams said she had written to her opposite number, Esther McVey, to ask for more detail on plans to deal with Carillion\u2019s retirement scheme, which has a \u00a3590m deficit. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 January 2018 to remove a suggestion that British Gas was in the 10% of Carillion\u2019s private sector customers which had yet to make a commitment to the Insolvency Administrator.",

    "webTitle": "GKN should be no pushover as Melrose bid turns hostile | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "You cannot blame Melrose Industries for firing off its \u00a37bn hostile offer for GKN, the UK\u2019s last big automotive and aerospace combo, after less than a week of informal exchanges. The bidder has had the better of the warm-up action, so best to kick off early. Melrose\u2019s shares had floated upwards, generating momentum behind a 430p a share offer where only 81p is in actual cash. But look at how the target\u2019s shares have been electrified. GKN investors, if they wish, can now sell in the market at an all-time high of 448p, versus 320p at the start of the year. Meanwhile, since any equity-heavy offer is really about who gets to manage the assets, the chat has concentrated on the boardroom lineups. Melrose holds aces. A single pound invested when the company was formed in 2003 as a sort of regathering of the 1990s Hanson clan is now worth \u00a317.70. The Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, may regard Melrose as an ugly crew of financial engineers, but it is not the City\u2019s view. In any case, Cable should save his grumbles in case even more hard-nosed operators \u2013 think private equity \u2013 try to gatecrash proceedings. Melrose buys and sells companies, but the numbers show it also invests in them. And the GKN record? Mixed, at best. A strong recovery from 2009 to 2014 has ground to a halt. GKN itself concedes it needs to improve its profit margins and will unveil its \u201cProject Boost\u201d shortly. But it is starting with the serious disadvantage of a botched succession. The former non-executive Anne Stevens, an former Ford veteran, has been installed as boss but is plainly too new to have a Melrose-style fan club. So is it obvious that Melrose will win? It is favourite but, no, this is not a done deal. GKN\u2019s pensions trustees are the other player, as they should be given that the deficit is \u00a31.1bn on one accounting basis. The trustees are within their rights to demand a big one-off contribution as the price of agreeing a change of control. Melrose, with a business worth \u00a34bn, can plead that it arrives with a clean pension position, but nothing talks like upfront cash. A demand of \u00a3400m for the pension pot, as some analysts speculate, could change the arithmetic. Then there is the vague sense that Melrose\u2019s clever chaps are being too cute with their mostly shares offer. GKN may have been under-managed, but it plainly has excellent assets \u2013 it supplies Boeing, Airbus and most of the world\u2019s big car manufacturers. If a credible self-help plan can be presented, there should, in theory, be no need for shareholders to turn to an emergency corporate doctor. Owning 100% of a better managed GKN ought to be better than diluting the rewards. The trick is to stop chasing sales and concentrate on profit margins, which is roughly what Melrose recommends. Stevens will have to play a blinder: her personal credibility will be critical to the outcome. But GKN investors should start with an open mind. Melrose\u2019s first offer is clearly not its best offer. And GKN\u2019s next strategic plan can\u2019t be worse than its last one. Carillion inflicts pain on masochist Morgan Ministers are getting flak for being slow to spot the crisis at Carillion, but let\u2019s not overlook the Labour peer Sally Morgan. She joined Carillion\u2019s board as a non-executive director on 1 July last year, at which point the hedge funds were in full riot. Some 25% of the stock was out on loan, a rare sight in the stock market, especially at a company that (at the time) was still valued at more than \u00a31bn. For anybody sitting on an offer of a non-executive job, the hedge funds action was surely a cue to do a double round of homework, make more calls and worry that becoming a director of Carillion might not be a career-enhancing move. Morgan, one supposes, still had good civil service contacts to tap for advice from her time as Tony Blair\u2019s political secretary. And she definitely had an extra reason to be cautious. One of her former non-executive adventures came at the ill-fated Southern Cross Healthcare \u2013 she was on the board from flotation in 2006 to corporate demise in 2011. When Carillion issued its monstrous profits warnings 10 days after Morgan\u2019s arrival, she then agreed to become the senior independent director with a place on all the main committees \u2013 audit, remuneration, nomination and business integrity. Her reward for that selfless act of masochism, one assumes, will be a walk-on role at the inevitable select committee inquiry \u2013 not a great return on six months\u2019 worth of non-exec fees.

      "body": "<p>You cannot blame Melrose Industries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/17/gkn-rejects-74bn-hostile-takeover-bid-melrose\">for firing off its \u00a37bn hostile offer for GKN</a>, the UK\u2019s last big automotive and aerospace combo, after less than a week of informal exchanges. The bidder has had the better of the warm-up action, so best to kick off early.</p> <p>Melrose\u2019s shares had floated upwards, generating momentum behind a 430p a share offer where only 81p is in actual cash. But look at how the target\u2019s shares have been electrified. GKN investors, if they wish, can now sell in the market at an all-time high of 448p, versus 320p at the start of the year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, since any equity-heavy offer is really about who gets to manage the assets, the chat has concentrated on the boardroom lineups. Melrose holds aces. A single pound invested when the company was formed in 2003 as a sort of regathering of the 1990s Hanson clan is now worth \u00a317.70.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, may regard Melrose as an ugly crew of financial engineers, but it is not the City\u2019s view. In any case, Cable should save his grumbles in case even more hard-nosed operators \u2013 think private equity \u2013 try to gatecrash proceedings. Melrose buys and sells companies, but the numbers show it also invests in them.</p> <p>And the GKN record? Mixed, at best. A strong recovery from 2009 to 2014 has ground to a halt. GKN itself concedes it needs to improve its profit margins and will unveil its \u201cProject Boost\u201d shortly. But it is starting with the serious disadvantage of a botched succession. The former non-executive Anne Stevens, an former Ford veteran, has been installed as boss but is plainly too new to have a Melrose-style fan club.</p> <p>So is it obvious that Melrose will win? It is favourite but, no, this is not a done deal. GKN\u2019s pensions trustees are the other player, as they should be given that the deficit is \u00a31.1bn on one accounting basis. The trustees are within their rights to demand a big one-off contribution as the price of agreeing a change of control. Melrose, with a business worth \u00a34bn, can plead that it arrives with a clean pension position, but nothing talks like upfront cash. A demand of \u00a3400m for the pension pot, as some analysts speculate, could change the arithmetic.</p> <p>Then there is the vague sense that Melrose\u2019s clever chaps are being too cute with their mostly shares offer. GKN may have been under-managed, but it plainly has excellent assets \u2013 it supplies Boeing, Airbus and most of the world\u2019s big car manufacturers. If a credible self-help plan can be presented, there should, in theory, be no need for shareholders to turn to an emergency corporate doctor. Owning 100% of a better managed GKN ought to be better than diluting the rewards. The trick is to stop chasing sales and concentrate on profit margins, which is roughly what Melrose recommends.</p> <p>Stevens will have to play a blinder: her personal credibility will be critical to the outcome. But GKN investors should start with an open mind. Melrose\u2019s first offer is clearly not its best offer. And GKN\u2019s next strategic plan can\u2019t be worse than its last one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e96c5029d71446714958c50425cac594efeb15cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e96c5029d71446714958c50425cac594efeb15cd/249_719_4173_2503/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pedestrian walks past a Carillion construction site\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man walks past a Carillion construction site.

      "bodyText": "Andrew Adonis is right to see Carillion as another Lehman (Report, 17 January). In the same way as letting Lehman fail undermined the whole banking sector, the failure of Carillion will infect the whole supply chain and threaten all companies that have the same flawed model of using high levels of debt to give the illusion of profitability. Like the banks, some form of state rescue will be needed. However, the state should not repeat the error of using public money to put Humpty Dumpty back on the wall. As Aditya Chakrabortty says (It\u2019s time to take on the zombies, 17 January), the nonsense of neoliberalism must be challenged. Stratospheric executive pay, prioritising shareholder value and stock market froth do not reflect market efficiency. Nor are states households that must be disciplined by austerity. As I argue in my book Debt or Democracy, public money is an independent force, as the bank rescue showed. The private sector needs a vibrant public economy able to use all its powers to sustain overall economic wellbeing (wellth). The private sector is only as strong as its weakest link. When that fails, the only grownup in the room is the public economy. In the face of market failure, states need to plug the gap with surplus expenditure, that is, deficit spending, funded by quantitative easing not borrowing. When the crisis is over, if necessary, this spending can be reclaimed through taxation. Mary Mellor Newcastle upon Tyne \u2022 Your practical suggestions regarding a proper response to the Carillion debacle (Editorial, 16 January) are rather feeble. It is clear that Carillion was overindebted and that will doubtless be true of many other British companies, because the tax system encourages companies to use debt finance rather than equity finance, as debt interest is allowable against profit. This is bound to put companies seriously at risk of insolvency when their cashflow is reduced, so it is not a policy consistent with good macroeconomic management. The solution is clear: disallow debt interest as a charge against profits. This should be done \u2013 in phases, if necessary \u2013 only for large companies, leaving small and medium companies still able to charge debt interest against profits as now. The result would be threefold. First, large companies would be more financially stable. Second \u2013 other things being equal \u2013 they would pay more corporation tax. Third, SMEs would have a competitive advantage, and so a better chance of winning government contracts, which would serve the public interest better. This is one of a number of practical policy changes that need to be made to force large companies to better serve the public good, including measures to combat tax avoidance and evasion advocated by the Tax Justice Network. Ian Lovegrove Manchester \u2022 Carillion\u2019s role in exacerbating the current prison crisis should be highlighted. Independent Monitoring Boards at Dartmoor and Ford have pointed to serious weaknesses in its service delivery. In late 2017 the prison inspectorate indicated that in Wormwood Scrubs \u201cmany repairs were outstanding, often for many months. Numerous cell windows were broken, affecting security \u2026 Many showers and telephones were out of action, which caused considerable frustration to prisoners, who often had only limited time on association to wash and make calls \u2026 These delays were caused by the maintenance services team, managed by Carillion, not being fully staffed, and also by difficulties with prison staff reporting repair jobs and allowing access to cells \u2026 The prison\u2019s main stores were locked up during the inspection and were not currently staffed by Carillion, the remaining employees having left many weeks before. They had to be accessed on an ad hoc basis by prison managers, who left already-overstretched residential units to fetch essential daily items, which meant that supply was haphazard. Most cells had televisions and kettles, and some store rooms had been replenished before the inspection, but there was no reliable, weekly flow of these items to the wings \u2026 In our survey, only 31% of respondents said that they normally got clean sheets.\u201d This is a shocking indictment not only of Carillion but also of the corrosive, immoral policies uncritically pursued by successive governments in facilitating private sector involvement in the criminal justice system. Is it any wonder that prisoners are frustrated and that the prison system is in severe crisis? Professor Joe Sim School of humanities and social science, Liverpool John Moores University \u2022 The government says that it awarded contracts to Carillion after the company\u2019s profit warning in order to avoid pushing Carillion under. But, when awarding public contracts, purchasing authorities define the qualification criteria \u2013 including financial reliability criteria \u2013 that firms must meet to be allowed to bid. It would be an extraordinary failure if these did not exclude the possibility of bids being accepted from a company in serious financial difficulties. More troubling, if the criteria were in fact sufficient to prevent that outcome, and if what the government now says is true, its conduct would be unlawful. Purchasing authorities cannot waive financial reliability criteria for a particular company, no matter how important, since that would destroy the level playing field to which other bidders are entitled. It would expose the government to litigation by disappointed bidders. This was, after all, the fate, only a few years ago, of the then corporate officer of the House of Commons in a case concerning a contract for the supply of windows for parliament\u2019s Portcullis House, a case which cost taxpayers more than \u00a35m in damages and over \u00a34m in costs. Let\u2019s hope, as the government tries to explain its awards to Carillion, that it doesn\u2019t sleep walk into an even more expensive round of litigation. Peter Kunzlik Emeritus professor of law, University of East Anglia \u2022 The collapse of Carillion raises yet more questions for Whittington Health\u2019s new contract with a private provider. Its board has just appointed Ryhurst, a subsidiary of Rydon, the Grenfell refurbishment contractor, to manage and initially provide the capital to develop the Whittington estates strategy. Whittington Health provides general hospital and community services to 500,000 people living in Islington and Haringey, as well as other London boroughs. Though it\u2019s pressing hospitals to develop, the government will not provide funding, so forcing hospitals into private finance. But why Ryhurst? The Whittington board won\u2019t give reasons why Ryhurst\u2019s bid was accepted over the others. All it and the CEO say is that there was an open procurement process which Ryhurst won. But that depends on what was in the contract specification, which also seems not to be available to public scrutiny. We can only assume that the lowest price was the winning factor. Just like Carillion, which has collapsed because they\u2019ve taken underfunded contracts, which they couldn\u2019t afford (or the profit margins weren\u2019t big enough). So now thousands of jobs will go, pensions are under threat and communities will decline. The Defend the Whittington Hospital Coalition (DWHC) is campaigning to get Rydon out of the Whittington. We wish the workers solidarity over their jobs and pensions. Dr Valerie Lipman London \u2022 The British Woodworking Federation represents the UK\u2019s \u00a33.8bn woodworking sector, a craft at the heart of the UK\u2019s construction sector, which employs approximately 60,000 people around the country. As the news of the liquidation of Carillion breaks, it is almost ironic that we are putting our final comments in on the government\u2019s consultation into retention payments in the construction industry. This debate is not about whether the state should bail out Carillion, but whether government can in all conscience turn its back on a supply chain of SMEs who will end up carrying the can for poor procurement, bad business management and an endemic failure by the government to address some of the archaic procurement practices surrounding late payments and retentions that place risk unfairly on SME subcontractors. Many of the creditors are SMEs and the sums, while likely to be significantly lower than the liquidators will take, could define the future of these businesses \u2013 it would be a gross injustice if their money unfairly held is lost in this process. To my mind the government is complicit in the sorry saga that is unfolding, and we need decisions fast. In the short term we need to see some security against these retentions and unjust payment clauses. Moving forward, we urge the government to develop a structured and more consistent legislative process to deal with market failures, be they banks, construction firms or steel manufacturers. We cannot rely on arbitrary decision-making and political posturing. There needs to be clear process to ensure those responsible foot the bill and ensure society and supply chains do not suffer unduly. The government consistently fails to recognise the stress of running a small business and keeping people employed \u2013 a lot of business owners in this supply chain won\u2019t be sleeping soundly until this is resolved.

The Defend the Whittington Hospital Coalition (DWHC) is campaigning to get Rydon out of the Whittington.</p> <p>We wish the workers solidarity over their jobs and pensions.<br><strong>Dr Valerie Lipman</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The British Woodworking Federation represents the UK\u2019s \u00a33.8bn woodworking sector, a craft at the heart of the UK\u2019s construction sector, which employs approximately 60,000 people around the country.</p> <p>As the news of the liquidation of Carillion breaks, it is almost ironic that we are putting our final comments in on the government\u2019s consultation into retention payments in the construction industry. This debate is not about whether the state should bail out Carillion, but whether government can in all conscience turn its back on a supply chain of SMEs who will end up carrying the can for poor procurement, bad business management and an endemic failure by the government to address some of the archaic procurement practices surrounding late payments and retentions that place risk unfairly on SME subcontractors. Many of the creditors are SMEs and the sums, while likely to be significantly lower than the liquidators will take, could define the future of these businesses \u2013 it would be a gross injustice if their money unfairly held is lost in this process.</p> <p>To my mind the government is complicit in the sorry saga that is unfolding, and we need decisions fast. In the short term we need to see some security against these retentions and unjust payment clauses. Moving forward, we urge the government to develop a structured and more consistent legislative process to deal with market failures, be they banks, construction firms or steel manufacturers. We cannot rely on arbitrary decision-making and political posturing. There needs to be clear process to ensure those responsible foot the bill and ensure society and supply chains do not suffer unduly. The government consistently fails to recognise the stress of running a small business and keeping people employed \u2013 a lot of business owners in this supply chain won\u2019t be sleeping soundly until this is resolved.<br><strong>Ian McIlwee</strong><br><em>CEO, British Woodworking Federation</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p>",

The UK\u2019s largest retailer said on Wednesday it had listened to the feedback and would postpone the introduction of the changes until 10 June. Tesco wrote to its millions of Clubcard customers this week to say it had \u201csimplified\u201d the scheme, with the changes taking effect from 15 January, to make it more straightforward.

    "webTitle": "Carillion crisis: Most private customers to keep paying staff; director bonuses stopped - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Another day of developments following Carillion\u2019s shock collapse on Monday. Good news for many of the company\u2019s employees. The Insolvency Service said that 90% of the companies who employed Carillion have decided that they want those services to continue, and pledged to keep paying for them. An estimated 8,500 people of Carillion\u2019s UK workforce were employed on private sector work and faced the risk of being laid off, since the government is not guaranteeing to pay their wages. But almost 10% of those companies have not joined the agreement, making it an uncertain time for staff on those contracts. Meanwhile bonuses and severance payments to former Carillion executives have been stopped, as of the date of the liquidation. And there was good news for small firms hit by Carillion\u2019s collapse. Banks have agreed emergency measures to help them keep trading and do not face a cash crunch if they are owed money by Carillion which they are unlikely to get. Unsurprisingly, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn clashed over Carillion at prime minister\u2019s question time. Meanwhile shares in outsourcer Interserve fell sharply after a report the Cabinet Office was keeping a close eye on the company. But they recovered after the Cabinet Office said it did not believe any of its suppliers were in a similar position to Carillion. The company also maintained its financial position was improving. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Speaking of companies picking up Carillion\u2019s contracts, analysts at Jefferies have been taking a look at the possible candidates. Here is their note: MITIE 5% probability-weighted revenue upside. In our view, MITIE has the widest array of opportunities as it offers similar services to Carillion and has a considerably lower market share in public sector than private. Facilities management contracts at Heathrow Airport (where MITIE has provided services since 2010), Centrica (MITIE\u2019s new CEO is ex-Centrica), Mapeley HMRC, Nationwide and Prisons FM all offer upside. Although balance sheet uncertainty and the FCA investigation into the timing of the September profit warning under previous management could count against it, the recent \u00a3525m Home Office immigration detainees escort contract suggests otherwise. Serco 3% probability-weighted revenue upside, but 7-8% EPS impact due to current low margins. In December 2017, Serco signed a Business Purchase Agreement to acquire a portfolio of selected UK health facilities management contracts from Carillion for \u00a347.7m. Carillion is now in breach of the BPA so Serco could walk away, renegotiate, or deal directly with the individual special purpose vehicle operating contract holders. In our view, management remains committed to completing the transaction, may accelerate transition from the original schedule, and seek dialogue with Carillion\u2019s remaining healthcare contracts (up to \u00a360m additional revenue). Elsewhere, Prisons FM, Hestia and Allenby/Connaught may also offer upside. Babcock 2% probability-weighted revenue upside. In our view, Babcock could generate additional revenue from two areas: 1) Almost ten years ago, Network Rail transferred business to Babcock after the demise of Jarvis and \u00a330-40m of Carillion\u2019s track renewal and electrification business could follow a similar path; 2) The Next Generation Estate Contracts as Babcock previously operated two regions and has a long-standing, deep and supportive relationship with the MoD. Although it will wish to be a supportive partner to the MoD, these contracts were loss-making and require viable economic terms. Sodexo 1% probability-weighted revenue upside. In our view, Sodexo also has a wide array of opportunities including facilities management contracts at Mapeley HMRC, Nationwide, Prisons FM, Hestia, Northwood Joint Permanent HQ, and Allenby Connaught PFI. However, the probability-weighted impact on group organic revenue growth would be a mere 1%. There are several companies which could replace Carillion on public contracts, says Fitch Ratings, but any additional costs will depend on the individual project. The ratings agency - which did not rate Carillion and says the engineering and construction sector is generally sub-investment grade - said: The implications of Carillion\u2019s collapse for the UK PFI/PPP sector will vary between projects. There are several companies that could replace Carillion on individual projects, but replacement costs on construction projects will depend on how advanced construction is, and on how much money, if any, is owed to sub-contractors. Similarly, the availability of suitably qualified replacement operators and the project\u2019s ability to absorb the potential for increased costs and delays if the operator is replaced, is an important consideration in our project ratings analysis. Fitch does not rate any PFI/PPP project that has Carillion as a contractor or service provider. The fact that the company has gone into liquidation suggests there is no value in some of its existing contracts and that they were under-priced. This implies that replacement costs will have to compensate the new contractor/operator for that under-pricing. Carillion had a number of joint ventures with other established construction companies which should be well-placed to understand replacement risk. If Fitch considers the availability of substitute operators unlikely, given the specialised nature, size, or location of a project, our rating may be capped at that of the operator. Education select committee chairman Robert Halfon wants to know what impact Carillion\u2019s collapse will have on schools and the 1,400 apprenticeships run by the company. He has written to education secretary Damian Hinds, saying: Given the scale and nature of the services provided by Carillion to almost 900 schools and colleges, it is essential that the impacts of the firm\u2019s collapse are understood and steps taken to ensure the continuity of services such as school catering and facilities management across the country. First he loses his bonus and now he loses another job. Former Carillion chief executive Richard Howson has just resigned as a non-executive director at oilfield services company John Wood Group. The government has welcomed the emergency support that banks will provide to help smallercompanies affected by Carillion\u2019s liquidation. Away from Carillion and over to Canada, where the central bank has raised interest rates from 1% to 1.25%. Economist James Knightley at ING gives the background: The Canadian economy is strong and inflation pressures are rising, hence why the BoC hiked. But fears over the future of NAFTA are causing concern. This is key for the future path for interest rates Following a raft of strong activity data and a pick-up in inflation the Bank of Canada raised the target for its overnight rate to 1.25%. This was broadly the view amongst economists and in financial markets, which had swung behind the idea of a rate rise following two consecutive bumper Canadian jobs reports and stronger inflation readings. This was reflected in the accompanying statement, which stated that \u201clabour market slack is being absorbed more quickly than anticipated\u201d. It also highlighted strong data, inflation being close to target and the belief that the \u201ceconomy is operating roughly at capacity\u201d as reasons to raise interest rates. They are expecting to see a slowdown in 2018, but have had to acknowledge that \u201cgrowth is expected to remain above potential through the first quarter of 2018\u201d. Nonetheless, there are clearly risks, most notably the potential for Donald Trump to pull the plug on NAFTA. US-Canadian trade flows total an amount equivalent to 32% of Canadian GDP so disruption would be very bad news. Uncertainty on this issue is \u201cclouding the economic outlook\u201d according to the statement, which is likely to weigh on business investment and trade in their view. Consequently, the BoC still see the need for \u201csome continued monetary policy accommodation\u201d and warn that the Governing Council will \u201cremain cautious in considering future policy adjustments\u201d. Despite this the \u201ceconomic outlook is expected to warrant higher interest rates over time\u201d. We certainly agree and see further upside to Canadian growth given the improving global backdrop and rising commodity demand. We are also encouraged by Trump\u2019s recent comments, hinting at a growing willingness to work with Mexico and Canada on a NAFTA compromise. As such we are predicting a two more 25bp hikes in the second half of 2018. Here is the Press Association story on the Carillion directors\u2019 bonuses: Bonus payments to directors and former executives at collapsed construction giant Carillion have been stopped. The move came amid political anger about bumper payments to executives who had been in charge as the firm headed for the rocks. The Insolvency Service said payments, including those included in severance packages for former executives, had been halted after the firm went into liquidation on Monday... At Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn lashed out at the \u201cwildly excessive\u201d bonuses paid to directors. Carillion\u2019s former chief executive Richard Howson pocketed \u00a31.5m in salary, bonuses and pension payments during 2016 and, as part of his departure deal, Carillion agreed to keep paying him a \u00a3660,000 salary and \u00a328,000 in benefits until October. Former finance chief Zafar Khan, who left Carillion in September, was due to receive \u00a3425,000 in base salary for 12 months. Interim chief executive Keith Cochrane was due to be paid his \u00a3750,000 salary until July, despite leaving the company in February...The Prime Minister said the Official Receiver\u2019s investigation into the firm would \u201clook into the conduct not just of current directors but also of previous directors and their actions\u201d. It was possible to take action to claw back bonuses that have already been paid, she indicated. \u201cThe Official Receiver does have the power to ensure that, in reviewing payments to executives, where those payments are unlawful or unjustified he can take action to recover those payments,\u201d the Prime Minister said. Was there a discussion about the profit warning within the department? Heaton says we were aware of the growing worrying signs from Carillion so we stepped up our contingency planning. The committee moves on to other issues. Heaton is asked about the costs to the taxpayer. He says this is unknown. We need to pay the official receiver for services , there may be additional costs, dislocation costs or costs of stabilising the services. Heaton is asked what steps and contingency plans were taken, given Carillion\u2019s profit warning in July. He says the contract was not an easy one for Carillion and the services we were getting weren\u2019t perfect so we were working very hard to manage the contracts. Plus we were doing contingency planning for this very outcome, looking at bringing it in house or getting new owners etc. Heaton said the priority was business continuity, vital services being maintained. Michael Spurr, chief executive of the prison and probation service, said Carillion staff continued to work. Talks are going on with the official receiver. Spurr says, we have staff on site and we have directly employed staff we can deploy to make sure services can continue [while discussions with the official receiver go on]. In parliament, the public accounts committee is quizzing Richard Heaton, permanent secretary at the ministry of justice, and begins by asking about the department\u2019s exposure to Carillion. Heaton says the main exposure is in the prison service. Carillion provided facilities management services for half of the public prisons, effectively all those south of Birmingham. The services are now being provided through the official receiver. Also a small number of courts had facilities management services provided by Carillion through joint ventures, and it is also involved in a very small way in the legal aid helpline. Payments to former Carillion directors have been stopped from the date of the company\u2019s liquidation, says the Cabinet Office. Minister Oliver Dowden told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One: I can confirm that any payments to directors beyond liquidation date have been stopped. So these people aren\u2019t going to be paid. The move includes severance payments. A spokesman for the Insolvency Service said: Any bonus payment to directors, beyond the liquidation date, have been stopped and this includes the severance payments which were being paid to some senior executives who left the company. Transport secretary Chris Grayling has also defended the government\u2019s decision to hand contracts to Carillion even after its profit warning, says ITV. Grayling said all work was given to consortia rather than individual companies, including the contracts for the HS2 rail link. He told ITV News: It\u2019s been clear for sometime that Carillion\u2019s had issues, many construction firms have had issues over the years. HS2 did not have a contract on this project with a single company, it contracts with consortia; the whole consortia, the whole joint venture is responsible for delivering the project. It\u2019s not for government, it\u2019s not for HS2 to exclude firms, possibly pushing them under, because of the impact on their business, arguably illegal to do so, because there\u2019s no legal reason to exclude them. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman has confirmed that 90% of Carillion\u2019s private sector clients want to keep employing its service. That means that most staff will keep being paid (at least in the short term while the Official Receiver deals with the situation). Andy Bell of Channel 5 News says its good news: The FT\u2019s Jim Pickard agrees: But Noble Francis, economics director of the Construction Products Association, argues that Carillion staff in the building industry need more help: Newsflash: Many of the Carillion staff employed on private sector contracts will continue to be paid while the company\u2019s liquidation is carried out. The Insolvency Service has announced that most (but not all) of the companies who employed Carillion have decided that they want those services to continue, and pledged to keep paying for them. That\u2019s an important development, as an estimated 8,500 people of Carillion\u2019s UK workforce were employed on private sector work. They faced the risk of being laid off today, as the government isn\u2019t guaranteeing to pay their wages. It also confirms what Theresa May told parliament in PMQs. However, almost 10% of those companies have not made such a pledge -- meaning that staff on those contracts face uncertainty, and perhaps job losses. A spokesperson for the Insolvency Service said: The Official Receiver is very pleased with the level of support shown by Carillion\u2019s private sector service customers. Over the past 48 hours all of the company\u2019s private sector service customers have been contacted to determine their ongoing needs. Over 90% of these customers have indicated that they want Carillion to continue providing services in the interim until new suppliers can be found and will provide funding which enables the Official Receiver to retain the employees working on those contracts. Work has paused on construction sites, pending decisions as to how and if they will be restarted. Speaking of job losses, a Bank of England policymaker has suggested that UK unemployment will actually keep falling. Michael Saunders used a speech in London this morning to suggest Britain\u2019s record-beating unemployment rate, already at its lowest point since the mid 1970s, can fall even further still. Although most economists now think the jobless rate could have reached its nadir at 4.3%, comparable with the level in June 1975, as the economy begins to slow, Saunders said it could reach 4% in 2018, or fall even further still. Saunders, who joined the committee just three days after August\u2019s emergency Brexit package was unveiled, also said it was his \u201chunch\u201d that workers\u2019 pay would rise further than most people expect this year. Wages could go up to about 3% and probably a little higher next year, he said. All of this would have implications for interest rates rising further, as the Bank has kept a watching brief on pay growth, waiting for wages to rise before it can hike the cost of borrowing even further still, after its first rate hike in a decade in November. However, all of this is very much inkeeping with Saunders\u2019 previous comments that low levels of unemployment should lead to pay growth, which he has used before to justify voting for higher rates. The City is unlikely to view this as a key moment that will inform the next decision from Threadneedle Street, due on the 8th February. Jeremy Corbyn also laid into Theresa May over wider issue of privatisations. He argues that the system is broken, and that the \u201ccostly racket\u201d of employing firms such as Carillion, Capita and Virgin to run privatised services must end. In response, May accuses Labour of putting \u201cpolitics before people\u201d through its opposition to businesses, and points out that a third of Carillion\u2019s contracts were signed under Labour. Here\u2019s my colleague Andy Sparrow\u2019s snap verdict, from his Politics Live blog. PMQs - Snap verdict: One of the best PMQs for ages, with strong, detailed questions, the prime minister being properly held to account, and Corbyn and May using the exchanges to make big, political arguments. Corbyn comfortably come off best - he has the wind behind him on this issue - but May managed to pull it back a bit with her final answer. Until then, although clearly across the detail of her brief, she struck the wrong tone in at least two places. Refusing to engage with Corbyn second question just because it did not conclude with a question mark sounded petty, and her repeated insistence that the government was just a \u201ccustomer\u201d of Carillion, while technically correct, made her sound rather feeble. She\u2019s not just a customer - she\u2019s the prime minister, armed with the full power and authority of the UK state. May came to office promising a crackdown on excessive corporate and a bolder and more imaginative PM would have use the Carillion catastrophe to reboot this whole agenda. Surprisingly, May did not even try to do this, and her response to Corbyn\u2019s question about what the Carillion directors are receiving sounded correct but uninspiring. That paved the way for Corbyn\u2019s powerful final question/soundbite, a tirade against the whole private sector contracting \u201cracquet\u201d. It was his best moment. May\u2019s final answer was her most effective too. Her argument about Corbyn and McDonnell being fundamentally anti-business is persuasive enough to have some traction, but attacking New Labour for putting these contracts out to tender in the first place was probably a mistake. If anyone is going to get credit of opposing New Labour neoliberalism on an issue like this, it\u2019s not going to be May, but Corbyn. Still at PMQs, Jeremy Corbyn asks Theresa May about the future of Carillion\u2019s army of staff, and its top brass. Q: Can she guarantee that no more money is handed to the chief executive and directors of Carillion, at a time when 8,000 workers on its private sector contracts face not being paid? The prime minister replies that some of those Carillion staff, who work on private sector contracts, will keep being paid. That\u2019s because companies have been hammering out agreements with the Official Receiver since it took control. May says: There are a number of facility management contractors who have come to an agreement with the Official Receiver which means their workers will continue to be paid. The official receiver is doing their job and working with these companies. On the bonuses, May says that the \u2018fast-track\u2019 investigation launched by the Receiver will investigate whether there was any misconduct by Carillion\u2019s top executive. She also denies that it was the government\u2019s job to ensure that Carillion was properly managed -- it was a customer, not the manager. And the government was right not to bail out a private company. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also challenges May about Carillion. Q: Why did the government hand Carillion \u00a32bn of contracts after it had issued a profits warning last summer? May explains that a profit warning means that a company is going to make lower profits than expected (indeed...) If the government pulled out everytime a company issued a profits warning, it would ensure that companies failed and jobs were lost, May says. And it would interrupt public services. Corbyn hits back, saying it\u2019s the government\u2019s responsibility to ensure that Carillion is being run properly. He says the government either handed Carillion contracts to keep it afloat (a strategy that failed) or it was simply negligent. There\u2019s a lot of rowdiness in the House of Commons, as Corbyn points out that hedge funds were betting against Carillion even as the government was meant to be monitoring it. Q: Why did the government withdraw its Crown Representative (a key oversight role) from the Carillion crisis last summer? May says there is now a new Crown Representative in place, replacing the one who left. In the interim, the government\u2019s chief commercial officer and the cabinet office director of markets and suppliers took over those responsibilities -- so it\u2019s not true that the government didn\u2019t have oversight. They clearly weren\u2019t looking very well, Corbyn shoots back (cue laughter on his back benches) Carillion went into liquidation with debts of \u00a31.29bn, and a pension deficit of \u00a3600m, he points out. As expected, Carillion is a big issue at PMQs (liveblog here) Here\u2019s a flavour: Q: How will the government guarantee that Carillion\u2019s apprentices are kept employed to complete their apprenticeships, and paid? Theresa May says she understands that it has been a \u201cdifficult time\u201d for many people, who are worried about their jobs and pensions. She says those who work for Carillion in the public sector should keep turning up to work, and they will be paid. But the government isn\u2019t running Carillion - it is a customer of Carillion. May reassures the House of Commons that the government is \u201clooking very carefully\u201d at the issue of apprentices. British banks are putting emergency measures into place to help small firms who are suffering from the collapse of Carillion. That\u2019s according to UK Finance, the trade body that represents the industry. Stephen Pegge, UK Finance\u2019s managing director for Commercial Finance, says banks want to help companies in Carillion\u2019s supply chain to keep trading: \u201cUK banks and the Government are working closely to make sure the impact of the Carillion liquidation on SMEs in the supply chain is understood and managed in a way that best supports those in need of assistance. Lenders are contacting customers and, where appropriate, are putting in place emergency measures, including overdraft extensions, payment holidays and fee waivers to ensure those facing short term issues can be helped to stay on track.\u201d This is a very important issue -- thousands of companies are facing financial losses, because they were owed money by Carillion which (probably) won\u2019t never be repaid. Over in parliament, Prime Minister\u2019s Questions is about to start. I imagine Carillion\u2019s liquidation might come up. Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the action, but I\u2019ll keep an eye too: Labour MP Jon Trickett, Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office, is concerned that the Cabinet Office is keeping a close eye on Interserve\u2019s finances. Trickett argues that the government was reckless in awarding new contracts to the firm, even after it posted several profit warnings last year. \u201cThe Government awarded Interserve numerous contracts after significant profit warnings, clearly showing us that Carillion was not an isolated case. \u201cThe Tory Government is wedded to a dogma which would rather see public services in private hands, so their shareholders cream off the profits and the British people pick up the bill. \u201cEven when these huge firms are in unstable positions, the Government would rather risk our services than actually run them for the public . \u201cThe time is up on the few profiteering at the expense of the many.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story about Interserve: Interserve is not the next Carillion, says UK government Britain\u2019s architects are calling for a major rethink in how public sector contracts are awarded, in the light of the Carillion crisis. Adrian Dobson, executive director of the Royal Institute of British Architects, says the government\u2019s procurement process is flawed. Rules that are meant to guarantee high standards actually restrict competition, and make it too hard for small businesses to get involved, RIBA says. This means a small group of major companies get most of the deals, which is a big problem if they then run into difficulties. Dobson explains: Standard pre-qualification questionnaires (PQQs) tend to bias selection in favour of larger multi-disciplinary suppliers. In architecture this might be requirements to have three built projects of a similar type, high turnover or PI requirements and multiple accreditations. This leads to a reliance on a small pool of large companies such as Carillion; narrowing the talent pool and concentrating risk in too few hands. Smaller business, including architects, are often restricted to being tier 2 and 3 sub-contractors who are then particularly vulnerable to overhead financial collapses of this kind, where the cashflow crisis gets passed down the supply chain. Dobson also shares the concerns that a \u2018domino effect\u2019 could ripple through the construction sector: Carillion has around 20,000 workers in the UK, but there will also be a vast impact on the many sub-contractor firms that work with Carillion, including architects. The last significant bankruptcy in construction was ROK in 2010, which we understand had annual revenue of \u00a3715 million compared with Carillion\u2019s \u00a35,200 million; a huge difference in magnitude Incidentally, Interserve warned in October that it could breach the conditions agreed with its lenders, after a profit warning. Richard Fletcher of The Times points out that the warning signs have been building for a while... Interserve is like Carillion in one respect -- it may not be well known to the public, but it has a significant role in UK public life. It employs 80,000 worldwide, including 45,000 in the UK. It plays a role building offices and car parks, and offers cleaning, catering, security and maintenance services to a range of organisations. It is also Britain\u2019s largest provider of probation and rehabilitation services in England and Wales, and supervises approximately 40,000 medium-low risk offenders at any one time. And also like Carillion, it has kept winning government contracts after posting profit warnings. Press Association\u2019s Ben Woods explains: Despite flagging financial troubles towards the end of last year, Interserve has landed a number of hefty wins, including an extension on facility management services at the BBC worth \u00a3140m and a \u00a3227m Government contract to provide similar services for the Department for Work and Pensions. Breaking: The World Economic Forum has highlighted the threat to environment in its annual Global Risks report. The WEF says that the upturn in growth has led to economic risks being downgraded. But concerns are rising over extreme weather events, natural disasters, failure to adapt to climate change, biodiversity loss and man made natural disasters. Many of the experts surveyed by WEF also singled out \u2018weapons of mass destruction\u2019 as a key risk. Worryingly, many of the business leaders, economists and politicians who took part in the Risks report also expect military conflict to become a bigger risk this year. Breaking: Interserve has hit back at suggestions that its financial health is weakening. An Interserve spokesperson says that the company is still performing as expected, and that its operating profits could actually beat City forecasts. The company also insists there\u2019s nothing untoward regarding its contact with the Cabinet Office. Here\u2019s the official statement, following the FT\u2019s report that civil servants are concerned. \u201cLast week we announced that we expect our 2017 performance to be in-line with expectations outlined in October and that our transformation plan is expected to deliver \u00a340m-\u00a350m benefit by 2020. This remains the case and we expect our 2018 operating profit to be ahead of current market expectations and we continue to have constructive discussions with lenders over longer-term funding. We are keeping the Cabinet Office closely appraised of our progress as would be expected.\u201d Interserve shares are recovering some of their losses, following that vote of confidence from the Cabinet Office. They\u2019re now down just 4%. The Cabinet Office says it does not believe any of its suppliers are facing the same problems as Carillion. Responding to the FT\u2019s report that it is monitoring Interserve, a spokesperson says: We monitor the financial health of all of our strategic suppliers, including Interserve. We are in regular discussions with all these companies regarding their financial position. We do not believe that any of our strategic suppliers are in a comparable position to Carillion. Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB union, has called on the government not to throw Carillion workers in the private sector to the wolves. Speaking on Radio 4, Roache urged other firms working alongside the failed company to take them on. \u201cWe want other private sector companies to take on Carillion workers with decent terms and conditions. But that takes time. The government response to say if that hasn\u2019t happened in 48 hours then here\u2019s the JobcentrePlus address - that\u2019s a scandal. What we said to Greg Clark yesterday is we need more time and the companies need more time\u201d Roache also said there should be a \u201cmoratorium on outsourcing\u201d while the failure of Carillion is investigated. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital insists that Interserve is \u201cno Carillion\u201d, following the FT\u2019s report about Cabinet Office concerns this morning. He writes: It\u2019s one of the most heavily shorted FTSE stocks and it has a lot of debt. Net debt was c\u00a3513m at year-end but is set to peak in the first half of 2018 as a result of refinancing, restructuring and cash flows phasing from its energy to waste contracts that were the source of the original profits warnings. However in the case of Interserve, the arithmetic doesn\u2019t look anything like as bad as Carillion. Even if net debt tops \u00a3600m in H1 2018m, its market cap as of Tuesday\u2019s close was \u00a3176m, although this is likely to be lower today. Carillion was facing oblivion as its market cap declined to just \u00a361m against liabilities of c\u00a31.5bn. It\u2019s been winning contracts too, although as Carillion reveals, this doesn\u2019t mean an awful lot if the lenders are ready to pull the rug out. Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever points out that Interserve\u2019s share price is often volatile, as investors weigh up its financial strength: Over in the City, shares in outsourcer Interserve have tumbled by over 10% in early trading. This seems to be triggered by a report in the Financial Times that a team of UK Cabinet Office officials are watching the company closely. Interserve provides a range of services to the UK public sector, including healthcare, construction and probation services. According to the FT, civil servants have put the company under scrutiny after it released a profit warning last year. Here\u2019s a flavour of their report: Interserve has come under pressure from the increase in the national minimum wage as well as large losses on a waste-to-energy project in Glasgow. Not only are a number of investors betting that the group\u2019s share price will fall but some of its debt is trading at a steep discount to face value. \u201cMinisters are very worried about Interserve, but the team is small and low-key as they are not wanting to unsettle,\u201d said one official. Another government aide confirmed that Interserve was being \u201cmonitored\u201d but said there was \u201cno comparison\u201d with Carillion: \u201cThere are regular discussions with all of our 30 strategic suppliers.\u201d Interserve\u2019s shares tumbled at the open, down as much as 15% to 102.3p, from 121p last night. Here\u2019s that domino effect in action: Construction experts have warned that Carillion\u2019s downfall could trigger a \u201cdomino effect\u201d among smaller sub-contractors. Brian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders, fears many \u201cinnocent victims\u201d will be brought down, if projects which had been outsourced to Carillion are put on hold. Berry told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme: \u201cNow we are in a very precarious position where thousands of workers don\u2019t know quite what their position is and often they can\u2019t get on site. \u201cCarillion actually aren\u2019t doing the work, they are relying on sub-contractors to do the actual building work. \u201cThose companies are relying on the money coming from Carillion, that has stopped.\u201d Many of Carillion\u2019s suppliers have been left with unpaid invoices for work done in recent weeks. They fear that these bills may not be paid by the Official Receiver -- as creditors are only expected to get a few pence for every pound they are owed. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. The collapse of Carillion continues to loom over the UK economy, as tens of thousands of workers face the threat of redundancy. Some 30,000 UK firms are thought to be owed money by the stricken construction and services group, forcing some to start laying off staff. That process could intensify today, as the government only offered Carillion-exposed companies will only receive two days of government support. Last night, union bosses urged the government to do more to protect jobs and public services which had been outsourced to Carillion, which fell into liquidation on Monday morning with huge debts, and a pension black hole. As we report this morning: Subcontractors owed money by the construction and services giant are already being pressurised by their banks and have begun laying off workers, as the threat of contagion afflicting the sector was likened to a near re-run of the banking crisis. Andrew Adonis, the former Labour transport minister, said: \u201cIt is a bit like Lehman Brothers [the Wall Street investment bank that collapsed in 2008]. You don\u2019t know what the impact will be. A very large part of Carillion\u2019s work was project management where subcontractors do the work, but these subcontractors don\u2019t know if they will be paid.\u201d The World Economic Forum is releasing its latest Global Risks Report 2018 this morning, ahead of next week\u2019s gathering in Davos. It will identify the main threat facing the global economy, from geopolitics to climate change. We\u2019ll also be watching cryptocurrencies after yesterday\u2019s selloff. Overnight, bitcoin plunged close to $10,000, as fears of a regulatory crackdown bit. European stock markets are expected to fall too:",

Here is their note:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>MITIE 5% probability-weighted revenue upside.</strong> In our view, MITIE has the widest array of opportunities as it offers similar services to Carillion and has a considerably lower market share in public sector than private. Facilities management contracts at Heathrow Airport (where MITIE has provided services since 2010), Centrica (MITIE\u2019s new CEO is ex-Centrica), Mapeley HMRC, Nationwide and Prisons FM all offer upside. Although balance sheet uncertainty and the FCA investigation into the timing of the September profit warning under previous management could count against it, the recent \u00a3525m Home Office immigration detainees escort contract suggests otherwise.</p> <p> <strong>Serco 3% probability-weighted revenue upside, but 7-8% EPS impact due to current low margins.</strong> In December 2017, Serco signed a Business Purchase Agreement to acquire a portfolio of selected UK health facilities management contracts from Carillion for \u00a347.7m. Carillion is now in breach of the BPA so Serco could walk away, renegotiate, or deal directly with the individual special purpose vehicle operating contract holders. In our view, management remains committed to completing the transaction, may accelerate transition from the original schedule, and seek dialogue with Carillion\u2019s remaining healthcare contracts (up to \u00a360m additional revenue). Elsewhere, Prisons FM, Hestia and Allenby/Connaught may also offer upside.</p> <p><strong>Babcock 2% probability-weighted revenue upside.</strong> In our view, Babcock could generate additional revenue from two areas: 1) Almost ten years ago, Network Rail transferred business to Babcock after the demise of Jarvis and \u00a330-40m of Carillion\u2019s track renewal and electrification business could follow a similar path; 2) The Next Generation Estate Contracts as Babcock previously operated two regions and has a long-standing, deep and supportive relationship with the MoD. Although it will wish to be a supportive partner to the MoD, these contracts were loss-making and require viable economic terms.</p> <p><strong>Sodexo 1% probability-weighted revenue upside.</strong> In our view, Sodexo also has a wide array of opportunities including facilities management contracts at Mapeley HMRC, Nationwide, Prisons FM, Hestia, Northwood Joint Permanent HQ, and Allenby Connaught PFI. However, the probability-weighted impact on group organic revenue growth would be a mere 1%.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a5f8afee4b092da99aa753c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-17T17:51:03.866Z\">5.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are several companies which could replace Carillion on public contracts, says Fitch Ratings, but any additional costs will depend on the individual project. The ratings agency - which did not rate Carillion and says the engineering and construction sector is generally sub-investment grade - said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The implications of Carillion\u2019s collapse for the UK PFI/PPP sector will vary between projects. There are several companies that could replace Carillion on individual projects, but replacement costs on construction projects will depend on how advanced construction is, and on how much money, if any, is owed to sub-contractors.</p> <p>Similarly, the availability of suitably qualified replacement operators and the project\u2019s ability to absorb the potential for increased costs and delays if the operator is replaced, is an important consideration in our project ratings analysis. Fitch does not rate any PFI/PPP project that has Carillion as a contractor or service provider. The fact that the company has gone into liquidation suggests there is no value in some of its existing contracts and that they were under-priced. This implies that replacement costs will have to compensate the new contractor/operator for that under-pricing.</p> <p>Carillion had a number of joint ventures with other established construction companies which should be well-placed to understand replacement risk. If Fitch considers the availability of substitute operators unlikely, given the specialised nature, size, or location of a project, our rating may be capped at that of the operator.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a5f7bcee4b0091abd8c8f44\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-17T17:24:45.799Z\">5.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeTrefgarne/status/953677564421296129\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Interesting sub-detail of the Carillion saga, hedge funds going short is being seen as a &quot;warning signal&quot; as opposed to &quot;locusts&quot; etc, even by Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.

Economist James Knightley at ING gives the background:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Canadian economy is strong and inflation pressures are rising, hence why the BoC hiked. But fears over the future of NAFTA are causing concern. This is key for the future path for interest rates</p> <p>Following a raft of strong activity data and a pick-up in inflation the Bank of Canada raised the target for its overnight rate to 1.25%. This was broadly the view amongst economists and in financial markets, which had swung behind the idea of a rate rise following two consecutive bumper Canadian jobs reports and stronger inflation readings.</p> <p>This was reflected in the accompanying statement, which stated that \u201clabour market slack is being absorbed more quickly than anticipated\u201d. It also highlighted strong data, inflation being close to target and the belief that the \u201ceconomy is operating roughly at capacity\u201d as reasons to raise interest rates.</p> <p>They are expecting to see a slowdown in 2018, but have had to acknowledge that \u201cgrowth is expected to remain above potential through the first quarter of 2018\u201d.</p> <p>Nonetheless, there are clearly risks, most notably the potential for Donald Trump to pull the plug on NAFTA. US-Canadian trade flows total an amount equivalent to 32% of Canadian GDP so disruption would be very bad news. Uncertainty on this issue is \u201cclouding the economic outlook\u201d according to the statement, which is likely to weigh on business investment and trade in their view.</p> <p>Consequently, the BoC still see the need for \u201csome continued monetary policy accommodation\u201d and warn that the Governing Council will \u201cremain cautious in considering future policy adjustments\u201d. Despite this the \u201ceconomic outlook is expected to warrant higher interest rates over time\u201d.</p> <p>We certainly agree and see further upside to Canadian growth given the improving global backdrop and rising commodity demand. We are also encouraged by Trump\u2019s recent comments, hinting at a growing willingness to work with Mexico and Canada on a NAFTA compromise. As such we are predicting a two more 25bp hikes in the second half of 2018. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a5f6976e4b0fe5e06bfbbaa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-17T15:22:18.481Z\">3.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the Press Association story on the Carillion directors\u2019 bonuses:</p> <blockquote> <p>Bonus payments to directors and former executives at collapsed construction giant Carillion have been stopped.</p> <p>The move came amid political anger about bumper payments to executives who had been in charge as the firm headed for the rocks.

Until then, although clearly across the detail of her brief, she struck the wrong tone in at least two places. Refusing to engage with Corbyn second question just because it did not conclude with a question mark sounded petty, and her repeated insistence that the government was just a \u201ccustomer\u201d of Carillion, while technically correct, made her sound rather feeble.</p> <p>She\u2019s not just a customer - she\u2019s the prime minister, armed with the full power and authority of the UK state. May came to office promising a crackdown on excessive corporate and a bolder and more imaginative PM would have use the Carillion catastrophe to reboot this whole agenda. Surprisingly, May did not even try to do this, and her response to Corbyn\u2019s question about what the Carillion directors are receiving sounded correct but uninspiring. That paved the way for Corbyn\u2019s powerful final question/soundbite, a tirade against the whole private sector contracting \u201cracquet\u201d. It was his best moment. May\u2019s final answer was her most effective too.</p> <p>Her argument about Corbyn and McDonnell being fundamentally anti-business is persuasive enough to have some traction, but attacking New Labour for putting these contracts out to tender in the first place was probably a mistake. If anyone is going to get credit of opposing New Labour neoliberalism on an issue like this, it\u2019s not going to be May, but Corbyn.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jan/17/juncker-urges-uk-to-stay-in-eu-and-says-hed-be-happy-to-have-it-back-if-it-goes-politics-live\">Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs -  Politics live</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a5f3f43e4b003d428b09e83\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-17T12:27:44.934Z\">12.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">May: Some private sector Carillion workers will keep being paid</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Still at PMQs, Jeremy Corbyn asks Theresa May about the future of Carillion\u2019s army of staff, and its top brass.</strong></p> <p><em>Q: Can she guarantee that no more money is handed to the chief executive and directors of Carillion, at a time when 8,000 workers on its private sector contracts face not being paid?</em></p> <p>The prime minister replies that some of those Carillion staff, who work on private sector contracts, will keep being paid.</p> <p>That\u2019s because companies have been hammering out agreements with the Official Receiver since it took control.</p> <p>May says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are a number of facility management contractors who have come to an agreement with the Official Receiver which means their workers will continue to be paid.</p> <p>The official receiver is doing their job and working with these companies.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the bonuses, May says that the \u2018fast-track\u2019 investigation launched by the Receiver will investigate whether there was any misconduct by Carillion\u2019s top executive.</p> <p>She also denies that it was the government\u2019s job to ensure that Carillion was properly managed -- it was a customer, not the manager.

    "webTitle": "Queensland councils say they won't own Adani airport despite paying $34m", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Two Queensland councils that together contributed $34m to an airport serving Adani\u2019s coalmine have contradicted previous statements and now say they do not own the site or have any say in how the facility is built. Townsville and Rockhampton councils announced in October that they would spend $18.5m and $15.5m respectively on an airport hundreds of kilometres away at the Carmichael coalmine as part of a funding deal with Adani. At the time, officials from Townsville council publicly stated the $34m was to \u201cbuild and own the airport\u201d. But after Queensland\u2019s corruption watchdog referred allegations of wrongdoing to the state\u2019s local government department, the councils have admitted that if the mine went ahead they would not own the airport. The agreement with Adani, the councils said in October, would add millions of dollars and thousands of jobs to the two economies by making both cities \u201cFifo hubs\u201d (fly in, fly out) for the mine. The Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission has referred the funding deal to the state\u2019s local government department because of \u201calleged corrupt conduct\u201d relating to a tender to build the airport. The allegation \u2013 prompted by a complaint made by the Townsville businessman Philip Batty \u2013 is that construction company Wagners was awarded the tender to develop the airstrip without council input. Wagners \u2013 a publicly listed Toowoomba-based firm \u2013 made a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange this week, saying after a \u201ccompetitive tender process\u201d it was negotiating the \u201cpotential future construction\u201d of the airport directly with Adani. But a publicly available list of previously awarded tenders for the mine did not include the construction of the airport and Adani refused to answer questions put to it by Guardian Australia. The complaint hinges on whether Townsville and Rockhampton councils own the airport or are funding its construction for Adani. The CCC initially rejected Batty\u2019s complaint on the basis of advice from the local government department that the councils did not own the airport and as such were not responsible for the tender. But it agreed to refer it after Batty pointed to occasions where council officials had suggested otherwise. In October, the Townsville mayor, Jenny Hill, reportedly told the ABC the two councils would own the airport beyond the life of the mine. \u201cCouncillors yesterday approved the investment of up to $15.5m over two financial years in a joint venture with Rockhampton City Council, to build and own the airport down in the Galilee basin,\u201d she was quoted as saying. \u201cNow this airport will not only be for this project but for all the projects that are destined to open up in the Galilee.\u201d Others on Townsville council also believed the $18.5m was for the purchase of an airport. Paul Jacob was the only Townsville councillor to oppose the airport deal with Adani because he did not think there was sufficient return on the investment, but he says he believed the council was entering into a shared ownership deal with Rockhampton. \u201cBoth the CEO and the mayor said that we would own the airport, the money was like a half-ownership deal with Rockhampton,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now the more I\u2019m reading, it\u2019s confusing even for me as a councillor. There\u2019s mixed messages from both sides.\u201d In fact, both councils now say the airport is not theirs and would belong to Adani. A spokesman for Townsville council told the Guardian that both the land and airport would be owned by Adani and the two councils would operate it \u201cfor the life of the mine via an exclusive long-term lease\u201d. \u201cCouncil has nothing to do with the procurement process, that is entirely a contractual matter between Wagners and Adani,\u201d the spokesman said. Similarly, Rockhampton council told the Guardian it was a 30-year lease and that \u201cany questions regarding ownerships or construction of the airport should be directed to Adani\u201d. But if not owning the airport means the councils avoid trouble with the CCC over the Wagners tender, it is cold comfort to Batty. \u201cIt basically means we\u2019re paying $18.5m for something we don\u2019t own,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re paying Wagners on behalf of Adani when we don\u2019t have a contract with Wagners. It\u2019s really messy.\u201d The agreement between the two councils and Adani remains hidden, so other questions about the terms of the deal also remain hidden. For example, asked whether under the agreement Adani could still fly workers in and out of other airports such as Brisbane, the Townsville council spokesman said there were \u201cconditions in place to make sure the Fifo jobs, and positions in Adani\u2019s headquarters, go to people living in Townsville\u201d. \u201cThere are also protections to ensure council doesn\u2019t spend money on the airstrip if the mine does not go ahead,\u201d the spokesman said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs announced its first quarterly loss in six years on Wednesday as a one-off hit from the Trump administration\u2019s tax overhaul wiped out profits. Financial institutions are expected to be the biggest winners of the Republicans\u2019 recently passed tax plan \u2013 but adjusting to the new regime is expensive. Goldman took a $4.4bn charge in the quarter and posted a loss of $1.93bn as a result. Goldman is the latest bank to announce a one-time hit from the tax readjustment. On Tuesday, Citigroup said the change, largely related to the treatment of its foreign assets, would cost $22bn. But banks expect to win in the long run. JP Morgan said last week that it expects its tax rate to fall to 19% from 32%. Banks will also benefit from the new 20% tax rate for income from so-called pass-through companies, and analysts are expecting a big boost to profits from the change in the long run. Trump\u2019s tax plan, passed in December, is the biggest change to the US tax code in 30 years and slashes corporate tax rates. While the bill was cheered by Republicans the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren has called the tax cut a \u201c$2tn giveaway to giant corporations\u201d and warned that banks are likely to be its biggest beneficiaries. Goldman\u2019s latest quarterly results were also hurt by a slowdown in trading that has hurt its business and triggered layoffs at the bank. Fourth-quarter revenue from fixed-income trading fell 50% to levels last seen in the recession. But investment-banking revenue climbed 44% to $2.14bn. For the three months ending 31 December, Goldman\u2019s revenues were $7.83bn and the bank\u2019s net income was $2.26bn excluding the tax charge. \u201cWith the global economy poised to accelerate, new US tax legislation providing tailwinds and a leading franchise across our businesses, we are well positioned to serve our clients and make significant progress on the growth plan we outlined in September,\u201d said Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer.",

Goldman took a $4.4bn charge in the quarter and posted a loss of $1.93bn as a result.</p> <p>Goldman is the latest bank to announce a one-time hit from the tax readjustment. On Tuesday, Citigroup said the change, largely related to the treatment of its foreign assets, would cost $22bn.</p> <p>But banks expect to win in the long run. JP Morgan said last week that it expects its tax rate to fall to 19% from 32%. Banks will also benefit from the new 20% tax rate for income from so-called pass-through companies, and analysts are expecting a big boost to profits from the change in the long run.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s tax plan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/19/donald-trump-tax-bill-plan-house-approves-senate\">passed in December</a>, is the biggest change to the US tax code in 30 years and slashes corporate tax rates.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Theresa May has defended her actions over Carillion, telling the Commons during prime minister\u2019s questions that the government was merely \u201ca customer\u201d of the collapsed public services provider, as Jeremy Corbyn criticised her over the issue. May said that halting any new contracts with Carillion when it began issuing profit warnings last year would only have initiated the company\u2019s demise, and insisted the government had been prudent in its dealing with the firm. In response, the Labour leader accused May and her ministers of negligence, and lambasted the wider system of providing public services through companies such as Carillion, Virgin, G4S and Capita. May was placed under heavy pressure over Carillion from the start of the session, with Labour MP Catherine McKinnell beginning by highlighting the plight of 1,400 apprentices who, she said, now did not know if they would be able to complete their training. The prime minister responded: \u201cI recognise that of course this has been a difficult time for a number of people, concerned about their jobs, about public services, and about pensions.\u201d Reiterating that all Carillion employees on public service contracts would still be paid, May said: \u201cBut of course the government is not running Carillion, the government is actually a customer of Carillion, and our focus has been on ensuring that we are providing the public services, that they are continuing to be provided uninterrupted, to reassure workers on those public services that they\u2019ll get paid, to reassure the pensioners and make sure the support is there for them.\u201d On the apprentices, the government was \u201clooking very carefully\u201d at what action could be taken, May said. Corbyn began by asking why the government had signed \u00a32bn-worth of contracts with the firm in the last six months, \u201ceven after the share price was in freefall and the company had issued profit warnings\u201d. May responded by saying that to refuse to do any more business with firms after they released a profit warning \u201cwould be the best way to ensure that companies failed and jobs were lost\u201d. In a section that brought frenzied shouting from MPs on both sides of the Commons, Corbyn followed this up with a comment not phrased as a question, to which May declined to respond. \u201cIt looks like the government was handing Carillion public contracts either to keep the company afloat, which clearly hasn\u2019t worked, or it was just deeply negligent of the crisis that was coming down the line,\u201d Corbyn said. The prime minister responded: \u201cI\u2019m very happy to answer questions when the right honourable gentleman asks one. He didn\u2019t.\u201d Corbyn criticised the resulting gleeful cheers from May\u2019s side of the house: \u201cTory MPs might shout, but the reality is, today, over 20,000 Carillion workers are very worried about their future, and for many of them the only recourse is to phone a DWP hotline.\u201d He went on to condemn the continued payments and high bonuses to Carillion\u2019s management, with May saying the official receiver would look into the issue, although she did not condemn the payments. The Labour leader concluded with his now-standard summation of the issue debated, arguing that the government needed to take over outsourced public services. \u201cThis isn\u2019t one isolated case of government negligence and corporate failure. It\u2019s a broken system,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder this government, Virgin and Stagecoach can spectacularly mismanage the East Coast mainline and be let off a \u00a32bn payment. Capita and Atos can continue to wreck lives through damaging disability assessments of many people with disability and win more government-funded contracts. \u201cG4S promised to provide security at the Olympics, failed to do so, and the army had to step in and save the day. These corporations need to be shown the door. \u201cWe need our public services provided by public employees with a public service ethos, and a strong public oversight. As the ruins of Carillion lie around her, will the prime minister act to end this costly racket of the relationship between government and some of these companies?\u201d May responded by saying that a third of such contracts had been signed under a Labour government, and condemned Corbyn\u2019s general economic policies. She said: \u201cThis is a Labour party that has turned its back on investment, on growth, on jobs, a Labour party that will always put politics before people.\u201d",

The terms of the cash and share deal are unchanged since Melrose\u2019s initial approach was revealed on Friday, consisting of 1.49 Melrose shares and 81p in cash for every GKN share. But a rise in Melrose\u2019s share price since Friday from 215p to 230p means the value of the offer has increased from 405p a share to 423p. In the market GKN has added 0.2p to 442.2p, with the City betting either on a higher bid from Melrose or a rival bidder. Melrose made its firm offer after both sides began lobbying GKN shareholders in a series of meetings which are continuing. The activist investor Elliott has already begun urging GKN to open talks with Melrose. Simon Peckham, the Melrose chief executive, said: \u201cWe are having discussions with shareholders about the potential for the merged business, which will be one of the largest companies in the UK.\u201d But GKN, which has put forward its own plans to split the company in two, said the benefits of any turnaround should go to its own investors. Its chief executive, Anne Stevens, said: \u201cWe believe GKN\u2019s current owners should retain all the benefits of the clear upside potential in GKN. We are actively engaging with shareholders to explain how our transformation plan will provide value.\u201d Matthias Heck, an analyst at Moody\u2019s, said a demerger would be negative for GKN\u2019s credit rating \u201cbecause the scale of separated activities will be smaller and there will be less product diversification\u201d. Meanwhile GKN\u2019s pension trustees said any potential buyer should be aware of its \u00a31bn-plus deficit, adding: \u201cAny material change to the corporate and capital structure of GKN would lead the trustees to reassess the strength of the covenant going forward.\u201d A Melrose spokesperson said: \u201cMelrose has an impeccable track record of safeguarding and improving pensioners\u2019 rights in every acquisition we have made.

    "webTitle": "Burberry UK sales slump as Chinese shopping spree ends", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Burberry has reported a slump in sales as a luxury tourism shopping spree in the UK comes to an end. The British brand known for its trenchcoats said sales at established UK stores were down by about 8% in the three months to 31 December, largely because of a drop in the number of high-spending visitors from China. Global retail sales at Burberry\u2019s established stores rose 2%, disappointing expectations in the City of a 3% rise. There was also disappointment that the brand did not announce a new creative director to replace Christopher Bailey, who will leave in March after 17 years. Shares in Burberry fell 8% to \u00a316.43 in early trading on Wednesday after the company said Chinese tourists, who made up a large proportion of overseas shoppers in the UK last year, were heading elsewhere, including Japan. A year ago, Burberry\u2019s UK sales rose by 40% as overseas bargain hunters made the most of the slump in sterling after the Brexit vote. Some shoppers consider exchange rates and travel fees when deciding where to buy luxury handbags or trenchcoats, which can cost more than \u00a31,000 each. The fall in the value of the pound made the UK an attractive shopping destination in late 2016, but sterling has since stabilised. Burberry said it remained on track to deliver profits because it would make \u00a360m of cost savings this year. Sales continued to rise in China, the US and the rest of Europe. Total reported sales fell by 2% as Burberry closed 1% of its retail space, including an outlet in Asia. Marco Gobbetti, who took over as chief executive in July, said: \u201cWe are building on strong foundations and are fully focused on the successful delivery of our multiyear plan to position Burberry firmly in luxury and deliver long-term sustainable value.\u201d Gobbetti wants to spend about \u00a350m a year reinventing Burberry as a \u201csuper-luxury\u201d brand.

      "bodyText": "The president of the European Central Bank has been told by the EU\u2019s watchdog he should drop his membership of a secretive club of corporate bankers, after claims the group had been given an inside seat from which it could influence key policies. Following a year-long investigation, Mario Draghi was informed on Wednesday by the European ombudsman, Emily O\u2019Reilly, that his close relationship with the Washington-based G30 group threatened the reputation of the bank, despite his assurances to the contrary. Members of the exclusive club, of which only two of the current 33 are women, are chosen by an anonymous board of trustees, it emerged during the ombudsman\u2019s investigation. Only the identity of the chair of the trustees, Jacob A Frenkel, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase International, has been made public. O\u2019Reilly noted the group\u2019s secrecy and lack of transparency over the content of its meetings. She additionally called for a ban on all future presidents of the ECB taking up membership of the club, previously named the Consultative Group on International Economic and Monetary Affairs. The ruling followed a complaint by the Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO), a Brussels-based NGO, which claimed Draghi\u2019s close relationship to G30 was in contravention of the ECB\u2019s ethical code. During his presidency of the ECB, Draghi, an Italian economist who previously worked at Goldman Sachs, has attended four G30 meetings, in 2012, 2013 and twice in 2015. O\u2019Reilly said there was a danger that the bank\u2019s independence could be perceived to have been compromised by Draghi\u2019s involvement with the group, whose members include a number of central bank governors, private sector bankers and academics. The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, is a member. But O\u2019Reilly said there was no evidence of sensitive information being shared. The ombudsman said: \u201cThe ECB takes decisions that directly affect the lives of millions of citizens. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, and in consideration of the additional powers given to the ECB in recent years to supervise member state banks in the public interest, it is important to demonstrate to that public that there is a clear separation between the ECB as supervisor and the finance industry which is affected by its decisions.\u201d O\u2019Reilly said any meetings between the ECB and the G30 should in future be made public and summaries should be provided of the discussions. A complaint in 2012 had been dismissed by the ombudsman, but O\u2019Reilly said times had moved on and the ECB had failed to show how the public benefited from Draghi\u2019s membership. The relationship between the bank and the G30 should \u201cbe in alignment with certain of the bank\u2019s own governance rules and codes\u201d, she said. A spokesman for the ECB said it had taken note of the ruling and would respond in due course.",

It followed a report in the Financial Times that said the Cabinet Office had set up a team of officials to monitor the company, following concerns over its financial health. Interserve shares initially tumbled 15% after the report, before recovering with a fall of just 1%. A spokesperson for the Cabinet Office said: \u201cWe monitor the financial health of all of our strategic suppliers, including Interserve. We are in regular discussions with all these companies regarding their financial position. \u201cWe do not believe that any of our strategic suppliers are in a comparable position to Carillion.\u201d Interserve is a major supplier to the government across a range of areas including health, education and defence. The company issued profit warnings in September and October last year, after it ran into difficulty on a number of waste-to-energy contracts that deal with generating energy in the form of electricity and/or heat from the primary treatment of waste. It had net debts of about \u00a3513m at the end of 2017. However, in a trading update on 10 January, the company said it expected operating profit in 2018 to be better than City analysts were forecasting. Responding to the FT report, a spokesperson for Interserve said: \u201cLast week we announced that we expect our 2017 performance to be in line with expectations outlined in October and that our transformation plan is expected to deliver \u00a340m-\u00a350m benefit by 2020. This remains the case and we expect our 2018 operating profit to be ahead of current market expectations and we continue to have constructive discussions with lenders over longer-term funding. \u201cWe are keeping the Cabinet Office closely appraised of our progress as would be expected.\u201d Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said Interserve had had its problems but was \u201cno Carillion\u201d. He added: \u201cComparisons with Carillon are all too easy to make of course \u2013 a diverse business operating on thin margins. It has faced pressure from employment and contract mobilisation costs and margin deterioration from a cost base which has not been flexible enough. It\u2019s one of the most heavily shorted FTSE stocks and it has a lot of debt. \u201cHowever in the case of Interserve, the arithmetic doesn\u2019t look anything like as bad as Carillion.\u201d Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Almost half a million UK businesses have started 2018 in significant financial distress, according to insolvency specialists. In its latest \u201cred flag alert\u201d, Begbies Traynor said firms across all UK regions and sectors were feeling the repercussions of higher inflation, rising interest rates, growing business uncertainty, and weaker consumer spending. Ric Traynor, executive chairman of Begbies Traynor, said many firms had been hurt by the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote, which drives up the cost of goods imported from abroad. \u201cProlonged exchange rate weakness undoubtedly hit some businesses hard last year and despite a recent recovery in sterling, this improvement is yet to feed through in terms of any widespread recovery in corporate health. \u201cMeanwhile, the impact of continued political and economic uncertainty surrounding the ongoing Brexit negotiations cannot be underestimated.\u201d A total of 493,296 businesses were experiencing significant financial distress in the final quarter of 2017 according to Begbies\u2019 latest \u201cred flag alert\u201d, which monitors the health of UK companies. That was 36% higher than at the same point in 2016, and 10% higher than in the third quarter of 2017. Traynor said the thousands of UK firms in financial distress would have to find ways to cut costs and improve productivity in order to ensure survival beyond the next 12 months. The warning came in the week that Carillion, a construction firm employing 19,500 people in the UK, collapsed under a mountain of unsustainable debts. As 2018 got under way, financial distress was common among support services firms according to the Begbies report, as customers reined in spending. A total of 121,095 businesses in the sector were showing signs of financial difficulty, up 43% on a year earlier. Firms in the construction and property sectors also experienced a spike in financial distress. Geographically, London was the region with the highest number of affected businesses, with 121,528 companies ending 2017 in significant financial distress. The capital accounted for 25% of businesses in distress nationally. Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "body": "<p>Almost half a million UK businesses have started 2018 in significant financial distress, according to insolvency specialists.</p> <p>In its latest \u201cred flag alert\u201d, Begbies Traynor said firms across all UK regions and sectors were feeling the repercussions of higher inflation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/02/more-costly-mortgages-in-wake-of-rates-rise\">rising interest rates</a>, growing business uncertainty, and weaker consumer spending.</p> <p>Ric Traynor, executive chairman of Begbies Traynor, said many firms had been hurt by the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote, which drives up the cost of goods imported from abroad.</p> <p>\u201cProlonged exchange rate weakness undoubtedly hit some businesses hard last year and despite a recent recovery in sterling, this improvement is yet to feed through in terms of any widespread recovery in corporate health. </p> <p>\u201cMeanwhile, the impact of continued political and economic uncertainty surrounding the ongoing Brexit negotiations cannot be underestimated.\u201d</p> <p>A total of 493,296 businesses were experiencing significant financial distress in the final quarter of 2017 according to Begbies\u2019 latest \u201cred flag alert\u201d, which monitors the health of UK companies. That was 36% higher than at the same point in 2016, and 10% higher than in the third quarter of 2017.</p> <p>Traynor said the thousands of UK firms in financial distress would have to find ways to cut costs and improve productivity in order to ensure survival beyond the next 12 months.</p> <p>The warning came in the week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/carillion\">Carillion</a>, a construction firm employing 19,500 people in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/15/carillion-fallout-deepens-as-workers-face-pay-being-stopped-in-48-hours\">collapsed under a mountain of unsustainable debts</a>.</p> <p>As 2018 got under way, financial distress was common among support services firms according to the Begbies report, as customers reined in spending. A total of 121,095 businesses in the sector were showing signs of financial difficulty, up 43% on a year earlier.</p> <p>Firms in the construction and property sectors also experienced a spike in financial distress.</p> <p>Geographically, London was the region with the highest number of affected businesses, with 121,528 companies ending 2017 in significant financial distress. The capital accounted for 25% of businesses in distress nationally.</p> <ul> <li>Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.<br></li> </ul>",
