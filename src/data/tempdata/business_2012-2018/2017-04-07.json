      "bodyText": "Worries that the UK economy is losing steam have been strengthened by news of a housing market slowdown, a drop in industrial output and the weakest performance for a year by the construction industry. Economists on Friday said there was growing evidence that the UK economy slipped down a gear as it entered the new year, following a strong finish to 2016 that had confounded the doomsayers predicting a post-Brexit-vote slump. Now, 10 months on from the vote to leave the EU, economic indicators point to strains on companies from higher costs as the pound\u2019s slump makes imported materials and fuels more expensive. Consumers, the main driving force of UK economic growth, are also under pressure from rising inflation, with signs they are becoming less willing to spend in shops, restaurants and bars. The latest official figures for February painted a picture of economic growth easing after the robust 0.7% expansion in the final three months of 2016. The Office for National Statistics said: \u201cToday\u2019s data show that overall UK economic activity was relatively subdued in February, following strong growth across the headline industries at the end of 2016.\u201d The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said growth probably slipped to 0.5% in the first quarter, based on its its analysis of the latest official figures. \u201cA key component of this moderation has been relatively weak retail sales in the first two months of this year. Consumption is expected to moderate further this year as increasing inflation erodes households\u2019 purchasing power,\u201d said James Warren, research fellow at the thinktank. As a result, the Bank of England would likely ignore rising price pressures from the weak pound in favour of shoring up growth and be in no hurry to raise interest rates from their all-time low of 0.25%, he added. The ONS figures will disappoint commentators who hoped a boost to exports from the weak pound would offset the slowdown in consumer spending as households grapple with the double whammy of rising prices and sluggish pay growth. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said on Friday there were signs that strong consumer demand was \u201ccoming off slowly\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s what we expect but we\u2019ll monitor it and ensure that we chart the right path,\u201d he added at an event in London. The pound is down about 17% against the dollar and 11% against the euro since the referendum, making UK goods and services significantly cheaper to overseas buyers. A pound was worth just under $1.24 on Friday as the downbeat economic figures prompted investors to downgrade the UK\u2019s prospects. There has been some evidence of a boost to exports from the weaker pound but the latest trade figures showed Britain\u2019s deficit for goods and services trade widened in February as exports fell and imports rose. The deficit on goods alone widened to \u00a312.5bn from \u00a312bn in January and was significantly deeper than the \u00a310.9bn forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. The ONS cautioned, however, that the widening was mainly down to an increase in imports of erratic goods, a category that includes big items such as ships and aircraft and those with irregular trading patterns such as precious stones and gold. Its figures for industrial production showed output fell by 0.7% in February as warmer weather knocked household energy demand. That drop defied economists\u2019 forecasts of a 0.2% rise. Within the industrial sector, manufacturing output dipped 0.1%, also missing forecasts for a 0.3% rise. Jack Coy at the Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy said there was still a good chance manufacturing could help shore up the wider economy this year. \u201cBoosted by increased competitiveness from the weaker pound, manufacturers are enjoying bright prospects and strong order books. Furthermore, the exchange rate effect is likely to be magnified by strong demand in key export markets,\u201d he said. Figures for the construction sector showed that output fell 1.7% in February on the back of weaker infrastructure work and housebuilding. It was the biggest drop for almost a year and worse than forecasts for output to hold steady. The ONS said monthly construction figures were prone to swings and it noted three-month on three-month figures showed output continued to rise. There were also fresh signs of a housing market slowdown as Halifax, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, reported house prices were rising at their slowest annual pace for almost four years. They were up 3.8% in the three months to March compared with a year earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s now incontrovertible that the housing market has slowed sharply this year, indicating that the monetary policy committee\u2019s interest rate cut in August provided only a temporary stimulus to demand,\u201d said Samuel Tombs at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics.",

    "webTitle": "Brexit raises spectre of dearer Guinness and Baileys", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Cans of Guinness could be an unexpected casualty of Brexit if a new customs border or tariffs are introduced between the Republic and Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the European Union, it has emerged. Guinness is one of Ireland\u2019s most famous exports but Brexit will have a direct impact on its production as the black stuff crosses the Irish border twice before being shipped from Dublin to Britain and beyond. The stout is made at the St James\u2019s Gate brewery in Dublin. The drink is then pumped into tankers, known as \u201csilver bullets\u201d, and driven 90 miles to east Belfast where it is canned and then sent back to Dublin Port for onward distribution. Diageo, the Guinness owner, confirmed a Bloomberg report on Friday that it had estimated a so-called \u201chard border\u201d could cause delays of between 30 minutes and an hour, costing an extra \u20ac100 (\u00a385) for each lorry-load of Guinness. Each year the company makes 13,000 beer-related border crossings in Ireland and Guinness contingency plans estimate the delays could amount to \u20ac1.3m in additional costs a year. Diageo would either be forced to absorb that cost or pass it on to the consumer by raising the cost of a pint. All Guinness consumed in Britain has been produced in Dublin since Diageo closed the Park Royal operation in north-west London 12 years ago. Another brand owned by Diageo, Baileys liqueur, is also of concern in Ireland as some of its ingredients cross the border with Northern Ireland three times before its journey to Britain. The majority of cream from dairy milk in Baileys is produced in the Republic but Diageo confirmed that some comes from farms in Northern Ireland. The finished product is then sent to Belfast for bottling before returning to Dublin for export. There is political backing for maintaining a relatively open border between the Republic and Northern Ireland, with Irish, British and European leaders supporting the unique status of Ireland in the Brexit process. However, the European Union has admitted there is no firm plan for how to achieve this, saying \u201cflexible and imaginative solutions will be required\u201d to square the legal circle, which requires the Republic to operate customs of what will become an external border between the UK and the EU when Britain leaves the union. All-island Irish businesses that have flourished since the disappearance of the border when the single market came into being in 1993 are now facing up to the cost of Brexit. The Northern Ireland director for Dairy UK told the Northern Ireland affairs committee this year that farms would \u201cgo out of business\u201d if barriers to trade on the island were introduced. About 25% of Northern Irish milk goes south of the border to be processed, with cheese from the Republic going north to be packaged and exported again through Dublin Port. If tariffs are introduced those journeys may no longer be viable with margins so tight in the food sector. The Freight Transport Association in Belfast says nearly all food exports in Northern Ireland will impacted because so much of the produce from the six counties is exported through Dublin Port to Holyhead, the gateway for Britain and beyond. It is favoured by fresh food producers across Northern Ireland because it offers the quickest route to food processors in Wales and the midlands or supermarket shelves in Manchester, Birmingham and London. \u201cWe have suppliers here who have meat which leaves here at 6.30pm and is in south east England at 6.30am the next day,\u201d said Seamus Leheny, head of policy for Northern Ireland for the FTA. \u201cSome of these suppliers are now having to consider whether they can continue withe meat processing here or whether they move it to the UK.\u201d Kegs of draft Guinness being exported to the UK will also be impacted with customs expected to be reintroduced at Holyhead. Like all big name exporters, however, they are expected to continue with \u201ctrusted trader\u201d status which will rule out random customs checks.",

    "webTitle": "Rupert Murdoch's Sky takeover approved by European regulator", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s \u00a311.7bn bid to take full control of Sky has been cleared by the European competition regulator. The European commission, which has been investigating 21st Century Fox\u2019s takeover bid since early March, has given the deal \u201cunconditional approval\u201d. \u201cBased on the results of its market investigation, the Commission concluded that the proposed transaction would raise no competition concerns,\u201d it said. \u201cFox and Sky are mainly active in different markets in Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the UK. They compete with each other only to a limited extent, mainly in the acquisition of TV content and in the wholesale supply of basic pay-TV channels.\u201d Rivals have lodged submissions with the regulator, raising concerns that the combined broadcasters would dominate bidding for top-flight sport, TV shows and movies. The ruling \u2013 which was expected given the commission also cleared Murdoch\u2019s ill-fated 2010 bid \u2013 does not affect the investigation being conducted by Ofcom in the UK. The UK media regulator is currently assessing whether the takeover will give Murdoch too much control of news media in the UK, and whether he is a \u201cfit and proper\u201d owner of Sky. The deal would give the Murdoch family control of Sky News through 21st Century Fox (which already owns the Fox News service), and the Sun, Times and Sunday Times newspapers and the TalkSport radio station through News Corporation, a separate company. Ofcom is due to report back to Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, with the outcome of its investigation by 16 May. \u201c21st Century Fox welcomes today\u2019s decision by the European commission clearing unconditionally its proposed transaction to acquire the outstanding shares of Sky that it does not already own,\u201d said Fox in a statement. \u201cWe now look forward to continuing to work with UK authorities and are confident that the proposed transaction will be approved following a thorough review process.\u201d During the 2010 takeover bid by News Corp, which was derailed by the phone hacking scandal at the company, Murdoch reached an agreement with the government to spin off Sky News to satisfy media plurality concerns. This time round, James Murdoch, now the chief executive of Fox and chair of Sky, has said he does not expect to make any \u201cmeaningful concessions\u201d to get the deal through. Critics, such as former Labour leader Ed Miliband, argue that the Murdoch empire has not been reformed since the phone hacking scandal and has a record of \u201cpersistent disregard for the law and regulatory control\u201d. Fox claims that in the years since the abandoned bid, the media landscape has changed beyond recognition.

In its heyday, Jaeger dressed Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe, but in recent years it has struggled to stay relevant on a competitive high street. The retailer confirmed on Friday that it had filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators \u2013 a step that gives a company protection from creditors for 10 days before potentially tipping into administration. Last week, a mystery buyer bought all Jaeger\u2019s debts from the private equity firm Better Capital for \u00a37m. Better Capital, founded by Jon Moulton, had been searching for a buyer for the business for some time and admitted it was a disappointing result for a fashion brand it recently thought was worth \u00a330m. The owner of Jaeger\u2019s debts would be in the driving seat of any administration process as their status as a secured creditor ranks their interests ahead of other parties, such as suppliers. Industry sources believe that the Edinburgh Woollen Mill owner, Philip Day, who bought Austin Reed out of administration last year, is waiting in the wings to acquire a restructured business, casting doubt over the future of its 25 stores. Day already owns a stable of retail brands including Peacocks, Jane Norman, Ponden Home and ProQuip Golf. It is understood that Jaeger\u2019s staff have been briefed about the possibility of administration. Jaeger was founded in 1884 by Lewis Tomalin, an accountant who was inspired by a health craze promulgated by Gustav Jaeger, a professor of zoology from Stuttgart. Jaeger believed people would be healthier if they dressed in clothing made from animal hair, wool and fleece.

Earlier this year, Better Capital hired Alix Partners to flush out interest from potential partners or to find a buyer. Last year, Jaeger\u2019s sales fell from \u00a384.2m to \u00a378.4m, while it booked a pre-tax loss of \u00a35.4m, according to accounts filed at Companies House.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nicholas pads down the stairs of his apartment building on Broome Street in New York\u2019s Soho neighbourhood \u2013 where the cheapest two-bedroom unit costs more than $2m \u2013 in his boxers and a T-shirt to meet me on a Saturday afternoon. The twentysomething hands me two books and asks for them to be delivered to his friend\u2019s place 11 minutes away in the West Village. I am at Nicholas\u2019s beck and call \u2013 and anyone else\u2019s, if they have a smartphone \u2013 as an Uber courier. Delivering Nicholas\u2019s books \u2013 The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism and Empire As a Way of Life \u2013 earns me $5.60 (it costs him $7, as Uber takes 20% of all my earnings). Still, it equates to an hourly wage of $30.60 \u2013 far higher than the New York City minimum of $10.50. I did, however, spend three hours waiting for a job on the Uber Driver app, and he is my only client. As 8% of Americans and 14% of Britons have turned to the so-called \u201cgig economy\u201d to make ends meet, doing tasks such as driving for Uber or Lyft, cleaning apartments for Handy or doing odd jobs via TaskRabbit, I have joined them as an UberEats and UberRush cycle courier. The delivery services, which are used by restaurants to deliver lunch and dinner to office workers as well as to deliver packages for people like Nicholas, are some of the newest tentacles of the fast-growing Uber empire that has seen the seven-year-old Silicon Valley company\u2019s valuation soar to $68.5bn. Signing up is simple enough. I fill out an online form, watch a video explaining how the service works and take a test to make sure I\u2019m paying attention. After passing, I\u2019m rewarded with a link to download the app, and a flurry of text messages urging me to saddle up and get on with my new career. Joining companies like Uber is straightforward because workers are not classified as employees but self-employed contractors. This makes it much cheaper for the employer, as they don\u2019t have to grant workers access to healthcare, sickness benefit or holiday pay. This has led to high-profile strikes on both sides of the Atlantic, including Uber drivers in the US attempting a nationwide strike and repeated strikes by Deliveroo and Uber Eats takeaway delivery drivers in the UK. Politicians in the UK and the US have criticised gig economy companies for steadfastedly refusing to give workers benefits even if they are working in effect full-time for one employer. A committee of MPs last week criticised Uber for creating \u201cgibberish\u201d and \u201calmost unintelligible\u201d contracts to ensure that its drivers remained self-employed. Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions select committee in the UK, which is carrying out an investigation into the sector, published full details of contracts at Uber, the takeaway courier firm Deliveroo and Amazon. \u201cQuite frankly the Uber contract is gibberish,\u201d Field said. \u201cThe way they work looks in most ways an awful lot like being employed. \u201cThese companies parade the \u2018flexibility\u2019 their model offers to drivers but it seems the only real flexibility is enjoyed by the companies themselves. It does seem a marvellous business model if you can get away with it. \u201cMy worry is that as a result these companies contribute little to the public purse or our social safety net. They are not paying sick leave, national living wage, or contributing to pensions. Yet it seems likely that their employment practices will lead more people to need taxpayers to pick up these costs.\u201d In the UK, Uber lost a landmark employment tribunal that could affect the status of its 30,000 drivers in the country. In their ruling on the case, brought by two Uber drivers, the tribunal judges turned to Hamlet to criticise Uber for \u201cgrimly\u201d sticking to \u201cfaintly ridiculous\u201d arguments that it is an app and not a taxi service. \u201cThe lady doth protest too much, methinks,\u201d it said. Uber is appealing the ruling. It says it is revising its contracts in plainer English and that \u201cwe\u2019ve always been clear to drivers who use Uber that they are self-employed and free to choose if, when and where they drive, with no shifts, minimum hours or uniforms\u201d. As a courier back in New York, if it\u2019s going to rain tomorrow, I won\u2019t find out from the Weather Channel, but from Uber. Rain, snow or particularly cold weather means more profit for the company as demand increases, and it responds with price surges. It also means the potential for more earnings for the more than 1 million Uber drivers and cyclists around the world. (The cyclist option is currently only available in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto and Portland.) \u201cRain is forecast tomorrow and it will be one of the busiest days of the year so far!\u201d reads a text from Uber. \u201cWe are offering a $25 incentive for completing at least five trips throughout the day tomorrow \u2026 This is a HUGE opportunity to earn money so don\u2019t miss out.\u201d I fire up the app at lunchtime and wait for jobs to come pouring in. Soon my phone pings and a countdown begins, giving me 10 seconds to decide whether to accept a job. I accept and rush for the elevator, fearing any delay could jeopardise my five-star rating. Uber drivers and couriers are rated by each customer, and the company warns that any delays, breakages or perceived rudeness are likely to lead to poor ratings. Couriers and drivers also rate the customers. I give all my customers five stars except Nicholas, whom I give one star out of petulance at his laziness. This job is to collect a \u201cBuckaroo\u201d burger (beef, aged cheddar, brisket, wild mushroom and smoke sauce on a brioche bun) and fries from the trendy organic chain Bareburger in the Financial District and take it to a university lecturer 0.66 miles away. The delivery takes six minutes, earning me $4. Not bad, but the time it takes to collect goods is unpaid, as is the trip back to the starting point. The jobs aren\u2019t rolling in either, even though I am in one of Uber\u2019s designated busy zones in the financial heart of the city, where it has boosted fares by 1.4 times this lunchtime. The downtime is OK for me because I\u2019m fitting delivery around my day job writing articles, like this one, but for people turning full-time to gig economy jobs, excessive periods of downtime can make earning a consistent living precarious. Just two more jobs come in that day \u2013 delivering a falafel sandwich to a tech bro working alone in a huge empty office at the tip of Manhattan with views of the Statue of Liberty ($4.12, plus a $2 tip \u2013 thanks, man), and dispatching a letter from a downtown WeWork coworking space to Gillian at another WeWork in the West Village ($12.10) \u2013 so I fail to secure the $25 incentive. My luck appears to be looking up the next day as my phone pings at 10.31am, sending me to Cafe Patoro, a Brazilian bakery famous for its p\u00e3o de queijo (cheese-flavoured tapioca rolls). I am at the downtown cafe to pick up a half brigadeiro cake (a condensed milk and chocolate truffle, a national icon in Brazil since it was invented during the second world war, when it was difficult to source fresh milk). The cake is for Roberta Freitas, a Brazilian banker working on Lexington Avenue in Midtown who has ordered it for an office holiday party, where the multicultural team have been asked to each bring a delicacy from their home country. I set off cycling up the East River bike path, but soon realise Freitas\u2019s cake won\u2019t survive the journey in my satchel. Worried that I could ruin her office party and my five-star Uber rating, I lock my bike and take the subway uptown. A very smiley Freitas collects her cake, and I take the subway back downtown, only to find a very lonely lamppost where my bike was. My bike is not insured by Uber. When I eventually get hold of a human at Uber, I am told the only insurance cover is up to $1m to cover \u201cbodily injury or property damage to third parties where the claim arises out of UberEats and UberRush operations\u201d. Note it only pays out if I injure a third party; if an Uber cyclist gets knocked down by a cab, he or she will have to pay for his or her own ambulance/hearse. Freitas\u2019s cake doesn\u2019t appear to be insured, either. A spokeswoman says: \u201cIn terms of your question about dropping cupcakes (or breaking something during a delivery), this is something we examine on a case-by-case basis.\u201d A very short-lived cycle courier career over before it\u2019s properly begun, you might think. But not having a bike doesn\u2019t appear to faze Uber: with the swipe of a finger I turn from \u201cUber Bicycle\u201d to \u201cUber Walker\u201d, and with jobs like Nicholas\u2019s begins the slow attempt to earn enough money to buy a new bike. At the current rate of roughly one $6 job a day, it\u2019ll take just under a year. But I maintain my five-star rating.",

After passing, I\u2019m rewarded with a link to download the app, and a flurry of text messages urging me to saddle up and get on with my new career.<br></p> <p>Joining companies like Uber is straightforward because workers are not classified as employees but self-employed contractors. This makes it much cheaper for the employer, as they don\u2019t have to grant workers access to healthcare, sickness benefit or holiday pay. </p> <p>This has led to high-profile strikes on both sides of the Atlantic, including Uber drivers in the US attempting a nationwide strike and repeated strikes by Deliveroo and Uber Eats takeaway delivery drivers in the UK.</p> <p>Politicians in the UK and the US have criticised gig economy companies for steadfastedly refusing to give workers benefits even if they are working in effect full-time for one employer. A committee of MPs last week criticised Uber for creating \u201cgibberish\u201d and \u201calmost unintelligible\u201d contracts to ensure that its drivers remained self-employed.<br></p> <p>Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions select committee in the UK, which is carrying out an investigation into the sector, published full details of contracts at Uber, the takeaway courier firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/deliveroo\">Deliveroo</a> and Amazon. \u201cQuite frankly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/06/uber-contract-gibberish-says-mp-investigating-gig-economy\">the Uber contract is gibberish,\u201d Field said</a>. \u201cThe way they work looks in most ways an awful lot like being employed.</p> <p>\u201cThese companies parade the \u2018flexibility\u2019 their model offers to drivers but it seems the only real flexibility is enjoyed by the companies themselves. It does seem a marvellous business model if you can get away with it.</p> <p>\u201cMy worry is that as a result these companies contribute little to the public purse or our social safety net. They are not paying sick leave, national living wage, or contributing to pensions. Yet it seems likely that their employment practices will lead more people to need taxpayers to pick up these costs.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK, Uber lost a landmark employment tribunal that could affect the status of its 30,000 drivers in the country. In their ruling on the case, brought by two Uber drivers, the tribunal judges turned to Hamlet to criticise Uber for \u201cgrimly\u201d sticking to \u201cfaintly ridiculous\u201d arguments that it is an app and not a taxi service. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/10/28/uber-awaits-major-tribunal-decision-over-drivers-working-rights/\">The lady doth protest too much, methinks</a>,\u201d it said. Uber is appealing the ruling.</p> <p>It says it is revising its contracts in plainer English and that \u201cwe\u2019ve always been clear to drivers who use Uber that they are self-employed and free to choose if, when and where they drive, with no shifts, minimum hours or uniforms\u201d.</p> <p>As a courier back in New York, if it\u2019s going to rain tomorrow, I won\u2019t find out from the Weather Channel, but from Uber. Rain, snow or particularly cold weather means more profit for the company as demand increases, and it responds with price surges. It also means the potential for more earnings for the more than 1 million Uber drivers and cyclists around the world. (The cyclist option is currently only available in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto and Portland.)</p> <p>\u201cRain is forecast tomorrow and it will be one of the busiest days of the year so far!\u201d reads a text from Uber. \u201cWe are offering a $25 incentive for completing at least five trips throughout the day tomorrow \u2026 This is a HUGE opportunity to earn money so don\u2019t miss out.\u201d</p> <p>I fire up the app at lunchtime and wait for jobs to come pouring in. Soon my phone pings and a countdown begins, giving me 10 seconds to decide whether to accept a job. I accept and rush for the elevator, fearing any delay could jeopardise my five-star rating. </p> <p>Uber drivers and couriers are rated by each customer, and the company warns that any delays, breakages or perceived rudeness are likely to lead to poor ratings. Couriers and drivers also rate the customers. I give all my customers five stars except Nicholas, whom I give one star out of petulance at his laziness. </p> <p>This job is to collect a \u201cBuckaroo\u201d burger (beef, aged cheddar, brisket, wild mushroom and smoke sauce on a brioche bun) and fries from the trendy organic chain Bareburger in the Financial District and take it to a university lecturer 0.66 miles away. The delivery takes six minutes, earning me $4. Not bad, but the time it takes to collect goods is unpaid, as is the trip back to the starting point. The jobs aren\u2019t rolling in either, even though I am in one of Uber\u2019s designated busy zones in the financial heart of the city, where it has boosted fares by 1.4 times this lunchtime.</p> <p>The downtime is OK for me because I\u2019m fitting delivery around my day job writing articles, like this one, but for people turning full-time to gig economy jobs, excessive periods of downtime can make earning a consistent living precarious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0bf9d25837014d51b148780db9866c622ed34dcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bf9d25837014d51b148780db9866c622ed34dcb/0_173_750_937/400.jpg\" alt=\"Uber price surges.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uber price surges.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rupert Neate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just two more jobs come in that day \u2013 delivering a falafel sandwich to a tech bro working alone in a huge empty office at the tip of Manhattan with views of the Statue of Liberty ($4.12, plus a $2 tip \u2013 thanks, man), and dispatching a letter from a downtown WeWork coworking space to Gillian at another WeWork in the West Village ($12.10) \u2013 so I fail to secure the $25 incentive.</p> <p>My luck appears to be looking up the next day as my phone pings at 10.31am, sending me to Cafe Patoro, a Brazilian bakery famous for its <em tabindex=\"-1\">p\u00e3o de queijo</em> (cheese-flavoured tapioca rolls). I am at the downtown cafe to pick up a half <em tabindex=\"-1\">brigadeiro</em> cake (a condensed milk and chocolate truffle, a national icon in Brazil since it was invented during the second world war, when it was difficult to source fresh milk). </p> <p>The cake is for Roberta Freitas, a Brazilian banker working on Lexington Avenue in Midtown who has ordered it for an office holiday party, where the multicultural team have been asked to each bring a delicacy from their home country. I set off cycling up the East River bike path, but soon realise Freitas\u2019s cake won\u2019t survive the journey in my satchel. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-money-blog/2016/jun/09/universal-basic-income-gig-economy-technology\">How the gig economy is helping make the case for universal basic income</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Worried that I could ruin her office party and my five-star Uber rating, I lock my bike and take the subway uptown. A very smiley Freitas collects her cake, and I take the subway back downtown, only to find a very lonely lamppost where my bike was. </p> <p>My bike is not insured by Uber. When I eventually get hold of a human at Uber, I am told the only insurance cover is up to $1m to cover \u201cbodily injury or property damage to third parties where the claim arises out of UberEats and UberRush operations\u201d. Note it only pays out if I injure a third party; if an Uber cyclist gets knocked down by a cab, he or she will have to pay for his or her own ambulance/hearse. Freitas\u2019s cake doesn\u2019t appear to be insured, either. A spokeswoman says: \u201cIn terms of your question about dropping cupcakes (or breaking something during a delivery), this is something we examine on a case-by-case basis.\u201d</p> <p>A very short-lived cycle courier career over before it\u2019s properly begun, you might think.

      "bodyText": "With a combination of the US attack on Syria and much weaker than expected jobs numbers for March, it is no surprise that Wall Street has got off to a cautious start. But there is no real panic selling, and after an initial dip the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now just about in positive territory, up 5 points or 0.03% . The S&amp;P 500 opened down a mere 0.09% and the Nasdaq Composite is marginally ahead. In Europe Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.3% and France\u2019s Cac 0.1%. The FTSE 100 has added 0.3%, helped by a good performance from Randgold Resources as the gold price climbs. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. US markets look like they may well shrug off the disappointing jobs figures: Back with Greece and after eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem confirmed their had been discussions with the International Monetary Fund this week, comes a reasonably upbeat statement from that very organisation. IMF spokesperson Gerry Rice said: There has been important progress in recent weeks. A number of policy issues remain outstanding. But we are at a point where we think there are good prospects for successfully concluding discussions on these outstanding policy issues during the next mission to Athens. Such an agreement on policies will have to be followed by discussions with euro area countries to ensure satisfactory assurances on a credible strategy to restore debt sustainability, before a program is presented to the IMF Executive Board. Here\u2019s our report on the disappointing jobs figures: The US economy added just 98,000 jobs in March as a cold snap, a government hiring freeze and a faltering retail sector appear to have put the chill on president Donald Trump\u2019s promise to boost hiring. The jobs market had got off to a flying start in 2017, adding an average of 236,500 jobs a month. February\u2019s jobs report was the first under Donald Trump and was seized upon by the president as evidence that his promise to bring back US manufacturing jobs was coming true. Economists had been expecting the economy to add 180,000 jobs in March but a combination of factors appear to have stalled the growth in the jobs market. March saw snow storms sweep across much of the eastern seaboard which may have slowed hiring. And in late January Trump ordered a civilian government hiring freeze, calling for no vacant federal positions to be filled and none to be created until his budget director has drawn up a long-term cost-cutting plan. That decision will only now be filtering into the jobs figures. Retailers lost 30,000 jobs in March as many of its biggest names announced plans to shut stores in the face of online competition. In the past several months, Macy\u2019s has announced it will close 63 stores; Sears, 150; The Limited, 250; BCBG Max Azria, 120; Guess, 60; American Apparel, 104; Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, 60; JCPenney, up to 140. There was some good news. The unemployment rate declined to 4.5% and average hourly earnings rose 2.7%, or 68 cents, from a year earlier. The full story is here: The non-farms report does not really give a clear message on the state of the US economy, says James Knightley at ING Bank: The headline from the US jobs report is the big miss on payrolls, which rose only 98,000 versus expectations of a 180,000 rise. We had been looking for a soft figure, but certainly not this poor. We reasoned that unseasonably warm weather had helped boost construction activity and jobs in January and February (when building sites often typically shut down), so we wouldn\u2019t get the usual bounce in March and this does appear to have happened \u2013 construction jobs rose 34k in Jan and 58k in Feb, but only 6k in March. However, there was some real disappointment in retail trade, which saw employment fall 30k after a 31k drop in February while transport services also saw two consecutive monthly falls (-27k in March after -16k in February). This seems to tally somewhat with weaker consumer spending data and is something worth watching. On the other side of the equation, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.5% (lowest since 2007) from 4.7%. Using this household survey, employment has risen 920,000 in the past two months so there is a real contradiction with the employment survey, which will only add to the confusion on how to interpret the report. Rounding out the figures, wages rose 0.2%/2.7%, which was in line with market expectations. Unfortunately, given the lack of a clear message from this report it is difficult to come up with a simple conclusion. For now we are forecasting just one additional Fed rate rise this year, but consumer spending will be a key story to watch. Spending growth has been fairly soft recently, which may be the result of households starting to feel a squeeze on spending power now that the cost of living (CPI at 2.7%YoY) is increasing at the same rate as wage growth. Weak spending growth is also consistent with the poor retail jobs numbers within the report. Nonetheless, consumers are upbeat with sentiment close to cycle highs. This is likely to be down to the healthy jobs market, but could also be partially due to President Trump\u2019s promises of \u201cmassive\u201d tax cuts. If tax cuts are delayed or watered down by Congress then we may see sentiment drop back. In an environment where consumer spending is looking a little vulnerable the market may consider scaling back its expectations for Fed policy tightening \u2013 next week\u2019s retail sales report could be an interesting barometer. Here\u2019s some reaction to the weak US jobs numbers: Kully Samra, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab: While we saw strong results in January and February, boosted by better weather, conversely, March has been impacted negatively by the reverse. However, one slightly disappointing month does not constitute a wholesale change in fortunes. We\u2019ll need to see more hard data before we know whether these numbers are the start of a downward trend away from the strong jobs market or merely a temporary blip on the radar. Investors are facing the realisation that \u201csoft\u201d data\u2014such as confidence readings and business surveys\u2014doesn\u2019t necessarily translate immediately into \u201chard\u201d data\u2014like retail sales, capital expenditures, and industrial production. It\u2019s this hard data that translates into economic growth and increasing profitability. Looking at some of the parabolic moves in recent confidence surveys, it would be difficult for hard data to keep up. US stocks have suffered some downward pressure recently as overly optimistic investor sentiment has boiled off, however, the economy is robust, earnings have picked up, and we expect the bull market in American equities to run for some time. David Morrison, Senior Market Strategist at Spreadco: While March\u2019s NFP consensus expectation has held steady around 175,000, Wednesday\u2019s strong ADP release caused many analysts to revise up their forecasts. It\u2019s fair to say that quite a few traders were looking for job gains of around 200,000 today Unemployment Rate fell to 4.5% and has held at 5% or below for 18 months now \u2013 representing full employment for the longest period since the Financial Crisis. Of course, Average Earnings are key as these are vital in flagging up inflationary pressures and these were steady at +0.2% month-on-month. There is also the worry that fiscal stimulus may take longer to come through than is currently priced in to markets. If the Trump administration finds it is unable to push through tax cuts, regulatory reform and infrastructure spending this year, then we could see a significant pull-back in equity prices. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: With interest rates hiked last month, and President Trump\u2019s pledges to put jobs at the heart of his presidency, March\u2019s drop in non-farm payroll will bring both surprise and concern, especially with price growth on the rise. Uninterrupted jobs growth since last August, combined with rising inflation and accelerating wages, contributed to the rate increase at the most recent Fed meeting. The Fed has forecast two more rises in 2017, and while this will please savers, Trump will likely have to deal with the political fallout as consumers begin to feel the pinch. Naeem Aslam, Chief Market Analyst at Think Markets UK: The US NFP data has confirmed that February\u2019s blowout number was an anomaly since many were arguing that the rise is chiefly caused by mild weather conditions. Consumer spending is the cornerstone of the US economy, and we know that so far this quarter, this number has been in a massive trouble. If we want to see robust GDP growth, we need this number to bounce back strongly and the only way that we can see this happening, is mainly due to higher wage growths. The 98,000 jobs added in March was the lowest figure for ten months, with the retail sector shedding workers for the second month in a row. But the unemployment rate fell form 4.7% to 4.5%, said the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the lowest level since May 2007. The January and February figures, although revised down, were still above 200,000 and benefitted from warmer weather leading to employment growth in areas like construction and leisure. But falling temperatures and storms in March seem to have hit the hiring rate. President Trump may be putting a lot of emphasis on job creation, but the widely watched non-farm payroll figures for March have come in much lower than expected. In all 98,000 jobs were added last month, well down on the forecast 180,000. And February\u2019s figure was revised down from 235,000 to 219.000 while January was cut from the initial 238,000 to 216,000. Back with the UK, and the National Institute for Economic and Social Research says weak retail sales hit GDP growth in the first quarter. Its monthly estimates of GDP show output grew by 0.5% in the three months to the end of March, unchanged from the three months to February. In the final quarter of 2016, growth was 0.6%. NIESR\u2019s James Warren said: We estimate growth slowed slightly in the first quarter of 2017 to 0.5 per cent. A key component of this moderation has been relatively weak retail sales in the first two months of this year. Consumption is expected to moderate further this year as increasing inflation erodes households\u2019 purchasing power. We expect the Bank of England to look through this temporary shock to inflation and for monetary policy to remain accommodative. Earlier came weak UK industrial production, manufacturing output and trade figures. Over in Athens protestors aligned with the communist party workers\u2019 union, Pame, are already gearing up for action announcing mass protests nationwide, writes Helena Smith. The labour organisation has called on workers nationwide to take to the streets. A mass demonstration will be held outside the Greek parliament later this afternoon with some protests also taking place on far-flung Aegean islands such as Ikaria tomorrow. \u201cThe government has agreed to further butcher the labour and social security rights of workers,\u201d Pame said in a statement adding that the new measures had been drafted in cahoots with industrialists, the European Union and hated International Monetary Fund. And more from Dijsselbloem following the meeting: And here\u2019s the eurogroup statement on Greece: The Eurogroup was briefed on developments in the intense talks between the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Stability Mechanism and the Greek government over the past month. The institutions and the Greek authorities reached an agreement on the main elements of policy reforms required to move ahead with the second review of the current macroeconomic adjustment programme, which is necessary to unlock further financial assistance to Greece. This agreement refers to the size, timing and sequencing of the reforms. The Institutions will continue technical work in Athens as soon as possible to swiftly conclude a staff level agreement. Senior officials in Athens are saying whatever deal was agreed at the eurogroup meeting in Malta today, agreement must now be put to the Greek parliament for a vote \u2026 which is where things may get testy. Helena Smith reports: The Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and prime minister Alexis Tsipras will now need all their persuasive powers to ram whatever measures have been agreed with creditors through parliament. In recent weeks, leading figures in Syriza, the governing left-wing party, have voiced deep disgruntlement over the concessions Tsakalotos has had to make to wrap up the compliance review at the heart of Athens\u2019 latest standoff with creditors. Tsakalotos, addressing reporters in Malta, was quick to give a hint of the disquiet that lies ahead saying: \u201cThere are things that will upset the Greek people.\u201d Speaking to the Guardian, the Interior Minister, Panos Skourletis, an outspoken critic of the austerity Greece has had to accept in exchange for emergency bailout funding, said much would depend on the \u201cfinal picture\u201d that emerged. The measures, he said, would likely be put to parliament (in the form of emergency legislation) after Easter. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is possible that they will be brought to parliament before Easter because it closes next Wednesday,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe devil is in the detail. We don\u2019t have a final picture yet \u2026 ideologically all of us in Syriza have disagreed with these policies, measures that only stoke recession, since the great compromise our government was forced to make in the summer of 2015.\u201d The eurogroup press conference is over, but Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos is now speaking: Despite the optimism Dijsselbloem warned time was still running out: The situation in Greece is not improving, it is all our faults, we are taking too long, the momentum is slipping away. We need to get it done well in time for the next Greek payment. Jeroen Dijsselbloem is asked whether the International Monetary Fund, which has been reluctant to join further bailouts without debt relief, agrees with this result. He says there have been talks with the IMF and he couldn\u2019t have made this announcement without agreement. On the return of the inspectors, he said now the main agreements have been reached, it was just a practical question as to when they return: There is nothing withholding the mission going back, we have solved all the big issues. It is very important they go back. Comments on Greece at the eurogroup press conference from European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici: And the European Central Bank\u2019s Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9: (DSA is the debt sustainability analysis.) An agreement between Greece and its creditors on overarching reforms has been reached. Further work will continue in the coming days and inspectors will return to Athens as soon as possible, according to eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Dijsselbloem says the \u201cbig blocks\u201d have been sorted out. The eurogroup press conference will be transmitted live here when it starts. Well, that was quick: Here\u2019s our full story on Carney\u2019s speech: The Bank of England governor has made an impassioned plea for politicians not to give into protectionism on banking rules when negotiating Britain\u2019s exit from the EU but to keep an open financial system. A week after prime minister Theresa May triggered article 50, formally beginning the process of the UK withdrawing from the EU, Mark Carney used a speech on the financial system to challenge those who want to cut the UK\u2019s access to the rest of Europe after Brexit. Highlighting what he believes is at stake if Brexit results in the City being cut off from the rest of Europe, Carney sought to portray London as a key part of the global financial system and reiterated his earlier claim that \u201cLondon is Europe\u2019s investment banker\u201d. He said that repair work to the financial system since the global crisis had made it safer, simpler and fairer and that the UK had gone beyond the minimum global standards, meaning others could others could rely on it as a \u201cpillar of strength for the international monetary and financial system\u201d. But describing Brexit negotiations as a \u201clitmus test for responsible financial globalisation\u201d, Carney suggested such gains were now at risk. \u201cA decade of hard fought financial reform creates enormous opportunities,\u201d Carney said in a speech in London\u2019s Canary Wharf financial district on Friday. \u201cIt is all too easy to give into protectionism, but the road less taken is often the most rewarding.\u201d There is question and answer session with Carney so there may well be questions about the morning\u2019s weak UK data and its impact on interest rate policy. The UK figures point to a slowdown in GDP growth, says Howard Archer of IHS Markit: A disappointing package of data for the UK economy which fuels suspicion that GDP growth slowed markedly, largely due to consumers becoming more cautious. We suspect UK GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017 slowed to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter from 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016 \u2013 this would be the weakest growth rate since the first quarter of 2016. Industrial production and (especially) construction output fell back appreciably in February while the trade deficit widened, admittedly partly due to erratic items lifting imports. There was some limited, much needed relief on the prices front as prices of imported traded goods dipped 0.9% month-on-month in February as sterling was modestly firmer and oil and commodity prices came off their highs. Even so, import prices were up 9.9% year-on-year. Britain\u2019s unseasonably warm weather in February is being partly blamed for the fall in industrial production. The Office for National Statistics said: The monthly decrease in electricity and gas was largely due to falls in both electricity generation and in the supply and distribution of gas and gaseous fuels; this was largely attributable to the temperature in February 2017 being 1.6 degrees Celsius warmer than average. Here\u2019s Reuters on the UK data: British industrial output fell unexpectedly in February and manufacturers struggled, according to official data on Friday that added to signs economic growth may have slowed as Britain prepares to leave the EU. Industrial output fell 0.7 percent in February, worse than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that pointed to a 0.2 percent increase and following a 0.3 percent decline in January. Separate figures showed Britain\u2019s goods trade deficit unexpectedly hit a five-month high in February and January\u2019s deficit was revised up too, the Office for National Statistics said. Another batch of figures showing a slump in construction output chimed with recent business surveys that suggested Britain\u2019s economic performance probably peaked towards the end of last year. The latest ONS data suggested manufacturing was not making up for signs of a consumer spending slowdown as some economists had hoped following the pound\u2019s post-Brexit vote drop. Output in manufacturing, which accounts for about 10 percent of Britain\u2019s gross domestic product, unexpectedly fell 0.1 percent following a 1.0 percent fall in January, disappointing against forecasts for a 0.3 percent rise in the Reuters poll. There are also some poor UK construction figures, with output falling 1.7% month on month in February, the biggest drop in almost a year. Year on year, construction output rose just 0.5% compared to expectations of a 1.9% increase. Here\u2019s how the trade gap is widening, with the goods deficit unexpectedly hitting a five month high: Sterling has fallen back after the weak UK data, with the prospect of a change to the Bank of England\u2019s current low interest rate policy receding. The pound fell to $1.2429 against the dollar before recovering slightly to $1.2438, down 0.22%. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group said: UK\u2019s manufacturing and industrial production unexpectedly contracted for the second month in a row. Soft data revived the Bank of England doves and backed the idea that the inflation alone may not be a sufficient reason to raise the interest rates in the UK. BREAKING NEWS: Some disappointing numbers from the UK, with industrial production surprisingly falling by 0.7% month on month in February compared to expectations of a 0.2% increase and a 0.4% decline in January. The year on year rise was 2.8%, lower than the forecast 3.7%. Manufacturing output was also lower, down 0.1% month on month compared to forecasts of a 0.3% rise. And the trade deficit is the widest since September 2016, with the global goods trade balance coming in at -\u00a312.461bn. Economists had been expecting a figure of -\u00a310.9bn. The Office for National Statistics said gold and aircraft erratic item imports pushed up the overall deficit. So far, and despite Russia saying the US air strike on Syria soured relations between the two superpowers, markets remain calm. The FTSE 100 is virtually flat, down just 0.08% while most European markets are lower but not too dramatically so. And the US market seems to be shrugging off the conflict as well, to judge by the futures market: Signs of a slowdown in the UK housing market. UK house prices in the three months to March were 3.8% higher than a year ago, according to the Halifax, although this was down from the 5.1% figure recorded in February and was the lowest rate since May 2013. Prices were just 0.1% higher in March compared to the previous month, the lowest rate of change since October 2016. Martin Ellis, Halifax housing economist, said: The annual rate of house price growth has more than halved over the past 12 months. A lengthy period of rapid house price growth has made it increasingly difficult for many to purchase a home as income growth has failed to keep up, which appears to have curbed housing demand. Nonetheless, the supply of both new homes and existing properties available for sale remains low. This, together with historically very low mortgage rates, is likely to support house price levels over the coming months. Howard Archer at IHS Markit said: March\u2019s flat Halifax house price data - following on from lower Nationwide data and the Bank of England reporting a dip in mortgage approvals in February - fuels our belief that the housing market is being increasingly affected by the increasing squeeze on consumers and their concerns over the outlook. Markedly weakening consumer fundamentals, likely mounting caution over making major spending decisions, and elevated house price to earnings ratios are likely to weigh down on housing market activity and house prices. However, a shortage of supply is likely to put a floor under prices. Consequently, we believe house price gains over 2017 will be limited to no more than 2.5% - and there is a very real possibility that it could come in lower than that. Let\u2019s not forget that President Trump is also occupied with meeting his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. According to Xinhau News Xi has said he is ready to work with Trump to boost China-US ties. As the eurogroup of finance ministers meet to discuss Greece, there seem to be some hopeful signs that an agreement could be on its way. Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem has said ahead of the meeting that it has achieved results on Greece although there will not be a total political deal today. Although there is always at least one contrarian: As expected the uncertainty triggered by the US air strikes on Syria has sent European markets lower, but there is by no means panic. The FTSE 100 is currently down just 5 points or 0.06% .while France\u2019s Cac, Germany\u2019s Dax and Spain\u2019s Ibex opened 0.4% lower. The US may be in the headlines at the moment for the attack on Syria, but as mentioned previously, there is some key economic data out later in the form of the latest jobs figures. Analysts are expecting US non-farm payrolls to show a rise of 185,000, a drop from February\u2019s 235,000. But there is a chance the figure could be much higher, to judge from this week\u2019s private sector jobs data from ADP. That report showed a better than expected 263,000 number, and while the correlation with non-farms is not consistent, it could mean there could yet be a surprise on the cards. CMC\u2019s Hewson again: Over the last few months there hasn\u2019t been much more than a 50,000 gap between the two since October last year, which suggests that we\u2019ll likely see a fairly strong number above 200,000, maybe in the region of 230,000. The wages figure will also be widely watched, since that is an important element in the Federal Reserve\u2019s thinking when it comes to interest rate decisions. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump\u2019s decision to authorise airstrikes on Syria after this week\u2019s chemical attack has understandably spooked markets. With growing tensions between the US and China over North Korea after the country launched another missile this week, signs that the US could also be at odds with Russia over Syria has added to the unease. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: Today\u2019s military action against Syrian airfields after this week\u2019s chemical gas attack, shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise after Secretary of State Tillerson\u2019s remarks that recent events required a \u201cserious response\u201d however the timing was, coming so quickly afterwards. The action adds a complexity to geopolitics that wasn\u2019t there before given Russia\u2019s support for Syria and Trumps pre-election pledges to try and repair relations with Putin. The US would now appear to be on a collision course with Russia as Tillerson went on to add that there was no prospect that Assad could remain Syria\u2019s leader in light of the use of chemical weapons, and markets in Europe are likely to reflect this escalation in tensions with a lower open and higher gold prices as safe haven assets attract capital flows. Gold added more than 1% to $1264 an ounce, its highest level since November, while Brent crude jumped 2% to a one month high on concerns that growing military action could hit supplies. But with the US suggesting the Syria move was a one off, some of the early knee-jerk reaction has abated, and Brent is currently 1% higher at $55.54 a barrel. Japan\u2019s Nikkei reversed its initial losses to close up 0.4%, while European markets are expected to open only slightly lower.

We had been looking for a soft figure, but certainly not this poor. We reasoned that unseasonably warm weather had helped boost construction activity and jobs in January and February (when building sites often typically shut down), so we wouldn\u2019t get the usual bounce in March and this does appear to have happened \u2013 construction jobs rose 34k in Jan and 58k in Feb, but only 6k in March.</p> <p>However, there was some real disappointment in retail trade, which saw employment fall 30k after a 31k drop in February while transport services also saw two consecutive monthly falls (-27k in March after -16k in February). This seems to tally somewhat with weaker consumer spending data and is something worth watching.</p> <p>On the other side of the equation, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.5% (lowest since 2007) from 4.7%. Using this household survey, employment has risen 920,000 in the past two months so there is a real contradiction with the employment survey, which will only add to the confusion on how to interpret the report. Rounding out the figures, wages rose 0.2%/2.7%, which was in line with market expectations. Unfortunately, given the lack of a clear message from this report it is difficult to come up with a simple conclusion.</p> <p>For now we are forecasting just one additional Fed rate rise this year, but consumer spending will be a key story to watch. Spending growth has been fairly soft recently, which may be the result of households starting to feel a squeeze on spending power now that the cost of living (CPI at 2.7%YoY) is increasing at the same rate as wage growth. Weak spending growth is also consistent with the poor retail jobs numbers within the report. Nonetheless, consumers are upbeat with sentiment close to cycle highs.</p> <p>This is likely to be down to the healthy jobs market, but could also be partially due to President Trump\u2019s promises of \u201cmassive\u201d tax cuts. If tax cuts are delayed or watered down by Congress then we may see sentiment drop back. In an environment where consumer spending is looking a little vulnerable the market may consider scaling back its expectations for Fed policy tightening \u2013 next week\u2019s retail sales report could be an interesting barometer.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58e78a31e4b0e0ec04efeac9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-07T12:52:04.378Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s some reaction to the weak US jobs numbers:</p> <h2><strong>Kully Samra, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab: </strong></h2> <p> While we saw strong results in January and February, boosted by better weather, conversely, March has been impacted negatively by the reverse. However, one slightly disappointing month does not constitute a wholesale change in fortunes. We\u2019ll need to see more hard data before we know whether these numbers are the start of a downward trend away from the strong jobs market or merely a temporary blip on the radar.</p> <p>Investors are facing the realisation that \u201csoft\u201d data\u2014such as confidence readings and business surveys\u2014doesn\u2019t necessarily translate immediately into \u201chard\u201d data\u2014like retail sales, capital expenditures, and industrial production. It\u2019s this hard data that translates into economic growth and increasing profitability. Looking at some of the parabolic moves in recent confidence surveys, it would be difficult for hard data to keep up.</p> <p>US stocks have suffered some downward pressure recently as overly optimistic investor sentiment has boiled off, however, the economy is robust, earnings have picked up, and we expect the bull market in American equities to run for some time.</p> <h2><strong>David Morrison, </strong>Senior Market Strategist at Spreadco:</h2> <p>While March\u2019s NFP consensus expectation has held steady around 175,000, Wednesday\u2019s strong ADP release caused many analysts to revise up their forecasts. It\u2019s fair to say that quite a few traders were looking for job gains of around 200,000 today</p> <p>Unemployment Rate fell to 4.5% and has held at 5% or below for 18 months now \u2013 representing full employment for the longest period since the Financial Crisis.</p> <p>Of course, Average Earnings are key as these are vital in flagging up inflationary pressures and these were steady at +0.2% month-on-month.</p> <p>There is also the worry that fiscal stimulus may take longer to come through than is currently priced in to markets. If the Trump administration finds it is unable to push through tax cuts, regulatory reform and infrastructure spending this year, then we could see a significant pull-back in equity prices.</p> <h2>Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com:</h2> <p>With interest rates hiked last month, and President Trump\u2019s pledges to put jobs at the heart of his presidency, March\u2019s drop in non-farm payroll will bring both surprise and concern, especially with price growth on the rise.</p> <p>Uninterrupted jobs growth since last August, combined with rising inflation and accelerating wages, contributed to the rate increase at the most recent Fed meeting.</p> <p>The Fed has forecast two more rises in 2017, and while this will please savers, Trump will likely have to deal with the political fallout as consumers begin to feel the pinch.</p> <h2><strong>Naeem Aslam, </strong><strong>Chief Market Analyst at </strong><strong>Think Markets UK:</strong></h2> <p>The US NFP data has confirmed that February\u2019s blowout number was an anomaly since many were arguing that the rise is chiefly caused by mild weather conditions. Consumer spending is the cornerstone of the US economy, and we know that so far this quarter, this number has been in a massive trouble. If we want to see robust GDP growth, we need this number to bounce back strongly and the only way that we can see this happening, is mainly due to higher wage growths. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58e78857e4b05776df18b7d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-07T12:44:53.701Z\">1.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The 98,000 jobs added in March was the lowest figure for ten months, with the retail sector shedding workers for the second month in a row.</p> <p>But the unemployment rate fell form 4.7% to 4.5%, said <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ces/#news\">the Bureau of Labor Statistics,</a> the lowest level since May 2007.</p> <p>The January and February figures, although revised down, were still above 200,000 and benefitted from warmer weather leading to employment growth in areas like construction and leisure.

But there is a chance the figure could be much higher, to judge from this week\u2019s private sector jobs data from ADP. That report showed a better than expected 263,000 number, and while the correlation with non-farms is not consistent, it could mean there could yet be a surprise on the cards.

With growing tensions between the US and China over North Korea after the country launched another missile this week, signs that the US could also be at odds with Russia over Syria has added to the unease. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s military action against Syrian airfields after this week\u2019s chemical gas attack, shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise after Secretary of State Tillerson\u2019s remarks that recent events required a \u201cserious response\u201d however the timing was, coming so quickly afterwards. The action adds a complexity to geopolitics that wasn\u2019t there before given Russia\u2019s support for Syria and Trumps pre-election pledges to try and repair relations with Putin. </p> <p>The US would now appear to be on a collision course with Russia as Tillerson went on to add that there was no prospect that Assad could remain Syria\u2019s leader in light of the use of chemical weapons, and markets in Europe are likely to reflect this escalation in tensions with a lower open and higher gold prices as safe haven assets attract capital flows.</p> </blockquote> <p>Gold added more than 1% to $1264 an ounce, its highest level since November, while Brent crude jumped 2% to a one month high on concerns that growing military action could hit supplies.</p> <p>But with the US suggesting the Syria move was a one off, some of the early knee-jerk reaction has abated, and Brent is currently 1% higher at $55.54 a barrel. Japan\u2019s Nikkei reversed its initial losses to close up 0.4%, while European markets are expected to open only slightly lower. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/850221548547973122\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our European opening calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTSE&amp;src=ctag\">$FTSE</a> 7290 down 14<br>$DAX\u00a012194 down 37<br>$CAC\u00a05110 down 11<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBEX&amp;src=ctag\">$IBEX</a> 10499 down 20<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MIB&amp;src=ctag\">$MIB</a> 20246 down 51</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/850221548547973122\">April 7, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>You can follow the latest developments in our live blog here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/apr/07/us-syria-response-donald-trump-assad-pentagon-live\">Donald Trump launches US missile strike against Syria after chemical attack \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere the week is ending with a burst of activity.</p> <p>On the agenda are UK industrial production and trade figures, the latest Halifax house price index, a speech by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on financial services, US non-farm payrolls, not to mention a Eurogroup meeting on, among other things, the latest attempts to resolve the Greek debt crisis.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "The US economy added just 98,000 jobs in March as a cold snap, a government hiring freeze and a faltering retail sector appear to have put the chill on Donald Trump\u2019s promise to boost hiring. The jobs market had got off to a flying start in 2017, adding an average of 236,500 jobs a month. February\u2019s jobs report was the first under Trump and was seized upon by the president as evidence that his promise to bring back US manufacturing jobs was coming true. Only two days ago the president took to Twitter to post: \u201cJOBS, JOBS, JOBS!\u201d and list the hiring decisions of major US firms since his election. Economists had been expecting the economy to add 180,000 jobs in March but a combination of factors appear to have stalled the growth in the jobs market. March saw snowstorms sweep across much of the eastern seaboard, which may have slowed hiring. Construction jobs rose by 6,000 in March, down from a gain of 59,000 in February. And in late January, Trump ordered a civilian government hiring freeze, calling for no vacant federal positions to be filled and none to be created until his budget director has drawn up a long-term cost-cutting plan. That decision will only now be filtering into the jobs figures. Retailers lost 30,000 jobs in March as many of its biggest names announced plans to shut stores in the face of online competition. In the past several months, Macy\u2019s has announced it will close 63 stores; Sears, 150; The Limited, 250; BCBG Max Azria, 120; Guess, 60; American Apparel, 104; Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, 60; JCPenney, up to 140. There was some good news. The unemployment rate declined to 4.5%, the lowest rate in a decade, and average hourly earnings rose 2.7%, or 68 cents, from a year earlier. But the numbers came as a shock to Wall Street, where investors were already rattled by Trump\u2019s airstrikes in Syria. Marcus Bullus, trading director at MB Capital, said: \u201cThe March non-farm payrolls number was a phenomenal miss and will add to market uncertainty following the Syria missile strikes. Very few traders saw this one coming.\u201d But other economists warned not to read too much into one month\u2019s figures. \u201cAlthough job growth slowed in March, and was much weaker than expected, the labor market remains in good shape. Job growth this year is running close to last year\u2019s pace, and is running well ahead of what is needed to keep up with labor force growth,\u201d said PNC chief economist Gus Faucher. The government figures came a day after ADP, the US\u2019s largest private payroll company, released its latest monthly survey. Private companies added 263,000 jobs in March, according to the report compiled by ADP and Moody\u2019s Analytics, far higher than the 185,000 analysts had been expecting. Most of the growth was in small businesses, which added 118,000 jobs. Goods-producing industries, including construction and manufacturing, added 82,000 jobs. \u201cJob growth is off to a strong start in 2017,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, said in a statement. \u201cThe gains are broad-based but most notable in the goods producing side of the economy including construction, manufacturing and mining.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has given financial firms a deadline of 14 July to explain how they are planning for the UK\u2019s departure from the EU and warned them to be ready for all possible outcomes, including a hard Brexit. The Bank wrote to hundreds of banks, insurers and other financial firms on Friday ordering them to get contingency plans in place. The move follows prime minister Theresa May\u2019s triggering of article 50 last week, formally launching the Brexit process. Bank governor Mark Carney said central banks and financial firms should be planning for \u201call eventualities\u201d as he used a speech in London to call for an open financial system between the UK and the EU post-Brexit (pdf). A key concern for financial firms is whether the UK will still hold the passporting rights that allow British-based banks and insurers to do business with the rest of the EU after Brexit. Some companies have already unveiled plans to move jobs and operations out of the UK and the Bank is now calling on all those with cross-border activities between the UK and the rest of the EU to report back by 14 July. Sam Woods, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor for prudential regulation and head of the Prudential Regulation Authority, wrote in Friday\u2019s letter: \u201cMany firms are well-advanced in their planning and have engaged closely with the PRA as part of that process. However, our current assessment is that the level of planning is uneven across firms and plans may not be being sufficiently tested against the most adverse potential outcomes.\u201d Carney said the main purpose of the letter was to ensure \u201call firms are making, and stand ready to execute in good time should the need arise, contingency plans for the full range of possible scenarios\u201d. As the UK and EU governments prepare for tough Brexit negotiations, Carney used his speech to challenge those who want to cut the UK\u2019s access to the rest of Europe. He urged politicians not to give in to protectionism on banking rules but to keep an open financial system. Highlighting what he believes is at stake if Brexit results in the City being cut off from the rest of Europe, Carney sought to portray London as a key part of the global financial system and reiterated his earlier claim that \u201cLondon is Europe\u2019s investment banker\u201d. He said that repair work to the financial system since the global crisis had made it safer, simpler and fairer and that the UK had gone beyond the minimum global standards, meaning others could rely on it as a \u201cpillar of strength for the international monetary and financial system\u201d. But, describing Brexit negotiations as a \u201clitmus test for responsible financial globalisation\u201d, Carney suggested such gains were now at risk. \u201cA decade of hard fought financial reform creates enormous opportunities,\u201d Carney said in a speech at Thomson Reuters in London\u2019s Canary Wharf on Friday. \u201cIt is all too easy to give into protectionism, but the road less taken is often the most rewarding.\u201d He made his case for an open financial system by describing a high road and a low road. \u201cWe are at a fork in the road,\u201d Carney said. \u201cOne path builds on the foundations of a new responsible global financial system that are being put in place \u2026 The high road leads to more jobs, higher sustainable growth, and better risk management across the G20,\u201d he added, referring to the G20 group of mainly rich nations. \u201cBut there is another path \u2013 the low road \u2013 where trust and cooperation diminish, fragmentation hardens, capital flows are disrupted, and trade and innovation are curtailed.\u201d The low road would be \u201csub-optimal for all, with fewer jobs, lower growth and higher domestic risks\u201d, he added. Carney has previously warned that European economies could be damaged if their access to the City of London was disrupted after Britain leaves the EU. On Friday, he reiterated that more than half the equity and debt raised for European governments and business was raised in the UK. Carney called for the EU and UK to agree on rules to ensure money can continue to flow easily between countries, but he said he was not demanding a deal for financial services that was separate from a wider trade deal. \u201cWe fully recognise that the negotiations around financial services are one sliver, albeit an important sliver, but a sliver of a much wider set of discussions that the UK and the EU have just embarked upon,\u201d he said. Carney described the EU and UK as already \u201cideally positioned to create an effective system of deference to each other\u2019s comparable regulatory outcomes, supported by commitments to common minimum standards and open supervisory cooperation\u201d. Worries about a hard Brexit that leaves UK-based financial firms with little access to the EU have forced many companies to unveil plans to move jobs out of London. That in turn has prompted warnings about a blow to tax revenues for the exchequer and to the UK\u2019s economic growth prospects. The insurers Lloyd\u2019s of London and Royal London are setting up subsidiaries outside the UK, while the investment banks JP Morgan and Citigroup are actively exploring the relocation of key operations. Goldman Sachs is to move hundreds of bankers to Frankfurt and Paris, while HSBC could switch 1,000 investment banking jobs from London to Paris.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Competition and Markets Authority is examining payments between housebuilders and the providers of warranties for new homes as part of a review of NHBC, the largest warranty provider. The CMA announced last month it was reviewing undertakings made by NHBC, the standard-setting body for new-build properties in the UK and the main warranty provider. These 22-year-old undertakings were designed to improve competition in the warranty market. The review was announced amid concerns that NHBC is compromising its independence by paying millions of pounds to developers every year. However, the CMA said it was launching the review following a request from NHBC and that it would not consider the \u201cwider issues\u201d relating to the organisation. Nonetheless, the CMA has sent a substantial list of questions about warranties to leading figures in the sector as part of its review. The questions, which have been seen by the Guardian, include asking warranty providers whether they have loyalty or low-claim schemes that compensate builders with a low claim rate and how these payments are calculated. The Guardian revealed this year that NHBC is paying around \u00a310m to \u00a315m every year to housebuilders through what is effectively a profit-share agreement. Campaigners said these payments called into question NHBC\u2019s independence from housebuilders. In response, NHBC said the payments were a \u201cvery small\u201d proportion of its annual turnover and that it was common practice in the insurance industry to recognise good claims history. NHBC said the payments, which it describes as premium refunds, totalled \u00a34.5m last year. NHBC, which claims to have an 80% share of the new-build market, sets quality standards for new homes and provides 10-year warranties to buyers. The warranty is a form of insurance that is supposed to compensate the consumer or fix faults in the new property if there are problems within the first 10 years. However, there has been growing criticism of the quality of new homes in Britain and the lack of protection for consumers. Bovis, one of the UK\u2019s largest housebuilders, was forced to pay out \u00a37m to compensate customers who bought poorly built new homes, while Clarion Housing Group, the country\u2019s largest housing association, has agreed to buy back properties in a London development. A survey published by the House Builders Federation revealed that 98% of customers have reported snags or defects with their home since moving in a year ago, up from 93% last year. Philip Waller, a retired construction manager who runs the campaign website brand-newhomes.co.uk, said: \u201cThe NHBC \u2018premium rebates\u2019 to plc housebuilders and the minimum claim value [for new home buyers], which is currently \u00a31,550, are two areas I believe that require examination and investigation. \u201cI also feel that the historic claims data collected by the NHBC relating to specific individual housebuilders should be made publicly available enabling consumers to make a better-informed buying decision.\u201d The undertakings made by NHBC were that it allowed housebuilders on its register to use other warranty providers and that it did not make changes to its rules that could hurt competition without approval from competition authorities. These are now being reviewed. The CMA declined to comment about the questions sent as part of the review. The NHBC said: \u201cThere have been significant changes in the new home structural warranty market over the last 20 years and NHBC\u2019s view is that its undertakings are now obsolete. So, when approached by the CMA, we welcomed the opportunity to work with them and we asked for the undertakings to be reviewed and released. This reflects our commitment to maintaining an open and competitive market for new home structural warranties. \u201cThe CMA\u2019s review will look at how the market for new home structural warranties currently operates to protect homebuyers in order to see if there has been a change in circumstances which would justify the removal or variation of the undertakings. The CMA has expressly stated that it will not be considering wider issues relating to NHBC as part of this review.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 12 April 2017. The word \u201cinvestigation\u201d was changed to \u201creview\u201d in the first sentence of the fourth paragraph and an additional sentence was added to the end of the fifth paragraph.",

      "bodyText": "Mothercare\u2019s chief executive has said the price of its clothing and toys would increase by 3% to 5% this summer following the decline in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. Mark Newton Jones said the childrenswear and maternity specialist had limited price rises by striking better deals with suppliers, but with half its goods bought in dollars the retailer was not able to absorb higher sourcing costs. \u201cFrom the middle of the year our selling prices will move by 3% to 5% as that inflation flows through,\u201d he said. With a focus on childrenswear Newton-Jones said the price increases would not be material \u2013 for example, adding 40p to the cost of a babygrow. The retailer also stocks a large range of toys, from plastic sandpits to trikes, under its Early Learning Centre brand. Other retailers, including the clothing giant Next, are hiking prices as the weakness of sterling pushes up the cost of imported goods. Next increased the price of its spring and summer ranges by 4% on average and plans to do the same again in the autumn. Newton-Jones\u2019s comments came as the retailer said UK like-for-like sales were up 4.5% in 11 weeks to 25 March, which was better than some analysts expected, sending the shares up more than 3%. International sales were down 1.7% in constant currency as shoppers in the Middle East \u2013 its biggest regional market outside the UK \u2013 spent less because of the slump in oil prices. Newton-Jones was hired in 2014 to lead a turnaround of Mothercare, but confidence was knocked by poor trading last summer. Since taking the helm he has closed loss-making UK outlets and modernised 70% of the remaining 150 stores. \u201cCustomers\u2019 response to our spring/summer ranges has been positive, as has the feedback on the new website and our new store environment,\u201d said Newton-Jones. Sanjay Vidyarthi, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said the management\u2019s recovery strategy looked to be back on track with the UK chain turning a profit over the last six months - its first profitable half year since 2011. \u201cThis is very encouraging, given how difficult and volatile trading conditions have been on the high street, particularly in clothing,\u201d he said.",

With a focus on childrenswear Newton-Jones said the price increases would not be material \u2013 for example, adding 40p to the cost of a babygrow. The retailer also stocks a large range of toys, from plastic sandpits to trikes, under its Early Learning Centre brand.</p> <p>Other retailers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/23/next-price-rises-profits-fall-pound-brexit\">including the clothing giant Next</a>, are hiking prices as the weakness of sterling pushes up the cost of imported goods.

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group\u2019s chairman, Allan Leighton, has insisted the business was making \u201cstellar progress\u201d despite slumping more than \u00a3130m into the red. The mutual revealed its first losses since its tumultuous year in 2013 \u2013 when problems at the Co-operative Bank nearly sank the whole business \u2013 as it wrote down the value of its remaining 20% stake in the bank to nil. Leighton said the \u00a3140m additional writedown of the bank, which had already been written down twice in the past year, was \u201ca piece of prudent accounting\u201d while the bank was being sold by its hedge fund owners. The bank put itself up for sale in February in an attempt to raise more capital and give greater stability to its 4 million customers, four years after it was rescued by hedge funds. Ian Ellis, the finance director, added that the group was still hopeful that a sale of the bank would be successful and it expected \u201cto get some value from the sale\u201d. An update on the sale process is expected by mid-April but could come as early as this week. It has been reported that the bank has plunged in value to as little as \u00a345m. Late last month, the bank said a number of \u201ccredible\u201d potential buyers had expressed an interest. Virgin Money and CYBG, the owner of the Clydesdale and Yorkshire bank networks, are thought to be considering offers. Despite the troubles at the bank, Leighton said the Co-op\u2019s core food stores, funeral homes and insurance businesses had all gained customers and market share under the group\u2019s turnaround plan. \u201cWe have made pretty stellar progress,\u201d he said. Revenues for the group rose by 3% to \u00a39.5bn in the year to 31 December and operating profit rose by 32% to \u00a3148m after lower restructuring costs. Sales at food stores open more than a year increased by 3.5% despite a cut of about 1% in prices over the period. The Co-op Group chief executive, Steve Murrells, who took over from Richard Pennycook last month, said the chain was benefiting from the trend towards shopping little and often in local stores and improvements in its food ranges and stores. He said food prices were now rising by 1.5% to 2%. \u201cThis year is going to be different. We will have to work hard to keep a lid on prices.\u201d Part of the Co-op\u2019s tactics will involve promoting the discounts available via the group\u2019s relaunched membership scheme, which now expects to have 1 million new members by the end of this year, a year earlier than planned. The group\u2019s 5 million members now account for 31% of food sales, up from 20% before the relaunch of the scheme last year. The scheme encourages people to buy Co-op branded goods by offering a 5% discount, boosting sales of more profitable own-label rather than branded items. Tom Berry, an analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201cUK grocers have struggled for years to encourage loyalty among consumers since they are increasingly armed with price comparison tools, but the Co-op\u2019s focus on its core customer has driven loyalty and subsequently like-for-like sales.\u201d Funeral care revenues rose by 3% as the business increased market share for the first time in five years by cutting prices alongside a 69% jump in sales of pre-paid funeral plans. The Co-op\u2019s insurance sales rose 28%, partly due to inflation in motor insurance premiums. Leighton admitted that profits would remain under pressure as the Co-op continued to invest in improving its appeal to customers to ensure long-term growth. \u201cWe are interested in the operating profit in five years, not five months,\u201d he said.",

And, by the way, we\u2019ll wave goodbye to Flora and I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Butter, just like you always wanted. Happy now? Unilever\u2019s shareholders \u2013 even those who mystifyingly wanted to lower the drawbridge for the Kraft Heinz raiders \u2013 should be satisfied. The great Unilever restructuring strikes the right balance. It is shareholder friendly, which is why the share price is up a fifth since Kraft\u2019s non-bid, but it stops short of unnecessary drama such as a full demerger of the food division from personal care. New Unilever, apart from the tired spreads business, will be recognisably like the current creation, complete with a boss preaching the virtues of long-termism and corporate responsibility. Good. It was always ridiculous to caricature the company as an obdurate plodder. As the chief executive, Paul Polman, pointed out, the shareholders haven\u2019t done too badly over the decades. A pound invested in its shares in 1986 is worth \u00a368 today, versus \u00a317 entrusted to a FTSE 100 tracker. But, yes, Unilever can clearly move faster. The ice-cream to soap powder giant has set a target of producing profit margins of 20% by 2020, ignoring restructuring costs. It starts at 16.4% and, on the usually reliable principle that companies only set goals they are very confident of achieving, success is the way to bet. The biggest moving part is an increase in cumulative cost savings over three years from \u20ac4bn to \u20ac6bn. The numbers are big, but Unilever is a big business. Indeed, it can afford to carry another \u20ac10bn of debt, on top of the current \u20ac12bn. Previous reluctance reflected admirable conservatism but if the louder shareholders want more financial leverage the board can grant their wishes without imperilling the credit rating. The concession is easy to make. Unilever\u2019s rethink exceeded expectations in one regard. It will review its dual Anglo-Dutch legal structure, which could mean that either the London or Amsterdam stock market listing will be binned. In purely business terms, one listing in one currency is better than two in two. It makes acquisitions simpler. But Polman will know he\u2019s treading on sensitive ground. Even without the tensions created by Brexit, a departure by Unilever from the London stock market would be a shock. The new \u201cfood and refreshment\u201d unit \u2013 everything from Hellman\u2019s mayonnaise to Lipton tea to Magnum ice-creams \u2013 will have its \u201ccentre of gravity\u201d in the Netherlands. Significant for the listing review? Probably not. It recognises reality on the ground; the personal care and home divisions will remain concentrated in the UK. The Netherlands, though, is seen as tougher terrain than the UK for hostile bidders, with more safeguards in place to block unwanted bids, a point Polman himself has made. On this occasion, he should set such thoughts aside. Judge the listing question purely on commercial grounds, like ease of raising capital. If this sensible rejig works, Unilever, whatever its legal structure, should be capable of fending off future Krafts. BP restraint, of sorts \u201cDear shareholder, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know what I was thinking last time when I signed off Bob Dudley\u2019s $19.4m pay packet in a heavily loss-making year. When I said I was \u2018pleased\u2019 that BP\u2019s pay policy had \u2018appropriately recognised\u2019 the company\u2019s good performance, I should, of course, have said our pay formula was completely broken, impossible to understand and far too generous.\u201d This, you may have guessed, is not how Professor Dame Ann Dowling, head of BP\u2019s remuneration committee, reflected on \u201cthe events of 2016\u201d as she referred to the thumping 59% vote against the pay report. Really, though, an admission that she and her committee made some shockingly poor judgments would be in order. After consulting with the big shareholders, she\u2019s produced a revised policy that is \u201csimpler, transparent and has strategic focus\u201d. Why didn\u2019t the last one fulfil those basic requirements? She\u2019s probably done enough to prevent embarrassment this year. In a better (but not good) year for BP, Dudley is getting 40% less, in part because the pay committee remembered it is allowed to use discretion to tweak bonuses. From now on, the theoretical maximum Dudley can earn before pension payments is $15.3m, a cut of $3.7m. In the world of big oil, that passes for restraint. Dudley, note, has not resigned in fury at the unfairness of it all. Modest pay reform at BP should not have been as hard as Dowling made it seem.",

It recognises reality on the ground; the personal care and home divisions will remain concentrated in the UK.</p> <p>The Netherlands, though, is seen as tougher terrain than the UK for hostile bidders, with more safeguards in place to block unwanted bids, a point <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/14/unilever-british-companies-foreign-bids-marmite-kraft-heinz\">Polman himself has made</a>. On this occasion, he should set such thoughts aside. Judge the listing question purely on commercial grounds, like ease of raising capital. If this sensible rejig works, Unilever, whatever its legal structure, should be capable of fending off future Krafts.</p> <h2>BP restraint, of sorts</h2> <p>\u201cDear shareholder, I\u2019m sorry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/18/bp-bob-dudley-pay-package-shareholder\">I don\u2019t know what I was thinking last time when I signed off Bob Dudley\u2019s $19.4m pay packet in a heavily loss-making year.</a> When I said I was \u2018pleased\u2019 that BP\u2019s pay policy had \u2018appropriately recognised\u2019 the company\u2019s good performance, I should, of course, have said our pay formula was completely broken, impossible to understand and far too generous.\u201d</p> <p>This, you may have guessed, is not how Professor Dame Ann Dowling, head of BP\u2019s remuneration committee, reflected on \u201cthe events of 2016\u201d as she referred to the thumping 59% vote against the pay report.</p> <p>Really, though, an admission that she and her committee made some shockingly poor judgments would be in order. After consulting with the big shareholders, she\u2019s produced a revised policy that is \u201csimpler, transparent and has strategic focus\u201d. Why didn\u2019t the last one fulfil those basic requirements?</p> <p>She\u2019s probably done enough to prevent embarrassment this year. In a better (but not good) year for BP, Dudley is getting 40% less, in part because the pay committee remembered it is allowed to use discretion to tweak bonuses.</p> <p>From now on, the theoretical maximum Dudley can earn before pension payments is $15.3m, a cut of $3.7m. In the world of big oil, that passes for restraint. Dudley, note, has not resigned in fury at the unfairness of it all. Modest pay reform at BP should not have been as hard as Dowling made it seem.</p>",
