      "bodyText": "As expected, the Reserve Bank of Australia kept the interest rate on hold at 1.5% this week, but the latest building approval figures out on Wednesday highlight the difficulty for the central bank and for government of balancing an economy growing at starkly different speeds. The RBA\u2019s decision to keep the cash rate at 1.5% was not a shock. The market factored in next to no chance of a cut and, since the decision, it has become even more confident that there will not be another rate cut: But the problem for the RBA is that while the overall economic numbers are not fantastic \u2013 employment growth, for example, is pretty limp \u2013 the picture across the nation is very diverse. The latest building approval figures highlight this perfectly. While the overall number of building approvals fell in September, this was due to a fall in the number of non-housing dwellings \u2013 apartments, flats, etc. The approval of these is always pretty lumpy due to a more complex approval process than for houses. In seasonally adjusted terms, there was a 16% drop in non-house approvals, but house approvals actually rose 2%. Even when we look at the trend growth, it is clear that while the national figures show improvement, they\u2019re certainly not going gangbusters like they were through most of 2014 and 2015: The national picture hides the very different situations in each state. New South Wales (primarily Sydney) has seen strong growth in the past year. Victoria has also seen an increase in residential building approvals in the past year, although it has begun to slide a bit. But the rest of the country? Going backwards, and backwards fast: And when we include the Australian Capital Territory in the mix (which has seen a 95% increase in building approvals over the past year), the south-eastern part of the continent is far outpacing the rest: In September, in NSW, Victoria and the ACT, there were 13,702 dwelling unit approvals (both houses and non-houses) compared with just 6,746 in the rest of the country. That is the largest disparity across those two sections of the country since the Australian Bureau of Statistics began collating the data in 1983. Similarly, the gap in the annual growth of approvals in NSW, Victoria and the ACT combined compared with the rest of the country is greater than it has ever been \u2013 far greater than it was in the few years before the GFC, when the talk was of the \u201ctwo-speed economy\u201d due to the mining boom in Western Australia and Queensland: It makes for a tough life for the RBA, which gets to set one cash rate for the entire country, especially when you look at what is generating the big growth in buildings. In Sydney it is not houses, but apartments that are booming: The RBA has already expressed some concern over the growing number of apartments in Sydney (and Melbourne and Brisbane), and on Tuesday it again noted that \u201cconsiderable supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities\u201d. Cutting interest rates would only serve to have that stream flow faster \u2013 something the RBA might not be disposed to do, given its concerns about a possible glut of apartments In Victoria, the surge of apartment building does appear to have halted, but remains at an historically high level: Whereas in WA, both the approval for apartments and houses is on a two-year slide: And WA also shows how the housing market can lag behind other parts of the economy \u2013 for the value of residential building kept rising in 2014 while the value of non-residential buildings began to fall: At the start of 2013 the value of both residential and non-residential building approvals was almost the same. Now residential approvals are almost back to that level, while the value of non-residential building is about 30% lower. But there may be cause for some cheer out west. This week the RBA also released its latest index of commodity prices. In October, the value of the bulk commodity index \u2013 which includes iron ore, metallurgical coal and thermal coal prices \u2013 rose 15%, the fourth-biggest monthly jump in the index\u2019s history: Whether the increase in prices for coal and iron ore will be high enough and sustained will determine if it leads to more non-residential building work in the mining sector. And for those in the west, they will hope so. Because for now, with things the way they are, the RBA will likely keep the cash rate at 1.5%, and those outside NSW and Victoria will have to look elsewhere for something to spur their economies.",

That is the experience of the business select committee as responses arrive to its corporate governance inquiry. The MPs may regret setting the terms of reference so widely. The best advice: throw the technical tweaks in the bin and concentrate on the simple ideas. Here\u2019s a proposal on pay that starts from admirably straightforward (and correct) premise that \u201cthe executive remuneration system is seriously discredited and needs substantial reform\u201d. So says the Institute of Business Ethics. It says cash should be restored as the essential currency of paying executives. In other words, abolish share options, performance share awards, deferred awards and most of the padding of modern remuneration schemes. The law should be changed to forbid payments that cannot be valued properly at the time of award. Salaries would go up, naturally, but the institute proposes a few sub-clauses. First, executives would have to spend an agreed portion of their higher salaries on the company\u2019s shares and then hold that stock for years, even beyond retirement. Second, any salary increase or cash bonus wouldn\u2019t become effective until shareholders had voted. Third, if the executives still wanted big cash bonuses (more than 25% of salary, say), they\u2019d have to give the same award in proportion to all employees, which would be fair. The main advantage of this approach is that executives would build up a shareholding over time and receive dividends on those shares, which should encourage more long-term thinking in boardrooms. Bonuses, which the outside world rightly regards as a racket because zero is awarded only when catastrophe strikes, would become a side-show. And shareholders would be directly on the hook for what executives are paid. The practical difficulty is that the public might not like the notion that a FTSE 100 chief executive\u2019s \u00a31m-a-year salary could become \u00a32m-a-year or more once the share-based carrots are scrapped. But the virtues of the system would be simplicity and transparency, which are currently woefully under-supplied. Indeed, as the institute did not say, there would be another benefit. The small industry of remuneration consultants, which has grown rich by peddling baffling pay schemes that produce perverse results, could be made redundant. Few would mourn its passing. Beware the booze wars It\u2019s a bit rich for Tim Martin, the pro-Brexit chairman of pub chain JD Wetherspoon, to complain about how the result of the referendum has created uncertainties for his business, his customers and his suppliers. He might have considered the possibility before distributing beer mats promoting exit from the European Union. But let\u2019s not be too churlish about Martin\u2019s lively rant about the \u201chectoring and bullying approach\u201d adopted by Angela Merkel, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and the man he calls \u201cthe unelected EU \u2018President\u2019 Juncker\u201d. Behind the rhetoric lies a serious point: British punters drink an awful lot of continental booze. French wine, champagne and spirits, German beer and Swedish cider are \u201cat extreme risk,\u201d claims Martin, if UK consumers take offence at the Junckerist idea that the country must be punished for leaving the EU. He is surely over-stating matters in expecting a patriotic rebellion by consumers. But the EU tariff system on wine imports to the single market was designed to protect the French industry. Like Martin, the powerful French agricultural lobby will also be very keen for tariff-free trading in food and drink to continue. Persimmon\u2019s pessimism Still on Brexit matters, housebuilder Persimmon says the referendum had no impact on its \u201cencouraging\u201d sales over the summer. But here\u2019s the line that will annoy Theresa May as she attempts to boost the number of homes built in the UK: the country\u2019s second biggest housebuilder says it is turning \u201ccautious\u201d on land purchases because of \u201cthe uncertainty surrounding the potential impact of the EU referendum result on the UK economy\u201d. Investment in land and house construction are not the same thing, of course, but nor are they unrelated. The government would rightly be miffed by any sign of a go-slow by a company that enjoyed a 22% profit margin last year, thanks in part to those Treasury-sponsored Help to Buy schemes, and is overflowing with cash. But what could May actually do to give Persimmon and its peers a kick? If she has the answer, she hasn\u2019t shared it.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s food industry is facing the worst labour shortage for at least 12 years as farmers, manufacturers and processors struggle to find enough workers to prepare for the Christmas rush. The warning comes amid fears of a shortage of truck and van drivers to deliver goods to shops and homes. David Camp of the Association of Labour Providers (ALP), whose employment agency members supply 70% of the temporary labour used by the food and drink industry in the UK, said responses to job ads had slumped as workers from the EU \u2013 who account for 90% of jobs in the sector \u2013 back away from the UK. Response rates to the ALP\u2019s biggest member\u2019s job adverts are running at only 52% of the level of last year. Camp said that other members had seen responses fall by up to 70%, depending on the sector they were in and their location. Camp told the Food and Drink Federation\u2019s Brexit conference that for the first time he could remember \u201cwe are not going to meet all the supply needed for the Christmas peak\u201d. \u201cAt this moment in time, labour providers are experiencing the worst labour shortage since before 2004,\u201d he said. Camp said the fall in the value of the pound had combined with fears of anti-migrant sentiment to deter European nationals. High levels of employment, which meant there were \u201cvacancies in easier work, better-paying work and in permanent work over temporary work\u201d, had also made it tricky to hire staff. \u201cThe reduction in the value of the pound means the exchange value of your wages back into your home currency is worth 15% less than it was,\u201d he said. \u201cThat absolutely wipes out the increase in the \u2018national living wage\u2019. There is [also] the anti-migrant sentiment. Things do get built up in the media but my members were reporting back they were seeing actual cases of race hate and anti-migrant sentiment.\u201d Camp\u2019s comments came as the National Farmers Union called on the government to introduce new measures to prevent a shortfall in agricultural workers next year. \u201cWe\u2019re already experiencing a shortfall in EU workers resulting from long-term declines and exacerbated by the referendum outcome,\u201d said NFU horticulture board chair Ali Capper after meeting Robert Goodwill, minister of state for immigration. \u201cWe are satisfied that the Home Office has a full understanding of how important access to a competent, flexible and reliable workforce is for food production. However, without basic assurances from government that this labour will be accessible in future, grower businesses face huge uncertainty and are delaying investment in British production.\u201d Horticulture alone needs around 80,000 seasonal workers to pick and pack fruit, vegetable and plant crops across the country. The food delivery network is also concerned about difficulties in attracting EU workers. The Freight Transport Association calculates the shortfall between the number of registered HGVs and the number of qualified drivers is 34,567. The shortfall is down year on year as the industry has increased pay through higher overtime and bonus payments. But the FTA warns that Brexit could reverse the progress. James Hookham, deputy chief executive, said about 10% of drivers licensed for large goods vehicles and 9% of van drivers were EU nationals and there was \u201ca lot of concern and worry\u201d among them about the future, given the fall in the value of the pound and uncertainty about their rights of residence and employment post Brexit. \u201cI would be expecting that to manifest itself in the next six months or so,\u201d Hookham said. We are going to see people acting on those fears if the pound worsens in value against the euro never mind the deplorable villification [of EU migrants].\u201d He said that workers and employers needed the government to provide reassurance about the future position of EU nationals in the UK labour market. \u201cIt is all very well the government saying they want to keep their cards close to their chest but people are deciding with their feet.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Investors flocked into the haven of gold on Wednesday amid jitters in the global financial markets prompted by fears that Donald Trump could pull off a shock Brexit-style victory in the US presidential race. Shares and the US dollar also fell after opinion polls suggested that the contest between Trump and his Democrat opponent, Hillary Clinton, was now too close to call. Wall Street\u2019s assumption that Clinton was cruising to a comfortable victory has been shattered by the FBI\u2019s announcement on Friday that it was looking into a batch of freshly discovered emails that might have a bearing on its investigation into the former US secretary of state. As the battle for the White House entered its final days, evidence that Clinton\u2019s seemingly unassailable lead has been whittled away led investors to speculate on a repeat of the UK\u2019s EU referendum in June, when opinion polls were suggesting a victory for the remain side throughout the campaign and up until the polls closed. \u201cNow that it\u2019s a bit less certain that [Clinton] is going to win, we\u2019re seeing the impact of investors finally taking evasive action \u2013 probably evasive action which they should have taken a month ago,\u201d said Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index. \u201cThe caution is setting in.\u201d Paresh Davdra, chief executive of RationalFX, said: \u201cDespite seeming improbable to most of us for the majority of the last year, the prospect of a Trump presidency has long unsettled economists and market analysts, who predicted he would bring uncertainty to markets. \u201cThis was highlighted [on Wednesday] by a poll that showed that a Trump win was the likely result of next week\u2019s election, causing global markets to panic and investors to back away from the dollar. Now that the stability represented by Clinton is no longer assured, the following week will be a tense period as global markets seek to avoid the kind of complacency shown before the Brexit vote.\u201d Gold rose $15 to stand at just over $1,300 an ounce as investors sought out safe havens in the event of a defeat for Clinton. Meanwhile, the dollar lost ground against the euro, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and the recently battered pound. Sterling was up two-thirds of a cent against the greenback to just over $1.23 \u2013 its highest level in three weeks. Shares dropped on the world\u2019s major bourses, with the leading index of UK shares \u2013 the FTSE 100 \u2013 closing 72 points lower at 6,845. In New York, the S&amp;P 500 was on course in early trading to post its seventh consecutive day of losses. Financial markets were also rattled by a 3% drop in oil prices following news of the biggest increase in crude stocks in the US since modern records began in 1982. The cost of a barrel of US light crude dropped by almost $1.50 on news that oil inventories in the past week had jumped by more than 14bn barrels compared with the 1bn barrel increase dealers had expected. The Federal Reserve, the US central bank, continued its wait-and-see approach to interest rates at the end of a two-day meeting. But the Fed dropped a broad hint that it would act at its next meeting in December by saying that there was not enough evidence \u201cfor the time being\u201d to warrant higher borrowing costs. Andrew Hunter, US economist at Capital Economics, said there was a risk that the unsettled mood in the financial markets could linger on even when the result of next Tuesday\u2019s election was known since there was a risk of a repeat of events 16 years ago when the race between George Bush and Al Gore was finally decided by the Supreme Court weeks after polling day. \u201cThe presidential election race is now too close to call, raising the possibility of a near-tied election result that would be aggressively disputed by one or both of the candidates,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cUnder those circumstances, the infamous 2000 election suggests that the uncertainty could persist for at least a month and could weigh heavily on the stock market during that time.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "But it is not a given that the Fed will hike in December, says economist James Knightley at ING Bank: There is little in the statement to suggest that a December hike is definitely going to happen (markets currently pricing in a 67% chance of a move). The statement comments that \u201dthe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen\u201d while adding the word \u201csome\u201d to the line that it wants to \u201cwait for SOME further evidence of continued progress towards its objectives\u201d. This all suggests that things are moving in the right direction, but the Presidential election is an obvious reason for waiting. Assuming Clinton wins, markets are likely to react with relief given expectations of policy continuity. This, coupled with the reasonably firm growth, rising employment and a gradual pick-up in inflation should reinforce market expectations for a December rate hike. Should Trump win then this is likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually do when in power. It is hard to imagine the Fed hiking in this environment. We also have plenty more data to come ahead of the December 14 FOMC meeting, including two more job reports so there are other reasons for caution. The Fed statement has failed to give much support to the dollar, and US markets have struggled for direction after the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 33 points, compared to around 70 ahead of the statement. The US dollar index has lost 0.3% to 97.38. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Although there was no rate change today, it looks increasingly likely there will be one in December. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: With just days to go before election fever sweeps America, Janet Yellen\u2019s Federal Interest Rate statement held no shocks with rates remaining the same. However, it\u2019s becoming ever more likely that Yellen will implement a raise early next month following signs that the American economy is gradually picking up steam. She made clear in September that a rise before the end of 2016 was more than likely and with employment and inflation continuing to strengthen the central bank may get its wish. The Fed has dropped a reference to inflation remaining low in the near term. In September it said: Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. This now reads: Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. The Fed said in its statement: The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. This time there were only two Fed dissenters who wanted to raise rates not three, Esther George and Loretta Mester. Eric Rosengren, who voted for a rise last time, has now sided with the majority. BREAKING NEWS To no one\u2019s great surprise, the Federal Reserve has opted to leave US interest rates unchanged just days ahead of the presidential election. It said it was waiting for further evidence of progress towards its objectives before hiking. The US Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision will be released in less than an hour. While most commentators expect there to be no change - not this close to the presidential election - the prospect of a rate rise in December is thought to be reasonably likely, given the recent reassuring US economic data. There is likely to be a focus - as usual - on the exact wording of the Fed statement and whether it shows any changes from the September comments. At that meeting seven of the Fed members voted for no change, with three, Esther George, Loretta Mester, and Eric Rosengren, backing an increase. Any variance here could also give a clue to the likely outcome in December. Investors have been unnerved by suggestions that Donald Trump is gaining ground in the US presidential race, with one poll this week even showing him in the lead over Hillary Clinton. Combined with a slump in oil prices following a record weekly rise in US crude stocks, this has pushed markets in Europe sharply lower. But on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lost 100 points or so on Tuesday, has not been hit as badly (so far), and is currently down just 20 points ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Meanwhile the Vix index of volatility, seen as a gauge of investor fears, is up 3% to 19. When Clinton looked a shoo-in to win, the index was hovering around 13. But despite this recent rise, it is still well below the 25 level it reached after the Brexit vote in June. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Less than a week out from the US election and markets are demonstrating both complacency and a palpable fear at the same time. A surge in the VIX index shows volatility is on the rise and investors are hedging equity exposure with safe havens like gold and government bonds. But at the same time equity benchmarks are only modestly down, showing an overriding comfort in owning stocks. The VIX is up over 40% in the last seven days, reaching above 18, a level in which many investors sit up and pay attention to signs of heightened risk in the market. Over that same period the FTSE 100 and S&amp;P 500 are down 2-3%. There is still a general perception that Hillary Clinton will take the White House, but the surprise Brexit result is fresh in minds of investors and they are buying gold and VIX index tracking products to hedge their bets. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 71.72 points or 1.04% to 6845.42, its lowest level since 27 September Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.47% to 10,370.93 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.24% at 4414.67 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 2.51% lower at 16,474.52 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.85% at 8873.4 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 581.56. Ahead of the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision in a couple of hours and the Bank of England meeting tomorrow, the dollar continues to weaken against the pound. Jitters about the prospect of Donald Trump winning the White House have sent the US currency lower, to the benefit of sterling which is now up 0.57% at $1.2313, a three week high. The pound is not faring so well against the euro but nor is it losing ground, being pretty much unchanged at \u20ac1.1078. Back with oil: Global manufacturing grew at the fastest rate for two years in October, according to data from purchasing managers surveys in more than 30 countries. The JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI, compiled by Markit, rose to 52 in October form 51 the previous month, its highest since October 2014. Markit said the surveys hinted at \u201c a welcome resurgence of life in the world\u2019s factories at the start of the fourth quarter. Inflationary pressures also picked up to the highest for nearly three years.\u201d It said the data were roughly consistent with global manufacturing output rising at a reasonable 4% annual pace. With investors spooked by the prospect of Donald Trump possibly winning the US election, not to mention the plunge in oil prices following the jump in US crude stocks, markets remain under pressure. The FTSE 100 is currently down 0.9%, Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 1.2% and France\u2019s Cac has lost 1.1%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has not been so badly hit and is currently 0.2% lower. That could mean that investors are not necessarily convinced by polls showing Trump in the lead. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: The markets are not in full on panic mode right now, suggesting that they still think Clinton could clinch a win next week. This is reflected in the Vix volatility index, which is considered a fear gauge for Wall Street. Even though it has risen in recent days it is still below 20%, to put this in context, after the Brexit vote in June volatility spiked above 25%. Global stock markets are generally lower on Wednesday, but US markets have outperformed their European counterparts even with 6 days to go before the US election. Interestingly, the Dow Jones Transport Index, considered a lead indicator for Wall Street, is higher today. Considering a Trump presidency is considered the worst outcome for the US economy, the fact that this index has not fallen further on the back of the bad poll news for the Clinton camp, suggests that the US equity market may not sell off sharply until volatility spikes further, or until the actual result is confirmed. But the other potentially market moving event is the US Federal Reserve interest rate announcement later. Brooks said: The market is expecting a 14% chance of a hike tonight. If the Fed does hike, that would throw the cat among the pigeons, and we could see a steeper sell off in equities, a rally in bond yields and a broad-based recovery in the dollar. However, in our view the bigger risk from today\u2019s meeting could be a dovish slant from the Federal Reserve, who may not want to commit to a rate hike until the election result is confirmed. Although the Fed is expected to be politically neutral, a potential market sell-off on the back of a win for Trump next week could put the prospect of a December rate hike to bed for the Fed. Added to this, the Fed chair and vice chair have given speeches with fairly dovish slants in recent weeks, so a sell-off in the dollar on Wednesday could be in advance of a dovish \u201cshock\u201d from the Fed later on today. Oil prices are under pressure again after a much bigger than expected rise in US crude stocks. Last week, crude stocks rose 14.42m barrels to 482.58m compared to expectations of an increase of just 1m barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration. This is the highest weekly build on record. Last week there was a 0.55m fall in oil stocks. Gasoline stocks fell by 2.21m barrels, higher than the 1.9m drop expected. A rise in stocks reported by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday had already signalled a jump in the EIA figures was possible: With the build in stocks signalling oversupply and falling demand, Brent crude is on the slide, down 2.89% to $46.75 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has dropped 3.2% to $45.15. Time for a quick recap. World markets are falling back today, as investors get a bad case of pre-US election jitters. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit its lowest level since the end of September, while the pound has popped over $1.23 for the first time in three weeks. Moody\u2019s has warned that the UK will be downgraded if it loses \u2018core\u2019 access to the EU single market after Brexit. The credit rating agency says growth will suffer if British firms lose their current access: One scenario that Moody\u2019s considers to be realistic is a series of accords offering access to the EU market for goods and more constrained access for services, in particular financial services. However, such an outcome is far from certain. Alastair Darling, the former UK chancellor, says there is an \u2018urgent need\u2019 for Britain and the EU to hold grown-up talks about the situation. But UK drinkers may find themselves struggling to find a pint of foreign beer in their local Wetherspoons. Chairman Tim Martin says he\u2019ll take steps if Brussels keeps \u2018bullying\u2019 the UK. A UK court will rule tomorrow on whether Theresa May trigger article 50 and begin the Brexit process without MPs voting on the issue. Set your alarm for 10am GMT! Nervous investors have just pushed the gold price up to a new one-month high,at $1,300.91 per ounce. Moody\u2019s warning that Britain\u2019s credit rating is vulnerable hasn\u2019t improved the mood in the City. The FTSE 100 is still hovering at a one-month low, down 32 points at 6884. The other European markets are also in the red, down around 0.8%, leaving the Stoxx 600 index at its lowest since July. And shares are also dropping on Wall Street at the start of trading: Investors are still worrying about that opinion poll, putting Donald Trump narrowly ahead of Hillary Clinton. So the dollar remains under pressure , keeping the pound up over the $1.23 mark for the first time in two weeks. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown currency service, says: The dollar is broadly lower ahead of tonight\u2019s Federal Reserve interest rate decision, with US election anxieties returning to the fore after Clinton\u2019s lead over Trump in the polls has evaporated following the new FBI probe into her personal email use. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says investors are suddenly considering that Trump has a real chance of victory, following the FBI\u2019s new probe into Clinton\u2019s emails. Global stock markets are lower this morning, as US election fears dominate, despite a week\u2019s worth of top tier data to contend with. The sudden change in fortunes set in train on Friday has seen investors run for cover amid a realisation that Trump might actually win. Here\u2019s our latest report from the US campaign trail. Here\u2019s our news story about Moody\u2019s Brexit warning, plus some other developments: A new survey of US employment has come in weaker than expected. The monthly ADP survey shows that US companies created 147,000 new jobs in October, shy of the 165,000 which economists expected. The construction sector saw a sharp drop in employment, down 15,000. This may suggest that Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll - the main measure of US employment -- will be weak..... We\u2019ve also seen signs today that Britain\u2019s housing market may be slowing. First, Nationwide reported that prices stalled last month - ending a 15 month run of rising prices. Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, says the market seems \u201cfairly subdued\u201d. Second.. data firm Markit\u2019s latest survey of the building sector painted a mixed picture. The construction PMI (which tracks activity) rose to 52.6 from 52.3, which shows business activity increases at fastest pace since March. But...new order growth slowed, and business confidence dipped sharply to its second-lowest level since May 2013. Markit says it\u2019s partly due to the EU referendum. A number of survey respondents cited the impact of Brexit uncertainty on investor sentiment, alongside reduced confidence towards the general economic outlook. Ireland\u2019s leader, Enda Kenny, has warned that negotiations between EU states over Britain\u2019s exit from Europe \u201ccould turn vicious.\u201d Speaking at a Brexit conference in Dublin, Kenny said he and Theresa May are both committed to avoiding a new border being built between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Kenny said: Neither I, nor the prime minister, desire to limit the freedom of people on both sides of the Irish sea to trade, live, work and travel freely across these islands. And he also hinted at the tensions already developing between London and the rest of the EU: If you go to Downing Street, if you drop in there it\u2019s fine, but sometimes when friends call they can overstay their welcome. Our Politics Live blog has all the details: Heads-up: Bloomberg\u2019s legal correspondent says the high court will rule tomorrow morning whether article 50 can be triggered without a parliamentary vote: Kerching! The pound just hit $1.23 for the first time in two weeks. Sterling has now gained one and a half-cents since Monday morning, partly due to relief that Mark Carney will stay as Bank of England governor until June 2019. Today\u2019s rally is mainly due to fears over the US election (as covered earlier), which have sent the dollar down against the yen, the euro and the Swiss franc as well. Moody\u2019s new report on the consequences of the EU referendum is only available to its customers, but there\u2019s a summary here: Moody\u2019s: UK sovereign rating would be downgraded if the UK was unable to conclude an agreement with the EU that protected core elements of its access to the Single Market The rating agency also has bad news for Remain supporters who are hoping that Brexit might not happen: In Moody\u2019s view, there is little likelihood that the UK will not exit the EU. The prospect of Wetherspoon\u2019s ditching European drinks brands in a Brexit protest has caused quite a stir. Historian Greg Jenner was reminded of the great Gin Craze that gripped Britain three hundred years ago, when the UK tried to restrict imports of French brandy in favour of British gin. It backfired, though, once Britons developed quite a thirst for it. Journalist Rupert Myers suggests such a move might backfire on \u2018Spoon: Juho Romakkaniemi, head of cabinet to EC vice-president Jyrki Katainen, has criticised the idea. Some people have even suggested that it sounds like a skit from The Pub Landlord, Al Murray\u2019s satirical character. And it soon might be.... Alastair Darling, the former chancellor of the exchequer, says Theresa May urgently needs to give clarity about the sort of Brexit deal she wants. Speaking a moment ago, Lord Darling says the prime minister needs to spell out her plans, so a \u201cgrown-up conversation\u201d can take place with Brussels. That would help Britain to fulfil June\u2019s referendum while limiting the long-term economic damage of Brexit, he argues. Darling told Bloomberg TV that: The referendum decision is the biggest single challenge facing the UK arguably since the end of the Second World War. Darling points out that Nissan, the Japanese car maker, has received assurances from May which gave it the confidence to build two new models at its Sunderland plant. That could indicate that May wants Britain to remain part of the single market, and the customs union, Darling adds - but is that just for the auto sector? What about the banks, who rely on passporting to offer services across the EU? We\u2019ve got to salvage as much as we can so we don\u2019t disrupt trade and damage the UK\u2019s long-term growth prospects. It\u2019s a pertinent point, given Moody\u2019s warning earlier today. Darling argues that the government cannot \u201csegregate out\u201d the UK economy, dealing with some concerns immediately (eg Nissan) and leaving other sectors in the dark for a couple of years. \u201cThe one things all businesses don\u2019t like is uncertainty\u201d Darling, who was Britain\u2019s finance minister during the 2008 crisis, says that both sides have to \u201crecognise the new reality, and get on with it.\u201d The boss of pub chain JD Wetherspoon has weighed in on Brexit this morning, threatening to ditch European drinks brands unless EU leaders stop \u201cbullying\u201d Britain. Tim Martin is not happy that European Commission chief Jean Claude Juncker, French President Francois Hollande and German chancellor Angela Merkel have all said Britain should pay a high price for leaving the EU. He told the Guardian this morning that he\u2019s prepared to throw out foreign drinks brands, and replace them with British alternatives. \u201cI don\u2019t think Wetherspoon or British buyers are in a weak position because we can switch from Swedish cider to British cider. So the people put in a weak position are the sellers and I think that is the paradox that has not been illustrated. The UK is in a much more powerful position than most economists would assume.\u201d Martin (who was in favour of leaving the EU) also suggested the UK consumers could vote with their wallets and shun French champagne and German beer. Moody\u2019s is also concerned that the UK government might wilt under the pressure of exiting the European Union, leading investors to lose faith in Britain\u2019s fiscal credibility. Kathrin Muehlbronner says: The UK will have to handle multiple, complicated policy decisions in areas including global trade, immigration and regulation. Given the magnitude and complexity of these decisions, the risk is material that some might damage the UK\u2019s economic or fiscal strength. NEWSFLASH: Britain could suffer another credit rating downgrade if Theresa May fails to get a decent Brexit deal from Europe. In a new report, Moody\u2019s says that it would slash Britain\u2019s credit rating if UK companies lose \u2018core access\u2019 to the single market. It believes the terms at which Britain can trade with the rest of Europe after Brexit are crucial to the country\u2019s long-term prosperity. Kathrin Muehlbronner, senior vice-president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, says : \u201cWe would downgrade the UK\u2019s sovereign rating if the outcome of the negotiations with the EU was a loss of access to the Single Market as this would materially damage its medium-term growth prospects. A second trigger for a downgrade would be if we were to conclude that the credibility of the UK\u2019s fiscal policy had been tarnished as a result of Brexit or other reasons.\u201d Moody\u2019s singles out the \u2018passporting\u2019 currently enjoyed by the City, which allow banks in London to offer services across the EU. If these rights are lost, then it would be \u2018credit negative\u2019 for the UK banking sector\u2019s rating, but not enough to prompt a downgrade. Moody\u2019s currently rates the UK as Aa1, which is the second-highest rating. It downgraded the outlook on 24th June, in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum. In the report, Moody\u2019s predicts that the UK will carve out \u201csome form of free trade agreement with the EU\u201d. One scenario that Moody\u2019s considers to be realistic is a series of accords offering access to the EU market for goods and more constrained access for services, in particular financial services. However, such an outcome is far from certain. Theresa May has said she intends to get the \u201cmaximum possible access to the single market\u201d, while also bringing in new controls on immigration. However, European politicians have warned that they\u2019re not prepared to sacrifice the \u2018four freedoms\u2019 - free movement of labour, capital, goods and services. And yesterday, an influential European MEP warned that Britain can\u2019t agree a new trade deal until it has left the EU. Danuta H\u00fcbner, a former Polish minister who became the country\u2019s first European commissioner, told the Guardian: \u201cFormally you cannot conclude or even negotiate the agreement that belongs to a third-country situation while you are still a member. Article 50 is only about withdrawal and only when you are out can [you] negotiate another agreement. Here are the key points from Moody\u2019s report: Moody\u2019s would downgrade the UK\u2019s rating if we were to conclude that the UK\u2019s loss of access to the Single Market would materially weaken medium-term growth. A second driver for the UK rating will be the fiscal outlook, on which we expect to obtain significantly more clarity with the upcoming Autumn Statement, scheduled for 23 November. A wide-ranging Free Trade Agreement which would limit the negative impact of Brexit on growth remains a plausible but not certain outcome. Moody\u2019s negative outlook for the UK banking system reflects Brexit-induced uncertainties, which are exerting pressure on the revenues, asset quality and profitability of all UK banks, although some are more resilient to such strains than others. Brexit-related loss of \u201cpassporting\u201d rights for UK banks that operate across jurisdictions would be credit negative but manageable. The resulting higher costs and reduced inefficiencies are not sufficient to pressure the ratings. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx sums up a nervous morning in the City: A fresh batch of pre-US election jitters has swept the markets this morning, investors fretting over news that Trump has taken the lead in a national poll. While Clinton is still ahead in the majority of surveys, the fact that the orange-faced Republican nominee has clawed his way back to being a potential victor in the aftermath of the FBI email scandal has sent a wave of fear through first the Asian markets, and now the European open. While that means the FTSE has dropped 30 points, taking it under 6900 for the first time in over a month, with the DAX and CAC also shedding 0.6% apiece, it has led to a moment of respite for the pound, which rose back above 1.22 against the weakened dollar. Some good news amid the gloom. The eurozone\u2019s factory sector has posted its fastest growth in nearly three years. That\u2019s via data firm Markit, which reports that growth picked up across the region (apart from in poor old Greece, which suffered a contraction). The US dollar is having a bad morning, allowing the British pound some relief. Sterling has hit a two-week high of $1.227 this morning, as US election worries trump (ahem) Brexit fears. The dollar has also clattered to a three week low against the euro, a one-month low against the Swiss franc, and a two-week low against the Japanese yen. However, the US dollar has gained against emerging market currencies - such as the Mexican peso. Kit Juckes, currency expert of Societe Generale, says investors may struggle to work out the market implications of a Republican win next week: It\u2019s easy to see Trump as \u2018bad\u2019 for Mexico in particular and for US trade-dependent economies in general but there are limits to what a President can legislate. This isn\u2019t like the UK\u2019s EU referendum, where the potential medium-term economic damage of leaving the single market is much clearer. However, with less than a week to go, market opinion is coming to the conclusion that a Trump win would create too much uncertainty and is bad for risk sentiment generally. The odds on Donald Trump becoming the most powerful man in the world have narrowed recently, but he\u2019s still only a 27% shot at Betfair. However, you might remember that the Remain campaign had a healthy lead on 23 June, and we all know what happened next. Nervous investors are selling shares, and putting the money into government debt this morning, in another sign of Trump-related jitters. That\u2019s driving up prices, and cutting the interest rate on the bonds. Reuters has the details: British government bond prices jumped on Wednesday, tracking U.S. and German debt prices higher as markets reacted to increased uncertainty about next week\u2019s U.S. presidential election. Ten-year gilt yields dropped more than 8 basis points on the day to a six-day low of 1.197%, while two-year yields fell nearly 6 basis points to 0.207%, their lowest since Oct. 21. The move in gilts and many other European government bonds followed a similar fall in U.S. Treasury yields as investors started to rethink their long-held bets of a victory for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on signs her Republican rival Donald Trump could be closing the gap. FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed reckons markets are in the \u201cearly stages of panic\u201d about next week\u2019s election. Investors are dumping risk assets this morning as latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking polls showed Trump ahead of Clinton for the first time. Trump\u2019s odds for winning the U.S. elections increased after the FBI reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private server and he will maximise his leverage on the case with less than a week remaining to the election date. Most major Asian equity indices fell by more than 1%, as Wall Street\u2019s fear index \u201cVIX\u201d soared above 20 levels for the first time since September 12. The Mexican peso which has become the popular election proxy also fell this morning, declining by more than 4.3% for the past six trading days. And with the dollar weakening, Sayed expects a \u201ca roller coaster ride for the next couple of days\u201d. The post Brexit vote market reaction is still fresh in investors\u2019 memory and no one wants to be caught on the wrong side of the trade, it will only take another one or two polls showing a Trump lead to boost markets anxiety and thus a steep sell off in equity markets and high beta currencies. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 index, which includes the 600 largest companies across the region, has hit its lowest level since 11 July. Every one of the main European stock market sectors is falling this morning, led by the banks: European stock markets have opened in the red, as US election angst hits the City. The FTSE 100 shed 40 points at the open, or 0.6%, to 6875. That\u2019s its lowest level since 30 September. Across the channel, shares are falling too. Germany\u2019s DAX lost 0.8%, France\u2019s CAC dropped 0.7%, Spain\u2019s IBEX shed 0.9%, and the Italian FTSE MIB is down 0.5%. This follows last night\u2019s nervy session on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones index closed down 100 points, and the overnight losses in Asia that drove the yen and gold higher. Mike van Dulken &amp; Henry Croft at Accendo Markets explain: Anxious investors the world over are pricing in an even tighter US election race, with increased fears of a Trump win next week and the political, economic and market uncertainty that would surely ensue. The probability of a Clinton win may remain high but a blindside Brexit result is also still very fresh in the memory of market participants. This chart show how investors are becoming more nervous (the white line), as the Mexican peso (seen as vulnerable to a Trump victory) has dropped (blue line). The yen is extending its gains against the US dollar as I type - hitting \u00a5103.57 to the $1. That\u2019s the highest since October 21st. Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities, says Trump vs Clinton is now the number one issue worrying investors: \u201cIt\u2019s becoming all about the U.S. elections. Markets are trying to factor in the changing atmosphere.\u201d Investors are piling into safe-haven assets such as gold and the Japanese yen, after the ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll put Trump in the lead. This sent the dollar down to 103.69 yen, from 104.14 on Tuesday night. The Mexican peso was another casualty, weakening to 19.31 to the US dollar, from 19.18 last night. Elsa Lignos, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, explains: The probability of a Trump victory has risen materially since last Friday. On FiveThirtyEight\u2019s models it is back to 28\u201330%, levels not seen since before the second debate and the controversial NBC video leak. Although Trump\u2019s chances have been rising steadily since Friday, yesterday set off a scramble for election hedges. Stock markets are coming under pressure today as international investors become increasingly anxious about the US presidential election. In exactly one week\u2019s time, we\u2019ll know whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump has won the race to the White House. And with the polls seemingly closing, shares are on the slide. Asia\u2019s stock markets have fallen overnight, hitting their lowest level in seven weeks. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell by 1.7%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng lost 1.4%, and Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX200 shed 1.1%. This followed losses on Wall Street last night, where stock market volatility hit its highest level since Britain\u2019s EU referendum in June. Gold, which usually rallies at times of anxiety, has hit a four-week high at $1,293.00 It was triggered by a new ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll which put Trump one point ahead. Hillary Clinton\u2019s team swiftly dismissed it, saying the poll was \u201cnot what we see at all\u201d. But it\u2019s enough to make traders edgy, says Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets: The surge in gold prices and the volatility index is the real reflection that traders have finally woken up to the reality that the US election does represent a significant risk, something they were completely ignorant about until now. European markets are also expected to dip today, says Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a lot coming up this morning, including new data showing how Europe\u2019s factories, and Britain\u2019s builders, fared last month. And later on today, the US central bank will end its two-day monetary policy meeting: 9am GMT: Eurozone manufacturing PMI - expected to remain unchanged at 53.3 9.30am GMT: UK Construction PMI - expected to fall to 51.8, from 52.3 6pm: US Federal Reserve - expected to leave US interest rates on hold On the corporate front, the City are getting results from retailer Next, pub chain JD Wetherspoon, housebuilder Persimmon. And Nationwide, the estate agent, have just reported that house price growth stalled last month, pulling the annual rate of house price growth down to 4.6%, from 5.3% in September. We\u2019ll have more on that later...",

The statement comments that \u201dthe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen\u201d while adding the word \u201csome\u201d to the line that it wants to \u201cwait for SOME further evidence of continued progress towards its objectives\u201d. This all suggests that things are moving in the right direction, but the Presidential election is an obvious reason for waiting.</p> <p>Assuming Clinton wins, markets are likely to react with relief given expectations of policy continuity. This, coupled with the reasonably firm growth, rising employment and a gradual pick-up in inflation should reinforce market expectations for a December rate hike. Should Trump win then this is likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually do when in power. It is hard to imagine the Fed hiking in this environment. We also have plenty more data to come ahead of the December 14 FOMC meeting, including two more job reports so there are other reasons for caution.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Fed statement has failed to give much support to the dollar, and US markets have struggled for direction after the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 33 points, compared to around 70 ahead of the statement. The US dollar index has lost 0.3% to 97.38.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

Combined with a slump in oil prices following a record weekly rise in US crude stocks, this has pushed markets in Europe sharply lower.</p> <p>But on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lost 100 points or so on Tuesday, has not been hit as badly (so far), and is currently down just 20 points ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve interest rate decision.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile the Vix index of volatility, seen as a gauge of investor fears, is up 3% to 19. When Clinton looked a shoo-in to win, the index was hovering around 13. But despite this recent rise, it is still well below the 25 level it reached after the Brexit vote in June. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Less than a week out from the US election and markets are demonstrating both complacency and a palpable fear at the same time. A surge in the VIX index shows volatility is on the rise and investors are hedging equity exposure with safe havens like gold and government bonds.

Over that same period the FTSE 100 and S&amp;P 500 are down 2-3%. </p> <p>There is still a general perception that Hillary Clinton will take the White House, but the surprise Brexit result is fresh in minds of investors and they are buying gold and VIX index tracking products to hedge their bets.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 71.72 points or 1.04% to 6845.42, its lowest level since 27 September</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.47% to 10,370.93</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.24% at 4414.67</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 2.51% lower at 16,474.52</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.85% at 8873.4</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 581.56.</strong></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a0f8ee4b029b92ca44c77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T16:12:51.686Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision in a couple of hours and the Bank of England meeting tomorrow, the dollar continues to weaken against the pound.</p> <p>Jitters about the prospect of Donald Trump winning the White House have sent the US currency lower, to the benefit of sterling which is now up 0.57% at $1.2313, a three week high.</p> <p>The pound is not faring so well against the euro but nor is it losing ground, being pretty much unchanged at \u20ac1.1078.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a0bc3e4b07ceadb3a1abb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T15:52:41.324Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with oil:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/chris1reuters/status/793836490023460865\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Back to Algiers<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brent?src=hash\">#Brent</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WTI?src=hash\">#WTI</a> crude <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/oil?src=hash\">#oil</a> have now lost all gains made after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPEC?src=hash\">#OPEC</a> agreed output limits with other producers Sept 28<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OOTT?src=hash\">#OOTT</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/xb3NZzdBKN\">pic.twitter.com/xb3NZzdBKN</a></p>&mdash; Christopher Johnson (@chris1reuters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chris1reuters/status/793836490023460865\">November 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-581a09fae4b07ceadb3a1aae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T15:48:40.140Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Global manufacturing grew at the fastest rate for two years in October, according to data from purchasing managers surveys in more than 30 countries.</strong></p> <p>The JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI, compiled by Markit, rose to 52 in October form 51 the previous month, its highest since October 2014.

Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The markets are not in full on panic mode right now, suggesting that they still think Clinton could clinch a win next week. This is reflected in the Vix volatility index, which is considered a fear gauge for Wall Street. Even though it has risen in recent days it is still below 20%, to put this in context, after the Brexit vote in June volatility spiked above 25%.</p> <p>Global stock markets are generally lower on Wednesday, but US markets have outperformed their European counterparts even with 6 days to go before the US election. Interestingly, the Dow Jones Transport Index, considered a lead indicator for Wall Street, is higher today. Considering a Trump presidency is considered the worst outcome for the US economy, the fact that this index has not fallen further on the back of the bad poll news for the Clinton camp, suggests that the US equity market may not sell off sharply until volatility spikes further, or until the actual result is confirmed.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the other potentially market moving event is the US Federal Reserve interest rate announcement later. Brooks said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The market is expecting a 14% chance of a hike tonight. If the Fed does hike, that would throw the cat among the pigeons, and we could see a steeper sell off in equities, a rally in bond yields and a broad-based recovery in the dollar.</p> <p>However, in our view the bigger risk from today\u2019s meeting could be a dovish slant from the Federal Reserve, who may not want to commit to a rate hike until the election result is confirmed. Although the Fed is expected to be politically neutral, a potential market sell-off on the back of a win for Trump next week could put the prospect of a December rate hike to bed for the Fed. Added to this, the Fed chair and vice chair have given speeches with fairly dovish slants in recent weeks, so a sell-off in the dollar on Wednesday could be in advance of a dovish \u201cshock\u201d from the Fed later on today.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5819fcc5e4b029b92ca44c01\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-02T14:48:42.158Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/793825218724782080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">$50 fading fast.

The report by the Public Policy Projects notes that patients, taxpayers and drugmakers benefit from a shared clinical trials and drug approvals process between the UK and the EU. This would be lost under a hard Brexit, which could mean years of delays before vital new drugs come on to the UK market \u2013 and \u00a3144bn of lost sales for the UK life sciences industry by 2020. A hard Brexit would mean the UK having no access to the single market. Stephen Dorrell, a former Tory health secretary who heads the thinktank, said the government must be equally focused on Brexit\u2019s implications for the pharmaceutical and biotech industries as it was on banking and the car industry. Life sciences contribute \u00a360bn a year to the UK economy and employ 220,000 people. Dorrell, who also chairs the NHS Confederation, warned that a hard Brexit would \u201ctake ourselves out of the scientific mainstream and thereby undermine the vitality of the British life sciences\u201d. The UK life sciences, which David Cameron described as a \u201cjewel in the crown\u201d, risked being demoted to a \u201csecond-tier player\u201d, Dorrell added. The report, backed by healthcare consulting firm QuintilesIMS, argues that access to the single market is vital for drugmakers, ensuring free movement of scientists and preventing a brain drain. It says students should be taken out of the migration count. Theresa May\u2019s government has promised to make good the loss of the \u20ac8.8bn (\u00a37.9bn) in scientific funding the UK received from the EU last year. But Dorrell said it was just as important to ensure that UK science remained at the heart of the European scientific community. Luke Tryl, author of the report, said: \u201cIf we were to put [UK research and development] at risk, that would be highly reckless.\u201d The pro-EU group Scientists for EU says it knows of 41 foreign researchers who have refused to take UK posts or are thinking of refusing because of the Brexit vote, and of 100 who have already left or are planning to leave Britain. There have also been incidents of British scientists being dropped from EU projects owing to funding concerns. The report highlights the importance of regulatory alignment. Tryl said if UK drugmakers were forced to choose between launching medicines in the UK and the EU, they would choose the latter market with its 500 million consumers rather than the former with its 60 million. The report points to Switzerland, noting that the Swiss authorisation agency works closely with the European Medicines Agency under mutual recognition agreements. Another blow would come from pharmaceutical companies relocating. Japan\u2019s drugmakers \u2013 at least 18 have R&amp;D operations in the UK \u2013 have already warned they would move to wherever the EMA, currently based in London, relocates.

Domestic consumer confidence, which was tentative at the start of the year and shaken further by the referendum outcome, is also starting to steady as we gear up for Christmas.\u201d He said Oxford Street\u2019s first traffic-free shopping day in four years on Sunday, when singer Craig David will flick on the Christmas lights, would also help lift sales. But Tyrrell predicts the proportion of shoppers visiting London\u2019s main high streets will drop by 3.1%, after a 2.7% fall last year, as more people choose to buy online. Continued uncertainty about Brexit is also likely to affect consumer and business confidence over the next the two years, according to Tyrrell. West End retailers will need to find an additional \u00a3124m in tax next year as the business rate revaluation, the apprenticeship levy and the \u201cnational living wage\u201d come into force. These changes are expected to hit West End profits by up to 25%. \u201cRetailers will need to generate significantly increased sales to keep up with the hikes,\u201d Tyrrell said.",

      "bodyText": "My friend Phillip Lowe, who has died aged 76, believed passionately in the importance of manufacturing in Britain. As managing director and then chairman of Yorkshire Chemicals (1984\u201396), he both increased sales of its highly specialised dyestuffs and profits from them, and took a progressive view of the desirability of empowering the workforce. Blue-collar and white-collar employment conditions were harmonised at the firm. Clocking-on \u2013 registering arrival times with cards in machines \u2013 was abolished, profit-sharing and share option schemes were introduced, pension provisions were made equal and free private medical insurance was introduced for all. These measures, together with substantial investment in new plant, stimulated the company\u2019s growth, with more than 90% of sales made outside the UK. Born in Oldham, Lancashire, Phillip was one of the six children of Dorothy (nee Townsend) and Harry Lowe. His father was a mule stringer, whose arduous work involved tending to the machines known as mules in a cotton mill, and Phillip would sometimes act as his helper. He and his siblings benefited greatly from the provisions of the postwar welfare state. Phillip was educated at Chadderton grammar school and at Leeds University, graduating in 1961. He then taught in secondary and further education before joining the Textile Council in Manchester. In 1969 he co-authored a study of the future of the British cotton and allied textiles industry for the government. He became chief economist of the textiles and garments group Carrington Viyella in 1973, and later entered its general management. Phillip joined the board of Yorkshire Chemicals as commercial director in 1981. I first met him when I became his personal assistant after he was appointed managing director. Phillip was a fair, hardworking and competent businessman and I enjoyed working alongside him during a period of immense change at the company. He was appointed OBE in 1997 for services to the UK chemical industry. Phillip married Patricia Booth in 1962, and they had two children, Anne Marie and Andrew. Following Patricia\u2019s death from cancer, Phillip married Margaret Nightingale, in 1996. In 2006, Phillip and Margaret moved from Hillam, in North Yorkshire, to Anglesey. There, Phillip was involved in community life, chauffeuring members of the WRVS to the lunch club in Beaumaris, and visiting two local care homes once a month to sing with the residents. He was also an active member of his village church. In 2015, he and Margaret moved back to North Yorkshire, to the Hollins Hall retirement village, in Hampsthwaite. He is survived by Margaret, Anne Marie and Andrew, and by four grandchildren.",

These individuals became customers of debt purchase and collections firm Motormile Finance UK, which has agreed to write off \u00a3414m of debt after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) criticised the way it was pursuing people for the sums it said they owed. Motormile, which also trades as MMF, MMF Debt Purchase and MMF UK, describes itself as \u201cone of the leading debt purchase companies in the UK,\u201d and specialises in buying up old payday loans and other debts, and then attempting to recover this money. According to consumer website forums, the company has bought payday loans from a number of lenders including Cash Genie, Peachy, Mr Lender, Lending Stream, Swift Sterling, WageDayAdvance and PoundsTillPayday.co.uk. It is also understood to have bought car finance loans. The FCA said that after buying debts, the company failed to carry out the necessary \u201cdue diligence\u201d to make sure the sums of money that were said to be owed were correct. It added: \u201cThis in turn led to unfair and unsuitable customer contact for recovery of those sums.\u201d A redress programme has now been set up, affecting more than 500,000 people. The vast majority \u2013 who typically received a letter or email saying that the debt had been passed to Motormile \u2013 will see their debts written off.

A total of \u00a3154,000 is being repaid to 2,148 people, which averages about \u00a372 per person.

Denise Crossley, chief executive officer at Motormile, said: \u201cWe apologise to all affected customers and are delighted that we are able to address the issues through the redress scheme we have agreed with the FCA.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s top companies should bring to an end all-white boardrooms by 2021, a government-backed review into ethnic diversity has recommended. A report led by Sir John Parker, chairman of mining giant Anglo American, said the UK\u2019s largest firms are failing to promote sufficient numbers of people from ethnic minorities to senior positions. He concluded that every company listed on the FTSE 100 should have at least one non-white director by 2021. For FTSE 250 companies, the deadline should be 2024. The proportion of non-white people on UK FTSE 100 boards is currently at about 8%, compared with 14% of the overall population in the UK. Only nine non-white people hold the top positions of chair or chief executive. \u201cThe boardrooms of Britain\u2019s leading public companies do not reflect the ethnic diversity of either the UK or the stakeholders that they seek to engage and represent,\u201d Parker said. \u201cThis report highlights that ethnic minority representation in the boardrooms across the FTSE 100 is disproportionately low, especially when looking at the number of UK citizen directors of colour. \u201cWe believe that in order for corporate Britain to reflect the progress that is being made in diversity, equality and inclusion generally, changes are needed in the boardrooms where leadership, stewardship and corporate ethics are of utmost importance.\u201d Parker was appointed to head the review of ethnic diversity in boardrooms in 2014 by the then-business secretary Sir Vince Cable. It followed the Davies review, which recommended in 2011 that FTSE 100 companies should double the proportion of women in boardrooms to 25% by 2015. The target was exceeded, with women accounting for 26.1% of FTSE 100 boards last year. The draft proposals in the report titled Beyond one by \u201921, are now out for consultation until 28 February 2017, with final recommendations to follow. Responding to the report on Wednesday, the deputy director general of business lobby group the CBI, Josh Hardie, said the recommendations were an ambitious but practical way to make progress on an important issue. Hardie added: \u201cIncreasing ethnic representation on boards is not only the right thing to do, it improves business\u2019s performance by bringing together people with a variety of ideas and experiences to make better business decisions. \u201cUltimately, attracting and promoting talent from all backgrounds helps us to build inclusive and productive workplaces, in which everyone feels engaged and able to perform at their best.\u201d",

The ratings agency downgraded the outlook on the UK sovereign rating to negative from stable on 24 June, the day after the referendum.

In a report published on Wednesday, the agency said the UK\u2019s medium-term outlook was weaker than it would have been if Britain had voted to remain part of the EU, but the scale of the impact would depend on the type of trade agreement it manages to strike in Europe. Muehlbronner said: \u201cThe UK will have to handle multiple, complicated policy decisions in areas including global trade, immigration and regulation. Given the magnitude and complexity of these decisions, the risk is material that some might damage the UK\u2019s economic or fiscal strength.\u201d Moody\u2019s said its negative outlook for the UK banking system reflected \u201cBrexit-induced uncertainties\u201d, which had placed pressure on the revenues, asset quality and profitability of all UK banks.

But easyJet is bucking the trend, up 30.5p to 971p as it settled a dispute with its pilots and HSBC analysts double upgraded from reduce to buy. HSBC said the airline had a strong strategic position and would benefit from fuel price improvements next year. Its shares had lost around 45% so far this year after warning on trading, particularly in the wake of the Brexit vote. HSBC also raised its rating on Ryanair, up 1.5% to \u20ac12.93, from reduce to hold and said: Next year Ryanair and easyJet will benefit from significant fuel price improvements, in contrast to their low cost competitors, whose fuel hedging has seen the benefit from falling market prices sooner. Ryanair and easyJet remain the long-term strategic winners in the market with solid strategic positions and strong balance sheets. Despite easyJet\u2019s current short-term commercial and operational challenges, we continue to see it as one of the two market leaders. Meanwhile Next is up 230p to \u00a350.40 after the retailer maintained its full year profit forecast at \u00a3805m, helped by cost savings and despite tough trading conditions. The news helped lift peer Marks &amp; Spencer by 7.5p to 349.7p. Overall however, the FTSE 100 has fallen 25.30 points to 6891.84. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A fresh batch of pre-US election jitters has swept the markets this morning, investors fretting over news that Trump has taken the lead in a national poll. While Clinton is still ahead in the majority of surveys, the fact that the orange-faced Republican nominee has clawed his way back to being a potential victor in the aftermath of the FBI email scandal has sent a wave of fear through first the Asian markets, and now the European open. Investors are also cautious ahead of the latest Federal Reserve statement later, even though most pundits expect the central bank to keep rates unchanged as the election looms. A warning from Moody\u2019s that it would downgrade the UK\u2019s sovereign rating if it lost access to the single market has not helped matters. Standard Chartered is leading the fallers, down 25.2p to 648.1 after Tuesday\u2019s disappointing update. Mining shares are also under pressure on growth concerns, with Glencore down 6.8p at 239.65p and Antofagasta falling 12.5p to 540.5p. But precious metal specialists have moved higher as gold and silver continue to be seen as havens for nervous investors. Randgold Resources has risen 130p to \u00a375.25 and Fresnillo is up 35p to \u00a317.53. Persimmon has put on 20p to \u00a317.57 as the housebuilder said sales were upu 19% since July despite the Brexit vote, but said it would be more cautious about land buying as the UK begins talks to leave the EU. Among the mid-caps G4S has climbed 17.5p to 237.6p following an announcement that nine month revenues had risen 5.7%. But pubs group JD Wetherspoon is down 50.5p at 837.5p as it warned of higher costs in terms of wages and rates, and said sales had slowed in the UK and Ireland. Pro-Brexit chairman Tim Martin also hit out at European leaders over the leave negotiations.",

Tim Martin accused Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, of putting unfair pressure on European firms to be hostile to UK trading partners, and said Britain was in a stronger position than people think. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Wetherspoon or British buyers are in a weak position because we can switch from Swedish cider to British cider. So the people put in a weak position are the sellers and I think that is the paradox that has not been illustrated. The UK is in a much more powerful position than most economists would assume.\u201d Martin said the German leader Angela Merkel and the French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande were supportive of Juncker and the idea that the UK must pay a price for voting to leave the EU. He added: \u201cAccording to press reports, Juncker told European business leaders in October not to negotiate with UK companies and to adopt an intransigent attitude. I would not advise any EU companies to follow that advice. \u201cIf we, and companies like ours, are unable to agree on tariff-free transactions, it will inevitably result in a loss of business for European companies which have done nothing to deserve this outcome. \u201cThe ultimate sanction will be in the hands of UK consumers, should they take offence at the hectoring and bullying approach of Juncker and co. French wine, champagne and spirits, German beer and Swedish cider, for example, are all at extreme risk.\u201d Martin was an active supporter of the Brexit campaign in the runup to the 23 June referendum and since the vote he has criticised the political and economic establishment for doom-laden predictions about the impact of a vote to leave the EU that he says have turned out to be false. The Wetherspoon chairman made the latest comments in a trading update for the first quarter ending 23 October. Like-for-like sales over the period increased by 3.5%, and total sales were up 2.3%. Like-for-like sales strip out the impact of pubs open for less than a year. Wetherspoon said that trading had slowed in recent weeks, adding that its wages bill, business rates, and repairs costs were all expected to rise in the remainder of the year. Martin said: \u201cThe company has made a reasonable start in the current year, but any forecasts for the full year are inevitably tentative, with nine months still to go \u2013 and the outlook for the current financial year is unchanged.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Powers granted by the Queensland government for Adani\u2019s proposed Carmichael mine are unprecedented for a private commercial development, new findings reveal. Legal analysis by the Environmental Defenders Office in Queensland provided exclusively to Guardian Australia ahead of its public release on Thursday shows that the broad powers have previously applied only to essential endeavours. Anthony Lynham, the state minister for natural resources and mines, declared the Carmichael mine and its associated infrastructure a \u201cprescribed project\u201d and \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d on 7 October. There has been only a handful of critical infrastructure declared since laws enabling it were introduced to the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act in 2006. Most of the five relate to water supply. Most notably, in 2007, the then infrastructure minister declared parts of the water grid in south-east Queensland critical infrastructure because that region was experiencing unprecedented drought. Jo-Anne Bragg, chief executive of the Environmental Defenders Office Queensland, said the use of a declaration power \u201clargely designed to protect Queensland from the worsening effects of drought\u201d for the Adani Carmichael combined project was \u201cdeeply inappropriate\u201d. At the time of the declaration Lynham told the Sunday Mail: \u201cThis is a critical project. The government is serious about seeing it happen. We have to get jobs happening for central and northern Queensland.\u201d Under the law governing critical infrastructure, the coordinator general may speed up or progress assessment and, with ministerial consent, step in and take control of any legal decision still required for the project to proceed. At that point opportunities for the community to interrogate the impacts of the project on groundwater may be limited. The Queensland courts are also stripped of their usual statutory powers to review and determine the lawfulness of any decisions that might be made by the coordinator general. Bragg said this meant the critical infrastructure declaration \u201ccould be used to potentially short-circuit legal protection for vital groundwater resources\u201d. \u201cWe believe the provision has been wrongly used in its application to the Adani project, and believe this could open the floodgates to all manner of major private developments demanding to be fast-tracked through the assessment process,\u201d she said. She recommended that the state government revoke both declarations to assure Queenslanders that proper procedure would be followed, and for the State Development Act to be amended to constrain the broad powers of the coordinator general in future. The Environmental Defenders Office\u2019s analysis found that the Adani coal project was assessed faster than the average time taken for major coordinated projects in Queensland. A review of the Queensland government\u2019s \u201ccoordinated projects\u201d website showed that the average time between the lodgment of an initial advice statement by a proponent and the delivery of a coordinator general report was four to five years. In the case of the Carmichael mine only three and a half years passed between Adani lodging the initial advice statement for the project and the delivery of the coordinator general\u2019s report. \u201cDespite the size and impact of the Adani mine, the proposal has passed through the process in less time than an average comparable project,\u201d Bragg said. \u201cThe government needs to stop bowing to industry pressure and instead ensure that the impacts on our precious and irreplaceable groundwater resources are thoroughly scrutinised.\u201d A spokeswoman for the coordinator general\u2019s office confirmed to Guardian Australia that the Adani mine was the first commercial project to be determined critical infrastructure. Asked why it merited these powers, and whether its approval was fast-tracked in any way, she referred to the statement put out by Lynham at the time of the announcement.",

      "bodyText": "Next lowered its annual sales forecast following a tough third quarter when the retailer struggled to sell full-price clothing. The company said a bigger than usual end-of-season sale in July, as well as stronger trading a year earlier, had affected its performance in August and September. Sales fell 3.5% in the third quarter. \u201cIn September, we gave guidance that trading in the third quarter would be difficult. In August, full-price sales were subdued following the much larger end-of-season sale in July, and in September we traded against our best month last year. October sales improved significantly, as comparative weeks last year became less challenging.\u201d Next was one of the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest risers in early trading, with shares up 2.2%. Lord Wolfson, Next\u2019s chief executive, had previously warned that the retailer had seen no post-referendum recovery in sales and that trading remained difficult. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said there was relief that the trading update was not more gloomy. He said: \u201cAhead of the much-awaited third quarter update from mighty Next, the City has grown nervous about what the company would say, despite the evidence of much improved October trading, on the back of colder weather. The issue is how bad August and September were and so it is some sort of relief that overall full-price sales were only 3.5% down in the period.\u201d Next lowered its guidance for full-price sales in the year to January 2017, predicting a drop of 1.75% in the worst-case scenario, and a 1.25% increase in the best-case scenario. The fashion retailer said it expected pre-tax profit to be between \u00a3785m and \u00a3825m, compared with a previous range of between \u00a3775m and \u00a3845m. Freddie George, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: \u201cThe brand is, in our view, not broken even if it has lost its edginess against some of the mainstream competitors. It is being impacted by a more competitive and difficult market, which we had expected would have been more robust in the lead-up to Christmas.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The combined budget deficit of commonwealth, state and territory governments is growing, thanks in part to an increase in infrastructure spending, new figures show. The Parliamentary Budget Office released its national fiscal outlook on Wednesday, running the ruler over the latest commonwealth, state and territory budgets, and mid-year budget updates, to reveal the size of government debt and deficit. Looking at the years between 2015-16 and 2018-19, it says the projected national deficit in those years will be $14.9bn worse than expected. This means the national deficit is likely to be $137.1bn by 2018-19, rather than $122.3bn. It says the $14.9bn \u201cdeterioration\u201d between 2015-16 and 2018-19 is due to large falls in projected revenue ($18.1bn) and an increase in net capital investment ($2.8bn), partially offset by a decrease in expenses ($6bn). It also says 60% of that deterioration is due to a downward revision of $8.9bn in the projected balance of the federal budget. \u201cThe downward revision primarily reflects lower forecast wages growth which is forecast to reduce individuals and other withholding taxes,\u201d the report says. As a consequence, the PBO says national debt is projected to rise to $428.5bn (22.6% of gross domestic product) in 2018-19. That is compared with $397.6bn (20.8% of GDP) at the time the 2015-16 mid-year budget updates were delivered. The PBO says national debt is now projected to plateau at $428.8bn in 2019-20. The vast majority of that increase in national net debt lies with the commonwealth government. Commonwealth net debt is projected to increase to $356.4bn (18.8% of GDP) in 2018\u201319, compared with the 2015\u201316 mid-year budget update estimate of $346.6bn (18.2% of GDP). The PBO says that as a proportion of GDP, commonwealth net debt is projected to peak at 19.2% of GDP in 2017\u201318, before improving to reach 17.8% of GDP by 2019\u201320. It says there has been a deterioration in the state budgets for New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland. But the projected increase in NSW\u2019s budget deficit since its mid-year update was mainly driven by a \u201csignificant increase in infrastructure investment\u201d, particularly in rail projects and justice facilities. It said this was funded, in part, from the proceeds from the long-term lease of Transgrid (the state-owned electricity transmission network) which were included in the mid-year fiscal update. It said the projected increase in WA\u2019s budget deficit since its 2015\u201316 mid-year update was primarily driven by a decrease in the tax revenue that can be collected by the state. WA has slower forecast employment and wages growth (reducing payroll tax) and a decline in expected property market activity (reducing transfer duty). The amount of money the state receives from the commonwealth was also predicted to be lower than in the mid-year update, reflecting a reduced share of GST collections for WA. The projected increase in Queensland\u2019s budget deficit was driven by a combination of new policy initiatives, lower royalty revenue and increased infrastructure investment in the latter half of the forward estimates, the PBO said.",

    "webTitle": "Brexit vote will lead to cut in disposable incomes in 2017, says thinktank", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British households can expect a cut in their disposable incomes next year as the knock-on effects of the vote to leave the European Union send inflation rocketing and weaken the outlook for the economy. The government\u2019s freeze on tax credit payments will also play a part in dragging down real disposable incomes for the first time in four years, according to forecasts by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). Revealing a worsening outlook after the collapse in the pound and slump in business investment, the NIESR\u2019s forecasts showed the UK suffering a huge aftershock from the Brexit vote that \u201ccould still lead to a recession\u201d. The thinktank warned that the 0.5% reversal in real household disposable incomes in 2017 would hurt the wider economy, pushing down GDP growth to 1.4% from the 2% the UK is expected to enjoy this year. The NIESR\u2019s quarterly health check came as the CBI business lobby group cut its forecast for GDP growth next year from 2% to 1.3%. The CBI said average wages would continue to increase next year, rising by 2.8% compared to this year\u2019s 2.6%, but soaring inflation would more than wipe out the gains, hitting consumer incomes. Three weeks before the chancellor, Philip Hammond, delivers his first autumn statement, Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist, said businesses were on the lookout for tax incentives to boost investment. She said: \u201cCertainty and stability, vital ingredients that allow businesses to invest and create jobs across the UK, have been absent since the vote to leave the European Union. \u201cNow, with the economic outlook tempered, business leaders will be looking to the chancellor to incentivise investment and instil confidence when he delivers his autumn statement.\u201d The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said workers should be shielded from bearing the brunt of rising prices, after the prime minister, Theresa May, pledged in her speech to the Conservative conference to protect families who were \u201cjust managing\u201d. \u201cA fall in growth would leave workers paying the price through fewer jobs and lower wages,\u201d O\u2019Grady said. The NIESR said that per capita disposable income, which measures the combined incomes from wages and benefits of all households, will fall by 0.5% next year, mainly in response to a forecast jump in consumer price index (CPI) inflation to 3.9%, almost double the rate targeted by the Bank of England. The higher-than-expected inflation rate will dwarf rising average incomes, which will be dragged down by a cap on public sector wages, a freeze on in-work benefits and lacklustre private sector wage rises next year. A spike in inflation is expected following the slump in sterling, which is beginning to push up the cost of imported goods. A report by Merrill Lynch forecast a further slump in the pound in early 2017 to $1.15, from $1.22, which it predicted would further raise import prices and push inflation even higher. Analysts at the investment bank said investors had failed to judge the impact of the government\u2019s intention to trigger article 50 by March 2017, which will mark the beginning of negotiations with Brussels and generate \u201ca frequent and potentially contradictory Brexit news flow\u201d. The NIESR said it forecast a rise in inflation to almost 4% next year after is assumed the pound would stabilise against the dollar following an 18% fall since the referendum. A further tumble in the exchange rate could push inflation even higher. Simon Kirby, an NIESR economist, said: \u201cThe depreciation of sterling has been the most striking feature of the post-referendum economic landscape. This will pass through into consumer prices over the coming months and quarters. \u201cBy the end of 2017 we expect CPI to have reached almost 4%. While we expect this to be only a temporary phenomenon, it will nonetheless weigh on the purchasing power of consumers over the next couple of years.\u201d Consumer spending has propped up GDP growth in the last year after a sharp downturn in construction and weaker manufacturing sector, which has lost momentum in response to slowing growth in global trade. The most recent assessment of the UK economy by the Office for National Statistics showed that manufacturing contracted in the three months to the end of September by 1%. A survey of manufacturers in October found that the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum had helped to increase exports, but also forced manufacturers to raise the price of their goods at the fastest rate in more than five years. The latest Markit/CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) survey for October suggested that firms are starting to pass on higher import costs as the weak pound makes raw materials such as oil more expensive. Prices of everyday items including clothing, wine, bread and fruit are expected to come under increasing pressure as Brexit nears. However, the weak exchange rate also helped to boost orders from the US, the EU and China. Rob Dobson, a senior economist at IHS Markit and an author of the report, said the manufacturing sector should return to growth in the fourth quarter.",

While we expect this to be only a temporary phenomenon, it will nonetheless weigh on the purchasing power of consumers over the next couple of years.\u201d</p> <p>Consumer spending has propped up GDP growth in the last year after a sharp downturn in construction and weaker manufacturing sector, which has lost momentum in response to slowing growth in global trade.</p> <p>The most recent assessment of the UK economy by the Office for National Statistics showed that manufacturing contracted in the three months to the end of September by 1%. A survey of manufacturers in October found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/pound-completes-worst-four-day-performance-since-brexit-vote\">the sharp fall in the value of the pound</a> since the EU referendum had helped to increase exports, but also forced manufacturers to raise the price of their goods at the fastest rate in more than five years.</p> <p>The latest Markit/CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) survey for October suggested that firms are starting to pass on higher import costs as the weak pound makes raw materials such as oil more expensive. Prices of everyday items including clothing, wine, bread and fruit are expected to come under increasing pressure as Brexit nears. However, the weak exchange rate also helped to boost orders from the US, the EU and China.<br></p> <p>Rob Dobson, a senior economist at IHS Markit and an author of the report, said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/manufacturing-sector\">manufacturing sector</a> should return to growth in the fourth quarter.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Forget suppers of heat-and-eat pizza washed down with a glass or two of red wine. In 2017 Britons will be snacking on Hawaiian raw fish salad and American-style vegetable yoghurts while quenching their thirst with watermelon juice. The predicted new eating trends are contained in an annual survey of how Britons shop, eat and cook which lists the food fads of 2016 as churros, seeds, seaweed and Asian steamed buns. The report, conducted by Waitrose among shoppers who use all supermarkets, also reveals that a third of those aged 18 to 34 regularly post pictures of their meals on social media. More than 130,000 pictures of food are shared on Instagram every day in the UK, and the survey found that nearly half of consumers make more effort with their cooking if they think a photo of it is likely to be shared. The grocer\u2019s managing director, Rob Collins, said posting pictures of dinners online means that meals have become a form of self-expression, in the same way as \u201cthe clothes people wear, the cars they drive and the music they listen to. Food is today\u2019s hottest social currency. \u201d The survey also highlights the continuing shift in shopping habits. Half of consumers shop two or three times a week, compared with once a week 20 years ago, which has reduced the amount of food thrown away. The fourth annual report, published on Wednesday, is based on millions of transactions in shops and online, bolstered by a poll of 2,000 adults of all ages and supported by sessions with focus groups. Consumers\u2019 interest in creating photogenic dishes such as charred pizzas and grilled steaks, Australian-style \u201cfreakshake\u201d ice-cream desserts and colourful rainbows of \u201cspiralised\u201d vegetables are highlighted in the review. The UK may be in the grip of a national obesity crisis but according to Waitrose, eating healthily has become mainstream \u2013 though consumers appear to have ditched traditional calorie-counting. Instead, shoppers are opting for naturally lighter and fresher food than they did five years ago. An 18% jump in aubergine sales this year, says the supermarket, is the result of shoppers substituting them for \u201ccarbs\u201d such as lasagne sheets or roasting them as \u201cchips\u201d. Healthy chia seeds and grains (including ready-prepared grain bags), coconut flour, cactus water \u2013 a berry-tasting low-sugar alternative to fruit juice \u2013 and seaweed and a \u201cveggan\u201d diet (vegan but including eggs) all emerged as top food trends of 2016. For next year the retailer is tipping more unlikely items such as cold-pressed watermelon juice \u2013 which in the US has the star backing of Beyonc\u00e9, who recently bought a stake in the WTRMLN WTR brand. Vegetable yoghurts flavoured with carrot, beetroot, sweet potato and tomato are also expected to be a big new seller. Sushi could be elbowed aside by Polynesian food \u2013 notably Hawaiian poke, a raw fish salad marinated with lime, soy and sesame. Healthy \u201cgourmet\u201d meal kits \u2013 being developed by Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 are also predicted to be a winner with time-poor consumers who want to try to cook from scratch. Despite their obsession with social media and the appearance of food, Britons have also embraced \u201cconscious\u201d consumption, snapping up wonky or sub-standard vegetables and making better use of freezers to store food. Restaurants are also getting in on the Instagram craze. Rochelle Venables, editor of the Good Food Guide, said photogenic food pulls in diners: \u201cRestaurants today tend to have one dish on the menu that is really Instagrammable and people often go to a specific restaurant just to say they have had that dish.\u201d Going up \u2013 in favour in 2016 Seaweed Churros (Spanish-style doughnuts) Wonky vegetables Cactus water Seeds and grains Charred food Coconut flour Picanha (Brazilian rump steak) \u201cVeggan\u201d diet Bao (Asian steamed) buns What we\u2019ll be eating and drinking in 2017 Watermelon juice: Pop star Beyonc\u00e9 bought a stake in WTRMLN WTR in May \u2013 a drink said to be like sticking a straw into a melon and sipping. It comprises just watermelon flesh and rind plus lemon. Polynesian food: Hawaiian poke \u2013 a raw fish salad marinated with lime, soy and sesame and often served with rice \u2013 is likely to be next year\u2019s must-have snack. Foodie meal kits: Gourmet meal kits with pre-measured, pre-prepared ingredients and even simpler self-assemble \u201cready meals\u201d are together a growing trend. Occasional extreme indulgence: The fact that we\u2019re more likely to eat healthy food gives us the excuse to be self-indulgent. Expect more of the Australian-style \u201cfreakshakes\u201d consisting of a milkshake piled high with other ingredients. Vegetable yoghurt: In the US, product developers have infused the flavours of carrot, beetroot, sweet potato and tomato into yoghurt for a savoury accompaniment \u2013 rather like sour cream. Perfume-inspired cocktails: London\u2019s Cafe Royal teamed up with Givenchy this summer to create 10 fragrance-led cocktails \u2013 a phenomenon Waitrose predicts will take off in the UK next year.",
