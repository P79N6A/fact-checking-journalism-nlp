      "bodyText": "When Jonathan Eddy wanted finance for his Basingstoke-based business, one of the traditional high street banks offered him a competitively priced loan - but then threw in fees that made it too expensive for him to proceed. Eddy, managing director of Asset Advantage, has a clear view why. \"The traditional high street banks have forgotten how to lend,\" he told Vince Cable on Friday on a tour of the Reading office of Aldermore, a new-style bank which came up with a financing deal that suited Eddy. Another businessman, Paul Overfield, director of forklift truck maker Bendi, explained to the business secretary that big banks now wanted the bosses of established businesses - not just start-ups - to put up their homes for security for loans. Cable is accustomed to hearing such views about the big four - Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays - and encouraging so-called challenger banks such as Aldermore to step up lending to the small businesses that he regards as the life blood of the economy. The business secretary said it was \"sad\" and \"worrying\" that the Co-operative Bank was pulling out of new business lending. \"It is very sad and quite worrying really because we are losing competition,\" said Cable. The situation has deteriorated ever since the Cruickshank report a decade ago which found that \"business lending was basically an oligopoly with very high margins and very poor service\", Cable said. \"Some 13 years on the structure of the industry is even more concentrated,\" said Cable. \" Attempts to foster competition are floundering. The Co-op had to pull out of talks to buy 632 branches from Lloyds and the sale of a branch network from the other bailed out bank, RBS, to Santander, also broke down. With both branch networks now destined for stock market flotations, reviving old brand names, Trustee Savings Bank and Williams &amp; Glyn's respectively, Cable said he wanted to ensure they were more committed to business lending. The financial crisis exacerbated the need for competition as competitors pulled out. Phillip Monks, chief executive of Aldermore, cited Irish and Icelandic banks as well as Dutch bank ING. \"They've all cut back on their lending to [small and medium sized business] \u2026 the total supply of finance has diminished,\" said Monks. Aldermore hopes to benefit from financing Cable's business bank which, eventually, aims to hand out \u00a31bn to finance small business growth. The first \u00a3300m of loans are expected in the summer. Cable said some international banks were expressing an interest in coming to the UK, such as the German savings banks Sparkasse. But he remained concerned about the lending strategies of the bailed out banks, even as the debate about how to privatise them takes centre stage after the International Monetary Fund called on George Osborne this week to devise a \"clear strategy\". Loosening lending criteria could be \"in the interests of the wider economy \u2026 but they will argue that the short-term interest of their shareholders are not well served (by doing that)\", he said. Stephen Hester, the RBS boss, recently insisted that the 81% state-owned bank lends more than any other bank and has \u00a320bn available to lend to viable customers. But the British Bankers' Association released data on Friday showing business lending had fallen again in April, the third consecutive month of net repayments and the fifth in six months. Cable said he was not an advocate of a quick sell off of RBS, whose shares are trading at a \u00a314bn loss on the \u00a345bn pumped in by taxpayers. \"We've all agreed that in the long run they [the bailed out banks] should go back into private ownership but particularly in the case of RBS I don't see what the hurry is,\" said Cable. \"The share price is so far below the original acquisition price,\" said Cable. \"And there are issues which anybody wanting to buy bank shares would have to consider \u2013 the question of competition commission referral is still there,\" said Cable. \"There is a legal process \u2026 there is quite a strong possibility that something might happen,\" he said, referring to the recommendation by the Independent Commission on Banking that a competition review should take place in 2015 if competition on the high street had not improved by then. Earlier this month the Office of Fair Trading also said it would take until 2015 to see if measures to make it easier to move current accounts, being introduced in September, would make a big difference to high street banking.",

    "webTitle": "Federal Reserve risks boom and bust as QE dilemma presses", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Say what you mean, and mean what you say. Investors are invariably disappointed in their ceaseless demands of US Federal Reserve chairmen. This week's episode was a classic. First, Ben Bernanke suggested on Wednesday that the time was not right to withdraw \"accommodative\" monetary policy. Then he said the Fed committee could make a decision to reduce its $85bn-a-month quantitative easing programme at the \"next few meetings\" if the economic data warranted such a move. The former remark was good for a 1% gain on the US stock market. The latter comment sent prices into reverse and contributed to the 7% slump in the Nikkei 225 index on Thursday. The fallout continued on Friday as the Japanese stock market fell sharply before recovering. So which is it? Is the Fed getting ready to turn off the taps or was Bernanke teasing? Ambiguity will be always be a weapon in central bankers' arsenal but you had to look extremely hard (probably too hard) to conclude that the Fed's script had changed meaningfully. There is a world of difference between talking in theoretical terms about withdrawing the punch bowl and actually doing so. The strong suspicion here is that the US economic data would have to be excellent before the Fed moves. Why? Well, investors' mini-flap illustrates what an uncertain gamble an exit from QE would be at this time. QE is designed to lift asset prices and thereby prod investors into taking more risk, which in turn is meant to encourage economic growth. But how do you tell when growth is sufficiently robust to withstand a withdrawal of monetary medicine? There is no easy answer. If stock markets were to slump, say, 20% in the absence of QE the Fed might find itself back where it started in terms of stirring risk-taking behaviour and confidence. The temptation for Bernanke will surely be to err on the side of overkill when dishing out cheap money. In doing so, he would only be following the Fed form book, as established by Alan Greenspan. So where do stock markets go from here? The general mood, at least in the City, is that a breather was overdue. A serious short-term fall in share prices looks unlikely. The long term is another matter. Stand-offs don't last forever and an entirely plausible plot is that investors conclude that the Fed's bowl is still spiced with vodka and push share prices much higher. After all, what else is there to buy these days? That's when the danger of a bubble, and a damaging pop, would become real. It is probably not this year's stock market story, but it is a developing story. The eurozone, or some other crisis, could supply the pin. Actually, it's the old story of market rise and fall, as the W-shaped graph of the FTSE 100 index since 2000 illustrates. This time could be different, but probably won't be. The line that jarred in Martin Gilbert's farewell statement after 27 years as chairman was the one about FirstGroup being \"one of the world's great transport groups\". OK, it's true that a quarter of a century of deals and activity has made FirstGroup very big. When Gilbert climbed aboard there were a few buses in Dundee. Now FirstGroup has annual revenues of \u00a37bn from road and rail, has a substantial presence in the US and carries 2.5m passengers a year. It's just that great companies are also meant to be great investments. On that score, FirstGroup is almost back where it started as a public company. The share price on 16 June 1995, soon after flotation, was 141p. Now it's 128p, after peaking above 700p in 2007 \u2013 an exciting ride, but not terribly profitable for those who bought at float and held. There have been dividends, of course, but even that consolation is over for the time being. The dividend was cut to zero alongside this week's bumper 3-for-2 rights issue to raise \u00a3615m. The mistake, as everybody now recognises, was the purchase of US group Laidlaw for $3.5bn (\u00a32.3bn) in cash at the top of the market in 2007. Borrowings still stand at \u00a31.9bn today \u2013 thus the cash call. But, actually, the mistakes kept coming. Having failed to flip Laidlaw's Greyhound bus business, FirstGroup didn't tap shareholders when it had the chance. There were at least two opportunities. First, around 2008, when colder economic winds were blowing but the share price was still near 500p. And, second, in 2011, soon after long-serving chief executive Sir Moir Lockhead retired and was replaced by Tim O'Toole. Instead, the struggle against debt turned into an obsession. Potential buyers of surplus assets saw a distressed seller and FirstGroup couldn't afford to invigorate its UK bus business. The debacle over the west coast mainline franchise (FirstGroup won, and then didn't after Virgin successfully challenged the Department for Transport) was the final straw. The rights issue had to happen \u2013 but should have been launched earlier. In time, a recapitalised FirstGroup may yet reward loyal shareholders. It operates critical assets, and gentler breezes can do wonders for fixed-cost businesses. As a potential recovery stock, it's one to watch. And comebacks do happen. Gilbert is the proof. Wearing his other hat, he is chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management. The survival of the fund manager was in doubt in 2002 but Aberdeen is now a FTSE 100 company with \u00a3200bn under management. If you caught the bottom of Aberdeen's share price, congratulations, you've made a 25-fold return. That's what great looks like. Blimey, that's a lot of shares to sell. Ian Gordon of Investec has been totting up the disposals by directors and senior executives at Standard Chartered this week and comes to a tally of 1.4m shares. His calculations are correct, and at \u00a316-ish a pop, the nine individuals, led by chief executive Peter Sands, shared \u00a322m between them. The sudden rush is caused by the annual flowering of various deferred bonus schemes. Tax has to be paid, so the nine are not \u00a322m richer. But they are quite a bit richer and the interesting point is that the overwhelming majority of the shares were sold outright for cash; the proportions retained were tiny. Standard Chartered says its executives are all above the quotas the bank demands as a personal holding and thus alignment is intact. OK, but the lack of appetite for adding to those holdings is still notable. Gordon, incidentally, thinks Standard Chartered is a buy and thinks the bosses were selling at \"distressed prices\". Do they? Our big banks still have much to prove on the governance front, but they have got one thing right: they have separate chairmen and chief executives. Viewed from the UK, the saga of angst and ego at JP Morgan is baffling. If Jamie Dimon can't bear the idea of having only one job title, regulators should say he has no choice. The \"London whale\" episode, in which the bank lost $6bn (\u00a34bn), raised serious questions about risk management. How can regulators, shareholders and bystanders have confidence that lessons have been learned fully if the chairman and chief executive cannot disagree? Only a third of JP Morgan's shareholders voted for the roles to be split. Others, it is said, were worried that separation might prompt Dimon to quit and that the share price would tumble. Come on, JP Morgan is meant to be a bank, not a one-man show.",

      "body": "<p>Say what you mean, and mean what you say. Investors are invariably disappointed in their ceaseless demands of US Federal Reserve chairmen.</p> <p>This week's episode was a classic. First, Ben Bernanke suggested on Wednesday that the time was not right to withdraw \"accommodative\" monetary policy. Then he said the Fed committee could make a decision to reduce its $85bn-a-month quantitative easing programme at the \"next few meetings\" if the economic data warranted such a move.</p> <p>The former remark was good for a 1% gain on the US stock market. The latter comment sent prices into reverse and contributed to the 7% slump in the Nikkei 225 index on Thursday. The fallout continued on Friday as the Japanese stock market fell sharply before recovering.</p> <p>So which is it? Is the Fed getting ready to turn off the taps or was Bernanke teasing? Ambiguity will be always be a weapon in central bankers' arsenal but you had to look extremely hard (probably too hard) to conclude that the Fed's script had changed meaningfully. There is a world of difference between talking in theoretical terms about withdrawing the punch bowl and actually doing so. The strong suspicion here is that the US economic data would have to be excellent before the Fed moves.</p> <p>Why? Well, investors' mini-flap illustrates what an uncertain gamble an exit from QE would be at this time. QE is designed to lift asset prices and thereby prod investors into taking more risk, which in turn is meant to encourage economic growth. But how do you tell when growth is sufficiently robust to withstand a withdrawal of monetary medicine?</p> <p>There is no easy answer. If stock markets were to slump, say, 20% in the absence of QE the Fed might find itself back where it started in terms of stirring risk-taking behaviour and confidence. The temptation for Bernanke will surely be to err on the side of overkill when dishing out cheap money. In doing so, he would only be following the Fed form book, as established by Alan Greenspan.</p> <p>So where do stock markets go from here? The general mood, at least in the City, is that a breather was overdue. A serious short-term fall in share prices looks unlikely. The long term is another matter. Stand-offs don't last forever and an entirely plausible plot is that investors conclude that the Fed's bowl is still spiced with vodka and push share prices much higher. After all, what else is there to buy these days?</p> <p>That's when the danger of a bubble, and a damaging pop, would become real. It is probably not this year's stock market story, but it is a developing story. The eurozone, or some other crisis, could supply the pin. Actually, it's the old story of market rise and fall, as the W-shaped graph of the FTSE 100 index since 2000 illustrates. This time could be different, but probably won't be.</p> <p>The line that jarred in Martin Gilbert's farewell statement after 27 years as chairman was the one about FirstGroup being \"one of the world's great transport groups\".</p> <p>OK, it's true that a quarter of a century of deals and activity has made FirstGroup very big. When Gilbert climbed aboard there were a few buses in Dundee. Now FirstGroup has annual revenues of \u00a37bn from road and rail, has a substantial presence in the US and carries 2.5m passengers a year.</p> <p>It's just that great companies are also meant to be great investments. On that score, FirstGroup is almost back where it started as a public company. The share price on 16 June 1995, soon after flotation, was 141p. Now it's 128p, after peaking above 700p in 2007 \u2013 an exciting ride, but not terribly profitable for those who bought at float and held. There have been dividends, of course, but even that consolation is over for the time being. The dividend was cut to zero alongside this week's bumper 3-for-2 rights issue to raise \u00a3615m.</p> <p>The mistake, as everybody now recognises, was the purchase of US group Laidlaw for $3.5bn (\u00a32.3bn) in cash at the top of the market in 2007. Borrowings still stand at \u00a31.9bn today \u2013 thus the cash call.</p> <p>But, actually, the mistakes kept coming. Having failed to flip Laidlaw's Greyhound bus business, FirstGroup didn't tap shareholders when it had the chance. There were at least two opportunities. First, around 2008, when colder economic winds were blowing but the share price was still near 500p. And, second, in 2011, soon after long-serving chief executive Sir Moir Lockhead retired and was replaced by Tim O'Toole.</p> <p>Instead, the struggle against debt turned into an obsession. Potential buyers of surplus assets saw a distressed seller and FirstGroup couldn't afford to invigorate its UK bus business.</p> <p>The debacle over the west coast mainline franchise (FirstGroup won, and then didn't after Virgin successfully challenged the Department for Transport) was the final straw. The rights issue had to happen \u2013 but should have been launched earlier.</p> <p>In time, a recapitalised FirstGroup may yet reward loyal shareholders. It operates critical assets, and gentler breezes can do wonders for fixed-cost businesses. As a potential recovery stock, it's one to watch.</p> <p>And comebacks do happen. Gilbert is the proof. Wearing his other hat, he is chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management. The survival of the fund manager was in doubt in 2002 but Aberdeen is now a FTSE 100 company with \u00a3200bn under management. If you caught the bottom of Aberdeen's share price, congratulations, you've made a 25-fold return. That's what great looks like.</p> <p>Blimey, that's a lot of shares to sell. Ian Gordon of Investec has been totting up the disposals by directors and senior executives at Standard Chartered this week and comes to a tally of 1.4m shares.</p> <p>His calculations are correct, and at \u00a316-ish a pop, the nine individuals, led by chief executive Peter Sands, shared \u00a322m between them.</p> <p>The sudden rush is caused by the annual flowering of various deferred bonus schemes. Tax has to be paid, so the nine are not \u00a322m richer. But they are quite a bit richer and the interesting point is that the overwhelming majority of the shares were sold outright for cash; the proportions retained were tiny.</p> <p>Standard Chartered says its executives are all above the quotas the bank demands as a personal holding and thus alignment is intact. OK, but the lack of appetite for adding to those holdings is still notable. Gordon, incidentally, thinks Standard Chartered is a buy and thinks the bosses were selling at \"distressed prices\". Do they?</p> <p> Our big banks still have much to prove on the governance front, but they have got one thing right: they have separate chairmen and chief executives. Viewed from the UK, the saga of angst and ego at JP Morgan is baffling. If Jamie Dimon can't bear the idea of having only one job title, regulators should say he has no choice.</p> <p>The \"London whale\" episode, in which the bank lost $6bn (\u00a34bn), raised serious questions about risk management. How can regulators, shareholders and bystanders have confidence that lessons have been learned fully if the chairman and chief executive cannot disagree?</p> <p>Only a third of JP Morgan's shareholders voted for the roles to be split. Others, it is said, were worried that separation might prompt Dimon to quit and that the share price would tumble. Come on, JP Morgan is meant to be a bank, not a one-man show.</p>",

It may not come as a surprise to you by now that no less than 40% of all the goods and services exported by UK businesses are delivered to euro area countries.

Spreads in sovereign and corporate debt markets have narrowed considerably.

      "bodyText": "Developments in Cyprus where authorities have decided to ease restrictions on capital controls. Helena Smith says: Two days after Central Bank of Cyprus Governor Panicos Demetriades announced that the island would \u201cgradually\u201d relax the capital controls it has been forced to adopt since being bailed out in March, authorities took the step of further easing restrictions on foreign banks. The finance ministry said controls would no longer apply for two major Middle Eastern banks operating on the island. As of today, international clients would be able to make money withdrawals and transfers from Lebanon\u2019s Byblos Bank SAL and Jordan\u2019s Arab Jordan Investment Bank SA, it said. Resident clients in Cyprus, however, will still face restrictions including a \u20ac300 daily cash withdrawal from their accounts. Cypriot authorities implemented the controls fearing a run on the island's banks after the EU and IMF forced depositors with more than 100,000 euro in their accounts to participate in the \u20ac23bn bailout. Addressing the thorny issue earlier this week, Demetriades said relaxing the restrictions could only be done \u201cgradually\u201d \u201cEliminating restrictions too abruptly can lead to disruptive outflows and liquidity problems in the banking sector,\u201d he said in a speech in Nicosia, the island\u2019s divided capital. In a separate speech, the Cypriot finance minister Haris Georgiades said he regarded the restrictions as Cyprus\u2019 biggest short-term problem and pledged that the country would work \u201cto steadily relax\u201d them. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in prolongation\u201d of the controls, he said. Cyprus is the first eurozone country to enforce such restrictions. And on that note it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back next week. Thursday's declines have continued although not at the same pace, as investors remained cautious about the outlook for the continuation of central actions to stimulate the global economy. Here's the closing scores: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 42.45 points or 0.63% lower at 6654.34 (more here on the week's volatile performance) \u2022 Germany's Dax fell 0.56% to 8305.32 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.26% lower at 3956.79 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB dropped 0.66% to 16,896.81 \u2022 Spain's Ibex lost 0.95% to 8264.6 Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 33 points or 0.22%. The Guardian\u2019s news community team are hosting a meet-up event at at the Guardian\u2019s offices at Kings Place in London. The setup will be informal - with drinks and nibbles and a chance to get to know other readers who contribute to our live blogs, followed by a Q&amp;A with the Guardian liveblogging team. Unfortunately we've had to move the day, so it's now taking place on Tuesday June 4th from 6pm to 9pm. If you're interested in attending, please email: james.walsh@guardian.co.uk Going where the streets are - thought to be - paved with gold? From ekathimerini: Some 34,000 Greeks relocated to Germany last year, an increase of 43% compared to 2011 when 23,800 Greeks moved there, according to German government statistics. It is not only Greeks who are increasingly seeking a better life in prosperous Germany but an growing number of people from other debt-hit countries in southern Europe. Last year, 29,000 Spaniards, 42,000 Italians moved to Germany, according to German government statistics. The largest influx, however, was from central Europe, with 176,000 Poles, 116,000 Romanians and 59,000 Bulgarians relocating to various parts of Germany. In total more than a million new immigrants arrived in Germany in 2012, the largest influx since 1995. The average age of the migrants is 32. Despite the better than expected US durable goods figures, Wall Street is joining the downward trend. After half an hour or so or trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average is around 80 points lowere, a 0.5% decline. And elsewhere: \u2022 The FTSE 100 is down 0.74% at 6647 \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 0.54% at 8306 \u2022 France's Cac is down 0.01% at 3966 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is down 0.85% at 16,865 \u2022 Spain's Ibex is down 1.44% at 8224 Portugal is set to meet its deficit targets for this year, its prime minister said earlier, but may need an easing of the bailout terms in 2014. After agreeing a \u20ac78bn bailout in 2011, the country has to reduce its deficit to 5.5% of GDP this year, to 4% in 2014 and 2.5% in 2015. These targets have already been eased in March to take account of Europe's worse than expected recession. Prime minister Passos Coelho told parliament, as reported by Reuters: The government does not rule out that further flexibility of the goals may be required for 2014. Our obligation is to do all in our reach to meet what has been agreed as the preferred target. {But] we have already achieved some flexibility before...and it can't be ruled out that further flexibility may become important for 2014. That's a yes, then. Outgoing governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King said the two sides of the debate on growth vs austerity have exaggerated the difference between their positions. Speaking in Helsinki, King said: What we need is more common sense. This debate has been vastly exaggerated by people who want to make political arguments. His timing is interesting, coming two days after the IMF urged chancellor George Osborne to focus on growth and delay austerity. And on that note, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Bloomberg has (already) got a story up on the US durable goods numbers (see 1.34pm). Alex Kowalski writes: Bookings for commercial aircraft climbed 18.1% last month after slumping 43% in March, today\u2019s report showed. Boeing Co. (BA), the Chicago-based aerospace company, said it received 51 orders last month, up from 29 in March. Excluding the more volatile transportation equipment component, durable orders climbed 1.3%, the first gain in three months. Bookings for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, considered a proxy for business investment in items such as computers, engines and communications gear, increased 1.2% after a 0.9% gain the prior month that was previously reported as a drop. As Joe Weisenthal of Business Insider notes, that is the 6th piece of economic news out of the US that has beaten expectations. US durable goods orders for April are in and they are much better than expected. This is the survey that measures the value of orders placed for relatively long-lasting goods, like cars and TVs. Because consumers hold off from buying these kind of things in a recession, it's a good gauge of consumer confidence. Analysts were expecting a 1.5% increase from the previous month, but they rose 3.3%. That compares with a 6.9% decline in March. Italian consumer confidence dropped unexpectedly in May, reversing a rise in April, as the country remains mired in recession. ISTAT's consumer confidence index dropped to 85.9 in May from 86.3 in April. Reuters reports: Consumer spending has long been an Achilles heel of the Italian economy, which has been the most sluggish in the eurozone for at least a decade. ISTAT reported on Wednesday that people living in families considered to be seriously deprived have doubled in the past two years to 8.6m, or about 14% of the population, as a long recession has eaten into Italians' spending capacity. The EU must allow states to go bankrupt, ECB board member Jens Weidmann says. Newswire MNI has the following lines from his speech in Paris. He says budget consolidation through spending cuts enhances growth, it can support confidence and lead to lower interest rates. By contrast, he says high levels of public debt are bound to hurt growth. Returning to his theme from last night's speech (see 8.59am), he warns that high levels of debt can divert central banks from price stability. And he says anchored inflation expectations do no ensure future stability. On the ECB's outright monetary transactions \u2013 its tool to keep bond yields in check by buying up the bonds of crisis-hit states in the secondary markets \u2013 he says it remains to be seen if the benefits outweigh the risks. The markets have (largely) turned negative again, despite an upbeat German business confidence survey. UK FTSE 100: down 0.7%, or 46 points, at 6651 German DAX: down 0.4% France CAC: up 0.14% Italy FTSE MIB: up 0.05% Spain IBEX: down 0.5% The ECB has posted a link to Mario Draghi's speech last night. He started with a quote to grab the headlines: Europe needs a more European UK as much as the UK needs a more British Europe. Then went on to explain why, with a series of statistics highlighting their interdependency. Among these was the following. The euro area is the UK\u2019s largest export market. It may not come as a surprise to you by now that no less than 40% of all the goods and services exported by UK businesses are delivered to euro area countries. In 2012 this amounted to 240 billion euros, or just short of \u00a3200bn. Draghi sees some reasons to be cheerful. Today we are seeing some encouraging signs of tangible improvements in financial conditions. Spreads in sovereign and corporate debt markets have narrowed considerably. Banks in stressed countries have seen the deposits placed with them by euro area non-banks increasing by about 200 billion euro since August 2012. But, he says, economic conditions remain \"challenging\". He calls for further progress in establishing a Europe-wide banking union, in order to \"sever the link between banks and their respective sovereigns\". It is, he says, \"this link that lies behind the fragmentation in the financial markets of the euro area\". Although he applauds the progress made so far, he says the region must create a Single Resolution Mechanism, to manage the failure of banks within Europe. Draghi says: Such a mechanism, much like the FDIC in the US, could give markets certainty about the ranking of creditors and the procedures that would be followed in the case of a bank resolution. This will benefit all EU members, he says. He concludes with another headline-grabber: The answer to the crisis has not been less Europe but more Europe. This is a time when the strength of all our institutions is being tested; first, by the financial crisis, then by the recession. The European Union and the European Monetary Union are no exceptions. The choice is between adapting them to the new conditions or do nothing and risk their dissolution. Back in the UK, figures on mortgages from the British Bankers' Association point towards a slight increase in house prices this year. The BBA said mortgage approvals rose in April to stand 0.9% higher than a year ago, although net lending fell. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight writes: The rise in mortgage approvals in April reported by the BBA data support belief that house prices are likely to achieve a modest gain of a few per cent or so over 2013, as activity gradually picks up supported by initiatives such as the Funding for Lending Scheme and Help to Buy. However, while a moderate rise in house prices over 2013 looks increasingly probable, a strong upward move still seems unlikely given an ongoing challenging and uncertain economic environment despite the recent signs of moderate improvement. In particular, weak earnings growth and still relatively low and fragile consumer confidence argues against a marked rise in house prices for some time to come. Things are picking up even in beleaguered France. Confidence in the country's manufacturing industry picked up more than expected in May, rising to 92 from 88 the previous month, beating expectations of a reading of 89. But broader business confidence held steady at its lowest level since August 2009. The national statistics office said the broader indicator of overall business confidence remained unchanged at 84. Julien Manceaux at ING writes: All in all, it seems that even if manufacturers remain very downbeat, slowly improving order books and decreasing stocks could finally boost activity in the manufacturing sector in the second half of this year. This in turn could lead to a slow recovery in the service sector, the main provider of jobs and investments, whose activity continues to contract: the PMI for the service sector in May was stable at 44.3, which is much lower than the average it reached in the last quarter of the year when the economy was contracting. Even if today\u2019s data are encouraging, they are no more than the first green shoots for the Ayrault government. Here's Christian Schulz on that upbeat IFO survey out of Germany (see 9.11am) German business confidence rebounded healthily in May from recent setbacks. The soft patch in March and April, when the Italian political stalemate and the chaotic Cyprus bail-out had raised fears of a return of the euro crisis, has dissipated. However, while the assessment of the current situation of the economy jumped to 110.0, almost back to the February peak and indicating healthy growth, businesses remained more cautious about the outlook. He says the wider eurozone should benefit from growing confidence in Germany. German domestic strength is good news for the Euro crisis countries, as it raises the chances that they can capitalise on their regained competitiveness via stronger exports. At the same time, it reduces the pressure on the ECB to do more after the May interest rate cut. Rising PMIs, confidence in France (business confidence rose from 88 to 92 in May) and slightly stronger Eurozone consumer confidence (reported yesterday) add to the brightening picture for the Eurozone. To the serious matter of the great olive oil debacle. Bloomberg is running a story on how olive oil displaced debt at the heart of the European bottleneck. James Neuger reports: It had the same ingredients as Europe\u2019s debt-crisis drama: a battle between north and south, British defiance, media jeering, and murky decision-making starring a cast of unidentified technocrats. The conflict was put to rest yesterday: the European Union decreed that restaurants in its 27-nation market can continue to put refillable olive-oil bottles on tables, dropping a ban that was scheduled to take effect in 2014. A week after a little-known committee endorsed the mandate, EU Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos scuttled it, pledging instead a regulation that \u201ctakes account of the lives of everyone, not only some, to avoid this sort of misunderstanding.\u201d The olive oil caper of 2013 will go down in history along with now-retracted bans on misshapen vegetables and criminal penalties for grocery-store disregard of the metric system as examples of European rules run amok -- even if many tales of EU over-regulation are more fiction than fact. Sticking with Germany, the IFO business confidence survey came in at 105.7, compared with forecasts of 104.5. The boost came from the index that measures sentiment regarding the current economic conditions, which rose to 110, compared with forecasts of 107.2. The business expectations index was unchanged at 101.6. Traders welcomed the release. Bundesbank president and ECB board member Jens Weidmann has said central banks must be wary of guaranteeing the solvency of governments, in case they find themselves unable to control invlation. Also speaking late last night, Weidmann said: If the debt sustainability or solvability of the state appears to be upheld only by the interventions of the central bank, then the central bank is committed to that goal and cannot really deliver on its primary goal of price stability. Financial markets newswire MNI reports: Citing the example of the Bank of Japan, which is buying up 70% of the debt issuance of the government, Weidmann warned that \"monetary policy can be pushed into a very difficult spot\", where it cannot \"free itself from the embrace of fiscal policy.\" \"Once you're in this game, it is very difficult to get out,\" he said. \"And that's why we need solid public finances in Europe!\" Some have come to view monetary policy as a \"sort of silver bullet\" to tackle structural problems that the politicians seem unable to resolve rapidly, Weidmann observed. But unless structural reforms are pursued, there is no reason for the central bank to buy them time. ECB president Mario Draghi called for \"a more European UK\", when he spoke to a City of London audience last night. In a speech at the City of London Corporation, he said: I cannot say which of the two sets of arguments is stronger, the economic or the political ones, neither am I going to enter into a domestic policy debate, but what I can say is that Europe needs a more European UK as much as the UK needs a more British Europe. The speech, which was met with applause, comes as the Conservative party finds itself deeply divided over the issue of Europe. Draghi refrained from making a direct call for the UK to stay in the EU but instead called on European countries to redouble efforts to agree the terms of a banking union, insisting it would benefit \u201call EU members\u201d including the UK. He said: The answer to the crisis has not been less Europe but more Europe. Bank of England policymaker Paul Fisher had a gloomy message this morning, saying the UK economy is likely to remain sluggish for years to come. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: Fears that Britain faces years more weak growth were raised by a leading Bank of England policymaker when he warned that adjustment to the tougher post-crisis climate was only two-thirds to three-quarters complete. Speaking in Cardiff on Friday, Paul Fisher said there had been nothing to compare with the recent sluggish performance of the economy since modern quarterly growth data was first produced in 1955. \"It is as if the different groups within our society \u2013 households, businesses, banks and the government \u2013 have all decided that their future financial positions, on average, will be worse than they thought before the crisis\", said Threadneedle Street's director for markets. Fisher added that the willingness of people to accept cuts in their living standards was explained by their downbeat view of the future. Fisher is one of the three members of the monetary policy committee, who has been pushing the bank to provide additional stimulus to the economy. The German statistics office confirmed this morning that German GDP rose 0.1% in the first quarter, following a 0.7% decline in the last three months of 2012. That means it avoided a recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction) but only just. Growth was driven by private consumption, which rose 0.8% on the previous month, while construction investment dropped 2.1%. Exports were 1.8% lower on the quarter, but still contributed 0.1% to first quarter growth. Carsten Brzeski of ING said: German consumers remain the silent helpers of the economy. Often forgotten, ignored and labelled as had-beens, German consumers have become an important growth driver. In fact, private consumption grew in each since quarter since 1Q 2012. Unfortunately, the positive trend of private consumption is anything but a spending spree and Germans are still unlikely to become a bunch of shopaholics. This means that despite all delight, this morning\u2019s data also hold an inconvenient truth which interdicts any euphoria: without its exports, the German economy is currently only like a sports car without sixth gear. Consumer confidence is, however, rising, suggesting there is more growth in store. The GfK consumer confidence index for June rose to 6.5, its highest level since September 2007, from 6.2 in May. Christian Schulz of Berenberg Bank writes: In 2013, Germany will have to rely largely on domestic demand for growth. With consumption showing signs of strength and some bounce-back in investment after the long winter, the outlook for domestic demand is brightening. The markets have opened and everything is looking a bit brighter today, after Japanese shares stabilised overnight. UK FTSE 100: up 0.24%, or 16 points, at 6713 Germany DAX: up 0.4% France CAC 40: up 0.5% Italy FTSE MIB: up 0.8% Spain IBEX: up 0.6% We've already had the detailed release of German GDP and some consumer confidence numbers \u2013 more on those shortly \u2013 and there's more data out of the eurozone's largest economy later today. German GDP (Q1): 7am German GfK consumer confidence (June): 7am German IFO business sentiment survey (May): 9am Italian consumer confidence (May): 9am ECB's Costa speaks: 9am UK BBA mortgage data (April): 9.30am ECB's Weidmann speaks: 11am Mervyn King speaks on lessons from the crisis: 12.30pm ECB's Constancio speaks: 1.30pm US durable goods orders (April): 1.30pm In the debt markets, we've got the weekly announcements about how much banks have paid back of their cheap LTRO money from the ECB, and the UK is selling \u00a32.5bn of short-term debt. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis. Markets are expected to be calmer this morning after Japan's Nikkei stabilised overnight. Traders in Tokyo had another dramatic day \u2013 with the index swinging wildly from a 3.5% rise to a 3.5% drop at one stage \u2013 but it settled down in the afternoon to close 0.9% higher. We'll be keeping a close eye on the markets and following economic events around the world as the day goes on.",

In the wake of Nomura moving from buy to neutral earlier in the week, Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the retailer from equal weight to underweight. Analyst Geoff Ruddell said:</p> <blockquote> Next has had a fantastic decade, but one founded on great execution and margin expansion, not structural competitive advantage.

With Next shares at all time highs, both absolute and relative, we would switch into <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong>. <br> We may be calling the top too early, but can not justify the valuation here. We see no near-term reason why investors should lose confidence in Next's ability to out-execute peers, so it is possible the shares could re-rate further. However the multiples are already close to 10-year highs, both absolute and relative, so we think the risk reward looks unattractive at these levels. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Marks ended 2.9p higher at 475p, despite Cantor Fitzgerald taking the opposite tack after its results on Tuesday showed a second successive fall in profits as its clothing division outweighed a positive performance from its food business. Freddie George at Cantor issued a sell note and said:</p> <blockquote> At the final results presentation, management sneaked in two significant changes to its general merchandise strategy but has, in our view, downplayed their significance. The company plans to be less promotional with an objective of moving to a structured sale cycle and plans to increase the fashion element in the stores to attract the younger customer. This, in our view, is the right strategy but we believe it is defensive and is unlikely to move profits above the existing five year range. The execution risk is not reflected in the current valuation. </blockquote> <p>Morgan Stanley also put an underweight rating on <strong>Halfords</strong>, down 33.3p at 300p, after the struggling bicycles and car parts retailer slashed its dividend by 35% to invest in a three-year turnaround plan. The news came as full year profits fell by 22% to \u00a372m.</p> <p>New chief executive Matt Davies said on Thursday profits would remain flat for at least two years as the chain invested \u00a3100m in staff training, store revamps and a better online offering. Kate Calvert at Cantor Fitzgerald cut from buy to sell and reduced her target price from 400p to 290p. She said:</p> <blockquote> We had not appreciated the scale of the investment necessary to put the business on a solid footing and correct years of brand underinvestment. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>Morrisons</strong> dipped 1.3p to 280p after a major shareholder, believed to be fund management group Walter Scott sold about 100m shares, equivalent to just over 4% of Morrisons' stock, for a total \u00a3280m. The sale came just days after Morrisons signed a 25-year contract to sell groceries online in partnership with specialist retailer Ocado, a move which has divided opinion.</p> <p><strong>Arm</strong> slipped 9.5p to 985.5p. The chipmaker lost 10% of its value since an investor day on Tuesday, with analysts concerned about increased competition from Intel in the tablet and smartphone markets. Many believe a move by Arm into the server sector may not be enough to make up for any loss of market share elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>International Airlines Group</strong> fell 5.5p to 273p after one of its British Airways Airbus A319 planes was forced into an emergency landing at Heathrow following an engine fire, causing flight delays and cancellations.</p> <p>But <strong>Smiths Group</strong> climbed 20p to \u00a313.55 after the technology company issued an upbeat trading statement yesterday on Friday, with profits for the first nine months ahead of the same time last year. Analysts at Investec raised their price target from \u00a314.25 to \u00a315.</p> <p><strong>Shire</strong>, the pharmaceuticals group often tipped as a takeover target for the likes of America's Bristol-Myers Squibb, added 34p to \u00a321.68.</p> <p><strong>Aberdeen Asset Management</strong> added 4.1p to 479.1p after Berenberg bank began coverage with a buy recommendation.</p> <p>Still with financials, <strong>Close Brothers</strong> fell 84p to \u00a310.06 on profit taking after the investment and banking group unveiled a 4% rise in assets under management and 9% growth in their loan book.</p> <p>Finally, expansion plans by pharmaceutical group <strong>BTG</strong> were well received by investors. The company said it would make two acquisitions, the targeted therapies division of Canada's Nordion for $200m and Ekos, a specialist in blood clot treatment, for up to \u00a3220m.

We see no near-term reason why investors should lose confidence in Next's ability to out-execute peers, so it is possible the shares could re-rate further. However the multiples are already close to 10-year highs, both absolute and relative, so we think the risk reward looks unattractive at these levels. Meanwhile Marks ended 2.9p higher at 475p, despite Cantor Fitzgerald taking the opposite tack after its results on Tuesday showed a second successive fall in profits as its clothing division outweighed a positive performance from its food business. Freddie George at Cantor issued a sell note and said: At the final results presentation, management sneaked in two significant changes to its general merchandise strategy but has, in our view, downplayed their significance. The company plans to be less promotional with an objective of moving to a structured sale cycle and plans to increase the fashion element in the stores to attract the younger customer. This, in our view, is the right strategy but we believe it is defensive and is unlikely to move profits above the existing five year range. The execution risk is not reflected in the current valuation. Morgan Stanley also put an underweight rating on Halfords, down 33.3p at 300p, after the struggling bicycles and car parts retailer slashed its dividend by 35% to invest in a three-year turnaround plan. The news came as full year profits fell by 22% to \u00a372m. New chief executive Matt Davies said on Thursday profits would remain flat for at least two years as the chain invested \u00a3100m in staff training, store revamps and a better online offering. Kate Calvert at Cantor Fitzgerald cut from buy to sell and reduced her target price from 400p to 290p. She said: We had not appreciated the scale of the investment necessary to put the business on a solid footing and correct years of brand underinvestment. Morrisons dipped 1.3p to 280p after a major shareholder, believed to be fund management group Walter Scott sold about 100m shares, equivalent to just over 4% of Morrisons' stock, for a total \u00a3280m. The sale came just days after Morrisons signed a 25-year contract to sell groceries online in partnership with specialist retailer Ocado, a move which has divided opinion. Arm slipped 9.5p to 985.5p. The chipmaker lost 10% of its value since an investor day on Tuesday, with analysts concerned about increased competition from Intel in the tablet and smartphone markets. Many believe a move by Arm into the server sector may not be enough to make up for any loss of market share elsewhere. International Airlines Group fell 5.5p to 273p after one of its British Airways Airbus A319 planes was forced into an emergency landing at Heathrow following an engine fire, causing flight delays and cancellations. But Smiths Group climbed 20p to \u00a313.55 after the technology company issued an upbeat trading statement yesterday on Friday, with profits for the first nine months ahead of the same time last year. Analysts at Investec raised their price target from \u00a314.25 to \u00a315. Shire, the pharmaceuticals group often tipped as a takeover target for the likes of America's Bristol-Myers Squibb, added 34p to \u00a321.68. Aberdeen Asset Management added 4.1p to 479.1p after Berenberg bank began coverage with a buy recommendation. Still with financials, Close Brothers fell 84p to \u00a310.06 on profit taking after the investment and banking group unveiled a 4% rise in assets under management and 9% growth in their loan book. Finally, expansion plans by pharmaceutical group BTG were well received by investors. The company said it would make two acquisitions, the targeted therapies division of Canada's Nordion for $200m and Ekos, a specialist in blood clot treatment, for up to \u00a3220m. It placed 32m shares at 330p each to raise \u00a3106m to help fund the deals. Its shares ended 14.2p higher at 353.7p.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest pawnbroker on Friday warned the collapse in the gold price will knock its profits. H&amp;T, the largest British high street gold buyer, warned that every 10% fall in the price of gold would wipe about \u00a32m off its pre-tax profits. The stock market warning sent the company's shares tumbling more than 11% on Friday to 224p. Pawnbrokers have been surfing on the wave of soaring gold prices for the last few years with TV adverts and websites encouraging consumers to cash in their jewellery. But gold has lost almost a fifth of its value so far this year as some investors lose faith in the metal as a safe haven. Gold was trading at $1386 an ounce on Friday, significantly below the $1,600 an ounce price when H&amp;T last updated investors. The company, which trades in 186 shops and a further 24 pop-up \"GoldBar\" kiosks in shopping centres, made a \u00a312m profit from buying and selling gold last year, buying up more than \u00a340m of gold from customers and selling it on for \u00a352m. Those profits were down from \"super-normal\" profits of \u00a317m in 2011, when it benefited from the \"rising gold price environment\". H&amp;T said it expected the collapse in the gold price would lead to more unwanted jewellery being resold to consumers rather than sold as scrap to metal dealers. \"We sell as much as we can through shop windows, and anything that we can't gets sold as scrap \u2013 but that is subject to the gold price,\" a spokesman said. \"As the price falls we expect more will be resold as jewellery rather than melted down.\" Rival pawnbroker Albemarle &amp; Bond has already warned investors that it has been forced to \"revise down\" its profit expectations because of the gold price collapse.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "G4S, the controversial private security company, is to run services providing medical examinations and counselling for victims of rape and sexual assault in the West Midlands. The company has been awarded a three-year contract to take over two sexual assault referral centres (Sarcs) in Birmingham and Walsall. The national network of 33 centres across England which have developed over the past decade also allow rape and sexual assault victims to report attacks without going to the police first. The decision to award the contract for such sensitive services to the company, despite widespread criticism over its failings in the Olympics security contract, was made by local NHS commissioners who have recently taken over responsibility for the network of Sarcs from the police. Union leaders and violence against women campaigners sharply criticised the \"sell-off\" of such sensitive services to a private company with such a chequered record. Karen Jennings, Unison's assistant general secretary, said: \"It is shocking that a private, profit-making company with such a chequered record should be put in charge of these highly sensitive and intimate support services. A woman at her most vulnerable must be treated with the ultimate respect, dignity and sensitivity by trained professionals who she feels confident about placing her trust in,\" she said. \"The police service has developed over the years experience and expertise in working with women at such difficult times. They have well-established links with supportive services and agencies and that progress should not be undermined by selling these services off.\" Rape Crisis (England and Wales) said victims of sexual violence need to access long-term support and counselling as well as immediate medical and legal help: \"Our concern is that commissioning generic private contractors such as G4S to run Sarcs will lead to a focus on cost-efficiency above the needs of sexual violence victims and, in particular, that crucial long-term support services will be sacrificed in the name of cost-cutting.\" The decision to give G4S the contract appears to follow complaints that the existing centre in the West Midlands had failed to meet official minimum standards for at least four years. G4S Forensic and Medical Services is already involved in providing similar services in Essex, Worcester and Telford. Women \"crisis workers\" staff the centres, assist with medical assessment and provide advice on follow-up services. G4S also provides women-only call handlers for dedicated phone lines for victims who contact Sarcs in Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Wiltshire and Hertfordshire. It also provides a specialist service for child victims of sexual abuse in Devon. The company has recently advertised for \"female crisis workers\" to work at Sarcs at \u00a312.50 an hour and to be on call on a 24/7 rota. In response to the criticism, Gary Green, managing director of G4S Forensic and Medical Services, said it has been working in this area since 2005 and had developed substantial expertise in providing a high standard of care while helping the police protect the evidence they need to secure a conviction: \"Our dedicated medical staff come from a range of backgrounds in health and social care and are absolutely committed to looking after the needs of the victim at what can be a very traumatic time. That's why we work with the local health services and the police to ensure that in the centres we manage, we have specially trained advocates focused solely on the welfare of those who come forward to report rape or sexual assault.\" At the launch of the West Midlands G4S contracts earlier this week, Chief Superintendent Simon Hyde, the West Midlands police's head of public protection, said: \"Research and evidence stresses how important it is for victims to be able to access skilled, experienced forensic medical practitioners as part of the service, and that a high ratio of these physicians should be female. \"We wanted to bring the focus back on the service we provide to victims and have ensured that we have consulted with our partners and voluntary agencies to ensure the facilities provided through the NHS give the highest standards of victim care and treatment.\"",

      "bodyText": "HSBC suffered an embarrassing 11% shareholder rebellion against its executive pay report on Friday. Douglas Flint, chairman of the bank, said just 89% of investors voting ahead of its annual meeting supported its pay scheme, which handed chief executive Stuart Gulliver a near \u00a32m annual bonus despite the bank's involvement in a string of high profile scandals, including helping Mexican drug barons launder money. The bank said Gulliver's bonus was awarded in recognition of his \"strong leadership\" and \"personal behaviour\" in tackling the revelations that led to the bank being fined \u00a31.2bn by US authorities for allowing at least $880m (\u00a3582m) of drug trafficking money to be laundered throughout the bank's accounts. Gulliver's total pay and benefits for 2012 came in at \u00a37.4m - more than 500 times that earned by the bank's lowest paid workers. A total of 204 HSBC staff collected more than \u00a31m in pay and benefits last year. Britain's biggest union, Unite, described the scale of the pay as an \"outrage\" given that some of its members at HSBC take home \u00a314,000 a year and are facing changes to their pension schemes and holidays. The bank did not immediately state how many of its investors abstained from the pay vote, which could increase the proportion of shareholders failing to back the remuneration report.

Judge John Gleeson is now believed to be considering rejecting the deal, a move that could leave HSBC facing a criminal prosecution and the threat that its charter to do business in the US could be revoked. US authorities reached the deal with HSBC last December after uncovering evidence that the bank had illegally conducted transactions on behalf of Mexican drug lords, terrorists and customers in Cuba, Iran, Libya, Sudan and Burma \u2013 all countries that were subject to US sanctions.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fears that Britain faces years more of weak growth were raised by a leading Bank of England policymaker when he warned that adjustment to the tougher post-crisis climate was only two-thirds to three-quarters complete. Speaking in Cardiff on Friday, Paul Fisher said there had been nothing to compare with the recent sluggish performance of the economy since modern quarterly growth data was first produced in 1955. \"It is as if the different groups within our society \u2013 households, businesses, banks and the government \u2013 have all decided that their future financial positions, on average, will be worse than they thought before the crisis\", said Threadneedle Street's director for markets. Fisher added that the willingness of people to accept cuts in their living standards was explained by their downbeat view of the future. \"One possible household reaction to lower expected incomes is for people to try and work harder, and certainly to avoid unemployment if at all possible. This means being willing to stay in (or find) work even though the benefits from that \u2013 real wages \u2013 are being squeezed. \"The acquiescence of the UK labour force in accepting lower real wages is quite remarkable for those of us who grew up during the wage-price spirals of the 1970s and 80s.

      "body": "<p>Fears that Britain faces years more of weak growth were raised by a leading Bank of England policymaker when he warned that adjustment to the tougher post-crisis climate was only two-thirds to three-quarters complete.</p> <p>Speaking in Cardiff on Friday, Paul Fisher said there had been nothing to compare with the recent sluggish performance of the economy since modern quarterly growth data was first produced in 1955.</p> <p>\"It is as if the different groups within our society \u2013 households, businesses, banks and the government \u2013 have all decided that their future financial positions, on average, will be worse than they thought before the crisis\", said Threadneedle Street's director for markets.</p> <p>Fisher added that the willingness of people to accept cuts in their living standards was explained by their downbeat view of the future.</p> <p>\"One possible household reaction to lower expected incomes is for people to try and work harder, and certainly to avoid unemployment if at all possible. This means being willing to stay in (or find) work even though the benefits from that \u2013 real wages \u2013 are being squeezed.</p> <p>\"The acquiescence of the UK labour force in accepting lower real wages is quite remarkable for those of us who grew up during the wage-price spirals of the 1970s and 80s. It explains in part why unemployment has stayed much lower than we would have expected, given the weakness of output growth. Much of the labour force has priced itself into work.\"</p> <p>As one of the three members of the Bank's monetary policy committee pressing for additional stimulus, Fisher said growth was likely to remain below trend until there had been further adjustments to the post-crisis environment. \"That includes households, the public sector, banks and other businesses.
