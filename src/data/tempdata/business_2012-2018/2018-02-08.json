      "bodyText": "Tory MPs only seem to be interested in fighting and plotting over Brexit, but, if they could avert their gaze from Jacob Rees-Mogg temporarily, they\u2019d find that the future of GKN is a subject worth debating. Melrose\u2019s \u00a37bn hostile bid has received disgracefully little political scrutiny. Sir Vince Cable, for the Lib Dems, and a few Labour MPs are doing their best to generate interest, but they need help. Theresa May said in the Commons on Wednesday that the government \u201cwill be looking closely\u201d at the proposed takeover, but she sounded as if she was ticking a box. GKN is not a BAE Systems or a Rolls-Royce, of course. The government doesn\u2019t hold a golden share and objections to the deal on the grounds of UK national security don\u2019t really work. Indeed, the US department of defense probably has more reason to make a fuss over security, since much of GKN\u2019s most sensitive work is US-related. The company supplies cockpit canopies with stealth technology for Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 fighters and is a tier-one supplier to a big US development project, Northrop Grumman\u2019s B-21 Raider heavy bomber. But the non-security issues raised by Melrose\u2019s bid are also important. Aside from the two UK big firms behind our nuclear submarines, does the government care about industrial ownership? Only 6,000 of GKN\u2019s 56,000 employees work in the UK, but the automotive division is heavily invested in drive systems for electric cars. Would the government be happy if Melrose \u2013 or even GKN itself \u2013 sold that business to a Chinese buyer? Wasn\u2019t being big in electric cars also part of the business secretary Greg Clark\u2019s industrial vision for the UK? Some will argue that we should relax about Melrose\u2019s offer. The bidder is a UK-listed company and Cable shouldn\u2019t overstate the asset-stripping charge. Yes, Melrose is a long-term seller, but there is usually an investment phase beforehand. It is not ridiculous to suppose that GKN\u2019s competitive edge might be sharpened under new ownership. The point, though, is that Melrose\u2019s multimillionaire bosses have so far merely waved their record for enriching shareholders (and themselves) and volunteered only breezy plans for what they\u2019d actually do with GKN. Politicians could usefully ask detailed questions. For example: GKN is involved in a research programme called \u201cWings of the Future\u201d, with the aim of benefiting the commercial aerospace industry in the UK. Would Melrose commit to that project? If it didn\u2019t, it is easier to imagine Airbus, another partner in that programme, slipping more of its UK wing production to the continent. That\u2019s what makes GKN very different from companies Melrose has owned in the past \u2013 it is bigger and more connected to other parts in the UK industrial chain. And, since Melrose is only ever a medium-term owner, the stakes are high. There are questions for GKN, too. There\u2019s not much point hammering Melrose for hard R&amp;D commitments if GKN\u2019s panicked board would happily flog the aerospace business to the first private equity firm that showed up. But MPs ought to show an interest \u2013 GKN is an important UK company. And a business secretary who can publish a 255-page paper on industrial strategy ought to prove he is awake when it matters most. TalkTalk\u2019s bad precedent A profits warning, a severe dividend cut and a \u00a3200m equity placing at a 10-year low for the share price: you\u2019d struggle to put a positive gloss on that batch of news, but TalkTalk did its best. Indeed, Sir Charles Dunstone\u2019s outfit made a decent fist of the job by inviting the outside world to admire the pluck and ambition in the plan to build ultrafast broadband connections to 3m UK premises. That does deserve applause, even if it\u2019s actually InfraCapital, the infrastructure unit of the fund manager M&amp;G, that is putting up most of the funding. M&amp;G is supplying \u00a3400m versus TalkTalk\u2019s \u00a3100m. We wait to see if all the cash is actually spent, but betting on next-generation broadband sounds more sensible than TalkTalk\u2019s past haphazard efforts with mobile. If a little more pressure is put on BT Openreach to hurry up with full fibre, that\u2019s good, too. Yet the structure of TalkTalk\u2019s fundraising was inexcusable. It was a placing of shares representing 19.9% of the share price, whereas 9.9% is the accepted norm to protect the interests of all shareholders. \u201cTalkTalk\u2019s actions are a blatant disregard of the industry-accepted standards,\u201d said the Investment Association, representing fund managers.

Last year the UK subsidiary of the bankrupt US chain won a stay of execution after landlords took back the keys to 26 shops and accepted less rent for those that stayed open. But that rescue plan has been torn up after advisers working on the financial restructuring of the US parent group hoisted the \u201cfor sale\u201d sign over the loss-making UK business as well its other European stores. Industry sources said the company, which has 3,200 staff in the UK, wanted to conclude a deal before the end of the month \u2013 when several payments are due. It is understood 2018 trading has started poorly, with weak UK sales compounded by the disappointing picture emerging from the US, where toy giants Hasbro and Mattel both reported disappointing figures after tough Christmas trading. On Thursday Sky News reported that Hilco, the restructuring firm which bought HMV out of administration in 2013, was among a small group of bidders circling Toys R Us. Analysts said restructuring experts such as Hilco tended to wait for businesses to enter administration before making their move. In September Toys R Us\u2019s American parent filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada after running up $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of debts and struggling to compete online. It is trying to restructure its loans and finances. In January the retailer said it would close 180 of its US stores. The UK chain has been struggling for the same reasons as its parent, with shoppers shunning the large out-of-town sheds that are synonymous with the Toys R Us brand in favour of buying online or from supermarkets. The retailer has been loss-making for seven out of the past eight years, with the most recent accounts filed at Companies House showing an operating loss of \u00a3500,000 on sales of \u00a3418m in the year to January. Last year\u2019s CVA process was complicated by tense negotiations with the Pension Protection Fund, the state-backed pensions lifeboat, which wanted to secure cash up front to fill the hole in the retailer\u2019s pension fund. The scheme has 600 members and a deficit of about \u00a330m under the PPF assessment, or as much as \u00a393m on the basis of a buyout by an insurer. The company agreed to pump more than \u00a39m into the pension fund over the next two years. It made a \u00a31.1m payment in January but another of the same size is due in April.",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of courier giant DPD has admitted breaking the law by taking photographs on his mobile phone while driving on a motorway. Dwain McDonald, who oversees a network of 5,000 professional drivers who deliver for John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer and Amazon, boasted about how he used his phone to take a picture of a DPD van while driving on the M62 between Manchester and Leeds. McDonald admitted to the crime while giving a slide presentation, which was captured on video and posted to YouTube in 2016. Thirty-two people were killed in the UK in 2016 as a result of drivers using mobile phones and it caused 105 further serious accidents, according to the latest official crash statistics. \u201cI am taking a photograph while I am driving and you shouldn\u2019t really do this,\u201d he said, before describing how he saw a courier van ahead of him that didn\u2019t have the correct logo on its door. \u201cI pulled level with him and I can see the driver. He\u2019s thinking, \u2018Who\u2019s this weirdo in a black car?\u2019 I pull back, so I get my phone out. Illegal, I\u2019m sorry, I know, but boof, takes that picture.\u201d He said he wanted to show his managers who he was on his way to meet that he was unhappy at the lack of attention to detail the van driver was showing. \u201cOn the left-hand door, it should say DPD \u2013 in big letters, DPD,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018Come on, it\u2019s not acceptable.\u2019 That door must have been damaged and replaced but because they wanted to use the van again, they didn\u2019t finish the job. That\u2019s the attention to detail. It\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d DPD\u2019s contracts with its self-employed drivers includes a clause insisting that they comply with all laws and regulations and the company reserves the right to terminate their contract if they breach any conditions. Depots also display posters reminding drivers not to use their mobile phones while driving. When the digital handheld unit that drivers use is switched on for the first time, it warns them not to be distracted by it while driving, couriers said. The DPD health and safety policy, signed off by McDonald himself, states: \u201cManagers and supervisors are expected to lead by example.\u201d It says: \u201cEmployees must not knowingly act in a way that damages the reputation of the company or causes either them or the company to be in breach of the law.\u201d A spokesperson for Brake, the road safety charity, said: \u201cDriving is the most dangerous thing most of us do on a daily basis; it is a complex task, which requires your full attention to do so safely. Using a mobile phone to take photographs at the wheel, regardless of their purpose, is dangerous behaviour that increases risk of a crash resulting in death or serious injury.\u201d DPD declined to comment on the remarks. McDonald\u2019s admission emerged at the end of a week in which the firm was widely condemned for its treatment of Don Lane, a driver for the company for 19 years who died from diabetes after he was fined for missing a delivery because he needed to attend a doctor\u2019s appointment to treat the illness. DPD later said it was \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d that Lane had been charged. Lane\u2019s case threw up road safety concerns because he collapsed twice at the wheel of his van, once while delivering parcels in Dorset. His doctor also raised concerns about how Lane was being monitored to ensure that he was fit to drive according to DVLA guidance. The government\u2019s road safety literature makes clear it is \u201cillegal to use a handheld mobile when driving. This includes using your phone to follow a map, read a text or check social media. This applies even if you\u2019re stopped at traffic lights or queueing in traffic.\u201d Research published in the British Medical Journal suggests that drivers using their phones are four times more likely to be in a crash. According to the RAC, 23% of drivers admitted to using a handheld mobile at the wheel to make or take a call in the past 12 months, and 12% admitted to checking texts, email or social media.",

      "body": "<p>The chief executive of courier giant DPD has admitted breaking the law by taking photographs on his mobile phone while driving on a motorway. Dwain McDonald, who oversees a network of 5,000 professional drivers who deliver for John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer and Amazon, boasted about how he used his phone to take a picture of a DPD van while driving on the M62 between Manchester and Leeds.</p> \n<p>McDonald admitted to the crime while giving a slide presentation, which was captured on video and posted to YouTube in 2016. Thirty-two people were killed in the UK in 2016 as a result of drivers using mobile phones and it caused 105 further serious accidents, according to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/665183/ras50001.ods\">latest official crash statistics</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am taking a photograph while I am driving and you shouldn\u2019t really do this,\u201d he said, before describing how he saw a courier van ahead of him that didn\u2019t have the correct logo on its door. \u201cI pulled level with him and I can see the driver. He\u2019s thinking, \u2018Who\u2019s this weirdo in a black car?\u2019 I pull back, so I get my phone out. Illegal, I\u2019m sorry, I know, but boof, takes that picture.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said he wanted to show his managers who he was on his way to meet that he was unhappy at the lack of attention to detail the van driver was showing.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn the left-hand door, it should say DPD \u2013 in big letters, DPD,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018Come on, it\u2019s not acceptable.\u2019 That door must have been damaged and replaced but because they wanted to use the van again, they didn\u2019t finish the job. That\u2019s the attention to detail. It\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d</p> \n<p>DPD\u2019s contracts with its self-employed drivers includes a clause insisting that they comply with all laws and regulations and the company reserves the right to terminate their contract if they breach any conditions. Depots also display posters reminding drivers not to use their mobile phones while driving. When the digital handheld unit that drivers use is switched on for the first time, it warns them not to be distracted by it while driving, couriers said.</p> \n<p>The DPD health and safety policy, signed off by McDonald himself, states: \u201cManagers and supervisors are expected to lead by example.\u201d It says: \u201cEmployees must not knowingly act in a way that damages the reputation of the company or causes either them or the company to be in breach of the law.\u201d</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for Brake, the road safety charity, said: \u201cDriving is the most dangerous thing most of us do on a daily basis; it is a complex task, which requires your full attention to do so safely. Using a mobile phone to take photographs at the wheel, regardless of their purpose, is dangerous behaviour that increases risk of a crash resulting in death or serious injury.\u201d</p> \n<p>DPD declined to comment on the remarks. McDonald\u2019s admission emerged at the end of a week in which the firm was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/05/pressure-grows-on-dpd-and-theresa-may-after-courier-dies-of-diabetes\">widely condemned for its treatment of Don Lane</a>, a driver for the company for 19 years who died from diabetes after he was fined for missing a delivery because he needed to attend a doctor\u2019s appointment to treat the illness. DPD later said it was \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d that Lane had been charged. </p> \n<p>Lane\u2019s case threw up road safety concerns because he collapsed twice at the wheel of his van, once while delivering parcels in Dorset. His doctor also raised concerns about how Lane was being monitored to ensure that he was fit to drive according to DVLA guidance.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s road safety literature makes clear it is \u201cillegal to use a handheld mobile when driving. This includes using your phone to follow a map, read a text or check social media. This applies even if you\u2019re stopped at traffic lights or queueing in traffic.\u201d</p> \n<p>Research published in the British Medical Journal suggests that drivers using their phones are four times more likely to be in a crash.</p> \n<p>According to the RAC, 23% of drivers admitted to using a handheld mobile at the wheel to make or take a call in the past 12 months, and 12% admitted to checking texts, email or social media.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In December last year, an MP from the ruling Fidesz party of hardline Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n posted a photograph on Facebook showing a group of people standing next to a slaughtered pig. On the pig\u2019s charred skin were carved the words \u201cO volt a Soros\u201d. The MP denied they referred to the billionaire financier and philanthropist, George Soros. The phrase can be translated either as \u201cIt was his turn,\u201d or as \u201cThis was Soros.\u201d The transformation of Soros, 87, from generous promoter of democracy, human rights and open borders in the former eastern bloc and elsewhere to global hate figure for nationalists and populists from Hungary to the US has been swift. Not only fringe figures but elected officials have routinely accused him of forcing his views on societies and even destroying them. He makes an easy and a useful enemy: a liberal, an internationalist, the 29th richest man in the world \u2013 and Jewish. \u201cIt is a witch-hunt being pursued by authoritarian, rightwing populists,\u201d Jacek Kucharczyk of Poland\u2019s Institute of Public Affairs \u2013 which receives some Soros funding \u2013 said last year. \u201cAnd there\u2019s an undertone of antisemitism in it. He\u2019s the perfect figure for explaining to hardcore voters why the world is the way it is.\u201d The Hungarian-American hedge fund owner first hit the headlines in Britain in 1992 after he earned a reported $1bn \u2013 and the title \u201cthe man who broke the Bank of England\u201d \u2013 by betting on Black Wednesday. He was back on the front pages on Thursday after it emerged that his foundation had contributed \u00a3400,000 to the Best for Britain group, which aims to stop Brexit. The Daily Telegraph called the public, well-advertised campaign a \u201csecret plot\u201d and described Soros as \u201ca rich gambler \u2026 accused of meddling in nation\u2019s affairs\u201d, prompting angry accusations that it was dredging up antisemitic slurs and shadowy Jewish conspiracies. For much of the 1990s and early 2000s, Soros \u2013 who was born in Budapest in 1930, survived Nazi-occupied Hungary, emigrated to the UK in 1947, then settled in the US and made his fortune on Wall Street \u2013 was a low-key, even appreciated figure. His Open Society Foundations (OSF), the first of which opened in 1984, in Hungary, have funded NGOs advancing human rights, the rule of law, education, public health, LGBT and Roma rights, a free press, and even public transport networks across central and eastern Europe and in more than 120 countries. The OSF\u2019s endowment currently stands at about $18bn, making it the third largest charitable foundation in the world. Since 1979, and Soros\u2019s first act of philanthropy \u2013 scholarships for black South African children under apartheid \u2013 it has given away $14bn. Poland\u2019s former president, Bronislaw Komorowski, awarded the financier one of the country\u2019s highest honours in 2012 for his contribution to post-communist civil society. Orb\u00e1n himself spent a year at Oxford university in 1989 on a scholarship funded by Soros. But the tide turned against the financier during Europe\u2019s 2015 refugee crisis, when his generous backing for the charities helping migrants, and support for the EU\u2019s resettlement plan, brought him into direct conflict with ultra-conservative, right-wing governments including Orb\u00e1n\u2019s. The Hungarian prime minister, on course for re-election next month, now calls Soros \u201can American financial speculator attacking Hungary\u201d who has \u201cdestroyed the lives of millions of Europeans\u201d, and has based his election campaign on attacking a supposed \u201cSoros plan\u201d to flood Hungary with Muslim migrants. Posters have been put up featuring a photograph of the philanthropist, who has donated $400m to Hungarian NGOs, bearing the words: \u201cDon\u2019t let Soros have the last laugh.\u201d It is not only in the country of his birth that Soros is demonised. The OSF was ejected from Russia in 2015, as \u201ca threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state\u201d. Last year, a leading MP from Poland\u2019s ruling right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party called Soros \u201cthe most dangerous man in the world\u201d, claiming he was financing \u201canti-Christian and anti-national activities\u201d. The chair of Romania\u2019s ruling Social Democrats say he has \u201cbrought evil to Romania\u201d. Macedonian rightwingers have launched a group called SOS: Stop Operation Soros. In the US, Soros\u2019s support for groups protecting gay and lesbian rights and campaigning to reduce police violence has made him a target for rightwing attacks, further fuelled by donations to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and a $10m donation to combating hate crime following the 2016 election of Donald Trump. Rightwing media claimed Soros \u201cbrought in protesters from all over the country\u201d for the anti-Trump Women\u2019s March last January. The conservative Breitbart News website has published numerous articles claiming to \u201cexpose Soros\u2019s global network \u2026 financing liberal, open-border causes\u201d. Some attacks go further. The philanthropist\u2019s Jewish roots and successful career as an international financier mean he fits easily in the role of what the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, the Jewish rights group, called the \u201cglobal, manipulative Jewish monster who can be blamed for all evils and problems\u201d. Reviving old antisemitic conspiracy theories, Russian media, for example, have routinely focused on Soros\u2019s Jewish background; the state-funded broadcaster RT tweeted in 2016 that he \u201cdid not get his pound of flesh this time\u201d. In the US, alt-right campaigners opposed to HR McMaster also used a cartoon showing Trump\u2019s national security adviser being manipulated by puppet masters labelled \u201cSoros\u201d and \u201cRothschilds\u201d (the \u201cRothschilds\u201d label was later changed to \u201cSaudis\u201d after complaints of antisemitism.) In Britain, the pro-Brexit campaign Leave.EU has tweeted drawings portraying the Labour MP David Lammy as a puppet with his strings controlled by Soros, and labelled the financier\u2019s philanthropic operations \u201cthe Soros Web\u201d.",

His Open Society Foundations (OSF), the first of which opened in 1984, in Hungary, have funded NGOs advancing human rights, the rule of law, education, public health, LGBT and Roma rights, a free press, and even public transport networks across central and eastern Europe and in more than 120 countries.</p> <p>The OSF\u2019s endowment currently stands at about $18bn, making it the third largest charitable foundation in the world. Since 1979, and Soros\u2019s first act of philanthropy \u2013 scholarships for black South African children under apartheid \u2013 it has given away $14bn. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland\">Poland</a>\u2019s former president, Bronislaw Komorowski, awarded the financier one of the country\u2019s highest honours in 2012 for his contribution to post-communist civil society. Orb\u00e1n himself spent a year at Oxford university in 1989 on a scholarship funded by Soros.</p> <p>But the tide turned against the financier during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/migration-crisis-the-new-routes-to-europe\">Europe\u2019s 2015 refugee crisis</a>, when his generous backing for the charities helping migrants, and support for the EU\u2019s resettlement plan, brought him into direct conflict with ultra-conservative, right-wing governments including Orb\u00e1n\u2019s.</p> <p>The Hungarian prime minister, on course for re-election next month, now calls Soros \u201can American financial speculator attacking Hungary\u201d who has \u201cdestroyed the lives of millions of Europeans\u201d, and has based his election campaign on attacking a supposed \u201cSoros plan\u201d to flood Hungary with Muslim migrants. </p> <p>Posters have been put up featuring a photograph of the philanthropist, who has donated $400m to Hungarian NGOs, bearing the words: \u201cDon\u2019t let Soros have the last laugh.\u201d </p> <p>It is not only in the country of his birth that Soros is demonised. The OSF was ejected from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> in 2015, as \u201ca threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state\u201d. </p> <p>Last year, a leading MP from Poland\u2019s ruling right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party called Soros \u201cthe most dangerous man in the world\u201d, claiming he was financing \u201canti-Christian and anti-national activities\u201d. The chair of Romania\u2019s ruling Social Democrats say he has \u201cbrought evil to Romania\u201d.

    "webTitle": "MPs urge ministers to block GKN takeover over security concerns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "MPs have asked the government whether it will consider using powers to block takeovers for national security reasons to stop a hostile bid for the engineering company GKN, which makes technology used in the F-35 fighter jet. GKN has rejected as \u201cderisory\u201d a \u00a37bn offer from the turnaround specialist Melrose after it appealed directly to shareholders rather than seeking consent from the company\u2019s management. Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, has written to the business secretary, Greg Clark, to ask whether the government has considered using its powers to block the deal. The appeal follows an assurance from Theresa May earlier this week that the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) would be \u201clooking closely\u201d at the proposed takeover. In her letter to Clark, Reeves asked for \u201cmore detail about the nature of the discussions you have had with the chief executives of both GKN and Melrose\u201d. \u201cIn particular, have you established whether there are sufficient grounds for you to intervene in the public interest on the grounds of national security?\u201d she wrote. She also asked whether Clark, who is weighing up adding to Whitehall\u2019s powers to block takeovers, to consider \u201cwidening the scope\u201d for government intervention. \u201cFor example, in other countries, such as Germany, I understand that the law requires a qualified majority of 75% of votes cast for certain actions associated with a hostile takeover,\u201d Reeves wrote. She also asked whether the government would reopen proposals to limit the ability of shareholders to vote on takeovers if they have only recently bought shares. Reeves referred to the controversial \u00a312bn takeover of Cadbury by Kraft in 2010, when hedge funds and other speculators were accused of buying up shares in the chocolate-maker so that they could vote in favour of a deal and make a quick profit. A BEIS spokesperson said: \u201cWhile this is a commercial matter for the companies involved, government is closely monitoring the situation. Business secretary Greg Clark has spoken on an impartial basis to both companies.\u201d The spokesperson added that the takeover code, which governs corporate mergers and acquisitions, had been strengthened to \u201cgive companies subject to a bid more time to prepare their response\u201d. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, has urged Clark to stop the takeover, which she said would \u201crisk weakening our industrial base and diminishing our national defence capabilities\u201d. The former business secretary Vince Cable warned earlier this week that Melrose was an \u201casset-stripper\u201d whose bid for GKN posed a \u201cserious threat\u201d to the UK industrial strategy. The Liberal Democrat leader\u2019s comment is understood to refer to Melrose\u2019s strategy of taking over underperforming companies and stripping out inefficient layers of management or selling less profitable assets. A deal for GKN would be its largest and most controversial to date, given the firm\u2019s work in areas that involve the UK military. GKN works in automotive, metallurgy and aerospace, including sensitive areas such as technology for the US defence company Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35B fighter jet, 138 of which have been ordered for the Royal Air Force. The company, which used to be known as Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds and traces its history back to 1759, has struggled in recent years and issued a profit warning after a downturn in its US aerospace business. GKN has proposed splitting into two rather than accepting the offer from Melrose, whose chief executive, Simon Peckham, has said the decision is \u201cdown to the shareholders now\u201d. Melrose, founded in 2003, said it would not pursue a \u201chasty\u201d split of the automotive and aerospace divisions, but would sell small parts of GKN to \u201csimplify and declutter\u201d the business. In a proposal document sent to shareholders, Melrose insisted it would take its national security obligations seriously if the cash-plus-shares offer succeeded. \u201cAs an established UK public company with relevant experience, we fully recognise our requirements in this regard and have no doubt that this is completely compatible with our approach,\u201d the company said.",

      "bodyText": "An interest rate rise is coming and it is coming fast. That was the clear message from the Bank of England in a marked shift in its policy stance from supporting growth to tackling inflation. Back in November when Threadneedle Street raised borrowing costs for the first time in a decade it sugared the pill with some doveish language that suggested there would only be two further increases over the next three years. This time the Bank has done the precise opposite. All nine members of the monetary policy committee voted for rates to remain on hold at 0.5% but the rhetoric was markedly more muscular. The key judgement is that monetary policy now needs to be tightened more quickly and to a greater extent than anticipated at the time of the November inflation report. Previously, the City had been split 50:50 on the chances of an increase in interest rates to 0.75% in May. The latest commentary from the Bank will shift the dial decisively towards a move in three months time. The Bank doesn\u2019t think the economy is booming despite raising its forecasts on the back of an improving global economy. It thinks GDP will increase by about 1.75% a year between 2018 and 2020 \u2013 modest by historic standards. The problem as the MPC sees it is that the economy only has the potential to grow by 1.5% a year as the spare capacity that resulted from the deep recession of a decade ago has been used up. Actual growth of 1.75% against potential growth of 1.5% means inflation above the government\u2019s target of 2% and that in turn requires higher interest rates. The Bank has been consistently wrong about the amount of slack in the economy in the past. In particular, it has under-estimated how far unemployment can fall without leading to wage pressures building, and has now cut that forecast again to 4.25% in the latest report. But unless something seriously bad happens to the economy, businesses and consumers are being softened up for a spring rate rise.",

The latest commentary from the Bank will shift the dial decisively towards a move in three months time.</p> \n<p>The Bank doesn\u2019t think the economy is booming despite raising its forecasts on the back of an improving global economy. It thinks GDP will increase by about 1.75% a year between 2018 and 2020 \u2013 modest by historic standards.</p> \n<p>The problem as the MPC sees it is that the economy only has the potential to grow by 1.5% a year as the spare capacity that resulted from the deep recession of a decade ago has been used up. Actual growth of 1.75% against potential growth of 1.5% means inflation above the government\u2019s target of 2% and that in turn requires higher interest rates.</p> \n<p>The Bank has been consistently wrong about the amount of slack in the economy in the past. In particular, it has under-estimated how far unemployment can fall without leading to wage pressures building, and has now cut that forecast again to 4.25% in the latest report.</p> \n<p>But unless something seriously bad happens to the economy, businesses and consumers are being softened up for a spring rate rise.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has signalled that an interest rate hike is coming from as early as May and that there are more to come, as the economy accelerates with help from booming global growth. Threadneedle Street said it would need to raise rates to tackle stubbornly high inflation \u201csomewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent\u201d than it had anticipated towards the end of last year. While the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) voted unanimously to leave rates at 0.50% this month, the tone of its discussion suggests the cost of borrowing will not remain this low for much longer. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, had previously suggested there could be two further rate hikes to curb inflation over the next three years \u2013 but speculation will now mount over the chance of additional rate hikes. The pound rose on foreign exchanges following the interest rate decision, hitting almost $1.40 against the dollar. City investors give a 75% chance of a rate hike in May, after having previously given a 50-50 probability. The FTSE 100 sold off sharply, falling by more than 108.7 points to below 7,200, amid a global stock market rout triggered by concerns among investors that central banks will need to raise interest rates faster than expected to curb rising inflation. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 400 points by lunchtime. Threadneedle Street said inflation would fall more gradually than it had previously anticipated, because workers\u2019 pay is slowly beginning to pick-up and as the oil prices is rising. \u201cThe outlook for growth and inflation [is] likely to require some ongoing withdrawal of monetary stimulus,\u201d the MPC said. Although the consumer price index reached 3.1% in November and is forecast to fall over the coming year as the effects of the weak pound following the Brexit vote begin to fade, the Bank said it is likely to remain above the 2% target. Writing to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to explain why inflation was more than one percentage point outside the government\u2019s target, Carney said it was now \u201cappropriate to set monetary policy so that inflation returns sustainably to its target\u201d after previously having left the rate unchanged to support jobs and growth. A sustained upswing in global economic activity over the past year \u2013 led by the eurozone and stronger growth in the US and China \u2013 has helped to prevent a sharper Brexit-related slowdown in Britain. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC and a former member of the MPC, warned that rates could rise up to three times this year as a result of inflationary pressures and global growth. \u201cAll this points to rising interest rates, both here in the UK and in other major economies.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is still likely that we will see at least one quarter point rise in 2018 and possibly two or three.\u201d Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown also said the drive to constrain inflation meant \u201crates could rise faster and further than investors had expected.\u201d Britain grew at its fastest rate in 2017 in the final quarter of the year, after a slump prompted by a slowdown in consumer spending earlier in the year, but is now forecast to rebound with the help of global trade. That is despite tough conditions for British households under intense pressure since the Brexit vote as the weak pound pushes up the cost of importing food and fuel. Brexit uncertainty has constrained the speed at which the UK can grow before prices begin to spiral, according to the Bank, which said the growth potential of the economy had been clipped below the levels it was able to achieve in previous years. Threadneedle Street reckons the annual supply capacity of the economy can only rise by about 1.5% before generating increased inflationary pressures, but estimates GDP growth will average about 1.75% each year until 2021. Worries over rising inflation have spooked financial markets in recent weeks, pushing up bond yields and triggering a sell-off in shares, as investors speculate how fast central banks will tighten monetary policy. Although most of the focus has been on the Federal Reserve and the arrival of its new chairman, Jerome Powell, the Bank\u2019s latest inflation report is likely to have fuelled fears in the City. The MPC said it was too early to gauge how large and persistent market corrections were likely to be. \u201cNotwithstanding recent volatility in financial markets, global financial conditions remain supportive,\u201d it added.",

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u2013 which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u2013 coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates.

Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored.

The official receiver, the part of the Insolvency Service poring over Carillion\u2019s public and private sector contracts, said it had \u201csafeguarded\u201d 1,221 jobs, taking the total number saved to 2,240. \u201cThese roles are connected to the delivery of both public and private contracts and cover services for a city council, as well as a range of facilities management services,\u201d a spokesperson for the official receiver said. But the spokesperson also announced a further 101 redundancies, adding to the 829 job losses that have already been announced. The roles that will be cut were described as \u201ca mix of back-office functions and engineering support roles that new suppliers no longer require\u201d. More than 16,000 of Carillion\u2019s UK workforce, which numbered 19,500 at the time of the company\u2019s financial failure, still face an uncertain future. \u201cWe continue to engage with staff, elected employee representatives and unions throughout. Those who have lost their jobs will be able to find support through Jobcentre Plus\u2019s rapid response service and are also entitled to make a claim for statutory redundancy payments,\u201d said the official receiver\u2019s spokesperson. \u201cThe liquidation process continues and we remain focused on engaging with staff and new suppliers about any changes to jobs and contracts. \u201cContinued support by Carillion\u2019s public and private sector customers is enabling as many employees as possible to be retained in the interim until all contracts have been worked through.\u201d The latest jobs update comes days after former Carillion directors were accused by MPs of being \u201cdelusional\u201d after giving evidence before a joint inquiry by two select committees. The seven former directors were asked if they would volunteer to hand back bonuses they were paid in the final years before the company\u2019s failure, but none offered to do so. They also denied prioritising shareholders\u2019 dividends over injecting more money into the company\u2019s pension scheme to plug a deficit estimated at \u00a3990m.",

In a not-so-subtle message to employers, and as workers endure their longest period of declining living standards in more than 25 years, Philip Lowe has said wages should ideally begin growing on the back of stronger productivity growth, but even if productivity growth were to be around the average of recent years, \u201ca faster rate of wage increase should still be possible\u201d now. He also reminded employers and policymakers that rising wages would be necessary to return inflation to normal levels, and to lift the economy out of its ultra-low interest rate funk. With households now worse off than they were six years ago, and with large businesses enjoying record profits, workers would benefit from a lift in real wages, he said. \u201cA lift in wage growth is likely to be necessary for inflation to average around the midpoint of the 2-3% medium-term inflation target,\u201d he said. \u201cStronger growth in real wages would also boost household incomes and create a stronger sense of shared prosperity.\u201d Speaking at the A50 Australian Economic Forum in Sydney on Thursday evening, Lowe warned against assuming the RBA would begin lifting interest rates when other advanced economies, such as the United States, started lifting theirs significantly. He said circumstances in Australia were different because the economy was still a long way from what could be considered full employment, and the RBA\u2019s central scenario for inflation was for it to remain below the midpoint of the medium-term target range for \u201cthe next couple of years\u201d. \u201cWe expect to make further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to the midpoint of the target range [and] if we make that progress, at some point it will be appropriate for interest rates in Australia to also start moving up,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] the Reserve Bank board does not see a strong case for near-term adjustment in monetary policy,\u201d he said. The RBA will release its latest quarterly statement on monetary policy on Friday. It will be the first such statement since November. Lowe said the RBA\u2019s forecasts for gross domestic product growth and inflation were little changed from three months ago. \u201cThe RBA\u2019s central scenario remains for the Australian economy to grow at an average rate of a bit over 3% over the next couple of years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis outlook has not been affected by the volatility in the stock market over recent days. Indeed, it is worth keeping in mind that the catalyst for this volatility was a reassessment in financial markets of the implication of strong growth for inflation in the United States. \u201cFor some time, many investors had been working under the assumptions that unusually low inflation and unusually low volatility in asset prices would persist, even with above-trend growth at a time of low unemployment. \u201cA reassessment of these assumptions now appears to be taking place against the backdrop of strong economic conditions globally.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Struggling department store chain Debenhams is to cut 320 jobs across the UK \u2013 one in four of its store managers. The retailer said it would remove a layer of management by March, similar to moves taken by several supermarket groups in recent weeks. The company said it aims to redeploy staff where possible. The cuts are part of a \u00a310m cost-saving plan, announced in January when the retailer issued a profit warning after poor Christmas trading, when UK like-for-like sales \u2013 which exclude any impact from new shopfloor space \u2013 tumbled 2.6%. The retailer said the after-Christmas sale had been worse than expected and that profit margins had been hit as a result of cutting prices to stay competitive. Prior to the key festive trading period chief executive Sergio Boucher, hired from Amazon to improve online sales and turn around the struggling retailer, had insisted that \u201cChristmas plays to our key strengths.\u201d In the event, the poor Christmas trade meant that Debenhams full year profits were likely to be between \u00a355m and \u00a365m \u2013 sharply below City expectations of \u00a383m. The shares plunged 20%, wiping almost \u00a370m off the market value of the Debenhams business. The shares were down marginally on news of the latest job cuts, at 29.2p. Two years ago they were changing hands at 78p. The chain is now valued at about \u00a3360m. The store chain said at the time of the profits warning that the UK trading environment was in a \u201cvolatile and highly competitive.\u201d . Debenhams\u2019 job cuts come as Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons are also stripping out layers of managerial roles, leading to thousands of job losses in the retail industry. The major food retailers have been affected by the success of the discount chains Aldi and Lidl, as well as a switch to shopping online and in small, local stores. Department stores, fashion and furniture chains \u2013 including New Look and House of Fraser \u2013 have also been struggling as a rise in food prices has put the squeeze on discretionary spending just as retailers\u2019 wage bills, business rates and wholesale costs rise. Debenhams said: \u201cWe are reviewing our retail structure. The review looks to identify how we can reduce cost and complexity in store processes so that we can focus our resources on serving customers better.\u201d The new structure would be in place by the end of March, it said. Debenhams stressed that the store managers affected are back office workers who do not deal directly with customers. The retailer wants to focus more on shopfloor staff to improve service. Not long after Bucher took the helm at Debenhams in October 2016, he moved 2,000 staff to the shopfloor. Debenhams has shut two stores, in Eltham, south-east London, and at Farnborough in Hampshire, and is considering eight more closures as part of Bucher\u2019s recovery plan. The group employs 22,000 people across the UK and Ireland and has 176 stores. The chain\u2019s troubles, however, have not put off major shareholder Mike Ashley. His Sports Direct empire increased its investment in Debenhams this week by taking on nearly 1% more contracts for difference, a form of derivative, giving it control over a 22.08% stake.",

      "bodyText": "UK insurer Aviva is the second-biggest investor in the Polish coal industry, the most polluting in Europe, according to a report that looks at insurance firms\u2019 involvement in the sector. Aviva is among a number of major European insurers that are backing the expansion of Poland\u2019s coal industry, undermining international efforts to battle climate change, according to research from Unfriend Coal, a global network of organisations including Greenpeace Switzerland, 350.org and the UK Tar Sands Network. Aviva has invested \u00a3372.7m in Polish coal, more than any other insurance company apart from the Dutch firm Nationale Nederlanden, the report found. Poland\u2019s coal industry is the second biggest in Europe, after Germany. Pollution from Polish coal is estimated to cause 5,830 premature deaths across Europe every year, Unfriend Coal said. The UN recently called for a stop to new coal power plants and an accelerated phase-out of existing ones. But Polish companies are planning to build power plants able to generate more than 10 gigawatts and open new mines holding more than 3.2bn tonnes of lignite, the dirtiest form of coal. Aviva\u2019s investments are held through its Polish pension fund, OFE Aviva BZ WBK. The fund increased its holdings in Polish coal companies by more than \u00a345m between 2016 and 2017. It has a 2.3% stake in the country\u2019s largest power company PGE, which operates two of Europe\u2019s most polluting coal plants at Be\u0142chat\u00f3w and Tur\u00f3w and plans to build new coal plants generating more than 5.2GW. Peter Bosshard, Unfriend Coal coordinator, said: \u201cUnlike all other insurers which are taking action on coal, Aviva decided to focus on engagement rather than on divestment, and have only divested from very few companies if engagement was completely unproductive.\u201d Aviva said it invested more than \u00a3525m in low-carbon projects such as renewable windfarms and solar energy last year. It added that it engaged with companies that derive more than 30% of revenue from coal to improve their business practices and will divest \u201cwhere we do not see sufficient movement to transition away from coal\u201d. \u201cIn Poland, local pension companies, including Aviva, manage customers\u2019 assets under a strict regulatory regime and are not able to influence the investment strategy for these. The investment guidelines focus on domestic equity where the energy industry is the second largest after the banking sector,\u201d it said. European insurers have invested more than \u00a31.15bn in Polish coal companies and have signed at least 21 contracts insuring coal plants since 2013, according to Unfriend Coal. Europe\u2019s biggest insurer, Allianz, is leading a consortium underwriting the biggest coal power plant under construction in Europe at Opole near Katowice, a PGE project, which is due to start operating next year. The consortium includes Italy\u2019s Generali, Germany\u2019s Munich Re and the Polish insurer PZU. Allianz said: \u201cWe will continue to insure utilities and mining companies when they show an adequate sustainability performance or suitable risk mitigation strategies.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s housing market got off to a subdued start in 2018, with sellers of \u00a31m-plus homes in London finding it toughest to find buyers in January, according to a survey of estate agents. Across the UK as whole, the number of sales, new buyers, and properties coming onto the market all fell in January, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said. New buyer inquiries fell for a 10th successive month and the number of properties coming on to estate agents\u2019 books slipped back to the record-low levels seen around the middle of 2017, signalling there will be no imminent pick-up in activity. \u201cThe latest Rics results point to housing transactions remaining pretty subdued over the coming months despite some more positive comments from contributors to the survey,\u201d said Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Rics. \u201cLack of inventory on agents\u2019 books continues to provide a major challenge with the number of valuations being undertaken not suggestive of a pick-up in new supply anytime soon.\u201d House prices edged upwards at a national level according to the survey, but sellers of top-end homes in particular were struggling to achieve asking prices, the Rics said. Of the estate agents surveyed, 67% said the sales price achieved on homes priced at \u00a31m or more had come in below asking price. The figure dropped to 56% of agents for properties listed between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a31m. The biggest price falls continued to be in London, but they also dropped in the south-east, East Anglia and the north-east. On the flip side, the north-west of England, Northern Ireland and Wales posted the strongest price growth compared to the rest of the UK. \u201cDivergent regional trends remain very much to the fore with the market in many parts of the country still actually behaving in a solid if unspectacular way despite the downbeat headlines,\u201d Rubinsohn said. \u201cAffordability issues continue to play a key role in explaining this pattern with those areas where house price earnings are most stretched seeing the softest markets.\u201d For the UK overall, agents are expecting house prices to be roughly flat in the coming three months. The Rics report was published a day after Halifax reported house prices falling for a second consecutive month in January, as consumers struggling with shrinking disposable income put major spending decisions on hold. The average price of a home in Britain fell 0.6% last month to \u00a3223,285, according to the mortgage lender\u2019s own data. It followed a 0.8% drop in prices in December, and drove down annual house price growth to 2.2%, the slowest rate in six months. Halifax\u2019s Russell Galley said house prices fell despite a backdrop of rising employment in Britain and the government\u2019s decision to scrap stamp duty for first time buyers on homes selling for up to \u00a3300,000. \u201cAlthough employment levels grew by 102,000 in the three months to November, household finances are still under pressure as consumer prices continue to grow faster than wages,\u201d Galley said. Last week another leading mortgage lender, Nationwide, reported month-on-month house price growth of 0.6% in January, saying that the lack of new properties coming on the market was supporting the trend.",
