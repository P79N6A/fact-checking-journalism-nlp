      "bodyText": "The future of the embattled House of Fraser department store chain was hanging in the balance this weekend, as deadlock between its Chinese owner and lenders threatened to scupper its planned rescue package. The GMB and shopworkers\u2019 union Usdaw are watching from the sidelines, anxious about the risks of financial collapse for the store\u2019s 17,000 employees, who work in its 59 stores across the UK. The ailing retailer is seeking a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) \u2013 a complex insolvency procedure, which is increasingly being used by restaurateurs and retailers to shed loss-making sites \u2013 to allow it to restructure its store portfolio. In an 11th-hour battle, it has been seeking to win over its landlords to avoid collapsing into administration. The restructuring plan is a condition for a multimillion-pound cash injection from C.banner, the Chinese owner of Hamleys. The company is understood to have been reviewing its options after it upset its landlords by announcing a CVA, which would lead to the closure of at least 20 stores \u2013 a third of the total \u2013 without consulting them. The company insisted on Sunday that, while it had hoped to launch the CVA at the beginning of June, the board expected it to be agreed within the next 10 days. It said C.banner confirmed on 1 June that it would raise \u00a3124m through a share sale in Hong Kong, with the backing of its majority shareholder, to support the deal. Chairman Frank Slevin said: \u201cWe are on track with our plans to enter the proposed CVA agreement. The funding from C.banner is another important milestone in this complex process.\u201d He added: \u201cWe continue to have very constructive talks with our banks and other stakeholders who are positive about the plans.\u201d The overall restructuring deal will give control of the 169-year-old retail chain to C.banner, which is buying a 51% stake in its parent group. The buyout will involve the acquisition of shares from Nanjing Cenbest, part of China\u2019s Sanpower conglomerate, which will retain a minority stake. C.banner has agreed to pay a further \u00a370m for new shares leading to a \u201csignificant capital injection\u201d in House of Fraser. That is in addition to \u00a325m of cash that has been injected into the company by shareholders since March this year. Property companies Legal &amp; General and Westfield are among about a dozen landlords that have been plotting opposition to the CVA. Property companies can block the CVA and demand improved terms if creditors holding more than a quarter of the debts rebel against the company\u2019s proposed terms. If the CVA fails then it is likely that House of Fraser will collapse into administration \u2013 the latest retail casualty on the high street. House of Fraser said in a detailed statement in early May that it would reduce the size of the store portfolio, although insiders said no official hitlist of those earmarked for closure would be drawn up until the CVA is launched. Sources dismissed talk of specific stores closing \u2013 including the company\u2019s flagship on London\u2019s Oxford Street \u2013 as \u201cunfounded speculation\u201d. But industry experts have already suggested House of Fraser would have to consider closing at least 20 sites. The group has already been negotiating with landlords as part of plans to reduce its floorspace by 30% by slimming down a number of outlets. It is understood that deals have been struck to downsize stores in cities including Plymouth and Wolverhampton. House of Frasier\u2019s CEO, Alex Williamson, has fuelled fears that many stores are likely to close in regions where sales growth has slowed. Williamson said: \u201cIf we are to deliver a sustainable, long-term business supported by new liquidity, then we need to make difficult decisions about our underperforming legacy stores. \u201cI am conscious that inaccurate speculation only feeds the ongoing uncertainty for my colleagues in the business and I reassure them we will share further news when we have it.\u201d High street landlords are increasingly unhappy about struggling retailers using CVAs to effectively railroad them into agreeing to slash rents. The latest was Mothercare \u2013 which on Friday announced it is to close about 50 of its 137 stores by June next year with the potential loss of about 800 jobs after landlords approved a financial rescue package. New Look, Carpetright and the restaurant chains Carluccio\u2019s, Byron, Prezzo and Jamie\u2019s Italian have used the process to jettison unwanted outlets. Martin Greenslade, the chief financial officer of Land Securities, the UK\u2019s largest commercial property owner, said CVAs should only be used an emergency option to prevent collapse. \u201cWhere a business has genuine trading difficulties, a CVA can help provide the necessary breathing space to restructure and raise new funds to avoid administration,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general, we are happy to support these agreements. Where the operating performance of a business is fine but its ownership structure has excessive debt or management simply wants to improve its operating profits by reducing rents, we do not believe that the CVA process is fair or appropriate.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Bailey\u2019s focus last week was on high-cost credit and measures to curb the gouging of vulnerable consumers. This week the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority will be centre stage as he defends \u2013 or not \u2013 his plan to water down London\u2019s stock market rules for the likes of the oil behemoth Saudi Aramco, an issue that deeply divides the City. Already this year Bailey has fought a protracted battle over the publication of the FCA\u2019s report on how the Royal Bank of Scotland mistreated small business customers. The \u201cwhistleblower\u201d affair at Barclays, where the chief executive Jes Staley was fined \u00a3642,000 but cleared to stay in his post, was equally high profile. It goes to show what a varied life Bailey leads at the top of the regulatory tree. It is one that has made him favourite with the bookies to be the next governor of the Bank of England when Mark Carney departs next year, which probably reflects a few factors. First, he is now the country\u2019s most widely experienced financial regulator. After a long career at Threadneedle Street, he was switched to the FCA in 2016 to fix an organisation seen as lacking credibility and clout. Second, for all the criticisms that the FCA was slow and soft over RBS\u2019s Global Resructuring Group (GRG), Bailey retains respect in the market. When senior bankers gossip at City dinners over Carney\u2019s successor, they usually conclude that Bailey\u2019s front-runner status is deserved: he has run the FCA, a vast organisation that regulates 56,000 companies, without causing serious headaches for government. Third, he knows the European regulatory landscape backwards, a useful quality as Brexit approaches. So what does he make of reports this week that the Treasury and the Bank are quarrelling over the best Brexit strategy for the City? Chancellor Philip Hammond, it is said, wants to maximise UK firms\u2019 access to the EU market whereas Bank officials think the UK must not offer so many compromises that it ends up becoming \u201ca rule-taker\u201d. \u201cIf you put us [the FCA], the Bank of England and the Treasury into a room you would not find differences of view on basic planks of this,\u201d Bailey replies. \u201cDo we believe in open markets? Yes. Do we think it is to the benefit of everybody, including the EU, that we have open markets? Yes. Are we concerned about what we could call \u2018narrow\u2019 rule-taking? Well, it would be a problem. \u201cBut I think some of this is overblown. We can\u2019t have automatic rule-taking and I don\u2019t think any of us could be comfortable with that because Brussels rings you and tells you what the answer is. That is not a proposition any of us could live with. I don\u2019t think there is a sliver of difference between us on that one. I think we have made some progress. I think we have pushed back on the argument that you can\u2019t have financial services in any trade agreement.\u201d Bailey\u2019s frustrations are directed at the EU side. On transition arrangements, he says \u201cit is proving a bit hard to get engagement on the common technical solutions\u201d. The problem, he argues, is that \u201cif the EU says nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, then whatever is said you can\u2019t be certain.\u201d The UK has committed to a \u201ctemporary permissions\u201d regime for financial companies that would replace the current \u201cpassporting\u201d set-up. At a basic level, that will allow UK consumers to know that their car and home insurance policies with EU insurers such as Axa and Allianz will be be valid after Brexit. \u201cObviously we can\u2019t say that to EU consumers who have taken policies off UK firms because the UK government can only legislate in the UK ... It would be much better if we could do that across the board and say \u2018no, we are not going to put you at risk\u2019 and let the negotiation go on.\u201d On what he calls the eventual \u201csteady state\u201d arrangements, Bailey invites the EU to think again about \u201cmutual recognition\u201d, one of the UK\u2019s preferred options but not popular with EU negotiators. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-way process,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m always interested when I hear them say \u2018We don\u2019t like mutual recognition.\u2019 I think you probably do want us to recognise you, actually.\u201d In other words, it might be in the EU\u2019s interest to look at \u201coutcomes\u201d, in the negotiating jargon, rather than equivalence in rules. Bailey points to Mifid II, the huge pan-EU set of financial rules that came into force at the start of this year and set transparency and risk thresholds for shares, bond, commodities, derivatives and more. \u201cAll those things were calculated on the basis of an EU single market with the UK as part of it,\u201d he says, \u201cand the UK is the biggest part.\u201d If markets were split but the same Mifid rules were applied \u201cyou will not get equivalent outcomes because we have different size markets\u201d and the \u201cthere would be a big incentive for business to move one way or another at that point.\u201d The risk for the EU, in effect, is that more non-EU financial trade could gravitate to the City. \u201cSo I think you [the EU] want equivalent outcomes because that it is how you get protection on the level playing field, as it were.\u201d He concedes, however, that \u201cwe are still in the foothills of that argument\u201d. Any regrets about handling of the GRG affair? The tangle flowed from the fact that the investigation was commissioned by the FCA in 2014 as a \u201csection 166\u201d report, meaning its contents were supposed to be confidential. That position became near-impossible last year when leaks revealed the scale of RBS\u2019s mistreatment of small businesses. The FCA published a summary of the findings but demands for full disclosure were unrelenting. The stand-off ended only when the Treasury committee used parliamentary privilege to publish the whole report. \u201cThere were two things we were not prepared to do,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cOne, water down the report. And, two, break the law. I know this gets interpreted outside as \u2018we caved\u2019 but we can\u2019t break the law.\u201d The report itself, he argues, was \u201ctough but fair\u201d but the real answer would have been to hold a public inquiry in the first place, thereby forcing everything into the open. \u201cThe problem is that, if you look at the post-crisis history, we have had several governments in that period and none has wanted to go down the public inquiry route,\u201d he argues. As for the whole year it took to resolve the Staley case, he pleads the sheer volume of evidence in the email age and the need to interview a lot of people. \u201cI am keen that we speed up our processes where we can do so, but you are always balancing that against how much legal risk you are prepared to take,\u201d he argues. As for the big Bank gig, he\u2019s an old hand who knows not to offer a word out of line: \u201cI have got my hands full. I love this job.\u201d",

I think we have pushed back on the argument that you can\u2019t have financial services in any trade agreement.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bailey\u2019s frustrations are directed at the EU side. On transition arrangements, he says \u201cit is proving a bit hard to get engagement on the common technical solutions\u201d. The problem, he argues, is that \u201cif the EU says nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, then whatever is said you can\u2019t be certain.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7237ab46-4a9d-4c27-9859-6093f5928448\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Staying in the single market and customs union</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The UK could sign up to all the EU\u2019s rules and regulations, staying in the single market \u2013 which provides free movement of goods, services and people \u2013 and the customs union, in which EU members agree tariffs on external states. Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot. We would continue to have unfettered access to EU trade, but the pledge to \u201ctake back control\u201d of laws, borders and money&nbsp;would not have been fulfilled. This&nbsp;is an unlikely outcome and one that may be possible only by reversing the Brexit decision, after a second referendum or election.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The Norway model</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Britain could follow Norway, which is in the single market, is subject to freedom of movement rules and pays a fee to Brussels \u2013 but is outside the customs union. That combination would tie Britain to EU regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. A \u201cNorway-minus\u201d deal is more likely. That would see the UK leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. But Britain would align its rules and regulations with Brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access. The UK would still be subject to EU rules.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The Canada deal</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A comprehensive trade deal like the one handed to Canada would help British traders, as it would lower or eliminate tariffs. But there would be little on offer for the UK services industry. It is a bad outcome for financial services. Such a deal would leave Britain free to diverge from EU rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other \u201cnon-tariff barriers\u201d to trade. It would leave Britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. Many in Brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on Theresa May\u2019s direction so far.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>No deal</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by World Trade Organization rules. Tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the Irish border issue severe. In the short term, British aircraft might be unable to fly to some European destinations. The UK would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes. It may need to deregulate to attract international business \u2013 a very different future and a lot of disruption.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The UK has committed to a \u201ctemporary permissions\u201d regime for financial companies that would replace the current \u201cpassporting\u201d set-up. At a basic level, that will allow UK consumers to know that their car and home insurance policies with EU insurers such as Axa and Allianz will be be valid after Brexit. \u201cObviously we can\u2019t say that to EU consumers who have taken policies off UK firms because the UK government can only legislate in the UK ... It would be much better if we could do that across the board and say \u2018no, we are not going to put you at risk\u2019 and let the negotiation go on.\u201d</p> \n<p>On what he calls the eventual \u201csteady state\u201d arrangements, Bailey invites the EU to think again about \u201cmutual recognition\u201d, one of the UK\u2019s preferred options but not popular with EU negotiators. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-way process,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m always interested when I hear them say \u2018We don\u2019t like mutual recognition.\u2019 I think you probably do want us to recognise you, actually.\u201d</p> \n<p>In other words, it might be in the EU\u2019s interest to look at \u201coutcomes\u201d, in the negotiating jargon, rather than equivalence in rules. Bailey points to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/02/eu-bankers-work-around-the-clock-ahead-of-launch-of-mifid-ii-reforms\">Mifid II</a>, the huge pan-EU set of financial rules that came into force at the start of this year and set transparency and risk thresholds for shares, bond, commodities, derivatives and more.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll those things were calculated on the basis of an EU single market with the UK as part of it,\u201d he says, \u201cand the UK is the biggest part.\u201d If markets were split but the same Mifid rules were applied \u201cyou will not get equivalent outcomes because we have different size markets\u201d and the \u201cthere would be a big incentive for business to move one way or another at that point.\u201d</p> \n<p>The risk for the EU, in effect, is that more non-EU financial trade could gravitate to the City. \u201cSo I think you [the EU] want equivalent outcomes because that it is how you get protection on the level playing field, as it were.\u201d He concedes, however, that \u201cwe are still in the foothills of that argument\u201d.</p> \n<p>Any regrets about handling of the GRG affair? The tangle flowed from the fact that the investigation was commissioned by the FCA in 2014 as a \u201csection 166\u201d report, meaning its contents were supposed to be confidential. That position became near-impossible last year when leaks revealed the scale of RBS\u2019s mistreatment of small businesses. The FCA published a summary of the findings but demands for full disclosure were unrelenting. The stand-off ended only when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/20/mps-publish-full-unredacted-report-into-rbs-small-business-scandal\">the Treasury committee used parliamentary privilege to publish the whole report</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere were two things we were not prepared to do,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cOne, water down the report. And, two, break the law. I know this gets interpreted outside as \u2018we caved\u2019 but we can\u2019t break the law.\u201d The report itself, he argues, was \u201ctough but fair\u201d but the real answer would have been to hold a public inquiry in the first place, thereby forcing everything into the open. \u201cThe problem is that, if you look at the post-crisis history, we have had several governments in that period and none has wanted to go down the public inquiry route,\u201d he argues.</p> \n<p>As for the whole year it took to resolve the Staley case, he pleads the sheer volume of evidence in the email age and the need to interview a lot of people. \u201cI am keen that we speed up our processes where we can do so, but you are always balancing that against how much legal risk you are prepared to take,\u201d he argues.</p> \n<p>As for the big Bank gig, he\u2019s an old hand who knows not to offer a word out of line: \u201cI have got my hands full. I love this job.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "First it was Europe, Canada and Mexico. Now Donald Trump\u2019s focus has switched to the real target for his trade war: China. Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, is in Beijing for talks aimed at reducing America\u2019s $30bn-a month-deficit. Exports of Chinese high-tech manufactured goods are top of Ross\u2019s list. Make no mistake: Trump\u2019s strategy is a sign of weakness not strength. Countries that resort to protectionism normally do so for one of two reasons: to assist the development process when they are on the way up and to slow the pace of decline when they are in relative decline. In America\u2019s case, it is certainly the latter. Hefty tariffs of 40% on imported manufactured goods helped the US to build up its industrial power in the second half of the 19th century. By 1945, the US was by far the most powerful economy in the world, and supported trade liberalisation because it needed to find overseas markets for its goods. Protectionist tendencies never really went away. They resurfaced in the 1980s, when there was a panic about the threat posed by Japan. And behind the Trumpian bombast is a deep-seated fear that America\u2019s hegemony is threatened by China\u2019s rapid economic transformation over the past 40 years. If the struggle between the US and China merely leads to a trade war, the world can consider itself lucky. Historically, when a rising power challenges the existing top dog it has more often than not led to bloodshed. That\u2019s not remotely in prospect currently. In terms of the measures that count \u2013 technological sophistication, military clout and income per head of population \u2013 the US remains streets ahead. But China has been catching up fast. The first phase of its development, moving people out of the fields and into low-cost manufacturing, is over. A second phase, in which investment in higher education allows the economy to compete in sectors hitherto the preserve of the developed west, is well under way. China is not remotely interested in an international division of labour where the west does the clever stuff and it is left with the cheap end of the market. Trump\u2019s action sums up what Rebecca and Jack Harding are talking about in their new book, The Weaponisation of Trade (London Publishing Partnership). They argue that trade is a strategic concern; it is not just a matter that governments are happy to leave to market forces, decisions made in the boardrooms of multi-national corporations and by technocrats hammering out trade liberalisation deals at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva. \u201cTrade is more than an economic concept; and trade wars are not just protectionism,\u201d the two Hardings say. \u201cStrategic trade is one way in which countries can build their influence and power globally, and trade can be used in part as a substitute for direct military intervention.\u201d This marks a shift from the dominant political ethos in the decade that followed the collapse of communism, when the global economy boomed and protectionist pressures waned. Yet the notion that the world would be a better place if it were run in accordance with the free-trade beliefs of Adam Smith and David Riccardo did not survive the financial crisis of a decade ago. Even before the arrival of Trump, trade barriers were quietly going up, with 7,000 protectionist measures introduced since the financial crisis. Simultaneously, higher transport costs and security fears post 9/11 have made companies less keen on having long supply chains. There has been a tendency to localise rather than globalise production, which has chimed with a political mood that has prioritised national action over multilateral co-operation. Trump\u2019s America First approach is just one expression of the new mood and he will be confident that his tough-guy stance will go down well in the rust belt states that helped to elect him in 2016. That looks possible, even though the idea that the size of the US trade deficit is simply due to China abusing international trade laws is nonsense. To be sure, Beijing has been able to grow its exports by keeping its currency competitive. No question, there has been theft of US intellectual property rights. But the prime reason why the US is running such a sizeable trade trade deficit is that the opening of the global economy has allowed US corporations to outsource production to where it is cheaper, which is why the rust belt has been hollowed out. Low-cost imports from China led to lower inflation, which in turn meant interest rates were lower than they otherwise would have been. American households could load up on cheap credit to buy cheap Chinese imports. The US consumed more than it produced and spent more than it saved. China has funded America\u2019s spending habits by investing in US companies, US property and US Treasury bonds. The fear that Beijing could pull the plug on the US economy at any time by dumping its US holdings made previous administrations nervous. Trump has decided that the time for dithering is over, although his solutions seem somewhat bizarre. Tax cuts will encourage consumer spending while tariffs will raise the cost of domestic production. Higher inflation will mean a more rapid policy tightening from the Federal Reserve, which will slow the economy. A recession would would certainly bring down the trade deficit. The communities that saw their guts ripped out by de-industrialisation will welcome anything that offers hope of revival, but have been sold a lie. \u201cThey\u2019re closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks,\u201d Bruce Springsteen sang in My Hometown more than 30 years ago. \u201cForeman says these jobs are going boys and they ain\u2019t coming back.\u201d Sadly, he was right.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Soros is right: Europe faces an existential crisis, not least because of an addiction to austerity that has certainly contributed to Italy\u2019s summer of discontent. This makes it all the more urgent that the time-and resource-consuming wastefulness of Brexit be brought to an end, and the sooner the better. There are huge problems facing Europe: in addition to the domestic damage the prospect of Brexit is causing, it constitutes a huge distraction from the reforms the EU requires. It is no use waiting several years. The damage to our economy is manifest already, and the Treasury, Bank of England and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are not employing empty threats in concluding that things are set to go from bad to worse, as the investment so vital for productivity is postponed and the public and private sectors suffer recruitment problems. The follies of Brexit are impressively outlined in a new book, Saving Britain, by my colleague Will Hutton and my former colleague Andrew Adonis. They link the outcome of the referendum less to concerns about immigration (although there is no denying that was a factor) than to the cumulative impact of austerity \u2013 yet note that prominent Brexiter Lord Lawson is on record as saying that Brexit would help to complete the \u201cThatcher revolution\u201d. They provide us with a gripping account of how, through his influence on the public debate, \u201cMr Farage became leader of the Conservative party\u201d in all but name, adding: \u201cThe genius of the Eurosceptic right was to take none of the blame for its own domestic policies, but to offload it instead onto the EU and immigration.\u201d Sometimes it takes outside observers to add that extra insight into the social damage successive British governments have inflicted on areas of this country. Occasionally this service is provided by the New York Times, which did it last week in a report on a northern English town that exemplifies the ills identified by Soros. It was a front-page story \u2013 a piece of reporting that, despite objections to it from some quarters, brought home the impact of the drastic cuts in public spending, especially in central government grants to local authorities, since 2010. Its message could be summarised thus: after eight years of budget-cutting, Britain is looking less like the rest of Europe and more like the US, with a shrinking welfare state and spreading poverty. Notwithstanding the travails of Italy \u2013 not least the terribly high unemployment in the south of the country \u2013 European values still matter. Given the appalling state of so many of our public services, we as a nation need to take note of the way Scandinavian countries recognise that good public services have to be paid for by realistic levels of taxation. Alas, leaving the EU would only compound our problems. David Cameron made a potentially fatal commitment in his notorious Bloomberg speech of 2013: bowing to relentless pressure from Ukip and Eurosceptic MPs, he promised a referendum, in the hope of appealing directly to the people and overcoming the obstacles posed by the Tories\u2019 internecine strife. Harold Wilson did this in 1975 over Labour party divisions on Europe and succeeded. Cameron failed lamentably. Then came two serious mistakes by the government: first, they did not get across to the public the degree to which the smooth running of our economy depends on the results of 45 years of integrating into the EU. Second, having messed up the referendum, they did not take nearly seriously enough the advice from our former ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers, about how Brussels actually works, and how our negotiating strategy was based on an unfortunate blend of ignorance and fantasy. Of course, being a good \u2013 indeed outstanding \u2013 civil servant, Rogers did not put it quite like that. But that was the gravamen of his message. These \u201cnegotiations\u201d are getting nowhere, slowly. There is a train crash coming, probably in Northern Ireland, which to my mind poses an insoluble dilemma for Theresa May\u2019s \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d strategy. Bespoke \u201chave your cake and eat it\u201d arrangements? As Rogers said in a lecture in Glasgow recently: \u201cThere is no legal status of being a third country, which used to be a member, and therefore can be treated radically better than other third countries.\u201d In the first John le Carr\u00e9 novel in which George Smiley appears, the great man remarks of one character: \u201cHe was one of those world-builders who seem to do nothing but destroy.\u201d For me, that sums up the typical Brexiter.",

This makes it all the more urgent that the time-and resource-consuming wastefulness of Brexit be brought to an end, and the sooner the better. There are huge problems facing Europe: in addition to the domestic damage the prospect of Brexit is causing, it constitutes a huge distraction from the reforms the EU requires.</p> <p>It is no use waiting several years. The damage to our economy is manifest already, and the Treasury, Bank of England and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are not employing empty threats in concluding that things are set to go from bad to worse, as the investment so vital for productivity is postponed and the public and private sectors suffer recruitment problems.</p> <p>The follies of Brexit are impressively outlined in a new book, <a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/saving-britain.html\" title=\"\"><em>Saving Britain</em></a>, by my colleague Will Hutton and my former colleague Andrew Adonis. They link the outcome of the referendum less to concerns about immigration (although there is no denying that was a factor) than to the cumulative impact of&#xa0;austerity \u2013 yet note that prominent Brexiter Lord Lawson is on record as saying that Brexit would help to complete the \u201cThatcher revolution\u201d.</p> <p>They provide us with a gripping account of how, through his influence on the public debate, \u201cMr Farage became leader of the Conservative party\u201d in all but name, adding: \u201cThe genius of the Eurosceptic right was to take none of the blame for its own domestic policies, but to offload it instead onto the EU and immigration.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes it takes outside observers to add that extra insight into the social damage successive British governments have inflicted on areas of this country. Occasionally this service is provided by the <em>New York Times</em>, which did it last week in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/world/europe/uk-austerity-poverty.html\" title=\"\">a report on a northern English town</a> that exemplifies the ills identified by Soros.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a train crash coming, probably in Northern Ireland, which to my mind poses an insoluble dilemma for Theresa May</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was a front-page story \u2013 a piece of reporting that, despite objections to it from some quarters, brought home the impact of the drastic cuts in public spending, especially in central government grants to local authorities, since 2010. Its message could be summarised thus: after eight years of budget-cutting, Britain is looking less like the rest of Europe and more like the US, with a shrinking welfare state and spreading poverty.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the travails of Italy \u2013 not least the terribly high unemployment in the south of the country \u2013 European values still matter. Given the appalling state of so many of our public services, we as a nation need to take note of the way Scandinavian countries recognise that good public services have to be paid for by realistic levels of taxation.</p> <p>Alas, leaving the EU would only compound our problems. David Cameron made a potentially fatal commitment in his notorious <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/eu-speech-at-bloomberg\" title=\"\">Bloomberg speech of 2013</a>: bowing to relentless pressure from Ukip and Eurosceptic MPs, he promised a referendum, in the hope of appealing directly to the people and overcoming the obstacles posed by the Tories\u2019 internecine strife. Harold Wilson did this in 1975 over Labour party divisions on Europe and succeeded. Cameron failed lamentably.</p> <p>Then came two serious mistakes by the government: first, they did not get across to the public the degree to which the smooth running of our economy depends on the results of 45 years of integrating into the EU. Second, having messed up the referendum, they did not take nearly seriously enough the advice from our former ambassador to the EU, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/the-guardian-view-on-ivan-rogers-resignation-a-loss-at-a-crucial-time\" title=\"\">Sir Ivan Rogers</a>, about how Brussels actually works, and how our negotiating strategy was based on an unfortunate blend of ignorance and fantasy.</p> <p>Of course, being a good \u2013 indeed outstanding \u2013 civil servant, Rogers did not put it quite like that. But that was the gravamen of his message.</p> <p>These \u201cnegotiations\u201d are getting nowhere, slowly. There is a train crash coming, probably in Northern Ireland, which to my mind poses an insoluble dilemma for Theresa May\u2019s \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d strategy.</p> <p>Bespoke \u201chave your cake and eat it\u201d arrangements? As Rogers said in a lecture in Glasgow recently: \u201cThere is no legal status of being a third country, which used to be a member, and therefore can be treated radically better than other third countries.\u201d</p> <p>In the first John le Carr\u00e9 novel in which George Smiley appears, the great man remarks of one character: \u201cHe was one of those world-builders who seem to do nothing but destroy.\u201d For me, that sums up the typical Brexiter.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s decision to slap tariffs on imported steel and aluminium presents the rest of the world with a stark choice: fight fire with fire or play for time. Despite all the bellicose rhetoric that accompanied the well-signalled protectionist action from Washington, the latter course is the preferred option for now. Brussels and Beijing have already made it clear that they will respond to Trump\u2019s tariffs but are eager to avoid a full-scale trade war. In part, that\u2019s because both the EU and China are export-driven economies, and restricted access to the world\u2019s biggest market would hurt. With global growth showing signs of slowing, there is no real appetite for a rerun of the 1930s. But this is not the only factor. In trade circles, there is an acceptance that many of Trump\u2019s gripes are valid. The Chinese have been over-producing steel and aluminium, and dumping the excess output on the global market. There has been flagrant piracy of western intellectual property by China. The rules of the World Trade Organisation were made in the early 1990s and are no longer adequate now that China is a member. There is even some support for the US decision to gum up the WTO\u2019s disputes settlement procedure by blocking new appointments to the appeals body, because of concerns that its members are using the judicial process to make new binding trade laws. What the Europeans, the Japanese and others object to is how Trump is going about things. They believe that attempts to bully China into submission will meet with implacable opposition from a regime in Beijing determined not to lose face. America\u2019s traditional allies think that a better way to put pressure on China over steel would be through joint action using the established multilateral channels. Consistent with this approach, the EU is using the WTO process to challenge Trump\u2019s justification for the steel and aluminium tariffs. The WTO allows members to take action on national security grounds, but the EU says there is no such threat to the US in this case. It will argue that if Trump prevails, every country will use the same loophole to impose protectionist measures. The US for its part may walk out of the WTO if it can\u2019t decide for itself what is a national security issue. It will take time for the dispute to work its way through the WTO, and that offers one way out of the impasse. While China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, is in the lucky position of not having to worry about the voters, the US has midterm congressional elections in the US in November and a presidential race two years after that. Were the Democrats to seize control of the House of Representatives in the autumn, and Trump to prove a one-term occupant of the White House, the thinking is that US trade policy would shift back to a more traditional setting: acting multilaterally through the WTO to sort out contentious issues. This, though, assumes quite a lot of things: that the US does swing decisively to the left in the midterms; that the new Congress is willing and able to move US trade policy in a less protectionist direction; and that Trump is the first one-term president since George HW Bush lost in 1992. The current state of the US economy suggests that Trump\u2019s re-election prospects are brighter than his many political enemies imagine. Growth is solid, unemployment is low, real incomes are rising, and taxes have been cut. It is, of course, possible that the sweet spot has come too early and by the time of the 2020 election campaign, rising interest rates and slower growth will put an end to Trump\u2019s populist experiment. But there\u2019s no guarantee of this, which is why there are fears that Trump will double down on protectionism, pull the US out of the WTO and destroy the multilateral trading system. And which is why those fears are justified. Good news as pension deficits disappear Britain\u2019s pension schemes are in a state of near-permanent semi-collapse. Employers struggle with the vast liabilities and worsening deficits on their \u201cfinal salary\u201d schemes. But is it time to turn the pension frown upside down? Figures from JLT Employee Benefits, which advises big companies on their pensions, show that for FTSE 100 companies as a whole, deficits have virtually disappeared. The assets in the schemes (bonds and equities) are now equal to 99% of the projected liabilities. This is a stunning turnaround. In the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote in 2016, JLT said that the combined deficit of all UK private sector schemes was a record \u00a3500bn, \u201cwith no relief in sight\u201d. But relief was actually in sight. In May 2018, the combined deficit of all companies fell to just \u00a343bn, said JLT. The assets of pension schemes have jumped in value, partly because companies have put in more cash, partly because bond and equity markets have moved the right way. In further good news for companies (though not for you or me), it seems we\u2019re not going to live as long as we thought. Last year, the official Continuous Mortality Investigation said that we are no longer seeing the same rates of improvement in life expectancy as at the turn of the 21st century. Consultants PwC suggest this could shave up to \u00a3300bn off companies\u2019 pension burdens. Some analysts say that Britain\u2019s pension schemes are already in surplus. Lane Clark &amp; Peacock estimates a surplus of up to \u00a320bn. Last time this happened, finance directors slashed payments into schemes, taking \u201cpension holidays\u201d and paying out cash as dividends instead. This was shortsighted. But just because it was wrong then, don\u2019t count on companies not making the same mistake again. We are investigating the funeral market, but not the startling rise in UK mortality The funeral business \u2013 pardon the pun \u2013 is deadly. Shares in Dignity, the UK\u2019s biggest undertakers, plunged 13% to \u00a310.50 on Friday. Little more than a year ago they were changing hands at more than \u00a327. They first went south in January, when the company issued a profits warning, blaming intense competition and falling prices. It told the market it would have to cut prices by 25%, particularly in the \u201cbudget\u201d end of the business. To make matters worse for the firm, many of us, like David Bowie, are opting for cheap direct cremations, with no funeral service. Those who do want a traditional service are shopping around much more, using funeral-broking sites online and ringing around for quotes. It\u2019s a crowded market. We now have around 6,000 funeral homes, compared to 4,500 when Dignity first listed on the stock exchange in 2004. So it is curious that the Competitions and Markets Authority has chosen now to launch an inquiry into the market. It is worried that buyers are not receiving clear information on prices and services, and that people may be exploited at a vulnerable time. Maybe the CMA will find evidence of consumer detriment to consumers, but it will have to look hard. Far more worrying should be the surprise spike in deaths this year. One of the problems for the likes of Dignity is that, until recently, the number of deaths was falling as we lived longer. Yet in the first 20 weeks of this year, 15,000 more people died in England and Wales than is usual for the time of the year \u2013 and it can\u2019t be explained away by flu and cold weather. The trend was spotted earlier this year by Danny Dorling, professor of geography at the University of Oxford, and has continued since then. He points the finger of blame at a failing health and social services system. An investigation into whether funeral directors are giving us a good service is one thing. A more pressing investigation should be into why so many more people are dying.",

The pay levels have prompted outrage from a section of shareholders who have been advised to vote against the pay report of the FTSE 250 company, which owns Ladbrokes Coral and Foxy Bingo and has its headquarters on the Isle of Man. But will it make a difference? Voting against executive pay has become something of a given at AGMs this year, as has the failure of such efforts. Last month, AstraZeneca faced the wrath of investors when over a third of them failed to back the pharmaceuticals giant\u2019s remuneration report. The rebellion opposed a \u00a39.4m pay package for chief executive Pascal Soriot, even though this was a reduction from \u00a314.3m a year earlier. One of the biggest rebellions of the year came at turnaround specialists Melrose when almost 27% of shareholders who voted at its annual meeting in May failed to back its pay report, with leading City institution and top-20 shareholder Standard Life Aberdeen among the rebels. That vote came amid disgruntlement over a decision to pay a \u00a342m incentive scheme payout to each of four directors, but failed to stop the payments as they have already been made and shareholders are powerless to stop payments because the votes are only advisory. However, it was seen as a rap on the knuckles for a decision to hand out \u00a3167m to just four men \u2013 the executive chairman, Christopher Miller, the executive vice-chairman, David Roper, the chief executive, Simon Peckham, and the group finance director, Geoffrey Martin \u2013 and the company said it would review the existing remuneration arrangements. At the beginning of May, insurance group Direct Line had a shareholder rebellion when 23% voted against directors\u2019 pay. That focus was on the \u00a3657,000 basic pay awarded to new finance director Penny James, whose pay is 38% more than her predecessor\u2019s. At about the same time, 37.6% of shareholders voted against the Bovis remuneration report after a controversy over the pay package it awarded its interim chief executive. But, again, the revolt failed to stop the report, which was passed with the backing of 62.4% of the voters. Shortly before that, shareholders in housebuilder Persimmon had revolted against what was described as the excessive and unjustifiable \u00a375m bonus paid to chief executive Jeff Fairburn. The company\u2019s annual meeting saw shareholders get to their feet to show their outrage at the sums paid to him and other senior managers. In a vote, 64% of shareholders failed to support the payout. However, despite the investor anger, the pay policy was approved, as almost a third of shareholders abstained from the vote, and of those who voted, 51.5% cast in favour and 48.5% against. The annual meeting in Gibraltar this week will be the second time that executive pay has been questioned by GVC shareholders. Last year, 45% of investors failed to support the pay policy. Judging by the experience of other AGMs so far this year, Alexander and Feldman may not be too concerned about their wages. \u2022This article was amended on 4 June 2018 to clarify that the \u00a342m payment t0 Melrose directors was under an incentive scheme",
