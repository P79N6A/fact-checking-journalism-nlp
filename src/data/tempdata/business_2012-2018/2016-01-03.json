      "bodyText": "The rout in commodities prices that has wiped billions from the value of energy and mining companies across the world in the past 12 months will continue in 2016, according to economists, analysts and executives on the front line. Prices in a range of key industrial commodities plunged in 2015 as China\u2019s factories and appetite for raw materials slowed while supply, especially of oil and iron ore, increased. Bob Dudley, the boss of BP, said the price of oil, which lost 34% in 2015, could continue to fall in the first few months of 2016. \u201cA low point could be in the first quarter,\u201d Dudley has told BBC radio. Dudley predicted that prices could stabilise towards the end of the year, but would remain low for the forseeable future. \u201cPrices are going to stay lower for longer, we have said it and I think we are in this for a couple of years. For sure, there is a boom-and-bust cycle here,\u201d Dudley said. His words will sound a warning for investors across the globe when markets reopen on Monday, especially those in the resource-heavy UK and Australian markets. The commodity index used by Thomson Reuters fell by a quarter over the year to hit its lowest level since 2002. \u201cThe chances of an optimistic 2016 are bleak,\u201d Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong\u2019s Wing Fung Financial Group, said. \u201cSlowing economic growth and structural reforms in China might contribute to decreased demand for commodities.\u201c Further interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve will add to the pain by strengthening the US dollar and making many commodities more expensive for international buyers, he said. The smallest, niche agricultural commodities were the only bright spots in sight as weather and disease roiled crops, raising concerns about tightening supplies and boosting cocoa, cotton and orange juice. Among industrial commodities, iron ore prices tumbled 40% this year due to global oversupply and shrinking Chinese steel demand, marking a third year of losses. The rout is seen stretching into next year and will mean prolonged pain for resource giants such as BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Brazil\u2019s Vale, as well as for Australia\u2019s third largest producer Andrew Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Metal group. \u201cWe have a modestly higher price for iron ore of just over $50 by end-2016 but that does not rule out prices falling below $30,\u201d Caroline Bain of Capital Economics told Bloomberg. With all four committed to increased supply in a fight to the death against higher-cost producers, Bain predicted there would be casualties. \u201cIt is hard to see the big four cutting production by much. But we think production elsewhere \u2013 notably in China \u2013 will be cut at current prices or lower,\u201d Bain said. In coal, thermal prices fell almost a third in 2015, also hurt by waning Chinese demand and the rise of renewable energy, with Goldman Sachs and the International Energy Agency saying China\u2019s coal demand has peaked. Both iron ore and coal have shed around 80% in value since their respective historical peaks in 2011 and 2008. The downturn has hammered BHP, which has seen its share price fall by a third in Australia and by 40% in the UK, Rio and Anglo American, as well as merchants like Asia\u2019s Noble Group and Glencore, forcing them to shed jobs and sell assets. \u201cWe had the big party from 2005-2011, and now we are suffering the big hangover,\u201d Breakaway Research senior resources analyst Mark Gordon told AFP. \u201cThe so-called supercycle was a real anomaly in history, so the upward trend was an anomaly, and the downward trend is also an anomaly.\u201d Benchmark oil and natural gas prices have also slumped, down a third this year and two thirds since the rout began in 2014, as ballooning supply met slowing demand. \u201cHeadwinds [are] growing for 2016 oil,\u201d Morgan Stanley said this week, citing increases in global supply and a slowdown in demand, reflecting a market consensus that meaningfully higher prices are not expected before late 2016. The outlook is expected to trigger a fight for survival across the supply chain, including shippers and private oil drillers, while oil-dependent countries from Venezuela and Russia to the Middle East face smaller revenues. Prices of industrial metals also plummeted this year. Copper and zinc shed a quarter of their value, and nickel collapsed more than 40%, hammered by slowing growth in top consumer China. Some investors are hoping base metals are over the worst, but some fund managers and analysts expect further losses next year before miners make significant output cuts to offset slowing demand growth. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way, but 2016 will probably be another lost year for commodities, though we should see a bottom,\u201d said Tiberius Asset Management Chief Executive Christoph Eibl. \u201cThe supply overhang needs to be corrected, which will be painful because that means giving up market share and restructuring,\u201d Eibl added. \u201cI think this will happen next year.\u201d Gold, however, is showing no sign of recovery after sliding to a near six-year low earlier in December. The metal closed the year down about 10% for its third straight annual loss, on a stronger dollar and prospects that higher US interest rates will hurt demand for non-interest-paying bullion. Its outlook heading into next year does not look much better, with several traders and brokerages predicting a drop in prices to $1,000 an ounce or below early in 2016, before firming in the second half. Gold has largely been influenced by US data and the Fed\u2019s monetary policy. Even if the Fed rate hike path next year was slow, gold would take a hit, said traders.",

The number of high street shoppers from Monday 28 December to Friday 1 January was down 3% compared with the same period in 2014, according to research firm Springboard. A year ago, retailers had been celebrating a jump of 6.2%. Retail experts had predicted a stampede to the shops on Boxing day after retailers offered discounts topping last year\u2019s average of more than 50%. They are desperate to clear cold-weather clothing that has remained on the shelves during record mild weather. While Boxing Day had offered some hope of a pick-up in trade, the following week \u2013 which included a bank holiday \u2013 was poor. Shopper behaviour differed markedly in different parts of the country, with footfall down by almost 7% in Wales and by 5.8% in the West Midlands, but up in Scotland and the east of England by 11.3% and 4.5% respectively. In London and the south-east, the affluent engine of consumer spending, numbers were also in decline, dropping 4.5% and 3.3% respectively. But Springboard figures showed that some of this trade appeared to have migrated to shopping centres, where numbers were up 3.3% in Greater London and ahead by 8.8% in the south-east. As well as unexpectedly mild weather leaving little demand for winter clothing stock, shoppers are also thought to have been put off venturing out by heavy rainstorms and concerns about potential terrorist attacks. According to Springboard analyst Diane Wehrle, however, the two biggest factors influencing shopping trends were the increasing popularity of online shopping and consumers\u2019 expectations that retailers would start their discounting well in advance of Christmas. \u201cHigh street footfall has been low this year because of the move to online [shopping]. Retail parks have fared better, parly because they are often a place [where] shoppers can pick up a \u2018click-and-collect\u2019 order [placed on the internet]. \u201cBuilding on strong footfall experienced by high streets this time last year was always going to be a challenge, and these figures show there is a job to be done in 2016 in order for a positive uplift to be realised.\u201d The fashion chain Next, which has largely avoided early discounting, is due to report its Christmas trading performance to investors on Tuesday. It will be followed on Wednesday by John Lewis, while Marks and Spencer, Poundland and Signet Jewelers are due to update investors on Thursday. M&amp;S did cut prices ahead of Christmas but has otherwise worked hard to protect profit margins. Some of the gloom may be taken off poor performance from its clothing and general merchandise business if food sales are strong, but few believe M&amp;S will have a great deal to cheer about. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, is reportedly forecasting a 3% drop in M&amp;S\u2019s like-for-like sales, but analysts at Nomura think the decline could be as much as 5.5%.",

    "webTitle": "Major offshore wind operator plans \u00a36bn UK investment by 2020", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dong Energy, the biggest operator of offshore windfarms in Britain, has said it plans to spend a further \u00a36bn in the UK by 2020, convinced that the government is serious about supporting wind power. Vattenfall, another significant UK windfarm operator, says it too is \u201coptimistic\u201d about 2016 and is hoping to proceed with a turbine testing site off Scotland this summer. The statements of intent are a major boost to Amber Rudd, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, who has been under fire for cutting subsidies to solar and other low-carbon sectors despite signing up to the Paris climate change accord. Brent Cheshire, Dong\u2019s UK division chairman, said he had harboured concerns about government policies as little as two months ago, but had since been reassured by recent firm commitments to offshore wind. \u201cIt was a concern that it took as long as it did [for ministers to recommit to offshore wind] but we have now got it. I think there is the clarity we need to commitment to new investment,\u201d he explained. Cheshire said it made more sense for the government to back offshore wind than the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, which was going to prove a lot more expensive. But he also warned it would take time for companies to cut their offshore windfarm costs, and that hopes that this arm of the renewable sector could become subsidy-free as early as 2023 were \u201cnot realistic\u201d. Vattenfall has for years being trying to build a European offshore wind deployment centre off the Scottish coast in Aberdeenshire, but has faced legal opposition from American billionaire and Republican presidential hopeful, Donald Trump. The British supreme court has now ruled the project can go ahead. The centre would allow the Swedish-based company behind windfarms in Thanet and Kentish Flats to experiment with different kinds of turbines to see which are the most cost-effective. Vattenfall said it was upbeat about offshore wind after Rudd said last month she would support the industry as long as it brought costs down. \u201cWe are optimistic about offshore wind and although we still think there may be potential investment opportunities onshore we are more cautious about that,\u201d the Vattenfall spokesman said. Denmark-based Dong has spent \u00a36bn so far developing windfarms in Britain and now says it wants to double this amount in the next four years. This means pressing ahead with projects such as the giant Hornsea scheme off Yorkshire. Once completed, this scheme will become the world\u2019s first gigawatt-scale windfarm, 80 miles offshore. Hornsea\u2019s 240 turbines are scheduled to commence electricity generation by 2020 with the capacity to power 800,000 homes. Cheshire admitted that the intermittent nature of wind \u2013 and many other renewable energy technologies \u2013 meant back-up \u201cbaseload\u201d generation was needed but said this did not need to come from nuclear but could come via interconnectors - electricity cables from abroad. He also argued that offshore wind power was very predictable given the sophistication of modern weather forecasting systems.",

      "bodyText": "The convicted Libor trader Tom Hayes was initially held in isolation on the care and segregation unit in Wandsworth prison for 23 hours a day, according to a series of prison letters detailing his first months behind bars. Hayes said he was held in in the segregation unit for his own protection, and accompanied by three officers when allowed out for 30 minutes exercise in the yard, or to shower or collect meals. But the former UBS banker was told he had \u201cwon the lottery\u201d after being transferred to the relatively benign regime at Nottingham prison after 11 days. Hayes was sentenced to 14 years in August for fraud for his part in manipulating the Libor rate \u2013 the London interbank overnight lending rate used by banks to set interest rates. In December, the 36-year-old failed to have his sentence overturned but had his tariff reduced to 11 years at the court of appeal, by judges who considered factors such as his age, lack of seniority and a diagnosis of Asperger\u2019s syndrome. Hayes\u2019s sentence is one of the longest prison terms on record for UK white-collar crime. In a series of letters to the Times City editor Harry Wilson, Hayes wrote of his shock at being taken from court in handcuffs hours after dropping his son at nursery, moved to a holding cell where he was forced to use a plastic toilet with no seat or door in view of a guard, and then taken to Wandsworth and strip-searched. Hayes said he could hear the news on TV and knew his face was on the screen as he spent the first evening in a holding cell with other prisoners. Prison governors feared he would be targeted, and put him in his own cell in the segregation unit. He was considered at risk of suicide or self-harm and held under Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork procedures. Hayes wrote: \u201cBecause I was on ACCT, the light was turned on every hour to check I was still alive, and would disturb me yet further.\u201d Hayes, who said he was held in the same cell that the former publicist Max Clifford had occupied a few months earlier, was unable to sleep during his first days in prison, after having taken sleeping tablets during the trial. He wrote: \u201cI think in my early days I stood out \u2013 I probably still do \u2013 but certainly some people recognised me from the media coverage. People seemed to labour under the misapprehension that I had made \u2018trillions\u2019 for myself.\u201d Hayes said he had got himself vaccinated for hepatitis B, having initially refused the offer from a nurse \u201con the basis I couldn\u2019t fathom how I could catch a blood-borne virus. Later, after observing various biting incidents, I have now had my three jabs and am vaccinated.\u201d At his own request, Hayes was returned to the main prison, where he was put in a shared cell with a prisoner on remand for drugs offences. Hayes was transferred to Nottingham prison after 11 nights, which an officer at Wandsworth said meant he had \u201cwon the prison lottery\u201d, adding: \u201cPeople would give their right arm to get there.\u201d In letters typed from the Open University room at Nottingham, Hayes reported continued chaotic and uncomfortable conditions. He wrote: \u201cI lay on my bed and wondered how I had ended up here. I\u2019ve become quite the ornithologist; I used to watch the birds at Wandsworth, too. It seems so strange that we live in the same place but they are free, able to come and go from the trees that are on the \u2018free\u2019 side of the fence.\u201d He concluded: \u201cI guess I\u2019m becoming more immune to prison life now; being strip-searched has lost the embarrassment and indignity I felt at first. Drug overdoses and fights are de rigueur, and the monotony of life here takes over.\u201d Six other City brokers are currently on trial for rigging the Libor rate, having pleaded not guilty in October to conspiracy to defraud. Two other British traders, Anthony Allen and Anthony Conti, were convicted in the US in November for their part in the scandal, and face up to 30 years in prison when sentenced in March.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When London\u2019s Soho was hit by a cholera outbreak in the summer of 1854 it took a maverick to pinpoint the cause and come up with a way to contain it. Doctor John Snow rejected the established belief that cholera was airborne and he set out to disprove the miasma - or \u201cbad air\u201d - theory by plotting cases on a map. The physician\u2019s findings proved his theory that the disease was in fact being spread through contaminated water. He traced the outbreak back to a water pump. Snow\u2019s story is one of the oldest examples of someone asking the right questions, analysing a dataset and throwing up new insights into previously stubborn challenges. As such it is also one of the favourite tales told by Peter Madden, the man heading the government\u2019s Future Cities Catapult. The centre was established just a stone\u2019s throw from where Snow made his discovery to help modern-day innovators find ways to make smarter decisions about how to run cleaner and more efficient cities in the UK and beyond. The hope is that in 2016, so-called \u201csmart cities\u201d will map and analyse all manner of statistics, from household waste volumes to social care needs, to better direct their services. For anyone who fancies trying their hand at this blending of big data and big decisions, Future Cities Catapult has created a game for the Big Bang Data exhibition, now running at London\u2019s Somerset House until March. The idea is to demonstrate how data and new modelling methods can help policymakers set priorities and predict the impact of their decisions. In an era of spending cuts and pressing environmental problems, the potential rewards are huge, but reaping them is by no means simple. There are four obvious challenges. Firstly, there is the sheer quantity of data. As the Big Bang exhibition\u2019s title implies, there has been an information explosion in recent years, as we increasingly use our phones and computers to manage our day-to-day lives and leisure time. With every click, search and selfie, the mass of data expands. Experts predict a 4,300% increase in annual data generation by 2020. The second challenge is the quality of data. In the ever-growing hoard of information, some bits are more useful than others. Some are more reliable. In the past, researchers and policymakers could navigate this patchy world by putting datasets into a sort of hierarchy, ranging from a dodgy sponsored survey at the bottom up to official statistics at the top. Now, as the way we work and live changes, that old model no longer stands. Sensible businesses have been using their own data to shape decisions for years. Take supermarkets and the vast insight they gain from loyalty card schemes. Official data collection and statistics in the UK have been criticised for failing to keep up. Sir Charlie Bean is among those who say the UK\u2019s official statisticians need to move with the times if their figures are to capture the real state of a modern economy, where people shop online, work from coffee shops and invest in laptops more than lathes. The government has asked the former deputy governor of the Bank of England to lead a review of the country\u2019s economic statistics, and he reports back in March. His interim report published last month found \u201cstatistics have failed to keep pace with the impact of digital technology\u201d and he called for the Office for National Statistics to be more \u201cproactive\u201d in producing figures. Bean\u2019s interim report brings us to accessibility, the third challenge for those wanting to harness the economic power of big data. One of his key recommendations on future-proofing economic statistics was for the UK to unlock the vast hoard of data that the public sector collects in the course of its day-to-day business. There are vital privacy and security considerations, but used in the proper way, this data trove could improve GDP estimates, regional statistics and a host of other indicators. As Bean said: \u201cIt\u2019s nonsensical that different bits of the government don\u2019t speak to each other\u201d. The fourth challenge is the toughest to tackle, but also the most important - working out how best to use the growing mine of available data. When Snow found a pattern on his map of cholera cases, he already knew what he was looking for. He had a theory. Exploiting big data will take investment in training and a serious dose of open-mindedness. It will also require some unlikely collaborations. Pairings such as that between a biomedical research institution and the number cruncher who led a data revolution in the world of baseball. Paul DePodesta worked as Billy Beane\u2019s assistant on the Oakland Athletics baseball team and used data to change the way the team recruited players. His great success was retold in Michael Lewis\u2019s bestselling book, Moneyball and the eponymous Hollywood film. Now the Harvard economics graduate is turning his analytical hand to medicine by joining the Scripps Translational Science Institute (STSI). As assistant professor of bio-informatics, he will work on new ways to use the growing amount of data being collected from patients through advances such as genetic testing and wirelessly connected devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators. DePodesta sees no limits to where data can improve decision making, be it in baseball, banking or retail. As he points out, however, such shifts in thinking are far from inevitable. \u201cMedicine is just beginning to explore this opportunity, but it faces many of the same barriers that existed in those other sectors \u2013 deeply held traditions, monolithic organisational and operational structures and a psychological resistance to change,\u201d he said when the collaboration was announced. Snow could tell him a thing or two about resistance to change. Sadly for the 19th-century doctor, his findings about water and cholera were not taken seriously until after his death in 1858. That same summer, it took the \u201cGreat Stink\u201d, when the stench of the Thames at Westminster was so foul that MPs were forced out of parliament, to finally prompt politicians to rush through funding for a new sewer system for London. As the cleanup continues from devastating flood damage in the north of England and Scotland, people are quite rightly asking what it will take to catalyse serious action from this government. Homeowners and businesses want to know how much of the damage was predictable, and more importantly how much of it was preventable. Plans for smart cities, new digital strategies and sturdier statistics are all welcome, but any mention of the power of big data was notably absent from David Cameron\u2019s new year message. It certainly is not everything and cannot replace flood defences but, used smartly, it can help predict where they should go. More broadly, for a government intent on doing more with less, Snow and Moneyball, his modern-day successor, offer plenty of lessons.",

      "body": "<p>When London\u2019s Soho was hit by a cholera outbreak in the summer of 1854 it took a maverick to pinpoint the cause and come up with a way to contain it.<br></p> <p>Doctor John Snow rejected the established belief that cholera was airborne and he set out to disprove the miasma - or \u201cbad air\u201d - theory by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/mar/15/john-snow-cholera-map\">plotting cases on a map</a>. The physician\u2019s findings proved his theory that the disease was in fact being spread through contaminated water. He traced the outbreak back to a water pump.</p> <p>Snow\u2019s story is one of the oldest examples of someone asking the right questions, analysing a dataset and throwing up new insights into previously stubborn challenges.</p> <p>As such it is also one of the favourite tales told by Peter Madden, the man heading the government\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://futurecities.catapult.org.uk/\">Future Cities Catapult</a>. The centre was established just a stone\u2019s throw from where Snow made his discovery to help modern-day innovators find ways to make smarter decisions about how to run cleaner and more efficient cities in the UK and beyond.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/25/we-cant-allow-the-tech-giants-to-rule-smart-cities\">We can\u2019t allow the tech giants to rule smart cities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The hope is that in 2016, so-called \u201csmart cities\u201d will map and analyse all manner of statistics, from household waste volumes to social care needs, to better direct their services. For anyone who fancies trying their hand at this blending of big data and big decisions, Future Cities Catapult has created a game for the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bigbangdata.somersethouse.org.uk/\">Big Bang Data exhibition</a>, now running at London\u2019s Somerset House until March.</p> <p>The idea is to demonstrate how data and new modelling methods can help policymakers set priorities and predict the impact of their decisions.</p> <p>In an era of spending cuts and pressing environmental problems, the potential rewards are huge, but reaping them is by no means simple. There are four obvious challenges.</p> <p>Firstly, there is the sheer quantity of data. As the Big Bang exhibition\u2019s title implies, there has been an information explosion in recent years, as we increasingly use our phones and computers to manage our day-to-day lives and leisure time. With every click, search and selfie, the mass of data expands. Experts predict a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.csc.com/big_data/flxwd/83638-big_data_just_beginning_to_explode_interactive_infographic\">4,300% increase in annual data generation by 2020</a>.</p> <p>The second challenge is the quality of data. In the ever-growing hoard of information, some bits are more useful than others. Some are more reliable. In the past, researchers and policymakers could navigate this patchy world by putting datasets into a sort of hierarchy, ranging from a dodgy sponsored survey at the bottom up to official statistics at the top.</p> <p>Now, as the way we work and live changes, that old model no longer stands. Sensible businesses have been using their own data to shape decisions for years. Take supermarkets and the vast insight they gain from loyalty card schemes. Official data collection and statistics in the UK have been criticised for failing to keep up.</p> <p>Sir Charlie Bean is among those who say the UK\u2019s official statisticians need to move with the times if their figures are to capture the real state of a modern economy, where people shop online, work from coffee shops and invest in laptops more than lathes. </p> <p>The government has asked the former deputy governor of the Bank of England to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-economic-statistics-call-for-evidence/press-notice-charles-bean-kicks-off-review-to-future-proof-uk-statistics\">lead a review of the country\u2019s economic statistics</a>, and he reports back in March. His <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-uk-economic-statistics-interim-report\">interim report</a> published last month found \u201cstatistics have failed to keep pace with the impact of digital technology\u201d and he called for the Office for National Statistics to be more \u201cproactive\u201d in producing figures.</p> <p>Bean\u2019s interim report brings us to accessibility, the third challenge for those wanting to harness the economic power of big data.</p> <p>One of his key recommendations on future-proofing economic statistics was for the UK to unlock the vast hoard of data that the public sector collects in the course of its day-to-day business. </p> <p>There are vital privacy and security considerations, but used in the proper way, this data trove could improve GDP estimates, regional statistics and a host of other indicators. As Bean said: \u201cIt\u2019s nonsensical that different bits of the government don\u2019t speak to each other\u201d.</p> <p>The fourth challenge is the toughest to tackle, but also the most important - working out how best to use the growing mine of available data. When Snow found a pattern on his map of cholera cases, he already knew what he was looking for. He had a theory.</p> <p>Exploiting big data will take investment in training and a serious dose of open-mindedness. It will also require some unlikely collaborations. Pairings such as that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemlee/the-data-whiz-from-moneyball-is-getting-into-medicine#.cvOkXlNw3W\">between a biomedical research institution and the number cruncher who led a data revolution in the world of baseball</a>.</p> <p>Paul DePodesta worked as Billy Beane\u2019s assistant on the Oakland Athletics baseball team and used data to change the way the team recruited players. His great success was retold in Michael Lewis\u2019s bestselling book, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/jul/29/summer-readings-moneyball-michael-lewis\">Moneyball</a> and the eponymous <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/24/moneyball-review\">Hollywood film</a>. </p> <p>Now the Harvard economics graduate is turning his analytical hand to medicine by <a href=\"https://www.scripps.org/news_items/5588-moneyball-comes-to-medicine\">joining the Scripps Translational Science Institute (STSI)</a>. As assistant professor of bio-informatics, he will work on new ways to use the growing amount of data being collected from patients through advances such as genetic testing and wirelessly connected devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators.</p> <p>DePodesta sees no limits to where data can improve decision making, be it in baseball, banking or retail. As he points out, however, such shifts in thinking are far from inevitable. \u201cMedicine is just beginning to explore this opportunity, but it faces many of the same barriers that existed in those other sectors \u2013 deeply held traditions, monolithic organisational and operational structures and a psychological resistance to change,\u201d he said when the collaboration was announced.</p> <p>Snow could tell him a thing or two about resistance to change. Sadly for the 19th-century doctor, his findings about water and cholera were not taken seriously until after his death in 1858. That same summer, it took the \u201cGreat Stink\u201d, when the stench of the Thames at Westminster was so foul that MPs were forced out of parliament, to finally prompt politicians to rush through funding for a new sewer system for London.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>As the cleanup continues from devastating flood damage in the north of England and Scotland, people are quite rightly asking what it will take to catalyse serious action from this government. Homeowners and businesses want to know how much of the damage was predictable, and more importantly how much of it was preventable.</p> <p>Plans for smart cities, new digital strategies and sturdier statistics are all welcome, but any mention of the power of big data was notably absent from David Cameron\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/01/uk-in-one-of-the-great-reforming-decades-claims-david-cameron\">new year message</a>. </p> <p>It certainly is not everything and cannot replace flood defences but, used smartly, it can help predict where they should go. More broadly, for a government intent on doing more with less, Snow and Moneyball, his modern-day successor, offer plenty of lessons.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In a sport steeped in tradition, Martin Ryan has seen the occasional raised eyebrow at first sight of his new design for a horse\u2019s saddle. Unlike other sports, such as golf or cycling, where new technologies have been embraced, the world of equestrian events has remained largely static, resulting in a saddle that has not changed for centuries, he says. His attempt to bring horseriding into the 21st century comes in the form of the lightweight Bua saddle, a new take on the seat that uses modern materials and production techniques. In effect, it creates two saddles: one that fits the rider, and a second that both better fits the animal and allows it to move more freely. \u201cI was using perfectly good saddles, but they weren\u2019t particularly comfortable. People didn\u2019t really ask questions of them because they were there for so long that they had just become a norm,\u201d the Irish designer says. Ryan, now 32, started riding horses aged five, and competed in eventing and showjumping. Like others, he used a leather saddle that had a structural piece called the \u201ctree\u201d that supported the rider in a balanced position and was then padded underneath to fit the shape of the horse. The problem he saw with the traditional saddle was that this semi-rigid object was being wedged between two very different types of body \u2013 the rider and the horse. \u201cYou have a totally rigid object on a dynamic animal, and so when the horse\u2019s muscles are moving, then this is resisting it to some degree, depending on how well it fits the horse\u2019s back. Whereas if you offer a little more flexibility, you are just allowing a little more freedom for the horse.\u201d Although the saddles have only recently gone on sale, Ryan came up with the original design as a Dublin student 10 years ago. The idea drew on his detailed study of the biology and movement of the horse. The tree of the new saddle is a piece of thermoplastic composite bent into a U-shape, a cantilever design, which effectively separates the unit into two different saddles. One part of the saddle is customised for the rider and the other side of the curved tree is designed to fit the horse\u2019s back, allowing balance for the rider and comfort for the horse. There is a natural suspension as the two parts are joined at the front. This allows the weight of the rider to be more evenly distributed on the back of the horse, gives more shock absorption when the rider comes down on the back, and gives the animal more freedom to move, says Ryan. \u201cYou always want the rider to be as natural and as free as possible and not restrict movement, but at the same time you have to hold the rider in that balanced position in order to guide the horse. If you put some piece of clothing on you that is restricting you and then you have to go and jump over something, that is not going to assist your jumping. \u201cThe best situation is to not have anything on the horse\u2019s back, but we have to carry somebody, so it is how best to do that and still allow the horse to have free, unrestricted shoulder movement at the front. When a horse jumps, it has to gather up its front legs \u2013 if you are restricting, it can\u2019t gather up its legs and then it is more likely to knock the fence.\u201d Weighing 4.1kg (9lb), it is the lightest saddle on the market, he says, well below the 6-10kg average for conventional saddles. The shape and size of the saddle\u2019s tree caters for 80% of the market and the company plans to produce variations as the business expands. There is also adjustable suspension at the back of the saddle, which switches between sport and trekking modes. The modular system \u2013 under which parts of the saddle can be swapped in and out \u2013 allows it to be used for different equestrian disciplines. Ryan and his partners at Bua Sport are mainly hoping to sell the saddle to showjumpers, although it is also suitable for endurance, hunting and leisure riding. It is not thought ideal for horseracing, he says, though there are plans to develop a version for ponies and children in the future. Priced at around \u00a31,500, it retails at the lower end of the price range for professional-grade saddles, which typically sell for between \u00a31,100 and \u00a37,300, says Ryan. However, it still remains well outside the budget of most riding schools, which usually go for cheaper options at around \u00a3300. Since its launch in August, a decade after it won a Dyson award for design, 80 saddles have been sold, and the Irish company projects revenues of \u20ac1m (\u00a3730,000) for the first year. The UK is the next target, said Ryan, where 1.1m people ride a horse every month. In Belgium and Germany, equestrian activities rank second only to soccer in popularity, he said, and frequently amateurs will use professional-grade equipment. The sport remains conservative however, says Ryan, and change happens slowly. For some, the different colours of the Bua saddles are \u201ca shock to the system\u201d. For the main market to embrace the new design will take up to two years, Ryan says, after people see that the saddle will last. It has received positive reviews from some riders. Sam Dempsey, an Irish international event rider, said it was a step forward to make a ride more comfortable for the horse and easier for him to communicate with the animal. The UK equestrian market The value of the equestrian sector has jumped from \u00a33.8bn in 2011 to \u00a34.3bn across a wide range of goods and services, according to the British Equestrian Trade Association. Six out of 10 enthusiasts take part in competitions. Women make up 74% of the riders, and there has been an increase in the number of young people taking part. Spending on items associated with equestrian sports \u2013 hats, body protectors, clothes \u2013 has risen from \u00a3557m in 2011 to \u00a3560m, according to the association. Last year, an estimated \u00a33,600 was spent on each horse, compared with \u00a32,650 in 2011. \u2022 You can read our archive of Innovators columns here or on the Big Innovation Centre website, where you will find more information on how the centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and around the world.",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve never been a fan of the \u201csharing economy\u201d. Not that there\u2019s anything intrinsically wrong with Uber, Airbnb and their peers, it\u2019s just that there doesn\u2019t really seem to be much \u201csharing\u201d going on. It\u2019s more like adding a technological middleman to a rental market. Now having shaken up the taxi and hotel market, the sharing economy has its eyes on a new market: housing for the digital workforce. This time it may have gone too far. Leading the charge is WeWork, a company that has turned the yawn-inducing business of leasing office space into a $10bn valuation by trendifying the office experience and attracting like-minded businesses to \u201cshare\u201d its spaces. Sounds so much better than a lease, right? (Full disclosure: the Guardian\u2019s New York office is in a WeWork building). The strategy has paid off for the startup real estate company. It is now bigger than all but the three largest publicly traded office management firms, if only in terms of the value its investors place on it: it manages only a fraction of the number of square feet of office space. Now WeWork is betting that its new business model, WeLive, will generate some 21% of its total revenue, or $609.8m a year, by 2018. There are a couple of giant assumptions underpinning that forecast, beyond the obvious one that the world of venture capital and the startups it has funded, including the giant \u201cunicorns\u201d (private companies worth more than $1bn), may not remain in robust health. Even if the startup universe enjoys a blockbuster year in 2016, though, there are a few other considerations. First, the residential real estate scene in cities like San Francisco and New York is notoriously difficult to navigate economically, even if that\u2019s the very reason fueling some of the potential demand for WeLive and other co-living/co-housing solutions. More seriously is the question: to what extent will workers be content, long term, to be presented with these worker dormitories as alternatives to affordable independent accommodation? Within the technology universe there clearly will always be a subset of geeks for whom the line between work and life doesn\u2019t just blur, but never really existed in the first place. For them, being able to bunk in a micro-apartment conveniently located perhaps only a block or two away from their office, in a space where everything from cleaning to bill paying is handled on your behalf, is the answer to a prayer. At the other end of the spectrum are wannabes, those drawn to fast-growing cities and who hope to network their way to better jobs. Realistically, the amenities on offer in Brooklyn in the first shared living space to be opened by Common, another co-living company (backed by blue-chip venture capital companies like Maveron) are a lot better than those you\u2019d find in a typical college dorm. The rental rates, at $1,800 to $1,950 a month, are affordable relative to the cost of a Brooklyn apartment when you consider that utilities, basic furniture, and basic supplies (salt and pepper, cleaning stuff) are thrown in plus access to the common areas. But if you move into Common, you\u2019re not getting an apartment \u2013 just a single bedroom, which is only 100 to 150 square feet. The mattress may be a Casper, but that\u2019s still tiny. For comparative purposes, the median size of a studio apartment in Manhattan is a whopping 550 square feet, and to rent that, you\u2019d pay on average about $200 a month more, although you\u2019d have to hunt around. (Of course, you\u2019d be paying for your own paper towels, and have to bring your own furniture.) From hacker hostels to luxury accommodation, however, co-living offerings are thriving \u2013 as, it seems, are the number of millennials willing to pay a premium price for the ability to connect with one another in what can feel like frenetic, large and overwhelming cities where everyone is focused on work. Companies like Krash and Pure House are profiting from this wave. Some offer meditation classes, others potluck dinners and networking opportunities. Wi-Fi is a given, as are granite countertops in the kitchen spaces. It\u2019s as if the boarding houses of the early industrial era and legendary residences like Manhattan\u2019s Barbizon Hotel for Women got a 21st-century high-tech, high-gloss makeover. What they all have in common, however, is the cost. Each of these companies lives in hope of becoming the next high-growth success story; to do so, it must reap a big profit from those millennials renting rooms. Previous generations of young hopefuls moving to the big city and sharing accommodations (throwing up temporary walls to divide a studio into a one-bedroom apartment or creating an extra bedroom out of part of a living room) did so in order to save money, whether to put toward a down payment, pay off student loans or simply to spend on vacations. It\u2019s hard to see how they can accomplish that these days, if they opt for these co-living units. The cost is carefully calibrated: certainly cheaper than rental units (and more available, especially in some markets, like San Francisco, where there is a dramatic shortage of affordable rental housing) but still far from inexpensive, especially for someone in their 20s just starting out. Then, too, the profit motive has driven some to cut corners. Consider one San Francisco co-living arrangement offered by Vinyasa Homes Project: $1,800 for a bunk bed in a small shared room. It\u2019s not as bad as it could have been; the tenant who went undercover on behalf of a Bay Area television station to check out the shared house (with 30 housemates) found that some rooms had four roomies in two bunkbeds. At least the kitchens were well-stocked, she reported. At their best, co-living and co-housing arrangements can be wonderful options. I\u2019m not sure that when tenants are desperate to find some kind of place to live and turn to hacker dorms or other sharing options as alternatives, as they increasingly do in cities like New York and San Francisco where cost and availability of rental housing are big issues, this is going to be the best case scenario for many. Even if it\u2019s cheaper and more accessible, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s optimal, and certainly city governments can\u2019t assume that this is a model that will come close to solving an affordable housing crisis for millennials. Then, too, I can\u2019t help my mind flitting back to the old Dickensian image of the workhouse. You lived and worked in the same place, and you worked in order to earn your keep. With the gap between work and life narrowing to a mere sliver \u2013 one advocate of co-working and co-living studied a Chicago design, involving a glass wall in the bedroom that could be used as a whiteboard for work during the day and a screen on which you could screen the latest Netflix drama at night \u2013 are we heading toward a deluxe, 21st-century version of a workhouse where technology employers can call on our services night and day? There are plenty of human arguments in favor of sharing our living arrangements, but it should be those, rather than the need to network, to save $150 a month, the inability to find an affordable alternative, that dictate the decision to share a house or an apartment in our 20s, 30s, or \u2013 for that matter \u2013 in our middle years or as seniors. It should be a voluntary association \u2013 as should the selection of our housemates \u2013 rather than driven by the economic interests of our employers and the financial incentives of the companies trying to justify a 100% jump in the value of their company in less than a year by commanding big rental fees. The sharing economy may just have its limits. The extremes of co-housing, such as sharing a single small bedroom and two bunk beds with three other people, may turn out to be one of them.",

      "bodyText": "A new year and, for bankers, it seems, a new regime. Not a tough new rule book which would help regulators to clamp down on the outrageous behaviour that caused the 2008 crisis and the ensuing economic recession, but a regime in which an official review into the culture of banking has been abandoned and the government has U-turned on a pledge to toughen up the rules holding senior bankers to account. What has prompted this change of heart? Have the bankers mended their ways after the $150bn (\u00a396bn) of fines imposed on major banks since 2008? (Those fines, incidentally, have deprived the real economy of $3tn of credit, holding back growth around the world.) Perhaps rules to clamp down on bankers\u2019 bonuses have finally started to erode the \u201cgreed is good\u201d culture of the City? Or have banks started to treat their customers with respect after paying out \u00a327bn in compensation for sustained mis-selling of payment protection insurance? There is little evidence to suggest any of this has happened. In the coming months (possibly weeks) Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 rescued with \u00a345bn of taxpayer money \u2013 is expected to hand over billions of dollars to the US authorities because of how it sold off dodgy packages of mortgage debt in the run-up to the financial crisis. While RBS might try to pass the penalty off as a \u201clegacy issue\u201d, it is also awaiting the outcome of a review by Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority into its treatment of small business customers. Barclays \u2013 still being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office over the way it raised money from Middle Eastern investors to avoid a taxpayer bailout \u2013 provides the clearest illustration that fines do little to change behaviour. On the day after it was fined for rigging Libor in 2012, one of its traders was busy fixing the price of gold despite the immediate public backlash following the interest rate manipulation penalty. When it comes to pay, bankers are also having the last laugh. The bonus cap imposed by the EU, instead of putting a lid on excess, has resulted in bankers getting a boost to their fixed pay through new handouts alongside their salaries and bonuses. Data last week showed how four US banks paid out at least \u00a3736,000 to almost 900 individuals in 2014. The 2015 bonus season is about to begin, and will no doubt be just as lucrative. On the crucial matter of how banks treat their customers evidence of reform is also thin. Lloyds Banking Group has been fined for a bonus culture that put staff under pressure to sell. Santander also showed it had scant regard for its customers by naming Chris Sullivan as its new corporate business chief at 8pm on the day before Christmas Eve. Sullivan left RBS \u2013 where he was deputy chief executive \u2013 exactly a year ago after being forced to apologise to Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee. Tyrie had accused him of being \u201cwilfully obtuse\u201d. This is the backdrop against which a more softly-softly approach is being adopted for big City firms, no doubt in a bid to ensure that HSBC does not move its headquarters out of the UK. George Osborne appears to be in some confusion. In November he was talking tough, saying bankers were getting off more lightly than shop lifters. But a few months earlier the chancellor had set out his hopes for a \u201cnew settlement\u201d with the City, signalling a more relaxed approach after being released from a coalition government. It seems to be a good moment for Tyrie \u2013 who presided over the parliamentary commission on banking standards set up in the wake of the Barclays Libor-rigging fine \u2013 to step forward. His committee is the one hope for making sure that bankers will not be able to sleep easy in 2016. Ashley will struggle to copy John Lewis Sports Direct\u2019s attempt to turn itself into another John Lewis will begin in earnest this week. Mike Ashley\u2019s comment that he wants to make Sports Directhis chain the best employer on the high street behind John Lewis was unprecedented. In the coming months we will see whether he means what he says or whether the 15p pay rise for staff was, as trade union Unite claims, a PR stunt. As ever with Ashley, people will look for ulterior motives. He was forced into this position by a Guardian investigation last month into working conditions at the Sports Direct warehouse in Derbyshire and by investor impatience with SD\u2019s shares. Key things to watch in 2016 are how the retailer changes its employment practices and its share price. The more the shares fall, the more Ashley will be pressured into sweeping changes. The shares have been under strain since a handful of City analysts claimed Sports Direct may be past its peak. The company\u2019s pile-it-high-and-sell-it-cheap approach has attracted bargain-hungry shoppers, but its reputation has been tarnished with customers and key suppliers. Major brands such as Adidas and Nike have become unhappy with Sports Direct\u2019s presentation of its products and turned instead to JD Sports to launch new trainers and football shirts. In 2015, Sports Direct shares fell almost 20% while JD shares more than doubled. Sports Direct is revamping its stores and moving to larger, out-of-town locations, but this could deter the canny customers who have made the company what it is. Some of Sports Direct\u2019s overseas businesses are also struggling, so Ashley and his lieutenant Dave Forsey have a lot on their plates. While the rest of the world starts a new year by looking ahead, retailers begin January by looking back. Christmas trading updates kick off this week with John Lewis, which is expected to set the benchmark for performance as well as working practices. Ashley and Sports Direct are a very long way from both. This rail fare rise is unreal By the standards of recent years, commuters may feel they have escaped lightly as they return to work with rail fares having increased by a mere 1.1% after the weekend\u2019s annual rise. Even among the worst-hit season ticket holders, few will see their train operator lift more than an extra \u00a360-\u00a370 a year from their wallets. But before passengers thank George for small mercies, let\u2019s not allow the chancellor to persist with his claim of a real-terms \u201cfreeze\u201d on fares. The rate by which they are rising is pegged to the retail price index, a measure the government scorns when it comes to other areas. Inflation as generally counted \u2013 the CPI measure \u2013 is zero. This is, in real terms as well as on the bank statement, another of the manyfare rises, small or large, overt or by stealth, that have compounded and accrued to make Britain\u2019s privatised railway the most expensive in Europe. And now, that little bit more so.",

Something to look forward to, isn\u2019t it? Inundated by flood forecasts As the flood waters (hopefully) subside, this week provides another opportunity for further heroic contributions to the clear-up effort. Yes, economists will be pumping out more and more reports on what the floods will mean for the UK economy, as they attempt to fill column inches almost as effortlessly as the rains have stocked York\u2019s cellars.

It might be proved right about that, but, if it is, rival KPMG will be wide of the mark, with its estimate putting the cost at more than \u00a35bn.

      "bodyText": "As I depart this pleasant berth to cover politics for the Guardian, after almost 15 years writing about the twists and turns of the global economy, there are plenty of things I will leave behind lightly \u2013 not least a dusty pile of unread books \u2013 but, if you will excuse the self-indulgence, dear readers, here are a few things I\u2019m missing already: Nerds Call them what you like: wonks, number-crunchers, analysts, every field has its experts; but economists are in a class of their own. With their baffled insouciance about anyone who fails to share their interpretation of the facts \u2013 and on occasion, blind fury about the stubborn irrationality of politicians, regulators, and most of all their rival economists, they are an extraordinary tribe. Special mention must go to Danny Blanchflower and Andrew Sentance, a pair of likable former Bank of England rate-setters, who have turned a perfectly legitimate disagreement about the course of monetary policy into a grumpy Twitter spat that has so far lasted several years. Charted waters Politics has its fair share of charts too \u2013 psephologists like nothing better \u2013 but economists\u2019 penchant for telling a story in a few grabby graphics is hard to beat. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, must be particularly commended: one recent speech alone included charts of labour productivity since 1750; the average real wage of unskilled construction workers since 1270; and the likelihood that different classes of worker are at risk of being replaced by robots. Jobsworths, Bank of England style Spending a couple of hours locked (literally) in the basement of the Bank of England\u2019s elegant building on Threadneedle Street, thumbing through a hefty pile of policy documents, in case any of their arcane contents leaked out in advance, was not fun at the time. Yet I\u2019m already starting to feel nostalgic about being hustled downstairs, past the whiff of musty old books in the Bank\u2019s archives, and waiting in a hushed cellar for the speaking clock to declare that it\u2019s twelve noon and the ladies and gentlemen of the press can reveal to the world that \u2013gasp! \u2013 interest rates will remain unchanged for the umpteenth month. And they gave us tea and biscuits. Bankers unbound It may not be good news for the prospects of rebuilding Britain\u2019s recession-scarred economy to a radical new blueprint, but there\u2019s something almost reassuring about the implacable swagger of the well-upholstered denizens of the City and Canary Wharf. Libor-fixing, PPI mis-selling, aiding and abetting tax evasion \u2013 the sector\u2019s list of misdemeanours is no less appalling for being oft-rehearsed. Yet last week\u2019s decision by supine watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority to drop its review of the culture inside Britain\u2019s financial firms felt a bit like the final, decisive slamming shut of a window of possibility that opened when Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers collapsed, during which it appeared to be a genuine possibility that the power of high finance over public life would be decisively curtailed. We could weep at the failure of the establishment to rein in the financial sector, but new year is a time for looking on the bright side, so let\u2019s salute the swashbuckling resilience of Britain\u2019s bankers \u2014 perhaps with a glass of something bubbly. Sweet potatoes in, satnavs out For fashionistas, catwalk shows determine which hemlines and fabrics are the must-haves. For economists, it\u2019s the consumer price inflation basket. Once a year, the Office for National Statistics reshuffles the list of goods it uses to work out if prices are going up, down or sideways. It won\u2019t tell you what you\u2019ll be wearing next year, but in 2015 we learned, among other things, that sweet potatoes and protein powder are essential. Yoghurt drinks and satnavs, not so much. The price of everything Oil, companies, government debts, cocoa futures: financial markets put an instant price on everything, moment by moment. They are reckless, irrational and inconsistent; they can only focus on one thing at a time (right now, mostly what Janet Yellen does next); and they can urge us on to hubris, like the giant ticker of Enron\u2019s share price that scrolls relentlessly across the stage in Lucy Prebble\u2019s play retelling the rise and fall of the Texas energy trader. Yet for all their faults, the ups and downs of the markets are the closest thing we have to the heart-rate trace of financialised global capitalism and, try as you might, they\u2019re relentlessly compelling. The great eurozone soap opera With the dastardly Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the heroic-but-flawed Yanis Varoufakis, and the dashing Mario Draghi, the eurozone\u2019s near-collapse has been the story that just keeps on giving over the past five years. It has everything: human drama, high politics \u2013 and ultimately, a clash of economic theories. Perhaps the uneasy calm with which 2015 drew to a close will continue throughout the next 12 months; but with Greece continuing to suffer eye-watering unemployment and deep public spending cuts, there\u2019s scant hope of that. Scrambling for synonyms You say quantitative easing; I say recession-busting bond-buying spree. You say like-for-like retail sales declined; I say Britain\u2019s cash-strapped consumers tightened their belts. Economics news is often in dire need of being rendered less dry and more accessible. We don\u2019t always succeed, but it\u2019s great fun trying. Over and out.",

      "body": "<p>As I depart this pleasant berth to cover politics for the <em>Guardian</em>, after almost 15 years writing about the twists and turns of the global economy, there are plenty of things I will leave behind lightly \u2013 not least a dusty pile of unread books \u2013 but, if you will excuse the self-indulgence, dear readers, here are a few things I\u2019m missing already:</p> <p><strong>Nerds</strong><br>Call them what you like: wonks, number-crunchers, analysts, every field has its experts; but economists are in a class of their own. With their baffled insouciance about anyone who fails to share their interpretation of the facts \u2013 and on occasion, blind fury about the stubborn irrationality of politicians, regulators, and most of all their rival economists, they are an extraordinary tribe.</p> <p>Special mention must go to Danny Blanchflower and Andrew Sentance, a pair of likable former Bank of England rate-setters, who have turned a perfectly legitimate disagreement about the course of monetary policy into a grumpy Twitter spat that has so far lasted several years.</p> <p><strong>Charted waters</strong><br>Politics has its fair share of charts too \u2013 psephologists like nothing better \u2013 but economists\u2019 penchant for telling a story in a few grabby graphics is hard to beat. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, must be particularly commended: <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2015/speech840.pdf\" title=\"\">one recent speech alone</a> included charts of labour productivity since 1750; the average real wage of unskilled construction workers since 1270; and the likelihood that different classes of worker are at risk of being replaced by robots.</p> <p><strong>Jobsworths, Bank of England style</strong><br>Spending a couple of hours locked (literally) in the basement of the Bank of England\u2019s elegant building on Threadneedle Street, thumbing through a hefty pile of policy documents, in case any of their arcane contents leaked out in advance, was not fun at the time.</p> <p>Yet I\u2019m already starting to feel nostalgic about being hustled downstairs, past the whiff of musty old books in the Bank\u2019s archives, and waiting in a hushed cellar for the speaking clock to declare that it\u2019s twelve noon and the ladies and gentlemen of the press can reveal to the world that \u2013gasp! \u2013 interest rates will remain unchanged for the umpteenth month.
