      "bodyText": "Britain has slipped behind Brazil in the global economic league table. The Bank of England has now kept the official cost of borrowing at 0.5% for three years and is part way through a third dose of electronic money creation. Living standards are on course to fall for a third year in a row, and the Institute for Fiscal Studies says that poor households and families with children will bear the brunt of government austerity over the coming year. Pressure is mounting on George Osborne to scrap the 50% income tax band, while Vince Cable expresses frustration about the government's lack of a \"compelling vision\" \u2013 an accurate assessment, if a cheeky one given that the business secretary is part of the team responsible for this mess. In short, the last seven days offered little reason to be optimistic about the UK economic recovery. Only Nissan bucked the gloom by announcing it will build a new small car at its plant in Sunderland, welcome news for a manufacturing sector where output, despite a 25% depreciation of sterling, is flat-lining. The Economist recently published its \"Proust index'', a measure of how much time had been lost by the recession. In Britain the clock has been turned back to 2004, and the hands are moving forward at a painfully slow pace. Despite a monetary and fiscal boost unprecedented in peacetime, there is no recovery to speak of. The recovery here has been weaker than in the US, Germany, France and Canada, and was slower than in Japan until the tsunami of a year ago. Explanations trotted out for this woeful performance include the likelihood that the official figures are wrong, that the UK has been hit harder than other leading industrialised countries due to the importance to the economy of the City, and that cuts to public spending have derailed the recovery. As Capital Economics has noted, however, official data is as likely to be revised down as up, Britain's financial services sector is no bigger as a share of the economy than that in the US, and most public spending cuts are still to come. None of the standard explanations, therefore, is convincing. Even so, there is a belief that recovery will come eventually. The Bank of England assumes that if it keeps bank rate low enough for long enough while continuing to print money, demand will pick up and the economy will return to its trend rate of growth. George Osborne is working on the basis that reducing government borrowing, cutting business taxes and red tape, and liberalising planning laws will create a stronger and bigger private sector to fill the gap left by the paring back of the public sector. The confidence of the Bank and the Treasury may well be justified, although on the basis of what has happened to the economy not just recently but over many decades it looks ill-advised. Here's a potted history of the century that has elapsed since Britain was still \u2013 just about \u2013 the world's superpower. Initially, there was over-reliance on the old staple industries of the first Industrial Revolution and the first of many macro-economic blunders with the decision to go back on the gold standard at the pre-first world war parity. Britain was slow to develop the newer industries such as electronics and chemicals, but was starting to do so in the 1930s when the second world war broke out. After 1945, a glorious opportunity to clean up while Germany, France, Italy and Japan were on their knees was squandered. Imperial delusions, military over-stretch, complacency, amateurism, weak management, and poor industrial relations all contributed to under-performance relative to rival western nations. Various remedies were tried, none of which worked for long. Britain has, for decades, been a nation that has lived beyond its means, as shown by the relentless deterioration in the balance of trade and the tendency to have a higher inflation rate than countries where consumption and production have been better balanced. The oilfields of the North Sea, now running dry, cushioned the country from this reality. Since the Bank of England abandoned direct controls on credit in the early 1970s, the economy has been prone to periodic debt binges, which have generated asset-price bubbles and, for a time, artificially boosted growth rates. Deregulation of the City in the 1980s meant even bigger debt bubbles, and entwined borrowers and lenders in a death embrace. Meanwhile, the productive side of the economy shrivelled in the four gruesome recessions of the mid-1970s, the early 1980s, the early 1990s and the one that began in 2008 and has yet to end. You don't need to be a genius to work out what happens next. After a while, the credit machine will crank its way back into life. The availability of cheap money will eventually generate a recovery based on consumer debt and rising house prices. Imports will rise, flows of hot money into the UK will drive up the pound and make exports less competitive. The whole, dreary cycle will repeat itself. Osborne and Sir Mervyn King are deluding themselves if they think that a third, a fourth or even a fifth bout of quantitative easing will solve the underlying problems of the UK economy. As things stand, the choice appears to be between permanent slow growth or short booms followed by protracted hangovers. Either way, without the financial balm of North Sea oil revenues, it will become harder and harder to maintain decent levels of public services and welfare provision. Debate about the economy in the UK tends to be absurdly short-termist. At the moment, the focus is on whether the government's deficit-reduction plan is too rapid and whether the 50% tax rate will generate any extra revenue. These are important issues, to be sure, and there is some interesting work being done in both areas. A paper by Tatiana Kirsanova and Simon Wren-Lewis in the latest Economic Journal, for example, argues that the optimal pace of debt reduction needs to be slow to avoid adverse fiscal feedbacks on the economy. Richard Murphy produced a report for the TUC last week in which he used HMRC data to show that the 50% tax rate should raise \u00a36bn in 2011-12. Ultimately, though, the challenge for the UK is to find a way of weaning itself off debt. In this respect, Cable's suggestion last week that RBS should be used as a new British investment bank, with a clean balance sheet and a mandate to lend to sound businesses is the first decent idea to emerge from Whitehall in a very long time. This is precisely what needs to happen to rebuild the UK's productive base and to ensure a foothold in the growth industries of the future. It has taken far too long for the penny to drop, but better late than never.",

      "standfirst": "After years of downplaying its significance, Guernsey and Jersey will admit to the high court this week that losing tax-exempt status would be devastating", 
      "body": "<p>Lawyers for the Channel Islands will travel to the high court in London this week in a last-ditch effort to block a move to clamp down on the islands' VAT-exempt e-commerce operations, which sell hundreds of millions of pounds of CD, DVDs and other goods over the internet.</p> <p>After years of playing down the scale of VAT-avoiding websites based on Jersey and Guernsey, the islands are now claiming the closure of this industry would be a \"catastrophe\". They are taking their case to a judicial review in the hope of blocking imminent plans to close a tax loophole that has allowed their offshore mail-order business to quietly mushroom to a substantial scale over almost a decade.</p> <p>Among the retailers with the most active arrangements involving the Channel Islands are four of the UK's largest online shopping sites: Amazon, Play.com, Tesco and HMV.</p> <p>The Channel Islands want the UK courts to stop the chancellor using this month's budget to push through a crackdown on the VAT dodge, which would outlaw it from 1&#xa0;April.</p> <p>Goods that are purchased and imported from outside the EU for less than \u00a315 currently qualify for a VAT waiver under a European tax rule called low value consignment relief (LVCR), drafted almost 30 years ago. The relief was originally designed to expedite trade, ensuring that perishable items did not get stuck for too long in the postal system.</p> <p>In papers filed ahead of this week's hearing, lawyers for Jersey's economic development minister Alan Maclean says: \"If this proceeds it will result in more than a 50% increase in the overall level of unemployment in Jersey, with the consequent social and economic consequences \u2013 that is to say, a catastrophe.\"</p> <p>It is a dramatic shift from Jersey's past position, which for years saw Maclean's predecessors claiming to have weeded out UK retailers operating websites on the island solely for tax purposes.</p> <p>This week's court hearing is expected to force the UK Treasury to explain why it has allowed the tax loophole to balloon unchecked for almost a decade despite an obligation under European law for it to prevent activities designed to abuse VAT rules and avoid tax.</p> <p>Many struggling high street stores \u2013 from independent music shops to health food group Holland &amp; Barrett \u2013 believe they have suffered because of years of intransigence by Treasury officials. Music chain Fopp had been preparing to take legal action against ministers over their failure to act but the business went into administration in 2007 and was later bought by HMV.</p> <p>Given the growing public anger over the controversial deals struck between HM Revenue and Customs and major corporations such as Vodafone and Goldman Sachs, some MPs on the public accounts committee are now keen to take a closer look at why tax officials seemed so apparently unwilling to close a glaring loophole.</p> <p>Meanwhile, lawyers for Jersey will argue the proposed crackdown would result in \"severe consequences and hardship for Jersey as a whole\", hitting ferry companies, hotels, postal groups and business travel firms.</p> <p>They will also warn the high court that two of the island's biggest employers \u2014 Play.com, now owned by the Japanese firm Rakuten, and Indigo Starfish, Amazon's main partner on the island \u2014 are already carrying out \"detailed business and logistics planning\" before a likely transfer of their Jersey operations to other tax havens where they can continue to target British customers and exploit the VAT loophole.</p> <p>They claim, therefore, that \"the proposed measure will completely fail to produce the VAT revenues which Revenue &amp; Customs have projected \u2013 or any material benefit to the UK whatsoever.\"</p> <p>HMV boss Simon Fox last month admitted the group's decision to set up a warehouse in Guernsey in 2005 had been a reluctant one, but had become necessary because of moves by its rivals and the Treasury's inaction.</p> <p>He told the games industry magazine <em>MCV</em>: \"<a href=\"http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/hmv-slams-idiotic-offshore-tax-dodging/091203\" title=\"\">It can't be helpful to have your VAT rate as a determinant of where you put your warehouse</a>. It's a basic distortion to fair competition ... [The situation] is absolutely nuts.\"</p> <p>Latest Treasury estimates suggest the loophole is costing the exchequer \u00a3110m a year in lost tax, though industry experts think the true figure is likely to be far higher.</p> <p>In 2006 Jersey very publicly expelled Tesco, Amazon and other UK retailers that ministers said had been using the island as part of \"a scam\" to dodge UK sales tax.

      "bodyText": "Lawyers for the Channel Islands will travel to the high court in London this week in a last-ditch effort to block a move to clamp down on the islands' VAT-exempt e-commerce operations, which sell hundreds of millions of pounds of CD, DVDs and other goods over the internet. After years of playing down the scale of VAT-avoiding websites based on Jersey and Guernsey, the islands are now claiming the closure of this industry would be a \"catastrophe\". They are taking their case to a judicial review in the hope of blocking imminent plans to close a tax loophole that has allowed their offshore mail-order business to quietly mushroom to a substantial scale over almost a decade. Among the retailers with the most active arrangements involving the Channel Islands are four of the UK's largest online shopping sites: Amazon, Play.com, Tesco and HMV. The Channel Islands want the UK courts to stop the chancellor using this month's budget to push through a crackdown on the VAT dodge, which would outlaw it from 1 April. Goods that are purchased and imported from outside the EU for less than \u00a315 currently qualify for a VAT waiver under a European tax rule called low value consignment relief (LVCR), drafted almost 30 years ago. The relief was originally designed to expedite trade, ensuring that perishable items did not get stuck for too long in the postal system. In papers filed ahead of this week's hearing, lawyers for Jersey's economic development minister Alan Maclean says: \"If this proceeds it will result in more than a 50% increase in the overall level of unemployment in Jersey, with the consequent social and economic consequences \u2013 that is to say, a catastrophe.\" It is a dramatic shift from Jersey's past position, which for years saw Maclean's predecessors claiming to have weeded out UK retailers operating websites on the island solely for tax purposes. This week's court hearing is expected to force the UK Treasury to explain why it has allowed the tax loophole to balloon unchecked for almost a decade despite an obligation under European law for it to prevent activities designed to abuse VAT rules and avoid tax. Many struggling high street stores \u2013 from independent music shops to health food group Holland &amp; Barrett \u2013 believe they have suffered because of years of intransigence by Treasury officials. Music chain Fopp had been preparing to take legal action against ministers over their failure to act but the business went into administration in 2007 and was later bought by HMV. Given the growing public anger over the controversial deals struck between HM Revenue and Customs and major corporations such as Vodafone and Goldman Sachs, some MPs on the public accounts committee are now keen to take a closer look at why tax officials seemed so apparently unwilling to close a glaring loophole. Meanwhile, lawyers for Jersey will argue the proposed crackdown would result in \"severe consequences and hardship for Jersey as a whole\", hitting ferry companies, hotels, postal groups and business travel firms. They will also warn the high court that two of the island's biggest employers \u2014 Play.com, now owned by the Japanese firm Rakuten, and Indigo Starfish, Amazon's main partner on the island \u2014 are already carrying out \"detailed business and logistics planning\" before a likely transfer of their Jersey operations to other tax havens where they can continue to target British customers and exploit the VAT loophole. They claim, therefore, that \"the proposed measure will completely fail to produce the VAT revenues which Revenue &amp; Customs have projected \u2013 or any material benefit to the UK whatsoever.\" HMV boss Simon Fox last month admitted the group's decision to set up a warehouse in Guernsey in 2005 had been a reluctant one, but had become necessary because of moves by its rivals and the Treasury's inaction. He told the games industry magazine MCV: \"It can't be helpful to have your VAT rate as a determinant of where you put your warehouse. It's a basic distortion to fair competition ... [The situation] is absolutely nuts.\" Latest Treasury estimates suggest the loophole is costing the exchequer \u00a3110m a year in lost tax, though industry experts think the true figure is likely to be far higher. In 2006 Jersey very publicly expelled Tesco, Amazon and other UK retailers that ministers said had been using the island as part of \"a scam\" to dodge UK sales tax. In the following budget, then chancellor Gordon Brown said: \"The government welcomes the commitment made by the Jersey authorities to limit the activities of [VAT-free web] companies continuing to operate on the island.\" For years afterwards, however, the Observer and Guardian highlighted how the Treasury was ignoring the fact that VAT-free mail-order sales continued to boom on the Channel Islands. Market research data produced by Kantar in 2009 showed that 28% of DVDs bought in Britain were purchased on the web \u2013 almost all of them at VAT-free prices. Two years later that figure rose to 40%. Tesco and Amazon found ways back on to the Channel Islands via third-party agents, while many more joined the dodge by either setting up their own warehouses or using agents to do so. Among the more prominent operators were Asda, Play.com, Argos, Moonpig.com, WH Smith and HMV. Meanwhile, some of Britain's highest profile business executives became investors in agency firms specialising in helping big retailers to exploit the loophole. Among them were former Marks &amp; Spencer chief executive Sir Stuart Rose, former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy, Stagecoach founders Brian Souter and Ann Gloag and Cairn Energy founder Sir Bill Gammell. Also with a financial interest in this controversial trade is Jersey's deputy minister for economic development, James Baker, who co-founded Grafters, a recruitment agency specialising in placing temporary staff at warehouses on the island. Meanwhile, on Guernsey, commerce and employment minister Carla McNulty Bauer has also had close ties to the industry. She was formerly senior manager at VAT-dodging Healthy Direct, a health supplements mail order firm since acquired by rival Healthspan. Her colleague, education minister Robert Sillars, is chairman of Sigma Group, a firm involved in shipping printer cartridges, again some of them at VAT-free prices. Perhaps surprisingly, Scottish Enterprise, a UK government-funded investment quango, has also invested in the parent company behind Indigo Starfish. Many firms involved in VAT-free Channel Islands websites have claimed tax is not an issue for them. \"It's really a little bit of a red herring,\" said Stuart Rowe, who set up HMV's Guernsey operations before being poached to be managing director of Play.com in 2009. \"We are not really concerned because [the VAT loophole] has less of an effect on the company that it did in times gone by.\" In 2009, then Treasury minister Stephen Timms ordered Revenue officials to investigate claims made in Guardian and Observer articles.

      "bodyText": "It was a remarkable occasion. The deputy governor of the Bank of England wrote a note to the chancellor saying: \"I don't think there has been a time since the war when Treasury ministers, the Treasury staff and the Bank have worked so well together.\" This was not a reference to dealings between Treasury and Bank in recent years. These were pretty fraught following the crisis in 2007, as Alistair Darling's book makes clear, although the two institutions eventually got their act together \u2013 more or less. No, this was the great Sir George Blunden writing to chancellor Nigel Lawson, just after the 1987 general election. George, who died last weekend at the tender age of 89, had reason to know what he was talking about. He had joined the Bank in 1947, retired in 1984, and been called back as deputy governor in 1986 when the powers that were could not decide between the merits of rising stars Eddie George and David Walker, and compromised by getting Blunden back. They were great days, when governors and deputy governors held considerable sway in the City. George, who had a most distinguished career, had a mischievous streak. \"I can do anything I like now,\" he told me. \"I have been brought back from the dead.\" There was one occasion when, at an internal meeting, a junior official said: \"There seems to be a consensus.\" Blunden muttered to her, sotto voce: \"I'll soon deal with that.\" There was a wonderful undertone to Blunden's note to Lawson. The immediate period he was referring to included the famous episode when Lawson had instructed the Bank to \"shadow the D-mark\" \u2013 that is to say, to intervene in the foreign exchange markets to keep the value of the pound close to that of the German currency. Having despaired of the monetarism he had so fervently preached, my old friend Lawson decided that, if the Germans were so good at keeping inflation low, it would be a good idea to shadow their currency. The following year Margaret Thatcher was furious when she found out, and so began the slow erosion of trust between her and her chancellor. We had reported the \"pound shadowing the D-mark\" story in the Observer a long time before the prime minister discovered what was going on: indeed, Lawson claimed that she should have known. But she did not read the Observer; and, apparently, the mistress of small print did not study her chancellor's notes properly either. My lips are sealed as to the source of the story, but it was not the chancellor. These days the governor and his senior colleagues seem to be on the public stage most of the time. It was not always thus. Indeed, in more reticent times for governors I once wrote: \"If the Bank of England has a public face, it is George Blunden.\" He was tickled pink. The next time I saw him it took some time before he resumed his customary teasing, on such matters as his greater success than mine with the Azed crossword \u2013 \"the only reason for buying your paper\" he would say with a wicked grin. Blunden liked to keep people on their toes, and there are those who do not speak as highly of him as I do. At one Bank meeting he said: \"On this issue I find myself agreeing with Mike Tucker\". Everyone else murmured assent, evidently not realising that Mike Tucker was a fictional character from The Archers. Which brings us to the non-fictional Tucker who is one of Blunden's successors as deputy governor, namely Paul Tucker. (Sorry, one more Blundenism: I kept in touch with him after he retired in 1990, and, after the Brown/Balls reforms of the Bank in 1997, Sir George observed: \"I see they now need two people to do my job.\") Paul Tucker is joint deputy governor with responsibility for financial stability. He recently addressed the annual dinner of the Society of Business Economists on \"National balance sheets and macro policy: lessons from the past\". It would be only a slight exaggeration to paraphrase the gist of a long and erudite speech as \"Where we went wrong and the precautions we are now taking to avoid another disaster, although there will no doubt be one\". What particularly intrigued me was his answer to a question from Trevor Greetham of Fidelity, who suggested the need for a more expansionary fiscal stance, since macro-prudential policy was tight (all those capital-ratio requirements) and the most that monetary policy, in the form of rock-bottom interest rates and quantitative easing, seemed to be doing was producing zero growth. Tucker revealed that during a weekend shortly before the 2010 election, when the Greek crisis arose, he told governor King: \"You have got to urge the government, whoever wins, to take the UK out of the line of targets.\" Whether Sir Mervyn needed urging is an open question, but there seems little doubt, from this and various public statements made by the governor over the past 20 months, that the Bank and Treasury are in this deflationary strategy together. We are all suffering for this, and the pre-budget debate about minor changes in tax rates does not begin to address the accumulated problems of the British economy. I shall return to this subject after the budget, from which, it has to be said, I am not expecting the kind of growth strategy for which Vince Cable has called. But no doubt the deputy governor will be writing to the chancellor on the subject of how well they are working together.",
