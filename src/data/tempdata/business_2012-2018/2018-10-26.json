      "bodyText": "MPs and peers who exploit parliamentary privilege to breach court injunctions are undermining the rule of law, senior lawyers have claimed. Lord Peter Hain\u2019s decision to name Sir Philip Green as the businessman protected by an injunction split legal opinion and reignited a constitutional dispute between the judiciary and parliament that had been dormant since the row over super-injunctions in 2011. The case sets the principle of absolute freedom of speech enjoyed by parliamentarians \u2013 which enables the media to report what is said in the Commons or Lords \u2013 against the slower-moving, legal priorities of the courts. Hugh Tomlinson QC, an expert in media and privacy law, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the function of the courts to decide cases after hearing evidence and arguments. It\u2019s not the function of parliamentarians to decide cases or decide that the judiciary has got it wrong. \u201cIf that happens, it\u2019s a fundamental threat to the rule of law. They have no idea of what the focus of the cases are. They haven\u2019t seen the evidence. This could be an appalling case of bad behaviour or absolutely proper and above the board. Lord Hain has no idea.\u201d Tomlinson suggested that a solution in future might involve the speaker of the Commons or Lords saying that any such comments should be \u201cremoved from the parliamentary record\u201d, depriving the media of the legal protection in reporting it. On Friday, it emerged that Lord Hain is a paid adviser to Gordon Dadds LLP, the law firm that represented the Daily Telegraph in the Philip Green injunction case. The company\u2019s website carries a statement that describes him as being its \u201cglobal and government adviser\u201d. In a statement on Friday, Hain said: \u201cI took the decision to name Sir Philip Green in my personal capacity as an independent member of the House of Lords. I categorically state that I was completely unaware Gordon Dadds were advising the Telegraph regarding this case. \u201cGordon Dadds \u2026 played absolutely no part whatsoever in either the sourcing of my information or my independent decision to name Sir Philip. They were completely unaware of my intentions until after I spoke in the House of Lords.\u201d Gordon Dadds also denied it had provided any information to Hain. In a statement it said: \u201cPeter Hain is a self-employed consultant who provides occasional advice to the firm relating principally to African affairs. Any suggestion that Gordon Dadds LLP has in any way acted improperly is entirely false. \u201cPeter Hain did not obtain any information from Gordon Dadds regarding this case. He has no involvement in the advice that we provide to the Telegraph newspaper, and he had no knowledge of any sensitive information regarding this case.\u201d Late on Friday night it was reported that Green planned to lodge a formal complaint about Hain. The BBC\u2019s business editor Simon Jack said Green had told him he intended to complain to the Lords authorities that Hain had failed to disclose his financial relationship with Gordon Dodds. According to paragraph 10(b) of the House of Lords code of conduct, members must \u201cdeclare when speaking in the House, or communicating with ministers or public servants, any interest which is a relevant interest in the context of the debate or the matter under discussion\u201d. Enforcement of the code is overseen by the House of Lords commissioner for standards, Lucy Scott-Moncrieff. No formal complaint about Hain\u2019s comments had been made by the end of the session on Friday. The former attorney general, Dominic Grieve QC, had earlier also attacked Hain\u2019s decision to name Green. \u201cIt was an entirely arrogant decision that had absolutely no regard for judicial process or the rule of law,\u201d he told the BBC, pointing out that the injunction against the Telegraph was only an interim one. Grieve added: \u201cParliamentary privilege is very important, but like any power which is extremely important, it is open to abuse. I can\u2019t see \u2013 looking at this particular matter \u2013 that Peter Hain can argue that he hasn\u2019t abused it.\u201d But Geoffrey Robertson QC, an expert in media and human rights law, said: \u201cParliamentary privilege is an historic aspect of Britain\u2019s unwritten constitution. It was used to expose Kim Philby when the establishment was trying to cover up his treason [in the 1960s]. As a privilege, Peter Hain was entitled to use it, and he did so responsibly. \u201cVarious leading businessmen were being accused on Twitter and it was important for their sake to end speculation. It was in the public interest to reveal a little of the truth. This is really about free speech.\u201d Robertson said that non-disclosure agreements meant that complainants could be silenced by judges brought up to prefer property rights over human rights. \u201cBreach of confidence injunctions stop the truth from being told. Outside the national security context, injunctions should not be granted against the media. We should give free speech the priority it deserves and refrain from permanently gagging anyone,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap Global stock markets are on track for their worst month in five years ,after another day of losses. In London, the FTSE 100 has lost nearly 1% to close at its weakest level since March. At one point it hit a 22-month low. The US stock markets is also in the red today. Technology stocks are leading the sell-off, after Amazon and Alphabet underwhelmed Wall Street with their results last night. Investors have not taken much cheer from the latest US GDP report, which showed a slightly faster acceleration in growth than expected. Consumer spending and government spending both boosted growth, but trade was a drag. Asia-Pacific markets also ended the week with another bout of volatility, and fears that contagion was spreading through the markets. Here\u2019s our latest news story on the markets, after a turbulent week: Shares in New York are also climbing back from their earlier lows. The Dow is now down just 140 points, or 0.6%, as a degree of calm returns to Wall Street. Britain\u2019s FTSE 250, an index of smaller companies, also lost almost 1% today: As European traders count their losses and head to the pub, their counterparts on Wall Street have just endured a rough morning Here\u2019s the latest damage: Dow Jones industrial average: down 279 points or 1.1% at 24,715 S&amp;P 500: down 43 points or 1.6% at 2,661 Nasdaq: down 153 points or 2.2% at 6,862 Neil Wilson of Markets.com says the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) are doing the damage. He writes: Bloody FAANGs means Halloween comes early in nightmare month for equities. \u201cNo respite for equity markets today as the weight of the FAANGs dragged on the wider market and raises a real risk that this selloff is about to turn into a full bear market. The S&amp;P 500 has now dipped into correction territory in little over a month \u2013 a steep selloff. Amazon and Alphabet earnings disappointed with less upbeat outlooks casting a cloud over tech stocks in particular. Bear in mind that it\u2019s still the only real bright spot out there YTD and now it looks as though it\u2019s starting to rollover. If FAANGs are rolling over the weaker sector stocks are very vulnerable \u2013 Snap off 15% today after reporting another quarter of declining users and offered a pessimistic outlook. Snap\u2019s investment thesis was always shaky and the truth is it was never going to deliver. Quality like Microsoft and Intel are holding relatively firm \u2013 they\u2019ve not seen sky high valuations as some of the FAANGs so are seen a bit safer, while both have delivered on earnings. Just in: Britain\u2019s stock market has ended the day solidly in the red, at the end of a volatile week. However, the losses aren\u2019t quite as bad as earlier in the day, when stocks were languishing at a 22-month low. The FTSE 100 closed 64 points lower, or -0.92%, at 6,939 points. Things looked worse an hour ago, before shares rallied into the closing auction in London. Evraz was the biggest faller, down 6.3%, followed by online supermarket chain Ocada (-5%) and BT (-4.5%). There are losses in Europe: Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.94% French CAC: -1.3% Italian FTSE MIB: -0.7% Fiona Cincotta of City Index says: The large-scale volatility that we have seen across the week was certainly not packing away for the weekend early. The bloodbath continued with markets across the globe slamming lower as concerns over US corporate results overshadowed a robust US GDP figure. As shares slide, investors are piling into the safety of government bonds. Debt issued by Germany and America is always attractive on these occasions. So as prices leap, bond yields (the interest on the bond) are dropping. Newsflash: The FTSE 100 just hit its lowest level since December 2016. It fell 152 points, or over 2%, to 6851, as markets end the week on a low. Technology stocks had been a stellar performer earlier this year. But now they\u2019re sliding, and dragging the wider markets down, according to David Madden of CMC Markets: The S&amp;P 500 has fallen into correction territory as the decline in stocks intensifies. Amazon and Alphabet shares are in the red after both companies missed on revenue forecasts last night, and Amazon\u2019s guidance was also below the consensus estimate. US tech stocks set a series of record-highs throughout the summer, and they were the first to fall in the recent market rout. There is a sense that the tech sector is setting the pace for the rest of the world. The sell-off is gathering pace, again. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers a broader spread of the US economy than the Dow, is down 2.2%. That puts the S&amp;P 500 into correction territory, more than 10% off its peak in September. The good news for City investors is that this week of pain is almost over. The bad news is that the FTSE 100 is wallowing close its lowest level since December 2016. The blue-chip Footsie index is down 117 points, or almost 1.7%, at 6887. Steel and mining company Evraz is the biggest faller, down 7.6% after mixed production numbers yesterday. WPP has shed another 4.6%, after Thursday\u2019s rout following a profits warning. Several economists are predicting that the US economy will slow in the quarters ahead, after six months of solid growth. Capital Economics believes tighter monetary policy is already having an impact: At 3.5% annualised, GDP growth remained unusually strong in the third quarter, thanks partly to this year\u2019s fiscal stimulus, but there are signs that higher interest rates are beginning to have a bigger restraining effect. Once the boost from fiscal stimulus fades next year, we expect economic growth to slow below its potential rate, forcing the Fed to the side-lines by mid-2019. Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist of CEBR, believes the trade war with China will also hurt growth. Q3 growth surprised on the upside, showing that the US economy continues to perform with considerable momentum in the second half of the year. However, house-made problems including the deteriorating global trading conditions and the fast pace of monetary tightening spell trouble for the coming quarters.\u201d Ouch! The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 400 points, or 1.7%, as the market turmoil continues. Another tech firm, Cisco, is the biggest faller on the Dow (down 2.1%), followed by Home Depot (-1.9%) and American Express (-1.7%). Technology stocks are sliding in New York, particularly those which have disappointed Wall Street. Hard drive maker Western Digital has tumbled by 17%, after reporting a 3% drop in revenues for the last quarter. Profits shrank by 24%. Amazon has slumped by 7.5% after giving disappointing guidance for the holiday period last night. Google parent company Alphabet has shed 3%. This is all weighing on the Nasdaq, of course, which is down over 2%. The bell has rung and stronger-than-expected US growth in Q3 has failed to cheer investors. Opening scores: Dow Jones: -242 points or -1% at 24,742 S&amp;P 500: -39 points or -1.5% at 2,666 Nasdaq: -186 points or -2.5% at 7,132 Three minutes until the opening bell on Wall Street... Balraj Sroya, trader at currency firm Foenix Partners, says the US growth figures are key to both Trump and the Federal Reserve: Trump\u2019s mantra of \u2018Making America Great Again\u2019 is echoing across the US economy as third quarter GDP growth outpaced market consensus with a print of 3.5%. Consumer spending and businesses increasing their inventories aided the strongest back to back quarters for growth in over two years. Today\u2019s print was crucial for Trump and the GOP ahead of the Midterm elections as GDP seems to be aligning with the President\u2019s target for 2018, however it could spark the Fed to consider a more aggressive monetary policy. The detail behind the headline GDP growth figure, published by the US Commerce Department, shows that consumer spending boosted the economy in the third quarter, but net trade was a drag as exports fell but imports rose. The Department said: The increase in real GDP in the third quarter reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures, private inventory investment, state and local government spending, federal government spending, and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by negative contributions from exports and residential fixed investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. The deceleration in real GDP growth in the third quarter reflected a downturn in exports and a deceleration in nonresidential fixed investment. Imports increased in the third quarter after decreasing in the second. These movements were partly offset by an upturn in private inventory investment. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said Donald Trump is likely to jump on the US growth figures: We can expect President Trump to wax lyrical about these results in the run up to the congressional midterm elections, adding evidence to his promise on expanding the economy. However, growth has already moderated and will continue to do so in 2019 as the tax cut boost dissipates and inflation tightens its grip as a result of Trump\u2019s tit for tat with China. (No Trump tweet about Q3 as yet...) Pre-trading on Wall Street has picked up after the news that US growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter, to 3.5%. US futures are still down before the opening bell, but less so: Dow Jones: -177 points or -0.7% S&amp;P 500: -24 points or -0.9% Nasdaq: -124 points or -1.8% Breaking: The US economy grew by 3.5% in the third quarter, faster than the 3.3% predicted by economists. It was a slowdown compared with the second quarter, when the economy grew by 4.2% on an annual basis. Economists at Investec have taken a step back from this week\u2019s market mayhem to look at prospects in the months ahead for the global economy. In a month full of uncertainties, a \u2018glass half full\u2019 approach might be to say that there has been some respite in global trade tensions. However the pause looks to be because the Chinese and US authorities are eyeing more constructive talks after the US mid-terms. Even with this respite, risk assets are currently under pressure amid continuing concerns that the Fed may embark on a more aggressive tightening path, concerns over earnings and equity valuations and as other global political concerns have arisen. Furthermore some signs have emerged that suggest recent protectionist actions have spilt over into confidence and growth. But as yet we do not judge risks related to the above to be substantial enough to shift our world GDP forecasts, particularly given supportive fiscal policy in the US and China. We continue to look for 3.8% world growth this year and 3.7% next. Risks though lie to the downside for 2019. The pound is down 0.3% against the dollar at a two-month low of $1.2784. It\u2019s partly a story of a stronger dollar, which is up against a basket of currencies ahead of the US GDP number at 1.30pm UK time. Another day, another statement from Patisserie Valerie, the troubled cafe and bakery chain which earlier this month discovered a black hole in its accounts and a \u00a31m unpaid tax bill that threatened the firm\u2019s collapse. The latest news is that Chris Marsh, the firm\u2019s finance director who was arrested on suspicion of fraud and subsequently bailed, has resigned. Pat Val\u2019s parent company, Patisserie Holdings, issued a brief statement: Patisserie Holdings plc announces that following the suspension of Chris Marsh on 9 October 2018, the company has now accepted his resignation as the company\u2019s finance director with immediate effect, while reserving its position in respect of any potential claims it may have against him. The latest announcement isn\u2019t quite surprising as the company\u2019s other ones over the past month. Thursdays rebound on Wall Street - with the Dow Jones surging 401 points - is nowhere to be seen today, with global markets on course for their longest losing streak in more than five years. European markets are sharply lower and US futures suggest the Dow could lose another 300-or-so points when the bell goes on Wall Street. Here\u2019s a look at US futures: Dow Jones: -271 points or -1.1% S&amp;P 500: -38 points or -1.4% Nasdaq: -174 points or -2.5% The MSCI all-country index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was earlier down 0.3% and on track for a fifth week of losses - the longest losing streak since May 2013. Royal Bank of Scotland is weighing on the FTSE 100 this morning, with shares down nearly 5%. The bailed-out bank published third-quarter results this morning, and the detail has underwhelmed investors. Attributable profit - the figure which determines the dividend - was up 14% in the three months to the end of September, at \u00a3448m, but it was below expectations of \u00a3507m. Operating costs also increased as the bank set aside another \u00a3200m for payment protection insurance claims. In better news, pre-tax profit rose 10% in the third quarter, to \u00a3961m. But that has not been enough for traders, and RBS is among the top FTSE fallers: Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says that hopes appear to have been dashed for a positive end to the week for the FTSE . Any suggestion UK stocks might end the week on a more positive note has been swatted aside after the third quarter sales performance of Amazon and Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet disappointed after the market close in the US. Given the technology sector helped lead US indices to fresh highs in 2018 and is so dominant, its performance in the current earning season was always likely to be pivotal to investor sentiment. As if traders didn\u2019t have enough to contend with, later today we\u2019ll get US GDP data for the third quarter. Figures are expected to show the world\u2019s largest economy grew by 3.3% in the third quarter, on an annual basis. It would be a slowdown from 4.2% in the second quarter. The figures will be published at 1.30pm, UK time. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spread Ex, says the number could weigh on investor moods: Given that the slightest thing sets the markets off at the moment, it is going to be interesting to see how they deal with this afternoon\u2019s first look at the US third quarter GDP figure. Analysts are expecting a slowdown from 4.2% in Q2 to 3.3% in Q3, a decline that may only cause further problems at the end of a tiring and tricky week. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the markets in Europe, where losses are accelerating this morning: As well as the disappointing results (on some measures) from Amazon and Alphabet, investors are also concerned by a number of other risks. To name a few - the US/China trade war, rising US interest rates, instability in emerging markets, and Brexit. Here is our story on how the market volatility has gripped Asian and Australian markets overnight: Opening bells have rung across Europe and the mood is gloomy: FTSE 100: -0.8% Germany\u2019s DAX: -1.1% France\u2019s CAC: -1% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.6% Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.6% David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, explains why Amazon and Alphabet disappointed investors: We heard from tech giants Amazon and Alphabet after the closing bell last night. Amazon topped the earnings per share forecast, but missed on revenue and the guidance. Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, exceeded estimates on EPS, but undershot the revenue forecast. Both stocks dropped heavily in the post-market session, and in turn sparked selling across major US indices. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re almost at the end of what has been a hugely volatile week for global stock markets. Wall Street bounced back on Thursday, with the Dow Jones surging 401 points, a gain of 1.6%, to close at 24,984. It followed sharp falls on Wednesday, and the turnaround in sentiment was largely down to technology stocks - after positive Twitter and Microsoft results - industrials companies and banks. But sentiment soured when US tech giants Amazon and Alphabet reported disappointing revenues after the closing bell on Wall Street. It was enough to send US futures lower, which in turn triggered a sell-off in Asia where shares hit 20-month lows. Markets across Europe are expected to open sharply lower this morning as the gloomy sentiment spreads across the Atlantic: We will be following the markets and all the latest business news as this volatile week for global markets draws to a close.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green is now fighting fires on all fronts with the \u201c#MeToo\u201d scandal blowing up at a time when the billionaire is battling to shore up his crumbling high street empire. Profits at Topshop\u2019s owner, Arcadia, have fallen sharply in recent years as the fashion group, which also owns the struggling Evans and Wallis brands, is hit hard by the growth of online shopping. New figures seen by the Guardian show Arcadia\u2019s sales were down 9% in a flat market over the 12 weeks to 26 August, according to the analysis firm Kantar Worldpanel. The group\u2019s market share has shrunk to 3.4% \u2013 which means it is just over half the size of Primark \u2013 compared with 3.7% a year ago and 4.1% in 2015. One former Arcadia staffer suggested that the picture at Topshop had not improved, with sales still thought to be \u201ctanking\u201d amid tough high street conditions: \u201cThe other brands never made any money. Topshop and Topman always kept the whole business afloat. If Topshop is not working, they have got a huge problem.\u201d Last year, Green drafted in the Burberry executive Paul Price to run Topshop, but the ex-employee suggested he was under considerable pressure: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how good he is, it\u2019s too late. Nothing has been invested in any of the brands to the extent they can stand against the onslaught of online and the fact that fashion is not a pastime for young people any more.\u201d The problems mark a dramatic decline in fortunes since 2005, when the Greens famously paid themselves \u00a31.2bn from Arcadia, which still holds the record as the biggest payout in British corporate history. There was no dividend last year, let alone one with so many zeros, after a slump that saw the group\u2019s turnover decline by \u00a3113m to \u00a31.9bn. Sales at all of Arcadia\u2019s main brands fell that year, with the steepest declines seen at Wallis, the 30-something womenswear brand, where sales fell 11.5%, and plus-sized chain Evans, down 11.2% in the year to 26 August 2017. The financial snapshot, taken from the accounts of subsidiary companies filed at Companies House by GlobalData, is not much better at smart menswear brand Burton and former teen favourite Miss Selfridge, which both saw sales declines of nearly 8%. Even at Topshop and Topman, the figures made grim reading, with combined sales down nearly 6% as new brands such as Boohoo and Missguided picked off millennial shoppers. The sale and subsequent collapse of BHS means Arcadia now accounts for the bulk of Green\u2019s retail interests, although he also owns a stake in the publicly quoted cut price online retailer MySale. The BHS scandal, as well as the deteriorating financial performance of Arcadia, has taken a toll on the fortune controlled by Green\u2019s Monaco-based wife, Tina. The couple, who are also thought to have a property portfolio that includes the Topshop flagship store in London\u2019s West End, saw their wealth marked down \u00a3787m to \u00a32bn in this year\u2019s Sunday Times Rich List. One analyst who declined to be named said Arcadia was suffering in what was a tough market for all fashion brands: \u201cThe only growth in the last two or three years has been sportswear,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung people are not turning out to be particularly big buyers of clothing. All they want is skinny jeans and sneakers.\u201d The analyst said that the whole market had been forced to cut prices as it faced heavy competition from Primark and Zara and that there was a small pack of pricier brands, including Topshop, where \u201cprices are not particularly good value\u201d. The analyst added: \u201cTeenagers will pay \u00a3100 or more for the latest cool gear like a trainer, but it has got to be a brand that means something. I\u2019m not sure that Topshop means a lot to the average 18-year-old.\u201d With Green\u2019s reputation shredded by the fallout from the 2016 collapse of BHS, it was reported this year that Green was in talks to sell Arcadia to the Chinese firm Shandong Ruyi \u2013 although the tycoon said the reports were totally false. Selling the company is fraught with difficulties, particularly given the size of Arcadia\u2019s pension fund, which had a deficit of \u00a3993m in March last year \u2013 a figure based on the likely cost of winding up the scheme and securing benefits with an insurer. The ownership of Topshop also adds complexity. After Green launched an audacious bid to crack America with the chain in 2009, he sold a 25% stake in Topshop and Topman to American private equity firm Leonard Green &amp; Partners for \u00a3350m in a deal that valued the two companies at \u00a32bn. By 2017, Leonard Green was said to have written down the value of its shareholding on its books. Topshop is also looking for another retailer to take over its expensive store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, which opened in 2014, according to US press reports. Retail insiders point to the ongoing high street crisis and the spectre of Brexit, which could hit the sector\u2019s profitability next year. Potential buyers have also been put off by the BHS disaster, knowing that any deal would be subject to close scrutiny by the media and politicians. \u201cWould you buy a business from Philip Green?\u201d asks one senior retail executive. \u201cCould they do enough due diligence to satisfy themselves?\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Revealed: Philip Green paid seven-figure sums to silence abuse claims", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Several employees of Sir Philip Green who alleged the tycoon had sexually harassed or bullied them were given enormous seven-figure secret payouts to settle their claims, the Guardian has learned. The huge settlements were part of a widespread culture of silence at Green\u2019s Arcadia Group, an insider said, where the billionaire owner allegedly harassed female staff but few felt able to speak up, and where senior managers frequently ignored his behaviour. The Guardian understands there are at least seven cases in which former staff members have received substantial payouts to settle complaints of sexual harassment, bullying or racist abuse against Green. In several of those cases, the sums involved reached seven figures. The settlements, agreed by both sides, stopped them speaking out over their claims. It is not known whether these cases were among the five that were subject to a press injunction revealed earlier this week. One incident of alleged harassment that led to a substantial payout was dismissed by a senior manager because \u201che didn\u2019t really seem to think that there was anything wrong\u201d, the insider told the Guardian. \u201cI don\u2019t think he thought Philip was doing anything wrong, I think he just saw it as, that\u2019s how it is.\u201d In that instance and others where staff raised grievances, \u201cit was just a case of, to make sure this doesn\u2019t go to court and to make sure nobody finds out, how many zeros do you want on the end of this cheque?\u201d The source alleged Green\u2019s behaviour included: walking into meetings and giving women present a lingering hug asking women in meetings if they were \u201cnaughty girls\u201d, and if they \u201cneeded their bottoms slapped\u201d creeping up behind women in corridors to make them jump, before caressing their shoulders to \u201creassure\u201d them calling women \u201csweetheart\u201d, \u201cdarling\u201d or \u201clove\u201d, rather than by their names telling women they were overweight and should go on a diet flying into expletive-ridden rages abusing male and female staff in front of colleagues Senior executives at the company were aware of Green\u2019s behaviour but had \u201cno appetite\u201d to challenge him, according to the source. When they raised the matter with colleagues \u201cit would be [a case of] \u2018Well, he\u2019s old school, you can\u2019t change that generation\u2019. It was always played down.\u201d Green was named on Thursday in parliament as the businessman at the centre of a legal battle with the Telegraph newspaper, which has been blocked from publishing accusations against him of bullying and sexual and racial harassment of former employees, which it has described as a \u201cBritish #MeToo scandal\u201d. The court of appeal had granted an interim injunction stopping the newspaper from publishing details of the alleged harassment because the complainants had signed non-disclosure agreements. This ruling overturned an earlier finding by the high court that disclosure was in the public interest. On Thursday night, Green issued a statement saying: \u201cTo the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations. \u201cArcadia and I take accusations and grievances from employees very seriously and in the event that one is raised, it is thoroughly investigated.\u201d The source described a culture inside Arcadia\u2019s Colegrave House headquarters in central London in which Green was \u201cgenerally feared\u201d. \u201cOne thing that he said and did a lot, was walk into meeting rooms unannounced, because that is his vibe, and he would ask the women in the room, were they behaving, were they being naughty girls, and did they need their bottom slapped. That is almost his standard way of introducing himself into a room.\u201d The women present would react with \u201cnervous laughter\u201d, but rarely complained. Green was also \u201cvery physical\u201d with women, according to the source. \u201cThere were lots of hugs with women, particularly with senior women. I would describe them as overly long, lingering hugs. \u201cHe would walk into meeting rooms that he didn\u2019t need to be in, he would just walk in, say hi to people and hug all the women in the room. His hands weren\u2019t anywhere inappropriate, just around their backs, but they would be quite long, not just a quick, hey how are you hug.\u201d The men in the room would be greeted with a handshake. The insider also witnessed several occasions when Green would \u201ccreep up behind women who were walking along the corridor in the office and shout \u2018Boo!\u2019 or something to make them jump, and then to \u2018calm them down\u2019 put his hands on their shoulders and rub them in a weird kind of massage\u201d. There was also \u201ca general unofficial rule between women that you wouldn\u2019t get into a lift with him\u201d, the insider said. One woman who asked Green to use her name in a meeting rather than \u201csweetheart\u201d and \u201cdarling\u201d was told to \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d. The source said they had witnessed an incident in which Green made a comment about a woman\u2019s weight and said she \u201cmust be a lesbian because no man would marry her\u201d, and another in which he asked an Asian woman if she had been \u201ceating too many samosas\u201d. \u201cHe would make a lot of comments about women being overweight,\u201d the insider said. \u201cA lot of them weren\u2019t overweight but they just didn\u2019t fit his standard.\u201d Green and his wife, Tina, who controls the family empire, are worth an estimated \u00a32bn, much of it accrued after his purchase of BHS in 2000 and the Arcadia Group, which owns Topshop, Topman and Burton, two years later. The businessman was knighted in 2006 by Tony Blair for \u201cservices to retail\u201d and in 2010 David Cameron appointed him as an adviser to review public sector procurement. However, his reputation plummeted in 2015 after he sold BHS, from which he had taken hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends, for \u00a31 to a former bankrupt businessman. The company later collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of more than \u00a3500m. Following high-profile calls that he be stripped of his knighthood, Green agreed to pay \u00a3363m into the pension scheme.

Wesley Taylor, Burton\u2019s brand director, alleged Green had used racially abusive language against him on several occasions, and threatened to take him to an employment tribunal. The matter was settled out of court. Green denied making racist remarks. The biography also said the businessman often made female staff cry, and \u201cdelighted in undermining\u201d senior staff.",

      "body": "<p>Several employees of Sir Philip Green who alleged the tycoon had sexually harassed or bullied them were given enormous seven-figure secret payouts to settle their claims, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The huge settlements were part of a widespread culture of silence at Green\u2019s Arcadia Group, an insider said, where the billionaire owner allegedly harassed female staff but few felt able to speak up, and where senior managers frequently ignored his behaviour.</p> <p>The Guardian understands there are at least seven cases in which former staff members have received substantial payouts to settle complaints of sexual harassment, bullying or racist abuse against Green. In several of those cases, the sums involved reached seven figures.</p> <p>The settlements, agreed by both sides, stopped them speaking out over their claims. It is not known whether these cases were among the five that were subject to a press injunction revealed earlier this week.</p> <p>One incident of alleged harassment that led to a substantial payout was dismissed by a senior manager because \u201che didn\u2019t really seem to think that there was anything wrong\u201d, the insider told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he thought Philip was doing anything wrong, I think he just saw it as, that\u2019s how it is.\u201d</p> <p>In that instance and others where staff raised grievances, \u201cit was just a case of, to make sure this doesn\u2019t go to court and to make sure nobody finds out, how many zeros do you want on the end of this cheque?\u201d</p> <p>The source alleged Green\u2019s behaviour included:</p> <ul> <li><p>walking into meetings and giving women present a lingering hug</p></li> <li><p>asking women in meetings if they were \u201cnaughty girls\u201d, and if they \u201cneeded their bottoms slapped\u201d</p></li> <li><p>creeping up behind women in corridors to make them jump, before caressing their shoulders to \u201creassure\u201d them</p></li> <li><p>calling women \u201csweetheart\u201d, \u201cdarling\u201d or \u201clove\u201d, rather than by their names</p></li> <li><p>telling women they were overweight and should go on a diet</p></li> <li><p>flying into expletive-ridden rages abusing male and female staff in front of colleagues</p></li> </ul> <p>Senior executives at the company were aware of Green\u2019s behaviour but had \u201cno appetite\u201d to challenge him, according to the source. When they raised the matter with colleagues \u201cit would be [a case of] \u2018Well, he\u2019s old school, you can\u2019t change that generation\u2019. It was always played down.\u201d</p> <p>Green was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/25/sir-philip-green-named-as-man-at-centre-of-uk-metoo-scandal\">named on Thursday in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/25/sir-philip-green-named-as-man-at-centre-of-uk-metoo-scandal\">parliament</a> as the businessman at the centre of a legal battle with the Telegraph newspaper, which has been blocked from publishing accusations against him of bullying and sexual and racial harassment of former employees, which it has described as a \u201cBritish #MeToo scandal\u201d.</p> <p>The court of appeal had granted an interim injunction stopping the newspaper from publishing details of the alleged harassment because the complainants had signed non-disclosure agreements. This ruling overturned an earlier finding by the high court that disclosure was in the public interest.</p> <p>On Thursday night, Green issued a statement saying: \u201cTo the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>Arcadia and I take accusations and grievances from employees very seriously and in the event that one is raised, it is thoroughly investigated.\u201d</p> <p>The source described a culture inside Arcadia\u2019s Colegrave House headquarters in central London in which Green was \u201cgenerally feared\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing that he said and did a lot, was walk into meeting rooms unannounced, because that is his vibe, and he would ask the women in the room, were they behaving, were they being naughty girls, and did they need their bottom slapped. That is almost his standard way of introducing himself into a room.\u201d</p> <p>The women present would react with \u201cnervous laughter\u201d, but rarely complained.</p> <p>Green was also \u201cvery physical\u201d with women, according to the source. \u201cThere were lots of hugs with women, particularly with senior women. I would describe them as overly long, lingering hugs.</p> <p>\u201cHe would walk into meeting rooms that he didn\u2019t need to be in, he would just walk in, say hi to people and hug all the women in the room. His hands weren\u2019t anywhere inappropriate, just around their backs, but they would be quite long, not just a quick, hey how are you hug.\u201d The men in the room would be greeted with a handshake.</p> <p>The insider also witnessed several occasions when Green would \u201ccreep up behind women who were walking along the corridor in the office and shout \u2018Boo!\u2019 or something to make them jump, and then to \u2018calm them down\u2019 put his hands on their shoulders and rub them in a weird kind of massage\u201d.</p> <p>There was also \u201ca general unofficial rule between women that you wouldn\u2019t get into a lift with him\u201d, the insider said.</p> <p>One woman who asked Green to use her name in a meeting rather than \u201csweetheart\u201d and \u201cdarling\u201d was told to \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d. The source said they had witnessed an incident in which Green made a comment about a woman\u2019s weight and said she \u201cmust be a lesbian because no man would marry her\u201d, and another in which he asked an Asian woman if she had been \u201ceating too many samosas\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe would make a lot of comments about women being overweight,\u201d the insider said. \u201cA lot of them weren\u2019t overweight but they just didn\u2019t fit his standard.\u201d</p> <p>Green and his wife, Tina, who controls the family empire, are worth an estimated \u00a32bn, much of it accrued after his purchase of BHS in 2000 and the Arcadia Group, which owns Topshop, Topman and Burton, two years later.</p> <p>The businessman was knighted in 2006 by Tony Blair for \u201cservices to retail\u201d and in 2010 David Cameron appointed him as an adviser to review public sector procurement. However, his reputation plummeted in 2015 after he sold BHS, from which he had taken hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends, for \u00a31 to a former bankrupt businessman. The company later collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of more than \u00a3500m.</p> <p>Following high-profile calls that he be stripped of his knighthood, Green agreed to pay \u00a3363m into the pension scheme.</p> <p>The insider said: \u201cThe culture in Arcadia is very much, it is all about Philip. He will go into a meeting room, or sit down with people and ask what they are doing, they will try to explain and he interrupts, calls people stupid, he says they are a waste of time, what they are doing is pointless.

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) brought charges against the bank over the 2008 deal, which saved Barclays from having to request a UK government bailout like its rivals Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds. Barclays and four of its former executives, who are still facing prosecution, were charged in June 2017 with conspiracy to commit fraud and the provision of unlawful financial assistance. The latter allegation related to a $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) loan from Barclays to Qatar, which the UK\u2019s anti-fraud agency said was then used to invest in the bank. The charges were the first in Britain to be brought against a bank and its former executives for their actions during the financial crisis. Southwark crown court in London dismissed the charges earlier this year and on Friday, the high court ruled against the SFO\u2019s attempt to have them reinstated. The decision means Barclays will avoid the prospect of a highly visible jury trial over its actions. But charges remain open against former chief executive John Varley, Roger Jenkins, who ran the investment banking arm, Thomas Kalaris, former head of Barclays\u2019 wealth division, and former European head of financial institutions Richard Boath. All four are expected to face trial in January. Barclays secured a \u00a36.1bn capital injection from Qatar in 2008 as the banking crisis spread around the world. This obviated the need for a bailout from the UK government. In a statement to the stock market, Barclays said a review by the Financial Conduct Authority had been put on hold during the SFO\u2019s investigation. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and department of justice were also investigating the same deals, Barclays said. The bank added that other authorities had also been kept informed of developments. Barclays is also facing a civil claim, which it is defending, from financier Amanda Staveley\u2019s PCP Capital Partners, over a capital injection she helped arrange from Abu Dhabi.",

      "bodyText": "Tenants are to be given more powers to fight rogue landlords renting out properties \u201cunfit for human habitation\u201d, following a key vote by MPs. The move came in a week when a Guardian and ITV News investigation discovered how convicted landlords can continue to collect rents \u2013 often funded by taxpayers via housing benefit \u2013 even when they have been prosecuted for housing offences and failed to pass the \u201cfit and proper\u201d person tests required by housing legislation. The investigation also revealed that local authorities had failed to make a single entry on central government\u2019s new rogue landlord database in the six months since its launch, while more than one in seven councils in England and Wales had failed to prosecute a single bad landlord over the past three years, despite some having high numbers of homes classed as \u201cnon-decent\u201d. From next year renters in England will be able to force landlords to remedy problems or hazards that make their home \u201cunfit\u201d \u2013 and will also be able to seek compensation if work is not done \u2013 after cross-party support ensured that a private member\u2019s bill introduced by the Labour backbencher Karen Buck passes to the House of Lords. The bill will allow tenants to bypass council enforcement teams, some of which have poor records of taking action against rogue landlords. It will also give council tenants an avenue for redress, as local authorities cannot bring cases against themselves. Currently, a landlord commits an offence when they fail to comply with a local authority enforcement notice, so they cannot be held responsible for poor conditions unless they have been told to carry out repairs by a council. Buck said in the chamber: \u201cLiving in a cold, damp or unsafe home is hell. It damages people\u2019s physical and mental wellbeing. It erodes the income of the poorest households. It impacts on children\u2019s education. The most vulnerable tenants are most at risk of being trapped in substandard accommodation. \u201cThere is a huge degree of variability in inspection, notices and enforcement rates by councils. About half of all councils have served none or only one Housing Act notice in the last year. One London council, Newham, which has an active enforcement policy, amounted to half of all notices served nationally and 70% of those in London \u2026 What this means is that there is a complete postcode lottery on the prospects of councils taking steps \u2013 and with the real prospect being that the council won\u2019t do so.\u201d Buck\u2019s previous freedom of information requests suggest that councils only bring enforcement action in cases relating to just 1% of the most serious hazards found in rented homes. Neil O\u2019Brien, Conservative MP for Harborough, added: \u201cThis week we have seen on the front page of the Guardian two days in a row incredible examples of problems with repeat slum landlords. This is clearly a big problem and I know that ministers are thinking about it \u2026 Clearly [this bill] will not be the end of the story. And clearly we need to think about enforcement and how we can enable enforcement to pay for itself by fining and taking the property of people who are repeated slum landlords\u201d. The government is supporting the bill and announced a review of the safety standards expected of rental housing Heather Wheeler, minister for housing and homelessness: said: \u201c[Buck\u2019s] bill is an important part of our work to raise awareness of this vital issue \u2013 that of standards in rented properties.\u201d It is expected to become law in the early part of 2019 and will apply to new tenancy agreements as well as existing social tenancies after a 12-month period.",

      "bodyText": "Fancy becoming the lord of your own medieval manor? The country\u2019s last remaining feudal village, complete with 17 working farms, 10 cottages, a pub and the title lord of the manor of Laxton, is up for sale for \u00a37m. The Nottinghamshire village, which dates back to 1066 and still operates a an \u201copen field\u201d strip farming system, has been put up for sale in one of the most unusual estate agent listings ever posted. A 20-page brochure sent to potential buyers this week describes the village as a \u201cunique 1,845-acre heritage estate\u201d that\u2019s barely changed for hundreds of years. The layout of Laxton and its farms today is pretty much the same as a 1635 map of the village held in Oxford\u2019s Bodleian library. A copy of the map hangs in the village\u2019s museum, where Stuart Rose, whose family has farmed in Laxton for 400 years, uses a long stick to explain the historical open field farming system that the new owner of the village will be legally bound to maintain for perpetuity. The giant map is cut up into tiny strips in a dozen colours, showing each of the village\u2019s farmers\u2019 rights to strips of land in the three large open fields. . Rose\u2019s strips are coloured pink on the map, but out in the field there is nothing to demarcate the boundaries. On the first Thursday of December, the village\u2019s manorial court \u2013 the lowest court in English law \u2013 meets in the Dovecote Inn pub to levy fines on farmers who strayed on to another\u2019s land or who left rubbish out in the fields. Fines imposed vary from 2p to \u00a320. The court leet of Laxton is the only one of its kind in the country to retain full powers to determine legal proceedings and levy fines. Rose, who farms the same land that his father and grandfather worked, said the new owner of Laxton will be bound to maintain the medieval court and farming system. \u201cObviously it\u2019s far less economical to have fields cut up into little strips \u2013 my sprayer is wider than some of my strips. But this is the only remaining example of open-field farming in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd everyone from the tenants to historians wants to keep it that way.\u201d The village was owned by the Earls Manvers until Gervas Evelyn Pierrepont, 6th Earl Manvers, sold it to the government in 1952 on the condition that the open-field system and manorial court would be maintained. In 1981 Laxton was passed to the Crown Estate, which manages the royal property portfolio on behalf of the Treasury. The Crown Estate, which owns \u00a314bn worth of real estate, including most of Regent Street and St James\u2019s in London, said: \u201cAs a commercial real estate business, we recognise we may not be best placed to manage the estate moving forwards and have therefore reached a decision to sell.\u201d A spokesperson for the Crown Estate said its focus would be on \u201cfinding an appropriate purchaser who values Laxton\u2019s unique role and history and who is fully committed to preserving it for the future\u201d. The University of Nottingham and Nottingham Trent University have both expressed interest in helping maintain the unique village and its history. The Crown Estate is legally bound to ensure it achieves the best return for the Crown, and the spokesperson said bids from rich private individuals would be considered if they can prove they have the commitment to maintaining Laxton\u2019s unique structures. \u201cThe purchaser will be required to clearly demonstrate the same intention to perpetually maintain the open field system through a positive relationship with present and future tenants and other local stakeholders,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cIn addition, a capacity in both organisational and financial respects to positively manage the estate in the long term must be shown, and the purchaser should ideally be able to demonstrate a track record of having successfully delivered sensitive management of the historic landscape and farmed environment at a comparable scale and complexity.\u201d Estate agents said the Laxton estate, which includes more than a dozen historic farm buildings and cottages set in 1,845 picturesque acres, would be worth at least \u00a320m and possibly as much as \u00a350m if it were not subjected to the legal covenants and \u201csympathetic rents\u201d. \u201cFifty years ago, farming here was a living for two generations, father and son. Now, a farm like ours is a part-time job for one person,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIt has left the village in a catch-22 situation; Laxton needs to be developed but the average age of the tenants is over 65. Tenants have lived in their homes all their lives, meaning young ones can\u2019t come in. Most of the sons and daughters have left the village, and they won\u2019t be coming back.\u201d Rose said he hoped one of this two daughters, a schoolteacher and a shop assistant, would take over his farm. \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility they might take it on,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to think they will take on a bit of knowledge from me and their grandfather and great-grandfather and take the village forward.\u201d",

Most of the sons and daughters have left the village, and they won\u2019t be coming back.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rose said he hoped one of this two daughters, a schoolteacher and a shop assistant, would take over his farm. \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility they might take it on,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to think they will take on a bit of knowledge from me and their grandfather and great-grandfather and take the village forward.\u201d</p>",

The retailer is also considering closing counters used by customers to return items from its George clothing ranges. \u201cIn a competitive retail market, where customers rightly expect great value and ease of service, we must always look at how we can work more quickly and efficiently for them \u2013 and inevitably, that means we need to consider changing the roles we need our colleagues to do or the hours needed in particular parts of our stores,\u201d said Asda in a statement. The proposals are thought to include combining back office functions such as administration, making some its petrol stations self-service, and reducing the hours of bakery staff and those employed as \u201cfront-end hosts\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Lloyds is to pay up to \u00a3150m to female members of its pension scheme after a landmark court ruling on sex discrimination that could lead to \u00a320bn in payouts for millions of women who work in the private sector. The high court ruled Lloyds should equalise pension payments for men and women, after three women brought a case against the bank, complaining that their pension incomes were increasing at a lower rate than those of male counterparts. Almost 3,000 members of BTU, the trade union representing Lloyds staff, later joined the case, in a class action lawsuit, leading to estimates that Lloyds might have to find as much as \u00a3500m to make up the shortfall. But Mr Justice Morgan narrowed down the methodology to be used to calculate the payments, which will now be between \u00a3100m and \u00a3150m. The BTU estimates 35,000 scheme members will see their annual retirement income rise by more than \u00a3500, with a further 8,000 members gaining \u00a33,000 or more. It believes the ruling will also lead to higher payments for 5 million members of more than 6,000 other retirement schemes, most of them female, with the total cost estimated by the government at between \u00a310bn and \u00a320bn. The union said: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, had we succumbed to the bank\u2019s bullying and jettisoned our principles for a seat at the \u2018negotiating\u2019 table we would not have been able to pursue this case on behalf of all pension scheme members. \u201cThe bank\u2019s two staff unions \u2013 Accord and Unite \u2013 talk the talk but when it comes to walking the walk to protect the interests of staff they are simply not capable of doing what\u2019s necessary. Naively they believe that cosying up to the bank will benefit their members \u2013 it won\u2019t.\u201d A spokesperson for Lloyds said: \u201cThe hearing focused on what is a complex and longstanding industry-wide issue. The group welcomes the decision made by the court and the clarity it provides. The group and the pension scheme trustee will be working through the details in order to implement the court\u2019s decision.\u201d The case revolved around guaranteed minimum pensions (GMP) for employees who contracted out of state pensions, allowing them and their employer to pay lower national insurance. Employers benefiting from the tax break then promise staff a pension equivalent to what they would have received from the state before opting out. Existing rules allow GMPs to be lower for women, due to their earlier retirement age. But the Lloyds ruling could force thousands of other companies to follow suit by equalising payments. The Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions were both listed as interested parties in the case, due to the potentially huge ramifications for the retirement payouts in the UK. According to some estimates, equalising GMPs could cost employers \u00a320bn.",

    "webTitle": "No 10 refuses to back calls for Philip Green to lose knighthood", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Downing Street has refused to back calls for Sir Philip Green to be stripped of his knighthood over sexual harassment and bullying allegations, saying it is a matter for independent review. After Peter Hain used parliamentary privilege in the House of Lords to name Green as the mystery figure at the centre of the allegations, MPs and others called for the title to be removed. However, a spokesperson said Downing Street did not have the power to make that decision. The spokesperson said on Friday that the independent body that oversaw such issues was \u201cconstantly reviewing evidence in relation to matters like this\u201d, adding that the prime minister had been clear that \u201cbullying and sexual harassment in the workplace is against the law and that kind of behaviour can\u2019t be tolerated\u201d. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, was among the MPs who called for Green to lose his honour. \u201cHe narrowly and luckily escaped losing his knighthood over the pensions scandal,\u201d he said, referring to the House of Commons\u2019 unusual move two years ago to back a motion calling for his knighthood to be removed over the collapse of BHS. \u201cIf these allegations are correct, he should certainly be stripped of his knighthood.\u201d Other MPs backing the call included Frank Field and Jess Phillips. The mayor of London Sadiq Khan joined calls for Green to be stripped of his honour should it be proven that the businessman signed off on non-disclosure agreements to stifle allegations of bullying and sexual harassment. Speaking in Brussels, Khan said: \u201cYou give knighthoods to those who have served our community and society. But I think just in the same way you reward good behaviour, I think you should punish bad behaviour\u201d. Among those to have lost their honours in the past are the former RBS chief executive Fred Goodwin and the former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe. All such decisions are made by the independent honours forfeiture committee \u2013 an ad hoc body led by a senior civil servant. They have to conclude that an individual is \u201cbringing the honours system into disrepute\u201d before removing any titles. Lord Hain defended his decision to name Green on Thursday. The former Labour cabinet minister said his decision to use parliamentary privilege to circumvent the courts was \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d. \u201cI considered it extremely seriously before I said it,\u201d said Hain, who has been criticised by some lawyers for his action. \u201cI\u2019m discharging my function as a parliamentarian. What concerned me about this case was wealth and the power that comes with it, and abuse.\u201d Hain told BBC Two\u2019s Newsnight: \u201cIt\u2019s for members of the public and others to judge whether I was right or wrong. There\u2019s no point in being there if you never discharge that and deploy the precious right of parliamentary privilege, to be used extremely carefully with integrity and very responsibly.\u201d Hugh Tomlinson QC, the founder of the Hacked Off campaign for press reform, told BBC Radio 4 the decision to name Green in defiance of the courts was \u201ccompletely improper\u201d, given the injunction was only a temporary restriction pending a full trial on whether the Daily Telegraph\u2019s story was in the public interest. \u201cParliament can\u2019t trespass into areas of the courts and say we think the courts have got it wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Lord Hain is effectively doing.\u201d Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP and former attorney general, also criticised Hain. \u201cIt was an entirely arrogant decision that had absolutely no regard for judicial process or the rule of law,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s World at One. \u201cParliamentary privilege is very important, but like any power which is extremely important it is open to abuse.

The newspaper said the allegations that Green had used non-disclosure agreements to limit coverage would \u201creignite the #MeToo movement against the mistreatment of women, minorities and others by powerful employers\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Downing Street has refused to back calls for Sir Philip Green to be stripped of his knighthood over sexual harassment and bullying allegations, saying it is a matter for independent review.</p> <p>After Peter Hain used parliamentary privilege in the House of Lords to name Green as the mystery figure at the centre of the allegations, MPs and others called for the title to be removed. However, a spokesperson said Downing Street did not have the power to make that decision.</p> <p>The spokesperson said on Friday that the independent body that oversaw such issues was \u201cconstantly reviewing evidence in relation to matters like this\u201d, adding that the prime minister had been clear that \u201cbullying and sexual harassment in the workplace is against the law and that kind of behaviour can\u2019t be tolerated\u201d.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, was among the MPs who called for Green to lose his honour. \u201cHe narrowly and luckily escaped losing his knighthood over the pensions scandal,\u201d he said, referring to the House of Commons\u2019 unusual move two years ago to back a motion calling for his knighthood to be removed over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/bhs-collapse-key-players-mps-report-sir-philip-green\">collapse of BHS</a>. \u201cIf these allegations are correct, he should certainly be stripped of his knighthood.\u201d</p> <p>Other MPs backing the call included Frank Field and Jess Phillips.</p> <p>The mayor of London Sadiq Khan joined calls for Green to be stripped of his honour should it be proven that the businessman signed off on non-disclosure agreements to stifle allegations of bullying and sexual harassment. Speaking in Brussels, Khan said: \u201cYou give knighthoods to those who have served our community and society. But I think just in the same way you reward good behaviour, I think you should punish bad behaviour\u201d.</p> <p>Among those to have lost their honours in the past are the former RBS chief executive Fred Goodwin and the former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe.</p> <p>All such decisions are made by the independent honours forfeiture committee \u2013 an ad hoc body led by a senior civil servant. They have to conclude that an individual is \u201cbringing the honours system into disrepute\u201d before removing any titles.</p> <p>Lord Hain defended his decision to name Green on Thursday. The former Labour cabinet minister said his decision to use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/26/naming-of-philip-green-will-reopen-issue-of-parliamentary-privilege\">parliamentary privilege</a> to circumvent the courts was \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI considered it extremely seriously before I said it,\u201d said Hain, who has been criticised by some lawyers for his action. \u201cI\u2019m discharging my function as a parliamentarian. What concerned me about this case was wealth and the power that comes with it, and abuse.\u201d</p> <p>Hain told BBC Two\u2019s Newsnight: \u201cIt\u2019s for members of the public and others to judge whether I was right or wrong. There\u2019s no point in being there if you never discharge that and deploy the precious right of parliamentary privilege, to be used extremely carefully with integrity and very responsibly.\u201d</p> <p>Hugh Tomlinson QC, the founder of the Hacked Off campaign for press reform, told BBC Radio 4 the decision to name Green in defiance of the courts was \u201ccompletely improper\u201d, given the injunction was only a temporary restriction pending a full trial on whether the Daily Telegraph\u2019s story was in the public interest.</p> <p>\u201cParliament can\u2019t trespass into areas of the courts and say we think the courts have got it wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Lord Hain is effectively doing.\u201d</p> <p>Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP and former attorney general, also criticised Hain.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an entirely arrogant decision that had absolutely no regard for judicial process or the rule of law,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s World at One. \u201cParliamentary privilege is very important, but like any power which is extremely important it is open to abuse. I can\u2019t see - looking at this particular matter - that Peter Hain can argue that he hasn\u2019t abused it.\u201d</p> <p>Green was named after the Telegraph said it had been blocked by the courts from reporting that he was the subject of allegations of \u201cdiscreditable conduct\u201d made by five employees, which the newspaper claims include allegations of sexual harassment, bullying and racial abuse.</p> <p>The newspaper said the allegations that Green had used non-disclosure agreements to limit coverage would \u201creignite the #MeToo movement against the mistreatment of women, minorities and others by powerful employers\u201d.</p> <p>Green, who is thought to have spent hundreds of thousands securing the injunction, denied allegations of wrongdoing, saying: \u201cTo the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations.\u201d</p> <p>Courts have no ability to restrict reporting on the activities of parliament, meaning that if an MP or peer speaks in the chamber then the media can report it.

      "bodyText": "The finance director at Patisserie Valerie\u2019s parent company has resigned amid an investigation into alleged \u201cfraudulent activity\u201d at the cake shop and cafe chain. The company said that Chris Marsh, who was suspended on 9 October and has since been arrested and bailed, had resigned \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d. The company said it was \u201creserving its position\u201d in relation to any potential claims against the executive, who served as company secretary as well as finance director. Hertfordshire police have declined to name the individual, but confirmed that a 44-year-old man from St Albans, where Marsh lives, had been arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation earlier this month. The Serious Fraud Office has confirmed that it has opened a criminal investigation into an individual but has not given further information. Patisserie Holdings, which has more than 200 cafes and nearly 3,000 staff, has called in forensic accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers to trawl through its accounts after saying that \u201cfraudulent activity\u201d had been uncovered that left the business close to collapse. The group\u2019s multimillionaire chairman, Luke Johnson, has been forced to use \u00a320m of his own money to keep the group in business after finding that it was nearly \u00a310m in debt instead of having \u00a328m in the bank, as it had last reported. Directors said they were unaware until 10 October that Patisserie Holdings\u2019 main trading subsidiary, Stonebeach, faced a winding-up petition from HMRC over a \u00a31m unpaid tax bill. Only Marsh and Paul May, Patisserie Holdings\u2019 chief executive, were on the board of Stonebeach until 11 October, when documents filed at Companies House this week show that Luke Johnson joined. This week the company said it had fought off the winding-up petition, which had been due to be heard next week. Separately, Patisserie Holdings said it was investigating share bonuses that were cashed in this year by both its chief executive and its finance director. Marsh made a profit of nearly \u00a32m from sales of the options this year, while May made more than \u00a32.6m. The company\u2019s statement did not suggest that any share options had been wrongly allocated or exercised, only that it was \u201cseeking to understand\u201d why the grant of options relating to 2015 and 2016 had not been \u201cappropriately disclosed and accounted for\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Global markets chalked up their longest weekly losing streak in five years on Friday, as Wall Street reacted to worse-than-expected results from US tech giants. The MSCI all-country world index, which tracks shares across stock markets in 47 developed and emerging countries, closed down 3.7% on Friday. The fifth consecutive week of losses would represent its worst period since May 2013. The global index has dropped by 9.5% since the start of the month, the second largest sell-off of the year following turmoil in February. British companies on the FTSE 100 fell by 0.92%, with the index hitting its lowest level in seven months at one point on Friday, before recovering slightly to the lowest close since March. The share price of the steel producer Evraz fell by more than 6%. The grocery delivery firm Ocado lost 5%, while BT Group, Royal Bank of Scotland and Royal Mail all dropped by more than 4%. The slide was matched on Europe\u2019s other large markets. Germany\u2019s Dax index fell by 0.94% while France\u2019s Cac 40 lost about 1.29%. Shares across Europe have suffered from nerves around the Brexit negotiations, with UK government ministers still insisting that leaving the EU without a deal is a possibility. Economists predict that a no-deal Brexit would cause significant damage to earnings for companies in the UK and Europe. The Italian government\u2019s dispute with the European commission over its budget has also added to the risk aversion in the EU. Italy\u2019s new government decided to increase spending dramatically, pushing the deficit to 2.4% of GDP, three times higher than planned. The commission rejected the budget under an EU review process. In the US, investors have grown increasingly concerned in recent weeks on the valuations of large firms, even as GDP growth in the world\u2019s largest economy has continued to impress. The latest US GDP figures, published on Friday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, showed annualised growth of 3.5% in the third quarter, after an even faster rate of 4.2% in the previous quarter. US GDP growth was supported by the strongest burst of consumer spending in nearly four years, but analysts questioned the sustainability of the boom. \u201cInvestors must be asking the question how much longer can consumers maintain this pace for,\u201d said Chris Towner, a director at risk management consultancy JCRA. Gregory Daco, chief US economist at consultancy Oxford Economics, said in a note to clients that the US economy \u201ccontinues to show resilience\u201d, but said he expects \u201cmore moderate growth in 2019\u201d. The US Federal Reserve is expected to continue on its path of raising interest rates, raising borrowing costs for firms around the world. Investors have also been spooked by the threat of disruption from a trade war between the US and China, prompted by the protectionism of the US president, Donald Trump. The robust performance of the US economy in the third quarter was overshadowed on Friday by the fallout from technology company results overnight, which showed revenue growth below analyst expectations, adding to concerns that American firms will be unable to sustain profits at current strong levels. Amazon on Thursday delivered record profits of almost $3bn for the last three months, but revenue growth was slower than expected. Alphabet also missed analysts\u2019 revenue expectations. The parent company of Google was also under pressure after a New York Times report alleging that it paid executives after they were accused of sexual harassment. \u201cWe\u2019re going through this transition where, earlier in the year, the corporate earnings results were just a blowout and now they\u2019re more mixed,\u201d said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management. \u201cThat\u2019s causing some of this volatility.\u201d New York\u2019s Nasdaq index was down 2.07% at close on Friday, continuing a bumpy week for US stocks. The S&amp;P 500 fell by 1.73% and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.19%. Media and communications stocks, banks and healthcare companies also took heavy losses on US markets. On currency markets, sterling fell against the US dollar to $1.2777, its lowest level in more than 10 weeks, before bouncing up to close at $1.2820. The euro also hit a 10-week low against the dollar during the day.",

The latest US GDP figures, published on Friday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, showed annualised growth of 3.5% in the third quarter, after an even faster rate of 4.2% in the previous quarter.</p> <p>US GDP growth was supported by the strongest burst of consumer spending in nearly four years, but analysts questioned the sustainability of the boom.</p> <p>\u201cInvestors must be asking the question how much longer can consumers maintain this pace for,\u201d said Chris Towner, a director at risk management consultancy JCRA.</p> <p>Gregory Daco, chief US economist at consultancy Oxford Economics, said in a note to clients that the US economy \u201ccontinues to show resilience\u201d, but said he expects \u201cmore moderate growth in 2019\u201d.</p> <p>The US Federal Reserve is expected to continue on its path of raising interest rates, raising borrowing costs for firms around the world. Investors have also been spooked by the threat of disruption from a trade war between the US and China, prompted by the protectionism of the US president, Donald Trump.</p> <p>The robust performance of the US economy in the third quarter was overshadowed on Friday by the fallout from technology company results overnight, which showed revenue growth below analyst expectations, adding to concerns that American firms will be unable to sustain profits at current strong levels.</p> <p>Amazon on Thursday delivered record profits of almost $3bn for the last three months, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/25/amazon-shares-record-profit-third-quarter\">revenue growth was slower than expected</a>.</p> <p>Alphabet also missed analysts\u2019 revenue expectations. The parent company of Google was also under pressure after a New York Times report alleging that it paid executives after they were accused of sexual harassment.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going through this transition where, earlier in the year, the corporate earnings results were just a blowout and now they\u2019re more mixed,\u201d said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management. \u201cThat\u2019s causing some of this volatility.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>New York\u2019s Nasdaq index was down 2.07% at close on Friday, continuing a bumpy week for US stocks.

      "bodyText": "The former Stock Exchange Tower in London\u2019s Square Mile has been sold for \u00a3385m to a Singaporean group that said it took advantage of Brexit uncertainty to strike the deal. The Singapore-listed City Developments Ltd, which is chaired by the billionaire businessman Kwek Leng Beng, has bought the freehold building at 125 Old Broad Street from the US-based private equity group Blackstone. Blackstone acquired the building for \u00a3320m in 2014, with reports suggesting it might sell for as much as \u00a3430m. \u201cThe short-term uncertainties surrounding Brexit have presented us with opportunities to acquire assets with deep value,\u201d said Frank Khoo, the group chief investment officer at CDL. The 27-storey building, close to the Bank of England, is CDL\u2019s second deal in London this year after a \u00a3183m transaction for Aldgate House in September. \u201cWe have confidence in the long-term fundamentals of London as a global financial hub with a robust office market,\u201d Khoo said. The former Stock Exchange Tower is home to tenants including the law firm King &amp; Spalding, China International Capital Corporation and the property agents Cushman &amp; Wakefield, who advised CDL on the deal. Andrew Hawkins, an international partner at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, said CDL had snapped up the building without any rival bidders, securing it at an \u201cattractive price\u201d. Foreign investors have shown strong interest in the London commercial property market in the past 18 months. In August, Goldman Sachs agreed the \u00a31.2bn sale and leaseback of its new London headquarters with Korea\u2019s National Pension Service. In May, China completed a reported \u00a3200m-plus deal to buy the Royal Mint Court site, overlooking the River Thames and opposite the Tower of London, and plans to convert it to its new UK embassy. Last July, the controversial \u201cWalkie Talkie\u201d skyscraper sold for \u00a31.3bn, a record price for a single building in the UK, to the property arm of Hong Kong\u2019s Lee Kum Kee Health Products Group. In March 2017, the \u201cCheesegrater\u201d, the tallest building in the City of London, was sold for \u00a31.15bn to CC Land, a Hong Kong-listed company controlled by the Chinese property tycoon Cheung Chung-kiu.",

      "bodyText": "Australian and Asian share markets continued to be gripped by a volatile mood on Friday as a rally from the previous day\u2019s bloodbath petered out amid concerns over global trade and economic growth. Trading screens managed to edge into the black in early trade thanks to a bounce on Wall Street overnight, which was helped by bargain-hunting and positive earnings from Microsoft. But by the afternoon, the sellers had taken control once more. In Sydney the ASX200 gained 16 points before dropping 0.6% by 3.30pm amid more concerns about the wealth manager AMP, which lost 25% of its value on Thursday. The index eventually closed up slightly by 0.02% but it is still heading towards its worst month since the global financial crisis. Bell Direct equities analyst Julia Lee said jittery sentiment about US corporate profits has been extended across Asian markets, particularly South Korea, which is a strong export economy. \u201cGiven the type of moves that we\u2019re seeing around the region, we\u2019re just seeing contagion,\u201d she said. The Aussie dollar, a popular trading proxy for Asia Pacific\u2019s economic fortunes, fell sharply to a 33-month low of US70.29c. The Nikkei finished down 0.4% in Tokyo and the Hang Seng was off 0.65% in Hong Kong. In China, the Shanghai Composite was down about 0.6% but, in a further sign that Beijing is concerned about the impact of US tariffs on its exports, the yuan dropped against the greenback to 6.9604 per dollar, its weakest level since January 2017. The yuan last traded at 7.0 during the global financial crisis in 2008. A depreciating yuan could inflame tensions with the Trump administration, which has threatened to declare China a currency manipulator if it lets the yuan fall to boost its exports. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1.04%, erasing tiny gains made in the opening hour and hitting its lowest level since February 2017. Analysts at Capital Economics sounded a cautious note, suggesting that the bounce on Wall Street on Thursday was only temporary as investor concerns about the economic outlook worsened. \u201cThe first, and most important [worry] is that Fed tightening and fading fiscal stimulus will cause the US economy to take a turn for the worse,\u201d the analysts said in a note to clients. \u201cThe second is that China\u2019s economy will continue to struggle. \u201cAs we have been arguing for a while now, these worries are likely to get worse over the next 12 months or so.\u201d Investors will get a chance to check the US economic pulse later on Friday when the government releases third-quarter GDP data. In currency markets, the pound barely moved at $1.28 and the euro was at 1.128. The euro edged lower against the dollar, extending weakness after European Central Bank president Mario Draghi said the bank\u2019s 2.6tn euro ($2.96tn) asset purchase program will end this year and interest rates could rise after next summer, despite fears about the monetary union\u2019s economic and political future. The single currency was 0.03% lower at $1.1371. The US dollar was off 0.11% against the yen at 112.29 . The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was 0.04% lower at 96.636. Oil prices gave up some ground after earlier rising on signals from Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister that there could be a need for intervention to reduce oil stockpiles. Brent crude fell 0.49% to $76.51 per barrel.",
