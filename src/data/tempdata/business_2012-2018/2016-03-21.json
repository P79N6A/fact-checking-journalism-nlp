ValueAct, the US hedge fund mentioned above, is the same crew that has bought 10.8% of Rolls, the UK\u2019s best engineering company, and successfully lobbied for a seat on the board. Rolls\u2019s chairman, Ian Davis, was rash to make the offer, as argued here at the time. After Valeant, the decision to roll out the red carpet looks ridiculous. Rolls shareholders, when they vote, should say no. MPs must not back down on Sports Direct Mike Ashley has gone where James and Rupert Murdoch feared to tread. Sports Direct\u2019s founder is refusing to attend a parliamentary select committee \u2013 or, rather, he says it is not his \u201ccurrent intention\u201d to turn up on 7 June.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector remains mired in recession following months of weak demand from foreign customers and depressed demand at home. The CBI industrial trends survey found that factory output fell over the three months to March at the fastest pace since September 2009, marking a steep decline in the sector dating back to last summer. The depressed state of manufacturing comes after the turmoil that hit the steel industry last year, which triggered factory closures and layoffs across north-east England and Wales. Last month it was the turn of food and drink manufacturers, according to the survey, despite a fall in the pound that economists expect to drive higher exports by the sector. The CBI said production is expected to rebound over the next three months, but argued the risks of further stagnation meant the chancellor should have done more in the budget to support manufacturers. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s director of economics, said: \u201cWhile the budget included several policies that should drive growth, the absence of further measures to support innovation, and research and development, was a missed opportunity to boost investment. The government\u2019s upcoming National Innovation Plan needs to address this vital issue.\u201d Month-on-month figures showed a slight improvement in activity, chiming with official data that shows a recent upturn in manufacturing output. The total orders balance improve to a three-month high of -14% in March after falling back to a four-month low of -17% in February from -15% in January and -7% in December. The survey of 471 manufacturers found that eight of the 18 manufacturing sub-sectors posted a decline in output. Two thirds of this decline, it said \u201creflected weakness in the food and drink sector, with localised flooding and mild weather potentially having hit production\u201d. However, analysts said an upswing in activity was unlikely during uncertainty around global trade and Brexit fears. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cManufacturers will continue to struggle this year amid weak overseas demand and slowing growth in consumers\u2019 real income this year, as inflation revives and the fiscal squeeze intensifies.\u201d Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cWhile the recent overall marked weakening of the pound and still low oil and commodity prices are welcome news for UK manufacturers, they will be concerned by current ongoing muted global economic activity and an uncertain outlook.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Steelmakers and the Scottish government are rushing to strike a deal to save two Lanarkshire steel mills, amid last-minute negotiations on environmental costs and European Union rules on state aid. However, fears are growing for Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales, with reports indicating its owner, Tata Steel Europe, could abandon a turnaround plan. Liberty House, owned by the businessman Sanjeev Gupta, is in talks with Tata Steel over a deal to buy the mothballed Dalzell and Clydebridge plants in Lanarkshire, which were shuttered last year as Tata slashed 1,200 jobs nationwide. A source close to the talks said they were happening at \u201cbreakneck speed\u201d in an attempt to seal a deal before Wednesday, when the Scottish government shuts down before elections in early May. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a focus on getting something agreed before the deadline,\u201d the source said. Sticking points are understood to include what guarantees the Scottish government can offer Liberty House without breaching EU rules on how much aid governments can offer businesses. Liberty House and Tata are also negotiating over how much of the steel mills\u2019 environmental liabilities would be taken on in any transaction. The source said Tata wanted to make a \u201cclean break\u201d with the mills by handing over responsibility for environmental costs to Liberty House immediately. Discussions are complicated by the fact that Tata Steel is in separate talks with potential buyers for its entire long products business, which at present includes the two mills. About 270 jobs were lost at Dalzell in Motherwell and Clydebridge in Cambuslang last October when Tata Steel scaled back its UK business. The firm, owned by the Indian conglomerate Tata, blamed high energy costs, the strong pound and competition from Chinese firms flooding the EU with cheap products. A second source close to the talks said that even if a sale was agreed before the Scottish government went into purdah, it might not mean that all of the workforce was rehired immediately. \u201cIf the deal goes through, it would be about building them [the mills] back up slowly,\u201d the source said. The Scottish Labour MSP John Pentland said: \u201cIf the sale is confirmed then the priority has to be to get people back to work as quickly as possible. \u201cThe Scottish government needs to ensure any further support or investment that may be required is rapidly put in place so that the return to work will not be delayed by the election.\u201d Liberty House has already rescued 150 jobs at a plant in Newport, south Wales, where it plans to recycle steel imported from other countries. The company has said it could eventually employ 1,000 people there if the government offers support to reduce its energy costs. But fears are growing for the future of Tata Steel\u2019s Port Talbot plant, where 1,000 jobs were expected to be lost as part of the turnaround plan. The steelworkers\u2019 union Community said reports that the turnaround could be abandoned altogether, threatening thousands more jobs, were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. The union spoke out after suggestions that Tata could recommend closing the plant at a board meeting next week. Community said this could affect a further 12,000 people, including contractors and the local supply chain. \u201cThe steelworks is the beating heart of Port Talbot and supports many thousands of jobs in the local economy,\u201d said Community\u2019s general secretary, Roy Rickhuss. \u201cThe ability to make steel is vital to the UK\u2019s entire industrial base. Even the prime minister has said that it is inconceivable that a country like Britain could lose its steelmaking capacity. \u201cThe UK government must join with us in calling on Tata to support Port Talbot and help make steel a profitable industry of the future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tesco has revamped its budget range of value products with a new range of own-label \u201cfarm\u201d brands as it steps up its fight against German discounters Aldi and Lidl. The seven brands comprise 76 new lines across fresh produce, meat and poultry that will either match the price of competitors or beat them. Where there is duplication, the products will replace those in its existing Everyday Value \u201cbasics\u201d range. Tesco hopes the colour-coded packaging using fictitious British-style farm names will attract shoppers. Woodside, Willow and Boswell Farms, for example, represent, respectively, fresh pork, chicken and beef, while Redmere Farms cover vegetables and Suntrail Farms imported fruit. Described as \u201cmeeting the need for a new level of quality at great prices\u201d, the range is a long-term addition to its shelves. Prices for fruit and vegetables range from 35p for a lettuce to \u00a31.69 for a punnet of raspberries. The initiative comes four years after Tesco Value \u2013 the \u00a31bn range of cheap, own-brand products that defined the company for the past 20 years \u2013 was relaunched as Everyday Value under the previous chief executive, Philip Clarke. The latest move, under his successor, Dave Lewis, who joined in September 2014, is part of a strategy to introduce easier to understand low pricing on a streamlined product range. A spokesperson said: \u201cOver the last 18 months we have been simplifying our ranges, launched Brand Guarantee and improved customer service. However, we know customers want the convenience of getting all their shopping in one place. These seven new brands, which are exclusive to Tesco, address our customers\u2019 needs for quality fresh food, at very competititve prices in a single shop.\u201d But the decision to use fictitious farm names at a time when Tesco claims to be supporting British farming attracted derision on social media. The National Farmers\u2019 Union questioned the use of \u201cphony\u201d or \u201cfake\u201d farms given how many real ones there were. A Tesco spokeswoman said some of the names, such as Nightingale and Rosedene, had previously been operating farms and were selected in partnership with its suppliers. \u201cIn all cases, the fresh food being sold under our new brands is sourced from a selection of farms and growers,\u201d she said. \u201cSome are small, family-run farms while others are of a larger scale \u2013 and every product has been reared or grown to specific standards from known and audited farms and growers.\u201d There are hopes that 2016 may be a better year for Britain\u2019s big supermarkets, which have been hit by a price war triggered by rising competition from Aldi and Lidl as well as changing shopping patterns. In its January update on Christmas trading, Tesco reported its first like-for-like sales growth for four years. Improving monthly industry data has followed, adding to hopes Britain\u2019s largest supermarket may finally be recovering. Last Tuesday, Sainsbury\u2019s revealed its first quarterly sales growth for more than two years, and earlier in the month Morrisons announced its first quarterly rise in underlying sales for four years.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A trading week shortened by the Easter break got off to a fairly uninspiring start. European markets ended slightly lower in the main, despite a strong performance from the Chinese market overnight. Weaker commodity shares proved a drag on the markets as metal prices steadied after recent gains, and oil drifted lower before turning higher again after comments from Opec. There was little economic data to distract investors, although what there was - US home sales, UK factory output and European confidence figures - proved disappointing. The pound continued to fall after the resignation of work and pensions minster Ian Duncan Smith raised new Brexit concerns. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 5.06 points or 0.08% at 6184.58 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.02% to 9948.64 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.78% lower at 4427.80 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.46% to 18,696.93 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.33% at 9021.0 In Greece, the Athens market fell 1.25% to 541.70 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 22 points or 0.13% after an earlier decline. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Oil prices are moving higher again after Opec secretary general Abdalla Salem el-Badri said all members of the oil producing group will be invited to a meeting on April 17. A number of producers want to freeze output at January levels in order to deal with a supply glut that has pushed crude prices sharply lower. El-Badri said Iran had no objection to the April meeting but has some conditions on its production. He said the only problem in the market at the moment was an overhang of 300m barrels, reports Reuters. Brent crude is currently up 0.29% to $41.32 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, has climbed 1.3% to $39.99. As markets drifted lower Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: It\u2019s been a disappointing start to the week for the FTSE-100, with sentiment not quite seeming able to keep pace with the fundamentals. Oil prices had been seen as weighing on the commodity stocks in trade earlier this morning but despite WTI crude breaking back above $40/barrel, the reaction in London has been rather muted. Admittedly we\u2019re scraping a finish that\u2019s as good as unchanged, but it\u2019s far from a spring-like hop towards fresh highs for the year. Here\u2019s our latest report on troubled pharmaceutical group Valeant: The chief executive of Valeant resigned on Monday, after the embattled Canadian drugmaker admitted that \u201cimproper conduct\u201d by senior management caused the company to misstate its financial results. Michael Pearson, who had returned to the helm last week after more than two months\u2019 sick leave with pneumonia, said he regretted the controversies the company has caused and will leave as soon as a successor is found. The company has also appointed the activist hedge fund investor William Ackman to its board. Valeant was a stock market darling under Pearson, who developed a strategy of buying up companies and dramatically increasing the price of undervalued drugs. However, such a \u201cprice gouging\u201d strategy has been attacked by both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and Valeant was called before Congress to explain. Two state attorney generals have opened investigations into the company\u2019s drug pricing. \u201cWhile I regret the controversies that have adversely impacted our business over the past several months, I know that Valeant is a strong and resilient company, and I am committed to doing everything I can to ensure a smooth transition to new leadership,\u201d Pearson said in a statement. While Pearson was on leave, Howard Schiller, former chief financial officer and a board member, took over as interim CEO. On Monday the company said Schiller had been asked to leave the board but had refused. The full story is here: The confidence figures are a worrying sign since consumers are key to future growth in the eurozone, says economist Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight. He said: A blow for Eurozone growth hopes as the European Commission reported overall consumer confidence weakened for a third month running in March - to be at a 15-month low. This will fuel concern over whether consumers will help eurozone GDP growth to pick up in the near term from current lacklustre levels \u2013 even though the fundamentals for consumers still look pretty decent. No breakdown is available yet of eurozone confidence in March but it seems significant that sentiment was yet again brought down in the Netherlands (to a 13-month low) and, to a lesser extent, in Belgium (to a five-month low) by increased concerns over the economy. Job worries were also up modestly in Belgium as were concerns over personal financial situations. Interestingly though, the index measuring consumers\u2019 willingness to buy rose in March in the Netherlands. Consumer confidence in Europe has fallen back so far in March, according to an initial survey by the European Commission. It slipped 0.9 points to -9.7 in the eurozone, and dipped 0.7 points to -7.3 in the wider European Union. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: With more than half of the members of the eurozone now in deflation, including Germany, France and Italy, it is little surprise that consumer confidence is plummeting. ECB president Mario Draghi is quickly running out of options, and the looming UK referendum on EU membership in June is serving up a large dish of insecurity across Europe. Uncertainly looks set to stay, as many observers predict another summer of increased economic migration, while pivotal upcoming elections in Germany and France could drastically change their political stances. Consumers may not be too confident for some time. Peter Praet, an executive board member of the European Central Bank, said last week that if other stimulus measures failed, the bank could even embark on \u2018helicopter money\u2019 and physically press cash into the public\u2019s hands, to force inflation up. Unsurprisingly, this idea seems to have gone down badly with the Bundesbank. Jens Weidmann, president of the German central bank, has reportedly warned of the dangers of helicopter money on bank balance sheets. Bloomberg reports: Weidmann warned against starting a discussion about handing out cash to stimulate growth, Funke Mediengruppe reported, citing an interview. \u201cHelicopter money isn\u2019t manna falling from heaven, but would rip huge holes in central bank balance sheets,\u201d Weidmann, who heads Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, said, according to the newspaper. \u201cThe euro area states and taxpayers would pay the bill in the end.\u201d ECB President Mario Draghi expanded the central bank\u2019s bond purchases and offer of cheap loans to banks this month to help stoke inflation. While monetary conservatives, including those at the Bundesbank, have warned against such steps, other ECB policy makers suggest they could go further. \u201cInstead of suggesting ever more reckless monetary policy experiments, it would make sense to pause,\u201d Weidmann was cited as saying in German. \u201cMonetary policy is not a panacea, doesn\u2019t replace the necessary reforms in individual countries and won\u2019t solve all of Europe\u2019s growth problems.\u201d Lawrence Yun, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said: Sales took a considerable step back in most of the country last month, and especially in the Northeast [down 17.1%] and Midwest [13.8%,lower]. The lull in contract signings in January from the large East Coast blizzard, along with the slump in the stock market, may have played a role in February\u2019s lack of closings. However, the main issue continues to be a supply and affordability problem. Finding the right property at an affordable price is burdening many potential buyers. There\u2019s some bad news from the US housing market with existing home sales falling sharply in February. The National Association of Realtors said home sales (excluding newly built houses) dropped by 7.1% to an annual rate of 5.08m, which is the lowest level since November. That compares to expectations of a fall of around 3% to 5.31m. Home sales have been volatile since the introduction of new mortgage regulations in October intended to help buyers shop around for the best loans suited to their financial circumstances. The new figures follow the US Federal Reserve deciding last week not to raise interest rates again after its December hike. Also on the way up in the US are Starwood Hotels, up 4% after an increased $13.6bn offer from Marriott, and business research group IHS, nearly 6% higher following news of a deal to buy data group Markit. With European markets edging down after a mixed morning, Wall Street has followed suit. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 11 points lower, as last week\u2019s rally ran out of steam. The S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.16% while Nasdaq has dipped a similar amount. But controversial pharmaceutical company Valeant has jumped 5% after news its chief executive was being replaced, although its finance director has refused a request to leave. Drama on Wall Street! Valeant, the trouble pharmaceutical company which has admitted misstating its financial results, has just announced that CEO Michael Pearson is stepping down. The search for a successor is underway, adding further uncertainty to Valeant just days after it delayed the publication of its annual report. In a statement, Pearson says: \u201cWhile I regret the controversies that have adversely impacted our business over the past several months, I know that Valeant is a strong and resilient company.\u201d In another development, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is joining the board. He\u2019s been a big investor in Valeant, and has suffered huge losses since the company began facing charges of price-gouging and sales mis-practices. But perhaps the most surprising news is that Valeant\u2019s board have accused former chief financial officer Howard Schiller of \u201cimproper conduct\u201d. They have asked Schiller to resign as a director, but he has not followed this request (!) There\u2019s a nifty GIF, showing how the UK government could raise \u00a34.4bn to replace the abandoned cuts to disability benefits: With the pound still down, analysts are wondering if Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s shock resignation could seriously dent confidence in the government. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit says the crisis could highlight David Cameron\u2019s weaknesses: Last week\u2019s budget is looking increasingly troubled too. MPs are due to vote on it this week, even though the Treasury has pulled a a screeeeeching u-turn and abandoned plans to cut disability payments by \u00a34bn. Chancellor George Osborne has even been given a vote of confidence.... French business chief Henri de Castries has moved a step closer to becoming the next chairman of banking giant HSBC. De Castries resigned as chief executive of insurance group AXA this morning, where he\u2019s worked for the last 27 years. And that has heightened speculation that he could replace Douglas Flint at HSBC. Our City editor Jill Treanor reports that de Castries was already in the frame, having recently become a director at the bank: The 61-year old was appointed to the board of HSBC last year as a non-executive director and is now cited a candidate to replace Douglas Flint who revealed on Friday that a search was underway for his successor. Britain\u2019s bank has already promised that its next chairman will not be selected from its top management team - breaking with tradition - and appoint an outsider to the role. Britain\u2019s factory sector suffered another drop in March, according to the latest CBI Industrial Trends Survey. The survey found that output volumes over the three months to March fell at the fastest pace since September 2009, with 8 of the 18 manufacturing sub-sectors posted a decline in output. Some factories are also struggling to win new orders; 20% of firms reported total order books to be above normal, and 34% said they were below normal, giving a balance of -14%. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Director of Economics, sees signs of improvement, though, saying: \u201cMarch has been a mixed month for the UK\u2019s manufacturers. Whilst total order and export books remained steady, a drop in output reflected some volatility in the food and drink sector. Reassuringly, manufacturers expect a swift turnaround in activity. European stock markets have shaken off their early losses, sending Germany\u2019s DAX up by 0.7%. Sterling is still suffering from the political tensions in Britain, says CMC\u2019s Jasper Lawler: The British pound was an underperformer in currency markets after the resignation of MP and former Tory leader Iain Duncan-Smith. A bit of internal party bickering doesn\u2019t normally impact Sterling but this time it has because of the possible implications for Brexit. Two data companies that we quote a lot in this liveblog are merging. IHS Global Insight, home of Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly and the ever-quotable analyst Howard Archer, is buying UK rival Markit in an all-share deal. Markit are probably best known for their Purchasing Managers Indices, or PMIs, which provide a regular snapshot of how The deal values Markit at $5.9bn; the combined company will be worth $13bn. A hefty sum, which shows the value of economic data. The CBI, which represents Britain\u2019s businesses, has also waded into the EU referendum debate. In a new report, it warns that Brexit could cost....\u00a3100 billion pounds (a figure which is crying out for a Dr Evil impression) Moneyweek\u2019s editor in chief, Merryn Somerset Webb, argues that it\u2019s hard to be totally confident about such a forecast: Alastair Winter, chief economist at investment bank Daniel Stewart, is hopeful that Britain will avoid a sterling crisis. Despite today\u2019s losses, he predicts the pound will hover at current levels until June\u2019s referendum is much closer. He tells me: I would expect sterling to loiter around $1.40 unless and until Brexit really looked like winning. A recent Reuters poll found that City economists were split 50:50 over whether the pound would really slump if the public vote to leave the EU. A total of 35 out of 69 predicted a full blown sterling crisis, which would have very serious implications for the Britain\u2019s ability to handle its balance of payments deficit. Winter also doesn\u2019t believe Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s resignation will shake the City too much. IDS was a disaster as Tory leader and is no firebrand. Many people believe he was out of his depth in implementing Universal Credits. I also doubt he is a market-mover. George &amp; Dave are undoubtedly wounded, but this profits Boris* more than Labour (except Sadiq Khan who was set to win the London mayoralty race anyway). I think investors will keep calm as they know Boris does not really believe in Brexit! * - that\u2019s chancellor George Osborne, prime minister David Cameron and outgoing London mayor Boris Johnson (a Brexit supporter and front-runner to succeed Cameron one day) Richard Benson, head of portfolio investment at currency managers Millennium Global in London, also believes the pound is suffering from the aftermath of Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s resignation. He told Reuters: \u201cSterling does not normally react strongly to UK politics so this is probably due to Brexit. \u201cThe referendum is just making people focus on issues like this a lot more. It is down in response this morning.\u201d Sterling has been falling this morning, after work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith sensationally resigned late on Friday. The pound fell by almost one cent against the US dollar, hitting a low of $1.4377. It is also down 0.4% against the euro, at \u20ac1.2803. Although the moves aren\u2019t huge, the City is taking note of Duncan Smith\u2019s shock decision to quit, and his attack on the \u2018deeply unfair\u2019 budget announced last week. It has exposed serious splits at the heart of the government, with some MPs supporting his criticism. IDS has denied that his resignation is motivated by June\u2019s referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union. But he is one of the most senior Brexit supporters, so his move to the back benches could intensity the battle over the EU. Kit Juckes, top foreign exchange strategist at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, says the Tory infighting could hurt the pound (which had rallied last week). The resignation of Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, will simply add another layer of political risk to sterling\u2019s prospects. \u2018Brexit\u2019 continues to dominate conversations, and the most alarming comment I\u2019ve heard so far was from a business student at a talk I gave last week: \u201cI\u2019d quite like the Uk to leave the EU, just to see what happened\u2019. Young educated Londoners are natural in favour of Europe and if they\u2019re torn between rebelling and not bothering to vote at all (older voters are much more likely to turn up at the ballot box, but also more likely to vote to leave the EU), that doesn\u2019t bode well. The row has also put Chancellor George Osborne under particular scrutiny. The opposition Labour party are calling for his resignation, after he cut disability benefit while also offering tax cuts to wealthier citizens. Our politics liveblog will have all the action, here: European Central Bank policymaker Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 is urging eurozone politicians to create closer economic and monetary union, or risk seeing the European project unravel. Speaking in Paris right now, C\u0153ur\u00e9 says European member states much achieve closer convergence, and create \u201ca euro area treasury\u201d to manage financial stability and implement fiscal tools. He also warns that the ECB can\u2019t be expected to solve Europe\u2019s economic problems on its own - something ECB chief Mario Draghi has been repeatedly warning too. C\u0153ur\u00e9 concludes his speech by warning that public against Europe is growing. The progress of European integration has increased interdependence between Member States. But we still haven\u2019t drawn all the necessary conclusions and European politicians still don\u2019t have the tools that would allow them to respond to the expectations placed on them. This shortcoming feeds popular frustration with European policies, sometimes to the point that they question European integration itself. There is nothing inevitable about the status quo, but, to move forward, we need to redefine a common project. It will take many years to implement this project. It is all the more urgent to start defining it. The rally in Chinese shares has not fed through to Europe. London\u2019s FTSE 100 dropped by 30 points, or 0.3%, at the start of trading. Natural resource stocks are leading the fallers, with Glencore and Anglo American losing 2.8%. They\u2019re suffering because the US dollar has recovered some strength (pushing down commodity prices). Commodities has already been a good way of losing money over the last decade: IMF chief Christine Lagarde has offered Beijing some support over the weekend. Speaking at the start of the China Development Forum, Lagarde said the government\u2019s latest five-year plan would help rebalance the country\u2019s economy. Lagarde also said China was going through \u201ca historic transition\u201d that is \u201cgood for China and good for the world,\u201d according to the official Xinhua news agency. Xinhua: Lagarde backs China\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan China\u2019s new encouragement for speculative stock market borrowing is part of a broader stimulus push, argues Chris Weston of IG. He writes: The Chinese government is clearly pining for the days of yore when domestic stocks and property investment both moved up in tandem. The China Securities Finance Corporation loosened controls on margin lending on Friday and Chinese markets have responded in kind, rallying aggressively as soon as they reopened. Heavy fiscal spending on the government\u2019s part has helped restart property construction in 2016, while monetary easing and weakening home purchase downpayment requirements have helped spur property sales. Weston suspects some policymakers have their own careers in mind... One wonders whether part of the reason behind this stimulatory push is due to the fact that top members of the Chinese leadership are positioning themselves for the five out of seven Politburo Standing Committee seats that will become available at 2017\u2019s 19th Party Congress. A flurry of buying activity has ripped through China\u2019s stock market today, after Beijing relaxed rules designed to prevent a bubble. The Shanghai composite index has spiked by over 2% to close at 3,020 points, a gain of 64 points, despite concerns over the Chinese economy. The trigger was news that Beijing will resume offering cheap loans to stock brokerages, which they can pass onto traders looking to invest in Chinese companies. Bloomberg has the details: China Securities Finance Corp., the state-backed agency that provides funding to brokerages for margin trading, will restart offering loans to securities firms for periods ranging from 7 days to 182 days, according to a statement posted on its website Friday. The agency will cut interest rates on the debt to as low as 3 percent, it said. So the scent of cheap money has its predictable effect on the trading floors. But investors perhaps shouldn\u2019t get carried away. Over the weekend, Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China governor, warned that corporate debt levels are too high. A hint of defaults and debt restructurings to come? Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After the recent drama from central bankers, there\u2019s a calmer feeling in the markets this morning. And with not much data in the calendar, it could be a bit of a drag. Still, all isn\u2019t lost, as two European Central Bank policymakers are out and about this morning. France\u2019s top man at the ECB, Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, is talking about governance in the eurozone \u2013 a cause of perennial worry for those who fear that politicians aren\u2019t doing enough to tackle the debt crisis. And vice-president V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio is in a cloudy London, discussing ways of \u201cexpanding market-based finance for sustainable growth\u201d. So that might yield some news. Here\u2019s the agenda 7.45am GMT: Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 speaks in Paris 9am: Eurozone current account for January 9.30am: Const\u00e2ncio speaks in London 11am: CBI survey of UK industrial trends We\u2019ll also be watching for any signs that investors are worried about the civil war raging in Britain\u2019s Conservative party: And there could be action in Greece, too, where negotiations over its bailout programme are dragging, again....",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct\u2019s founder Mike Ashley has challenged the authority of a parliamentary select committee by refusing to appear before MPs investigating pay and working conditions at the retailer, despite being formally summoned. The riposte, in which the billionaire called the parliamentarians \u201ca joke\u201d, is the latest instalment in an increasingly bitter battle between Ashley and the Commons\u2019 business, innovation and skills (BIS) committee, which took the unusual step of issuing a summons to the Newcastle United owner last week. The inquiry by the committee, which has threatened Ashley with being in contempt of parliament if he fails to attend a hearing on 7 June, follows a Guardian investigation last year that found workers at the sportswear group\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse were receiving, in effect, rates of pay below the minimum wage. Undercover reporters employed at the Derbyshire facility discovered thousands of workers were subjected to an extraordinary regime of searches and surveillance, while local primary schoolteachers told the Guardian pupils would remain in school while ill \u2013 and return home to empty houses \u2013 as parents working at the depot were too frightened to take time off work. However, in an interview with Sky News, Ashley said he would challenge the formal order and accused the MPs of \u201cshowboating\u201d. He said they cared only \u201cabout the business of politics, while I actually care about the people at Sports Direct\u201d. He added: \u201cI do not pretend to get everything right all of the time, but I am not willing to stand idle while this company is subjected to public vilification, which is against the best interests of everybody who works at Sports Direct. \u201cMy current intention is that I will not attend Westminster on 7 June as I believe the proposal by [BIS select committee chairman] Iain Wright MP \u2013 whom I have offered to meet in Shirebrook \u2013 is an abuse of the parliamentary process. I therefore intend to challenge the attendance order issued by the BIS committee and I will be sending a formal reply to the committee in due course.\u201d Wright declined to meet Ashley in Shirebrook, citing the \u201cselect committee\u2019s commitment to transparency\u201d. Separately, a group of local MPs have pulled out of a meeting with the billionaire at the depot, which had been scheduled for Monday. Wright said: \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed that Mr Ashley has refused to accept the committee\u2019s reasonable request to come and give evidence in parliament, like every other witness for every other select committee voluntarily does. \u201cIt is telling that he chose to give his response to the media rather than to the committee directly. We will be discussing this matter at the next committee meeting on Tuesday.\u201d Publication of the Guardian\u2019s investigation in December added to the pressure on what was then a FTSE 100 company, and came after the retailer had previously been accused of operating \u201cDickensian\u201d working practices at Shirebrook by the union Unite. The disclosures prompted the Institute of Directors to brand the company a \u201cscar on British business\u201d and former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna to file an urgent parliamentary question, which resulted in the business minister, Nick Boles, being summoned to the Commons to answer questions on the scandal. During the debate, a succession of MPs called for HM Revenue and Customs to investigate if the company had breached minimum wage legislation. Sports Direct responded by announcing a pay rise for its staff, as well as a review of all agency workers\u2019 terms and conditions, which was to be overseen by Ashley, who owns 55% of the retailer. The company was relegated from the FTSE 100 this month after a torrid three months in which \u00a31.6bn was wiped off its stock market value amid a slump in trading at its stores. Steve Turner, Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, said: \u201cMike Ashley\u2019s belligerent attitude to our democratically elected MPs is extraordinary and his attempts to brush off abusive work practices through bluster and insults is shameful. \u201cMore than 3,000 agency workers are employed by Sports Direct through Transline and the Best Connection in conditions which workers have likened to a gulag. If Mike Ashley is so confident that he has nothing to hide then he should have nothing to fear from appearing in front of MPs.\u201d Ashley claimed that his company was being publicly vilified. \u201cWe are in trouble \u2013 we are not trading very well. We can\u2019t make the same profit we made last year,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cWe are supposed to be taking the profits up, they are not supposed to be coming down, and the more the media frenzy feeds on it, the more it affects us.\u201d \u201cOnce you start to spiral a company down, you lose the momentum. We have all seen the effect that negative media can have on companies, and that spiral is growing. There is no question it is having an effect [on the business].\u201d",

He said they cared only \u201cabout the business of politics, while I actually care about the people at Sports Direct\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cI do not pretend to get everything right all of the time, but I am not willing to stand idle while this company is subjected to public vilification, which is against the best interests of everybody who works at Sports Direct.</p> <p>\u201cMy current intention is that I will not attend Westminster on 7 June as I believe the proposal by [BIS select committee chairman] Iain Wright MP \u2013 whom I have offered to meet in Shirebrook \u2013 is an abuse of the parliamentary process. I therefore intend to challenge the attendance order issued by the BIS committee and I will be sending a formal reply to the committee in due course.\u201d</p> <p>Wright declined to meet Ashley in Shirebrook, citing the \u201cselect committee\u2019s commitment to transparency\u201d. </p> <p>Separately, a group of local MPs have pulled out of a meeting with the billionaire at the depot, which had been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/16/mike-ashley-faces-further-ultimatum-to-appear-before-mps\">scheduled for </a>Monday.</p> <p>Wright said: \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed that Mr Ashley has refused to accept the committee\u2019s reasonable request to come and give evidence in parliament, like every other witness for every other select committee voluntarily does. </p> <p>\u201cIt is telling that he chose to give his response to the media rather than to the committee directly. We will be discussing this matter at the next committee meeting on Tuesday.\u201d</p> <p>Publication of the Guardian\u2019s investigation in December added to the pressure on what was then a FTSE 100 company, and came after the retailer had previously been accused of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/09/sports-direct-investors-revolt-against-chairman-and-pay-policy\">operating \u201cDickensian\u201d working practices at Shirebrook</a> by the union Unite.</p> <p>The disclosures prompted the Institute of Directors to brand the company a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/sports-direct-share-price-falls-following-guardian-working-practices-revelations\">\u201cscar on British business\u201d</a> and former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna to file an urgent parliamentary question, which resulted in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/14/sports-direct-crisis-grows-as-mps-and-investors-question-business\">business minister, Nick Boles, being summoned to the Commons to answer questions on the scandal</a>. During the debate, a succession of MPs called for HM Revenue and Customs to investigate if the company had breached minimum wage legislation.<br></p> <p>Sports Direct responded by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/31/sports-direct-pledges-10m-towards-staff-pay-rise\">announcing a pay rise for its staff</a>, as well as a review of all agency workers\u2019 terms and conditions, which was to be overseen by<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/mike-ashley\"> Ashley</a>, who owns 55% of the retailer.</p> <p>The company was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/01/sport-direct-falls-out-of-ftse-100-guardian-investigation-share-price-working-conditions\">relegated from the FTSE 100 this month</a> after a torrid three months in which \u00a31.6bn was wiped off its stock market value amid a slump in trading at its stores.</p> <p>Steve Turner, Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, said: \u201cMike Ashley\u2019s belligerent attitude to our democratically elected MPs is extraordinary and his attempts to brush off abusive work practices through bluster and insults is shameful.<br></p> <p>\u201cMore than 3,000 agency workers are employed by Sports Direct through Transline and the Best Connection in conditions which workers have likened to a gulag. If Mike Ashley is so confident that he has nothing to hide then he should have nothing to fear from appearing in front of MPs.\u201d</p> <p>Ashley claimed that his company was being publicly vilified. \u201cWe are in trouble \u2013 we are not trading very well. We can\u2019t make the same profit we made last year,\u201d he told the Times. </p> <p>\u201cWe are supposed to be taking the profits up, they are not supposed to be coming down, and the more the media frenzy feeds on it, the more it affects us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnce you start to spiral a company down, you lose the momentum. We have all seen the effect that negative media can have on companies, and that spiral is growing. There is no question it is having an effect [on the business].\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s warning that George Osborne\u2019s budget will hit poorer families hardest while preserving the incomes of the better off and pensioners has been backed up by an influential thinktank. Sustained benefit cuts will result in many households in the bottom 20% of earners losing up to 12% of their income by 2019, according to a report published on Monday by the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). Meanwhile, households in the top half of income brackets will be no worse off and even the poorest pensioners will be 2% in the red at most. The former work and pensions secretary resigned on Friday, accusing Osborne of delivering a \u201cdeeply unfair\u201d budget that inflicted substantial reductions in disability benefits while offering tax cuts for the most affluent. The report said the tax and benefit changes from April last year to 2019 would end a period when income distribution was squeezed, mainly as a result of top earners paying higher taxes and suffering the withdrawal of generous pension-saving subsidies. Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, said: \u201cRaising the threshold for paying higher-rate tax is clearly helping people in the middle- and upper-income brackets, while the cuts to benefits reduce the incomes of families on lower incomes.\u201d He highlighted the switch from tax credits to universal credit as a major blow to working households at the bottom of the income scale. \u201cOnce universal credit is in place, the benefit system is much less generous,\u201d he said. Duncan Smith was responsible for introducing universal credit and unsuccessfully fought Treasury demands for it to be less generous than the current tax credit system. In recent years, he has argued for some pensioner benefits such as the winter fuel allowance to be means tested so the government could show that all groups are sharing the pain of austerity. A chart in the report illustrating the impact of tax and benefit changes until the end of the current parliament shows the lowest 10% of households with children losing almost 10% of their income, while the next band lose more than 12%. The poorest 10% of pensioners lose 2% of their income; pensioners in the top 20% of earners gain or avoid losing any income at all. The IFS report stated: \u201cPensioners are protected while poorer working-age households are hit hard, especially those with children. This is the result of the continued protection of pensioner benefits (including maintaining the \u2018triple lock\u2019 on the basic state pension) while making further deep cuts to working-age benefit spending. \u201cHouseholds in the upper half of the income distribution (but below the very top) are likely to see little direct impact of tax and benefit changes on their incomes on average, as some benefits cuts and small tax rises are offset by further increases in the income tax personal allowance, and the raising of the higher-rate threshold.\u201d",

In a surprise announcement the company said Wood would step down from the top job in April, while staying on until July to help with the transition to a new chief executive in the form of Ian Kellett, currently finance director. Explaining his decision, Wood said: It has been a privilege to lead Pets at Home for four years, but after over 8 years working in the north west, and with my children growing up fast, I feel the time is right for me to be based in London with my family. Wood will be paid his salary until his leaving date, with a bonus paid for the period depending on performance targets. Up to 20% of his share related plan could be paid once the full year figures are assessed. Last year he took home \u00a3790,461 including pension, bonus and other benefits. The company also said it was trading in line with expectations. But its shares have dipped 0.2p to 284.8p. HSBC analyst Andrew Porteous issued a buy note with a 340p price target and said: Nick Wood leaves the business having instilled a strong service-led culture and put in place a platform that should help Pets at Home capitalise on its significant growth opportunities in pet retail and adjacent niches such as vets and grooming... We see this as a natural succession and expect little interruption to the strategy: This is critical given the considerable upside we see in the Pets at Home story through capitalising on the core growth opportunities of rolling out stores, vets and groomers which should support growth for at least the next decade. Consolidation of adjacent niches such as referral hospitals is incremental and could support growth thereafter, building a business with considerable competitive advantages, defensive growth prospects and attractive cash generation... We expect fourth quarter trading to highlight similar trends to those seen in the third quarter, with around 2% Merchandise like for like growth supported by high single-digit growth in Advanced Nutrition, around 4% growth from new stores and 20% plus growth in Services driven by the rollout and maturation of vets and groomers. Liberum analysts were also positive, saying: The change in management is unexpected, but we take confidence from the experience of the new chief executive and the wider management team. We are also encouraged by the in line trading which should provide further reassurance following the strong third quarter update in late January. We would see any weakness in the shares today as a good opportunity to buy.",

Next is 30p lower at \u00a366.05 and home shopping specialist N. Brown is down 14.2p at 345.8p after the bank\u2019s comments. But Sainsbury\u2019s is up 6.7p at 279.9p as Nomura lifted its target price from 250p to 280p. Miners are also among the fallers as the US dollar recovers some lost ground, and oil prices slip again. Brent crude is down 1% at $40.79 a barrel in the wake of Friday\u2019s news of an increase in US rig counts, albeit a small one, which raised renewed fears of a continuing supply glut. A dearer US currency makes commodities more expensive for dollar holders, helping to undermine the sector, while investors are also unsetteld by some mixed signals from China. There has been another attempt at economic stimulus, with Beijing again offering cheap loans to stock brokerages, which they can pass onto traders looking to invest in Chinese companies. But over the weekend Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, warned that corporate debt levels are too high. So Anglo American is down 12.6p at 542.8p and Antofagasta has fallen 10p to 504.5p. But overall the FTSE 100 is up 20.07 points at 6209.71, even though concerns of a Brexit have grown following the resignation of Ian Duncan Smith as UK work and pensions minister, exposing a split in the Conservatives which could give the advantage to the anti-EU camp. Pharmaceuticals group Shire is leading the risers, up as analysts at Exane BNP Paribas said the stock looked too cheap after falling since unveiling its plans to take over US business Baxalta.",

Warren East, Rolls-Royce\u2019s chief executive, will meet local MPs at the House of Commons on Tuesday in response to requests made after the company\u2019s profit warning in November. Rolls-Royce said more workers were needed at its Derby base to assemble its Trent XWB engine as production increases to fulfil orders. Some of the posts will be filled by workers from other parts of the Derby operation but most will be new jobs, the company said. The company announced 2,600 job cuts in November 2014 that mostly affected workers at the Derby plant and in Bristol. More recently it has shed 200 senior managers with some of those jobs going in Derby, as East has sought to cut layers of management in response to falling sales. A company spokesman said: \u201cAs we ramp up production of the Trent XWB to deliver on \u00a330bn-worth of orders, we are working with employee representatives to increase the size of the workforce involved in assembling the engine. \u201cRolls-Royce is committed to the UK and we have announced well in excess of \u00a3400m of investment in new facilities here in the last couple of years alone, including \u00a330m on the extension of our Trent XWB production facility in Derby.\u201d MPs who wrote to East included Conservatives Heather Wheeler, the MP for South Derbyshire, and Pauline Latham, who represents Mid Derbyshire. East\u2019s jobs pledge may not be enough to reassure MPs about the company\u2019s commitment to Derby, the Financial Times, which reported the new jobs (paywall), said. East will make the case for the government to support Rolls-Royce\u2019s research for its fuel-efficient UltraFan engine and argue that more workers on the XWB assembly line shows that state backing pays off in jobs. The company opened a test centre for large civil engines in Dahlewitz, Germany, in 2014, raising concerns that it would make UltraFan there. The engineering group, which makes engines for Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliners and Airbus\u2019s A380 superjumbos, has issued five profit warnings in less than two years. Underlying profits for 2015 fell 12%, to \u00a31.4bn from \u00a31.6bn, the company said last month as it cut its dividend for the first time in almost 25 years.",

      "bodyText": "On Friday, the release of 2013-14 taxation statistics showed that the then record low interest rates led to a fall in the amount of negative gearing deductions. The average net rental loss in 2013-14 was the lower than any year since 2002-03. The annual release of data also revealed that while more people have shifted into the top two tax brackets, three quarters of tax payers earn less than $80,000, and that 52 millionaires were able to reduce their taxable income so much, they ended up paying no tax at all (well, strictly speaking it was 51 millionaires - the 52nd paid the grand total of $4 in gross tax). In August 2013 the Reserve Bank cut the cash rate to a then record low 2.5%. While this was great for home owners and certainly spurred investors to buy homes and apartments, it actually is not great news for those who love to negative gear. To negative gear, the losses you incur from owning the house must be greater than the income you receive from renting it out. Such losses can be, for example, council rates, or re-painting the walls, or putting up a patio or installing an air conditioner. But by far the biggest loss the owners of investment properties incur is the interest they pay on their loan: Back in 2011-12 when for five months of the financial year, the cash rate was 4.75%, the total loss on interest payments claimed was $24.2bn while the income from rent was $34bn. In 2013-14 the income from rents had risen to $38.8bn, but the interest payment losses claimed had fallen to $21.4bn. As a result total profits from renting rose 5.3% to $7.25bn, while the total loses fell 12.5% to $10.97bn \u2013 for a total net rental loss of $3.72bn at an average loss of $1,828 for Australia\u2019s 2.03m landlords: While the interest rates may have lowered the ability to claim a loss, it certainly didn\u2019t dim Australian\u2019s love of investing in housing. In 2013-14, 13% of tax payers claimed a rental loss \u2013 down on the record 13.4% in 2012-13 \u2013 and 8% claim a rental profit. The 21% of taxpayers as landlords was a new record: Given in 2014-15 interest rates were cut even further, it is likely that next year will see another fall in the amount being claimed for negative gearing. Crucially, in light of the ALP\u2019s policy to reduce the level of negative gearing, this may suggest the budgetary savings are lower than they currently expect. Interestingly, for the 52 millionaires who were able to bring their taxable income to below $10,000, negative gearing wasn\u2019t the big factor. The 16 of those individuals who did own rental property ended up making a combined net-rental profit of $585,386. And yet despite earning a combined $121.99m in 2013-14 for an average income of $2.35m, these 52 were able to avoid paying any tax, except for the millionaire who paid the $4 (but don\u2019t worry, all 52 ended up paying no net tax). How did they do this? Well it helps to have a good accountant. Twenty three of them spent a combined $44.4m ($1.93m on average) towards the \u201ccost of managing their tax affairs\u201d \u2013 itself a deduction. All up there was a combined $70.6m in deductions which together with losses brought forward and other business expenses helped bring their total combined income to a loss of $19.2m. It\u2019s all a bit absurd, and certainly it seems they are understating just how much they earn. For example the lone millionaire who was able to get his (or her) taxable income down to $9,057 claimed a total income of $4.669m, and yet reported $4.59m in gifts or donations. Indeed all up 13 of the 52 millionaires gave $19.28m in gifts and donations, at $1.48m on average. That\u2019s a fair whack given they\u2019re also spending nearly $2m each on tax affairs. But the tax data does show that the richest 1% by taxable income (which does not include those 52 millionaires) do pay a large shares of total tax. In 2013-14 the top 1% paid 17% of all income tax \u2013 up from 16.1% in 2012-13, but well down on the highs of 18.5% that occurred in 2007-08: Largely this is because the top 1% don\u2019t earn as much of the total income as before. In 2013-14 they earned 9.5% of Australia\u2019s income, down on the 10.5% share they took in the midst of the mining boom in 2006-07 and the 10.5% just prior to the GFC in 2007-08: But don\u2019t feel too badly for them, to get in the top 1% your taxable income in 2013-14 needed to be over $324,586 \u2013 a 3.8% increase on the 1% cut off of $312,501 in 2012-13. The median total income of the top 1% was $466,065 for women and men a touch higher at $475,030. They make up part of the 2.9% of all individuals who are in the top tax bracket \u2013 an increase from 2.7% in 2012-13 and well up on the 2.3% in 2011-12. Bracket creep has been all the rage this year with Scott Morrison arguing that workers on average earnings are now in the second highest tax bracket for those with incomes between $80,001 and $180,000. But the tax stats remind us that average does not equal median. The big incomes of the wealthiest skew the average upwards; for in 2013-14 only 16.6% of individuals were in the second higher tax bracket. Earning $80,000 would see you in the 75th percentile of the 9.7m people who paid net tax in 2013-13, meaning you earned more than 74% of all people with a taxable income. That is little changed from 2012-13 \u2013 in that year having a taxable income of $80,000 would have meant you earned more than 75% of individuals. However this is a fair drop since 2008-09 when $80,000 became the threshold for the second highest bracket. Back then earning $80,000 would have put you in the 85th percentile. The current level is similar to back in 2003-04 when the second highest tax bracket kicked in at $52,000 \u2013 which was a taxable income that would have seen you earning more than 76% of individuals. And while in 2013-14 the average taxable income was $72,383, the median taxable income in 2013-15 was $53,959, paying $9,655 in tax. The data once again highlights the progressive nature of our income tax system, with all but those in the top 20% paying a lower share of tax on average than their share of total income:",

In 2013-14 the top 1% paid 17% of all income tax \u2013 up from 16.1% in 2012-13, but well down on the highs of 18.5% that occurred in 2007-08:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of total tax paid by taxable income percentiles\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KEh8i/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Largely this is because the top 1% don\u2019t earn as much of the total income as before. In 2013-14 they earned 9.5% of Australia\u2019s income, down on the 10.5% share they took in the midst of the mining boom in 2006-07 and the 10.5% just prior to the GFC in 2007-08:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of total income earned by income percentile\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CHxFw/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But don\u2019t feel too badly for them, to get in the top 1% your taxable income in 2013-14 needed to be over $324,586 \u2013 a 3.8% increase on the 1% cut off of $312,501 in 2012-13. The median total income of the top 1% was $466,065 for women and men a touch higher at $475,030. </p> <p>They make up part of the 2.9% of all individuals who are in the top tax bracket \u2013 an increase from 2.7% in 2012-13 and well up on the 2.3% in 2011-12. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/nov/09/equality-is-built-into-our-tax-system-thats-why-morrisons-sums-dont-add-up\">Equality is built into our tax system \u2013 that's why Morrison's sums don't add up | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bracket creep has been all the rage this year with Scott Morrison arguing that workers on average earnings are now in the second highest tax bracket for those with incomes between $80,001 and $180,000. </p> <p>But the tax stats remind us that average does not equal median. </p> <p>The big incomes of the wealthiest skew the average upwards; for in 2013-14 only 16.6% of individuals were in the second higher tax bracket. </p> <p>Earning $80,000 would see you in the 75th percentile of the 9.7m people who paid net tax in 2013-13, meaning you earned more than 74% of all people with a taxable income. That is little changed from 2012-13 \u2013 in that year having a taxable income of $80,000 would have meant you earned more than 75% of individuals. </p> <p>However this is a fair drop since 2008-09 when $80,000 became the threshold for the second highest bracket. Back then earning $80,000 would have put you in the 85th percentile. </p> <p>The current level is similar to back in 2003-04 when the second highest tax bracket kicked in at $52,000 \u2013 which was a taxable income that would have seen you earning more than 76% of individuals. </p> <p>And while in 2013-14 the average taxable income was $72,383, the median taxable income in 2013-15 was $53,959, paying $9,655 in tax. </p> <p>The data once again highlights the progressive nature of our income tax system, with all but those in the top 20% paying a lower share of tax on average than their share of total income: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of total income &amp; net tax by income decile, 2013-14\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wjHST/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>",
