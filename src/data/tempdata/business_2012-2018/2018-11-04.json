      "bodyText": "British Airways has been accused of providing \u201cdeplorable service\u201d after more than 100 London-bound passengers were stranded in the US for nearly three days due to a technical fault on a plane. Passengers said their children were forced to sleep on the floor of New York\u2019s JFK airport after their flight from Orlando in Florida to London was diverted. Flight BA2036 was scheduled to leave Orlando on 1 November at 19.25 ET and arrive in London eight hours later. But after being held up by a \u201ctechnical defect\u201d and then a diversion to New York, it did not arrive in London until Sunday 4 November, 77 hours late. The airline put up passengers in a hotel for the night in Orlando and returned them to the aircraft after repairs were made. The flight was diverted to New York after a further \u201cminor technical issue\u201d. Passengers said many people were stranded at JFK without information, accommodation or access to food or drink for several hours. Ceri Todd, from Mumbles in Wales, said she was on the flight with her husband and two teenage children, who spent seven hours trying to sleep on the floor of the terminal before being moved to a departure lounge. Describing it as \u201cthe journey from hell\u201d, she said there were fire engines on the JFK tarmac when the plane landed but no BA staff to greet passengers. \u201cThere was a lack of leadership, a lack of strategy and there didn\u2019t appear to be any plan in place for when things like this happen.\u201d Another passenger, Rosie Slater Watts, said her children had to bed down for more than five hours on a JFK terminal floor. She told the Guardian: \u201cWe were treated with contempt and like we didn\u2019t matter. When we got on the aborted flight, the customer care manager advised us that they weren\u2019t sure the aircraft had been fixed. No way would we ever use BA again.\u201d BA said in a statement: \u201cWe appreciate that this was an exhausting and frustrating experience for our customers, and we have apologised for the long delay to their flight. Customers were rebooked where possible and while there were limited hotel rooms available, our teams on the ground cared for customers in our first class lounge providing bedding, food and drinks to ensure they were comfortable during their stay.\u201d The company said it had been unable to find accommodation for all passengers because the New York marathon meant that hotels were fully booked.",

    "webTitle": "Wonga compensation claimants may lose out due to automation plan", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Administrators for Wonga, the controversial payday lender which went bust this year, are planning to automate the process of judging thousands of outstanding compensation claims, leading campaigners to voice concerns that some customers could lose out. Accounting firm Grant Thornton is in the process of winding up Wonga, after it collapsed in August under the weight of costly claims for compensation over mis-sold loans. The administrators are planning to create an \u201cadjudication tool\u201d which will automatically decide which claims are valid in order to save on the costs of manual processing, according to documents seen by the Guardian. David Clarke, head of policy at Positive Money, a financial campaign group, warned that a computer-based system could put customers at a disadvantage. \u201cAfter having been mis-sold loans by automated software, Wonga customers may now be forced to appeal to a similar automated system,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as Wonga\u2019s algorithms failed to account for individual circumstances when making loans in the first place, there are risks that this technology will again fail to take all the relevant factors into account when processing claims, leaving many customers out of pocket.\u201d Wonga had repeated run-ins with regulators because it levied interest rates that reached as high as 5,853% per annum offered to customers often unable to afford them. It wrote off loans worth \u00a3220m in 2014 after regulators introduced new affordability checks. Stella Creasy, the Labour MP and leading campaigner on payday lending issues, said she was concerned that compensation claimants who are still in debt to Wonga for other loans may lose out. She said: \u201cThere is a very real risk those who are owed money by Wonga in compensation for having been lent money irresponsibly may be chased by creditors for this money, whilst losing access to the compensation to which they are entitled. \u201cIt\u2019s time the government stepped in to oversee this process to ensure this legal loan shark doesn\u2019t keep ripping off customers even after its demise.\u201d There has been significant interest in acquiring assets from the administration which include its technology, equipment and loan book. Some 60 parties have expressed an interest in the assets, while 27 have signed non-disclosure agreements in order to inspect them more thoroughly, according to the documents. Any buyer of the loan book would not be liable for the compensation claims which sank Wonga, but would be entitled to chase its former customers for debts. The payout to customers entitled to compensation, who rank as unsecured creditors, \u201cwill not be the full value of the accepted claim but will be significantly less\u201d, the document said. Nicky Morgan the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the financial services regulator, must in future cases \u201cprevent consumer detriment before it occurs\u201d, and called for it to limit other forms of high-cost credit as quickly as it can. She added: \u201cThe demise of Wonga shows that the business model of many payday loan companies is based on its unfair treatment of customers, many of whom were in vulnerable situations.\u201d When Wonga collapsed it faced more than 24,000 complaints from customers, while another 9,500 are with the Financial Ombudsman Service. Claims have also continued to stream in at a rate of 200 to 500 claims per day after the appointment of administrators on 30 August, according to the letter to creditors, sent on 24 October. The automated process of deciding which claims are valid will be \u201caligned as closely as possible\u201d to the methodology used by the FOS, the administrators said. The FCA has also been informed of the plans. A spokesperson for Grant Thornton said: \u201cThe joint administrators have issued their initial proposals to the companies\u2019 creditors on the progress of the administration. The proposals are currently being considered by the creditors, who have until 9 November 2018 to offer views, and include updates on the trading conditions of the companies and details on other material financial matters. \u201cThe administrators are continuing to conduct an orderly wind down of the business in accordance with their statutory obligations and continue to work closely with the Financial Conduct Authority.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The chair of Patisserie Valerie, Luke Johnson, has waived his salary and pledged to give up some of his other jobs as he battles to turn around the cake shop after an accounting scandal. The multimillionaire has told the board of the chain\u2019s listed parent company that he will not collect his \u00a360,000 annual salary for his remaining time at the group. Johnson, 56, has been under pressure from angry shareholders since the group\u2019s shares were suspended last month. Patisserie Holdings, the cake shop\u2019s parent company, which has more than 200 cafes and nearly 3,000 staff, has been forced to raise more than \u00a325m in new cash through discounted share placings and an emergency loan from Johnson after saying that \u201cfraudulent activity\u201d had been uncovered that left the business close to collapse. At a stormy emergency shareholder meeting last week Johnson was asked if he planned to reduce his activities. He told shareholders he now had only one executive position, as chair of Patisserie Holdings. But the entrepreneur sits on the board of at least 17 operating companies, more than half of which he chairs. If all subsidiaries are included the number rises to 34, including Stonebeach, a subsidiary of Patisserie Holdings, which was served with a winding up order by tax authorities in relation to an unpaid bill. Johnson only moved on to Stonebeach\u2019s board after the winding up order came to light and the company admitted it was teetering on the brink of collapse having found a multimillion-pound black hole in its accounts. Johnson has already stepped down from boards of theatre marketing group AKA, theatre company Generation of Z and Beak Street Films as well as swimming goggles maker Zogg, according to the Mail on Sunday which first reported Johnson\u2019s pay cut. It is understood that he plans to relinquish further board positions in coming weeks. He remains chair of at least 11 boards including London\u2019s Almeida theatre, the Institute of Cancer Research, entrepreneurial campaigning groups Startup Britain and five investments by Risk Capital \u2013 his investment company \u2013 including Gail\u2019s bakery owner Bread Holdings, Brighton Palace Pier and Majestic Bingo, as well as Patisserie Holdings. He is also a non-executive director at theatre production investment firm Fiery Dragons; Brompton Bicycle; property firm Galliard Group; Elegant Hotels Group and Forestrox, a company linked to theatre entrepreneurs Guy Hornsby and William Burdett Coutts. Johnson is leading an internal inquiry involving forensic accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers. Patisserie Holdings\u2019 finance director, Chris Marsh, resigned last month. Shortly before his resignation, Marsh was arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation. The Serious Fraud Office has confirmed that it has opened a criminal investigation into an individual but has not given further information. The company fought off the winding-up petition but has faced anger from investors whose shares have been devalued by the sale of discounted stock to fund an emergency cash injection.",

      "bodyText": "The US has its lowest unemployment rate since Richard Nixon was in the White House 48 years ago. Wages are growing at their fastest rate in almost a decade. No other G7 country will come close to matching America\u2019s growth rate this year. All of which ought to be a concern for Donald Trump. If that sounds weird, consider the facts. When running against Hillary Clinton in 2016, Trump said he would put the world\u2019s biggest economy back to work and so far he is doing so. He said he would repudiate or rewrite the \u201chorrible\u201d trade agreements his predecessors entered into and he has been as good as his word. The promise in his inauguration speech to put \u201cAmerica first\u201d has been met in full. Yet if the opinion polls are right (a big if), it won\u2019t be enough for the Republicans to maintain their stranglehold on Congress. The Democrats are confident of winning the House of Representatives and think there is a chance of taking the Senate as well. And that matters, because this is as good as it is going to get during Trump\u2019s first term. And if the Republicans are struggling during the midterm elections, it doesn\u2019t bode awfully well for Trump\u2019s hopes of winning another four years in the White House come 2020. Last week\u2019s jobs report illustrates why there is trouble ahead. Non-farm payrolls \u2013 the benchmark for employment in the US \u2013 showed a net 250,000 increase in October. Although the official unemployment rate of 3.7% understates the real level of joblessness, shortages of labour are putting upward pressure on pay. This needs to be put into context. The economy has been growing for almost a decade and yet wages are growing only modestly once inflation is taken into account. Even so, the pick up in earnings growth to 3.1% last month will certainly be enough to trigger a fresh increase in interest rates from America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, before the end of the year. Trump is unhappy about the Fed\u2019s hawkish approach to interest rates, with some justification. By American standards, the recovery from the financial crisis of 2008-09 has been modest, with none of the snap back in growth that traditionally happened after other postwar recessions. There is certainly a case for the Fed showing greater restraint; there are already signs that higher interest rates are slowing the housing market. Trump has not helped matters. His public denunciations of the Fed make it hard for the central bank to desist from its planned tightening of policy without looking weak. What\u2019s more, Trump\u2019s loosening of fiscal policy through the package of tax cuts and spending increases announced at the end of 2017, has added to Fed concerns that the economy is at risk of overheating. The most eye-catching part of Trump\u2019s plan was a cut in corporation tax from 35% to 21%. Companies would keep more of their earnings, and this would unleash a wave of investment. Higher investment would boost the growth potential of the US economy, allowing it to expand faster without inflation picking up. Unfortunately, there is not much sign of this happening. US investment growth has accelerated slightly in 2018 and was 6.7% higher in the first three quarters of the year than in the same period a year earlier. It was actually growing faster in 2010-12 during the early stages of the recovery. \u201cMuch of the growth we have seen this year is not from tax cuts but from higher world energy prices spurring a boom in oil and gas drilling\u201d, says Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic Policy Research in Washington. \u201cIf we pull out energy-related sectors, the rise in investment would be even less.\u201d The growth boost from the tax cuts will gradually fade over the next 12-18 months just as higher interest rates really start to bite. To complete the picture, Trump\u2019s protectionist measures will also be a drag on US growth. In his book on the financial crisis and its aftermath*, Adam Tooze quotes a 2007 speech in which the then Fed chair Alan Greenspan said it did not matter how he voted in the 2008 presidential election. That was because the people of the US \u201cwere fortunate that, thanks to globalisation, policy decisions in the US have been largely replaced by global market forces. National security aside, it hardly makes any difference who will be the next president. The world is governed by market forces.\u201d Greenspan could no longer make that statement today. Trump framed the 2016 presidential election as the battle between an economic nationalist fighting for the little guy against the consummate establishment insider in hock to Wall Street. There was an air of complacency about Clinton\u2019s campaign that persisted right up to the moment of defeat. In office, Trump has challenged the idea that central banks always get things right; has made the case for more active use of fiscal policy and attacked the way in which globalisation is an elite racket. Although he is divisive and personally repugnant, there are progressives who support each of these policy stances. Yet, Trump will be judged on his record and for all his bragging, he has not presided over a revitalised American economy. Companies are using their tax windfalls to buy back shares rather than invest. The trade deficit is rising despite protectionism. Economic growth will peak this year, ease back in 2019 and slow further in 2020, by which time unemployment will be on the rise in the Rust Belt states that were promised a new beginning. If Trump gets his second term, it will only be because the Democrats prove as inept as they were in 2016. * Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World, Adam Tooze, published by Allen Lane",

      "bodyText": "Have the flames creeping around Marks &amp; Spencer abated or are they close to consuming the stalwart of the high street? During the summer, the chain\u2019s chairman, Archie Norman, said the business was \u201con a burning platform\u201d and that its future depended on whether it was able to change and develop. This week will bring an indication of what the future holds for the company. On Wednesday, it will release its half-year results, giving some idea of whether the turnaround plan is bearing fruit. The expectations are not positive, however, with speculation that the chain is going to present a \u201csubdued\u201d report of its recent performance. It has been a difficult year for M&amp;S. In May, the company announced a sharp fall in annual profits as a result of poor clothing sales; at the same time, the cost of extensive store closures mounted. Pretax profits slumped 62% to \u00a366.8m after a \u00a3514.1m bill for restructuring that included \u00a3321m to pay for the first phase of its store closure plan. One in three of its core clothing and home stores are scheduled to disappear within four years. The problems are ones that have beset many retailers which were once prominent features on the high street \u2013 the rise of the internet as a destination for shoppers, and moves towards cheaper options such as Primark, Aldi and Lidl. Shore Capital analysts have said they expected sales to be down by 1.5% in the announcement this week \u2013 including a drop in clothing sales \u2013 and profitability to decline, too. \u201cWith the group still working through step one, \u2018restoring the basics\u2019, of a multi-year restructuring/transformation programme, one that will touch all areas of the business, it should not be a surprise that we anticipate a relatively subdued overall financial performance year-on-year,\u201d it said. \u201cMuch heavy lifting is being undertaken behind the scenes to make M&amp;S a more fit-for-the-future organisation, though it remains too early to be reflected in the trading, operational or financial performance of the group.\u201d Analysts at Barclays also anticipate a fall in food and clothing sales and have said that they did not expect to see any decisive signs of improvement until next year. Santander forecasts sales down by 0.8% and has questioned whether the scale and speed of the restructuring has been enough to resolve the problems at the retailer. \u201cThe numbers will make interesting reading. However, it will, once again, be the strategic update and assessment that will drive share price momentum, in our view,\u201d said its guidance. Much focus on Wednesday will be on how M&amp;S is dealing with its challenges online. Over the summer, its chief executive, Steve Rowe, was particularly critical of the web operation \u2013 pages on its website took 50% longer to load than its slickest rivals, despite a \u00a3150m revamp, while its purpose-built warehouse at Castle Donington in Leicestershire could not support its ambition to have 30% of its clothing sales online in five years\u2019 time. \u201cMarks is belatedly making strides into online and digital retailing, including a new in-store payment app, and the market will be interested in what proportion of sales now come from those areas,\u201d said Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at the Share Centre. Whether those moves into e-commerce can quench the flames threatening M&amp;S remains to be seen.",

One in three of its core clothing and home stores are scheduled to disappear within four years.</p> <p>The problems are ones that have beset many retailers which were once prominent features on the high street \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/23/seven-reasons-why-marks-spencer-is-in-trouble\" title=\"\">rise of the internet</a> as a destination for shoppers, and moves towards cheaper options such as Primark, Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>Shore Capital analysts have said they expected sales to be down by 1.5% in the announcement this week \u2013 including a drop in clothing sales \u2013 and profitability to decline, too.</p> <p>\u201cWith the group still working through step one, \u2018restoring the basics\u2019, of a multi-year restructuring/transformation programme, one that will touch all areas of the business, it should not be a surprise that we anticipate a relatively subdued overall financial performance year-on-year,\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cMuch heavy lifting is being undertaken behind the scenes to make M&amp;S a more fit-for-the-future organisation, though it remains too early to be reflected in the trading, operational or financial performance of the group.\u201d</p> <p>Analysts at Barclays also anticipate a fall in food and clothing sales and have said that they did not expect to see any decisive signs of improvement until next year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Santander forecasts sales down by 0.8% and has questioned whether the scale and speed of the restructuring has been enough to resolve the problems at the retailer. \u201cThe numbers will make interesting reading.

Over the summer, its chief executive, Steve Rowe, was particularly critical of the web operation \u2013 pages on its website took 50% longer to load than its slickest rivals, despite a \u00a3150m revamp, while its purpose-built warehouse at Castle Donington in Leicestershire could not support its ambition to have 30% of its clothing sales online in five years\u2019 time.</p> <p>\u201cMarks is belatedly making strides into online and digital retailing, including a new in-store payment app, and the market will be interested in what proportion of sales now come from those areas,\u201d said Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at the Share Centre.</p> <p>Whether those moves into e-commerce can quench the flames threatening M&amp;S remains to be seen.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Almost everywhere I go, people ask me: \u201cWhere is David Cameron?\u201d I must admit that I occasionally bump into him. He gives a superficial impression of insouciance, but one hears on the grapevine that, privately, he regrets having called that referendum. Now we also hear that \u201cfriends\u201d of Cameron say he wishes at some stage to return to a cabinet job, although presumably not under Theresa May. Has he no shame? The people who ask me for Cameron\u2019s whereabouts are of course not remotely interested in them. They are furious that, having promised to stick it out whatever the outcome, he simply walked away. With a referendum aimed at resolving fissures over Europe within the Tory party having actually widened them, Cameron joined the shortlist of postwar PMs who have made truly catastrophic misjudgments. Two others who come readily to mind are Anthony Eden, who in 1956 led the nation into the Suez fiasco, and Tony Blair, who has not been forgiven for his role in supporting the disastrous US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. All living prime ministers who preceded Cameron \u2013 Sir John Major, Blair and Gordon Brown \u2013 are united in arguing that all potential versions of Brexit would damage this country economically \u2013 a point underlined in the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s economic and fiscal outlook last week, after whose publication the OBR\u2019s director, Robert Chote, poured buckets of cold water over Chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s wholly unconvincing claims of a Brexit dividend. The report itself observes that, even before Brexit, \u201cthe economy was 2% to 2.5% smaller by mid-2018 than it would have been if the referendum had not been called\u201d. In common with so many of us, these former PMs can hardly believe what is going on. It is tragic that Blair, who speaks and writes so convincingly about the follies of Brexit, carries so little credibility. By contrast Major, who for years bided his time about re-entering the public debate, has been spurred into action by the referendum, and by the manifest chaos that has ensued. In last week\u2019s London Evening Standard he argued that \u201cthe moral case for a second vote has never been more powerful\u201d. Major pointed out that: \u201cSince June 2016, there are now nearly 2 million more young people who are eligible to vote ... of those certain to vote, an astonishing 87% would opt to stay in the European Union.\u201d It is not uninteresting that the newspaper in which Major\u2019s article appeared has as its editor one George Osborne, who is also a passionate Remainer, and who was asleep at the wheel \u2013 as, I think, he now acknowledges \u2013 when not opposing strongly enough Cameron\u2019s decision to go ahead with the referendum. Osborne overdid the resolve he and Cameron had come to: Blair and Brown had been in continual conflict, as, in the latter stages of their professional relationship, had Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson; Cameron and Osborne were not going to be the same, alas. Osborne rightly regards the OBR\u2019s view that the British economy\u2019s underlying growth rate is, at 1.5% per annum (desperate by comparison with other advanced economies), \u201cone of the hidden costs of the uncertainty of Brexit\u201d. But, surprise, surprise, he does not add that it is also one of the not so hidden costs of the hugely damaging policy of austerity upon which he and Cameron embarked in 2010. In which context, I am reassured to note that most commentators have not been fooled by the claim that Philip Hammond\u2019s budget last week \u2013 a cynical attempt to ward off the \u201cBrexstremists\u201d within and without the cabinet \u2013 heralded an end to austerity. Unfortunately I fear that reports of the death of austerity have been much exaggerated. Just ask the London police: in the face of a serious crimewave, the traditional party of law and order offered them not a penny more in terms of extra resources. But back to Brexit, from which it is difficult to escape. I attended the People\u2019s Vote rally of 700,000 or so protesters the Saturday before last. I was much struck by Tory Remainer Sarah Wollaston\u2019s analogy: a patient may have signed an agreement for surgery to take place; but he or she should be at liberty to change their mind when confronted with new and more enlightening information. I think that is what is happening with regard to Brexit. The anti-Brexit demonstration should not be ignored. I bet that in his heart of hearts Tony Blair now wishes he had listened to the anti- Iraq protesters. If he had, people might be more inclined to listen to him now. But at least they should be listening to Sir John Major.",
