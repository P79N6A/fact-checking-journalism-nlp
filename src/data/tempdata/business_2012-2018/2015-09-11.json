      "bodyText": "The United Nations general assembly has approved a set of principles to resolve disputes between bankrupt countries and their creditors that the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis said would have \u201cavoided the pitfalls of the Greek crisis\u201d. The vote, with 136 supporting the scheme to six against, and 41 abstentions, comes after years of lobbying by Argentina and latterly Greece for a debt restructuring process to shield them from draconian cutbacks and reforms that threaten their political and economic stability. Argentina has battled a small group of hedge funds for several years that refused to join a deal agreed with more than 90% of creditors. A resolution is still awaited after an appeal to a New York court supported the hedge fund\u2019s demand for full repayment of $1.3bn (\u00a3842m). However those against the move included powerful creditor nations such as the US, Germany and the UK. Japan voted against the proposal, which was tabled by South Africa. The European Union as a whole abstained, despite a plea from Greece for it to join the broad coalition in favour. Ukraine and Iceland were among the countries that voted in favour of the principles, having previously abstained in September 2014. Greece, Ireland and Spain, which have also suffered from debt crises in recent years, joined the EU abstention. Unlike the security council, which has the power to issue legally binding resolutions, general assembly resolutions are non-binding. But anti-poverty campaign groups welcomed the vote, arguing that it carried significant political weight and paved the way for a fair and comprehensive set of guiding principles. Tim Jones, a policy officer for the Jubilee Debt Campaign, said: \u201cThis could prove to be a historic breakthrough. The vast majority of nations have spoken out for a change to the broken debt system. \u201cFrom the Greek debt debacle, to Argentina being held to ransom by vulture funds, to decades-old debt crises in Jamaica and El Salvador, the need for change has never been clearer. It is outrageous that the UK has chosen to put reckless lenders ahead of people around the world by voting against these principles.\u201d The resolution urges debtors and creditors \u201cto act in good faith and with a cooperative spirit to reach a consensual rearrangement\u201d on sovereign debt. \u201cA sovereign state has the right \u2026 to design its macroeconomic policy, including restructuring its sovereign debt, which should not be frustrated or impeded by any abusive measures,\u201d it added. The vote came one year and a day after the general assembly agreed to negotiate and adopt a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring. It added that states should be immune from domestic court decisions related to sovereign debt restructuring, adding that any exceptions should be limited. The resolution also says debt restructuring should lead to a stable situation that preserves creditors\u2019 rights while supporting economic growth. The US, UK and EU made it clear that they had voted against to preserve the International Monetary Fund as the final arbiter of sovereign debt resolutions in its role as lender of last resort. They added that a statutory mechanism for debt restructurings would sow uncertainty in financial markets. A US delegate told the assembly the resolution\u2019s language was \u201cproblematic\u201d and that countries do not have any \u201csovereign right\u201d to debt restructuring. The delegate added that the UN was not the appropriate venue for such issues. Argentina welcomed the adoption of the resolution. Its foreign minister, H\u00e9ctor Timerman, told the assembly: \u201cIt is a resolution in favour of economic stability, social peace and development. Today, debt is a cause of violence, of inequality, of situations whereby the powerful take advantage of less developed countries needing funds.\u201d Argentina has long supported UN action on debt restructuring principles. It defaulted on $100bn (\u00a365bn) in bonds in a 2002 crisis that thrust millions of middle-class Argentinians into poverty. That crisis is still plaguing the country\u2019s finances. Top Argentinian officials regularly blast bondholders who have sued the country over the debt it failed to pay 13 years ago. Argentina defaulted again last year when a US judge barred it from honouring its restructured debt without reaching a deal with the funds, which the president has denounced as \u201cvultures\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The price of oil could more than halve again, to just $20 (\u00a313) a barrel, experts at Goldman Sachs are predicting, a shift which would spell big savings for motorists but cast doubt on the viability of North Sea oilfields. Homeowners, motorists and many industries would gain although a further price collapse could prompt thousands more job losses in the struggling North Sea sector and could eventually hit Treasury tax revenues. The value of the benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude has already fallen from $107 last June to less than $44 but analysts at Goldman Sachs forecast another huge plunge in WTI. It last traded at $20 a barrel in 2002. \u201cThe oil market is even more oversupplied than we had expected and we now forecast this surplus to persist in 2016 \u2026 the potential for oil prices to fall to such levels, which we estimate near $20/bbl, is becoming greater\u201d, the US investment bank said in a research note. Chris Williamson, the chief economist at financial services provider Markit, said a further fall in energy costs could only be a net positive for the UK economy. \u201cIt would be hugely beneficial to households as lower petrol and fuel costs would leave more money to spend on other nicer things. It would also bring down inflation and keep interest rates lower for longer which would help homeowners with mortgages. But it will be of huge concern to our offshore oil industry.\u201d The trigger for the original energy price collapse which started last summer was a realisation that new oil production, particularly from new US shale wells and Iraq, was expanding much faster than expected. At the same time an expected strong rise in demand on the back of global economic growth has failed to materialise due to faltering performance by key countries such as China. The Opec cartel of Middle East oil producers has traditionally tried to balance the market by reducing output in time of low oil prices but this time it has chosen to try to drive its US shale rivals out of business, something that it has so far failed to do. The fall in oil prices has partly been passed on to the petrol forecourt where diesel can cost 112p per litre \u2013 the lowest level in five years \u2013 and unleaded petrol 114p. A year ago motorists were paying 133p for diesel and for 129p for unleaded petrol. It has also helped drive down the cost of gas, which heats many homes, because many major gas contracts are tied to the price of oil. Goldman admits the $20 level is a worst-case scenario and it has been wrong in the past by predicting $200 oil. But other banks are also cutting their price expectations for this year and next. Meanwhile the International Energy Agency said output cuts had started around the world which would eventually drive up prices again. In its latest monthly report out on Friday the Paris-based organisation said: \u201cOil\u2019s price collapse is closing down high-cost production from Eagle Ford in Texas to Russia and the North Sea.\u201d Aberdeen, the centre of the UK offshore oil industry, has already seen a dramatic slump in drilling levels and thousands of job cuts as oil companies cut their budgets in line with the collapse in crude prices. The annual economic report for Oil &amp; Gas UK disclosed on Wednesday that the total number of people employed in the sector had fallen from 440,000 to 375,000 since the beginning of 2014. The lobby group said many oilfields were now operating at a loss and predicted more redundancies were likely. The collapse of prices make oil companies reluctant to commit to new fields, something that would undermine the Scottish National party\u2019s hopes of funding future public spending on an expansion of North Sea oil. Falling fossil fuel prices will also be potentially be bad for climate change as it can lead to higher usage and CO2 production while undermining the competitiveness of rival renewable energy technologies.",

Banks such as Metro and Secure Trust met Treasury officials on Friday amid continued controversy about the new tax introduced in July\u2019s budget. Banks will be required to pay an extra 8% of corporation tax on profits of more than \u00a325m from next year, following a decision by George Osborne to water down the bank levy which is calculated on the size of balance sheets rather than profits. There are concerns that the 8% surcharge could stifle competition as it will leave smaller banks with a higher tax bill, while the big banks with an international presence such as HSBC are expected to be pay less overall because of the cut to the bank levy. Analysts have calculated that HSBC and Standard Chartered will pay an estimated \u00a31bn less in tax a result of the changes which were announced at a time when HSBC had said publicly it was considering whether to keep its headquarters in the UK. Paul Lynam, chief executive of Secure Trust and chair of the British Bankers\u2019 Association\u2019s challenger bank panel, said: \u201cWe are not willing let to let this drop and think it\u2019s hugely important to the UK economy.\u201d No further meetings have been scheduled between the smaller banks and Treasury officials, although they are thought to have agreed to consider whether the new tax could have a tiered structure.

The finance bill, which implemented the tax measures, has passed through parliament without any changes. The government has said it wants to encourage competition in the banking sector to break the dominance of the big four of HSBC, Barclays, and bailed out banks Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a closing summary. Oil prices have declined after Goldman Sachs suggested that prices could fall as low as $20 because of a global glut of crude. Investors ignored a report from the International Energy Agency that said supply was tightening, as expensive oil producers left the market, in an apparent win for the Opec cartel. Germany\u2019s finance minister has stepped up warnings that economies cannot rely on central banks alone and must undertake difficult structural reforms. Although he didn\u2019t mention the European Central Bank and its \u20ac1 trillion bond-buying programme, most people knew the bank he had in mind. Meanwhile a senior ECB policymaker warned that the eurozone was still not creating enough jobs. Greek politicians traded ideas ahead of (yet more) critical elections on 20 September. The leader of the centre-right New Democracy party said he could work with leftist Syriza. But the head of Syriza, Alexis Tsipras, ruled out a grand coalition, as his party rebounded in the polls. In the UK, housebuilding slipped to its slowest rate in two years, doing nothing to abate anxiety about sky-high house prices. US markets have opened lower, following the lead of Europe. The Nasdaq is down 0.52%, the Dow Jones is down 0.25%, while the S&amp;P 500 has slipped 0.29%. The FTSE100 is currently down 0.6% on the day at 6,120 points, defying earlier optimistic expectations. The German DAX is off 0.4%. That\u2019s all from me. The Guardian business live blog will be back on Monday. Thank you for following and have a good weekend. Over in Greece former prime minister Alexis Tsipras has derided any suggestion of his entering a \u2018grand coalition\u2019 as propaganda, Guardian correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens. With a mere nine days left before Greeks go to the polls, Alexis Tsipras has ratcheted up the rhetoric, emphatically ruling out forming any coalition with the centre right New Democracy. Speaking to supporters in the north western city of Ioannina, the Syriza leader denounced the very idea as \u201cpropaganda\u201d \u2013 propaganda he said was being deliberately promulgated by Brussels which wanted to see the conservatives back in power. Referring to New Democracy\u2019s leader, he told the crowd: What they are saying is that they won\u2019t restructure out debt if we don\u2019t embrace [Vangelis] Meimarakis. The former prime minister, who has been campaigning on a platform that only the left can bring real change to Greece by ousting the old establishment, said the 63-year-old Meimarakis represented everything that was rotten with Greece. He himself and his party are not only representatives of the most conservative lobby in Europe but representatives of regression, of the old, of decay, of corruption and scandals. Since Tsipras\u2019 surprise move to call the snap polls last month, Meimarakis has played up the need for consensus politics, saying he would be more than willing to enter a power-sharing arrangement with the leftists to meet the challenges that lie ahead enforcing the country\u2019s third bailout. The approach appears to have paid off with New Democracy rebounding in the polls. But today Syriza, for the first time, was shown to have a substantial lead over the conservative party with a nationwide survey produced by Pro Rata putting support for the two parties at 28.5 % and 23.5 % respectively. China no longer has such powerful economic leverage over the United States, according to analysis by Bloomberg business. Bloomberg has put together four charts showing how China has a weaker hand over the US, ahead of President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to Washington in October. As the first shows, China is on course to become the US\u2019s largest trading partner, making it increasingly dependent on American consumers. So Xi needs to ensure that America remains a happy customer, while President Barack Obama can rest easier from a trade standpoint, given that U.S. exports to China are a proportionally much smaller slice of the U.S. economy. You can read the full article here. US producer prices were flat in August, pointing to benign inflation pressures that could weigh on the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision whether to hike interest rates next week, reports Reuters from Washington. It continues The unchanged reading in the producer price index last month followed a 0.2% gain in July, the Labor Department said on Friday. The drag on producer prices from lower crude oil prices and a strong dollar was offset by an increase in profit margins for apparel, footwear and accessories retailing. In the 12 months through August, the PPI fell 0.8% after a similar decline in July. It was the seventh straight 12-month decrease in the index. Tame inflation adds to the dilemma for the US Federal Reserve, who are contemplating raising rates for the first time in nearly a decade. This is the first image of Robert De Niro playing Bernie Madoff, the fraudster who cheated investors out of $65bn in the world\u2019s biggest ponzi scheme. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Ruth Madoff in the HBO film Wizard of Lies. And here is the original... What has Shakespeare\u2019s comedy Much Ado about Nothing got to do with exchange rates? To find the answer you will have to read this speech* by Kristin Forbes, a member of the bank\u2019s monetary policy-setting committee. The American economist said that the Bank may have to raise interest rates sooner than its models suggest, if the strong pound has a weaker impact on inflation than previously thought. My comments propose a new approach that puts more emphasis on the underlying reasons why the exchange rate moves. Most economists have a \u201csurprisingly poor understanding\u201d of exactly how exchange rate movements affect inflation, she said. Here are three main points First, contrary to common belief, exchange rate movements don\u2019t seem to consistently have larger effects on prices in sectors with a higher share of imported content. Second, exchange rates don\u2019t seem to consistently have larger effects on prices in the most tradable and internationally-competitive sectors. Third, the effects of exchange rates on inflation \u2013 and even just on import prices \u2013 do not seem to be consistent across time. Most of what I learned in grad school on this topic no longer seems to apply. And the Shakespeare connection? In Shakespeare\u2019s play \u201cMuch Ado about Nothing\u201d, the word \u201cnothing\u201d was not only a reference to the tremendous fuss made about events which should have had no import, but also a play on the terms \u201cnoting\u201d or \u201cnoticing\u201d (which were pronounced as \u201cnothing\u201d in old English).... ...This insight on the importance of \u201cnoting\u201d is also critically important when analysing how exchange rate movements affect inflation \u2013 and therefore monetary policy. So there you have it. Another group of analysts have put a red line through their oil price forecasts. This time it is Commerzbank that is lowering its forecast: the German bank is expecting the average price of Brent crude to be $56 in 2015 and $62 in 2016. West Texas Intermediate, the other global benchmark, is forecast at $51 a barrel in 2015 and $59 in 2016. The bank said: The oversupply of crude oil is only dwindling slowly and is likely to depress oil prices until far into next year. The former boss of Standard Chartered, Peter Sands, could become an informal adviser to the British government, reports the Financial Times (\u00a3). A Number 10 source said no formal appointment had been made, but according to the FT: It is understood that the role is informal and unpaid, and that Mr Sands will not have a direct role in regulation of the financial industry. Peter Sands, stood down from Standard Chartered in the summer, with mixed views on his record. Although Standard Chartered emerged from the financial crisis in better shape than any of its UK competitors, in the past three years it has suffered falling profits and been fined by the US authorities for infringing sanctions against Iran. Goldman Sachs think there is an outside chance that oil could fall to $20 a barrel. But the Economist Intelligence Unit is forecasting a small price rise for oil in 2016. Meanwhile Russia\u2019s central bank is counting on an average price of $50 over the next three years. Wanted: bank regulators. Economic training essential, languages desirable. Helpful to know the difference between the BRRD and the CRR/CRD. Remuneration: competitive, but don\u2019t expect to earn a British banker\u2019s salary. The European Central Bank is recruiting 230 staff to its bank watchdog division, increasing headcount by a fifth. Reuters has the story: The hiring plan underscores the ECB\u2019s ambition to get to grips with an industry that triggered a financial crisis, hammering national finances and even threatening the euro currency. The ECB has already carried out stress tests of top banks across the 19 countries in the euro zone and wants to delve deeper into their businesses to uncover further hidden risks. \u201cThe plan is to add about 230 staff,\u201d the person said. The extra people, two thirds of whom will be hired next year with the remainder in 2017, comes as the supervisory agency takes more banks under its watch. The latest fall in output in the UK construction industry ( see 09.32) is seen as bad news by analysts. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS, concludes that the \u201cdisappointing news\u201d on the construction sector adds to signs that the economy is seeing \u201ca softer third quarter\u201d. Of course, the data could be adjusted... Admittedly, construction output can be highly volatile from month to month... But all the same... The 2.7% month-on-month drop in housebuilding in July coupled with a 2.4% quarter-on-quarter drop in new orders for housebuilding in the second quarter is particularly disappointing news for the government which is currently prioritising the sector to deal with the UK\u2019s serious housing shortage \u2013 and many more houses need to be built. Michael Thirkettle, chief executive of construction and property consultancy McBains Cooper, also described the fall in construction output as worrying news. There is a chronic housing shortage and although we welcome government plans to build 200,000 new homes by 2020, there is no chance of that number being built unless desperate skills shortages in the industry are addressed. The head of JD Weatherspoon is only the latest business leader to criticise the government\u2019s decision to increase the minimum wage. Tim Martin\u2019s attack on the so-called \u2018National Living Wage\u2019 follows complaints from the association of convenience stores, carehome employers and the CBI. In view of these responses, the Daily Telegraph has an interesting comment piece by Jeremy Warner, who describes himself as someone \u201cwho broadly believes in as little government as possible\u201d. He argues that the government has a powerful macroeconomic case for what it is doing. The over-arching reason can, however, be expressed in a single word \u2013 globalisation. One of the effects has been substantially to depress, through migration and emerging market competition, the costs of labour. This has not been a happy experience for advanced economies, many of which have attempted to keep the natives happy by force feeding them with debt. As we have learned, debt makes a poor, and potentially highly toxic, substitute, giving the illusion of rising living standards but not the substance. He goes on to say that \u201cthe relatively low minimum wage\u201d introduced by Labour, put little pressure on employers to pay more Too often, cheap labour is used as a lazy alternative to productivity enhancing capital spending. A much higher minimum wage might shift the balance by better aligning the incentives for investment. The full article is well worth reading. Further reading: Next boss serves up some sober analysis of wage policy Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has warned against over reliance on central bank money at the expense of difficult economic reforms. It should not serve as a way out of, or to neglect, what is necessary -- that is structural reforms. Reuters has a summary: Sch\u00e4uble avoided any mention of the European Central Bank, but he has repeatedly warned against an excessive reliance on central bank stimulus at a time when the ECB is paving the way to expand its already massive 1 trillion-euro asset-buying plan. Last week, the ECB cut its growth and inflation forecasts and the bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, said explicitly the bond-buying programme may run beyond September 2016 and the bank may adjust its size and composition. \u201cWe should take on board the lessons of the last crisis,\u201d Schaeuble told the Atlantik-Bruecke association in Berlin, which aims to promote friendship between Germany and the United States. Earlier this week, Sch\u00e4uble hit out at his critics, claiming he was \u201cthe better Keynesian\u201d. The governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney has said interest rates will go up and it seems people are getting the message. According to the latest Bank survey on public expectations around inflation, 46% of the population expect a rate rise over the next year, compared to only 33% in May. The bank said this was highest level of expectation about a rate hike since May 2011. The UK has been put on notice to expect a rate rise around the turn of the year, bringing an end to a long period when rates have been lodged at 0.5%. The survey also showed that public perceptions of inflation were out of tune with official statistics. The average person thinks that inflation is around 2.1%, although the official consumer price index for July stood at just 0.1%. Just as analysts at Goldman Sachs predict the world could see a $20 barrel of oil because of oversupply, another set of energy experts have concluded that producers of expensive crude are beginning to cut production in response to the price collapse. Oil that is expensive to produce is being driven out of the market according to the latest oil market report from the International Energy Agency. This means the strategy of the Opec oil cartel of not reducing supply in order to defend their market share, appears to be working, the IEA concludes. Oil\u2019s price collapse is closing down high-cost production from Eagle Ford in Texas to Russia and the North Sea. But so far investors are paying more attention to Goldman Sachs\u2019 bearish predictions: Brent crude has continued its fall and is currently trading at around $47.87. There isn\u2019t much cheer for anyone looking for relief from sky-high house prices in London and the south east of England. Housebuilding in the UK saw its biggest annual fall in more than two years, according to the latest data from the Office for National statistics. Here are some of the details: In July 2015, output in the construction industry decreased by 1% on the previous month, after increasing by 0.9% in June. All new work decreased by 1.5% while repair and maintenance showed no growth. Public new housing, private new housing, public other new work and private commercial work decreased by 5.8%, 2.0%, 4.5% and 2.9% respectively. Michael Dall from the Barbour ABI consultancy blamed the general election for leaving developers in an uncertain mood. Construction new orders dipped slightly overall in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the previous quarter and this was primarily driven by a decline in new private housing orders and private commercial orders. A general slowdown in contract award activity in the housing sector can be attributed in part to the uncertainty surrounding the UK General Election where developers adopted a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach for new schemes. So is this just a temporary blip? Dall is forecasting \u201ca positive outlook for the construction industry over the near term\u201d. Breaking news: UK construction output declined in July, as a result of a fall in housebuilding. How low could oil prices go? Much lower, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs, who suggest oil could slide to just $20 a barrel. Goldman analysts said: The oil market is even more oversupplied than we had expected and we now forecast this surplus to persist in 2016 on further OPEC production growth, resilient non-OPEC supply and slowing demand growth, with risks skewed to even weaker demand given China\u2019s slowdown and its negative EM feedback loop... While not our base case, the potential for oil prices to fall to such levels, which we estimate near $20/bbl, is becoming greater as storage continues to fill. As Fast FT points out, Goldman Sachs once predicted that oil prices would touch $200 a barrel by 2010. A barrel of Brent crude is currently changing hands for $48.27, a 1.27% fall in today\u2019s trading session, but still above recent lows. Goldman is forecasting that Brent will remain under pressure: it expects prices to be $49.50 in 2016, down from earlier forecasts of $62. Goldman cut its 2016 estimate for West Texas Intermediate oil to $45 a barrel from an earlier projection of $57. In their latest report, the bank writes: Operational stress is a growing downside risk to our forecast. This further creates the risk that a slowdown in production takes place too gradually forcing oil markets to clear as they historically have, through a collapse to production costs once the surplus breaches logistical and storage capacity. While not our base case, the potential for oil prices to fall to such levels, which we estimate near $20/bbl, is becoming greater as storage continues to fill. Sources: Fast FT, Bloomberg and UK Business Insider Greece\u2019s elections later this month raise the intriguing possibility of a coalition between the traditional conservative party New Democracy and leftist former governing party Syriza. Opinion polls have put Syriza and New Democracy neck and neck \u2013 far from the easy victory Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras imagined when he called the election to shore up support for the controversial bailout agreement. In an interview with Reuters New Democracy leader Vangelis Meimarakis said he is ready to work with Syriza, if his party finishes in first place. But he would turn to other European parties if Syriza rejected a coalition. This is the country\u2019s last chance...I am mature. I\u2019m ready, with a plan, with the party\u2019s top brass and a united parliamentary group, to pull the country out of the crisis. But Tsipras will be hoping that he gets to choose his coalition partner -and a poll published today puts Syriza ahead. Economic growth in the euro zone is still too weak to create enough jobs, according to a senior figure at the European Central Bank. Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, a member of the bank\u2019s executive board, told French newspaper group EBRA on Friday that growth was not sufficient for job creation. He said: Growth is still not strong enough to create a sufficient number of jobs. Europe will first have to demonstrate its usefulness by creating more growth and more jobs. He also gave a defence of the latest Greek bailout deal, saying that it struck a balance between two legitimate concerns \u2013 the mandate of then Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and taxpayers in other eurozone countries. And there was a hint of more breathing room in the programme, as long as Greece is meeting the main objectives of its creditors. The important thing is that Greece and its partners trust each other again. On this basis, there will be room for manoeuvre when it comes to adapting the programme after the elections, for example in terms of labour market reforms and tackling vested interests, provided that the objectives of the programme are met. The full interview can be read in its original French and English on the European Central Bank\u2019s website. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. European stocks are set to make their biggest weekly gain since July, amid ongoing volatility on global markets. Some stock markets in Asia rose on Friday, amid fleeting hopes that the Federal Reserve will delay an interest-rate rise when it meets next week. The MSCI broad index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was only up about 0.2% today, but is still on course to have gained 3% this week. Japan\u2019s Nikkei index closed down 0.2%, but was still up on the week by 2.6%. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 is up 1.6% so far this week and is expected to make its biggest weekly gain since July, despite chalking up a loss on Thursday. Also on our agenda: at 9.30 BST we will get the latest output figures for the UK construction industry and the Bank of England\u2019s regular attitudes to inflation report. At 12.30 BoE policymaker Kristin Forbes is due to speak at the Macro and Finance Research Group\u2019s annual conference in Cardiff. I will be following those events and all the latest economic news.",

This further creates the risk that a slowdown in production takes place too gradually forcing oil markets to clear as they historically have, through a collapse to production costs once the surplus breaches logistical and storage capacity. <strong>While not our base case, the potential for oil prices to fall to such levels, which we estimate near $20/bbl, is becoming greater as storage continues to fill.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Sources: <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/fastft/390471\">Fast FT</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-11/-20-oil-possible-for-goldman-as-forecasts-cut-on-growing-glut\">Bloomberg</a> and <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-huge-supply-and-weak-demand-could-send-oil-prices-plunging-to-20-per-barrel-2015-9\">UK Business Insider</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-09-11T08:15:45.706Z\">at 9.15am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55f27f76e4b0f3f3043af4a4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-11T07:28:40.492Z\">8.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Greece\u2019s elections later this month raise the intriguing possibility of a coalition between the traditional conservative party New Democracy and leftist former governing party Syriza.</p> <p>Opinion polls have put Syriza and New Democracy neck and neck \u2013 far from the easy victory Syriza leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/alexis-tsipras\">Alexis Tsipras</a> imagined when he called the election to shore up support for the controversial bailout agreement.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/10/us-eurozone-greece-election-conservative-idUSKCN0RA29X20150910\">an interview with Reuters</a> New Democracy leader Vangelis Meimarakis said he is ready to work with Syriza, if his party finishes in first place.

Kristin Forbes, one of the nine rate-setting members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, questioned whether current economic models were accurately reflecting the relationship, or \u201cpass-through\u201d, between exchange rates and the outlook for inflation. That, in turn, had important implications for monetary policy, she said in a speech. \u201cThis limited understanding of how exchange rate movements affect inflation is \u2013 to be candid \u2013 quite frustrating for those of us tasked to set monetary policy. This is a crucial relationship \u2013 especially for an open economy such as the UK,\u201d Forbes told the Money Macroeconomics and Finance research group conference in Cardiff. The stronger pound has cut the price of UK imports and is seen as a key factor in keeping inflation hovering around zero in recent months. With inflation well below the Bank\u2019s government-set target of 2%, financial markets are not expecting interest rates to rise until next year. However, Forbes suggested economists wanting to gauge the implications of currency moves for inflation needed to place more weight on the underlying causes of exchange rate movements. Based on her analysis of recent factors behind the relatively strong pound, its downward effect on inflation seemed more muted than in the past, said Forbes, a US economics professor. \u201cPerhaps most important for monetary policy today, this approach also suggests that sterling\u2019s recent appreciation could create less drag on import prices and inflation than we might have expected if the levels of pass-through seen after the crisis persisted,\u201d she said. \u201cIf this plays out, monetary policy would need to be tightened sooner than based on the older models.\u201d At the the latest monetary policy committee meeting this week, Forbes voted along with seven other members to keep interest rates at 0.5%. Only one policymaker, Ian McCafferty, thought now was the time to start raising borrowing costs after more than six years at a record low. Forbes suggested central banks need to look again at how they factor in currency movements and that in the UK\u2019s case, the pound\u2019s strength should not necessarily delay a rate rise. She laid out what she considered to be three misunderstandings around exchange rates and inflation. Forbes argued that \u201ccontrary to common belief, exchange rate movements don\u2019t seem to consistently have larger effects on prices in sectors with a higher share of imported content\u201d. Second, exchange rates do not seem to consistently have larger effects on prices in the most tradable and internationally competitive sectors. Third, the effects of exchange rates on inflation \u2013 and even just on import prices \u2013 \u201cdo not seem to be consistent across time\u201d.",
