Fair comment. The National Audit Office reached a similar damning conclusion in April. To the list, we could add gross naivety, displayed in at least three ways. First, it was madness for the government to sell 60% of Royal Mail in one go. The business was fundamentally hard to value. Royal Mail had just started to reap the benefits of a softer regulatory regime on the price of stamps. Its cost of borrowing would fall steeply after privatisation because the company would escape the harsh terms on which the government was lending. The freehold property portfolio was a mish-mash of sites with disputed values. And Royal Mail's dividend-paying power \u2013 the chief valuation yardstick for a semi-utility - had been transformed by the removal of the historic pension fund liability. No wonder, then, that the investment banks, when pitching to act as bookrunners and advisers to the float, put wildly different estimates on Royal Mail's worth. The spread in valuation ran to several billions of pounds. In the circumstances, the best pragmatic policy would have been to sell, say, 25% of Royal Mail initially and let the market establish its view of fair value. Then the bulk of the state's shares could have been off-loaded when the market price had been given time to settle. Second, having locked themselves into selling 60%, ministers failed to give themselves flexibility on pricing. The top of the price range was capped at 330p \u2013 the eventual float price \u2013 regardless of the strength of demand for shares. Cable, Fallon and government adviser Lazard have argued repeatedly that demand for shares would have evaporated above 330p but the evidence for this is thin to non-existent. As the select committee's report says, institutional investors had no incentive to declare an interest above 330p. \"The fact that many long-term investors bought shares later at a far higher price is evidence to us that there was demand for Royal Mail shares at a higher price,\" says the report. Quite. Third, Cable's concern to endow Royal Mail with a core of \"long-term investors\" who would stick around to support management's restructuring plans was a bad case of honourable intentions falling down in the face of market realities. If a quick 50% profit is available, the definition of long-term is about five minutes for most institutional investors. In any case, some of the selections of \"long-term\" investors were simply eccentric. Och-Ziff is a New York hedge fund famous for funding Malcolm Glazer's highly leveraged buyout of Manchester United. As Royal Mail's shares soared to 455p on day one, and then climbed above 500p, most \"cornerstone\" investors inevitably banked a big profit. They were entitled to do so because priority access to shares required no commitment to stay on the register. So what was the point of the exercise? The government merely forfeited pricing power. Cable, finally accepting that he is persuading nobody with his breezy insistence that the sale of Royal Mail was somehow a triumph for taxpayers, has appointed Lord Myners to conduct a review of how the state handles privatisations.

    "webTitle": "Royal Mail sale underpriced by \u00a31bn, says scathing select committee report", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Taxpayers lost out on \u00a31bn because the government and its City advisers underpriced the privatisation of Royal Mail, a committee of MPs says today. In a highly critical report, the Business, Innovation and Skills (Bis) committee said the government worried too much about pushing the privatisation through at the expense of getting the best price for taxpayers. Royal Mail was privatised in October when the government sold 60% of its stake at 330p a share, valuing the company at \u00a33.3bn. On their first day of trading, the shares jumped by 38% \u2013 far higher than normal for a flotation \u2013 and continued to rise after that. They hit a high of 615p on 15 January and closed at 474p on Thursday, valuing Royal Mail at \u00a31.4bn more than the sale price. In evidence to the committee, Vince Cable, the business secretary, and his minister Michael Fallon defended the sale price by saying the risk of a nationwide strike hung over Royal Mail during the privatisation, making investors wary about the company's prospects. Royal Mail and the Communication Workers' Union (CWU) settled their long-running dispute soon after the flotation in an agreement that promised a new era of industrial harmony. Cable dismissed the post-privatisation rise in Royal Mail's share price at the time as \"froth\" that would settle once the market had judged the company's value. The committee criticised Cable for not defining froth properly and for stretching the period he had in mind from the \"immediate aftermath\" of the flotation to months or years later. Adrian Bailey, chairman of the committee, said: \"It's not at all clear that the government's sale of Royal Mail has brought an adequate and appropriate return for taxpayers. The government cannot blithely dismiss as 'froth' our committee's concern that the low issue price of this prime public asset has cost the taxpayer around a billion pounds.\" Cable's department said the privatisation raised \u00a32bn for taxpayers and put Royal Mail on a secure footing as a publicly traded company able to raise capital from the market. It said the report ignored the size of the share sale and included factual errors. The department said: \"The committee's views on the share price are based entirely on hindsight and ignore that we were selling 600m shares \u2013 they found no evidence that the department or its advisers missed vital information prior to sale. The share price remains very volatile to this day, as the business secretary told the committee, and has dropped 25% from its high point.\" The National Audit Office (NAO) has criticised Cable for refusing to increase Royal Mail's flotation price despite widespread fears the 500-year-old company was being sold on the cheap. He has refused to apologise and still describes the privatisation as a success. But on Wednesday, with the committee's report looming, Cable announced a review of the privatisation process, headed by Lord Myners, a City veteran and minister in the last government. The MPs were also scathing about the role of Cable's investment banking advisers \u2013 Lazard, Goldman Sachs and UBS \u2013 as well as the shareholder executive, the government team that works on privatisations. In evidence to the committee, the advisers insisted they had got the best deal possible, despite admitting they had considered recommending the government to seek a higher price from investors. The advisers' work on the privatisation was \"not up to standard\" and did not get the best deal for taxpayers, the MPs said. The report, backed unanimously by MPs from the three major parties, criticised Cable's attempts to secure long-term investors for Royal Mail by giving preferred status to certain fund managers. They singled out Cable's unwillingness to publish the list of investors until the day before he appeared at the committee and called for more information about those that had sold their stakes. The government also ignored NAO recommendations about the treatment of three large London sites included in the sale. The NAO argued for their exclusion from the sale or for provisions for the government to get money back from their later sale. After the privatisation, the NAO said the government's \u00a3200m valuation of the sites underestimated their worth. Bailey said: \"This was the most significant privatisation in years. We believe that fear of failure and poor quality advice led to a significant underestimate of the demand for Royal Mail shares. The government's inclusion of Royal Mail's 'surplus' assets in the sell-off, without the prospect of clawing back future proceeds, may also mean the taxpayer losing out once again.\" Billy Hayes, general secretary of the CWU, which opposed privatisation, said: \"The Bis select committee's damning report published today shows the extent of the government's incompetence in the privatisation of Royal Mail. The only froth came from Vince Cable and Michael Fallon's allegations that threat of strike action from the CWU last summer affected the share price.\" The committee accepted that the government succeeded in privatising Royal Mail in this parliament and giving employees a stake in the business but said it failed to achieve its third aim of securing value for money.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco has raided Marks &amp; Spencer for its new finance director, Alan Stewart, who will join the supermarket with a \u00a31.7m golden hello. Stewart, who has been at M&amp;S for four years, will replace Laurie McIlwee, who resigned in April after a tumultuous period in charge of Tesco's finances that included its first profit warning in more than 20 years. Stewart, who also held the finance job at WH Smith, brings some much-needed retail experience to the Tesco board, which has been denuded by a string of senior departures. In April, Tesco reported a second year of falling group profits. The chief executive, Philip Clarke, is under growing pressure to arrest falling UK market share as shoppers defect to cheaper rivals such as Aldi and Lidl. Clarke has promised \u00a3200m of price cuts this year and is pushing through a store refurbishment programme. Stewart's departure is a blow to M&amp;S, which is also in the midst of a turnaround. He was lured to Tesco with a generous pay deal that will lift his basic salary from \u00a3579,000 at M&amp;S to \u00a3750,000. He is being granted replacement share awards worth \u00a31.7m in lieu of deferred share awards he will forfeit when he leaves M&amp;S. Tesco said two other performance-related awards were being taken into account but declined to give further details. Stewart's total remuneration package will be disclosed in the 2015 annual report. The largesse of the deal comes despite the fact that M&amp;S's recent poor results have meant that performance-related share awards have not paid out. Tesco and M&amp;S are yet to agree on the terms of Stewart's gardening leave but his start date could be six months away due to a non-compete clause in his M&amp;S contract. Clarke said: \"We wanted a candidate who had the right blend of experience, leadership and values to play a leading role in the transformation of Tesco. We have found all three in Alan. I am looking forward to working alongside him and I know Tesco will benefit from the breadth and depth of his experience.\" McIlwee quit Tesco after months of speculation about his future and amid reports of disagreements with Clarke over strategy. He had a tense relationship with the City, with some analysts critical of his financial forecasts. This year's annual report revealed that McIlwee, who has been given the title CFO emeritus, will collect a golden goodbye of almost \u00a31m when he departs in October. He earned a salary of \u00a3886,420. The Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said Stewart's move was a surprise. \"For Tesco, I sense that it is a sound move. Alan is a solid man, albeit M&amp;S has singularly failed to meet the guidance that he has presented to the market. Tesco represents another step for him. \"That said, the problems of M&amp;S and Tesco revolve around more fundamental matters than the CFO.\" Stewart, who started his career in investment banking with HSBC, became Thomas Cook's chief financial officer in 1998; three years later was appointed the UK chief executive. From there he moved to WH Smith as group finance director where he worked alongside Kate Swann to improve the company's performance. He left in 2008 to join aircraft leasing business AWAS. Tesco said of Stewart's share awards: \"The value of the shares which replace those he will forfeit was independently calculated based on current market forecasts for the future performance of M&amp;S and the corresponding level of payout for each award. The most recent awards, due to pay out in three years, are subject to a clawback.\"",

In principle this means the government's ability to access the \u20ac6.4 billion will be dependent upon some degree of private sector burden sharing, certainly capturing shareholders and junior creditors </p> <p>In a scenario in which the government is forced to step in, which could be decided as early as today, the most likely outcome is that BES will be saved and isolated from other parts of the ESFG conglomerate, which would in turn fail. However even here, retail customers who invested in ESFG's commercial paper will be covered, as the Bank of Portugal forced the group to build a special provision of \u20ac700 million to deal with such circumstances.</p> <p>Blowback for the sovereign will also likely be limited. Not only are the likely holes to be covered small and manageable, but the government does also not need to tap capital markets anytime soon.

In return, successive governments have had to enact tough austerity measures, such as cutting spending and reforming the economy.</p> <p>Portugal's efforts in recent years to get its public finances into shape have helped it regain the trust of investors. That was manifested in the fall in the interest rates the country pays on its borrowings.

      "bodyText": "OK, that all for tonight. Rolling coverage of the market wobbles starts at 1pm, with plenty of analysis and reaction. And here's our news story about the Espirito Santo situation: Portuguese bank fears hit stock markets The other big news of the day was: The worrying decline in manufacturing output in Europe's major economies in May, starting with France.....and followed by Italy and the Netherlands Britain's trade gap widened again, partly due to weak exports to Europe. And we also saw anti-austerity protests in Lisbon. While in Greece, another Golden Dawn MP was imprisoned ahead of a trial. Oh, and the Bank of England didn't do anything to dampen rumours that it's forgotten how to raise interest rates..... The blog will be back tomorrow..... goodnight. GW Antonio Roldan, analyst at Eurasia Group, reckons Banco Espirito will not destabilise Portugal's own financial position. He points out that Lisbon can still access \u20ac6.4bn of unused funds that were earmarked for bank recapitalizations, but private bondholders might have to take a hit too: The government had been intending to use this money as a backstop for its banks in the context of the ongoing Asset Quality Reviews, which will culminate in October.... Importantly, access to public funds to shore up BES (or, indeed, any bank in the Eurozone) will now be subject to EU state aid rules. In principle this means the government's ability to access the \u20ac6.4 billion will be dependent upon some degree of private sector burden sharing, certainly capturing shareholders and junior creditors In a scenario in which the government is forced to step in, which could be decided as early as today, the most likely outcome is that BES will be saved and isolated from other parts of the ESFG conglomerate, which would in turn fail. However even here, retail customers who invested in ESFG's commercial paper will be covered, as the Bank of Portugal forced the group to build a special provision of \u20ac700 million to deal with such circumstances. Blowback for the sovereign will also likely be limited. Not only are the likely holes to be covered small and manageable, but the government does also not need to tap capital markets anytime soon. To facilitate program exit, the government has covered its financing needs for more than one year. As a result, we do not see any material risk for the sovereign. While the Espirito Santo crisis was unfolding today, public service workers were taking to the streets of Lisbon for an anti-austerity protest. The demonstration was organised to oppose the government's labour market reforms, and its general social and economic policies. One protesters also carried a banner suggesting Portugal should quit the euro: A heads-up for tomorrow.... some shareholders in fashion firm Burberry are likely to revolt over the \u00a320m pay packet handed to new CEO Christopher Bailey. Critics say the deal fails to link pay with performance, but it's not clear that the plan will actually be blocked. It could be an uncomfortable meeting, though. Burberry set for tough reception over chief executive's pay packet The Wall Street Journal has put together a very useful background piece. It explaind the links between Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo and its parent company, the Esp\u00edrito Santo International conglomerate, which sparked the current crisis by delaying the repayment of some short-term debt this week. Here's a flavour: Esp\u00edrito Santo International SA is the vehicle used by Portugal\u2019s influential Esp\u00edrito Santo family to run various businesses, from hotels to hospitals and banks. Most of its holdings are in Portugal. The conglomerate is based in Luxembourg and because it is privately held, not much is known about it and its financial situation. An audit conducted by Portugal\u2019s central bank, however, has found that the company is in a \u201cserious financial condition\u201d and had uncovered accounting \u201cirregularities.\u201d Its problems aren\u2019t contained to itself, though: Esp\u00edrito Santo International used banking units with which it is associated to sell its debt and that of its units to retail and institutional clients. Among the banking units are Portugal\u2019s second largest lender, Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo SA, whose shares have been hit hard by fears of its exposure to the troubled parent and were suspended on Thursday. The bank has said it doesn\u2019t have direct exposure to Esp\u00edrito Santo International\u2019s debt, but it has lent \u20ac823 million ($1.1 billion) to Esp\u00edrito Santo Financial Group SA, which is part-owned by ESI, and has a \u20ac200 million exposure to another ESI unit.... What, Exactly, Is Esp\u00edrito Santo? The Financial Times is reporting tonight that the Portuguese government is likely to step in to help Esp\u00edrito Santo bank. They write: A banker who has worked closely with BES said the Portuguese bank had a \u20ac2bn-\u20ac3bn a capital shortfall and the most likely solution was some kind of state-brokered rescue deal, as a private sector solution would take too long. \u201cThere are rumours of an M&amp;A solution, but no one has the speed to do the necessary due diligence and move fast enough to do a deal,\u201d the banker said. \u201cThis needs a solution now \u2013 in the next couple of weeks \u2013 and that means a state intervention.\u201d A reminder of how the main European stock markets all fell: Does the International Monetary Fund's statement on Portugal calm the situation, or make it worse? The FT's investment editor, James Mackintosh reckons the interjection could be worrying: Reuters is reporting that Portugal's central bank has declared that Espirito Santo bank's solvency remains \"solid\". Bank of Portugal has also said that steps have been taken to prevent contagion spreading from Espirito Santo Financial Group. The International Monetary Fund has just issued a statement on the situation in Portugal: IMF Response to Press Queries regarding Portuguese Bank Espirito Santo \u201cThe Portuguese banking system has been able to endure the crisis without significant disruption, aided by substantial public capital support and extraordinary measures from the ECB. However, as the Bank of Portugal acknowledges, pockets of vulnerability remain, warranting corrective measures in some cases and intrusive supervision in others. The IMF does not comment on individual financial institutions.\u201d After that early wobble, the Dow Jones index is recovering a little -- but it's still down 0.5% Espirito Santo's problems are a wake-up call to investors who glibly piled into peripheral eurozone bonds since the debt crisis eased. So warns Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics. She is also concerned that the dangerous links between eurozone governments and their banks haven't been broken. McKeown says: We have been arguing for some time that the markets have become complacent about the financial risks in Portugal and in the periphery of the euro-zone more generally. The recent news has therefore added weight to our view that Portuguese bond yields are unsustainably low. And perhaps most worryingly, the associated rise in other peripheral governments\u2019 borrowing costs has confirmed that their fortunes remain closely tied not only to those of their own banks but also to each other. What, Barclays analysts wondered, were Portugal's lenders playing at during its three years bailout programme? Europe's stock markets have closed with losses across the board, as the unfolding problems in Portugal hit reignited fears over the European financial sector The Portuguese index tumbled by 4%, dragged down by Banco Espirito Santo's 17% fall (before it was suspended). Germany's DAX fell 1.3%, and the Spanish, Italian and French markets also suffered. The selloff came after Esp\u00edrito Santo Financial Group, part-owner of Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, Portugal\u2019s largest listed bank, appeared to hit problems. ESPG's shares were also suspended today, at its request, due to \"ongoing material difficulties at its largest shareholder Esp\u00edrito Santo International\u201d. [full coverage starts here]. The FTSE 100 shed 45 points to hit its lowest close since late April. The blue-chip index fell 0.68%, to 6672, meaning it has lost around 200 points this week. Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, said the problems at Espirito Santo Financial Group have hit markets worldwide: \u201cBanco Espirito Santo is the most important event right now impacting European equities. Investors are dumping the shares and bonds of the Portuguese lender on the news that its parent company Espirito Santo Financial Group SA has missed a debt payment. The local central bank is assuring investors that BES is shielded from the parent company credit. The event has hit European financials like a torpedo and has revived investors darkest nightmares about Europe.\u201d It's the first time in some months that European fears have hit the markets like this. As flagged up at 12.12pm, a sale of Greek bonds was hit by the Portuguese fears. That lacklustre demand has also added to the jitters today. Several European companies have also postponed debt sales today; fastFT reports that Spanish construction company ACS called off its inaugural euro bond sale today. There are also reports from Greece tonight that riot police have used violence on the laid-off cleaning workers protesting in Athens. The group, who are a symbol of the Greek people's suffering since the debt crisis began, have been picketing outside government buildings in an attempt to get their jobs back. As those of you who follow the stock markets will know, analysts and traders have been suggesting for weeks (if not months) that there could soon be a 'correction', after a long period of steady gains. The problems in Portugal have acted like a catalyst. As Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG put its: With Portugal looking to be in trouble once again, prudent analysis has been thrown out of the window in preference to a knee-jerk reaction. Portuguese bond yields aren\u2019t soaring (yet), and the contagion hasn't spread to Spain or Italy (yet), but the combination of the news from Lisbon and more data that confirms the weakness of the eurozone has provided the excuse to finally kick start the summer volatility trade into life. Or, in fewer characters: Elsewhere in the eurozone.... Greek authorities have highlighted their determination to crack down on the neo-nazi Golden Dawn. Magistrates demanded that the party\u2019s spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris be imprisoned pending trial, as our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Ilias Kasidiaris, for many the face of Golden Dawn, was led away to the special wing of Athens\u2019 Korydallos prison after appearing before the two magistrates assigned to investigate the alleged illegal activities of the neo-nazi organization. His imprisonment, on charges of illegal weapons possession, brings to nine the number of Golden Dawn MPs now currently in prison pending trial on charges of running a criminal organization that masqueraded as a political group. The step illuminates what many are describing as the renewed determination of the two female judges to close the Golden Dawn file before times runs out: the magistrates have 18 months to get the trial up, running and completed before they are forced to release the MPs again. Kasidiaris, who ran for Athens mayor and garnered 16% of the vote in local elections in May, strongly denied that he had been in possession of illegal weapons, showing reporters the permits he had for two hunter shot guns he is accused of transforming into automatic weapons, The MP\u2019s lawyers, who said they would be appealing the decision, repeated that the politician\u2019s incarceration was part of a political plot orchestrated by the government to eradicate a party that has shot from being a fringe group to the country\u2019s third biggest political force. But judicial authorities, who had privately regretted Kasidiarias being freed on bail when he was arrested for allegedly overseeing Golden Dawn\u2019s paramilitary activities last year, appear in no mood to compromise this time round. The former commando, who is believed to have ambitions to lead the party, had spent the last nine months reorganizing and softening the group's image - a move that has seen it go from strength to strength on the back of the country's worst economic crisis in living memory. In May the newly revamped Golden Dawn succeeded in sending three MEPS to the European parliament. Kasidiaris rose to fame slapping two leftwing female politicians on live TV back in 2012 \u2013 a shocking feat that at the peak of Greece\u2019s economic crisis only saw the party\u2019s popularity\u2019s ratings rise. Today's selloff is a blow to anyone who took part in Banco Espirito Santo's recent rights issue. It raised funds by selling new shares at \u20ac0.65 each. Today's 17% tumble sent them down to just \u20ac0.51 before trading was suspended. Banco Espirito Santo's problems come at a tricky time for the banking sector, points out Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets: Banks in particular are under massive scrutiny with European banks being targeted by the US regulators while banks in the US and Europe face tougher capital requirements as part of bank stress tests. With tougher capital requirements, it means banks need to keep more money in reserve and can\u2019t lend it out and make returns. This problem is exacerbated in Europe where weak economies are not generating demand for banks loans in the first place. It's a vicious circle -- the weak economic growth also makes it harder for companies to risk taking out more loans, especially if they don't see strong demand. We're not free of World Cup analogies yet.... Bank fears reignite Portugal market tensions Worries over the health of one of Portugal's largest financial groups hit the country's stock market hard on Thursday and pushed up its borrowing rates. The tensions are centered on the Espirito Santo group of companies, which includes Portugal's largest bank Banco Espirito Santo. Share trading in the bank was suspended after a precipitous fall of more than 16 percent, dragging the Lisbon stock exchange down more than 4% and pushing up the yield on Portugal's benchmark 10-year bonds by 0.13 percentage points to 3.89 percent. Sentiment was knocked across Europe, and the Stoxx 50 index of leading European shares was down 1.4%. The market moves provided an unwelcome reminder to investors of the tensions that gripped Europe for much of the past few years, when concerns over the state of the public finances in a number of countries that use the euro were at their most acute. Portugal became the third eurozone country after Greece and Ireland to require a financial rescue when it got a \u20ac78bn ($106bn) bailout in 2011. In return, successive governments have had to enact tough austerity measures, such as cutting spending and reforming the economy. Portugal's efforts in recent years to get its public finances into shape have helped it regain the trust of investors. That was manifested in the fall in the interest rates the country pays on its borrowings. As a result, Portugal concluded its three-year international bailout program in May, with the government confident it can raise money in the markets. The government insists Banco Espirito Santo is solid, but a parliamentary committee says it intends to call the finance minister and the governor of the Bank of Portugal to answer questions about the Espirito Santo group of companies. Banco Espirito Santo is being engulfed by a cascade of bad news from other family group companies, and investors fear it is vulnerable. It is part of a banking dynasty dating back to the 19th century, and the Espirito Santo family is the bank's largest shareholder with around 25 percent. The other shareholders include France's Credit Agricole, Brazil's Banco Bradesco and Portugal Telecom. An audit requested by Portugal's central bank in May found \"serious\" accounting irregularities at Luxembourg-based Espirito Santo International, an unlisted holding company whose board of directors included Ricardo Salgado, chief executive of Banco Espirito Santo. Investors fear the holding company's financial problems could contaminate other parts of the Espirito Santo group, including Rioforte, the group's non-financial holding company which manages assets in tourism and private health care among other interests, as well as the bank. Portuguese banks recorded heavy losses during Portugal's bailout but passed the so-called \"stress tests\" demanded by the European Central Bank to assess whether they were sound. Europe's stock markets remain deep in the red too, led by Portugal's PSI index Many banking shares are down by 3% or 4%: Wall Street has just opened, and the main share indices have promptly dropped as US investors react to the selloff in Europe. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by almost 1%, losing 159 points to 16826. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq index shed 1.5%, as Espirito Santo International's problems hits markets on both side of the Atlantic. There's no suggestion that Banco Espirito Santo customers are panicking, by the way, despite concerns over the health of its parent company. This photo of a branch in Lisbon shows a definite absence of queues.... The Wall Street Journal has pulled together more analyst reaction to the situation at Esp\u00edrito Santo International (ESI) after it suspended some bond repayments on certain short-term bonds yesterday, and the knock-on impact on Portuguese lender Banco Espirito Santo (BES). Analysts at the Royal Bank of Canada highlighted that the problems relating to ESI could have a much wider impact on the country's economy if they persist. \"While the aforementioned case is likely to be an isolated one it clearly highlights the problems of early bailout exits whilst the economy, the banking system and the public finances are still in a shaky state,\" they wrote in a note. Alberto Gallo, a credit strategist at the Royal Bank of Scotland said that although BES is not directly responsible for the repayment of any ESI bonds, it \"is subjected to reputational risks given its link to the group.\" More here: European Markets Tumble on Portuguese Bank Woes Here's a useful chart explaining how Banco Espirito Santo fits into the Espirito Santo Group structure. Shares on Wall Street are also expected to fall when trading begins in around 30 minutes: Another reason not to panic too much -- as Aurelija Augulyte of Nordea Markets points out, Portuguese government bond yields are still near their lowest point in four years: Here's an interesting chart - it shows how the cost of insuring Portuguese bank debt, using a credit default swap, has risen in the last month. A CDS of 344 means that it costs \u20ac344,000 to insure \u20ac10m of bank debt for a year. So, do the problems in Portugal mean the eurozone crisis has reared back into life? I don't think so. We've not suddenly been transported to the mad days of 2011 and 2012 again. Esp\u00edrito Santo International's problems are a reminder that southern Europe's economy is fragile, and that undeclared problems are still lurking in the banking sector But as analyst Megan Greene points out, Portugal simply isn't big enough to derail the eurozone. Concerns over Esp\u00edrito Santo have also been building for a while. Last December, the Wall Street Journal flagged up that the company raised funds during 2011 by selling debt to its own investment fund. The money was repaid, but the deal shows the potential clashes of interest that can arise with a major conglomerate. Portuguese government debt has also fallen in value today, driving up the yield on its 10-year bonds to around 4%, from 3.8% yesterday. That's a three-month high. The Portuguese worries flared up yesterday afternoon, when it emerged that conglomerate Esp\u00edrito Santo International was looking to restructure some of its debt. That sparked fears over the health of its businesses, triggering the 17% tumble in Banco Espirito Santo's shares today. WSJ: Espirito Santo International Delays Repayment of Debt to Private-Bank Clients Banco Espirito Santo shares slide on reports of holding company debt plan European stock markets are in retreat today, with losses across the board sparked by fears over Portugal's largest bank. The main Portuguese stock market, the PSI 20, has tumbled by 4.5% so far today, driven down by their biggest bank, Banco Espirito Santo (BES). Disappointingly weak manufacturing data from France, Italy and the Netherlands this morning (details here) has helped drive shares down, as investors worry that Europe's recovery is faltering. The main European markets have all been hit, pushing shares across the region to their lowest level in two months. Greece's underwhelming bond sale this morning has added to the jitters (and also suffered from them), wiping out the optimism created by the Federal Reserve last night. Concern is growing in Lisbon that BIS will be hit by financial problems at its parent company -- Espirito Santo Financial Group, which suspended trading in its own shares this morning. And in the last few minutes, trading in BES has also been suspended after tumbling 17%. As Jamie McGeever of Reuters shows, European banking shares have been falling for a while: More details and reaction to follow.... Allie Renison, head of Europe and Trade Policy at the Institute of Directors, reckons we shouldn't panic about Britain's widening trade gap. \u201cWhile first impressions are indeed worrying, it should be pointed out that that the widening gap is down to a rise in imports, which grew by 1.7% and are a sign of robust domestic demand\u201d. She also argues that exports are coping with the strong pound: \u201cContrary to expectations that the appreciation in sterling would lead to a reduction in the export of goods, there has been an increase of 0.6%. Indeed, when compared with the previous three months, export prices decreased by 0.8% for the three months ending in May. The Bank of England was right to leave interest rate unchanged today, reckons Dr Gerard Lyons, economic advisor to London mayor Boris Johnson. Investors are a little edgier about Greece today, after a much-anticipated bond sale drew modest demand. The interest rate, or yield, on Greek 10-year bonds has jumped to 6.3%, from 6.1% last night. That's quite a hefty move, but it still leaves yields away from the 'danger zone' of 7%. The selloff was triggered by a Greek bond sale, which hasn't proved as popular as its blockbuster auction three months ago. And lacklustre demand means buyers were able to secure a more lucrative rate of return on the bonds. Reuters and RANsquawk have more details: Order books for the bond have topped 3 billion euros, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters service. When Greece sold a five-year bond back in April orders reached over 20 billion euros. Bailed-out Greece is aiming to raise up to 3 billion euros from the new bond, its second bond sale after it defaulted in 2012. The Bank of England has also made no change to its quantitative easing programme, and there's no accompanying statement. To no-one's surprise, the Bank of England has left UK interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. It's official. M&amp;S's finance chief is off to Tesco. Here's the statement: MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC ANNOUNCES THE DEPARTURE OF ALAN STEWART Marks and Spencer Group plc today announces the departure of Alan Stewart, Chief Finance Officer. Alan has stepped down from Board and will leave M&amp;S on a date and on terms to be agreed. The search for his successor is already underway. And Tesco has announced that Stewart will receive a basic annual salary of \u00a3750,000 per year, plus replacement share awards worth \u00a31.737m. Those shares are being granted \"in lieu of his deferred share awards from Marks &amp; Spencer plc that will be forfeit when he joins Tesco\". Those share awards are meant to tie senior executives to a company, by linking pay to long-term performance -- that link is broken if you can simply get your new employer to offer the same terms.... Marks &amp; Spencer's troubles continue.... the word in the City is that Tesco has just poached M&amp;S's finance director, Alan Stewart. \u2022 11:18 - TESCO CLOSE TO NAMING MARKS &amp; SPENCER CFO ALAN STEWART AS NEW FINANCE DIRECTOR - SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH THE SITUATION At least he waited until after M&amp;S's AGM (on Tuesday)... Britain's widening trade deficit is a concern, says the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). Chief economist David Kern is worried that the progress made narrowing the deficit earlier this year has halted: Today\u2019s figures confirm that the pace of the UK\u2019s rebalancing towards net exports is far too slow, and if this continues we risk missing out on the Prime Minister\u2019s target of increasing exports to \u00a31tn by 2020. Therefore narrowing the trade deficit by providing additional support to UK exporters must remain a national priority for both the government and the MPC. On its part, the MPC must restore clarity to its forward guidance and resist calls for premature interest rate rises. UK exports to the EU have fallen by 0.9% in the last three months (if you strip out erratic items), but are up by 4.6% to the rest of the world. That's via Christian Schulz, economist at Berenberg, who explains: Trade growth has been more buoyant vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the world than with Britain\u2019s EU partners. And is the strong pound hitting exporters? Schulz reckons not.... British exports are relatively price insensitive, sterling is still below pre-crisis levels vis-\u00e0-vis major trading partners\u2019 currencies and global demand growth matters more than the exchange rate. Britain's widening trade gap illustrates how the UK's recovery has been driven by the domestic economy, rather than strong global demand. And with Europe's economy still weak, it's hard to see that changing quickly. As Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, flags up: \u201cThe shortfall of exports relative to imports is the largest since January. Exports picked up slightly in the month, while imports rose at their fastest pace for almost a year. \u201cLooking forward, we doubt that the export picture will brighten significantly, at least in the near-term. The recovery in the Eurozone economy, the UK\u2019s largest single export market, is running at only a very modest pace. And here's another chart showing how Britain's trade gap with Germany, the Netherlands and China widened in May: The full data is online here. Britain's trade gap with the rest of the world has swelled in May, as the UK was hit by weak demand from Europe. Exports of goods to the European Union fell by 0.2% during the month, while exports of goods to countries outside the EU increased by 1.5%. Exports to Germany and the Netherlands both fell during the month, as this chart shows: The goods balance (physical exports minus imports) widened to -\u00a39.2bn in May, from -\u00a38.8bn in April. That's a worse result than expected. Total imports jumped 2% during the month, while exports rose by 1.1%. The Office for National Statistics said this was partly due to an increase in imports of aircraft. Britain's traditional surplus in services was little changed at \u00a36.78bn. The total trade balance thus widened, to -\u00a32.418bn, from -\u00a32.05bn in April. Despite the strong recovery, Britain has struggled to improve its trading position with the rest of the world, as this chart shows: Imports have also outstripped exports over the last three months. The ONS reports: In the three months ending May 2014, exports of goods increased by 0.1% to \u00a372.6 billion and imports of goods increased by 0.5% to \u00a398.9 billion....The export of goods excluding oil and erratics increased by 0.9% to \u00a360.6 billion; reflecting a \u00a30.4 billion increase in exports of cars. Imports of goods excluding oil and erratics increased by 0.2% to \u00a383.8 billion for the same period. Wham! Two more European countries have reported that their industrial output fell in May, adding to worries about the European economy sparked by France this morning. Italian industrial output slid by 1.2% during the month, the steepest monthly fall since November 2012. That's much worse than expected -- economists had predicted a rise of 0.2%. That means that Italian industrial production is down by -0.4% over the last quarter, compared to the previous three months. And over the last 12 months, Italian industrial production has decreased by 1.8% compared with May 2013. A spokeswoman for national statistics institute ISTAT described the data as \"very negative\" (via Reuters). The Dutch manufacturing sector also struggled in May, with output slumping by 1.9% during the month. It's up just 0.5% over the last year, and the recent trend is downwards.... It's a worrying echo of France's troubles -- as covered earlier this morning, French manufacturing output tumbled by 2.3% in May. But everyone seems to have suffered - yesterday, we learned UK manufacturing output fell by 1.3%, while the German powerhouse suffered its biggest fall in two years, down 1.8%. What went wrong in May? Can it really just be the May bank holidays? More worrying signs for France -- its annual inflation rate has dropped to just 0.6% (on a harmonised basis) INSEE reported that food prices were down 1.4% year-on-year, and manufactured products down 1.2%, underlining the weakness of parts of the French economy. Inflation in the service sector, though, was up 1.8%. In other corporate news, Mothercare's interim CEO has been given the job fulltime. Mark Newton-Jones, who was parachuted into the company in March, is quite a retail veteran -- at just 25, he was a regional manager at Next covering 100+ stores, and he ran Shop Direct (including littlewoods.com), for nearly 10 years. Newton-Jones will get a basic salary of \u00a3600,000 per year for running Mothercare, which has rejected a takeover approach from US rival Destination Maternity. That's around \u00a3100k more than his predecessor. The upturn in Britain's property sector has boosted housebuilder Barratt Developments. It posted a 8.6% jump in sales this morning, and have shareholders the welcome news that profits will hit the top end of expectations. Burberry isn't the only company fretting about the strong pound. Associated British Foods (owner of Primark), has warned that sterling's strength will have \"a negative impact\" on its sales and profits from overseas businesses, particularly in Grocery and Ingredients. And that is on track to knock \u00a350m of ABF's profits, it suggests. Shares in UK fashion chain Burberry jumped 4% in early trading, despite warning that the strong pound is still eating into its profits. Burberry is topping the FTSE 100 after reporting a 12% surge in comparable sales in the last three months. That helped calm investors' worries over the \"increasing currency headwinds\" which the company is suffering, due to the strong pound. Burberry is on track to lose \u00a310m in licensing revenue in Japan, and the impact on overall profits this year \"will be material\", if rates remain at present levels. Company boss Christopher Bailey (chief creative and chief executive officer), reckoned the sales jump: ...demonstrates our teams' success in unlocking the benefits of these investments, as we continue to concentrate on the things we can control in an uncertain external environment. France's economy has taken another blow - with manufacturing output slumping by an alarming 2.3% in May. Statistics body INSEE said manufacturing output fell \"dramatically\" during the month. The wider measure of industrial output also fell, by 1.7%, which will fuel concerns over the eurozone's second largest economy. The survey suggests France's industrial sector struggled badly in May, with almost all industries reporting a drop in output. Electrical and electronic equipment production fell by 4.9%, and transport manufacturing fell 3.5%. And output in the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products \"plummeted\" by 8.4%, INSEE reported. So what happened? French public holidays may have exacerbated the downturn. INSEE says three holidays fell on Thursdays, meaning firms may have shut down on the Friday too. But as this graph shows, French manufacturing output has fallen by 0.9% over the last three months, as its economy struggles. France isn't alone, though. Recent data has shown that German and UK industrial output also fell in May, making some analysts wonder if the European economy hit trouble during the month.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, eurozone and business. After a few shaky days, European stock markets are set for a calm open after the Federal Reserve showed last night that it's in no rush to raise interest rates. The minutes of the Fed's last monetary policy meeting did show that its quantitative-easing programme is on track to end in October. So, less new money flowing into the markets. Federal Reserve likely to end QE stimulus program in October But that is tempered by signs that the Fed is too worried about America's labour markets to start raising interest rates soon. The minutes showed that many Fed policymakers are worried about the amount of spare capacity, or \"slack\", in the economy. Here's the key line: \u201cA number of them thought [the spare capacity] was greater than measured by the official unemployment rate....citing, in particular, the still-high level of workers employed part time for economic reasons or the depressed labour force participation rate.\u201d Several Fed committee members also welcomed the prospect of US real wages rising, rather than fretting about the impact on inflation. And that's being taken as a sigh that the Fed's still pretty dovish about economic prospects. As Stan Shamu of IG explains: The market seems to have been positioned for a hawkish shift in sentiment. In fact, the minutes showed the Fed continues to show concern about growth rather than inflation. Which may be enough to stop the FTSE 100 falling for the fourth day running... Here's IG's opening calls: FTSE: 6720 +2 German DAX: 9816 +8 French CAC: 4362 +2 Spanish IBEX: 10765 +18 Italian MIB: 20900 +15 What else is afoot? The Bank of England's monetary policy committee ends its monthly meeting. It's not expected to make any changes to interest rates or its asset purchase scheme (QE) though. On the economic front, there's the latest UK trade data (9.30am BST) and US weekly jobless numbers (1.30pm BST). Plenty of corporate news around too -- including another warning from Burberry that it's suffering from the strong pound, and strong-looking numbers from housebuilder Barratt (of which more shortly....)",

      "bodyText": "Former WH Smith boss Kate Swann enjoyed a bumper payday on Thursday as she collected \u00a33.7m in cash from the sale of shares and a special bonus on the successful flotation of SSP, the company which runs shops and food outlets in airports and railway stations. The London-based company, which runs nearly 2,000 outlets in 29 countries, launched at a share price of 210p, the lower end of its 200p to 240p expected range, valuing the business at \u00a3997m. The business, which owns the Upper Crust and Caff\u00e8 Ritazza brands, raised proceeds of \u00a3427.3m after fees and expenses of \u00a340m. The company will use \u00a3395m to pay down debts, leaving it with about \u00a3450m of net debt. SSP was priced to go after a string of disappointing market listings in recent months, but the shares rose nearly 3% to 215.75p on their first day of conditional trading. On top of a \u00a31.32m cash bonus she received for bringing SSP to the stockmarket, Swann sold shares worth \u00a32.4m in the float. She will also be paid a basic salary of \u00a3750,000, and could earn twice that again in bonus payouts if she reaches annual profit performance targets. She is also left with a 1% stake in the business that is worth \u00a39.9m, having joined SSP as CEO less than a year ago. Swann's latest fortune comes on top of the \u00a313m in cash, shares and share options she left WH Smith with last year. The highly-regarded retail boss, who defied City expectations to maintain steady profit growth at WH Smith by cutting costs and moving out of less profitable goods such as CDs and DVDs, is seen as one of the main attractions for new SSP investors. She said: \"We are very pleased with the level of support that we have received from a broad range of investors during the IPO process. It is a strong endorsement of SSP's strategy, and of the potential for future growth that we see for our business.\" EQT, the Swedish private equity firm which owned a majority stake in SSP, did not sell shares in the flotation, and will retain a stake of about 45%. It will sit alongside new blue-chip investors including Old Mutual, which owns a 5.9% stake, Artemis Investment Mangaement, which holds 3.8% and JP Morgan Asset Management which owns a 3.6% on flotation. The relatively disappointing list price for SSP comes after analysts warned that investors would shy away from another debt-laden private equity-backed retailer joining the London Stock Exchange. In recent months, Bridgepoint-backed Fat Face pulled plans for an initial public offering after running into investor apathy, while Elliot Advisers' Game Digital was forced to lower its price range. Meanwhile shares in KKR's Pets at Home chain continue to trade below the float price.",

The OBR, which developed a new method of predicting future price movements by bringing together a range of property value measures, said:\"The model implies that house prices will consistently rise faster than income, barring a strong and historically unprecedented response from housing supply, leading to a steady rise in household debt relative to income.\" The OBR said it wanted to give the government and the Bank of England a clear picture of the path house prices will take over the coming years, though it admitted much of its analysis was subject to judgments by researchers. Many academics and City analysts have predicted property price rises above annual earnings increases following a dramatic rise in the population and only moderate increases in the supply of homes. The OBR said publishing detailed diagnostic tests of historical data would allow policymakers to understand how changes in interest rates and other factors will influence prices over time. In a separate paper on Thursday, the OBR said a growing population based on more immigration was needed to tackle Britain's ageing population, which would put a greater strain on the public purse than previously feared.The OBR said the latest population projections suggested government spending would have to rise by about \u00a380bn in today's money \u2013 or almost 5% of GDP \u2013 between 2017-18 and 2063-64 to cope with an older population. Giving its annual verdict on the sustainabllity of the public finances over the next 50 years, the independent body said the worsening financial burden could mean further tax rises or spending cuts were needed after the chancellor's current round is completed. The cost of healthcare, pension payouts and long-term care would all increase as the proportion of the population aged 65 and over rises to 27% by 2064 from 17% this year, the OBR said. Robert Chote, OBR chairman, said: \"Compared to last year, the latest population projections suggest there will be fewer people of working age, more people in their 80s and 90s, and roughly the same number of children. So the ratio of workers to non-workers is lower, which increases fiscal pressures. \"As a result, some additional fiscal tightening is likely to be needed after the current crisis-related consolidation has been implemented.\" In comments that are likely to be picked up by anti-immigration campaigners, Chote said more immigration than is currently forecast would improve the outlook for the public finances over the next half a century. \"This is because inward migrants are more likely to be of working age than the rest of the population. So we avoid the cost of educating them and some will leave before we have to finance them in old age. But the impact may be less beneficial over a longer time horizon as more inward migrants retire,\" he said. Overall, Chote said the long-term outlook for the public finances was \"slightly less unsustainable\" than at the time of its last report a year ago because the government has since extended public spending cuts for an extra year to 2018-19, and will link the state pension age to rising life expectancy. That means that by 2064, people are likely to have to work until 70 before being eligible for a state pension, saving the government about \u00a314bn a year at today's prices. George Osborne, said: \"[The] report from the OBR provides further evidence that the government's long-term economic plan is working and the country's hard work is paying off. It shows that as a result of the decisions we have taken over the past year, in the next 50 years, debt as a share of our national income will be two thirds of GDP lower than it would have been.\" Meanwhile, in a blow to Alex Salmond's campaign for Scottish independence, the OBR sharply lowered its forecasts for North Sea oil and gas revenues. It expects a total of about \u00a340bn or 0.06% of GDP will be raised in North Sea revenues between 2020 and 2041, down by a quarter compared with its expectations last year as production falls. Scotland's yes camp is more optimistic on the outlook for oil production. A spokesman for the Scottish energy minister, Fergus Ewing, said: \"North Sea oil is a bonus, not the basis, of an independent Scotland's economy, and is a fantastic asset which will be around for many decades to come. But in an independent Scotland that oil wealth will be properly invested, not squandered, as it has been by successive Westminster governments. \"The OBR's forecasts rest on estimates of future production which are well below those used by the industry, by leading experts and by the UK government.\"",

These trusts ... comply with UK law and returns are made to HMRC in accordance with treaties set up between the two countries. If beneficiaries receive income from the trusts, they have and always will return them in their annual tax returns in the normal way and are subject to UK tax.\" Bruce Gyngell, TV An Australian tycoon, the late Bruce Gyngell founded TV-am and set up Jersey trusts for his wife and children \u2013 one of whom, David, was in the headlines this year for brawling with James Packer on Bondi Beach. His widow, Kathy, works for the rightist Centre for Policy Studies. She said: \"I am choosing not to comment.\" Rothermere family, Daily Mail A Lady Rothermere trust is recorded in Jersey. It appears to refer to the late Lord Rothermere's second wife, Maiko Lee, of Korean nationality. She did not respond to our invitations to comment. Rothermere's son Jonathan by his first wife inherited the Daily Mail, also through a Jersey trust, and a Bermuda-registered offshore entity. Jonathan is estimated to be worth \u00a3760m. He has not denied claiming tax concessions as a \"non-dom\", on the grounds that his father lived in Paris. He resides at Ferne Park, a stately home in Wiltshire built for him by architect Quinlan Terry. Bernie Madoff, fraudster The names of Bernie Madoff and of MSI (Madoff Securities International), the London end of his financial operation, are among the most unexpected entries in Kleinwort Benson's Jersey records. Madoff is serving 150 years in a federal prison for masterminding a \u00a338bn fraud \u2013 one of the biggest ever on Wall Street. Shortly before his downfall in 2008, MSI funded one of his more notorious purchases \u2013 a \u00a34m yacht, called the Bull, to be registered in his wife's name and moored on the French Riviera. \u2022 This footnote was added on 21 July 2014 and amended on 22 July. The Channel Islands offshore trust referred to in the section on Sir James Dyson was set up by Orbis Trustees Guernsey Limited. Kleinwort Benson purchased Orbis after the trust was wound up in 1999. Dyson is not and never has been a client of Kleinwort Benson.",

      "bodyText": "Burberry is braced for a substantial protest vote at Friday's annual general meeting after the British luxury brand angered investors with a more than \u00a320m pay deal for new chief executive Christopher Bailey. Investor groups Pirc and the Investment Management Association (IMA) have flagged their concerns ahead of the event with proxy voting firm Manifest giving the company's pay policy and report a \"D\". In the past companies that have attracted that type of criticism have suffered protest votes of around 30%. \"I think there will be a significant no vote but I don't think it will be a majority,\" said one investor. \"There seems to be a lack of clear linkage between pay and performance. Christopher Bailey has been a very successful creative director but there is no guarantee he will be a successful chief executive and Burberry are paying him as if he already is one.\" In May the Guardian revealed details of Bailey's contract which includes a \u00a3440,000 cash allowance. Other elements of his remuneration include a \u00a31.1m salary, an annual cash bonus of up to twice that salary and share awards of up to four times salary. Last summer the company also handed Bailey a one-off award of free shares worth almost \u00a315m. \"The cash allowance isn't the key issue,\" said Manifest chief executive Sarah Wilson. \"Very few companies in the FTSE 100 have such poor pay governance procedures so Burberry's approach is going to have disappointed many shareholders.\" Pirc, which has advised shareholders to vote against the company's remuneration policy, warned, among other things, that executive directors' incentive schemes are \"excessive\" as potential payouts could be more than eight times their base salary. In turn the IMA, whose members manage \u00a34.5tn of assets, issued an \"amber top\" alert over pay \u2013 its second most serious level of rebuke on corporate governance. The shareholder meeting comes hot on the heels of a strong set of figures from the trenchcoat-maker. On Thursday Burberry said like-for-like sales rose 12% in the three months to 30 June which was ahead of analysts forecasts of around 8%. There was a sting in the tail, however, with finance director Carol Fairweather warning the strong pound would take a bigger bite out of profits this year than previously thought. Burberry's fixed costs are in Sterling but its revenues are in a variety of currencies with adverse movements expected to reduce annual profits by \u00a365m rather than \u00a350m previously outlined. That did not dent investors' enthusiasm for the company with Burberry the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 with the shares closing up more than 3% at \u00a314.64. Bailey, who to date has been reticent in his dealings with the business press, did not join a conference call with journalists but said in a statement: \"This first quarter performance reflects our focus on striving to give customers the best possible experience of the Burberry brand through ongoing investment in retail, digital and service, both on and offline. The 12% increase in comparable sales demonstrates our teams' success in unlocking the benefits of these investments, as we continue to concentrate on the things we can control in an uncertain external environment.\" Larger rivals such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci have seen sales start to slow as big spenders tire of global brands that are too ubiquitous. Demand in China, a key luxury goods market, has also been hit by a government crackdown on corruption and conspicuous spending. However Burberry bucked that trend to report growth of more than 10% in the Asia Pacific region \"led by mainland China\". Burberry's continued success is in part down to its willingness to embrace the digital fashion revolution. It streams its catwalk shows online and in stores, allowing customers to order products for early delivery with a personalised touch, such as an engraved nameplate in a coat or bag. A presence on Chinese social media sites such as Sina Weibo (the country's version of Twitter), Youku (similar to YouTube) and Douban has also helped Burberry outperform rival brands in the region. Barclays analyst Julian Easthope believes the Burberry figures will turn out to be the best of its peer group over the period: \"This was despite a tough comparison with last year and reflects the group's ability to convert traffic both online and offline thanks to its investment in retail, digital and customer service.\"",

    "webTitle": "Nando's using secretive tax haven trust to avoid inheritance tax bills", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A secretive \u00a3750m trust located in a Channel Islands tax haven sits at the top of an elaborate offshore web of companies belonging to the family behind the Nando's chicken chain. The restaurant group \u2013 ultimately owned by Dick Enthoven, a South African tycoon \u2013 also uses a battery of offshore techniques, including companies in Malta, Guernsey and the Netherlands, to legally reduce its UK corporation tax bill by up to a third. The use of an offshore trust would mean that the Enthoven family would stand to avoid UK inheritance tax on all their fortune. But the restaurant group points out that it paid \u00a312.6m UK corporation tax last year. Nando's growing popularity has seen it become a British destination for a broad variety of customers, including celebrities such as David Beckham, Jay Z, as well as the prime minister during the campaign running up to the European election. Controversy over tax avoidance is mounting this week, with calls for the Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom to explain to the cabinet secretary a total of \u00a3816,000 of political donations to the Conservatives made by her own Guernsey banker brother-in-law. She claims she was unaware of their size. This week the Times newspaper named Sir Michael Caine and musicians Arctic Monkeys and Katie Melua as would-be beneficiaries of an aggressive tax avoidance scheme called Liberty. The Financial Times also this week identified Dame Clara Furse from the Bank of England financial policy committee and Lord Hollick as among the investors in Ingenious Media, another controversial scheme. Documents seen by the Guardian, which reveal past and present offshore clients of wealth managers Kleinwort Benson, are being published simultaneously in the US by the non-profit news organisation ICIJ, reveal a variety of legal offshoring activities which we invited business magnates to explain. Those named with offshore links include the Rothermere family, owners of the Daily Mail; Sir Ken Morrison of supermarket fame; the Laura Ashley family; Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder of easyJet; the inventor Sir James Dyson, the Malaysian tycoon Khoo Kay Peng; the software executive Martin Read; and the television boss Bruce Gyngell. The offshore world of Nando's is particularly elaborate. The family's personal cash pile, their \u00a38m Wiltshire stately home, and their corporate structures all have offshore addresses. Buy a \u00a37.30 portion of spicy chicken thighs at Nando's and the cash flows into a network of accounting devices, involving Malta, the Isle of Man, Guernsey, the Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg, Panama and the British Virgin Islands. Profits finally fetch up in Enthoven's Taro III Trust. It is based in Jersey and has been operated by Kleinwort Benson. This trust, not liable for UK tax, contains no less than \u00a3750m and possibly much more. Enthoven is a South African tycoon whose own Dutch father, Robert, amassed an insurance fortune. Dick's funds are behind much of Nando's international rise. Enthoven's structures are all legal, but they are complex and not transparent. They significantly reduce the amount of tax the company and the family pay around the world, compared to a conventional onshore British operation. As often in the offshore universe, one of the fruits of these manoeuvres turns out to be a classically English country estate, Spye Park in Wiltshire. The estate, which goes back to the 16th century, is occupied by Gigs and Robby Enthoven. Robby, who is Dick Enthoven's son, developed the UK end of the restaurant chain. But the registered owner of Spye Park is actually an anonymous British Virgin Islands offshore entity. Such arrangements can legally avoid capital gains tax, inheritance tax and potential future stamp duty for those like the Enthovens, whose South African heredity makes them \"non-doms\". Nando's owners also legally reduce their UK corporate tax bill by making various permissible payments offshore. Nando's does then pay UK corporation tax on the remainder of its profits. The British entity that operates the 280 UK restaurants last year paid over \u00a321m of its revenues as a royalty for using the Nando's brand name. The money goes to a low-tax Netherlands entity called Tortolli BV. Tortolli in turn collects the cash on behalf of another company registered in another tax haven , this time in Malta . Rent for the restaurants is paid to a separate UK company, itself also owned by a Netherlands intermediary. In addition, the financing to fit out each restaurant comes through Channel Island loans, with \u00a35m in \"finance charges\" last year moved offshore to an entity in Guernsey, called Nando's Leasing Ltd. The chicken business profits ultimately flow to a Luxembourg low-tax registered partnership. Accounts show the Luxembourg entity then pays cash over to the tax-free Jersey family trust as interest on a \u00a3750m loan. \"Richard Enthoven is the ultimate beneficial owner of Nando's,\" the company's spokesman told us. \"He is not resident in the US or the UK.\" This means that he is not liable to pay any British personal tax. Nando's spokesman stressed that the company does pay appreciable UK corporation tax and said its licensing fee was standard. \"In the UK, Nando's Group Holdings Ltd incurred corporation tax of \u00a312.6m on a profit of \u00a358.2m with revenues of \u00a3485.2m in the year ending February 2013,\" he said. The Guardian calculates that the tax bill might have been half as much again, at \u00a318m, had offshoring arrangements not existed. The company added: \"Nando's is a concept founded in South Africa. Nando's in the UK is one of 22 national franchises operating globally. All the franchises operate under standard market licensing arrangements and this includes the brand licensing fee. This franchising arrangement enables the UK company to access expertise, intellectual property and capital from the company's global operations and has helped fund its growth.\" Neither the Enthovens nor Nando's UK commented on the Taro III Trust or the company's other offshore structures.",

But the restaurant group points out that it paid \u00a312.6m UK corporation tax last year.</p> <p>Nando's growing popularity has seen it become a British destination for a broad variety of customers, including celebrities such as David Beckham, Jay Z, as well as the prime minister during the campaign running up to the European election.</p> <p>Controversy over tax avoidance is mounting this week, with calls for the Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom to explain to the cabinet secretary a total of \u00a3816,000 of political donations to the Conservatives made by her own Guernsey banker brother-in-law. She claims she was unaware of their size.</p> <p>This week the Times newspaper named Sir Michael Caine and musicians Arctic Monkeys and Katie Melua as would-be beneficiaries of an aggressive tax avoidance scheme called Liberty.</p> <p>The Financial Times also this week identified Dame Clara Furse from the Bank of England financial policy committee and Lord Hollick as among the investors in Ingenious Media, another controversial scheme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-441795264\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/10/1405015245415/nandos-011.jpg\" alt=\"nando's\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nando's fast food restaurant is ultimately owned by South African tycoon Dick Enthoven Photograph: Graeme Robertson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Documents seen by the Guardian, which reveal past and present offshore clients of wealth managers Kleinwort Benson, are being published simultaneously in the US by the non-profit news organisation <a href=\"http://www.icij.org/\" title=\"\">ICIJ</a>, reveal a variety of legal offshoring activities which we invited business magnates to explain.</p> <p>Those named with offshore links include the Rothermere family, owners of the Daily Mail; Sir Ken Morrison of supermarket fame; the Laura Ashley family; Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder of easyJet; the inventor Sir James Dyson, the Malaysian tycoon Khoo Kay Peng; the software executive Martin Read; and the television boss Bruce Gyngell.</p> <p>The offshore world of Nando's is particularly elaborate. The family's personal cash pile, their \u00a38m Wiltshire stately home, and their corporate structures all have offshore addresses.</p> <p>Buy a \u00a37.30 portion of spicy chicken thighs at Nando's and the cash flows into a network of accounting devices, involving Malta, the Isle of Man, Guernsey, the Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg, Panama and the British Virgin Islands.</p> <p>Profits finally fetch up in Enthoven's Taro III Trust. It is based in Jersey and has been operated by Kleinwort Benson. This trust, not liable for UK tax, contains no less than \u00a3750m and possibly much more.</p> <p>Enthoven is a South African tycoon whose own Dutch father, Robert, amassed an insurance fortune. Dick's funds are behind much of Nando's international rise.</p> <p>Enthoven's structures are all legal, but they are complex and not transparent. They significantly reduce the amount of tax the company and the family pay around the world, compared to a conventional onshore British operation.</p> <p>As often in the offshore universe, one of the fruits of these manoeuvres turns out to be a classically English country estate, Spye Park in Wiltshire. The estate, which goes back to the 16th century, is occupied by Gigs and Robby Enthoven. Robby, who is Dick Enthoven's son, developed the UK end of the restaurant chain.</p> <p>But the registered owner of Spye Park is actually an anonymous British Virgin Islands offshore entity.</p> <p>Such arrangements can legally avoid capital gains tax, inheritance tax and potential future stamp duty for those like the Enthovens, whose South African heredity makes them \"non-doms\".</p> <p>Nando's owners also legally reduce their UK corporate tax bill by making various permissible payments offshore. Nando's does then pay UK corporation tax on the remainder of its profits.</p> <p>The British entity that operates the 280 UK restaurants last year paid over \u00a321m of its revenues as a royalty for using the Nando's brand name. The money goes to a low-tax Netherlands entity called Tortolli BV. Tortolli in turn collects the cash on behalf of another company registered in another tax haven , this time in Malta .</p> <p>Rent for the restaurants is paid to a separate UK company, itself also owned by a Netherlands intermediary. In addition, the financing to fit out each restaurant comes through Channel Island loans, with \u00a35m in \"finance charges\" last year moved offshore to an entity in Guernsey, called Nando's Leasing Ltd.</p> <p>The chicken business profits ultimately flow to a Luxembourg low-tax registered partnership. Accounts show the Luxembourg entity then pays cash over to the tax-free Jersey family trust as interest on a \u00a3750m loan.</p> <p>\"Richard Enthoven is the ultimate beneficial owner of Nando's,\" the company's spokesman told us. \"He is not resident in the US or the UK.\" This means that he is not liable to pay any British personal tax.</p> <p>Nando's spokesman stressed that the company does pay appreciable UK corporation tax and said its licensing fee was standard.</p> <p>\"In the UK, Nando's Group Holdings Ltd incurred corporation tax of \u00a312.6m on a profit of \u00a358.2m with revenues of \u00a3485.2m in the year ending February 2013,\" he said.</p> <p>The Guardian calculates that the tax bill might have been half as much again, at \u00a318m, had offshoring arrangements not existed.</p> <p>The company added: \"Nando's is a concept founded in South Africa. Nando's in the UK is one of 22 national franchises operating globally. All the franchises operate under standard market licensing arrangements and this includes the brand licensing fee. This franchising arrangement enables the UK company to access expertise, intellectual property and capital from the company's global operations and has helped fund its growth.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//cloudfront-1.publicintegrity.org/widgets/syndication/node/15042\"> <iframe src=\"//cloudfront-1.publicintegrity.org/widgets/syndication/node/15042\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameBorder=\"0\" style=\"border: none; background: transparent; width: 0px; height: 0px;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Neither the Enthovens nor Nando's UK commented on the Taro III Trust or the company's other offshore structures.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's trade deficit unexpectedly grew to \u00a32.4bn in May, fuelling concerns that the strength of the pound is undermining efforts to increase exports. A small rise in exports in the month failed to offset a dip in April that had already sent a worrying signal that the booming domestic economy was having little impact on the trade balance. The overall trade deficit widened from \u00a32.1bn in April to \u00a32.4bn in May, official figures showed, in contrast to the consensus expectation among City economists for a narrowing to \u00a31.6bn. The shortfall between exports and imports was the largest since January, after imports rose at their fastest pace for almost a year \u2013 though much of the rise was blamed on an influx of aircraft parts. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"May's trade figures provided more disappointing news that manufacturers may be struggling to cope with sterling's strength. And with exporters still facing a number of headwinds, we expect export growth to remain sluggish for a while yet.\" Sterling has jumped from a low of around $1.40 in the aftermath of the financial crisis to $1.71 this week. Hollingsworth's view was echoed by several other economists, though Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said the figures should come with a health warning. He said surveys by Markit showed a strength of growth in manufacturing that must come, at least in part, from exports. \"It's hard to square the message from the official data with the surveys. Certainly the survey data sit more in line with the official data on manufacturing output over the past year. Despite a surprise 1.3% drop in production in May, output remained a buoyant 3.7% higher than a year ago. \"It's hard to see how such growth is being sustained without some support from export sales. On balance, it is likely that exports should strengthen in coming months, albeit with any rise tempered by sterling's appreciation,\" Williamson said. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, was more gloomy about the rest of the year, saying that the pound and the weakness of the eurozone economy would act as a drag on export growth. \"Looking forward, we doubt that the export picture will brighten significantly, at least in the near-term. The recovery in the eurozone economy, the UK's largest single export market, is running at only a very modest pace. \"And the continued appreciation of sterling, with the pound now at a near six-year high against the dollar, will damage UK exporters' cost competitiveness,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, robust rates of growth in UK consumer spending and investment are likely to translate into a further pick-up in import growth. Overall, the UK economy's expansion looks set to remain a largely domestic affair.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tour de France fever has given Halfords a boost, as Britain gets on its bike. The bike-and-car-parts chain posted a better than expected 7.9% rise in like-for-like retail sales in the 13 weeks to 27 June, with cycling powering 21.3% ahead, just days after the Tour de France came to Yorkshire and passed through London. Halfords said all areas in its cycling business recorded strong growth, led by a 35.1% surge in premium bike sales and a 72% rise in specialist clothing. Chief executive Matt Davies hailed an \"exceptional performance\" in Halford's cycling business, which benefited from \"favourable weather and increased interest in the Tour de France\" as well as an improved website service. He said that the exit of Britain's great hopes in the race \u2013 Mark Cavendish and Chris Froome who have both had to retire after crashes in the early stages \u2013 would not make a big difference to cycling sales. \"We don't believe this is temporary we believe that as a country we are falling more and deeper in love with cycling and recognising the joy and health benefits and the power of the bike as a commuter tool and we expect that to continue.\" The UK's \"summer of cycling\" also includes the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow which start on 23 July and Davies suggested that event would continue to boost interest in the sport. He said sales were growing in every type of cycling gear, from children's bikes to upmarket racers and even specialist food. Halfords recently snapped up Olympic champion Chris Boardman's bike company. Even before the acquisition, it was selling about 50,000 Boardman bikes a year \u2013 a range of road, mountain and hybrid bikes priced at between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,800. It is launching children's versions of the Boardman racing bikes. However, Davies warned: \"It's very difficult to generate this level of like-for-like sales growth year on year.\" Davies said Halfords was not raising its profit expectations for the year after just one quarter of strong growth. Although analysts said sales were ahead of their predictions, shares in the company dipped nearly 3% to 478p as hopes of an even stronger performance were disappointed. Davies said that the company did not need to maintain such high levels of cycling sales growth to achieve the aims of the three-year turnaround plan he outlined last year. For the first time in years, the retailer recorded growth in all its categories, including car maintenance, car improvement and its Autocentres car servicing chain as Davies said an improved range and new services had boosted sales. The retailer is winning market share from competitors thanks to improved stock availability and products, better trained and motivated staff and a switch from promoting mainly on price.",
