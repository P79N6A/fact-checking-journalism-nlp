      "bodyText": "Music and film retailer HMV is preparing to call in the administrators as it becomes the highest profile chain to collapse during the current economic malaise. Around 4,500 jobs are at risk at the 90-year-old retailer after its board called in Deloitte as administrators following poor results over the crucial Christmas trading period \u2013 when it traditionally makes most of its sales. Best known for its Nipper the dog trademark, HMV has failed to find a way through difficult economic conditions and fierce competition from supermarkets. It has been struggling with debts for just over two years, and while banks have revised the terms of their loans it was thought to been handed a lifeline after its suppliers, including Universal Music, EMI, Warner Brothers and Disney, were handed shares in exchange for improved commercial terms. But those firms were said last night to have refused to agree to provide additional financing to the retailer, leaving it with few options to find the extra resources needed to keep trading. HMV's website was still advertising its 25% off sale for thousands of products on Monday. The chain, which opened its first store in 1921 on London's Oxford Street and still owns the world's biggest record shop there, had been attempting to shift out of films and music and into accessories such as headphones.

It is one of several high street names to go to the wall over the past year, including the electrical retailer Comet, clothing chain Peacocks and JJB sports. HMV is arguably the highest profile name to collapse during the prolonged economic downturn and altering shopping habits that also forced Woolworths out of business five years ago, at the start of the banking crisis. Ironically the collapse of Woolworths had initially helped HMV, which enjoyed a peak in sales shortly afterwards, before the competition escalated from supermarkets and online retailers. A weak economy in the run-up to Christmas has exacerbated the woes of retailers struggling with business models overwhelmed by technological changes such as the explosion in camera phones, which destabilised Jessops, and the explosion in internet downloading which undermined demand for CDs and DVDs at HMV. With consumers less keen to spend over the key festive period, which is a make-or-break time for struggling retailers, Jessops and HMV have been unable to prove to their financiers that they have a viable business model.

Government spending is set by Congress, so if anyone has a problem on that point \u2013 especially in Congress \u2013 their time to address it has passed. The debt ceiling is just a number that tells us how much the Congress is allowed to commit the treasury to spend.</p> <p>As of this moment, the Congress committed more money to pay its bills than the treasury currently has on hand. The only entity that can fix this is Congress; neither treasury, nor White House, nor Federal Reserve has any power to raise taxes or increase spending on its own.</p> <p>So what would happen?</p> <p>There's a neat flowchart of events that would ensue. To make good on those IOUs \u2013 to pay its bills \u2013 the government has to raise the debt limit. If Congress does not raise the debt limit, the US is likely to default on its debt.

That will hurt the retirement accounts of ordinary Americans, at least for a time.</p> <p>As the \"crisis\" keeps going, we are likely to see worse effects: potential downgrades of the US credit rating, perhaps an uptick in the price the US has to pay to borrow money.

That doesn't even count the humiliation of having our credit ratings cut again, as they surely would be.</p> <p>The alternative: Congress could come up with a plan to balance the federal budget.</p> <p>Those who want to take the US into default believe that the country is strong enough to take it.

This time, the ratings agencies are expecting trouble, and nearly all have warned that the US will get a slap for flirting with default. Foreign investors, too, are no longer trapped in treasury bonds as the only attractive investment, as they were in 2011.

    "webTitle": "Government under pressure to stop banks deferring bonuses", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A political row has erupted over attempts by banks \u2013 led by Goldman Sachs \u2013 to defer bonus payments to enable highly paid bankers to benefit from the cut to income tax on 6 April. While the government insisted it could not comment on the \"tax affairs of individual companies\", Labour used the escalating row to call on the government to scrap the cut to the top rate. The rate was raised to 50% in 2010 but will fall to 45% at the start of the new tax year. Goldman Sachs also faced condemnation. \"They're so greedy they know no shame,\" said Lord Oakeshott, a former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman in the Lords. Chris Leslie, shadow Treasury minister, said that while banks needed to consider the reputational risk of delaying their bonuses to the new tax year, it was up to the chancellor and prime minister to stop such efforts to benefit top-rate taxpayers. \"Banks need to think carefully about their own reputations if they seek to avoid tax in this way, but the ultimate responsibility lies with David Cameron and George Osborne,\" said Leslie. \"They have refused to repeat Labour's bank bonus tax and pre-announced a \u00a33bn income tax cut for the richest people in the country, giving them the opportunity to delay income and bonuses until April. It cannot be right that this out of touch government is making millions of working people and pensioners on modest incomes pay more while giving millionaires and bankers a huge tax cut.\" Oakeshott added it was a \"real test for Cameron and Osborne\" and referred to remarks in June by the prime minister when he described tax avoidance used by comedian Jimmy Carr as \"morally wrong\". \"Will it be selective indignation all over again, criticising Starbucks but not Goldman? Osborne excoriated aggressive tax avoidance in the budget \u2013 he should now name and shame Goldman and confirm that this behaviour would disqualify them from government contracts,\" Oakeshott said. Goldman, which publishes its full-year results on Wednesday, is considering whether to push deferred bonuses from 2009, 2010 and 2011, which were scheduled to be handed to staff by the end of March, into the new tax year. Bonuses for 2012, which will be given to staff shortly, are not included in the plan currently being considered. A Treasury spokesman said: \"We do not comment on the tax affairs of individual companies, but we are clear that everyone must pay the tax they owe.\" If the Wall Street firm presses ahead with the idea it would be matching the steps it took to enable its US-based staff to avoid a tax hike at the start of the year when it paid out about \u00a340m in so-called restricted stock just as the \"fiscal cliff\" budget talks led to taxes being raised. City sources believe a number of banks considered whether to delay bonuses into the new tax year but that many have rejected the idea to avoid negative publicity in the wake of the row surrounding corporation tax paid by Starbucks in the UK. Some bankers will benefit from the income tax cut as their bonuses for 2012 are not paid until June. This includes employees at bailed-out banks Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, who receive any bonus above \u00a32,000 in shares in June at the earliest. Other big City players such as Credit Suisse, HSBC, JP Morgan and UBS are not making changes to the way they hand out their bonuses. The Unite union described banks as \"real shirkers\". Unite's Len McCluskey said: \"This is clear proof that the City has learned nothing. Any decent government would condemn this behaviour as a blatant case of tax avoidance and demand action.\" Campaigners at the Robin Hood Tax campaign, who want a new tax on the financial sector, also urged the government to act. \"The government should not stand idly by but must act to ensure the richest sector in the UK pays its fair share to save services and create jobs,\" a spokesman for the campaign said. \"Goldman Sachs's latest tax trick is lamentably true to form \u2013 fleecing the public purse to stuff the pockets of its bankers.\"",

      "body": "<p>A political row has erupted over attempts by banks \u2013 led by Goldman Sachs \u2013 to defer bonus payments to enable highly paid bankers to benefit from the cut to income tax on 6 April.</p> <p>While the government insisted it could not comment on the \"tax affairs of individual companies\", Labour used the escalating row to call on the government to scrap the cut to the top rate. The rate was raised to 50% in 2010 but will fall to 45% at the start of the new tax year.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs also faced condemnation. \"They're so greedy they know no shame,\" said Lord Oakeshott, a former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman in the Lords.</p> <p>Chris Leslie, shadow Treasury minister, said that while banks needed to consider the reputational risk of delaying their bonuses to the new tax year, it was up to the chancellor and prime minister to stop such efforts to benefit top-rate taxpayers.</p> <p>\"Banks need to think carefully about their own reputations if they seek to avoid tax in this way, but the ultimate responsibility lies with David Cameron and George Osborne,\" said Leslie.</p> <p>\"They have refused to repeat Labour's bank bonus tax and pre-announced a \u00a33bn income tax cut for the richest people in the country, giving them the opportunity to delay income and bonuses until April. It cannot be right that this out of touch government is making millions of working people and pensioners on modest incomes pay more while giving millionaires and bankers a huge tax cut.\"</p> <p>Oakeshott added it was a \"real test for Cameron and Osborne\" and referred to remarks in June by the prime minister when he described tax avoidance used by comedian Jimmy Carr as \"morally wrong\".</p> <p>\"Will it be selective indignation all over again, criticising Starbucks but not Goldman? Osborne excoriated aggressive tax avoidance in the budget \u2013 he should now name and shame Goldman and confirm that this behaviour would disqualify them from government contracts,\" Oakeshott said.</p> <p>Goldman, which publishes its full-year results on Wednesday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/14/goldman-sachs-bonus-payments-tax-rate-cut\" title=\"\">is considering whether to push deferred bonuses from 2009, 2010 and 2011</a>, which were scheduled to be handed to staff by the end of March, into the new tax year. Bonuses for 2012, which will be given to staff shortly, are not included in the plan currently being considered.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesman said: \"We do not comment on the tax affairs of individual companies, but we are clear that everyone must pay the tax they owe.\"</p> <p>If the Wall Street firm presses ahead with the idea it would be matching the steps it took to enable its US-based staff to avoid a tax hike at the start of the year when it paid out about \u00a340m in so-called restricted stock just as the \"fiscal cliff\" budget talks led to taxes being raised.</p> <p>City sources believe a number of banks considered whether to delay bonuses into the new tax year but that many have rejected the idea to avoid negative publicity in the wake of the row surrounding corporation tax paid by Starbucks in the UK. Some bankers will benefit from the income tax cut as their bonuses for 2012 are not paid until June. This includes employees at bailed-out banks Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, who receive any bonus above \u00a32,000 in shares in June at the earliest.</p> <p>Other big City players such as Credit Suisse, HSBC, JP Morgan and UBS are not making changes to the way they hand out their bonuses.</p> <p>The Unite union described banks as \"real shirkers\".</p> <p>Unite's Len McCluskey said: \"This is clear proof that the City has learned nothing. Any decent government would condemn this behaviour as a blatant case of tax avoidance and demand action.\"</p> <p>Campaigners at the Robin Hood Tax campaign, who want a new tax on the financial sector, also urged the government to act. \"The government should not stand idly by but must act to ensure the richest sector in the UK pays its fair share to save services and create jobs,\" a spokesman for the campaign said. \"Goldman Sachs's latest tax trick is lamentably true to form \u2013 fleecing the public purse to stuff the pockets of its bankers.\"</p>",

    "webTitle": "Marks & Spencer chief under fire as sales dip", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pressure is mounting on Marks &amp; Spencer boss Marc Bolland, after a major shareholder said his job is under threat unless the retailer's flagging clothing business improves by September. David Cumming of Standard Life Investments \u2013 the group's 10th largest shareholder with 1.6% of its stock \u2013 said Bolland had six to nine months to sort out clothing if he wanted to keep his job. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"He has to get his autumn range right, that's when the management changes that he's made will have an impact. I think the market will wait to see how that range \u2013 which doesn't really come through until six to nine months \u2013 is going to work. If that is poor then he'll be under a lot of pressure.\" Bolland shook up the management of the non-food business last July, replacing Kate Bostock with M&amp;S-lifer John Dixon, as head of general merchandise. In a surprise move, he also brought in Belinda Earl, the former chief executive of Debenhams and Jaeger, as style director, working three days a week. At the time, Bolland said it could take until July 2013 for the full effects of the new team to become apparent in stores. Cumming said shareholders were prepared to wait and see if the strategy had worked because the M&amp;S share price already reflected its difficulties and the group could still be subject to a bid from private equity. \"So us and the market will wait but he is under pressure,\" said Cumming. The company was hit by speculation last summer that it could be the target of a takeover bid, with rumours that US group CVC Capital Partners had considered buying the department store chain. Marks &amp; Spencer had a dreadful Christmas, with like-for-like sales of general merchandise \u2013 which includes clothing and other non-food items \u2013 dropping by almost 4%. That dragged overall like-for-likes down by 1.8% and caused many to question Bolland's future at the retailer. Asked whether he would be with the group to announce Christmas 2013's trading figures, Bolland said: \"We are very confident on the strategy, and I will be there next year.\" But the bookies are betting on Bolland's early departure, with Paddy Power offering odds of 3/1 that he will leave in the second half of the year. The group was also forced to release its Christmas trading figures early, after damaging sales figures were leaked, prompting some to query whether Bolland had rebels in his own head office as well as doubters among the company's shareholders. Bolland joined M&amp;S with much fanfare in 2009 from supermarket group Morrisons, where he was feted for having increased sales and profits in his three years at the helm. But M&amp;S shareholders now appear to be losing faith in his strategy for boosting sales at the department store. First-half profits, published in November, fell for the second year in a row after womenswear sales disappointed.

I think the market will wait to see how that range \u2013 which doesn't really come through until six to nine months \u2013 is going to work. If that is poor then he'll be under a lot of pressure.\"</p> <p>Bolland shook up the management of the non-food business last July, replacing Kate Bostock with M&amp;S-lifer John Dixon, as head of general merchandise. In a surprise move, he also brought in Belinda Earl, the former chief executive of Debenhams and Jaeger, as style director, working three days a week. At the time, Bolland said it could take until July 2013 for the full effects of the new team to become apparent in stores.</p> <p>Cumming said shareholders were prepared to wait and see if the strategy had worked because the M&amp;S share price already reflected its difficulties and the group could still be subject to a bid from private equity. \"So us and the market will wait but he is under pressure,\" said Cumming. The company was hit by speculation last summer that it could be the target of a takeover bid, with rumours that US group CVC Capital Partners had considered buying the department store chain.</p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/09/marks-and-spencer-sales-fall-christmas?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">had a dreadful Christmas</a>, with like-for-like sales of general merchandise \u2013 which includes clothing and other non-food items \u2013 dropping by almost 4%. That dragged overall like-for-likes down by 1.8% and caused many to question Bolland's future at the retailer.</p> <p>Asked whether he would be with the group to announce Christmas 2013's trading figures, Bolland said: \"We are very confident on the strategy, and I will be there next year.\" But the bookies are betting on Bolland's early departure, with Paddy Power offering odds of 3/1 that he will leave in the second half of the year.</p> <p>The group was also forced to release its Christmas trading figures early, after damaging sales figures were leaked, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/10/marks-and-spencer-sales-figures-leak?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">prompting some to query</a> whether Bolland had rebels in his own head office as well as doubters among the company's shareholders.</p> <p>Bolland <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/18/marc-bolland-marks-spencer\" title=\"\">joined M&amp;S with much fanfare</a> in 2009 from supermarket group Morrisons, where he was feted for having increased sales and profits in his three years at the helm. But M&amp;S shareholders now appear to be losing faith in his strategy for boosting sales at the department store.</p> <p>First-half profits, published in November, fell for the second year in a row after womenswear sales disappointed. At the time Bolland promised the clothing ranges would become \"much more stylish and more trend-driven\".</p> <p>While this did not appear to have happened in time to attract shoppers over Christmas, Bolland stressed that partywear sales rose 36% over the festive period.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap things up for the day. Here's a brief closing summary: \u2022 Tensions are high in Greece following a gun attack on the offices of the New Democracy party in Athens early this morning. Several bullets were fired at the building (see 9.32am) , after a weekend in which other political offices and the homes of several journalists were hit by incendiary devices (9.15am) Greece's prime minister has vowed that democracy will not be 'terrorised' (see 6.04pm). \u2022 IMF chief Christine Lagarde has predicted that the eurozone's recovery will begin this year. (See 8.20am).... \u2022 ...although the latest industrial output data has shown that euro area is probably still in recession (see 10.42am). \u2022 Greek left-wing opposition leader Alexis Tsipras and German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble have disagreed over the eurozone crisis, at a meeting in Berlin. (see 2.14pm). \u2022 Silvio Berlusconi had a mixed day. His party continues to make headway in the polls (see 12.44pm), but efforts to have a sex trial delayed until after the Italian elections was rejected (see 1.37pm). \u2022 European stock markets were calm, while the euro hit its highest level against the pound since last April. (see 1pm). \u2022 David Cameron is to give his speech on Britain in Europe on Friday, in the Netherlands. (see 4.08pm). I'll be back in the morning (snow permitting.....). Until then, thank you and goodnight. And finally, Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras has vowed that democracy will not be threatened by the gun attack on his party's Athens HQ early this morning (see 9.15am onwards for the details). Samaras issued a statement on the attack this evening - and here is a translation into English (with many thanks to Yannis Koutsomitis): A man can be shot just like a building that was shot at today. But Democracy cannot be shot. So those who should, just listen: Democracy cannot be terrorized. Just in - Standard &amp; Poor's has revised up its outlook on Luxembourg and Finland, to AAA/stable from AAA/negative But it left the Netherlands unchanged at AAA/negative, perhaps showing concern over its property debts. Stefan Gerlach, deputy governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, has warned this evening that the recent recovery in Irish government bonds could be swiftly trampled on, if the crisis rears up again. Speaking in Berlin, Gerlach said any 'shock' could send Irish borrowing yields rising sharply, disrupting its goal of exiting its bailout in 2013. Gerlach said: There is ... little, if any, safety margin and even a small adverse shock to market confidence in the Irish Sovereign could complicate the exit from the programme. Any new development leading to a reassessment of euro area risk by financial markets could result in an abrupt reversal of the recent declines in yields. So the crisis may have eased, but it's clearly not consigned to history quite yet.... Irish sovereign debt has been calm today, but Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds have both weakened (after strong rallies in recent weeks). Spain's 10-year bond is trading at a yield of 5.04%, up from 4.89% on Friday night. Italy's 10-year bond is trading at a yield of 4.19%, up from 4.12% on Friday night. David Cameron's speech on Britain's place in Europe will take place on Friday, January 18th, in the Netherlands (The Hague, to be precise). So after all the waiting and speculating, the prime minister's Big Vision on Europe is just four days away. Cameron may now be regretting joshing to political hacks last month that he was taking a 'tantric' approach to European policy, and that the slow, teasing build-up would be worth it.... Spain was dealt a blow by Vodafone today -- the company is planning to cut staff numbers in response to falling demand. According to unions, Vodafone is considering cutting 25% of its Spanish workforce, or around 1,000 people. It has seen revenues fall in Spain (and other struggling Southern European countries) as austerity measures trigger recession and rising unemployment. Bloomberg has more details. And here's Associated Press's take on the meeting today between Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and Alexis Tsipras (see 2.14pm for full details) Germany's finance minister has urged Greece's leftist opposition leader to back the austerity plan attached to the country's international bailout loans. A German government official said Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble held a 30-minute meeting with Alexis Tsipras in Berlin on Monday. He said Sch\u00e4uble insisted the package of austerity measures and reforms agreed by Greece and its international creditors had to be implemented if the country wants to remain one of the 17 nations using the common euro currency. Here's a video clip of David Cameron on morning television today, arguing that Britain is suffering from too much interference from Brussels: Greek left-wing leader Alexis Tsipras and German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble have disagreed over the eurozone crisis at their meeting in Berlin today. Perhaps predictably, the two men remained poles apart over the crisis -- with Tsipras arguing that Greece must change course, and Sch\u00e4uble insisting that it must not. Speaking after the meeting, Tsipras told reporters that he had demanded more action to address Europe's jobless crisis: I told him that the austerity programmes have failed all over Europe and especially in Greece. Now we must deal with their impact: poverty, unemployment. Our vision is to see Greece exiting the crisis with its people standing on their feet. The German finance ministry is briefing that Sch\u00e4uble took a hard line with the Syriza leader, telling Tsipras there was no alternative to austerity and economic reforms for Greece. A ministry source told Reuters: Minister Sch\u00e4uble has told Mr Tsipras unequivocally that there is no alternative to the... implementation of the economic adjustment programme. Minister Sch\u00e4uble urged Mr Tsipras to back the path embarked upon. Just in - Silvio Berlusconi has suffered a setback in the courts: I mentioned at 10.42am that the latest eurozone industrial output data was worse than expected and pointed to a continued recession. Reuters, though, sees signs for optimism: Factory output, two-thirds of which is generated by Germany, France and Italy, was down almost 4% on an annual basis in the month, highlighting just how few cars, televisions and other goods like fridges Europeans have been buying at a time of record unemployment. However, production of machinery used to make other goods, an indicator of future business, rose 0.7% in November from October, after two months of losses. If production of those capital goods continues to increase, that could support business surveys and the view of the ECB that the euro zone will recover from recession in 2013 and that the economy hit bottom in the fourth quarter of last year. The financial markets aren't doing anything to disprove Christine Lagarde's theory that confidence is returning. The French and German markets are up by 0.4% and 0.5% respectively, while the FTSE 100 remains flat. In the currency markets, the euro has hit a new nine-and-a-half-month high against sterling. One pound is now worth \u20ac1.2028, down half a eurocent. Otherwise, experienced hands reports that all is calm and quiet: Silvio Berlusconi continues to dominate the political scene in Italy, with around six weeks to go until the Italian general election. The encouraging news for Berslusconi is that his right-wing coalition has gained ground since his People of Freedom party secured an alliance with the Northern League party, and launched a media charm offensive. The latest polling by the Tecne research institute found that the PdL/Northern League have 24% of the vote, up from 22.4%. Mario Monti's own centrist coalition has fallen back to 14.5%, from 15.8%. The centre-left alliance led by Pier Luigi Bersani remains the lead, but has also lost some ground -- at 37.8 from 38.6%. Berlusconi must also be watching the courts as well as the polls. The latest development there is that Karima El Mahroug, or \"Ruby the Heartstealer\", has made a dramatic return to Italy to give evidence in the former prime minister's sex abuse trial. Berlusconi's lawyer, though, are pushing for the case to be delayed until after February's elections. More here: Silvio Berlusconi's lawyers call for sex trial suspension Here are a couple more photos of the security operation at the offices of New Democracy, following the gun attack in the early hours (see 9.15am onwards). ND officials have said that one bullet shattered a window of an office sometimes used by prime minister Antonis Samaras, ending up on the floor. As Samaras wasn't in the office (and wasn't likely to be either, in the middle of the night), it's important not to exaggerate the attack*. One key question will be whether it represents an escalation in public anger over Greece's austerity programme, or is simply an isolated action by criminal extremists. * - although as someone else might have been, it's hard to ignore In the UK, the question of Britain's possible exit from the European Union continues to rumble on. David Cameron, who is expected to end the suspense and deliver his Big Speech on the issue within days, defended his push for the repatriation of powers on Radio 4's Today Programme. The PM insisted that he doesn't want Britain to leave the EU, and rejected criticism that he's playing a risky game.... Those that say \u2018this is very dangerous, you\u2019re putting at risk the relationship with Europe, you\u2019re putting at risk our position with regard to business\u2019, I don\u2019t agree with that because the fact is this debate is happening anyway. So we have a choice as politicians: do you get out there, lead that debate, make the changes that would be right for Britain \u2013 and I would argue right for Europe \u2013 and then give people a choice about that? Or do you kind of stick your head in the sand and just hope the debate is going to go away? However, Cameron wasn't quizzed on issues such as Brussels' reluctance to renegotiate existing treaties (which might scupper the PM's plan), or reports that an in-out referendum might not be held before 2018 (which would mean years of uncertainty). My colleague Andrew Sparrow has all the details of what was, and wasn't, covered on his Politics Live blog. Industrial output in the eurozone has fallen again, in the latest sign that the region's economy ended 2012 in recession. Euro area industrial output dropped by 0.3% in November, following a 1% fall in October. On a year-on-year basis the sector was 3.7% smaller than in November 2011. Economists had only expected a drop of 0.1% in November. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said the data suggested that the eurozone shrank in the final three months of 2012, for the third quarter in a row: While Eurozone manufacturing activity likely suffered its low point around October, latest survey evidence indicates that the sector is still in recessionary territory and that conditions continue to be tough going into 2013. Archer added, though, that firms could be encouraged to invest more by the current optimistic mood. Back to the financial sector... and the Greek stock market has hit its highest level in 17 months. The main Athens index, the ATG, hit 1000 points this morning for the first time since August 2011. That means its doubled since mid-June, when a Greek exit from the eurozone looked likely. Greece's opposition Syriza party has hit back against the Greek government for claiming that it was linked to the latest wave of violence (see 9.15am). Syriza spokesman Panos Skourletis said the party clearly condemned the attacks. Skourletis then claimed that the governing New Democracy party was trying to make political capital out of the incidents and creating a \"civil war climate.\u201d Here's some reaction from Greek citizens: Here's a photo from Athens of counter-terrorism officers gathering evidence outside the New Democracy (ND) headquarters following this morning's gunfire. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports that the gun attack on that Athens HQ of New Democracy (see 9.15am post) took place at 2.30am local time (00.30am GMT). It also flags up that 17 separate firebombing attacks were reported in Greece on Saturday and Sunday: Several New Democracy and PASOK offices around Athens were also firebombed over the weekend. A total of 17 incendiary attacks, including on a SYRIZA office in Iraklio, Crete, were recorded over the weekend. There is alarm in Greece after bullets were fired at the headquarters of the governing New Democracy party this morning. The attack, reportedly involving a kalashinikov rifke, came after weekend attacks on the homes of several journalists which has left Athens in a state of high anxiety. From the Greek capital our correspondent, Helena Smith, reports: Government officials are expressing consternation at the rash of attacks in recent days following confirmation that bullet casings reportedly fired from a kalashinikov were even found in the office used at New Democracy headquarters by prime minister Antonis Samaras. Police this morning said they were now tracking down a gunman who is believed to have fired the shots from a motorbike at the party's central building on Sygrou Avenue. No one was injured in the assault. \"We are leaving no stone unturned, \" said one police source. \"These appear to be a coordinated range of attacks very possibly by the same group.\" The government spokesman, Simos Kedigoglou, whose own brother was targeted when assailants attacked his central Athens home with a fire bomb over the weekend, said the coalition government would not be cowed by the violence. \"We have a worrying acceleration in the effort to sow terror in our society. We are seeing unprecedented things ... We all have to give our all. To show that democracy will not be terrorized,\" he told a local radio station this morning, before slamming the radical left main opposition Syriza party for condoning \"the political violence.\" The homes of five prominent Greek journalists, employed with national media, were also targeted Friday by a new group calling itself \"lovers of lawlessness.\" The group blamed the journalists \"sympathetic\" coverage of the way the government had handled the country's financial crisis. No one has been arrested, said police, who declared a nationwide hunt for the assailants is now underway. Government officials have openly hinted that the attackers derive from \"anti-bailout\" forces coalesced around the far-left front. With Greeks ensnared in their hardest winter since the eruption of the debt crisis three years ago, anti-austerity anger is palpable. However, several polls also showed a slight dent in support for Syriza with the left-wingers losing their lead in favor of the governing coalition for the first time since the summer. Samaras, who has been credited with deftly steering Greece through an autumn of tumultuous negotiations with the country's troika of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF, also increased his lead over the leftist leader Alexis Tsipras. SKAI TV, which conducted one of the surveys, attributed the rise to the political stability the coalition appeared to have succeeded in attaining with the release of a whopping \u20ac34.4bn in emergency bailout funds last month. In a bid to boost his party's standing within the EU, Tsipras will meet the German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble, in Berlin today for what will be his first talks with a senior official in the Merkel administration. Rumour watch: there's some chatter in the City this morning that Cyprus is about to be downgraded by a ratings agency. If so, it will either be Standard &amp; Poor's or Fitch, given Moody's cut its rating last Thursday. The deadlock over Cyprus's request for financial aid had put its creditworthiness in the spotlight. Over the weekend, finance minister Vassos Shiarly hit back at claims from Germany that the island is a hotbed of money-laundering. Shiarly told Der Spiegel that: Nobody has proved so far that we offend against the rules or even support money laundering.... We see our future as a serious financial centre. That's why we want to be one step ahead of our European partners in financial market regulation in future. (quotes via Reuters - I'm afraid I can't find the interview on the Spiegel website yet....) Christine Lagarde's claim that investor confidence has returned is backed up by new data this morning, showing that the amount of money flowing into global stock markets hit a five-year high last week. Most European stock markets have opened a little higher this morning too: FTSE 100: flat at 6120 German DAX: up 9 points at 7724, + 0.12% French CAC: up 8 points at 3714, + 0.2% Spanish IBEX: up 20 points at 8684, + 0.23% Italian FTSE MIB: up 73 points at 17575, +0.4% Some investors reckon the rally could run until this summer.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other events in the world economy. The head of the International Monetary Fund has reinforced the optimistic mood in the eurozone by declaring that the region's economy is improving. Christine Lagarde predicted that Europe's economy will begin to recover in 2013, in an interview with the BBC World Service broadcast this morning. Lagarde also argued that Greece will show 'better results' than planned, but must make more efforts on tax recovery. She said: We forecast the eurozone to be delivering growth in 2013, which is better than the recession that it has experienced in 2012. There is an improvement, and there is the beginning of recovery. The IMF chief cited regional initiatives to strengthen the single currency, such as the move towards banking union, as well as the measures implemented by individual countries. It's clearly the case that investors are returning to the eurozone, and resuming confidence in that market. While Greece is still expected to suffer another desperately tough year, Lagarde argued that the country might actually outperform over the next 12 months. What technical analysis and the history of crisis management tells us, is that you're better of doing it strong and hard at the beginning in order to reap the benefits of the process Greece has done a huge and massive effort in cutting expenses, in bringing the deficit down, in turning to primary equilibrium if not surplus now -- which is the good news. The country is going to turn out better results than what was even planned - but it has to continue doing a massive effort on collection of revenue and collection of tax. It's interesting to hear Lagarde return to the issue of tax evasion in Greece. Last May, her claim that many Greeks were \"trying to escape tax' sparked a major backlash. You can listen to the full interview here (start at 11.25 minutes in), or watch a video clip here. Lagarde's comments echo the upbeat views expressed by ECB president Mario Draghi last Thursday \u2013 he also predicted that economic activity should \"gradually recover\" this year. Neither Lagarde or Draghi are claiming that the crisis is actually over -- but both appear to genuinely believe that the worst is behind us.... It's hard to see anything disrupting this view today, even though the stumbling progress towards a bailout for Cyprus is a potential roadblock. Here's what's coming up today: \u2022 Left-wing Greek opposition leader Alexis Tsipras is meeting German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble in Berlin \u2022 Eurozone industrial production data for November - 10am GMT As usual, I'll be tracking the latest developments....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As US carmakers gather in Detroit for their annual auto show, Ford's top economist has warned that Washington's failure to tackle its fiscal crisis and Europe's ongoing financial woes still threaten to derail the industry's recovery. Chief economist Ellen Hughes-Cromwick said there were many hopeful signs for the US economy and the car industry, including a recovery in the housing market and once hard-pressed millennials now benefiting from better economic conditions. Addressing the Society of Automotive Analysts, Hughes-Cromwick said the agreement over the fiscal cliff left many questions unanswered, especially about how the US would pay for its spiralling medical costs. \"We are all part of the fiscal debate,\" she said. \"Today we do not have fiscal sustainability. If we do not fix this and pull things together, it will generate a very weak period of economic growth. You think 2% economic growth is weak? That's nothing,\" she warned. President Barack Obama managed to broker a deal over the so-called fiscal cliff budget crisis just before New Year, but Obama faces another challenge in February as Republicans threaten to clash with Democrats once more over the country's borrowing limit. Hughes-Cromwick warned, too, that the situation in Europe was likely to be a drag on the industry for years to come. All the major car companies have been losing cash in Europe as sales have collapsed, and sales in Europe are in their sixth year of decline. \"In Italy we haven't seen sales at these levels in our proprietary database,\" Hughes-Cromwick told the meeting. Jeff Schuster, executive director of LMC Automotive, an industry forecaster, told the meeting that its European car sales were unlikely to return to pre-recession levels before 2019 \u2013 a decade after the economic nadir. Hughes-Cromwick's warning comes as Detroit appears to be firmly on the road to recovery. The auto industry is expected to sell 15-16m units in the US this year, the first time it has reached that level since 2007, and up from a low of 10.4m units in 2009. Luxury cars and larger pickups are attracting all the attention at this year's North American Auto Show, in a sign of returning confidence. \"This is the most upbeat analysts' meeting here I've been to in years,\" said Michelle Krebs, senior analyst at Edmunds.com. Unveiling new cars and SUVs Monday, Volkswagen's US chief executive Jonathan Browning said the \"economic and political waters continue to be unsettled,\" but he predicted another good year for the industry and particularly Volkswagen which last year had its best year in the US since 1973. Krebs said that clear signs of recovery in the housing market were likely to build sales for larger pickup trucks, where the big three US automakers make most of their profits. Ford is unveiling the latest version of its bestselling F-150 truck at the show, and its rivals, too, have big trucks on offer. But Krebs echoed Hughes-Cromwick's concerns about Europe and Washington. \"Everyone thinks that Europe is going to get worse before it gets better and then the fear of contagion is still there. How badly will it hit us over here? \"But the bigger worry is still Washington. If we see another collapse in talks that could hit consumer confidence, sales and the economy. There's so much pent-up demand out there, cars are so old now, but confidence is key.\"",

      "bodyText": "Sensible tax planning or brazen gaming of the system? Most big banks in London, when wondering whether to defer the new year dishing-out of bonuses until the top rate of tax falls from 50p to 45p in April, concluded that the debate wasn't worth having. Enabling the recipient of a \u00a3200,000 bonus to keep an extra \u00a310,000 might be popular internally but re-jigging payment dates would look terrible externally. We won't go there, most decided, concluding that another round of headlines about a self-interested financial elite milking the last drop of their substantial rewards was not the image they were looking to project in the new era of socially conscious banking. Goldman Sachs, though, is different. Chief executive Lloyd Blankfein himself blazed the trail in the US a few weeks ago. He and a few senior colleagues were the beneficiaries of a fleet-footed manoeuvre over the new year \u2013 share-based bonuses, due to be handed out in January, were dispatched on December 31 to dodge a fiscal cliff-related rise in tax rates as the year turned. Goldman's London staff, one can speculate, pointed out that what's good for the goose is good for the gander.

      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs is kickstarting the controversial City bonus season by considering whether to defer bonuses into the new tax year in April \u2013 when the top rate of income tax falls to 45% from 50%. A number of banks are known to have considered whether to make the move, which would save their top employees thousands of pounds. But City sources believe many of them have rejected the idea to avoid any negative publicity in the wake of the row surrounding corporation tax paid by Starbucks in the UK. The Wall Street firm \u2013 which publishes its full year results on Wednesday and tells staff their bonuses for 2012 shortly afterwards \u2013 is not thought to be considering changing the way the bonuses for 2012 are handed out. The proposal being considered would benefit parts of bonuses deferred from the years 2009, 2010 and 2011, which are due to be handed to staff this year in the form of shares. The bank is not thought to have decided whether to press ahead with deferral of the shares early in to the new tax year on 6 April. But it has already attracted attention for paying some deferred bonuses early in the US to avoid a hike in tax rates. The firm paid out about \u00a340m in so-called restricted stock in early January just as the \"fiscal cliff\" budget talks led to taxes being raised \u2013 and despite earlier remarks by Goldman chief executive Lloyd Blankfein that \"tax rises, especially for the wealthiest, are appropriate\". Goldman refused to comment on Sunday night. It is regarded as one of the most generous payers in the City and forecast to have a bill of just over \u00a38bn to pay its staff for 2012, slightly more than 2011 when the average per employee was about \u00a3238,000. Goldman is among a number of major Wall Street players announcing results next week \u2013 along with Citigroup and JP Morgan. In the UK, employees at bailed-out banks Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland will benefit from the lower top tax rate as the bulk of their bonuses are not paid until June at the earliest. This is in line with the pay regime from previous years agreed with UK Financial Investments, which controls the taxpayer stakes in the bailed-out banks and limits cash bonuses to \u00a32,000. The cash bonuses are paid in March but subsequent sums in shares are deferred into June and subsequent months. Deferral of bonuses over at least three years has been demanded by regulators such as the Financial Services Authority as a way to make employees less likely to run huge risks for a single year and to allow banks to claw back any bonuses if performance turns sour. Such clawbacks may be a feature of the bonus season because of the waves of scandal to hit the industry ranging from payment protection insurance mis-selling in the UK to fines for Libor fixing and money laundering.",
