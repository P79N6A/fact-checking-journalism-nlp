      "bodyText": "Companies in Britain\u2019s growing gig economy are forcing workers into bogus self-employment and free-riding on the welfare state, an influential committee of MPs has said. In a damning assessment of modern employment practices, the parliamentary work and pensions committee calls on the next government to bring laws up to date so that workers are better protected from exploitation. Given concerns about the rising number of workers classed as self-employed contractors with no access to sick benefit or holiday pay, it wants the default status for people in the gig economy to be \u201cworker\u201d rather than \u201cself-employed\u201d. In an inquiry now curtailed by Theresa May calling a snap election, the committee questioned companies including Uber, Amazon, Hermes and Deliveroo that use self-employed workers widely. It also heard from their drivers. An abridged report into the committee\u2019s findings on Monday accuses companies of propagating a myth about self-employment and rebuffs their claims to be providing flexibility for workers. The committee, led by the Labour MP Frank Field, criticised such arguments as fiction. It also highlighted that forcing people into self-employment as couriers, taxi drivers and other roles, rather than taking them on as employees, was depriving the state of badly needed tax revenues and creating an extra burden on the welfare system. \u201cCompanies in the gig economy are free-riding on the welfare state, avoiding all their responsibilities to profit from this bogus \u2018self-employed\u2019 designation while ordinary taxpayers pick up the tab,\u201d said Field. \u201cThis inquiry has convinced me of the need to offer \u2018worker\u2019 status to the drivers who work with those companies as the default option. This status would be a much fairer reflection of the work they undertake which seems to fall between what most of us would think of as \u2018self-employed\u2019 or \u2018employed\u2019. It would also protect them from some of the appalling practices that have been reported to the committee in this inquiry.\u201d The committee\u2019s report found self-employment could indeed be \u201cgenuinely flexible and rewarding for many\u201d, but that people on employment contracts were also able to work flexibly. \u201cFlexibility is not the preserve of poorly paid, unstable contractors,\u201d said the report, published ahead of Wednesday\u2019s dissolution of parliament. Field said: \u201cIt is clearly profit and profit only that is the motive for designating workers as self-employed.\u201d The report comes ahead of the government\u2019s Taylor review of modern working practices, which is likely to recommend that self-employed gig economy workers should be granted greater protections and benefits. The MPs\u2019 report will pressure companies further to change staffing practices. It follows an employment tribunal ruling last year that found Uber drivers were wrongly classified as self-employed and should be classed as workers. Uber plans to challenge the ruling in the courts later this year, and in the meantime has sought to quell criticism of its practices. The San Francisco-based ride-hailing firm said last week that it would start to offer its drivers in the UK sickness cover in exchange for a \u00a32 per week fee. Field dismissed Uber\u2019s move, saying the plan was \u201cjust another way of pushing costs onto the workforce\u201d. Uber said: \u201cThe vast majority of drivers who use Uber tell us they want to remain their own boss as that\u2019s the main reason why they signed up to us in the first place. But we know drivers want more security too, which is why we are investing in a heavily discounted illness and injury cover offer for drivers.\u201d The chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced plans to increase those contributions in his maiden budget in March, but was quickly forced into an embarrassing U-turn following a backbench revolt. Monday\u2019s report also notes that self-employed people and employees receive almost equal access to the services funded by national insurance contributions \u201cyet the self-employed contribute far less\u201d. \u201cThe incoming government should set out a roadmap for equalising employee and self-employed national insurance contributions,\u201d it said.",

      "bodyText": "Easier access to mortgages with a small deposit has offered some glimmers of hope for first-time buyers struggling to get on to Britain\u2019s housing ladder, according to a new report. Research on the amount of time it takes to save for a down payment on a home suggests buyers have been helped by the greater availability of mortgage loans at higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. The estate agent Hamptons International said that in the final months of 2016 it would take an average single first-time buyer 11 years and nine months to save a 15% deposit. But reducing the deposit to 10% cut the saving time to eight years and three months. For a deposit of just 5% the time to save was four years. Hamptons highlighted Bank of England figures that suggest such deals with smaller deposits have become more widespread in recent years. The proportion of loans made at a 90% or more LTV ratio was 5% in 2016, up from 3.8% in 2015. Hamptons said that increasing availability of lending at higher LTV, combined with lower mortgage rates, had improved the ability to buy for first-time buyers. That cautious optimism over affordability chimes with other commentators on the housing market who have highlighted recent signs of cooling in price growth as good news for first-time buyers. However, the estate agency cautioned that the fact house prices grew faster than incomes last year meant anyone going for a mortgage with a 15% deposit would have found it harder, not easier, to save for their down payment. The average length of time for a single first-time buyer to save a 15% deposit in the fourth quarter of 2016 was a whole year longer than in the fourth quarter of 2015. \u201cIt still takes an average single buyer nearly 12 years to save a 15% deposit for their first home. That\u2019s a whole year longer than at the end of 2015. But it\u2019s not all bad news,\u201d said Fionnuala Earley, residential research director at Hamptons. \u201cLenders are increasingly offering higher loan-to-value mortgages and the rates charged on them have come down more than for any other mortgage type.\u201d A separate report from chartered surveyor e.surv found that buyers who put down a small deposit were making up an increasing share of the market. Richard Sexton, a director at e.surv, said: \u201cThis is a trend which started at the end of last year and has continued into 2017. Likely buoyed by the number of government schemes and low mortgage rates across the board, small-deposit buyers are growing in strength in today\u2019s mortgage market. \u201cA more first-time buyer oriented market is good news for all as new buyers help start chains and allow others to move up the housing ladder \u2013 vital for a properly functioning property market.\u201d",

Tesco and Morrisons are among retailers to offer UK icebergs for just 50p \u2013 down from a typical supermarket range of between 70p and 75p for US- and Spanish-imported products. The price peaked at \u00a31.19 among some retailers at the height of winter shortages. The UK salad season usually kicks off in mid-May but, thanks to a mild winter and recent warm weather, crops are being harvested earlier than usual. Shoppers can look forward to an early bounty of UK-grown salad leaves and radishes in addition to English-grown asparagus and Jersey royal potatoes. UK shoppers faced shortages of courgettes in January when a continental cold and wet snap hit supplies at a time of peak demand from consumers keen to pursue their new year resolutions to eat more greens. Other produce, including aubergines, celery, green beans, lettuces and tomatoes were also affected, and as prices rocketed some supermarkets were forced to impose rationing to even out supply. Spanish-grown courgettes are still on supermarket shelves but will gradually be replaced by British ones towards the end of the month, followed by homegrown celery. \u201cThis winter, the rains in Spain were quite a pain, as they caused floods that destroyed many of the crops,\u201d said Georgina Reid, Tesco\u2019s buying manager for chilled salads. \u201cNow that our British suppliers are ready to send us their lettuces we will be able to reduce the price for customers as we lessen our reliance on the Spanish supply.\u201d Morrisons is cutting the price of iceberg lettuces to 50p from 75p, and salad tomatoes to 60p from 68p. Early British tomatoes and cucumbers already in store are supplemented with varieties from the continent, particularly Spain and the Netherlands. Andy Atkinson, Morrisons\u2019 customer and marketing director, said: \u201cIt may feel chilly and wet this weekend but better weather is coming, so it\u2019s the right time to crunch prices that help customers to picnic this summer.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s is selling the UK\u2019s first harvest of British radishes, 10 days ahead of schedule, with bunched radishes (with peppery edible leaves as an alternative to rocket or lettuce) on the shelves this week. Typically the first British salad ingredient of the season, the radish season runs from April to October, with the traditional red globe-shaped Celesta variety the first to be ready for harvest. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen demand for radishes increase by 22% in the past year as customers realise how versatile they are,\u201d said Lily Peck, produce product technologist for Sainsbury\u2019s. \u201cA few fresh radishes make a delicious crunchy snack or crudit\u00e9, and their distinctive pinky-red hue adds an Instagram-worthy pop of colour to summer salads.\u201d Waitrose has committed to growing British salad leaves all year round as part of its support for UK farming and to reduce dependence upon imports. Its new greenhouse growing system \u2013 which it says is a UK first and has been in development since 2014 \u2013 allowed it to start selling a UK-grown salad bag in February, three months earlier than the usual May-October season.",

The latest data comes as Beijing attempts to rein in a booming property market and rapid credit growth. Two surveys on Sunday suggested activity in the world\u2019s second largest economy eased back in April. Manufacturing slowed more than expected as demand was hit by government moves to curb risks associated with a run of high borrowing in China. The National Bureau of Statistics\u2019 official purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) of factory activity fell to a six-month low of 51.2 in April from a multi-year high of 51.8 in March.

China\u2019s official PMI report on its services sector also signalled a slowdown in April. That index slipped to 54.0 from 55.1 in March, showing the sector was still expanding at a solid pace as rising living standards continue to buoy consumer spending. The Chinese economy has defied expectations over the first three months of 2017, with GDP growing 6.9%, but economists expect the pace of expansion to ease during the rest of the year as the government continues its efforts to shift from an economic model based on debt-fuelled investment and exports towards a consumer-driven one. Economists are hopeful that the news on growth will remain positive enough so that Chinese authorities are not tempted to ease back on the pace of reform or reach for once-favoured ways of propping up the economy, such as spending on big infrastructure projects and relying on the booming property market. \u201cA steady flow of solid economic data will only reinforce expectations the Chinese authorities can afford to focus their efforts on reducing financial imbalances in the economy rather than supporting the growth rate of the economy itself,\u201d Victoria Clarke, an economist at the bank Investec, said in a research note ahead of the PMI reports.",

      "bodyText": "Repeats are a TV staple, with Captain Mainwaring and Del Boy often on standby if the viewer wants to take a nostalgia trip. But an explosion in the number of scripted TV shows, fuelled by the arrival of deep-pocketed upstarts Amazon and Netflix, has given viewers an unprecedented choice of quality original drama and comedy. With the age-old problem of the barren TV schedule now a thing of the past, the tradition of dredging up reruns of classic shows in times of need could be over. Last month, Sky added to the scripted TV boom with a $250m (\u00a3193m) production joint-venture with HBO, maker of shows including Game of Thrones and Billions, to create a \u201cglobal drama series powerhouse\u201d to compete with Netflix and Amazon. Sky spends more than \u00a33bn a year on non-sport programming \u2013 including buying in shows such as the new Twin Peaks and making its own series such as Fortitude and Guerrilla \u2013 but its budget is still dwarfed by Netflix and Amazon\u2019s combined investment of almost $10bn this year. \u201cWorking with the best producers and making bigger productions ... is increasingly important to reach viewers, especially with high-quality drama,\u201d says Jeremy Darroch, chief executive of Sky, acknowledging that providing viewers with new dramas is a key part of staying competitive in the multichannel world. In the US the number of scripted shows being made annually has more than doubled since 2010 to more than 500 this year. Many of these productions find their way to British TV screens or on-demand services. Netflix recently revealed it has 90 original productions on the go in Europe alone \u2013 Sky has 80 \u2013 and most other UK broadcasters have upped their game in the must-watch TV stakes. \u201cThere is a real passion and energy behind creating more and more scripted shows, especially drama, where there are a lot of [producers] pitching, and viewers are loving it,\u201d says Kate Little, joint managing director of Lime Pictures, the producer of shows including the long-running drama Hollyoaks. \u201cLook at Broadchurch or Line of Duty getting 10 million viewers with catch-up TV included. If you turn the dial back five years that was pretty much unheard of for a drama. What is lovely for viewers is the range: The Replacement, Doctor Foster, The Durrells and Night Manager to House of Cards, Transparent and Game of Thrones. There is a smorgasbord of options catering to every taste.\u201d With an almost nonstop release schedule of new shows to choose from, there is less time for new audiences to discover repeats of older programmes. Little says that with so much choice viewers have little patience for the traditional trawl through the channel guide to find something to watch. \u201cIs the repeat dead? Well quality older shows like Last of the Summer Wine and Vicar of Dibley will still draw an audience for while yet,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you happen to get down the programme guide you might end up turning on Dad\u2019s Army. Equally, you might just flick on a subscription on-demand service instead.\u201d The experience of the owner of the Gold TV channel, home to an endless cycle of repeats of BBC classics such as Only Fools and Horses and Dad\u2019s Army, indicates that audiences may be loyal but they aren\u2019t growing \u2013 or getting any younger. \u201cLook at Gold\u2019s ratings over last 10 years and they have been reasonably flat,\u201d says Darren Childs, chief executive of parent company UKTV, which owns 10 channels in total. \u201cThose types of shows used to run across the whole portfolio of channels, but now they are contained in one single environment, on Gold. It is an important and valuable audience for us but the majority of our growth in viewership is coming from new and original content being commissioned.\u201d UKTV is embracing a Netflix-style approach and ploughing \u00a3150m annually into new shows, with about a third of that on original commissions. Childs says the policy is paying dividends as eight out of 10 of the top shows on Dave are now original content, a big change from the channel\u2019s historical lineup. \u201cHaving access to 50 years of the BBC archive is fantastic for us, but you can\u2019t bet the farm on one single genre,\u201d says Childs. In the vein of out with the old and in with the new, Netflix has commissioned Lime Pictures to make the youth-focused Free Rein, an American teenager\u2019s coming-of-age adventures during a stay at a British riding stables. Little says that the death of the repeat could well boil down to the next generation of viewers and their TV habits. Ofcom research has found that 16- to 24-year-olds in particular have embraced on-demand services, watching about a quarter less traditional broadcast TV than in 2010, and are likely to be on the constant lookout for the new, not the old. \u201cIt is about viewing habits apart from anything else,\u201d she says. \u201cChannels without brand-defining offerings [those built on repeats and old shows] will eventually start to feel the pain more. It could end up being the end of the \u2018repeat\u2019 but not immediately. I\u2019d give it three to five years before [channels showing repeats] start to feel the pinch.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "There is a familiar rhythm to French politics. President gets elected amid a wave of optimism. President says root and branch reform of the economy will lead to stronger growth and falling unemployment. President fails to deliver the promised transformation. Economy continues to struggle. President gets booted out of office. In the past 30 years, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand, Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande have won elections for the mainstream parties of the centre left and centre right but France\u2019s economic problems have not been resolved. It says something about how poor performance has been under Hollande that growth of barely more than 1% in 2016 was good by recent standards. The upshot is that France has lost faith in the old established parties and is increasingly willing to give something new a try. More than 60% of those who voted in the first round of the presidential election voted for self-styled radical outsiders: Marine Le Pen of the radical right; Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon of the radical left; and Emmanuel Macron of the radical centre. Assuming the polls are right, Macron will be president in a week\u2019s time. If he loses to Le Pen on 7 May, it will be a bigger surprise than Brexit or Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election. Macron will then have to deliver on his promises. France\u2019s economic performance in recent years has been underwhelming, especially when compared to that of Germany. Fifteen years ago, the eurozone\u2019s two biggest countries enjoyed comparable living standards. Today, Germany\u2019s are almost a fifth higher than those in France. Likewise, at the time when euro notes and coins were introduced in 2002, French and German unemployment rates were both around 8%. Today, Germany\u2019s unemployment rate has dropped below 4% while French unemployment is close to 10%. Youth unemployment is a particular problem. Almost one in four of those aged under 25 are out of work, a much higher rate than in Germany. Hollande has had some success increasing the number of people in training and he forced through legislation last year making hiring and firing easier. But more than 85% of employment growth last year was for temporary jobs, and the vast majority of those hired were on contracts of less than a month. These are not new problems. From the mid-1990s to the start of the financial crisis in 2007, only Italy among the rich members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has grown less quickly than France. Since the crash, France\u2019s recovery has lagged well behind the US, the UK and Germany. It is not all bad news. France has good productivity, a strong industrial base and levels of inequality similar to those in Germany and the Netherlands, but much lower than in the UK and the US. The employment rate for prime-aged workers \u2013 35- to 54-year-olds \u2013 is higher than it is in the US. Even so, France\u2019s poor economic record has left it with an inferiority complex when it comes to Germany. In part, France\u2019s championing of the single currency in the 1990s was due to its belief that monetary union would dilute Germany\u2019s influence over European economic policy. Germany was always suspicious of the French claim that the single currency would be the catalyst for economic convergence, and so it has proved. The divergence in economic performance has left France in a clearly subservient role and Germany wary of any further integration that will involve it writing blank cheques to the rest of the eurozone. Berlin has grown impatient with the failure of French politicians to deliver on the reforms they have promised. As a result, it is no longer a partnership of equals. Angela Merkel never took Hollande all that seriously. According to Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank, Macron wants two things from Germany. Firstly, he wants Berlin to agree to reflate its domestic economy, thereby helping not just French exporters but those of other EU countries. Secondly, he wants to complete the monetary union project by having a eurozone budget managed by a eurozone parliament and a eurozone finance minister. It would certainly help the other members of the single currency if Germany invested and consumed more. There is also something intrinsically unstable about the euro in its current incomplete form. But getting the Germans to agree to Macron\u2019s proposed changes is not going to be easy. In part, that\u2019s because reforms of the labour market will run into stiff opposition and \u2013 if history is any guide \u2013 will be watered down. But even if Macron does push all his changes through, there is no guarantee that growth will accelerate and unemployment will plummet. And that\u2019s because the assumption is that all France\u2019s problems stem from structural rigidity and the lack of labour market flexibility rather than from inadequate demand. The classic neo-liberal diagnosis is that the French state is too big and needs to be pared back through significant cuts in spending. Likewise, the French unions are too powerful and the unemployed need to price themselves into jobs by working harder for lower wages. This has been the standard explanation of France\u2019s economic woes ever since the abandonment of Keynesianism in the early 1980s. The abiding economic orthodoxy has held that low inflation should be the sole aim of macro-economic policy and should be achieved through control of the money supply; that fiscal policy - changes to tax and spending - is ineffective; and that the economy is a self-adjusting mechanism that will revert to full employment provided prices and wages are flexible. France, in other words, was not giving up anything of real value when it joined the single currency because all that was required was for the European Central Bank to keep inflation low and for politicians in Paris to embark on meaningful structural reform. The Keynesian take on France, by contrast, would be that adjustment to shocks tends not to be automatic but comes through the use of all the main economic levers: interest rates, the exchange rate and fiscal policy. The failure to deploy all these weapons explains why growth in the 12 original members of the eurozone averaged 3.4% a year in the 1970s and 0.1% between 2009 and 2015. Seen from this perspective, Macron does not offer radical centrism but more of the same. By seeing France\u2019s problems as stemming from a lack of supply-side reform rather than from a shortage of demand, he is setting himself up to fail. The difference is that if Macron fails to deliver on his promises, the Front National will be able to mount an even stronger challenge for the presidency in 2022 than it has this time. That\u2019s why the stakes for Macron are so high.",

The present is a bit more prosaic. On Tuesday, Apple\u2019s current dependency on the iPhone is likely to be reinforced when it reports second-quarter results, hence its desire to expand its services businesses. The company is expected to report only a slight year-on-year rise in revenues to about $52bn after a couple of weak quarters, not to mention the first annual decline in iPhone sales last year. And analysts believe Apple\u2019s guidance for the third quarter could be cautious, with JP Morgan forecasting sales of $44.2bn for the three months to June. The problem is that consumers could be keeping their cash in their pockets until the next iPhone arrives (it\u2019s expected in September). Although some reports suggest the new model could be on display at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, there have also been suggestions the September launch may be delayed because of supposed problems with a new edge-to-edge screen. But despite chief executive Tim Cook being unhappy at some of Donald Trump\u2019s actions, notably the recent travel ban, Apple is set to benefit from the president\u2019s tax policies. Trump plans to give incentives to companies who repatriate their large overseas cash holdings, although no details were given at last week\u2019s tax announcement. A \u00a32.6bn loss?

Unfortunately it has been in the wrong direction, with the company\u2019s concentration on educational publishing proving problematic, particularly in the key US market. It reported the biggest loss in its history last year \u2013 some \u00a32.6bn. Still, that didn\u2019t stop Pearson awarding chief executive John Fallon \u2013 who has presided over five profit warnings since taking over from Marjorie Scardino in 2013 \u2013 a 20% increase in his total pay to \u00a31.5m. To the surprise of many, this included a bonus of \u00a3343,000. When the award was announced last month, Sarah Wilson, chief executive of investor advisory service Manifest, said: \u201cMany shareholders are automatically voting against any increased awards and so this will just ratchet up tension.\u201d Something for Pearson investors to consider as they make their way to the company\u2019s annual meeting on Friday. Rolls promises to create more bread Another company which recently recorded the biggest loss in its corporate history, and which is also holding an annual meeting this week, is Rolls-Royce. The aero-engine maker agreed a \u00a3671m settlement in January relating to bribery and corruption charges and this, along with a \u00a34.4bn writedown due to the plunge in sterling, helped push it into a \u00a34.6bn loss for the year. Chief executive Warren East said the write-off was \u201cjust an accounting measure\u201d and did not reflect the underlying health of the business. The company has a target of increasing free cash flow from the current \u00a3100m to \u00a31bn by 2020, which some analysts are unconvinced will happen. Deutsche Bank said: \u201cAlthough we believe much better cash generation lies ahead \u2026 achieving the magic \u00a31bn targeted by management looks to be a stretch too far.

      "bodyText": "When the major oil-producing countries meet in a month\u2019s time at a Vienna hotel, they are expected to extend the production cap that has pushed up the price of oil in recent months. The agreement in December by Opec and Russia to curb production for the first half of 2017 has driven oil prices up near $55 a barrel, offering some respite for an industry hit by a slump in which prices fell as low as $27. Producers have largely stuck to the deal of cutting output by 1.8m barrels a day, with Opec hailing a 98% conformity rate as a sign of \u201csignificant willingness to continue cooperation\u201d. The big question is whether those curbs will be extended for a further three to six months, to prop up prices. It is hard to imagine they won\u2019t \u2013 key player Saudi Arabia has signalled an extension is on the cards, and analysts have warned failure to do so could see prices sink back down to $40 a barrel. While a lower price would be welcome news for motorists filling up their cars, it could hit overdue investment decisions by oil companies. (BP, for instance, said earlier this year that it needs a relatively high price of $60 a barrel to break even.) The UK industry would be less likely to get the \u201curgent\u201d new capital it seeks to fill the hole left by low investment in the North Sea. Cheaper oil would also put even greater pressure on oil-reliant governments struggling with budgets and restless populations. As the International Energy Agency said last week, there are \u201cheightened geopolitical risks in some major [oil] producer countries, such as Venezuela\u201d. The IEA spelled out quite how bad the last two years have been. Global oil discoveries were at a record low in 2016, at 2.4bn barrels compared with an average 9bn barrels over the past 15 years, and the number of projects sanctioned by companies was at a 70-year low. Both trends could continue this year, it warned. One bright spot, depending on your point of view, has been the US. Output is up, and costs are down. There were 857 rigs in operation this month, more than double the amount a year before. As the IEA noted: \u201cGrowth in US shale production has become a fundamental factor in balancing low activity in the conventional oil industry.\u201d It is also a fundamental factor in why Opec wants to continue curbing production. Whatever happens at Vienna in May, the long-term picture for oil firms and major oil-producing countries is grim, according to a new book. Burn Out: The Endgame for Fossil Fuels takes the view that oil prices will not just be \u201clower for longer\u201d, as BP chief Bob Dudley predicted, but lower forever. The evidence for author Dieter Helm\u2019s case rests on plentiful supply unlocked largely by the US shale revolution, \u201cunstoppable\u201d global action on climate change, and technological advances. \u201cMy view is that oil prices will probably carry on falling forever, and $50 is a high price for oil, not low,\u201d the University of Oxford professor told an audience in London last week. Helm described his book as \u201cvery bleak\u201d about the fate of the Middle East\u2019s oil producers, who he warns face challenges \u201cat best uncomfortable and at worst close to existential\u201d. Of Opec, he writes: \u201cThe popular narrative \u2026 assumes that these countries still have the power to move the price, and hence assumes that, eventually, Opec will restore order and return to the good days of ever-higher prices. This narrative is profoundly wrong.\u201d However, Helm is bullish on the US. Donald Trump is a \u201cvery lucky president in energy terms\u201d, because Barack Obama was \u201cthe fossil fuel president\u201d who oversaw a huge increase in oil and gas production and set the country on course to energy independence. On the fundamentals, Helm makes sense. But judging from the cautiously upbeat results presentations of oil and gas giants in recent months, the industry looks unlikely to buy what he see as their best option: \u201charvest and exit\u201d. Draghi\u2019s inflation assurance is uplifting news for Macron Europeans jetting off en masse at Easter helped boost holiday prices, and therefore inflation, across the eurozone this month. But Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, ignored the surge in an inflation rate of 1.9% and a rise in core inflation (which strips out energy prices) to 1.2%, which was the highest level since June 2013. Draghi seems to think this much-needed increase in prices \u2013 which staves off the threat of deflation across the single currency bloc \u2013 is not here to stay. His judgment appeared to be that nonexistent wage growth and low oil prices would push inflation back down again. At the ECB\u2019s monthly meeting, he stressed that underlying inflation remained low and GDP growth steady. The signs of a stronger global recovery and increasing trade suggested foreign demand should add to the economic resilience of the euro area, he added. This will, of course, agitate Germany. Berlin will demand that Draghi starts to withdraw the ECB\u2019s monthly injections of central bank funds \u2013 or quantitative easing \u2013 which Berlin says is pushing inflation up to intolerable levels. But Draghi was having none of it. He insisted that it was too early to withdraw stimulus. At the moment, the 19-member currency bloc is enjoying a goldilocks period that cannot risk being derailed by higher interest rates. Not that Draghi was complacent. With a nod to upcoming elections in France and Germany and possibly the austerity hitting Poland, Hungary and Romania, he said it would be a mistake to ignore growing social unease. It was clear that globalisation had \u201cextraordinary benefits\u201d, he explained, but \u201cit also created losers\u201d. There should be greater social consideration for those who did not benefit, or lose out, he concluded. With a French election looming, it is a message that could excite Marine Le Pen\u2019s supporters and give Emmanuel Macron, her euro-loving rival, a jolt. But the message of steady growth under the stewardship of the euro-elite was the central theme, which gives implicit support to Macron\u2019s stance. Maybe that was the point. M&amp;S\u2019s online trial could make a basket case of Ocado Ocado\u2019s board will not be surprised that Marks &amp; Spencer is moving into its territory by experimenting with online delivery. Ocado\u2019s chairman, Lord Rose, a former chief executive and then chairman of M&amp;S, predicted as long ago as 2013 that his old employer would eventually have to offer a delivery service to meet demand from customers. But Ocado surely won\u2019t welcome M&amp;S\u2019s experiment. Its normal view of online competition is that it all helps to popularise delivery, which works to its advantage over time. But M&amp;S\u2019s arrival may signal something different. M&amp;S is really trying to convert its convenience-first store format to the online world. The economics look tricky for the retailer but Amazon, via its Fresh offer, is trying the same trick. If small basket sizes become popular online \u2013 just as they have in the bricks-and-mortar world \u2013 that spells trouble. Ocado is set up to deliver \u00a3100-plus orders. An M&amp;S delivering \u00a350 orders twice as often could be a serious threat.",

      "bodyText": "The Tim Hortons coffee chain is so inextricably linked to Canadian national identity that the venue for its UK launch this week was obvious: Canada House, in central London. Never mind that the first British outlet will be in Glasgow \u2013 choosing the home of the Canadian high commission to mark its British debut reflects a certain national pride in the brand. \u201cBeing associated with Canada at this particular moment in history is no bad thing,\u201d says the company\u2019s chief marketing officer, Neil Littler. \u201cBut,\u201d he adds, \u201cwe won\u2019t be sticking maple leaves on everything.\u201d While Hortons is an institution in its home country, this may well count for little in the UK, where the high street is dense with competition in the coffee, sandwich and doughnut markets. The chain at least has a signature product to mark it out from the opposition: the Timbit, a small globe of fried dough meant to represent the missing hole in a doughnut. Hortons says, however, that it will focus more on fresh food. \u201cPret a Manger assembles its sandwiches on site, yes, but not in front of the customers,\u201d explains Littler in a nod to one of its biggest UK rivals. Hortons says its expansion will be \u201cnationwide\u201d but is coy about details, aside from identifying its first British outlet. So the mass conversion to Timbits and a cup of Canadian filter will not be immediate, if at all. But the potential prize is big. According to market research firm Mintel, the UK retail coffee market has raced from a value of \u00a3137m in 1997 to \u00a33.4bn by 2016. The market has grown by \u00a31bn alone since 2011. However, wresting a meaningful share of that growth from established rivals will be difficult. Mark Brumby, analyst with leisure industry advisory firm Langton Capital, says the Canadian firm will not find the UK an easy market to crack. \u201cI was in Canada the year before last and [Tim Hortons] is an institution there, but I struggle to see what it\u2019s going to add in the UK that we haven\u2019t got already,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I couldn\u2019t find a coffee shop.\u201d He acknowledges that some players believe the market can expand. \u201cCosta and the others insist there is room for more, they say we don\u2019t drink as much coffee as the Scandinavians, and we don\u2019t. But whether we ever will is the question.\u201d Hortons claims to pour eight out of 10 cups of coffee sold in Canada but it will not repeat that feat in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s competitive in the UK and we\u2019re good at retail and leisure,\u201d says Brumby. \u201cCosts are high and it\u2019s high profile but also high risk. If you don\u2019t succeed, the world is going to see it.\u201d Founded in 1964 by former ice hockey player Tim Horton, who played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, the chain was originally conceived as a kind of diner for baked goods. Ten years later, Horton died in a car accident, and the chain that bore his name went on to win itself a kind of nostalgic respect, along with a dedicated customer base made up of everyone from students to builders to working professionals looking for a cheap lunch. For the last two decades or so, Tim Hortons has doubled down with advertising that ties the chain to another Canadian institution: ice hockey. The Canadian high commissioner to the UK, Janice Charette, inadvertently plays to that image at the launch. \u201cI\u2019m a hockey mom, so for me that meant a lot of mornings in Ottawa piling my children into the minivan and then shivering in the rink with a cup of Tim Hortons.\u201d But that loyalty will not travel far across the Atlantic. Littler, the marketing head, makes much of the response on social media to the announcement, but admits it\u2019s hard to tell how much of the excitement comes from Canadian expats. Gurprit Dhaliwal, chief operation officer at Hortons, stresses that for now they will test the waters in Scotland, where many people have relatives in Canada, before eyeing a rollout to other British cities within a year \u2013 although London is not on the list for now. But how will the company sell itself? Will there be an advertising campaign? \u201cWhen you find out, let me know!\u201d There is a twist to this all-Canadian tale. Tim Hortons is owned by Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (RBI), which is located in Canada but controlled by an ownership structure of Brazilian private equity group 3G and US investment firm Berkshire Hathaway. The Tim Hortons rollout in the UK has been outsourced to SK Group, a franchise operator that helped Domino\u2019s Pizza get a foothold in Britain; Dhaliwal himself runs a Domino\u2019s franchise company with his co-director of Tim Hortons UK &amp; Ireland, Surinder Singh Kandola. Charette admits that there\u2019s something strange about the Canadian embassy hosting a launch event for a company with predominantly US ownership, but says the high commission\u2019s role is not just to encourage Canadian business but Canadian employers, as well as to promote awareness of the country in Britain. \u201cTim Hortons means a lot to Canada,\u201d she says. What it will mean to Britons remains a tricky question.",

Ten years later, Horton died in a car accident, and the chain that bore his name went on to win itself a kind of nostalgic respect, along with a dedicated customer base made up of everyone from students to builders to working professionals looking for a cheap lunch. For the last two decades or so, Tim Hortons has doubled down with advertising that ties the chain to another Canadian institution: ice hockey.</p> <p>The Canadian high commissioner to the UK, Janice Charette, inadvertently plays to that image at the launch. \u201cI\u2019m a hockey mom, so for me that meant a lot of mornings in Ottawa piling my children into the minivan and then shivering in the rink with a cup of Tim Hortons.\u201d<br></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>But that loyalty will not travel far across the Atlantic. Littler, the marketing head, makes much of the response on social media to the announcement, but admits it\u2019s hard to tell how much of the excitement comes from Canadian expats.</p> <p>Gurprit Dhaliwal, chief operation officer at Hortons, stresses that for now they will test the waters in Scotland, where many people have relatives in Canada, before eyeing a rollout to other British cities within a year \u2013 although London is not on the list for now. But how will the company sell itself? Will there be an advertising campaign? \u201cWhen you find out, let me know!\u201d</p> <p>There is a twist to this all-Canadian tale. Tim Hortons is owned by Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (RBI), which is located in Canada but controlled by an ownership structure of Brazilian private equity group 3G and US investment firm Berkshire Hathaway. The Tim Hortons rollout in the UK has been outsourced to SK Group, a franchise operator that helped Domino\u2019s Pizza get a foothold in Britain; Dhaliwal himself runs a Domino\u2019s franchise company with his co-director of Tim Hortons UK &amp; Ireland, Surinder Singh Kandola.</p> <p>Charette admits that there\u2019s something strange about the Canadian embassy hosting a launch event for a company with predominantly US ownership, but says the high commission\u2019s role is not just to encourage Canadian business but Canadian employers, as well as to promote awareness of the country in Britain. \u201cTim Hortons means a lot to Canada,\u201d she says. What it will mean to Britons remains a tricky question.</p>",
