    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vodafone is set to cement its position as the most generous dividend payer on the London Stock Exchange after analysts said it could enjoy a bumper \u00a33bn payout from its US joint venture. The UK company owns a 45% stake in Verizon Wireless, America's largest mobile phone network, which began sharing profits this year after a long hiatus. Verizon's first payment saw $10bn shared by Vodafone and its majority owner, the US broadband company Verizon Communications. This resulted in a \u00a32.8bn taking for Vodafone, of which \u00a32bn was distributed to its shareholders via a 4p dividend in February. The number could rise to \u00a33bn this financial year and to \u00a34bn by 2016, according to broker Liberum Capital. Vodafone is thought to be likely to plough 75% of the taking into its dividend, translating into a 15% rise in the dividend to 4.6p this financial year. \"We expect news shortly that the payment will be repeated at a higher level,\" wrote Liberum analyst Lawrence Sugarman. \"Verizon has material scope to increase its dividend going forward, and crucially, because of the need to fund the Verizon group dividend, has a significant incentive to pay one.\" He believes news is imminent because the resumption of Verizon's dividend was announced in late July last year, a few days after Verizon Communications' half-year results. This year's results are scheduled for 19 July, with Vodafone's a day later. It is understood there is no set pattern, meaning an announcement could come at any time this year. A Vodafone spokesman said the decision lay with the US company. A payout is not a certainty. Last winter, Verizon Communications' management played down suggestions that distributing profits could become a yearly event. Francis Shammo, the group's chief financial officer, said in November he wanted to focus on clearing the mobile network's remaining debts. Verizon Wireless suspended its dividend in 2005 in order to pay down debt, a move that was interpreted by many as designed to freeze Vodafone out of the company so that the US group could assume full control. However, Verizon Wireless generates $1bn in cash each month and its revenues are growing rapidly. Verizon Communications is increasingly dependent on income from its subsidiary to pay down debt and support its own dividend, say analysts. Shammo said on the conference call following his company's results in April that \"our dividend policy is extremely important to us\".",

    "webTitle": "George Osborne's campaign against Ed Balls hit by fresh Libor revelation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A campaign by George Osborne to link Ed Balls to the Libor rate setting scandal ran into trouble on Sunday when it emerged that the cabinet secretary raised concerns about the rate with the Bank of England at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. As Vince Cable, the business secretary, accused banks of \"throttling\" the economic recovery, it emerged that Sir Jeremy Heywood questioned the Bank's deputy governor, Paul Tucker, over the rate as the last government fought to shore up the economy by bringing down the costs of borrowing. The chancellor's campaign against Balls, which involved an unsuccessful trawl for damaging information about him in the City of London last week, will be placed in the spotlight on Monday when Tucker gives evidence to the Treasury select committee. Tucker last week found himself at the centre of the scandal over the fixing of the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) when Barclays released a memo by Bob Diamond, its ousted chief executive, of a conversation with the deputy governor in October 2008. Diamond quoted Tucker as saying that senior Whitehall figures were concerned about the high rate of Libor, a view shared at the time by Osborne's deputy, Philip Hammond. In his evidence to the Treasury select committee, Diamond said that Tucker had meant ministers. But on Sunday Whitehall sources confirmed a report in the Mail on Sunday that Heywood, who was the No 10 permanent secretary in 2008, had raised concerns about the Libor rate with Tucker. A Cabinet Office spokesman said of the claim: \"We have no comment to make.\" However, a Whitehall source said: \"Yes there was contact at that time between Jeremy Heywood [and the Bank]. You would expect that. We were in the midst of the biggest financial crisis in 60 years. There was no conversation about anything improper or irregular \u2026 There was no discussion around the manipulation of interest rates.\" The disclosure of Heywood's role will come as a blow to Osborne who pounced on the Diamond memo to try to link Balls irrevocably to the banking crisis. Hours after the appearance of the memo on Tuesday, the chancellor told the Spectator that allies of Gordon Brown were \"clearly involved\" in attempts to manipulate the Libor rate. He added that Balls had \"questions to answer\". Aides to Osborne said that he never directly linked Balls to the Libor rate scandal and the chancellor had merely said that his counterpart had questions to answer. But his defence was undermined when the Conservative party directly linked Balls to the Libor manipulation. In a note on Wednesday, distributed after Diamond's evidence, the party said that Balls was one of the \"'senior figures' trying to fiddle Libor\". The row over the Libor rate in 2008 came as Cable accused banks of \"throttling\" the economic recovery because of an anti-business culture which focuses on short-term profits. He told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 on Sunday,: \"The real problem at the moment is that the banks \u2013 because of their existing culture, which is frankly anti-business, obsession with short-term trading profits, not focusing on the long term \u2013 are throttling the recovery of British industry.\" Ed Miliband will on Monday announce measures to introduce \"root and branch change\" to the banking industry, including: \u2022 Tackling the bonus culture. The Labour leader says this contrasts with the approach of Osborne who will this week raise objections to new EU rules on bonuses. \u2022 Breaking the dominance of the five main high street which would be forced to sell up to 400 branches. This would take the total sale of branches to around 1,000 because Lloyds is selling 650 branches to the Co-operative Bank. This would allow two new \"challenger banks\", run by the private sector, to offer more choice and lower charges. \u2022 Creating a British investment bank to improve lending to small businesses. \u2022 Setting up a financial crime unit at the Serious Fraud Office \"so that our country is no longer a soft touch for white collar crime\". \u2022 Implementing in full the Vickers report which called for a ring-fencing of retail banking from investment banking. Miliband will say: \"Today I am going to tell you what a better banking system would look like. I will describe the first steps towards moving from the casino banking we have to the stewardship banking we need. \"It will mean root and branch change for our banks if we are to deliver real change for Britain, if we are to rebuild our economy so it works for working people, and if we are to restore trust in a sector of our economy worth billions of pounds and hundreds of thousands of jobs to our country.\"",

KPMG partner Bernard Brown said: \"The latest recruitment data comes as a sobering reminder that we're far away from a confident economic situation. \"Indeed, with both permanent and temporary appointments declining at the sharpest rate in nearly three years and overall demand for staff showing the weakest growth since the start of 2012, the outlook would appear bleak \u2026 A real worry for me is the acceleration in the pace of decline, which suggests this isn't a mere blip. \"If this trend were to continue, there's a very real chance we could hit a 3 million unemployed figure in the UK in the not too distant future.\" Last month's jobless total was 2.61 million, an unemployment rate of 8.2%. The jobs data emerges as the latest monthly poll of polls conducted by accounting group BDO shows UK business confidence at its weakest point this year, while a survey of finance directors by accountants Deloitte reveals the sharpest decline in corporate confidence since the firm began polling in 2007. BDO's Optimism Index \u2013 which predicts business performance two quarters ahead \u2013 has hit a six-month low, falling for the fourth consecutive month from 95.5 in May to 93.5 in June. It is the first time since January it has stood below the 95.0 mark that indicates growth. BDO's Peter Hemington said: \"The figures point to a tough economic climate for the remainder of the year, possibly beyond. Since half our export goods go to the eurozone, it's not surprising that turbulence there is denting longer-term growth prospects here.\" Meanwhile, the Deloitte report, which gauged the views of 137 chief financial officers (CFOs) and finance directors, said that worries about recession and a breakup of the euro are hurting confidence. Ian Stewart, Deloitte's chief economist, said: \"Uncertainty has had a corrosive effect on risk appetite and 80% of CFOs say this is not a good time to take risk on to their balance sheets\". The gloomy surveys emerge after business secretary Vince Cable said on Sunday the economic recovery is being throttled by \"anti-business\" banks. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: \"Banks, because of their existing culture, which is frankly anti-business \u2026 are actually throttling the recovery of British industry. While [the Libor] debate was going on last week, I was appalled as I was going around firms in the north of England \u2013 super companies which have big export potential, got orders \u2013 and they just can't get a loan from the bank to finance their exports and expansion.\"",

      "bodyText": "The fifth anniversary of the start of the financial crisis is approaching and is being marked by concerted action to prevent a fresh downward lurch in the global economy. Interest rates have been cut in the eurozone and in China; the Bank of England has announced it will pump another \u00a350bn into the UK economy; the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is trying to generate lower long-term borrowing costs, and will probably not leave the stimulus measures at that. It seems like a good time to take stock of where things stand, and how events might unfold over the coming months. The first thing to say, perhaps surprisingly, is that it could have turned out a lot worse. To be sure, this has been a long, drawn-out crisis. Output has fallen and unemployment has risen. Most certainly, it has taken much longer than was envisaged to repair the damage to the financial system. But there has not been a second Great Depression or anything like it. Between the Wall Street Crash and the bottom of the slump in 1933, the US economy contracted by 27% and the jobless total rose above 25%. Nothing remotely comparable has happened this time. A second conclusion is that the outcome could \u2013 and almost certainly would \u2013 have been a lot worse had it not been for the decisive action by policymakers. There has been a lot of debate in the past couple of weeks about the manipulation of market interest rates by Barclays and other UK banks, and what Gordon Brown's government did or didn't do to encourage this practice in the autumn of 2008. Most of this discussion has taken place without reference to the financial and economic conditions of the time, which were chaotic and scary. So bad were things on the weekend that the British government put public money behind RBS and Lloyds that the country was within hours of shutting down its cash machines. Paul Ormerod, in his fascinating new book, Positive Linking, gives a good and fair description of how policymakers in the US responded to the crisis. The first thing they did was realise that all the ideas peddled by mainstream economics were utterly useless and had to be junked. What had happened over the previous 30 years was that the economics profession had created models of the world based on the assumption that people made rational decisions after sifting all the options available. At the big picture, or macroeconomic level, every central bank worth its salt had a model of the economy that only worked if one representative agent could be deemed to represent every individual, firm, government, or international body operating in the economy. But in the last few months of 2008, policymakers started making decisions based on what the world was actually like, rather than they way it should be according to their dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models \u2013 the official name for the computer programs used by central banks to make their forecasts. Ormerod argues that it was the US authorities that saved the world, and they did so by trial and error and by relying on knowledge of how policy failures in the 1930s had led to the Great Depression. \"They knew it was impossible to work out the optimal strategy\" he says. \"So they tried things which seemed reasonable and, quite literally, hoped for the best.\" One such experiment, the decision to allow Lehman Brothers to collapse, was a disaster that threatened to bring down the entire western banking system, so, without pause for thought, the US authorities discarded laissez-faire in favour of intervention. They nationalised the mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; in effect nationalised the giant insurance firm AIG; eliminated investment banks; forced mergers of huge retail banks; and guaranteed money-market funds. Ormerod says: \"It was not a grand plan, nor did one ever exist. This was a process of people responding to events on the basis of imperfect knowledge and experimenting to discover what did and didn't work, desperately trying to restore confidence across financial networks.\" The point of Ormerod's book is to show how such networks matter. When a video goes viral on YouTube or a book flies off the shelves, it is not because each of us has come to a rational decision after weighing up all the alternatives. Instead, we copy what other people are doing. In the context of economic policy, Ormerod says the key is to create network effects that provide confidence that the sky is not about to fall. The Americans achieved this in 2008-09; the Europeans have never managed to pull off the same trick during the sovereign debt crisis. \"Confidence across networks was key,\" Ormerod says of the US action. \"Confidence across networks of financial institutions that the monies owed to them by others would be paid. Confidence across networks of commercial companies that output was not about to collapse like it did in the 1930s, so that they would not then act in ways which made this a self-fulfilling prophecy. And confidence across networks of individuals that their worlds were not about to fall apart.\" Unfortunately, a third thing we have learned in the past five years is that averting disaster is not the same as guaranteeing a return to business as usual. British companies are sitting on a cash pile of \u00a3700bn \u2013 equivalent to half the economy's national output \u2013 but they are reluctant to spend it on new investment. They might no longer be fearful about a return to the 1930s, but equally they are not sure that demand will pick up soon. That explains why the Bank of England is continuing to experiment with ideas such as funding for lending, under which banks will be offered lower-cost finance provided they pass the benefits on to their personal and business customers. As in 2008, policy is being governed by rule of thumb, and if funding for lending doesn't work the Bank will have to try something else. Optimism is the default setting for western capitalism. As Daniel Kahneman notes in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, we have an inbuilt optimism bias that makes us view the world as more benign than it actually is. Optimism is normal and healthy, he says, but can be a risk as well as a blessing because it tends to lead us to exaggerate our ability to predict the future. \"The evidence suggests that an optimistic bias plays a role \u2013 sometimes the dominant role \u2013 whenever individuals or institutions voluntarily take on significant risks.\" Clearly, this was what happened in the years leading up to the crisis, but the optimism bias has now been replaced by a pronounced pessimism bias. Lasting recovery will only come when that pessimism bias is eradicated, and it is proving tough to shift. A change in mood could happen at any time, in which case activity will pick up far more quickly than anybody currently expects. But that could be my optimism bias talking.

      "body": "<p>The fifth anniversary of the start of the financial crisis is approaching and is being marked by concerted action to prevent a fresh downward lurch in the global economy. Interest rates have been cut in the eurozone and in China; the Bank of England has announced it will pump another \u00a350bn into the UK economy; the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is trying to generate lower long-term borrowing costs, and will probably not leave the stimulus measures at that.</p> <p>It seems like a good time to take stock of where things stand, and how events might unfold over the coming months.</p> <p>The first thing to say, perhaps surprisingly, is that it could have turned out a lot worse. To be sure, this has been a long, drawn-out crisis. Output has fallen and unemployment has risen.</p> <p>Most certainly, it has taken much longer than was envisaged to repair the damage to the financial system. But there has not been a second Great Depression or anything like it. Between the Wall Street Crash and the bottom of the slump in 1933, the US economy contracted by 27% and the jobless total rose above 25%. Nothing remotely comparable has happened this time.</p> <p>A second conclusion is that the outcome could \u2013 and almost certainly would \u2013 have been a lot worse had it not been for the decisive action by policymakers. There has been a lot of debate in the past couple of weeks about the manipulation of market interest rates by Barclays and other UK banks, and what Gordon Brown's government did or didn't do to encourage this practice in the autumn of 2008.</p> <p>Most of this discussion has taken place without reference to the financial and economic conditions of the time, which were chaotic and scary. So bad were things on the weekend that the British government put public money behind RBS and Lloyds that the country was within hours of shutting down its cash machines.</p> <p>Paul Ormerod, in his fascinating new book, Positive Linking, gives a good and fair description of how policymakers in the US responded to the crisis. The first thing they did was realise that all the ideas peddled by mainstream economics were utterly useless and had to be junked.</p> <p>What had happened over the previous 30 years was that the economics profession had created models of the world based on the assumption that people made rational decisions after sifting all the options available. At the big picture, or macroeconomic level, every central bank worth its salt had a model of the economy that only worked if one representative agent could be deemed to represent every individual, firm, government, or international body operating in the economy.</p> <p>But in the last few months of 2008, policymakers started making decisions based on what the world was actually like, rather than they way it should be according to their dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models \u2013 the official name for the computer programs used by central banks to make their forecasts.</p> <p>Ormerod argues that it was the US authorities that saved the world, and they did so by trial and error and by relying on knowledge of how policy failures in the 1930s had led to the Great Depression. \"They knew it was impossible to work out the optimal strategy\" he says. \"So they tried things which seemed reasonable and, quite literally, hoped for the best.\"</p> <p>One such experiment, the decision to allow Lehman Brothers to collapse, was a disaster that threatened to bring down the entire western banking system, so, without pause for thought, the US authorities discarded laissez-faire in favour of intervention. They nationalised the mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; in effect nationalised the giant insurance firm AIG; eliminated investment banks; forced mergers of huge retail banks; and guaranteed money-market funds.</p> <p>Ormerod says: \"It was not a grand plan, nor did one ever exist. This was a process of people responding to events on the basis of imperfect knowledge and experimenting to discover what did and didn't work, desperately trying to restore confidence across financial networks.\"</p> <p>The point of Ormerod's book is to show how such networks matter. When a video goes viral on YouTube or a book flies off the shelves, it is not because each of us has come to a rational decision after weighing up all the alternatives. Instead, we copy what other people are doing. In the context of economic policy, Ormerod says the key is to create network effects that provide confidence that the sky is not about to fall. The Americans achieved this in 2008-09; the Europeans have never managed to pull off the same trick during the sovereign debt crisis.</p> <p>\"Confidence across networks was key,\" Ormerod says of the US action. \"Confidence across networks of financial institutions that the monies owed to them by others would be paid. Confidence across networks of commercial companies that output was not about to collapse like it did in the 1930s, so that they would not then act in ways which made this a self-fulfilling prophecy. And confidence across networks of individuals that their worlds were not about to fall apart.\"</p> <p>Unfortunately, a third thing we have learned in the past five years is that averting disaster is not the same as guaranteeing a return to business as usual. British companies are sitting on a cash pile of \u00a3700bn \u2013 equivalent to half the economy's national output \u2013 but they are reluctant to spend it on new investment. They might no longer be fearful about a return to the 1930s, but equally they are not sure that demand will pick up soon.</p> <p>That explains why the Bank of England is continuing to experiment with ideas such as funding for lending, under which banks will be offered lower-cost finance provided they pass the benefits on to their personal and business customers. As in 2008, policy is being governed by rule of thumb, and if funding for lending doesn't work the Bank will have to try something else.</p> <p>Optimism is the default setting for western capitalism. As Daniel Kahneman notes in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, we have an inbuilt optimism bias that makes us view the world as more benign than it actually is. Optimism is normal and healthy, he says, but can be a risk as well as a blessing because it tends to lead us to exaggerate our ability to predict the future. \"The evidence suggests that an optimistic bias plays a role \u2013 sometimes the dominant role \u2013 whenever individuals or institutions voluntarily take on significant risks.\"</p> <p>Clearly, this was what happened in the years leading up to the crisis, but the optimism bias has now been replaced by a pronounced pessimism bias. Lasting recovery will only come when that pessimism bias is eradicated, and it is proving tough to shift.</p> <p>A change in mood could happen at any time, in which case activity will pick up far more quickly than anybody currently expects. But that could be my optimism bias talking.</p> <p><em>Positive Linking by Paul Ormerod is published by Faber &amp; Faber</em></p>",
