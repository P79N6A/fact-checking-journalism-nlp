Diffident and soft-spoken, the 55-year-old\u2019s wow factor is limited to a wardrobe of colourful corduroys and a trademark yellow and black scarf. In person he is amiable, low-key and professorial, the embodiment of the academic he has been for the past 30 years. It is a world away from untrammelled narcissism, of which the maverick finance minister has been accused. Tsakalotos was born in Holland and raised in the UK, the son of a prominent Greek family who sent him to the exclusive London private school St Paul\u2019s. He relocated to Athens with his British wife in the early 90s after teaching economics at Kent University.

As the new point man who will coordinate face-to-face contact between Athens and its creditors, Tsakalotos is likely to be methodical, detail-oriented and tenacious. His leftist views, adopted at Oxford where he belonged to the student wing of Greece\u2019s euro communist party, were honed in the anti-globalisation movement. Like Varoufakis, who officials say will continue to have the last say in policy, Tsakalotos supports eurozone membership but is adamantly against the implementation of further recessionary measures that will deepen the country\u2019s economic death spiral. While he concedes the new Syriza-led government has made the mistakes that come with inexperience, he also says the administration has learned from them. Tsakalotos believes the anti-austerity government speaks for the growing numbers across Europe who, subjected to the brutal vagaries of the market, feel excluded from decision-making. \u201cWe are only more radical in the sense that we have been influenced by the anti-globalisation movement and believe in concepts of participatory democracy,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe angst Syriza has caused is down to us challenging a system that can\u2019t actually represent the interests of ordinary people.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Greek finance minister denies being sidelined from debt talks", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Greek finance minister has denied that he has been sidelined from talks with Greece\u2019s creditors on Tuesday as he resumed outspoken attacks on the country\u2019s eurozone partners. Preserving his reputation for combativeness, Yanis Varoufakis chastised eurozone governments for failing to honour their promises and rubbished reports that he would no longer be participating in negotiations to avert the bankruptcy of Europe\u2019s most indebted state. Speaking to reporters as he arrived for work on his motorbike, Varoufakis said: \u201cWhen we shake hands and say this means A and not B, it means A and not B. Unfortunately, the other side has not shown such an attachment to keeping its word. It seems that in Europe we all need to try more to restore confidence.\u201d After three months of turbulent talks, and with cash reserves running perilously low, Greece\u2019s leftist-led coalition reshuffled its negotiating team on Monday. In a move that was interpreted as the beginning of the finance minister\u2019s political demise, it was announced that the British-educated economist, Euclid Tsakalotos, would be the pointman between Athens and foreign lenders at the EU, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But asked if the government\u2019s move would mean he would be less visible, Varoufakis shot back with a rhetorical: \u201cThe finance minister? The man who is responsible for the political negotiating group?\u201d Greece\u2019s eurozone creditors, however, are hopeful the reshuffle will make a difference. \u201cIt should be helpful,\u201d said an EU official involved in the negotiations with Greece. He ascribed the apparent sidelining of Varoufakis to the fiasco in Latvia last Friday when several eurozone countries roundedon the Greek finance minister, who then made matters worse by tweeting about being the target of eurozone \u201chatred\u201d. In Brussels the new team named by the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, was viewed as \u201cmoderate\u201d and \u201csensible\u201d. Officials welcomed the greater involvement of Giorgos Houliarakis, an ally of the pragmatic deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis. Houliarakis has been involved in much of the talks with the so-called \u201cBrussels Group\u201d of financial technocrats doing the spadework on the conditions for resuming lending to Greece. Athens is seeking a life-saving \u20ac7.2bn in further funding before seeking a third bailout this summer. Regardless of the substance of his arguments, Varoufakis has been deemed a disaster in the negotiations by his counterparts. What started as a clash between a new leftwing anti-austerity government in Athens and German fiscal hawks in February quickly spread into Greek isolation ranged against the other 18 countries of the eurozone, largely because of what was seen as know-it-all grandstanding by Varoufakis. \u201cThey made every mistake in the book,\u201d said a senior EU diplomat. \u201cThey solidified eurozone opinion behind the Germans. Everything that Varoufakis has done has been calculated to alienate.\u201d However, Tsipras voiced support for Varoufakis on Monday, describing him as \u201can important asset\u201d for his Syriza party-led administration. A passionate opponent of austerity, Varoufakis has set the agenda for bailout talks since the radical leftists assumed power in January. \u201cI will admit that there is a negative climate,\u201d Tsipras said. \u201cYanis Varoufakis is an important asset for the government and the country. He has annoyed [people] because he speaks the language of finance ministers, of economics, better than they do.\u201d Now that negotiations were in their final phase, criticism was only to be expected, Tsipras said. \u201cNow that we are in the final stretch, we need to reorganise our teams in order to have full control and the best effectiveness possible,\u201d he said. Government insiders insisted the reshuffle was tantamount to window-dressing, aimed at placating the bodies that had blamed Varoufakis for the lack of headway. Among those critics were the head of the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, and the European Central Bank. The ECB was also singled out for criticism by the Greek premier. Greece\u2019s pressing liquidity problem, he said, had been exacerbated by the ECB\u2019s \u201cpolitically and ethically unorthodox\u201d decision to prohibit the country issuing short-term government debt. On Tuesday Dijsselbloem hit back saying Athens should not have been surprised by the ECB\u2019s move. \u201cThe Greek government gambled that if it negotiated with us, the ECB would open its cashier windows, relax the rules,\u201d the Dutchman said in a television interview. \u201cThere will be no easy access to the ECB\u2019s windows until there is a solid agreement with the Eurogroup.

Unfortunately, the other side has not shown such an attachment to keeping its word. It seems that in Europe we all need to try more to restore confidence.\u201d</p> <p>After three months of turbulent talks, and with cash reserves running perilously low, Greece\u2019s leftist-led coalition reshuffled its negotiating team on Monday.</p> <p>In a move that was interpreted as the beginning of the finance minister\u2019s political demise, it was announced that the British-educated economist, Euclid Tsakalotos, would be the pointman between Athens and foreign lenders at the EU, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>But asked if the government\u2019s move would mean he would be less visible, Varoufakis shot back with a rhetorical: \u201cThe finance minister? The man who is responsible for the political negotiating group?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1308a98ab7a2ab4c14953900e024fe224e28ece3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1308a98ab7a2ab4c14953900e024fe224e28ece3/0_102_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Euclid Tsakalotos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greece\u2019s alternate foreign minister, Euclid Tsakalotos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Greece\u2019s eurozone creditors, however, are hopeful the reshuffle will make a difference. \u201cIt should be helpful,\u201d said an EU official involved in the negotiations with Greece. He ascribed the apparent sidelining of Varoufakis to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/24/time-is-running-out-for-greece-says-eurogroup-chief-jeroen-dijsselbloem\">fiasco in Latvia</a> last Friday when several eurozone countries roundedon the Greek finance minister, who then made matters worse by tweeting about being the target of eurozone \u201chatred\u201d.</p> <p>In Brussels the new team named by the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, was viewed as \u201cmoderate\u201d and \u201csensible\u201d. Officials welcomed the greater involvement of Giorgos Houliarakis, an ally of the pragmatic deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis. Houliarakis has been involved in much of the talks with the so-called \u201cBrussels Group\u201d of financial technocrats doing the spadework on the conditions for resuming lending to Greece. Athens is seeking a life-saving \u20ac7.2bn in further funding before seeking a third bailout this summer.</p> <p>Regardless of the substance of his arguments, Varoufakis has been deemed a disaster in the negotiations by his counterparts. What started as a clash between a new leftwing anti-austerity government in Athens and German fiscal hawks in February quickly spread into Greek isolation ranged against the other 18 countries of the eurozone, largely because of what was seen as know-it-all grandstanding by Varoufakis.</p> <p>\u201cThey made every mistake in the book,\u201d said a senior EU diplomat. \u201cThey solidified eurozone opinion behind the Germans. Everything that Varoufakis has done has been calculated to alienate.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c7af61830e448ca75832457ce24194cd8ebf85b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c7af61830e448ca75832457ce24194cd8ebf85b/0_212_3964_2379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis Tsipras\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexis Tsipras, who insists Varoufakis is an \u2018important asset\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, Tsipras voiced support for Varoufakis on Monday, describing him as \u201can important asset\u201d for his Syriza party-led administration. A passionate opponent of austerity, Varoufakis has set the agenda for bailout talks since the radical leftists assumed power in January. <br></p> <p>\u201cI will admit that there is a negative climate,\u201d Tsipras said. \u201cYanis Varoufakis is an important asset for the government and the country. He has annoyed [people] because he speaks the language of finance ministers, of economics, better than they do.\u201d</p> <p>Now that negotiations were in their final phase, criticism was only to be expected, Tsipras said. \u201cNow that we are in the final stretch, we need to reorganise our teams in order to have full control and the best effectiveness possible,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Government insiders insisted the reshuffle was tantamount to window-dressing, aimed at placating the bodies that had blamed Varoufakis for the lack of headway. </p> <p>Among those critics were the head of the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, and the European Central Bank. The ECB was also singled out for criticism by the Greek premier.</p> <p>Greece\u2019s pressing liquidity problem, he said, had been exacerbated by the ECB\u2019s \u201cpolitically and ethically unorthodox\u201d decision to prohibit the country issuing short-term government debt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4454932d-4122-4848-84ba-36c3bd7cafdc\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430243939920/980fdf1d-3e77-426f-8c8c-e4d98f745ec0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Graffiti by Greek street artist Achilles is seen on a wall of an abandoned house in central Athens, on Wednesday, April 22, 2015.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graffiti by Greek street artist Achilles in central Athens.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has appointed one of its own executives to run Williams &amp; Glyn, the branch network that is being spun out of the bailed-out bank, replacing the banker who led the successful bid to buy it. John Maltby, a former executive at Lloyds Banking Group, led the consortium backed by the Church of England that was selected in September 2013 to take control of the 314 RBS branches being repackaged as W&amp;G. But he is now being replaced by RBS executive Jim Brown, who currently runs the Ulster Bank bank division of the 79% taxpayer-owned bank. It was not clear who will replace Brown, who is credited with turning Ulster Bank back to profit last year for the first time since the 2008 crisis. Maltby led the bid for W&amp;G on behalf of a consortium put together by private equity firms Corsair Capital \u2013 where former Standard Chartered boss Lord Davies is vice-chairman \u2013 Centrebridge and RIT, the fund manager run by Lord Rothschild. The Church of England\u2019s Church Commissioners fund also backed the bid for the branches, which must be sold off under the terms of RBS\u2019s bailout in 2008. The sale was supposed to be completed by now but was delayed after Santander bank pulled out of buying the branches. The aim is to float W&amp;G on the stock market, although this is not expected to be completed until the second half of 2016. The transaction is structured intricately.

      "bodyText": "Mixed company results, uncertainty ahead of the UK general election and - more immediately - the latest comments from the US Federal Reserve on interest rates due on Wednesday combined to send shares sharply lower. So despite some optimism that Greece could resolve its financial crisis, now its negotiating team has been restructured, investors remained cautious. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 73.45 points or 1.03% at 7030.53 Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 1.89% to 11,811.66 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.81% down at 5173.38 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.15% to 23,532.09 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.28% at 11,607.7 But the Athens market added 1.41% to 806.01 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 50 points or 0.28%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Hopes that a deal between Greece and its creditors can be done before the country runs out of cash continue to support the country\u2019s bonds: Here\u2019s our story on the Iranian ship situation: And it now appears the ship supposedly seized by Iran was not American after all: Back with Greece and the head of the Eurogroup has said that the shake-up of Greece\u2019s negotiating team would not by itself resolve the impasse between the country and its creditors, and it would still need new loans. Jeroen Dijsselbloem said: Without further loans, Greece won\u2019t make it, that\u2019s the reality. Reuters has the story: Dijsselbloem said in a television interview it may be of some help that the Greeks have appointed a single contact person for negotiations, with Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis apparently sidelined. But he said there had been little progress in negotiations over the past two months, and signalled he did not think a Greek referendum on a deal with creditors would be a good idea. Tsipras has said he may submit an eventual deal to the Greek people for approval if its terms are contrary to the platform he campaigned on. \u201cIt would cost money, it would create great political uncertainty, and I don\u2019t think we have the time,\u201d Dijsselbloem said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think the Greeks have the time for it.\u201d The Dutchman said it should not have come as a surprise to Greece\u2019s government that the European Central Bank has not relaxed limits on how much Greek government debt its banks may use as collateral. \u201cThe Greek government gambled that if it negotiated with us the ECB would open its cashier windows, relax its rules,\u201d Dijsselbloem said. But \u201cthere will be no easy access to the ECB\u2019s windows until there\u2019s a solid agreement with the Eurogroup,\u201d he told RTL Nieuws. \u201cThat\u2019s been made clear to them time and time again.\u201d Sentiment in the markets has not been helped by unconfirmed reports that Iran has seized a US ship... The disappointing US consumer confidence figures have sent markets sharply lower - even lower than they were. Worries about the state of the US economy have been revived by these latest figures, another set of weak data. But with the US Federal Reserve still keen to raise interest rates when it can, there are now conflicting views on the way ahead. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be slightly dismayed at the lower than expected consumer confidence figures released today. Most observers had predicted the levels of consumer confidence to rise, but gasoline prices that are steadily ticking upwards appear to have taken their toll. Though an interest rate rise is still on the cards for the world\u2019s biggest economy, US GDP is forecast to have slowed in the first quarter, which is posing more questions than answers. Yellen will have to wait and see before acting on interest rates. The news has sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down around 90 points, while the FTSE 100 has dropped below 7000 and is currently around 107 points lower at 6996. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 255 points or more than 2% but the Athens market is holding on to its gains, up 2% on hopes a deal could finally be reached with the country\u2019s creditors. Away from Greece, and as the Federal Reserve begins its two day meeting, US consumer confidence has come in lower than expected. According to the Conference Board, the confidence index was 95.2 in April, much lower than the forecast of 102.5 and down from 101.4 in March. Inflation rate expectations were the lowest since February 2007. A quick recap. Another day, another deadline... This time analysts are pencilling in May 9th as a crunch day for Greece, after prime minister Alexis Tsipras claimed Athens could reach an agreement with its creditors by the end of next week. Greek bonds have strengthened today, on hopes of a deal. The yields on its two-year bonds has dropped sharply to 20.3%, from 22.8% last night. The odds of a Greek default have fallen too. Tsipras has also ignited talk about a possible referendum, after warning that he can\u2019t sign up to a deal that breaches the promises that brought him to power. Many economists think a deal be reached in time But Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence explains there\u2019s a 45% that capital controls could be imposed first: The eurozone has also been digesting yesterday\u2019s reshuffle of Greece\u2019s negotiating team, which has reined in finance minister Varoufakis. EU Commission spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt told reporters that talks \u201chave intensified\u201d since Friday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, where Greece was heavily criticised for lack of progress. Negotiations \u201care being made more productive and efficient\u201d, she added. Austria\u2019s finance minister has said he hopes the shake-up will spur Greece onto a deal. Varoufakis, meanwhile, has announced plans for a new tax amnesty for Greeks with money held in Swiss banks. And in the UK, growth has slowed sharply to just 0.3%, weaker than expected: Yanis Varoufakis has announced plans to encourage Greeks to declare assets held in Switzerland to avoid tax. After seemingly having his wings clipped yesterday, Varoufakis been cracking on with the nitty-gritty work of being a finance minister. This includes a meeting Switzerland\u2019s deputy minister for International Financial Affairs, Jacques de Watteville. And speaking to reporters afterwards, Varoufakis said the Athens government would launch an amnesty for undeclared foreign assets, reportedly to be taxed at just 15%. It\u2019s not the first time Greece has tried such a measure, though; success has been limited to date. There\u2019s a lot of chatter today that Greece could be heading towards a referendum. Alexis Tsipras lit the speculation during last night\u2019s TV interview, when he explained voters had not given him permission to sign up to the old bailout programme. He said: \u201cIf the solution falls outside our mandate, I will not have the right to violate it, so the solution to which we will come to will have to be approved by the Greek people.\u201d And with Tsipras ruling out fresh elections, and Germany insisting that Greece meets its commitments, a referendum could indeed be needed. The PM could potentially find that he can\u2019t get a deal past his own Syriza colleagues, if it includes labour market reforms or privatisations that they campaigned against in January\u2019s general election. However, it\u2019s not a simple issue. The Greece constitution allows referendums for matters of critical national interest, and social issues, but not on fiscal matters. And of course, does Greece have time to organise a referendum before running of cash? Greek bonds are continuing to rally, on optimism that a deal will be reached to avert the danger of default: Just in -- photos of Yanis Varoufakis following a meeting with Alexis Tsipras this morning. They show Varoufakis still has the ear of the PM (who called him a valuable asset last night).... ...and that Greek citizens are still keen to speak with their \u2018rock star\u2019 finance minister. Austrian finance minister hopes the new Greek negotiating team makes progress, fast. Reuters has the details: Hans Joerg Schelling told reporters before a cabinet meeting that he learned of the move only via media reports but that it was \u201cin order\u201d for Tsipras to change the team, adding that \u201cit just has to be quick...I hope we don\u2019t start again at zero.\u201d \u201cWe hope...that the Greek government now gets out of the headlines, that they concretely back up measures with laws, valuations and schedules,\u201d he said. Another encouraging sign. The European Commission says that contact between Greece and its creditors have \u201cintensified\u201d, meaning negotiations are progressing. Despite the lack of progress, Joan Hoey of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons Greece and its creditors can still break the stalemate in time. That\u2019s partly because Eurozone leaders can\u2019t be certain how serious a Grexit would be.... The modus operandi of the euro zone is to seek compromise and to avoid incalculable risks. Especially after the 2008 global financial and economic crisis, risk aversion is so strongly entrenched in every single international organisation that few political leaders are prepared to gamble on Grexit. Against the backdrop of a fragile euro zone economic recovery and the tense geopolitics over Russia/Ukraine, letting go of Greece would mean stepping into \u201cuncharted waters\u201d as Mario Draghi, ECB president, put it. No matter what they might say about the euro zone being \u201cring-fenced\u201d against contagion, and no matter how frustrated they are with Mr Varoufakis et al, euro zone political leaders do not want a Grexit. ....and partly because the Greek people want to remain in the eurozone: Despite deep popular resentment of the austerity policies tied to the bailout programme, the vast majority of Greeks want to stay in the euro zone. This is a constraint on how far the Syriza government can push back in its negotiations with the Eurogroup. As time has gone on and the government\u2019s hardline stance has failed to wring concessions and heightened Grexit risk, popular support for the government\u2019s confrontational approach has ebbed. The conceit nurtured by Syriza during its election campaign that it could reject bailout conditions but keep the country in the euro zone has been exposed\u201d. Back in Athens, a senior government MP has criticised the decision to shake up Greece\u2019s negotiating team and sideline finance minister Varoufakis. Enikos has the details: Speaking on private ANT1 TV, Alexis Mitropoulos, the Greek Parliament\u2019s First Deputy Speaker, said that \u201cYanis Varoufakis was the ideal negotiator and we should have backed him up further.\u201d Mitropoulos further said that will not vote for any austerity measures and that the government should call for a referendum before agreeing on any deal with the creditors. Here\u2019s our own Angela Monaghan\u2019s story on the disappointing UK growth figures: Hello again. While I was off helping with our coverage of the UK growth figures, Yanni Kouts has been monitoring events in Greece: Our Politics Live blog is taking the lead on today\u2019s surprisingly weak UK growth figures: This feels like a big blow to the Conservative Party; economists had expected growth of 0.5%: Breaking: The UK economy grew by just 0.3% in the first three months of 2015. That\u2019s a sharp slowdown on the 0.6% recorded in October-December 2014. Nearly time to discover how the UK economy fared in the first three months of the year..... Europe\u2019s major share indices are all in the red this morning, with investors fretting that the rally may have gone too far. European markets are still close to their highest levels in 14 years, and as Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says: Traders are struggling to find the justification to keep pushing stocks at these elevated levels. Athens is bucking the trend, though -- the main AGT index is up 0.64% in early trading. Here\u2019s Sean Farrell on BP\u2019s financial results: Greek bonds are continuing to strengthen (but remain deep in the danger zone) Hat-tip to Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence for producing a detailed \u2018decision tree\u2019 that outlines the various paths which Greece could follow in the months ahead. (there\u2019s a clearer version online here) Greek bond yields are dropping this morning after prime minister Alexis Tsipras declared that an initial agreement with creditors could be reached by the end of next week. The yield (interest rate) on Greece\u2019s two-year debt has dipped from 22.8% to below 22.4%, meaning its price has risen slightly. Nearly one in two investors expect Greece to leave the eurozone in the next 12 months, according to a regular survey by German research group Sentix. Sentix\u2019s Euro Break-up Index jumped to 49.0% this month, from a previous 36.8%, showing a higher risk of Grexit. That\u2019s the highest since the summer of 2012, before ECB chief Mario Draghi promised to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to protect the single currency. It says: European politicians\u2019 promises to pursue the scenario of Greece keeping the euro are not taken at face value by about the half of all investors. In 2012 Mario Draghi calmed down investors with his ultimate commitment to the euro. But is his pledge still valid for Greece today? One note of caution: the interviews took place between Wednesday April 23 and Friday 25 April, so before Alexis Tsipras appointed new negotiators. Stan Shamu of IG confirms that investors are more upbeat about Greece, thanks to the shake-up of its negotiating team and Alexis Tsipras\u2019s comments overnight: Europe has led the way this week and this is still on the back of optimism around Greece. There are some interesting developments in Greece at the moment with the country reshuffling its bailout negotiating team and forcing Finance Minister Varoufakis to the sidelines. Mr Varoufakis was seen by some as being part of the problem and as a result news of him being sidelined has been well received. The bailout negotiating team met in Athens yesterday and is looking at some of the reform measures the Eurozone has been wanting to see. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is also said to be getting ready to suspend the minimum wage plan with an overall comprehensive package expected to be concluded by early May. Clearly Greece is now starting to play ball and it\u2019ll be interesting to see how the population reacts to the developments. Despite all this, I will reinforce my feeling that the numbers simply do not add up for Greece and we are likely to be back to square one in the not so distant future. The writing is on the wall for Greece and while a last minute deal is likely to be reached, many will be questioning how much longer the Eurozone will be willing to carry a wounded partner through the recovery. There\u2019s a sense of optimism this morning after Greece\u2019s prime minister declared an initial deal with the country\u2019s creditors could be reached by the end of next week. In a late-night interview with Star TV, Alexis Tsipras said that: \u201cOur goal... is to reach a first agreement this week if possible, or next week at the latest....I believe we are close.\u201d But...Tsipras did also caution that issues including pension cuts, mass layoffs and VAT increases are all still \u2018on the table\u2019, suggesting Greece hasn\u2019t yet compromised. And while Tsipras said an early election was off the table, he could be forced to call a referendum: \u201cIf I end up having an agreement that puts me outside the limits (of my mandate), I will have no other resort....The people will decide obviously without elections, I want to make that clear.\u201d In a wide-ranging interview, Tsipras admits that uncertainty this year did mean Greece faces the \u201cdanger of recession\u201d Tsipras also blamed the previous government for creating Greece\u2019s current predicament, and said Europe must share the blame if a deal isn\u2019t reached on time. He also defended his embattled finance minister, saying Yanis Varoufakis remained a key \u2018asset\u2019 for Greece, despite his ructions with fellow finance chiefs. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Coming up today..... Greece\u2019s new bailout negotiating team are getting down to work after yesterday\u2019s shake-up left finance minister Yanis Varoufakis on the sidelines. There are already signs of progress. Last night, the Greek negotiators agreed to draw up a multi-bill including several reforms to put to parliament. As we reported last night, Varoufakis paid the price for the lack of progress this year: Reacting to the news, a senior European Union official confided that it had become \u201cimpossible\u201d to do business with Varoufakis. \u201cIt had got to the point where eyes roll,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople had got sick and tired of being lectured about austerity and the effects of the crisis. Any sympathy for Greece was eroded by his failure to draft concrete proposals.\u201d The shake-up has boosted hopes that a breakthough could finally be in sight. Last night, Greece\u2019s PM claimed that a deal with creditors is \u201cvery close\u201d, but also suggested a referendum could be called if the two sides can\u2019t reach agreement (more on that shortly). We get fresh UK growth figures at 9.30am this morning, showing how the economy performed in the first three months of this year. Economists expect a slight slowdown to +0.5%, from 0.6% in the last quarter of 2014. It\u2019s the last major piece of economic news before May\u2019s general election, so expect lots of political reaction..... European stock markets are expected to fall, after yesterday\u2019s rally drove the FTSE 100 to a new record high. And traders will be digesting results from oil giant BP, which just reported that adjusted profits have slumped by a fifth, to $2.6bn. That\u2019s better than expected. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events though the day....",

This goes beyond the cuts to non-protected departments that either party has planned. </p>",

The thinktank says this would require the Liberal Democrats delivering only an extra \u00a31bn consolidation in 2017-18 than they have planned, and the Tories reining back their ambitions by about \u00a310bn of consolidation. But by 2019-20, the Liberal Democrats would have to shift ground most, with the Conservatives agreeing to \u00a35bn less consolidation than their plans and the Liberal Democrats tightening by an extra \u00a315bn more. The two sides would then have to reach an agreement on the compositon of the consolidation \u2013 the mix between spending cuts and tax rises. Conservative plans include \u00a312bn of welfare cuts, something Nick Clegg has said his party would not accept (the Lib Dem plan calls for \u00a33bn). Likewise, the Lib Dem reliance on \u00a313bn of new tax revenues (including \u00a37bn via clamping down on avoidance) is at odds with Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s argument that his plan requires no new tax rises (beyond \u00a35bn of estimated anti-avoidance savings). If neither side gives ground on welfare cuts or tax increases, an additional, probably impossible \u00a315 bn of cuts in departmental budgets by 2017-18 would be required, the Resolution Foundation says. This goes beyond the cuts to non-protected departments that either party has planned.",

      "bodyText": "Be afraid. Be very afraid. That was the message from the Institute for Fiscal Studies as it dissected the tax and benefit proposals of what are for now the three main Westminster parties. The IFS said the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats were as one in trying to hoodwink voters. Despite what is being said on the campaign trail, there is no magic money tree for the politicians to shake. Promises now will be followed by hard choices later. But that\u2019s modern politics. Being upfront with the voters about the cuts in social security that will be needed to finance tax cuts is not seen as an election-winning strategy. Far better to have a big crackdown on tax avoidance that will raise \u00a34.6bn (Conservatives), \u00a36.7bn (Labour) or \u00a39.7bn (Lib Dems). The IFS was suitably dismissive about these claims, which it said had been plucked from thin air to make the parties sums add up. It said: \u201cAll these parties seem to have a desire to raise tax revenue in vaguely defined, opaque and apparently painless ways. In may cases the proposals would lead to unnecessary increases in complexity and inefficiency in the tax system.\u201d The thinktank was even-handed in the way it took both the Conservatives\u2019 and Labour\u2019s plans apart. The two big tax proposals for the Conservatives are to raise by 2020 the personal tax allowance to \u00a312,500 and to lift the 40% income tax threshold to \u00a350,000: both more than the expected rate of inflation over the next five years. Britain\u2019s low-wage economy means that almost half of adults (44%) earn too little to pay income tax. The big beneficiaries of the policy will be comfortably off two-earner couples. Similarly, raising the 40% threshold helps those on higher incomes. The IFS calculates that someone earning \u00a350,000 a year will gain around \u00a38 a week from the change. But David Cameron has been far less specific about how he intends to make significant savings from Britain\u2019s social security budget. So far, the Conservatives have specified just over \u00a31bn of the \u00a312bn of cuts they intend to make in the first two years of the next parliament, through a freezing of working-age benefits, a reduction in the benefit cap from \u00a326,000 to \u00a323,000, and the removal of housing benefit from 18-21-year-olds claiming jobseekeer\u2019s allowance. The IFS shows that these changes, unsurprisingly, hurt the poor most. Given the lack of detail from the Conservatives, the IFS also has a stab at identifying how Cameron could make his welfare savings. The ringfencing of pensioner benefits means that \u00a390bn of the \u00a3225bn social security budget is off-limits, and that the Conservatives would have to save one pound in every ten currently spent on unprotected services. If they did so, it would take spending in these areas back to levels last seen in 1990. The money could be saved, according to the IFS, by cuts in means-tested benefits for children (\u00a35bn), the abolition of child benefit (\u00a35bn), cutting housing benefit by 10% (\u00a32.5bn) and the taxation of disability benefits (\u00a32.5bn). These cuts would leave already poor families even poorer. Labour\u2019s tough rhetoric, according to the IFS, is not matched by its proposals. Capping increases in child benefit to 1% for 2015-16 and 2016-17 would raise nothing at all, since the 2015-16 increase has already been paid, and the inflation rate for the 2016-17 increase is expected to be 0.2%. Taking the winter fuel allowance away from the richest pensioners will raise \u00a3100m. Ed Miliband\u2019s plan to pay for a new 10p starting rate of tax would be worth 50 pence a week while jacking the top rate of tax up from 45% to 50% will net only \u00a3100m unless Labour can make good on its promises to tackle tax avoidance. Property taxes? Again it is a case of a plague on both your houses. The IFS says it is hard to see a good economic or social rationale for the Conservative plan to increase the inheritance tax threshold. Labour\u2019s promise of a stamp duty holiday for first-time buyers will lead to higher house prices. With some exasperation, the IFS wonders why Labour and the Liberal Democrats are calling for the introduction of a mansion tax when a much better solution would be the long overdue reform of council tax. The reason is self-evident. There are no votes in it.",

    "webTitle": "UK economic growth halves ahead of general election", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economic recovery slowed far more sharply than expected in the first quarter, dealing a major blow to the government\u2019s track record on the economy with a little more than a week to go until the general election. The prime minister David Cameron said the recovery could not be taken for granted after the latest official figures showed that the economy grew by just 0.3% between January and March, half the rate of the previous quarter. Economists were expecting growth of 0.5%. It was the slowest rate of growth since the end of 2012, when there were fears Britain would tip back into recession. Speaking in Enfield, north London, David Cameron played down the dramatic slowdown in growth and used the figures to warn that a Labour government would put the economic recovery at risk. He said: \u201cOur economy is growing; growing at a rate that many other European countries frankly would give their eye teeth for. \u201cThese are one quarter\u2019s figures. But they remind us, a timely reminder, that you cannot take recovery for granted. You take your eye off the ball on reducing the deficit, that would be bad for growth; you take your eye off the ball in being pro-business, that would damage growth.\u201d However, the surprisingly weak growth figure comes at an awkward time for the Conservatives, who have made the economy a major battleground in the run-up to the election. They argue that sustainable growth is dependent on a Tory victory on 7 May, while a Labour victory would plunge the UK into economic \u201cchaos\u201d. Ed Balls, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, seized on the weak data from the Office for National Statistics, saying it showed working families were still suffering at the hands of the Conservatives. \u201cWhile the Tories have spent months patting themselves on the back, these figures show they have not fixed the economy for working families. \u201cTory economic policy may be helping a few at the top but for most people bills have gone up faster than wages. \u201cWorking families can\u2019t afford another five years of the Tories. Labour\u2019s better plan will put working people first, make our economy stronger and ensure the recovery reaches everyone in every part of the country.\u201d The annual rate of growth also slowed sharply, to 2.4% in the first quarter from 3% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, described the latest growth figures as \u201ca jolt\u201d for the coalition parties. \u201cGiven that the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are hoping that many undecided voters will ultimately decide to vote for them due to their management of the economy, this marked slowdown in growth is particularly unwelcome news coming just over a week before the general election,\u201d he said. The last major economic news to be published before the election showed Britain\u2019s recovery was still heavily reliant on the consumer, with the service industry the only key sector of the economy to grow. Services output \u2013 including bars, restaurants and hotels \u2013 grew by 0.5% over the first quarter, a slowdown compared with the 0.9% growth achieved by the sector in the fourth quarter of 2014. Meanwhile construction output fell by 1.6%, industrial production was down 0.1%, and agricultural output shrank 0.2%. A breakdown of industrial production showed manufacturing output grew by just 0.1%, as the government\u2019s much-hoped-for export and factory-led recovery remains elusive. Production overall was dragged down by the mining sector and water and waste management. The ONS said gross domestic product in the first quarter was 4% above its pre-crisis peak. However, more than six years since the beginning of the UK\u2019s recession, the services sector is the only major part of the economy where output has now exceeded its pre-crisis peak. In 2012, the chancellor, George Osborne, set an ambitious target to double UK exports to \u00a31tn by 2020, a target that now looks out of reach, according to the British Chambers of Commerce. The Trades Union Congress general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said Britain needed a new plan for growth, based on investment in infrastructure and good jobs with decent pay. \u201cThe slowest recovery in modern history just slowed down again,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is bad news for jobs and living standards. What\u2019s more, Conservative plans for extreme cuts after the election risk completely killing off this faltering recovery and plunging the economy back into even deeper trouble. \u201cThe makers are marching backwards, construction is slumping and it\u2019s only services that have rescued the economy from shrinking. This is the opposite of the rebalanced economy we were promised.\u201d Stephen Ibbotson, director of business at the ICAEW (Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales), said the slowdown in growth reflected uncertainty ahead of the election, which was dampening company spending plans. \u201cThis is a sharp drop in GDP growth that few economists saw coming. Our research suggests that businesses have hit pause amid growing political uncertainty over what the next government may look like, and ongoing malaise in the eurozone.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "BP\u2019s first-quarter profits beat City forecasts battered by the falling oil price as the company recorded a one-off gain from the government\u2019s changes to the taxation of North Sea oil operations. The oil company said profit excluding non-operating items and accounting effects for the first three months of 2015 fell 20% to $2.6bn (\u00a31.7bn). It was the first quarter to reflect the full impact of the halving of the price of oil in the previous year. But the figure was double the $1.3bn expected by City analysts. Profit at BP\u2019s exploration and production business collapsed to $604m from $4.4bn a year earlier. The group\u2019s refining business performed better than expected, more than doubling profit to $2.2bn from $1bn. Analysts said the main cause of the forecast-beating result was BP\u2019s decision to account for the tax changes designed to support the North Sea industry in the March budget. With the oil industry warning that North Sea operations were in danger, George Osborne reduced the supplementary charge tax backdated to January of this year, from 30% to 20% on newer fields \u2013 reversing an increase in 2011. BP did not give a figure for the one-off gain but it reported a $449m tax credit for the first quarter compared with a tax bill of $1.6bn tax bill a year ago. Kim Fustier, an analyst at Edison Investment Research, said: \u201cBP\u2019s first-quarter results came in slightly better than expected. However, this was largely thanks to one-off positive UK tax effects rather than stronger underlying performance.\u201d BP defended its decision to account for the full expected benefit over the next few years in one go. It said it recorded the expected long-term cost in 2011 when the supplementary charge rose. Oil companies and businesses that support the industry have been hit by the halving of the Brent crude oil price to $54 a barrel from a year earlier \u2013 a low not seen since the depths of the global recession five years earlier. X-Subsea UK, a subsea dredging and excavation business, entered administration yesterday with the loss of 20 jobs. BP sought to reassure investors that its dividend, relied on by savers and pension funds, was safe with oil prices expected to stay low. BP announced a quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share, unchanged from the previous quarter. The chief executive, Bob Dudley, said: \u201cThe dividend is the first priority within our financial framework and the board is committed to maintaining it, as we have today. We can sustain this by successfully resetting our capital and cost base and rebalancing our sources and uses of cash in the prevailing oil price environment.\u201d BP was forced to cut its dividend after the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. It said the total charge at the end of the quarter for the environmental disaster was $43.8bn. It cancelled two rigs in the Gulf of Mexico at a cost of $375m in the first quarter. The first-quarter results could provide some relief for Dudley, who is trying to restore the company to full health after it was weakened financially and operationally by the Gulf of Mexico incident. The government has made it clear that it would oppose a foreign bid for BP, but some analysts are tipping the company as a takeover target after Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s agreed deal to buy BG Group for \u00a342bn. BP has cut capital spending and is selling $10bn of assets to cope with an expected prolonged low oil price. It announced its latest sell-off last week \u2013 a major North Sea pipeline system for \u00a3320m.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Alliance Trust, one of the UK\u2019s oldest investment firms, has reached an 11th-hour compromise with its rebel investor Elliott Advisors, which had been pushing for change at the company. In a reversal of its previous position, the 127-year old institution said it was appointing to the board two of the three independent directors nominated by the US hedge fund, its largest shareholder. In brings to an end a brief but bitter battle between the parties, which will now avoid a showdown at Alliance\u2019s annual general meeting on Wednesday. In return for Alliance\u2019s appointment of the former investment bankers Anthony Brooke and Rory Macnamara to the board, Elliott agreed to drop its nomination of a third director of its choice \u2013 Peter Chambers \u2013 and said it would support the board on all other resolutions at the AGM. Having previously told shareholders \u2013 including at least 50,000 retail investors \u2013 that Elliott\u2019s intervention \u201cthreatens the very existence of the company\u201d, there was a notable change in Alliance\u2019s tone in Tuesday\u2019s statement. Karin Forseke, the chairman, said: \u201cOn behalf of the whole board, I would like to express my gratitude to our shareholders for engaging with us on this important issue. \u201cHaving considered this feedback we have worked with Elliott to find a compromise which we believe is in the best interests of all our shareholders. I would also like to welcome Anthony and Rory to the board where their significant experience will be a considerable asset.\u201d Elliott has a 12% stake in Alliance Trust and had argued that a new approach was required by the company, which it said had persistently performed worse than other investment trusts. The hedge fund also criticised the pay of Alliance\u2019s chief executive, Katherine Garrett-Cox, one of the most high-profile women in the City. She earned \u00a31.34m last year. In a statement on Tuesday, Elliott indicated that it would keep up the pressure despite reaching agreement over the two independent directors. It said: \u201cWe are pleased to have reached an understanding with Alliance Trust and look forward to following the enlarged board\u2019s progress on strategic and business matters over the next year and beyond. \u201cElliott acknowledges and appreciates the widespread engagement and support from fellow shareholders of the company and others in recent weeks. We believe that this solution is in the best interests of all shareholders.\u201d However, as part of the agreement announced on Tuesday the hedge fund agreed that it would not call a general meeting \u201cor seek to agitate against the company, its board or management publicly until after the company\u2019s 2016 AGM at the earliest\u201d. Shares in Alliance rose 1.2% to 525p in early trading.",

      "body": "<p>Alliance Trust, one of the UK\u2019s oldest investment firms, has reached an 11th-hour compromise with its rebel investor Elliott Advisors, which had been pushing for change at the company.</p> <p>In a reversal of its previous position, the 127-year old institution said it was appointing to the board two of the three independent directors nominated by the US hedge fund, its largest shareholder.</p> <p>In brings to an end a brief but bitter battle between the parties, which will now avoid a showdown at Alliance\u2019s annual general meeting on Wednesday.</p> <p>In return for Alliance\u2019s appointment of the former investment bankers Anthony Brooke and Rory Macnamara to the board, Elliott agreed to drop its nomination of a third director of its choice \u2013 Peter Chambers \u2013 and said it would support the board on all other resolutions at the AGM.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/20/alliance-trust-says-hedge-fund-bid-threatens-its-existence-elliott-advisors\">Having previously told shareholders \u2013 including at least 50,000 retail investors \u2013 that Elliott\u2019s intervention \u201cthreatens the very existence of the company\u201d</a>, there was a notable change in Alliance\u2019s tone in Tuesday\u2019s statement. Karin Forseke, the chairman, said: \u201cOn behalf of the whole board, I would like to express my gratitude to our shareholders for engaging with us on this important issue.</p> <p>\u201cHaving considered this feedback we have worked with Elliott to find a compromise which we believe is in the best interests of all our shareholders. I would also like to welcome Anthony and Rory to the board where their significant experience will be a considerable asset.\u201d</p> <p> Elliott has a 12% stake in Alliance Trust and had argued that a new approach was required by the company, which it said had persistently performed worse than other investment trusts. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/31/us-fund-elliott-advisors-steps-up-attack-alliance-trust-katherine-garrett-cox\">The hedge fund also criticised the pay of Alliance\u2019s chief executive, Katherine Garrett-Cox</a>, one of the most high-profile women in the City. She earned \u00a31.34m last year.</p> <p>In a statement on Tuesday, Elliott indicated that it would keep up the pressure despite reaching agreement over the two independent directors. It said: \u201cWe are pleased to have reached an understanding with Alliance Trust and look forward to following the enlarged board\u2019s progress on strategic and business matters over the next year and beyond.</p> <p> \u201cElliott acknowledges and appreciates the widespread engagement and support from fellow shareholders of the company and others in recent weeks. We believe that this solution is in the best interests of all shareholders.\u201d</p> <p>However, as part of the agreement announced on Tuesday the hedge fund agreed that it would not call a general meeting \u201cor seek to agitate against the company, its board or management publicly until after the company\u2019s 2016 AGM at the earliest\u201d.</p> <p>Shares in Alliance rose 1.2% to 525p in early trading.</p>",
