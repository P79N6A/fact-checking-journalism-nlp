      "bodyText": "This week, Guardian journalist Ben Jacobs was assaulted by Republican congressional candidate (now congressman) Greg Gianforte after Jacobs asked him about the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s report on the Republican party\u2019s healthcare plan. Such an event would not happen in Australia \u2013 not because we don\u2019t have politicians who wouldn\u2019t hit journalists (although one hopes that is the case) but because we don\u2019t have an organisation that analyses policy as does the CBO. One of the biggest issues for the Australian Labor party in responding to the May budget is that there is more talk about cuts to growth in spending than about actual cuts. The $22.3bn cut to education, which Labor has spent much of the time since the budget prosecuting, is a cut compared with what it was promising to spend. Such arguments are more difficult to make because, as Joni Mitchell would put it, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got till it\u2019s gone, and if you never had it in the first place it is even less likely you would know you lost it. In 2014, Joe Hockey gave Labor a massive help by including within the budget papers a graph and a line boasting that the changes to funding of education and health \u201cwill achieve cumulative savings of over $80bn by 2024\u201125\u201d. Scott Morrison was not so silly. This year\u2019s budget papers instead argue that \u201cthe government will provide an additional $18.6bn in funding over a decade for schools\u201d. The government, in its briefing to journalists on the \u201cGonski 2.0\u201d funding, did admit in the documents that \u201ccompared to Labor arrangements\u201d its spending would \u201crepresent a saving of $6.3bn over four years ... and $22.3bn over 10 years\u201d. But \u201ccompared to\u201d is different from actual cuts. The problem for Labor is that the issue is no longer just about money. Hockey was cutting funding and replacing it with nothing other than a likely return to the Howard government model. By actually adopting the Gonski framework, the government has shifted the talk from cuts to who gets funding. And the argument waged by Labor is not particularly suited to question time. Any questions around $22bn worth of cuts, or even comparatively less funding to certain schools, have merely given Turnbull a chance to talk about the increases in funding from this year onwards. There is nothing wrong with arguing for more money for schools \u2013 $22bn is not an insignificant amount \u2013 but Labor is now essentially arguing the negative, arguing about cuts rather than celebrating they no longer have to ever worry about hit-lists for cutting funding to private schools. They should ditch their old policy and run with the government\u2019s model but with extra funding. But that will also require Labor to do some heavy policy lifting explaining the need for their level of funding and how they will pay for it. Labor is hindered by the difficulty of explaining the impact of education policy. Turnbull loves being asked about funding cuts because he can (as he did this week) wheel out the government\u2019s \u201cschool funding estimate\u201d calculator and argue that instead of cuts, a school will receive more money. But that calculator only includes commonwealth spending, and of course only refers to increases compared with the current situation, not those proposed by the Gillard government. It makes for a pretty complex argument for voters to grasp. They are in effect being asked to compare apples and oranges as they are being juggled by both parties. Such problems apply to any non-welfare policy area where the purpose of government spending is not just the money. Education and health policy, for example, are notoriously difficult to navigate \u2013 but even estimates on the impact of tax cuts on the economy are mostly left unclear in the budget. The budget papers tell us how much they will cost the budget but very little on the impact to the economy \u2013 except for a line or two about increasing growth in the long-term. It doesn\u2019t need to be this way. In the US, the Congressional Budget Office is an independent government body that analyses all legislation. In March its \u201cscore\u201d of the Republican\u2019s healthcare plan found the plan would lead to increased insurance premiums for the elderly and would see 24 million fewer people insured. So strong was the backlash that the legislation was dumped and the revised version was rushed though the House of Representatives before the CBO could issue its latest analysis. When it did so this week, it found again that premiums would rise for the elderly and that this time 23 million fewer Americans would have healthcare insurance than under the current Obamacare system. And it was when Gianforte was questioned on this analysis that he confronted Jacobs. But in Australia we don\u2019t have the same processes in place. Our Parliamentary Budget Office does not analyse every piece of legislation and does not provide analysis of second-round impacts of policy \u2013 it just adds up the cost or savings to the budget. This year a review of the PBO recommended it not be authorised to examine \u201csecond-round\u201d effects. The main reason given was the belief that if the analysis was shown to be wrong it would make the PBO seem partisan. But that means we are left with mostly partisan analysis. The real reason, I suspect, is that to enable the PBO to provide such analysis it would need a large boost in spending \u2013 making it in effect a mini-department. But the cost of not having such analysis is that policy can get framed purely in terms of impacts on the budget deficit, whereas the real impact of policy is on people. And it also means fights over policy end up becoming debates over what numbers to use to judge that policy, as much as debates about the policy itself. For now, Labor is struggling to adjust to the new numbers. And without any independent score from the PBO, it would be better for it to accept the government\u2019s new figures and model \u2013 and then explain to the public not why the government\u2019s policy is worse than theirs but why Labor\u2019s policy is better.",

      "bodyText": "What a difference a few months make. As 2017 opened, eurozone politicians still raw from the shock of the Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential triumph were nervously awaiting elections in the Netherlands and France. They feared that discontent would propel the populist wave into the heart of Europe and usher in far-right, anti-euro leaders. In the event, the predicted surge for Dutch populist Geert Wilders failed to materialise and in France, Front National candidate Marine Le Pen was decisively beaten by pro-EU centrist Emmanuel Macron. Now, the economic picture for the currency union is looking brighter. Unemployment in the bloc is at its lowest for almost eight years and economic growth was 0.5% in the first quarter, well ahead of the UK\u2019s 0.2%. Business surveys suggest the new year momentum within the eurozone carried on in the second quarter. Based on one report, the flash eurozone PMI (purchasing managers\u2019 index) survey from IHS Markit, growth was at a six-year high in May. The EU recently nudged up its forecast for eurozone growth this year to 1.7%, almost matching the 1.8% of 2016. It also expects unemployment to keep falling as the economic recovery finally spreads to all corners of the region. Experts say it is no coincidence that the approval ratings of populists are fading as the economy strengthens. \u201cSupport levels for anti-establishment or populist parties have declined quite sharply over the past few months,\u201d says Andy Cates at Nomura. He sees a number of causes of the recent strength, including a revival in global growth; improved domestic demand; signs that capital spending is making a comeback; and sharp declines in youth unemployment. In the longer term there will be further support from member nations\u2019 public finances being in better shape, giving governments more space to shore up the recovery, he adds. Economists point out that the relationship between brighter economic news and diminishing popularity for anti-establishment parties works both ways. The decline of populism has in turn helped the economy. \u201cIt looks like confidence in the European economy is returning rather quickly,\u201d says Bert Colijn of ING bank in Amsterdam. He says the brighter mood is down to the economic strength seen in official figures and surveys, and a change in the political atmosphere since the Dutch and French elections. \u201cThere is a sense that we\u2019ve turned a corner in terms of political risk. After Trump and Brexit there was a worry we would see more of this sentiment and this could be the big thing that topples the euro,\u201d said Colijn. But he cautions against getting carried away with what he describes as \u201ceurophoria\u201d. He see risks from Greece\u2019s debt problems and from Italy, where unemployment remains high, particularly among young people. \u201cIt would be silly to think all problems are out of the way.\u201d Reinhard Cluse at UBS is also wary, pointing out that business surveys have tended to come in stronger than official growth figures: \u201cWe are cruising at a high altitude. But this optimism is not fully reflected in the hard data.\u201d Cluse expects the pace of growth in the eurozone to ease off in the second half of this year as higher inflation erodes household spending power and the European Central Bank starts to hint at taking away some of the stimulus of its massive electronic money printing programme. But that was no reason to be downbeat: \u201cAlthough we cannot perhaps maintain the growth rates of the first half, a slowdown from that does not mean bad news. In relative terms, Europe looks good.\u201d Amid such optimism, here is a health check of five key eurozone economies, from Germany\u2019s powerhouse to perennially troubled Greece. Spain GDP growth in 2016: 3.2% GDP growth forecast for 2017: 2.8% Unemployment: 18.2% Youth unemployment: 40.5% After a long downturn and a property crash, Spain has enjoyed one of the eurozone\u2019s fastest rates of GDP growth and a robust rise in employment \u2013 even if a chunk of them are temporary jobs. Youth unemployment is still high by European standards but is down from more than 46% a year ago. Exports have been driving Spain\u2019s recovery, so strength in the rest of the eurozone and the world has helped. A rebound in consumer spending has provided a further fillip but rising inflation could dent that. The housing market has also recovered. But one important source of support for property prices appears to be declining: no other nationality buys as much property in Spain as the British, and sales have slumped since the Brexit vote hit the value of the pound. Italy GDP growth in 2016: 0.9% GDP growth forecast for 2017: 0.9% Unemployment: 11.7% Youth unemployment: 34.1% The recovery in the eurozone appears to have largely passed Italy by, judging by the latest data. GDP rose just 0.2% in the opening quarter of 2017. The sluggish recovery from a recession that only ended in 2014 has taken its toll on living standards. While unemployment in the wider eurozone fell over the past year, in Italy it crept up. But youth unemployment is down. Many economists feel Italy is the weak link in the eurozone and highlight risks that an election expected in early 2018 could usher in anti-establishment politicians like Beppe Grillo\u2019s Five Star movement. Adding to worries about Italy\u2019s potential to destabilise the eurozone, its debt levels remain high; it suffers from a marked north-south divide and its banking system is weighed down by bad debts. Greece GDP growth in 2016: 0.0% GDP growth forecast for 2017: 2.1% Unemployment: 23.5% Youth unemployment: 48.0% Greece has slipped back into recession, with two consecutive quarters of contraction underscoring its fragile state after years of deep spending cuts and political upheaval. Nonetheless, forecasters remain optimistic that it can start growing again in 2017. Greece has the highest unemployment and youth unemployment in the eurozone, and households have been hurt by austerity policies pushed through to appease international creditors. More recently, sentiment has been hit by uncertainty about Athens\u2019s ability to afford loan repayments that fall due in July after eurozone finance ministers meeting this month failed to agree a deal to unlock a tranche of bailout funds for Greece. Hopes now rest on talks in mid-June. But economists feel the risks for the eurozone from Greece have receded since the peak of the crisis in 2012 and since 2015 when the anti-austerity party Syriza swept to power. \u201cWe are not where we were in 2015 and even then it didn\u2019t feel like it [the Greek crisis] was going to take down the eurozone the way people feared in 2012 and 2013,\u201d says Colijn at ING. France GDP growth in 2016: 1.2% GDP growth forecast for 2017: 1.4% Unemployment: 10.1% Youth unemployment: 23.7% Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory this month assuaged short-term fears about a rise of the far-right Front National and anti-euro sentiment generally. But commentators have been quick to warn that the country\u2019s problems have not gone away. Reflecting the frustrations that turned many voters to political extremes, France has a relatively high youth unemployment rate, its overall jobless rate is more than double Germany\u2019s and economic growth is expected to remain sluggish this year. Germany GDP growth in 2016: 1.9% GDP growth forecast for 2017: 1.6% Unemployment: 3.9% Youth unemployment: 6.7% A victory for Macron in France brought big relief to its major trading partner, Germany, where business sentiment has soared. A closely watched business survey by Germany\u2019s Ifo institute last week showed confidence at its highest since records began in 1991. The figures paint a bright picture for Europe\u2019s largest economy and so far it appears to have suffered little fallout from Brexit or the election of protectionist Trump in another of its big trading partners. GDP growth accelerated in the opening months of 2017 on the back of robust exports, stronger state and consumer spending and a buoyant construction sector. That strength bodes well for chancellor Angela Merkel as she seeks a fourth term in September. Germany\u2019s election is not seen to present the same risks to the EU project as other polls. Merkel\u2019s main opponent is pro-European Social Democrat candidate Martin Schulz. *Sources: GDP forecasts from European Commission outlook; unemployment figures from Eurostat (pdf)",

The EU recently <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-performance-and-forecasts/economic-forecasts/spring-2017-economic-forecast_en\">nudged up its forecast for eurozone growth this year to 1.7%</a>, almost matching the 1.8% of 2016. It also expects unemployment to keep falling as the economic recovery finally spreads to all corners of the region.</p> <p>Experts say it is no coincidence that the approval ratings of populists are fading as the economy strengthens. \u201cSupport levels for anti-establishment or populist parties have declined quite sharply over the past few months,\u201d says Andy Cates at Nomura.</p> <p>He sees a number of causes of the recent strength, including a revival in global growth; improved domestic demand; signs that capital spending is making a comeback; and sharp declines in youth unemployment. In the longer term there will be further support from member nations\u2019 public finances being in better shape, giving governments more space to shore up the recovery, he adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/05/eurozone-pmiandgdp/giv-3902VduWxe6Z6tnp/\" data-alt=\"Eurozone PMI\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/05/eurozone-pmiandgdp/giv-3902VduWxe6Z6tnp/\">Eurozone PMI</a> </figure>  <p>Economists point out that the relationship between brighter economic news and diminishing popularity for anti-establishment parties works both ways. The decline of populism has in turn helped the economy. \u201cIt looks like confidence in the European economy is returning rather quickly,\u201d says Bert Colijn of ING bank in Amsterdam. He says the brighter mood is down to the economic strength seen in official figures and surveys, and a change in the political atmosphere since the Dutch and French elections.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a sense that we\u2019ve turned a corner in terms of political risk. After Trump and Brexit there was a worry we would see more of this sentiment and this could be the big thing that topples the euro,\u201d said Colijn. But he cautions against getting carried away with what he describes as \u201ceurophoria\u201d. He see risks from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/23/no-bailout-funds-for-greece-as-eurozone-finance-chiefs-fail-to-agree-deal\">Greece\u2019s debt problems</a> and from Italy, where unemployment remains high, particularly among young people. \u201cIt would be silly to think all problems are out of the way.\u201d</p> <p>Reinhard Cluse at UBS is also wary, pointing out that business surveys have tended to come in stronger than official growth figures: \u201cWe are cruising at a high altitude. But this optimism is not fully reflected in the hard data.\u201d</p> <p>Cluse expects the pace of growth in the eurozone to ease off in the second half of this year as higher inflation erodes household spending power and the European Central Bank starts to hint at taking away some of the stimulus of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/08/ecb-surprises-markets-by-scaling-back-qe\">massive electronic money printing programme</a>. But that was no reason to be downbeat: \u201cAlthough we cannot perhaps maintain the growth rates of the first half, a slowdown from that does not mean bad news. In relative terms, Europe looks good.\u201d</p> <p>Amid such optimism, here is a health check of five key eurozone economies, from Germany\u2019s powerhouse to perennially troubled Greece.</p> <h2>Spain<br></h2> <p><strong>GDP growth in 2016: 3.2%</strong><br><strong>GDP growth forecast for 2017: 2.8%</strong><br><strong>Unemployment: 18.2%</strong><br><strong>Youth unemployment: 40.5%</strong><br>After a long downturn and a property crash, Spain has enjoyed one of the eurozone\u2019s fastest rates of GDP growth and a robust rise in employment \u2013 even if a chunk of them are temporary jobs. Youth unemployment is still high by European standards but is down from more than 46% a year ago.</p> <p>Exports have been driving Spain\u2019s recovery, so strength in the rest of the eurozone and the world has helped. A rebound in consumer spending has provided a further fillip but rising inflation could dent that.</p> <p>The housing market has also recovered. But one important source of support for property prices appears to be declining: no other nationality buys as much property in Spain as the British, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/dec/02/brexit-vote-british-demand-spanish-property-housing-market-spain\">sales have slumped since the Brexit vote hit the value of the pound</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ab11e664ec751f9100339fa2f4c743645b38eb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ab11e664ec751f9100339fa2f4c743645b38eb5/0_207_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni at the G7 in Sicily last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni at the G7 in Sicily last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ettore Ferrari/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Italy</strong></h2> <p><strong>GDP growth in 2016: 0.9%</strong><br><strong>GDP growth forecast for 2017: 0.9%</strong><br><strong>Unemployment: 11.7%</strong><br><strong>Youth unemployment: 34.1%</strong><br>The recovery in the eurozone appears to have largely passed Italy by, judging by the latest data. GDP rose just 0.2% in the opening quarter of 2017. The sluggish recovery from a recession that only ended in 2014 has taken its toll on living standards. While unemployment in the wider eurozone fell over the past year, in Italy it crept up. But youth unemployment is down.</p> <p>Many economists feel Italy is the weak link in the eurozone and highlight risks that an election expected in early 2018 could usher in anti-establishment politicians like Beppe Grillo\u2019s Five Star movement. Adding to worries about Italy\u2019s potential to destabilise the eurozone, its debt levels remain high; it suffers from a marked north-south divide and its banking system is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/06/italian-banks-referendum-fitch-banca-monte-dei-paschi-di-siena-unicredit\">weighed down by bad debts</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Greece</strong></h2> <p><strong>GDP growth in 2016: 0.0%</strong><br><strong>GDP growth forecast for 2017: 2.1%</strong><br><strong>Unemployment: 23.5%</strong><br><strong>Youth unemployment: 48.0%</strong><br>Greece has slipped back into recession, with two consecutive quarters of contraction underscoring its fragile state after years of deep spending cuts and political upheaval. Nonetheless, forecasters remain optimistic that it can start growing again in 2017.</p> <p>Greece has the highest unemployment and youth unemployment in the eurozone, and households have been hurt by austerity policies pushed through to appease international creditors. More recently, sentiment has been hit by uncertainty about Athens\u2019s ability to afford loan repayments that fall due in July after eurozone finance ministers meeting this month failed to agree a deal to unlock a tranche of bailout funds for Greece. Hopes now rest on talks in mid-June.</p> <p>But economists feel the risks for the eurozone from Greece have receded since the peak of the crisis in 2012 and since 2015 when the anti-austerity party Syriza swept to power<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/jan/25/greek-election-syriza-confident-of-victory-live-updates#block-54c56c86e4b089fc37335f2d\">.</a> \u201cWe are not where we were in 2015 and even then it didn\u2019t feel like it [the Greek crisis] was going to take down the eurozone the way people feared in 2012 and 2013,\u201d says Colijn at ING.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4eed558b7c5828b8e666c3fc6c2473b768d78a17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4eed558b7c5828b8e666c3fc6c2473b768d78a17/0_26_3705_2223/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron shake hands after the new French president took office.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron shake hands after the new French president took office.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>France</strong></h2> <p><strong>GDP growth in 2016: 1.2%</strong><br><strong>GDP growth forecast for 2017: 1.4%</strong><br><strong>Unemployment: 10.1%</strong><br><strong>Youth unemployment: 23.7%</strong><br>Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory this month assuaged short-term fears about a rise of the far-right Front National and anti-euro sentiment generally. But commentators have been quick to warn that the country\u2019s problems have not gone away. Reflecting the frustrations that turned many voters to political extremes, France has a relatively high youth unemployment rate, its overall jobless rate is more than double Germany\u2019s and economic growth is expected to remain sluggish this year.</p> <h2><strong>Germany</strong></h2> <p><strong>GDP growth in 2016: 1.9%</strong><br><strong>GDP growth forecast for 2017: 1.6%</strong><br><strong>Unemployment: 3.9%</strong><br><strong>Youth unemployment: 6.7%</strong><br>A victory for Macron in France brought big relief to its major trading partner, Germany, where business sentiment has soared. A closely watched business survey by Germany\u2019s Ifo institute last week showed confidence at its highest since records began in 1991.</p> <p>The figures paint a bright picture for Europe\u2019s largest economy and so far it appears to have suffered little fallout from Brexit or the election of protectionist Trump in another of its big trading partners. GDP growth accelerated in the opening months of 2017 on the back of robust exports, stronger state and consumer spending and a buoyant construction sector. That strength bodes well for chancellor Angela Merkel as she seeks a fourth term in September. Germany\u2019s election is not seen to present the same risks to the EU project as other polls. Merkel\u2019s main opponent is pro-European Social Democrat candidate Martin Schulz.</p> <p><em>*Sources: GDP forecasts from </em><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-performance-and-forecasts/economic-forecasts/spring-2017-economic-forecast_en\"><em>European Commission outlook</em></a><em>; unemployment figures from </em><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/8002525/3-02052017-AP-EN.pdf/94b69232-83a9-4011-8c85-1d4311215619\"><em>Eurostat (pdf)</em></a></p>",

      "bodyText": "It seems crazy to argue that the election will be determined by the economy when events have focused the electorate\u2019s attention on national security and the judgment of the main political leaders. Last year\u2019s Brexit vote illustrated many things, among them the propensity of voters to disregard short-term effects on their personal finances in favour of high ideals for a better world, whatever they felt that to be. Yet the economy looms large in the background of this election and could still play a major role in determining the outcome. And fortunately for Theresa May, the trends of the last few months play into her party\u2019s hands. For Labour, jitters over Britain\u2019s economic outlook only makes the mountain harder to climb. In the postwar era, Labour has tended to gain power in times of hope and confidence, especially the votes in 1966 and 1997. It might be pointed out that Harold Wilson\u2019s two victories in 1974 were narrow and came against a backdrop of steeply rising inflation, strikes and bank collapses, which ostensibly disproves the trend. That would be true if it weren\u2019t for the broader factors that meant the 1970s were Britain\u2019s happiest decade, characterised by low levels of inequality and technological advancements that only seemed to enhance living standards. Fast forward to 2017 and voters appear to be in a more downbeat mood. The latest surveys of household attitudes show that their finances are in a state not seen since the summer of 2014. Three years ago, oil prices were still high and the jobs boom of 2015 and 2016 had yet to arrive. The then chancellor, George Osborne, had already relaxed his tough post-crash austerity measures, but a slowdown in the pace of cuts had yet to take effect. Workers were gloomy. Figures covering the month of May show a return to this state of mind. On balance, more people believe that sluggish wage rises and soaring inflation mean their own personal finances will be worse in a year than those who think they will be better. There will be other factors playing on people\u2019s minds. The prospect of higher interest rates (which won\u2019t happen, despite the Bank of England governor Mark Carney threatening them) will suggest a further squeeze on incomes, as will five more years of austerity under a Tory government. Then there are the long-term threats to many people\u2019s jobs, such as the much-discussed rise of the robots. Looking back over the last seven years, it is easy to see that the feelgood days that came after the summer of 2014 were generated by a sugar rush of low oil prices, low-cost imports and plentiful cheap labour. The gloomy outlook from the high street contrasts with the view from corporate Britain and the City. Business leaders are full of trepidation about the outcome of Brexit talks and the potential impact on friendly relations with trading partners, it\u2019s true. But the main surveys of business opinion show they are optimistic about their prospects in the meantime, by which they mean the next 18 months. The recent downgrade of UK GDP growth would appear to say the opposite. The Office for National Statistics said growth in the first quarter was only 0.2% and not the 0.3% previously estimated after a fall in net trade. A deeper look into the figures shows that much of the deterioration in the UK\u2019s net trade position was down to higher import costs, mostly in response to the declining value of sterling \u2013 not a fall in exports. Also, business investment rose on an annual basis for the first time in over a year, and the second quarter began with a bit more momentum than previously believed. But the conclusion remains that consumers are less confident about the future even if their bosses are chipper. The anxiety that gripped voters after the 2008 crash is reasserting itself. In this atmosphere it will be even more difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to convince floating voters that now is the time to increase the size of the state and do it with a calculated gamble on future tax receipts. Consumers need to feel in expansive mood and believe that things can only get better to vote Labour. Or at least they need to be convinced that a competent Labour leadership, armed with a coherent set of policies, can make their lives better. The Institute for Fiscal Studies was not kind to Labour following its assessment of the main political party manifestos. It said many of its numbers failed to add up. There was also criticism of the Tory plan, but Labour came in for the most criticism. Across the Atlantic in another time, WH Auden summed up a growing mood of popular disquiet in 1948 when he wrote: \u201cWe would rather be ruined than changed We would rather die in our dread Than climb the cross of the moment And let our illusions die.\u201d His poem, The Age of Anxiety, won the Pulitzer prize and was a telling insight into the anxieties of the postwar world. Back in Britain, Labour went on to lose the 1951 election partly because it failed to overcome a sense of gloom about the nation\u2019s prospects. Today we face another age of anxiety and it\u2019s difficult to see how Labour overcomes this hurdle.",
