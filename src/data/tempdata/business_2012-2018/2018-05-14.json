      "bodyText": "Chris Grayling is expected to make a decision \u201cwithin days\u201d to end the existing East Coast rail franchise operated by Stagecoach and Virgin Trains. The transport secretary was said to be preparing to either renationalise the London to Edinburgh line or negotiate a \u201cnot-for-profit\u201d arrangement with Stagecoach and Virgin Trains before the end of the week. Grayling announced in November the franchise would be replaced in 2020, three years earlier than expected, allowing the companies to escape large payments. Two months later, he raised the prospect with MPs of the Department for Transport (DfT) running the line. However, he also held out the possibility that the operators could continue on fresh terms. But, according to the FT, he is now planning to scrap the franchise, the third time in less than a decade that the government has been forced to intervene. He is thought to be more likely to choose the temporary \u201cnot-for-profit\u201d option in the short term, given his aversion to Labour\u2019s re-nationalisation policy. The East Coast mainline franchise is a joint venture of Stagecoach, which owns 90%, and Virgin, which holds 10%. It was signed in 2015 but passenger numbers \u2014 and therefore revenues \u2014 have undershot expectations. Ministers have denied that the companies are being bailed out, saying they will lose a \u00a3165m performance bond and face other penalties. Beyond 2020, the government is expected to introduce a new public-private partnership model on the line. Virgin Trains East Coast said it had \u201cmet or exceeded\u201d all of its contractual commitments on the East Coast line. The DfT declined to comment. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, said: \u201cThis is the third time in 10 years that a private company has mucked up the east coast main line. In contrast, when it was run in the public sector, it returned \u00a31bn to the Treasury. \u201cThat shows what we have been saying all along - that Britain\u2019s railways should be run, successfully, as a public service, not for private profit.

Paddy Power Betfair, another with a small legal US sportsbook operation, rose in value by 12%. That instant reaction is understandable, since the creation, in a single supreme court ruling, of the world\u2019s biggest regulated betting market is impossible to ignore. But before UK investors spend their winnings, they should take a step back. Nobody knows how individual states will tax sports betting or what cut will be demanded by the powerful US sporting bodies that lobbied for legalisation. There is no guarantee that the profit margins will be the same as in the UK. A greater worry is that the UK firms will be playing away from home. It is surely odds-on that US operators will be at the head of the queue when new US licences are handed out. That\u2019s just how life works. Sadly for a company that was early to spot the shifting mood in the US, it may make sense for William Hill to sell itself to a big US entertainment company in search of instant expertise. Italian markets should be watchful Financial markets\u2019 big yawn over the arrival of a populist, free-spending and Eurosceptic government in Italy is only easy to explain at face value. First, betting against the price of Italian debt is a risky trade when the European Central Bank (ECB) remains on hand with its bond-buying programme. Second, the two alliance partners, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the rightwing anti-immigration League, have dropped their previous anti-euro talk, so are not stepping wholly outside the EU consensus. Third, investors may be reflecting that an unlikely coalition government with a slim working majority may not survive for long. Yet the scale of the radicalism being contemplated in Rome is genuinely new. Even in watered-down form, the economic plan represents a huge challenge to EU orthodoxy. Proposals include a flat tax at 15% for companies and most households; a universal income; and repeal of the 2011 reform that raised the pension age. That collection would increase government spending by \u20ac60bn-\u20ac100bn (\u00a353-88bn) a year, say economists, depending on the precise version of the proposals adopted. The higher figure is equivalent to 5.5% of GDP in a country where the stock of debt is 132% of GDP. Even the lower figure, if the accompanying tax-raising measures are relatively modest, would very likely mean Italy bumps up against the EU\u2019s fiscal rules. The coalition partners say they plan to respect those rules but simultaneously say they want them to be relaxed. Something has to give. In the circumstances, the lack of excitement in the Italian bond market, whatever the superficial reasoning, is bizarre. The yield on 10-year paper has risen in the past week but 1.9% (versus 0.6% on German bunds) is miles away from signalling serious concern among investors. A lot of money is resting on the questionable assumption that the new government will not do what it says or will collapse. Either outcome is possible, obviously. But it seems equally likely that the plot could move quickly to confrontation in the form of a demand that the EU change its fiscal rules. That would be a serious showdown, with an uncertain outcome. In the meantime, demands by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for more EU integration look like a non-runner \u2013 which won\u2019t ease tensions.",

    "webTitle": "It's no surprise emissions keep going up. There's no price on carbon | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Late last Friday, the government quietly released the latest data on greenhouse gas emissions and, as has been the case since the ending of the carbon price, they show emissions are increasing. But the figures also highlight that the government\u2019s current plan to focus almost exclusively on electricity, through its national energy guarantee , means Australia will be unable to meet its commitment to reduce economy-wide emissions by 28% below 2005 levels by 2030. The government is never all that excited about releasing the quarterly update on greenhouse gas emissions. In December it released them the week before Christmas, and this time it released it late Friday afternoon \u2013 the end of budget week. The minster for environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, didn\u2019t bother to even put out a media release which, given the importance of the figures to his portfolio, would be like the treasurer not bothering to note the release of the quarterly GDP figures. The budget last week was not exactly replete with money and news about action on climate change. There was $500m to go towards mitigating the impact of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef, which is often the government\u2019s favoured way with climate change \u2013 do bugger all to prevent the harm, and then spend money to make it seem like they care after the damage has been done. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday But as for actual efforts to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, for now the only thing close to a policy is related to electricity via the national energy guarantee. The latest emissions data, however, shows that will in no way be enough. In 2017, Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have been 533.7 Mt CO2 -e. The report notes that this is 2.4% below emissions in 2000 and 11.7% below emissions in 2005. But that rosiness is really a bit of a figleaf as it refers to total emissions including the emissions from the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sectors, which were very high in the early 2000s but which have been reduced due to less forest reduction and planting more trees. Such activity was included in our Paris emissions targets because doing so made the cuts easier to achieve. But the measurement of the LULUCF sector is subject to a fair degree of error, and if you really want to look at actual greenhouse gas emissions you exclude it \u2013 but doing so makes the job of reducing our emissions to 26% below 2005 levels by 2030 much harder: Even including LULUCF, there was a 1.5% increase in emissions in 2017 compared with 2016. The report notes that a big reason for this was \u201cthe expansion in LNG exports, which saw a 41.4% increase in LNG production in 2017 and a forecast increase in LNG production for 2018 of a further 18.1%.\u201d And certainly the report puts to bed any claims that we have some sort of a gas-supply crisis \u2013 production is at record levels \u2013 but most of the increase is going towards LNG exports rather than domestic gas: But let\u2019s not be coy about the cause of these emissions. There is one reason Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have increased, and it is the same one that has been in place since July 2014 \u2013 we no longer have a carbon price: In the three and half years since the carbon price was removed, total greenhouse gas emissions (excluding LULUCF) have grown on average by 1.3% each year \u2013 compared with an average annual fall of 1.1% during the carbon price period. The somewhat good news is that since the end of the carbon price, emissions in the electricity sector, which accounts for just over a third of total emissions, have actually fallen: The reason, however, is not due to any great work by the government in crafting an energy policy designed to encourage renewables or cleaner energy, but because the extremely dirty and inefficient Hazelwood power station has closed. This has seen the use of brown coal to generate electricity in the national energy market fall from accounting for 25% in 2009 to now just 18%: But while emissions from electricity have fallen, they have not fallen anywhere near enough to counter the rises in emissions in other sectors: And with a focus on electricity set to remain, that means our ability to meet our emissions targets looks set to be impossible. Consider that since June 2016, the increase in emissions from transport and stationary energy (emissions that come via manufacturing, mining and other commercial activities) have almost cancelled out the fall in electricity emissions in that period: A one-sector-only approach to emissions reduction is not going to cut it (literally). The government\u2019s own projections last year for our path to 26% or 28% below 2005 levels highlight just how far we have to go, and how unlikely it is to be achieved with the current policy: No one ever really believed Direct Action would work, and it clearly has not. The data shows unequivocally that the government\u2019s climate change policy has been a complete failure. And so long as this government remains beholden to climate change deniers within the partyroom and cabinet, who break out into spasms of lunacy at the mere suggestion of an emissions trading scheme or price on carbon, it will continue to be a failure and our emissions will continue to rise.

But the figures also highlight that the government\u2019s current plan to focus almost exclusively on electricity, through its national energy guarantee , means Australia will be unable to meet its commitment to reduce economy-wide emissions by 28% below 2005 levels by 2030.</p> <p>The government is never all that excited about releasing the <a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/climate-science-data/greenhouse-gas-measurement/publications/quarterly-update-australias-national-greenhouse-gas-inventory-dec-2017\">quarterly update on greenhouse gas emissions.</a> In December it released them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jan/09/australias-emissions-are-rising-its-time-for-this-government-to-quick-pretending\">the week before Christmas</a>, and this time it released it late Friday afternoon \u2013 the end of budget week. </p> <p>The minster for environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, didn\u2019t bother to even put out a <a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/minister/frydenberg/media-releases/index.html\">media release</a> which, given the importance of the figures to his portfolio, would be like the treasurer not bothering to note the release of the quarterly GDP figures. </p> <p>The budget last week was not exactly replete with money and news about action on climate change.

      "bodyText": "British Gas has shed more than 100,000 customer accounts since the start of the year, its parent Centrica has revealed, as the UK\u2019s largest energy provider was warned that looming price rises will increase the number of households switching to rival firms. The rate of people leaving British Gas slowed, from 823,000 quitting between July and October last year, to the loss of 111,000 customer accounts in the first four months of 2018. However, the figures do not reflect the impact of a recent above-inflation price rise by the business, which takes effect at the end of this month. Jefferies bank said account losses would likely pick up then. Colder than normal weather had mixed results as the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d led to higher demand for energy but drove up call-out costs for boiler repairs. British Gas had its busiest ever week for boiler repairs during the cold weather in February and March, leading to service plan costs that will drive down first-half profits at its services unit compared with last year. Although Centrica has largely withdrawn from oil and gas production, as well as large-scale power generation, its Morecambe Bay gasfield suffered outages. Its 20% stake in the UK nuclear\u2019s power fleet will also suffer this year because cracks in one reactor resulted in it being taken offline temporarily. Nevertheless, Centrica said it was on track to hit its targets for 2018, including holding dividends at 12p a share. The company said it was making \u201cgood progress\u201d on its \u00a31.25bn-a-year cost-cutting programme. About 1,000 of 4,000 planned job cuts will have taken effect by the year\u2019s end. The number of connected home customers \u2013 those using its Hive smart home devices \u2013 has reached 1 million. Its decentralised energy business has also had growth. Iain Conn, the Centrica chief executive, said the impact on British Gas of the government\u2019s price cap on standard variable tariffs (SVTs) remains uncertain but the company expects the measure to be in place by the end of the year. British Gas has 3.7 million customers on SVTs, down from 4.3 million at the end of 2017. It expects to cut that further, to about 3 million by the time such tariffs are capped, reducing its exposure to the measure. British Gas has just under 12.8m household accounts. Analysts said there had been good progress on shifting people off the tariffs and on to better-value fixed deals. Asked if customer losses would likely go up significantly when the company\u2019s standard tariff increases at the end of May, Ahmed Farman, an energy analyst at Jefferies bank, said: \u201cYes, assuming that SVTs become more expensive relative to offers from independent suppliers.\u201d Centrica\u2019s share price closed up more than 1% at 149.15p but is still about a fifth lower than before Theresa May confirmed the price cap last October. Conn admitted that 2017 had been \u201cextremely challenging\u201d for Centrica. However, the company defended its management after investors complained about the share price at its annual general meeting on Monday, arguing the firm had made progress on cost-cutting and improving its balance sheet. Scott Wheway, non-executive director, told shareholders at the AGM: \u201cYour frustration is tangible\u2026 we do understand it.\u201d The executive board has foregone bonuses for 2017 because of the share price crash, with Conn missing out on \u00a3610,000.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Italy\u2019s stock mark shrugged off its earlier losses to end the day 0.26% higher at 24,221, a gain of 61 points. Traders have hunkered down for a longer wait before learning who will succeed Paulo Gentolini as Italy\u2019s PM. That\u2019s a fairly calm reaction to the prospect of an anti-establishment party teaming up with a right-wing rival to form a new government that might rip up Italy\u2019s budget targets, cut taxes, introduce a universal basic income, and possibly take issue with Brussels on a range of issues. Investors seem hopeful that the League and M5S will step back form their more radical policies. Or they think that any deal will collapse, bringing fresh elections. Alternatively, they retain faith in the European Central Bank to steer the eurozone through any looming storms. Other markets ended the day in the red, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 losing 13 points to finish at 7,710. That\u2019s all for today. GW Some reaction to the news that the Italian government negotiations haven\u2019t quite reached the fulltime whistle.... The rumour mill in Italy has been working overtime, as politicians, analysts and the media speculate about the identity of Italy\u2019s new prime minister. The FT has the details: Ahead of the meeting between [M5S\u2019s] Mr Di Maio and Mr Salvini [of the League], Rome was gripped by rumours of possible candidates. Il Corriere della Sera, Italy\u2019s leading daily, said there was a horse race between Giulio Sapelli, an economic historian and a former board member at Eni, Italy\u2019s largest oil and gas group, and Giuseppe Conte, a jurist from Puglia and an expert in public administration. Mr Sapelli\u2019s star seemed to be on the rise after he said that he had been contacted by the parties and had offered his full availability for the job, if Domenico Siniscalco, the former finance minister, returned to his old job. But Five Star officials then said Mr Sapelli would not be selected as prime minister. This triggered new speculation that Mr Di Maio himself might clinch the post, but Mr Salvini denied it as he entered the meeting with the Five Star leader. Newsflash from Rome: Italy\u2019s two populist parties haven\u2019t reached a deal yet. An agreement could still be a few days away, according to M5S\u2019s leader Luigi Di Maio.... Newsflash from Washington: the International Monetary Fund has announced that its board will consider Argentina\u2019s request for help on Friday. Gerry Rice, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s spokesperson, says: \u201cIMF staff are continuing discussions with the Argentine authorities toward a Fund-supported program. Our shared goal is to reach a rapid conclusion of these discussions. An IMF Board meeting on Argentina is scheduled for Friday, May 18. This will be an informal meeting, as part of our usual process of briefing the Board on negotiations for high access IMF programs.\u201d Last week, Argentina announced it is seeking a $30bn precautionary credit line to shore up the peso, which has slumped in recent weeks. It\u2019s quite a move, almost 20 years after the government threw out the IMF amid a massive financial crisis. The US stock market has indeed opened higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 95 points or 0.4% to 24,926. Traders are hopeful that US-China trade tensions are easing, following Donald Trump\u2019s olive branch to China\u2019s telecoms firm ZTE. Reuters has more details about how Movement 5 Star and the League\u2019s policy pledges could blow a hole in Italy\u2019s budgets: Five-Star\u2019s flagship policy of a universal income for the poor would cost an estimated \u20ac17bn ($20bn) per year. The League\u2019s hallmark scheme, a flat tax rate of 15% for companies and individuals, is tipped to cut tax revenues by \u20ac80bn per year. Scrapping an unpopular pension reform would cost \u20ac15bn, and another \u20ac12.5bn would be needed to head off an automatic hike in sales tax due for next year. Tax cuts might give Italy a growth boost, though, while universal basic income could help tackle inequality and encourage people to retrain and get back into the labour market. Back in the UK... and fans of Poldark will be interested to learn that Cornwall could soon have a working metal mine again. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Tin mining is set for a comeback in Cornwall, as a Canadian company that plans to reopen the South Crofty mine in 2021 announced it would float on the London stock market next month to help fund the venture. Vancouver-based Strongbow Exploration acquired the rights to the tin mine in the Cornish town of Pool in July 2016. After operating for more than 400 years, South Crofty was the last tin mine to close in the UK 20 years ago, due to a lack of investment and falling metal prices. But since then demand for tin has increased while global supply is falling, driving a 60% surge in tin prices since January 2016 to $21,000 (\u00a315,457) a tonne. Tin is used as solder in consumer electronics and other electronic devices, electric cars and solar cells. The US stock market is expected to open a little higher today, with the Dow called up 60 points. From Rome, our correspondent Angela Giuffrida has the latest on the Italian government talks: Italy\u2019s anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and its far-right partner, the League, are preparing to present their government programme to President Sergio Mattarella on Monday and name a prime minister. Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, and M5S counterpart Luigi Di Maio, worked over the weekend in Milan on a policy document in which they are expected to take a tougher approach towards illegal immigration and the EU. In line with their campaign pledges, the parties, which between them won more than 50% of the vote in the 4 March elections, have also reportedly reached agreement on introducing a flat tax as low as 15%, a universal basic income and dismantling a change to pensions in 2011 that increased the retirement age. They have also pledged to attempt to renegotiate European treaties. \u201cIf the rules, parameters and constraints imposed by Europe do not change, Italy suffocates. This seems to be a shared commitment,\u201d Salvini said. Italian media reported that Di Maio had told the president\u2019s office on Sunday night they would be ready to submit their plan to Mattarella and name a prime minister on Monday. Earlier in the day, the 31-year-old said the pair were \u201cwriting history\u201d and needed time, but that talks had been positive. If Mattarella endorses the candidate, programme and cabinet lineup then he could nominate a prime minister on Monday, paving the way for a government to be sworn in this week before facing a vote of confidence in both houses of parliament. However, Mattarella warned over the weekend that he would not be a \u201cpushover\u201d... More here: Italy\u2019s stock market has dropped a little further into the red, as traders in Milan brace to learn who their next prime minister might be. The FTSE MIB has shed 150 points, or 0.65%, today to 24,005. Overnight, Asian markets had rallied with Hong Kong up 1.3% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei gaining almost 0.5%. Mihir Kapadia of Sun Global Investments thinks the European markets may be getting a little jittery: Despite the gains made in Asia, European markets started off on a cautious tone as increasing global tensions played a part in the decline. With Italy struggling to form a government and the UK government facing internal struggles to cope with Brexit, banking and technology pulled Stoxx Europe 600 lower over the sentiment.\u201d The growing possibility of a populist government in Italy is just one reason why the markets could be choppy in the months ahead. Brexit, the trade talks between the US and China, and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are all potential triggers for a selloff too. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, warns that some investors aren\u2019t ready for the challenges ahead: The period of exceptionally low volatility that investors enjoyed in 2017 is over. 2018 has seen a number of risks surface that could end the economic cycle, triggering a bear market in global equities, or at a minimum, leading to even higher market volatility. Investors need to respond. Based on our analysis of our own positioning data, many investors are entering this higher volatility environment unprepared.\u201d So, is it time to sell up? Haefele says not... \u201cThe road ahead will be more difficult to navigate than the road that\u2019s behind us. Returns will likely be lower \u2013 we\u2019re assuming annualised equity market returns in the mid-to-high single digits. But we don\u2019t believe a pick-up in volatility signals the end of the bull market. This is not a time to jump to cash. The cost of being uninvested remains high.\u201d The news that Italy\u2019s president will meet the party leaders in the mid-afternoon hasn\u2019t given the markets a jolt. After nearly four hours of trading, the European trading floors remain calm with the main indices slightly lower. As well as Italy, investors are also pondering what to make of Donald Trump\u2019s latest move. The US president surprisingly tweeted yesterday that he was trying to save jobs... in at a Chinese telecoms firm. It\u2019s a remarkable twist, given Trump\u2019s claims that Chinese firms have been unfairly taking jobs away from America. It\u2019s particularly odd, as ZTE is in hot water for violating US sanctions by illegally shipping American technology to Iran and North Korea. This prompted a a ban on US companies selling components to ZTE, after the US commerce department concluded that ZTE was not complying with an agreement over the sanctions-busting. Trump\u2019s decision to spring to ZTE\u2019s aid may signal that relations with China are warming up - perhaps Beijing wants the ZTE issue resolved before reaching a wider deal on trade reform. Jean Pisani-Ferry, senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank, says Italy\u2019s next government needs to take urgent action to improve its economy and boost productivity. Pisani-Ferry points out that Italy\u2019s financial position is precarious, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 132% (ie, Italy owes more than its entire annual economic output). But that\u2019s the product of weak growth, not reckless borrowing, he explains: The root of Italy\u2019s public-finance problem is that it inherited excessively high debt from the 1980s and has not recorded significant economic growth for two decades. Real (inflation-adjusted) GDP in 2017 was at the same level as in 2003, and real GDP per capita was at the level of 1999. With a stagnant denominator, it is hard to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio: the legacy of the past continues to weigh excessively on the present. A thought experiment helps in understanding Italy\u2019s problem. Had France followed the same policy as its southern neighbor since the launch of the euro in 1999 \u2013 that is, had it recorded, year after year, the same primary balances \u2013 its public debt today would be 45% of GDP, instead of 97%. The difference between the two countries is not that France has been wise and Italy profligate. Quite the contrary. The reason why France has a significantly lower debt today is that it inherited a better fiscal position and has been growing faster. The lesson, therefore, is that Italy\u2019s key priority should be to revive growth. But this cannot be accomplished by relaxing the brake on public spending. The bulk of Italy\u2019s growth problem comes from the supply side, not the demand side. As documented in a recent paper produced by the Bank of Italy, the country\u2019s productivity performance is truly dismal: over the last two decades, output per employee has decreased by 0.1% per year, compared to 0.6% growth in Spain, 0.7% in Germany, and 0.8% in France. Furthermore, the demographic outlook is frightening: the working-age population, currently at the same level as in the late 1980s, is set to decline by 0.5-1% annually in the years to come. The burden of repaying the debt will fall on a smaller labor force \u2013 even more so if the retirement age is lowered.... More here. Economist Daniel Lacalle agrees that the European Central Bank is holding down eurozone bond yields - but I don\u2019t think he approves..... Peter Rosenstreich of online bank Swissquote thinks investors are too complacent this morning: Political risk is building in Italy, and markets are ignoring it. Yield spreads failed to react to news that the Northern League and 5-Star parties have reached a tentative coalition. This might have dramatic implications for Italian government spending: but the Euro continues to firm against the US dollar. The European Central Bank can also take some credit for today\u2019s calm markets. Back in 2011, Italy\u2019s borrowing costs hit dangerous levels during the political crisis that forced Silvio Berlusconi out of office. Since then, the ECB has launched a series of schemes to shore up the eurozone, including its huge QE bond-buying programme. That asset purchase scheme has driven eurozone bond yields (the cost of borrowing) down to record low levels. The ECB says the programme is meant to stimulate growth and fight deflation, but it is also acting as a safety net for the eurozone. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says: As long as the ECB has the bond market\u2019s back, the euro will try to ignore Italian politics. Newsflash: Italian president Sergio Mattarella will meet with the leaders of Movement Five Star and the League this afternoon. Mattarella must judge whether a stable government can be formed, avoiding the need for new elections. Over in Milan, the Italian stock market has dipped by 60 points, or 0.25%, to 24,101 points. One theory for the muted reaction is that any alliance between M5S and the League will soon collapse, triggering new elections. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit thinks Italy may soon be heading back to the polls.... Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, suspects those new policies could be unaffordable. She writes: After lengthy post-election negotiations, the populist Five Star Movement is poised to join a coalition government with the extreme right-wing League. So far, their headline policy proposals include lower taxes and earlier retirement. Italy has struggled for decades with government deficits and resultant inflation, and there is a clear danger that the country\u2019s finances may, yet again, be about to spiral out of control. The draft programme being drawn up between the two parties may include some popular policies. According to Bloomberg, it includes \u201ca flat tax as low as 15 percent, a guaranteed income for the poor and a lower retirement age\u201d. This implies a certain degree of fiscal loosening, which might see Italy exceed its current borrowing targets. Bloomberg says: The parties\u2019 economic program costs between 65 billion euros and 100 billion euros, according to an estimate in newspaper Corriere della Sera on Monday, adding that the flat tax is the most expensive measure. The euro has actually risen this morning, up 0.3% against the US dollar at $1.198. That indicates that the markets aren\u2019t spooked about the situation in Italy. An alliance between Italy\u2019s M5S and the League had been seen as the \u2018nightmare scenario\u2019 for investors. Royal Bank of Canada says it has been fielding calls from clients, wondering why there isn\u2019t more market reaction to the prospect of a populist government. RBS\u2019s theory is that the two parties will resist trying to take Italy out of the euro: The erstwhile \u2018euro sceptic parties\u2019 \u2013 particularly the M5S \u2013 have distanced themselves quite substantially from their anti-European rhetoric. The reason why such a scenario was initially feared was that this would somehow lead to an Italian version of Brexit (even though the actual practicalities of how to get such a result implemented were always questioned by the market). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the global economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A few years ago, the prospect of two populist parties taking control in one of the eurozone\u2019s biggest - and most indebted - members would have rocked the markets. But times have moved on, and investors are remarkably relaxed about the latest developments in Italy, where the the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the far-right League are on the brink of power. The two unlikely bedfellows informed Italy\u2019s president yesterday that they have reached an agreement about a government programme, and are ready to choose a new prime minister. As the AFP newswire reported late last night: Matteo Salvini, head of the nationalist League, had earlier said in a statement he and Five Star Movement (M5S) leader Luigi Di Maio were \u201cwriting history\u201d and would call President Sergio Mattarella. Press agency AGI reported Di Maio made a brief call to the president\u2019s office to \u201cannounce that they are ready from tomorrow (Monday) to report on everything, including the name of the prime minister\u201d. If the head of state accepts the nomination, the position could be filled within days. A breakthrough would end more than two-months of deadlock following Italy\u2019s inconclusive general election in March [Reminder: the League became the most powerful right-wing party, overtaking Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia, while M5S won nearly as many votes as the centre-right coalition] But it also creates a bucketload of uncertainty, given the two parties are radically different. The League, whose powerbase is Italy\u2019s wealthy north, favours low taxes and a crackdown on immigration. Movement Five-Star, though, wants greater government investment in new infrastructure, stronger workers rights, and a push on green energy. Both parties do represent a break from Italy\u2019s past, though. And they share one instinct, though - scepticism about the European Union, and a dislike of the austerity measures imposed to keep Italy in line with Brussels. And yet... traders aren\u2019t panicking. European stock markets are expected to be calm this morning, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 hovering at its highest level since late January. The bond markets are also relaxed about the prospect of a new Italian government clashing with the EU over deficit targets. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains. Any new program if implemented could well bring any new Italian government into conflict with EU budget rules. So far market reaction has been muted to the prospect of an agreement, though Italian bond markets did fall sharply last week with the 10 year yield rising 12 basis points over the week, to just shy of 1.9%.",

Real (inflation-adjusted) GDP in 2017 was at the same level as in 2003, and real GDP <em>per capita</em> was at the level of 1999. With a stagnant denominator, it is hard to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio: the legacy of the past continues to weigh excessively on the present.</p> <p>A thought experiment helps in understanding Italy\u2019s problem. Had France followed the same policy as its southern neighbor since the launch of the euro in 1999 \u2013 that is, had it recorded, year after year, the same primary balances \u2013 its public debt today would be 45% of GDP, instead of 97%. The difference between the two countries is not that France has been wise and Italy profligate. Quite the contrary. The reason why France has a significantly lower debt today is that it inherited a better fiscal position and has been growing faster.</p> <p>The lesson, therefore, is that Italy\u2019s key priority should be to revive growth. But this cannot be accomplished by relaxing the brake on public spending. The bulk of Italy\u2019s growth problem comes from the supply side, not the demand side. As documented in a recent <a href=\"https://www.bancaditalia.it/pubblicazioni/qef/2018-0422/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1\">paper</a> produced by the Bank of Italy, the country\u2019s productivity performance is truly dismal: over the last two decades, output per employee has <em>decreased</em> by 0.1% per year, compared to 0.6% growth in Spain, 0.7% in Germany, and 0.8% in France. Furthermore, the demographic outlook is frightening: the working-age population, currently at the same level as in the late 1980s, is set to decline by 0.5-1% annually in the years to come. The burden of repaying the debt will fall on a smaller labor force \u2013 even more so if the retirement age is lowered....</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/italy-productivity-and-growth-imperative-by-jean-pisani-ferry-2018-04\">More here.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Bruegel_org/status/995770667827154944\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;With a 132% debt-to-GDP ratio, Italy\u2019s public finances are precarious.

      "bodyText": "The value of London-listed gambling firms, including 888, Paddy Power Betfair and William Hill, surged by more than \u00a31.5bn after the US supreme court struck down a nationwide ban on sports betting that has stood for 26 years. The court upheld a legal challenge by the state of New Jersey, which argued that the Professional and Amateur Sport Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA) was unconstitutional. The ruling, by seven votes to two, starts a race among British bookmakers and online gambling companies to win customers in the lucrative US market, with individual states now expected to draw up laws to allow sports betting. Shares in online gambling firm 888, which operates a poker network in three US states, surged by more than any other company, gaining 15%. The chief executive, Itai Frieberger, said the firm was \u201cuniquely positioned to exploit the potential growth opportunities in the US market that today\u2019s ruling opens up\u201d. Paddy Power Betfair and William Hill \u2013 both of which have built sizeable footholds in the US in readiness for the repeal of PASPA \u2013 enjoyed gains of 12.2% and 10.7% respectively. GVC, which sealed a \u00a34bn merger with Ladbrokes earlier this year but has less of a presence in the US, rose by a more modest 7.6%, while the gambling software company Playtech was up by 3%. The combined share prices inflated the value of London-listed gambling firms by more than \u00a31.5bn. Traditional high street bookmakers such as William Hill have recovered most or all of the losses seen on the back of reports that the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals will be cut to \u00a32. A decision on FOBTs, which account for more than half of UK bookmakers\u2019 revenues, is expected this week. The William Hill chief executive, Philip Bowcock, said: \u201cThis is a landmark moment for sports betting and for William Hill. Now, all attention shifts to the States, where steps have already been taken to prepare for this day. Legalised sports betting means that consumers and sports leagues will have greater protection, states will benefit from the raising of taxes and there is the potential for over 100,000 jobs to be created. \u201cWe welcome the ruling and expect to be operational in New Jersey as soon as responsibly possible. We are also actively working on opportunities in a number of other states and will update on these opportunities as appropriate.\u201d Geoff Freeman, the president of the American Gaming Association (AGA), said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision is a victory for the millions of Americans who seek to bet on sports in a safe and regulated manner.\u201d The AGA has argued that the law against sports betting has given rise to a huge illegal gambling industry that accepts $150bn (\u00a3110bn) in wagers a year, much of it run by organised crime gangs such as the mafia. In its ruling, the supreme court said: \u201cSupporters argue that legalisation will produce revenue for the states and critically weaken illegal sports betting operations, which are often run by organised crime. \u201cOpponents contend that legalising sports gambling will hook the young on gambling, encourage people of modest means to squander their savings and earnings, and corrupt professional and college sports.\u201d However, it said it was not the supreme court\u2019s decision to make a \u201cpolicy choice\u201d, only to decide whether PASPA was in keeping with the constitution. Gambling industry analysts said the scale of the opportunity for gambling companies would depend on how tightly individual states decide to regulate the industry. Some states are expected to restrict sports betting to land-based casinos or racetracks, rather than permitting online bets, while others have proposed tax rates that industry figures say are unworkable. Analysts at the stockbroker Goodbody said: \u201cIt could take a number of years before we see wide-scale US sports betting and significant investment may be required to develop a meaningful business in the US.\u201d",

We are also actively working on opportunities in a number of other states and will update on these opportunities as appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>Geoff Freeman, the president of the American Gaming Association (AGA), said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision is a victory for the millions of Americans who seek to bet on sports in a safe and regulated manner.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The AGA has argued that the law against sports betting has given rise to a huge illegal gambling industry that accepts $150bn (\u00a3110bn) in wagers a year, much of it run by organised crime gangs such as the mafia.</p> <p>In its ruling, the supreme court said: \u201cSupporters argue that legalisation will produce revenue for the states and critically weaken illegal sports betting operations, which are often run by organised crime. </p> <p>\u201cOpponents contend that legalising sports gambling will hook the young on gambling, encourage people of modest means to squander their savings and earnings, and corrupt professional and college sports.\u201d</p> <p>However, it said it was not the supreme court\u2019s decision to make a \u201cpolicy choice\u201d, only to decide whether PASPA was in keeping with the constitution.</p> <p>Gambling industry analysts said the scale of the opportunity for gambling companies would depend on how tightly individual states decide to regulate the industry.</p> <p>Some states are expected to restrict sports betting to land-based casinos or racetracks, rather than permitting online bets, while others have proposed tax rates that industry figures say are unworkable.</p> <p>Analysts at the stockbroker Goodbody said: \u201cIt could take a number of years before we see wide-scale US sports betting and significant investment may be required to develop a meaningful business in the US.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Construction of luxury flats in central London dropped by a quarter last year, with apartments housed in developments dubbed \u201cposh ghost towers\u201d struggling to sell. New-build starts in the capital in 2017 dropped by 25.4% compared with 2016, according to a report by London Residential Research and the luxury estate agents London Central Portfolio (LCP). The number of new-build starts fell in seven of the 11 inner London boroughs featured in the study, with a 62% decline in Southwark (where there has been significant development around Elephant and Castle) and 42% falls in Wandsworth (which includes the developments along the Thames in Battersea and Nine Elms) and Westminster. In total, new-build starts in the inner boroughs fell by 3,810 units. Naomi Heaton, the chief executive of LCP, said developers were scaling back their ambitions after realising there was \u201ca huge oversupply of over-commoditised new-build boxes\u201d in London. \u201cAn awful lot of what was built was generic and overpriced and they struggled to sell it,\u201d she said. \u201cHistorically, a lot of properties would have been bought by overseas investors in the assumption that they could flip it and sell it on at a huge profit, but now there is huge nervousness following increases in stamp duty and the the impact of Brexit.\u201d In January the Guardian revealed that more than half of the 1,900 ultra-luxury \u00a31m-plus apartments built in London last year failed to sell. One property buying agent in the luxury sector, Henry Pryor, warned at the time that the city would be left with a legacy of \u201cpart-built posh ghost towers\u201d. Builders have delayed work on an additional 13,800 units they had planned to build, according to the research. Developers have slashed prices to shift stock: the average cost of luxury London properties has fallen by 14% from its 2014 peak. The number of \u00a31m-plus sales has fallen by 24%, according to the bank Coutts. It said 53% of prime property on the market was being sold below asking price, compared with 42% last year. Prime-property buyers can now expect to achieve an average of 12.1% off the asking price, which works out at \u00a3300,000 off a 2,000 sq ft property. The number of 20-storey or higher blocks under construction in London has fallen by 32%, from 46 in 2016 to 32 in 2017. The total number of flats in new tower blocks has fallen from 8,200 to 5,500. The estate agent Strutt &amp; Parker has said prime-property prices in central London could fall 5% this year. Guy Robinson, the head of residential at the agency, said: \u201cIn a climate of fast property price growth and low stamp duty, the cost of moving previously seemed relatively inconsequential, but now, with higher stamp duty and lower house price growth, moving costs are extremely material in the whole event, and has had an impact. \u201cPeople have come to terms with Brexit, and sellers should be preparing to act on plans put back from last year. As we move into summer, we are hopeful that a lift in confidence will see an increase in supply to meet current buyer demand.\u201d Camilla Dell, a managing partner at the property buying agent Black Brick, said: \u201cWe are seeing continued interest from Middle Eastern buyers, with Saudi clients particularly active. Brexit notwithstanding, the UK offers political, economic and legal stability. \u201cSaudi buyers tend to value confidentiality and favour trophy properties. In the current market, few of those are marketed publicly. Around a third of the properties we bought for clients last year were sold off-market.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Npower owner Innogy has privately told staff it is extremely concerned they will bear the brunt of thousands of job cuts planned as part of a major shakeup of the European energy industry. German energy giant E.ON has warned up to 5,000 jobs will be axed when it acquires the energy networks and customer-facing parts of Innogy, as part of a huge asset swap with RWE. Innogy management said publicly last week that it feared its 43,000 staff would be at a disadvantage to E.ON employees as roles are shed during the integration of the firms next year. More than 6,000 of those are based in the UK, mostly at npower but also in the company\u2019s renewable energy business. Leaked emails from management to staff reveal how deeply worried the firms\u2019s leadership is that Innogy staff will be the biggest losers from the deal. Uwe Tigges, the Innogy chief executive, wrote: \u201cWe are extremely concerned that the planned transaction and the job cuts announced by E.ON will be unilaterally pursued to the disadvantage of the Innogy employees.\u201d He said that talks with E.ON and RWE had so far failed to secure legally binding assurances that Innogy staff would not be unfairly affected. As a result of the impasse, Tigges told workers in an email: \u201cE.ON accepts that you, our employees, must continue living with significant uncertainty.\u201d The concerns come as npower said on Monday that its merger with the energy supply business of UK-listed SSE was on track. The UK competition watchdog last week launched a full-scale investigation into the merger, saying the move could push up energy prices. Npower\u2019s profits for the first three months of the year were up by more than a quarter, to \u00a337m, despite losing 66,000 domestic customer accounts due to \u201cintense market competition\u201d. The firm was boosted by the price hike it announced last year, higher demand because of below-average temperatures and its continued cost-cutting efforts. Paul Coffey, npower chief executive, said: \u201cAlthough our results show signs of progress, this is mainly due to cost management as the market we operate in remains very competitive, which is putting real pressure on margins and customer account numbers.\u201d He warned that the energy market remained tough, and said the government\u2019s energy price cap later this year meant npower would have to continue to strictly manage its costs. The energy supplier was widely criticised last week after becoming the fifth of the big six energy suppliers to hike its standard tariff for about 1 million customers. The company\u2019s standard tariff was already the most expensive of the large suppliers, even before the increase.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mothercare is close to agreeing a rescue plan that includes raising fresh funds from investors and accelerating store closures. The struggling childrenswear and maternity retailer said it was finalising a comprehensive restructuring and refinancing package to put the business on a stable and sustainable financial footing. \u201cWe are in the final stages of detailing these restructuring plans alongside new committed debt facilities, an underwritten equity issue and access to other sources of capital,\u201d it said. The firm\u2019s new chief executive, David Wood, who was parachuted into the job last month and previously ran US department store group Kmart, will provide further details on Thursday alongside the group\u2019s full-year results. Mothercare issued a profit warning in January following disappointing sales over Christmas. It slashed its profit forecast to \u00a31m to \u00a35m for the year to the end of March. City analysts are expecting profits to crash to \u00a31m from \u00a319.7m last year. Mothercare shares fell by almost 10% to 18.09p in early trading on Monday as the company confirmed it would tap shareholders for cash. Like other household names on the high street, the company has been battling weak consumer spending and a shift to online shopping, as well as increasing competition in the toy and kidswear market. Toys R Us and Maplin are among the chains that have gone into administration, with the loss of thousands of jobs. Shoppers are deserting the high street in greater numbers than during the depths of the recession in 2009, the latest footfall figures from the British Retail Consortium and Springboard suggest. They tallied with a 2% drop in consumer spending last month, according to Visa\u2019s consumer spending index, which has recorded declines in 11 of the past 12 months. Mothercare, which has an \u00a380m hole in its pension pot, has been in discussions with its lenders, Barclays and HSBC, since March, when it revealed it was on course to breach the terms of its bank loans and needed extra cash to fund an overhaul of the business. The company is also expected to announce a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a form of insolvency used to close unprofitable stores and drive down rents, to speed up store closures. Mothercare started shutting stores four years ago and has reduced its UK portfolio from 220 to 137, with a target of 80-100 as sales move online. It is also refurbishing remaining outlets. Britain\u2019s biggest carpet retailer Carpetright is also using a CVA to close 92 stores \u2013 with the potential loss of 300 jobs \u2013 and negotiate rent reductions of up to 50% with landlords.",

Glass Lewis also recommended that investors reject WPP\u2019s pay report, which saw Sorrell paid \u00a314m last year, because of the lack of transparency around his departure. The advisory body also criticised the way Quarta, who is also head of WPP\u2019s nomination committee, has prepared in advance for life after the departure of the company\u2019s founder after 33 years. \u201cWe harbour concerns as to the transparency and efficacy of the succession process,\u201d said Glass Lewis. \u201cDespite previous assurances we believe the nomination committee has failed to adequately prepare for the replacement of Sir Martin.

    "webTitle": "With or without Trump, we must back UN's education drive | Larry Elliott", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "All things considered, the United Nations could have chosen a better week to launch an initiative designed to raise $10bn to invest in global education. That this is not exactly a golden age for multilateralism was underlined last week when Donald Trump decided that the US was going to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal despite strong lobbying from Germany, France and the UK. Trump has his own way of doing things and for the most part that involves unravelling the legacy of his predecessor. Barack Obama signed up for the Paris climate change deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement (TPP) and the accord that lifted sanctions on Iran, and Trump has said all three suck and need to be renegotiated. The current White House only sees a merit in internationalism when it clearly furthers the president\u2019s America First agenda. This is a high-risk strategy. The US is already on the brink of a trade war with China that could easily develop into a currency war. There have already been ramifications in the Middle East from the unpicking of the Iran deal. The US has not completely given up on multilateralism. Trump initially seemed reluctant to give the go-ahead for a $13bn capital increase for the World Bank that would allow the Washington-based organisation to lend more. In the end, the Bank got its money \u2013 but only once it had agreed to reforms that would make borrowing more expensive for China. Even so, the rest of the world can no longer take for granted that the US will play a pivotal role in any attempts to craft multilateral solutions to global problems. For 70 years, American presidents took the view that multilateralism \u2013 even when flawed \u2013 served US interests. That is no longer always the case. And if the Americans are not prepared to participate, there is a risk that the whole system will start to unravel. No other country is really prepared to take up the role of global leadership. Which is why the new UN education initiative \u2013 the International Finance Facility for Education \u2013 is significant. Unveiled in New York last Friday, the idea is being championed by the former prime minister Gordon Brown, now the UN special envoy for global education. Brown proved mightily effective when he was chancellor between 1997 and 2007 as an advocate for international cooperation on development. Even then, in the pre-financial crisis days, getting rich countries to agree to debt relief or to increase their aid budgets was not easy. The climate is a lot more difficult now than it was at Gleneagles in 2005 when the G8 summit agreed to write off poor-country debt and double aid spending. In the much gentler environment of the early 2000s, countries joined together to launch the Global Fund to fight Aids, TB and malaria, and the vaccine alliance Gavi \u2013 both of which saved millions of lives. The new UN facility hopes to have the same sort of impact in education. The scheme involves donor countries devoting more of their aid budgets to education but also providing guarantees that would allow the World Bank and the regional development banks to leverage up their lending for education. The UN believes that $1bn of guarantees will lead to an additional $4bn of investment and that reaching its $10bn target is feasible. Extra spending is certainly needed. There are more than 260 million children and young people not in school. Dropout rates in poor countries are so high that half a billion children either abandon primary school or learn very little. About one in 10 of the world\u2019s population is illiterate and in 20 countries in Africa and Asia more than half the people cannot read or write. This is all happening at a time when the world of work is about to be transformed by robotics and artificial intelligence. Nobody knows for sure what the AI revolution will mean for jobs but even those who are most bullish about its impact accept that those who will adapt best are likely to be the skilled and the well educated. One of the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals is that by 2030 every child should complete primary and secondary education. On current trends, that target is going to be missed by a mile and, in any event, slightly misses the point. It is not only the quantity but also the quality of education that needs to be addressed. Learning standards in a low or lower-middle income country are 100 years behind those in the developed world \u2013 and that divide is going to widen if the current trends persist. The traditional development route was for countries to move their people out of the fields and into the factories, where they would produce low-cost goods for export. However, in the future, the route out of poverty will be education-led growth \u2013 and that is going to be expensive. There is not the slightest prospect that low and lower-middle income countries can fund the necessary investment in education out of their own meagre resources. Meanwhile, the share of international aid being spent on education has fallen over the past decade \u2013 from 13% to 10%. On past form, it would be unwise to assume that Trump will support the UN initiative. But other rich countries certainly should because there will be consequences if the scheme fails. One will be mass migration because people in poor countries want the lifestyle they see in rich countries and if they cannot get it at home they will move to somewhere else. But they will also be spurning an opportunity to show that multilateralism is not dead.",

      "body": "<p>All things considered, the United Nations could have chosen a better week to launch an initiative designed to raise $10bn to invest in global education. That this is not exactly a golden age for multilateralism was underlined last week when Donald Trump decided that the US was going to pull out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/iran-deal-trump-withdraw-us-latest-news-nuclear-agreement\">Iran nuclear deal</a> despite strong lobbying from Germany, France and the UK. Trump has his own way of doing things and for the most part that involves unravelling the legacy of his predecessor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/iran-deal-trump-withdraw-us-latest-news-nuclear-agreement\">Iran deal: Trump breaks with European allies over 'horrible, one-sided' nuclear agreement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Barack Obama signed up for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/donald-trump-says-he-might-sign-back-up-to-a-revamped-paris-accord\">Paris climate change deal</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/13/trump-says-he-would-rejoin-tpp-if-offered-better-terms-than-obama\">Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement </a>(TPP) and the accord that lifted sanctions on Iran, and Trump has said all three suck and need to be renegotiated. The current White House only sees a merit in internationalism when it clearly furthers the president\u2019s America First agenda. This is a high-risk strategy. The US is already on the brink of a trade war with China that could easily develop into a currency war. There have already been ramifications in the Middle East from the unpicking of the Iran deal.</p> <p>The US has not completely given up on multilateralism. Trump initially seemed reluctant to give the go-ahead for a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-g20-wbank/world-bank-shareholders-back-13-billion-capital-increase-idUSKBN1HS0QS\">$13bn capital increase for the World Bank</a> that would allow the Washington-based organisation to lend more. In the end, the Bank got its money \u2013 but only once it had agreed to reforms that would make borrowing more expensive for China.</p> <p>Even so, the rest of the world can no longer take for granted that the US will play a pivotal role in any attempts to craft multilateral solutions to global problems. For 70 years, American presidents took the view that multilateralism \u2013 even when flawed \u2013 served US interests. That is no longer always the case. And if the Americans are not prepared to participate, there is a risk that the whole system will start to unravel. No other country is really prepared to take up the role of global leadership.</p> <p>Which is why the new UN education initiative \u2013 <a href=\"http://educationcommission.org/international-finance-facility-education/\">the International Finance Facility for Education</a> \u2013 is significant. Unveiled in New York last Friday, the idea is being championed by the former prime minister Gordon Brown, now the UN special envoy for global education.</p> <p>Brown proved mightily effective when he was chancellor between 1997 and 2007 as an advocate for international cooperation on development. Even then, in the pre-financial crisis days, getting rich countries to agree to debt relief or to increase their aid budgets was not easy. The climate is a lot more difficult now than it was at Gleneagles in 2005 when the G8 summit agreed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jun/11/uk.g8\">write off poor-country debt and double aid spending.</a></p> <p>In the much gentler environment of the early 2000s, countries joined together to launch the Global Fund to fight Aids, TB and malaria, and the vaccine alliance Gavi \u2013 both of which saved millions of lives. The new UN facility hopes to have the same sort of impact in education.</p> <p>The scheme involves donor countries devoting more of their aid budgets to education but also providing guarantees that would allow the World Bank and the regional development banks to leverage up their lending for education. The UN believes that $1bn of guarantees will lead to an additional $4bn of investment and that reaching its $10bn target is feasible.</p> <p>Extra spending is certainly needed. There are more than 260 million children and young people not in school. Dropout rates in poor countries are so high that half a billion children either abandon primary school or learn very little. About one in 10 of the world\u2019s population is illiterate and in 20 countries in Africa and Asia more than half the people cannot read or write.<br></p> <p>This is all happening at a time when the world of work is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/12/robot-technology-threat-terminist-uk-call-centre-workforce\">about to be transformed by robotics</a> and artificial intelligence. Nobody knows for sure what the AI revolution will mean for jobs but even those who are most bullish about its impact accept that those who will adapt best are likely to be the skilled and the well educated.</p> <p>One of the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals is that by 2030 every child should complete primary and secondary education. On current trends, that target is going to be missed by a mile and, in any event, slightly misses the point. It is not only the quantity but also the quality of education that needs to be addressed. Learning standards in a low or lower-middle income country are 100 years behind those in the developed world \u2013 and that divide is going to widen if the current trends persist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The traditional development route was for countries to move their people out of the fields and into the factories, where they would produce low-cost goods for export. However, in the future, the route out of poverty will be education-led growth \u2013 and that is going to be expensive.</p> <p>There is not the slightest prospect that low and lower-middle income countries can fund the necessary investment in education out of their own meagre resources. Meanwhile, the share of international aid being spent on education has fallen over the past decade \u2013 from 13% to 10%.</p> <p>On past form, it would be unwise to assume that Trump will support the UN initiative. But other rich countries certainly should because there will be consequences if the scheme fails. </p> <p>One will be mass migration because people in poor countries want the lifestyle they see in rich countries and if they cannot get it at home they will move to somewhere else. But they will also be spurning an opportunity to show that multilateralism is not dead.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tin mining is set for a comeback in Cornwall, as a Canadian company that plans to reopen the South Crofty mine in 2021 announced it would float on the London stock market next month to help fund the venture. Vancouver-based Strongbow Exploration acquired the rights to the tin mine in the Cornish town of Pool in July 2016. After operating for more than 400 years, South Crofty was the last tin mine to close in the UK 20 years ago, due to a lack of investment and falling metal prices. But since then demand for tin has increased while global supply is falling, driving a 60% surge in tin prices since January 2016 to $21,000 (\u00a315,457) a tonne. Tin is used as solder in consumer electronics and other electronic devices, electric cars and solar cells. Richard Williams, the Strongbow chief executive, said: \u201cThe company continues to advance South Crofty to a production decision, with a plan to recommence production in 2021. The project has all necessary permits in place and, as a former producing mine, offers great potential at a relatively low risk. \u201cThe global demand for tin, especially in consumer electronics, combined with current tin price forecasts, underpins Strongbow\u2019s strategy.\u201d He estimated that the mine would employ 275 people, in an area where jobs are scarce. While global demand for tin is expected to remain stable, supply is set to decline over the next five years as production from the world\u2019s main producers \u2013 China, Malaysia, Indonesia and Peru \u2013 continues to fall. Strongbow is already listed in Canada and is backed by Canadian precious metals firm Osisko Gold Royalties, its biggest shareholder with a 30.6% stake. The firm will float on London\u2019s junior Aim market in June because it needs to raise \u00a325m over the next 18 months to fund its plans for South Crofty. The company owns a mining licence valid until 2071, has planning permission to build a new process facility and has received a loan from Osisko to construct a water treatment plant. A previous attempt to revive the mine by Baseresult Holdings, which acquired the site in 2001, failed and South Crofty was placed into administration in 2013.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shoppers are deserting the high street in greater numbers than during the depths of the recession in 2009, creating a brutal climate that is putting thousands more retail jobs at risk. The coming days will be crucial to the future of a handful of household names, including Mothercare and Carpetright, which are trying to persuade investors to make vital cash injections so they can jettison unwanted stores. There is also the spectre of job losses at Poundworld, the struggling discount chain, which is being cut adrift by its American owners. Dwindling shopper numbers tally with weak spending figures for April, which show Britons slashed spending on gadgets, furniture and even nights out. Consumer spending dropped 2% last month, according to Visa\u2019s consumer spending index, which has recorded declines in 11 of the past 12 months. \u201cWith inflation beginning to fall and wages growing faster than expected in recent months, it would have been easy to assume we might be over the worst of the consumer squeeze,\u201d Mark Antipof, the chief commercial officer at Visa, said. \u201cYet there has been no corresponding improvement in spending. It is clear that consumers remain in belt-tightening mode.\u201d High street visits declined 3.3% in April, according to the BRC-Springboard monthly tracker, which also highlighted nearly one in 10 town centre shops are lying empty. The drop in footfall came on the back of a disastrous performance in March, when shopper numbers declined by 6%. Taken together there has been an unprecedented 4.8% drop over the two months \u2013 a bigger decline than was recorded in the same months of 2009 when the UK was mired in recession. \u201cNot since the depths of recession in 2009 has footfall over March and April declined to such a degree, and even then the drop was less severe at -3.8%,\u201d said the Springboard analyst Diane Wehrle. \u201cMuch could be made of the adverse impact on April\u2019s footfall of Easter shifting to March but even looking at March and April together still demonstrates that footfall has plummeted.\u201d In recent months the high street has been rocked by a wave of administrations, with Toys R Us and Maplin among the brands to disappear, taking thousands of jobs with them. New Look, Carpetright and House of Fraser are among the big names resorting to company voluntary arrangements (CVA), a form of insolvency used to close unprofitable stores. This trend has contributed to a rise in the national town centre vacancy rate, which increased from 8.9% in January to 9.2% in April, according to the BRC-Springboard data. On Thursday the new Mothercare chief executive, David Wood, who was parachuted into the job last month, is due to update investors on its search for new investment. In March the struggling retailer, which has an \u00a380m hole in its pension pot, revealed it was on course to breach the terms of its bank loans and needed extra cash to finance its reinvention. The company is understood to have approached potential rescue buyers and is also considering a CVA to speed up the closure of underperforming stores. Carpetright has already had its CVA, which will result in 92 stores closing, approved by landlords. The final hurdle for the chief executive, Wilf Walsh, to clear is raising \u00a360m from the City to shore up Carpetright\u2019s finances, a fundraising push that is due to begin this week. However, in a sign that investors are reluctant to pump cash into struggling retailers, Carpetright said last week that it had borrowed \u00a315m from its biggest shareholder, Meditor European Master Fund, to tide it over until the proceeds from the cash call are banked. Despite its large shareholding, Meditor still demanded a \u00a32.25m arrangement fee and is charging interest of 18%. Poundworld\u2019s owners, the American private equity firm TPG, had previously indicated plans to support the retailer through a CVA that would have enabled the closure of nearly a third of its 355 stores. But it emerged over the weekend that TPG has had a change of heart and is trying to offload the loss-making business it acquired in a \u00a3150m deal in 2015. Poundworld, which started in 1974 as a market stall in Wakefield in West Yorkshire, has 5,500 employees. However, given the retailer\u2019s recent poor financial performance, any new backer is likely to want to push through a painful restructuring via a CVA or even an administration. Likely bidders could include turnaround firms such as Alteri Investors or Endless, while fast-growing discounter B&amp;M could also be interested in acquiring some of the chain\u2019s stores.",

This trend has contributed to a rise in the national town centre vacancy rate, which increased from 8.9% in January to 9.2% in April, according to the BRC-Springboard data.</p> <p>On Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/04/mothercare-replaces-ceo-with-former-kmart-boss\">the new Mothercare chief executive, David Wood</a>, who was parachuted into the job last month, is due to update investors on its search for new investment. In March the struggling retailer, which has an \u00a380m hole in its pension pot, revealed it was on course to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/02/mothercare-in-rescue-talks-with-banks-as-uk-retail-crisis-spreads\">breach the terms of its bank loans</a> and needed extra cash to finance its reinvention. The company is understood to have approached potential rescue buyers and is also considering a CVA to speed up the closure of underperforming stores.</p> <p>Carpetright has already had its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/26/carpetright-poundworld-and-fenwicks-set-to-axe-jobs\">CVA, which will result in 92 stores closing, approved by landlords</a>. The final hurdle for the chief executive, Wilf Walsh, to clear is raising \u00a360m from the City to shore up Carpetright\u2019s finances, a fundraising push that is due to begin this week. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, in a sign that investors are reluctant to pump cash into struggling retailers, Carpetright said last week that it had borrowed \u00a315m from its biggest shareholder, Meditor European Master Fund, to tide it over until the proceeds from the cash call are banked. Despite its large shareholding, Meditor still demanded a \u00a32.25m arrangement fee and is charging interest of 18%.</p> <p>Poundworld\u2019s owners, the American private equity firm TPG, had previously indicated plans to support the retailer through a CVA that would have enabled the closure of nearly a third of its 355 stores. But it emerged over the weekend that TPG has had a change of heart and is trying to offload the loss-making business it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/14/high-street-chain-poundworld-sells-majority-stake-to-us-investors\">acquired in a \u00a3150m deal in 2015</a>. </p> <p>Poundworld, which started in 1974 as a market stall in Wakefield in West Yorkshire, has 5,500 employees. However, given the retailer\u2019s recent poor financial performance, any new backer is likely to want to push through a painful restructuring via a CVA or even an administration. Likely bidders could include turnaround firms such as Alteri Investors or Endless, while fast-growing discounter B&amp;M could also be interested in acquiring some of the chain\u2019s stores.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A fledgling UK network of community or \u201chonesty\u201d fridges, which offer free food to those with limited means, is set to double in size in six months, thanks to funding from a major supermarket. The Community Fridge Network, run by environmental charity Hubbub, is to receive \u00a345,000 from Morrisons, it will be announced this week, allowing it to increase the total of 31 fridges to 58 by November. A community fridge is stocked with surplus food \u2013 typically close to its sell-by date \u2013 donated by local retailers, restaurants and households and its contents are free to local residents. Regular users may be reliant on food banks, while recent additions include fridges for university students. Food waste is a huge issue in the UK, with \u00a313bn of edible food thrown away from homes every year (according to the government\u2019s waste advisory body, Wrap) and a further \u00a33bn wasted by the hospitality and food service sector. On average each local fridge redistributes 525kg a month, meaning that more than 30 tonnes of food per month will be saved from waste by November. Morrisons stores have already been regularly donating edible surplus food to community fridges in Sheffield, Frome in Somerset and Shildon in County Durham, and will aim to set up partnerships with five new stores. \u201cEvery area should have a community fridge\u201d said Trewin Restorick, chief executive of Hubbub. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderfully simple way to stop fresh food from going to waste and it\u2019s fantastic to see organisations like Morrisons supporting the network. With more investment and support from big businesses, we can make sure so much more fresh food is enjoyed and not destroyed.\u201d Andrew Woffindin, coordinator of the community fridge at the University of Sheffield said: \u201cThe partnership provides the opportunity for students and people in our local community who have a limited budget to make fresh meals with food that would otherwise have gone to waste.\u201d The scheme was launched in July 2017 with start-up funding from the Esm\u00e9e Fairbairn Foundation, North London Waste Authority, The Funding Network and Sainsbury\u2019s. Fridges and freezers are donated by Bosch. The network received a significant boost in December 2017 thanks to \u00a3160,000 of National Lottery funding. Community fridges were found to be one of the most effective and low-cost tools to use edible food in a year-long, \u00a310m trial by Sainsbury\u2019s in the South Derbyshire town of Swadlincote. Despite the trial\u2019s success, the Guardian revealed last week that the supermarket has dropped the programme after customers said their priorities had changed. Among other retailers donating food to the fridge network are Tesco (via charity FareShare), Waitrose, the Co-op, Marks &amp; Spencer, Nando\u2019s, Lidl and Spar.",
