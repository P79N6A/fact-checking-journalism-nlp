This week the first full container of English wine will be shipped to the US \u2013 5,000 bottles from four different producers, including some of the best-known names in English wine. The wines, from Digby Fine English, Hush Heath Estate, Bolney Wine Estate and Camel Valley, are produced in Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and Cornwall. All are award-winning sparkling wines made in the traditional method, and are destined for nine states including New York, Pennsylvania, Montana and Massachusetts, as well as the capital, Washington DC. For the past five years English wine has been on an unstoppable upward curve. Investment in equipment and expertise, together with a gradual increase in global temperatures, means Britain\u2019s sparkling wines \u2013 90% of which are made with chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier, the three grapes used to make champagne \u2013 rival the world\u2019s best fizz.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Should Theresa May take the axe to the troubled Hinkley Point nuclear project, it will propel wind and solar power further into the limelight. And for renewable technologies to become really effective, Britain and the rest of the world need breakthroughs in electricity storage to allow intermittent power to be on tap 24/7, on a large scale and for the right price. Cheap, light and long-life batteries are the holy grail, and achieving this requires the expertise of people like Cambridge professor Clare Grey. The award winning Royal Society fellow is working on the basic science behind lithium-air batteries, which can store five times the energy in the same space as the current rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that are widely used today. She is also focusing on sodium-ion and redox flow batteries; the latter store power in a liquid form, contained in vats or tanks that in theory can easily be scaled up to power-grid sizes. \u201cThere has been an amazing transformation in this field. There is an explosion of interest and I am extremely lucky to have decided early on to concentrate on this area,\u201d she says, although she is keen to play down the idea that a eureka moment is just around the corner. She is also thankful for Hinkley \u2013 if only because of the government\u2019s long-term funding deal with EDF Energy that it gave rise to. \u201cIt has put a price on [future] electricity in the market which is high, and this has potentially opened up further commercial space for new technologies such as batteries. But independent of Hinkley we do need better batteries and my chemistry will hopefully help find them,\u201d she says. The wisdom of bringing in the Chinese to help EDF, the French state-owned utility company, construct the proposed new Somerset reactors has been highlighted as a key factor behind the government\u2019s reluctance to push the go button. But ministers are also aware that, in the last 18 months, many experts in the field have concluded that the biggest argument against the plant is not that it is too expensive, at \u00a318.5bn, but that the kind of \u201con-all-the-time\u201d power it delivers is no longer what is required. Even employers\u2019 trade body the Institute of Directors said last week that it was right for the government to run the slide-rule over Hinkley again to see whether it really made sense. City investment house RBC Capital Markets says no current minister starting from scratch today would ever agree to the deal George Osborne oversaw with EDF: a 35-year index-linked contract paying \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour in 2012 money \u2013 double the current wholesale price of electricity. But, more ominously for government, it adds: \u201cWe question whether such large-scale generation is needed in a rapidly changing and decentralising electricity market where the costs of renewables and storage are coming down.\u201d That is traditionally a message that has come from the leaders of the wind and solar sector \u2013 such as Jeremy Leggett, the founder of solar panel maker Solarcentury and a figurehead for the wider green industry. He is delighted that others are picking up on arguments he has been making for years. \u201cFinally the message is getting through that Hinkley, and indeed nuclear, make no sense today simply because wind and solar are cheaper. If we accelerate renewables in the UK, we can get to 100% renewable power well before 2050,\u201d he says. \u201cThe message is getting through on the feasibility of this too. One thousand cities around the world are committed to 100% renewable supply, some as soon as 2030. More than 60 giant corporations are committed to 100% [low carbon] supply, some as soon as 2020.\u201d Part of the growing confidence in wind and solar comes from experience. Portugal ran for four days on only wind, solar and hydro power in May, while solar power in Britain produced more electricity than coal-fired stations in the same month. Dong Energy, the biggest investor in British offshore wind farms, says it is already possible to produce power with a subsidy of \u00a385 per megawatt hour, and costs are dropping all the time. The Global Wind Energy Council in Brussels claims that wind power alone reached 432.42 gigawatts of installed capacity at the end of 2015 \u2013 more than the 382.55GW of nuclear for the first time ever. But that wind capacity can be available on average only about 40% of the time, compared to 90% for nuclear. Paul Dorfman, a senior research fellow at the Energy Institute at University College London, says for too long Hinkley has been justified by reference to immediate supply shortages that in fact can\u2019t be met by nuclear. And he says that pouring money into new atomic power plants can only take investment away from renewables, whose costs are dropping, unlike those of atomic power. \u201cHinkley will definitely not come online in time to help with the critical UK electricity gap or with our carbon emission commitments. In fact, due to inevitable delays and cost overruns, Hinkley will block scarce resources going to necessary UK renewables, grid upgrades, and energy efficiency. Don\u2019t believe the hype: it\u2019s not \u2018nuclear and renewables\u2019 \u2013 because of the sheer cost of nuclear, it\u2019s \u2018nuclear or renewables\u2019,\u201d he argues. Cornwall Energy, an energy industry consultancy, recently released a chart showing increasing numbers of periods when there are negative wholesale prices for power, which effectively means electricity on the UK grid is free. Tom Edwards, a consultant at Cornwall, says: \u201cAs the UK adds more low-marginal-cost generators to the network, especially wind and solar, we would expect to see more and longer-duration negative pricing events.\u201d The Economist, traditionally a cheerleader for low-cost market solutions to everything, including energy, has also lost faith in Hinkley, which it describes as a \u201cwhite elephant\u201d. \u201cTo keep the lights on in the short run it would make more sense to use gas-powered plants. These can be built quickly, run cheaply and turned on or off as required. Meanwhile, the sums earmarked for Hinkley could be put to use in better ways,\u201d it said in an editorial headlined \u201cHinkley Pointless\u201d. The Economist believes improved electricity storage is a key answer to the frequently repeated criticism of wind and solar that it is intermittent, and points out that battery technology is fast improving. The magazine also champions interconnectors, which can link energy-hungry Britain with northern Europe, where there is a wind-energy surplus, or with a country such as Iceland \u2013 a centre of geothermal power due to its volcanoes. The Economist concludes: \u201cAll of these options would be cheaper than Hinkley, which would take 10 years to get going and represent a huge, continuing cost to bill payers, if it ever worked at all. Such a strategy would also buy time to see what new technologies emerge.\u201d The atomic lobby is desperate to see Hinkley go ahead as soon as possible. \u201cWe should not be pitting technologies against each other. The scale and scope of the challenge means we need all technologies available to meet our energy needs, as 65% of capacity will close between 2010 and 2030,\u201d says Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association and a former Labour MP. \u201cThis needs to be replaced with low-carbon generation, including both nuclear and renewables. Hinkley Point C will provide 3.2GW of power \u2013 7% of the UK\u2019s electricity needs \u2013 with further nuclear projects taking this to 16GW by the mid-2020s.\u201d However, Steve Thomas, emeritus professor of energy policy at Greenwich University, says the UK should bide its time and not be panicked into making ill-considered decisions such as giving the green light to Hinkley. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to do anything in double-quick time. The coal plant does not need to close before 2025. As long as its utilisation is low, it won\u2019t cause large emissions. \u201cTwo of our eight nuclear plants will probably close in 2023, the rest will go on till 2028 and beyond. If no more delays happen, Hinkley will be online in 2026; the other nukes are a few years behind, whatever the developers say. So nuclear is the slowest, riskiest possible way to meet any gap.\u201d",

The scale and scope of the challenge means we need all technologies available to meet our energy needs, as 65% of capacity will close between 2010 and 2030,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.niauk.org/\" title=\"\">Tom Greatrex</a>, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association and a former Labour MP. \u201cThis needs to be replaced with low-carbon generation, including both nuclear and renewables. Hinkley Point C will provide 3.2GW of power \u2013 7% of the UK\u2019s electricity needs \u2013 with further nuclear projects taking this to 16GW by the mid-2020s.\u201d</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.gre.ac.uk/business/study/ibe/staff/steve-thomas\" title=\"\">Steve Thomas</a>, emeritus professor of energy policy at Greenwich University, says the UK should bide its time and not be panicked into making ill-considered decisions such as giving the green light to Hinkley.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to do anything in double-quick time. The coal plant does not need to close before 2025. As long as its utilisation is low, it won\u2019t cause large emissions.</p> <p>\u201cTwo of our eight nuclear plants will probably close in 2023, the rest will go on till 2028 and beyond. If no more delays happen, Hinkley will be online in 2026; the other nukes are a few years behind, whatever the developers say. So nuclear is the slowest, riskiest possible way to meet any gap.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fans of the great British boozer should be raising a glass to Wandsworth council. The local authority stepped in last week to throw a protective arm around the borough\u2019s licensed premises, a move real-ale lobby group Camra has urged other councils to follow in order to slow the closure of pubs for redevelopment. The number of pubs across the UK has been in decline for years, and while the pace of their disappearance has slowed \u2013 from 27 a week earlier this year to 21, according to Camra \u2013 the direction of travel has not changed. The trend has been attributed to factors including pub prices comparing unfavourably with the cost of alcohol in supermarkets and changing cultural habits, with more people entertaining and sharing a tipple at home. Another increasingly common denominator in pub closures has been large chains finding it more lucrative to sell or redevelop premises for other purposes, such as housing or supermarkets, than to continue running them as pubs. A report by London property agency Fleurets found that half of the pubs sold in 2015 were converted for other use. \u201cI\u2019ve sold more pubs for multimillion sums this year than I ever have,\u201d says James Davies, head of pubs at Fleurets. \u201cThe demand for property in London is exceptionally strong. The market will pay more than perhaps it\u2019s worth because they want the asset so much.\u201d Faced with this trend, Wandsworth council in south London took the unprecedented step of using a special piece of planning law \u2013 an \u201carticle 4 direction\u201d \u2013 to protect its pubs. The provision, usually employed in regard to individual developments, means that owners of 120 bars and pubs in the borough will have to seek council permission before changing the building\u2019s use or knocking it down. Wandsworth said the sites had been chosen for their \u201chistoric or architectural value or because they make a positive contribution to their community\u201d. Councils across the UK, some of which have already used article 4 in individual cases, are understood to be keeping an eye on what happens in Wandsworth. The move was inspired partly by a high-profile campaign to save The Wheatsheaf, a redbrick Victorian watering hole in Tooting Bec that was due to be sold to Tesco. Jon Irwin, a Liberal Democrat activist who started a petition to save the Wheatsheaf, puts Wandsworth\u2019s decision to wield article 4 powers down to councillors\u2019 recognition of the strength of local opinion. \u201cWe set up the petition and it just went nuts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the groundswell of opinion that did it. They were left with no illusions that this is what people wanted. No politician in their right mind was going to let it close.\u201d Methods used elsewhere to protect pubs have had mixed results. Many communities sought to have their local declared an asset of community value (ACV), which triggers a six-month moratorium on the building being sold, giving residents a chance to raise enough cash to table their own bid for it. Some 1,200 pubs around the UK now have ACV status, and some government cash, albeit a modest \u00a31.5m in total, is available to communities in the form of a pub loan fund administered by the Department for Communities and Local Government. But ACV status doesn\u2019t help much when communities can\u2019t raise enough money to put in a competitive offer. And a cash shortfall among community bidders is much more likely in areas with high property prices, where redevelopments are consequently more likely. \u201cIt has become evident that ACV listings are not enough to give pubs the protection they deserve from closure, or acquisition and demolition, or redevelopment by investors,\u201d said Colin Valentine, chairman of Camra. \u201cCommunities are not getting enough of a say in the process when the pubs they treasure are threatened by closure or change of use.\u201d John Harrison, who lives in the south Cambridgeshire village of Guilden Morden, is among the leaders of an ongoing campaign to save the village\u2019s Three Tuns pub and agrees that ACV status has yielded mixed results. \u201cThe concern I have is not the legislative framework but the inconsistency of application by officers at local level,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cIn our case, the officers ignored the pub\u2019s ACV status and its heritage as a listed building in a conservation area. \u201cThe main reason so many are closing is that the value of the building and the land for housing is much more than its value as a pub, especially in the south-east. But if we allow pubs to be lost unnecessarily, we undermine our local communities.\u201d Harrison believes article 4 powers, or even compulsory purchase orders allowing councils to buy property deemed of value to the area, might be needed to expand campaigners\u2019 toolkit. \u201cFrom the conversations we have had with other community groups trying to save their pubs this [problem with ACVs] is not unique. We have had to fight a lot harder than we should have done to avoid losing an important local asset. I think it [use of article 4] may have been helpful to us, because anything that makes it harder to turn pubs into houses is good.\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly, the British Beer and Pubs Association, which represents the very pub companies which are often behind the sale and closure of premises for redevelopment, doesn\u2019t think councils should copy Wandsworth\u2019s blanket approach. \u201cIt is right that there are laws to protect pubs that are of real value, to local people and local communities,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cThis can be done by using the laws that make a pub an asset of community value. \u201cHowever, as each pub\u2019s situation is different, this should be looked at on a case-by-case basis. We are against blanket measures, as every case should be judged on its own merits. In some cases a pub might not be viable. A measure like this then makes it very difficult to sell, and restricts investment, which has a huge financial impact.\u201d Some councils, keen not to obstruct much-needed developments for the sake of pubs that can\u2019t be saved, have opted to apply bespoke measures rather than powers such as article 4. In 2012, Cambridge city council issued a set of guidelines aimed at stemming a wave of pub closures as property owners cashed in on the city\u2019s high property prices. Rather than seeking a blanket measure requiring planning approval, the council drew up its own policies, aimed at ensuring that developments could go ahead only once it had become clear that a pub was not viable. This includes a requirement that the property be on the market for at least 12 months as a public house, and that it has not otherwise been shown to be of particular value to the community. While Cambridge council can still wheel out the big guns of article 4 in special cases, coming up with its own approach allows it to tailor policy to the local situation. Whatever the measures at the disposal of councils, the key component is still concerted and passionate local campaigns led by committed people. After the success of the campaign to save The Wheatsheaf, Irwin wants groups who fear the loss of a much-loved tavern to follow suit, whether through ACVs, article 4 or other means. \u201cWe let developers do what they want at our peril. The door is ajar, the example is there. Why not copy it?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Rhiannon Beauregard, 33, is visiting New York for a few days. But the sex and marriage therapist is not here for a vacation, to see the sights or visit friends in the city where she once went to college. She is here to freeze her eggs. Beauregard lives in Austin, Texas where she runs her own practice, but has opted to come to New York to use the services offered by Extend Fertility. The clinic is the first of its kind \u2013 focusing only on egg freezing and not offering any other fertility services and treatments such as in vitro fertilization. By doing that, the clinic has been able to cut costs of its services to $5,000 while offering personalized service to each one of its clients. One of the barriers to egg freezing becoming mainstream is the cost. The procedure was still deemed to be experimental until just a few years ago and was mostly an accepted way to extend fertility for older women, cancer patients or those diagnosed with fertility disorders. Since it is considered to be an elective procedure, egg freezing is typically not covered by health insurance. The average cost of the procedure is about $10,000 with an additional $2,000 to $5,000 for the necessary medication and another couple of thousand dollars for storage. If the frozen eggs are actually to be used for IVF later on, that would cost an additional $12,000. Altogether, that adds up to more than $25,000 \u2013 not exactly chump change. Aware of the costs, two years ago, Facebook and Apple announced that they would cover up to $20,000 in costs for any female employee that wanted to freeze their eggs. While Extend Fertility is unable to cut the costs of medicine (the clients are required to pay for it on their own) or the future costs of IVF, its founders hope that by cutting the cost of the initial procedure in half they will make the procedure accessible for more women. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive either way. We know that,\u201d says Joshua Klein, co-founder and chief medical officer of Extend Fertility. He points out that $5,000 is still half as expensive as $10,000 and adds that the Extend is \u201cworking with financing partners\u201d so that those interested could opt to pay $200 or $300 a month for a while instead of a one-time payment. \u201cWe are trying to be innovative and thoughtful about that,\u201d he says. Should women view egg freezing as some kind of down payment on their future? Klein would prefer that they think of it an investment for both the future and the present. Many women worry about meeting the right guy because \u201cthey hear that biological clock ticking loudly\u201d, he says. That ticking is a stress factor in their lives. By freezing their eggs and knowing that they have preserved their fertility, they can silence that ticking and receive the immediate benefit of \u201cpeace of mind\u201d. On 8 August, two days before the clinic officially opened, Beauregard was on the fourth day of her pill regiment. Beauregard has to inject herself daily with some very expensive drugs. Prior to starting the regimen, she had to come off her birth control pills, which resulted in a couple of days of feeling \u201cweepy\u201d. She is bloated and on the mornings that she goes in for checkups at Extend, she ends up watching an ultrasound of her uterus \u2013 staring at her eggs instead of a baby. However, she says, the staff at Extend have been extremely supportive. Every client is assigned their own fertility specialist and is available to accompany them to all of their meetings. The Extend office, just a block or two south of Central Park, also does not resemble a typical fertility clinic. The walls are light blue. The rooms look more like small conference rooms with round tables and a handful of chairs. There are no big tables with stirrups, no posters with uteri or models of babies nestled in a uterus. \u201cEven the way this room is set up, we are trying to build into our experience the idea that this is not an illness thing, that we are not trying to cure a disease,\u201d says Klein, sitting in one of the meeting rooms. \u201cHere we don\u2019t want to make people feel that they have a problem. They are just a woman living in the 21st century, coming to the doctor about preserving options for the future. It shouldn\u2019t feel like a problem.\u201d For some, it might be a combination of the two. A while back Beauregard was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) \u2013 an disorder that affects hormone production and can affect woman\u2019s fertility in women of reproductive age. She was 32 at that time and single. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have any plans to go out and find me a partner to have a child with,\u201d she says. She began thinking about what would happen over the next 10 years. PCOS can lead to complications during pregnancy, increased chances of miscarriage, infertility and high levels of estrogen, which can cause cancer of the uterine lining. Beauregard realized that if she wants to have children in the future, she might have to undergo treatments such as IVF at that time. \u201cI started to think about what the difference would be between now and later and the biggest difference between now and later is that after 35 my eggs start to ... age, I guess, for the lack of better term.\u201d Klein agrees. \u201cWe know without a shadow of the doubt that when you freeze eggs when you are younger, you are going to be putting away something that\u2019s much, much, much more likely to be helpful for you than if you wait to do it as a reactionary measure when you are older,\u201d he says. According to him, the profile of women interested in egg freezing is slowly shifting from \u201cpanic-mode 40-year old\u201d to \u201ca proactive smart-thing-to-do-because-I am-a-young-aspiring-woman 30-year-old\u201d. Fertility company EggBanxx, which targets younger career-focused women with slogans like \u201cLean in, but freeze first!\u201d, estimates that by 2018, 76,000 women will have frozen their eggs. Beauregard says she would have eventually considered freezing her eggs even without the PCOS diagnosis. \u201cSince I am single now I don\u2019t want to put that kind of pressure on a new relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t frozen my eggs, it would be one of the first things we talk about: \u2018Hey, how do you feel about kids? Because we have to start making decisions in the next four to five years.\u2019 I feel like a lot of pressure has been lifted off of me.\u201d The cost was the only thing that made Beauregard think twice. While researching her options, she often felt that this was a moneymaking scheme for doctors and clinics. The $5,000 price tag at Extend seemed affordable in comparison. Despite that, the procedure and the drugs cost all her savings. \u201cMost women in their mid-30s do not have a large savings to fall back on and because we do not have any other support like a partner. The big risk for me was less about the procedure and more about \u2018OK, I don\u2019t have any savings left\u2019,\u201d she says. Then laughing, she continues: \u201cThere is a risk of walking out into the world with some eggs in the bank but no money.\u201d Beauregard admits she underestimated the cost of the drugs, which she assumed would be a few hundred dollars. It turned out to be closer to a couple of thousand dollars, instead. Additionally, she has to pay for storing of her eggs. At Extend, storage for one year costs $450. For five years, it\u2019s $2,000 and $3,500 for 10. To Talia Zapolanski, freezing her eggs is akin to an insurance policy. Zapolanski, who worked in finance for 11 years and now works for a real estate investment firm, had been thinking of doing this for about a year and had gone in for a consultation at another hospital before being referred to Extend by a friend of one of the clinic\u2019s doctors. \u201cI definitely know that I want children. That\u2019s something I feel strongly about. I haven\u2019t found the right person yet. I am not dating anyone now and I don\u2019t know when I will find the right person,\u201d says the 33-year-old New Yorker. \u201cYou start hearing a lot more about egg freezing these days and I thought I would look into it. It seems like a good idea. Hopefully I will be able to, when the time comes, get pregnant and have kids the natural way but you never know.\u201d Egg freezing should not be one of those things that we don\u2019t talk about, according to both Beauregard and Zapolanski. \u201cWhen I was telling people that I was freezing my eggs, a lot of people didn\u2019t know what to say. It makes people uncomfortable \u2013 eventually they will get curious about it, but a lot of people are a little dumbfounded that I am so open about it,\u201d said Beauregard. \u201cI want to make sure that people feel comfortable talking about these options.\u201d Zapolanski says she has encouraged \u201cno less than five friends to go do the same\u201d. Recently, when she was visiting Los Angeles, she shared with a friend from college that she recently froze her eggs. \u201cShe kind of paused and looked at me in shock that I had shared that and she said: \u2018I am glad you said that, I am about to go through the process and I am so nervous about and I have nobody to talk to\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very taboo subject.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Rhiannon Beauregard, 33, is visiting New York for a few days. But the sex and marriage therapist is not here for a vacation, to see the sights or visit friends in the city where she once went to college. She is here to freeze her eggs.</p> <p>Beauregard lives in Austin, Texas where she runs her own practice, but has opted to come to New York to use the services offered by <a href=\"http://extendfertility.com/\">Extend Fertility</a>. The clinic is the first of its kind \u2013 focusing only on egg freezing and not offering any other fertility services and treatments such as in vitro fertilization. By doing that, the clinic has been able to cut costs of its services to $5,000 while offering personalized service to each one of its clients.</p> <p>One of the barriers to egg freezing becoming mainstream is the cost. The procedure was still deemed to be experimental until just a few years ago and was mostly an accepted way to extend fertility for older women, cancer patients or those diagnosed with fertility disorders. </p> <p>Since it is considered to be an elective procedure, egg freezing is typically not covered by health insurance. The average cost of the procedure is <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/freeze-eggs/\">about $10,000</a> with an additional $2,000 to $5,000 for the necessary medication and another couple of thousand dollars for storage. If the frozen eggs are actually to be used for IVF later on, that would cost <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/learnvest/2014/02/06/the-cost-of-ivf-4-things-i-learned-while-battling-infertility/#c2519092a797\">an additional $12,000</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/oct/19/silicon-valley-egg-freezing-perks-hiring-women\">Silicon Valley tries egg-freezing perks. How about just hiring more women?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Altogether, that adds up to more than $25,000 \u2013 not exactly chump change. Aware of the costs, two years ago, Facebook and Apple announced that they would cover <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/oct/14/apple-facebook-pay-women-employees-freeze-eggs\">up to $20,000 in costs</a> for any female employee that wanted to freeze their eggs.</p> <p>While Extend Fertility is unable to cut the costs of medicine (the clients are required to pay for it on their own) or the future costs of IVF, its founders hope that by cutting the cost of the initial procedure in half they will make the procedure accessible for more women. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s expensive either way. We know that,\u201d says Joshua Klein, co-founder and chief medical officer of Extend Fertility. He points out that $5,000 is still half as expensive as $10,000 and adds that the Extend is \u201cworking with financing partners\u201d so that those interested could opt to pay $200 or $300 a month for a while instead of a one-time payment. \u201cWe are trying to be innovative and thoughtful about that,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d838b809bc4ce8d45c75bc3eb3cd6f0a5b09a60a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d838b809bc4ce8d45c75bc3eb3cd6f0a5b09a60a/119_0_729_564/500.jpg\" alt=\"Joshua Klein, co-founder and chief medical officer of Extend Fertility\" width=\"500\" height=\"387\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joshua Klein, co-founder and chief medical officer of Extend Fertility.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Extend Fertility</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Should women view egg freezing as some kind of down payment on their future? Klein would prefer that they think of it an investment for both the future and the present. Many women worry about meeting the right guy because \u201cthey hear that biological clock ticking loudly\u201d, he says. That ticking is a stress factor in their lives. By freezing their eggs and knowing that they have preserved their fertility, they can silence that ticking and receive the immediate benefit of \u201cpeace of mind\u201d.</p> <p>On 8 August, two days before the clinic officially opened, Beauregard was on the fourth day of her pill regiment.</p> <p>Beauregard has to inject herself daily with some very expensive drugs. Prior to starting the regimen, she had to come off her birth control pills, which resulted in a couple of days of feeling \u201cweepy\u201d. She is bloated and on the mornings that she goes in for checkups at Extend, she ends up watching an ultrasound of her uterus \u2013 staring at her eggs instead of a baby.</p> <p>However, she says, the staff at Extend have been extremely supportive. Every client is assigned their own fertility specialist and is available to accompany them to all of their meetings. The Extend office, just a block or two south of Central Park, also does not resemble a typical fertility clinic. The walls are light blue. The rooms look more like small conference rooms with round tables and a handful of chairs. There are no big tables with stirrups, no posters with uteri or models of babies nestled in a uterus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64921b002487d0ae758c62bc86c0938846f79d25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64921b002487d0ae758c62bc86c0938846f79d25/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A meeting room at Extend Fertility.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A meeting room at Extend Fertility.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Extend Fertility</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEven the way this room is set up, we are trying to build into our experience the idea that this is not an illness thing, that we are not trying to cure a disease,\u201d says Klein, sitting in one of the meeting rooms. \u201cHere we don\u2019t want to make people feel that they have a problem. They are just a woman living in the 21st century, coming to the doctor about preserving options for the future. It shouldn\u2019t feel like a problem.\u201d</p> <p>For some, it might be a combination of the two. A while back Beauregard was diagnosed with <a href=\"http://womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/polycystic-ovary-syndrome.html\">polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS</a>) \u2013 an disorder that affects hormone production and can affect woman\u2019s fertility in women of reproductive age. She was 32 at that time and single.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really have any plans to go out and find me a partner to have a child with,\u201d she says. She began thinking about what would happen over the next 10 years. PCOS can lead to complications during pregnancy, increased chances of miscarriage, infertility and high levels of estrogen, which can cause cancer of the uterine lining.<strong> </strong>Beauregard realized that if she wants to have children in the future, she might have to undergo treatments such as IVF at that time. \u201cI started to think about what the difference would be between now and later and the biggest difference between now and later is that after 35 my eggs start to ... age, I guess, for the lack of better term.\u201d</p> <p>Klein agrees.</p> <p>\u201cWe know without a shadow of the doubt that when you freeze eggs when you are younger, you are going to be putting away something that\u2019s much, much, much more likely to be helpful for you than if you wait to do it as a reactionary measure when you are older,\u201d he says.</p> <p>According to him, the profile of women interested in egg freezing is slowly shifting from \u201cpanic-mode 40-year old\u201d to \u201ca proactive smart-thing-to-do-because-I am-a-young-aspiring-woman 30-year-old\u201d.
