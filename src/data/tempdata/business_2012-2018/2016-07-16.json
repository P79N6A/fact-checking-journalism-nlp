      "bodyText": "Brexit There is a deep split in government over the single market and whether it is a prize worth fighting for. Chancellor Philip Hammond has made it clear he believes the UK needs the same access achieved by the Norwegian and Swiss deals. The minister for Brexit, David Davis, would be content for British firms to pay tariffs to sell their goods into Europe\u2019s markets. With Brussels unwilling to countenance entry to the single market without free movement of labour, May will need to prepare the ground for a relationship based on World Trade Organisation rules in the first phase of Brexit and only later a free-trade deal that mimics the Canadian deal currently going through the European parliament. Slowing GDP growth The global economy has slowed for more than a year, hitting trade and investment. China\u2019s attempt to wean itself off manufacturing as its sole source of income has pushed down its own growth and much of the Asia region. Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector has taken the brunt of the decline. Firms in the West Midlands had begun shedding jobs long before the referendum as work dried up. The Bank of England is expected to cut interest rates and inject billions of pounds into the economy at its August meeting, helping to shore up confidence. Business investment The biggest economic fear among Remain campaigners of quitting the single market is the potential for foreign investment to dry up. Not immediately, but over a period of years as businesses face investment decisions and, without unfettered access to the single market, favour their EU subsidiaries. Companies most affected will be those that manufacture components in a supply chain where most goods are exported. Brexit campaigners have argued that funds saved from Britain\u2019s EU membership fee could be used to offer cut-price deals to foreign investors, overriding the barriers to the single market. The pound The currency has tumbled in recent weeks before settling at around $1.30 and \u20ac1.20, around 15% down on the dollar and 10% lower against the euro. The bonus for exporters is that their goods are cheaper abroad, potentially boosting sales. But it\u2019s likely that over the next year higher import costs will feed into inflation and eat into disposable incomes. That will hurt living standards and put the government in the position of cutting taxes or boosting spending to just stand still. Housing market House sales have fallen in the last six months and housebuilding growth has stalled. Commercial building has also suffered a slump. Property companies are often considered to be \u201ccanaries\u201d: early indicators of economic trouble.

The National Farmers Union has formally complained to National Trading Standards over the use of fictitious brands that it claims could mislead consumers. It cites Tesco\u2019s \u201cWoodside Farms\u201d and \u201cBoswell Farms\u201d as examples of brands which it claims could make consumers believe they are buying produce farmed in the UK. Tesco\u2019s pork products branded under the Woodside logo have been shown to come from countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark. Some beef products sold under the Boswell brand have come from Ireland. \u201cThe NFU\u2019s legal team has looked at this carefully and as a result we are asking National Trading Standards to look at whether \u2018fake\u2019 farm branding complies with the relevant legal requirements,\u201d said Meurig Raymond, the NFU president. \u201cI have spoken to senior management at Tesco to highlight our members\u2019 concerns about the use of these fake farm brands. I urge all retailers to consider seriously the results of our survey which show that mixing imported produce with British produce under the same fictional farm name can be misleading to many of their customers. I am pleased that Aldi has now made a commitment to only source British produce in their fictional farm brands by the end of March 2017.\u201d Stephen James, president of the NFU in Wales, described fake farm brands as \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. \u201cThis practice has been going on across the retail sector for a long time and enough is enough,\u201d he said. A YouGov survey commissioned by the NFU found that three in five people who said they believed such products were \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d British admitted that they would feel misled if they were informed that the product came from a country outside the UK. \u201cCountry of origin labelling is important because we know from consumer surveys that shoppers want to buy British food products,\u201d James said. \u201cClearly, consumers cannot exercise that choice without clear country of origin labelling. That\u2019s why we have now written to trading standards to argue our point and to ask for clear guidelines for retailers on the clarity of country of origin labelling.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mick Barker, a 57-year-old train driver from Luton, is Theresa May\u2019s red dream made flesh. When the prime minister-elect gave a speech on Monday to tingle Britain\u2019s socialist parts, promising to rein in corporate excess, the most eye-catching pledge from a Conservative leader was to appoint workers to the board. In one British FTSE 250 firm, employing 110,000 staff worldwide, they have already done it. Barker doubles as employee director for First Group, which runs Great Western and TransPennine railways as well as local bus services across Britain, and has had such workers\u2019 representatives on its various boards since inception. The idea was in the firm\u2019s roots as a management and worker buyout of Aberdeen\u2019s municipal bus firm in 1989. Now all of its main British businesses \u2013 12 bus firms and the two rail franchises \u2013 have their own employee director, elected by the staff. Those elected directors also vote one of their own to the group board, which is how Barker went from driving First Capital Connect trains to discussing shareholder revolts over the course of a few months in 2012. So what is it like sitting in the boardroom with millionaire American boss Tim O\u2019Toole and other First directors? \u201cThe first thing that flashes through my mind is probably almost the opposite to what flashes through most of the others\u2019 minds,\u201d Barker says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of employees \u2013 and it\u2019s the perfect chance to flag that up.\u201d But boardroom meetings, Barker stresses, are only a tiny part of his role as \u201ca bridge from the front line to board\u201d. Largely he is out and about at First\u2019s businesses, partially soliciting ideas for improving the business, partly \u201cpublicising employee benefits\u201d, including promoting share ownership (Barker holds 60,000) and the idea of employee directorships itself. \u201cI spend more of my own time at ground level,\u201d he says. \u201cParticularly when there\u2019s a local employee director election \u2013 to ensure they are aware of the role and the good it can do. It\u2019s spreading information to ensure the troops understand what\u2019s going on at board level and why decisions are being made \u2013 and the board get a first-class understanding of what\u2019s going on at the frontline.\u201d That kind of time, at larger subsidiary such as First Manchester, would see Barker spend a week visiting \u201cevery depot at 5am when all the drivers will be there, then the engineers, and work out the best time to get to the cleaners, handing out my details to everyone\u201d. The result is that 25,000 UK employees have his mobile number. A First Group spokesman said that the practice is far from any tokenist industrial relations and has been \u201cextremely beneficial\u201d for the company\u2019s success. Barker has the same voice and voting powers as other directors and he affirms: \u201cI\u2019m invited to speak on any subject and I get just as involved as anyone else.\u201d First Group says that the role is complementary to the work of unions and its own HR department. Employee directors cannot be trade union officials (though Barker was once an Aslef rep), an exclusion designed to ensure that pay negotiations and grievances are still held with unions, rather than to weed out the lefties. Unions are broadly supportive of the structure. The TUC says laws requiring workers to have a seat on company boards exist in 19 countries across Europe, even if most only associate them with Germany, which recently marked the 40th anniversary of Mitbestimmung, or co-determination, being enshrined in legislation. General secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: \u201cFirst Group should serve as an example to other employers. Having workers on boards makes good business sense. Employees have a clear interest in the long-term success of their companies and are a vital link to the shop floor.\u201d Barker, meanwhile, said he had already developed a skin thick enough to deal with comments from colleagues about \u201cchanging sides \u2013 though in jest and mischief\u201d. He admits, though, that he may be regarded by some staff and unions as onside and by others with suspicion. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of both: the general secretary of Aslef [Mick Whelan] calls me comrade director.\u201d While his predecessor, a ticket inspector, kept the day job, the particular circumstances of Barker\u2019s career \u2013 having to retrain on a new route when First lost its Thameslink franchise during his first term in the post \u2013 means that he is currently working full-time in the employee director role, for which he is paid \u00a339,000 on top of his normal earnings as a driver. But he plans to return to driving when, under company statutes, he has seen out a maximum third three-year term (if re-elected next year). Will he miss the director job? \u201cIt\u2019s been a hell of an education, but it\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s for the employees.\u201d Yet the train cab may not hold the same appeal now, you suspect, for Barker, who started in an Essex depot as a driver\u2019s assistant for British Rail in 1976. He will only add: \u201cI\u2019ve been driving trains a long time.\u201d Years of taking collective responsibility for boardroom decisions as a director while being a worker\u2019s representative appear to have left him with the politician\u2019s knack for tightrope diplomacy and carefully chosen words. But perhaps his ultimate allegiance is revealed with his parting salvo, as he turns with a broad grin: \u201cWatch what you write... 0r I\u2019ll set Whelan on you.\u201d",

He admits, though, that he may be regarded by some staff and unions as onside and by others with suspicion. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of both: the general secretary of Aslef [Mick Whelan] calls me comrade director.\u201d</p> <p>While his predecessor, a ticket inspector, kept the day job, the particular circumstances of Barker\u2019s career \u2013 having to retrain on a new route when First lost its Thameslink franchise during his first term in the post \u2013 means that he is currently working full-time in the employee director role, for which he is paid \u00a339,000 on top of his normal earnings as a driver. But he plans to return to driving when, under company statutes, he has seen out a maximum third three-year term (if re-elected next year).</p> <p>Will he miss the director job? \u201cIt\u2019s been a hell of an education, but it\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s for the employees.\u201d Yet the train cab may not hold the same appeal now, you suspect, for Barker, who started in an Essex depot as a driver\u2019s assistant for British Rail in 1976. He will only add: \u201cI\u2019ve been driving trains a long time.\u201d</p> <p>Years of taking collective responsibility for boardroom decisions as a director while being a worker\u2019s representative appear to have left him with the politician\u2019s knack for tightrope diplomacy and carefully chosen words. But perhaps his ultimate allegiance is revealed with his parting salvo, as he turns with a broad grin: \u201cWatch what you write... 0r I\u2019ll set Whelan on you.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May signalled a sharp change in direction for the Conservative government when she set out her economic agenda. For one thing, the sacking of George Osborne made it clear that austerity was for the history books. She vented her frustration at the lack of an industrial policy and also acknowledged that ordinary working people were angry at the way corporate executives paid themselves lavish salaries while ignoring the concerns of local communities and the demands of shareholders. In a speech that echoed many of the points made by Labour\u2019s Ed Miliband in the 2015 election, she said: \u201cWe need to reform the economy to allow more people to share in the country\u2019s prosperity. We need to put people back in control of their lives. We need to give more people more opportunity. And we need to get tough on irresponsible behaviour in big business.\u201d There will still be cuts to welfare spending pencilled into budgets until 2020 and hard-pressed councils can expect little favour from chancellor Philip Hammond. Moreover, May\u2019s support for a co-ordinated effort to drive up the UK\u2019s skills base and productive capacity is largely in line with Osborne\u2019s previous approach. But what will mark out her administration from those covering the last six years, according to experts, will be more direct action. Will she sanction raising \u00a3100bn or more in government-backed infrastructure bonds? And will she implement new rules enforcing executive pay restraint, with sanctions for those who ignore them? Simon Walker, head of the Institute of Directors, says he wants businesses to heed May\u2019s warning and implement the spirit of her demands without waiting for legislation: \u201cBusiness needs to bloody act fast because rules on this always tend to have perverse outcomes.\u201d Here we examine the main areas put forward by May as being central to her vision for a better economy. Industrial policy May has put industrial policy in the hands of Greg Clark, who will head the new Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy department. Clark, the MP for Tunbridge Wells, has a reputation as a smart operator, but is largely unknown outside Westminster. There is scope for a coordinated effort between Clark, Hammond and Bank of England governor Mark Carney to kickstart a national infrastructure building programme with money borrowed from Threadneedle Street at ultra-low interest rates. Under this scheme, which is being openly talked about inside Westminster, more than \u00a3100bn could be borrowed to improve road, rail, power generation and digital infrastructure. Sir Keith Burnett, vice-chancellor of Sheffield University and a member of the Council for Science and Technology reporting to the prime minister, says: \u201cIf you ask a company what they need, it is orders. Once they have an order they can put in place the staff training and develop the technology and processes they need. It is the orders for high quality work that are lacking.\u201d Burnett says there are huge savings to be made if May can confront government antipathy to state funding. The UK often pays double what it needs to for infrastructure, behaving like a poverty-stricken consumer who must buy their furniture on hire purchase, he says. \u201cWhy on earth are we going into partnership with private contractors that charge an arm and a leg in debt interest and servicing costs when the government can finance projects with money borrowed for next to nothing on the international debt markets?\u201d He points out that the interest rate on UK government borrowing has tumbled to an all-time low as investors seek a safe haven for their funds. Skills training could also be supported with more money. Last November, Osborne whacked businesses with an apprenticeship levy, which critics warned was a tax on wage bills, to raise \u00a311.6bn over the next five years. It is supposed to pay for 3 million apprenticeships over the course of the parliament. This could be backed with more cash from the Skills Funding Agency or, following greater devolution, from local councils\u2019 training budgets. Worker representation British business leaders have long argued that they must be free to make decisions quickly and decisively without the involvement of worker representatives. But if the plan to have rank-and-file voices in boardrooms goes ahead, there are many models to choose from across the continent. Denmark, for example, requires worker representation if a company has 35 or more employees; Austria has a threshold of 300 staff for limited companies; while France sets the lower limit at 1,000. There are plenty of reports arguing that strategic decisions in the boardroom would be improved by worker representation. Matt Lawrence, a research fellow at the IPPR thinktank, says it is important to slow down strategic decision-making and avoid \u201cgroupthink\u201d. \u201cIt is useful for a company to have some grit in the wheels that allows time to think. Being streamlined and fast-moving can often lead to bad decisions being made,\u201d he says. May said: \u201cThe people who run big businesses are supposed to be accountable to outsiders, to non-executive directors who are supposed to ask the difficult questions, think about the long-term and defend the interests of shareholders. In practice, they are drawn from the same, narrow social and professional circles as the executive team and \u2013 as we have seen time and time again \u2013 the scrutiny they provide is just not good enough.\u201d This debate has been around for years: whether to professionalise non-executives, and how to expand the pool of people who put themselves forward for the role. There are thousands of such posts, from pension fund trustees to school governors, where this question has been asked, with no clear answer forthcoming; Nida Broughton, chief economist at the Social Market Foundation, says May has shown her lack of corporate experience in asking the question in such a naive way. Likewise, it would be difficult to impose consumer representation on boards where a business only sells to other businesses; but it would seem unfair to target only retailers and other firms that trade directly with ordinary shoppers. Binding votes on board pay May said: \u201cI want to make shareholder votes on corporate pay not just advisory but binding. I want to see more transparency, including the full disclosure of bonus targets and the publication of \u2018pay multiple\u2019 data: that is, the ratio between the CEO\u2019s pay and the average company worker\u2019s pay. \u201cAnd I want to simplify the way bonuses are paid so that bosses\u2019 incentives are better aligned with the long-term interests of the company.\u201d Broughton says the coalition government examined most of the options for increasing shareholder power and restraining high pay. \u201cAll these proposals hark back to Vince Cable\u2019s efforts, which were mostly blocked by the Tory-dominated cabinet. He also came under pressure from companies that said waiting until an annual general meeting to know how much the boss can be paid adds to uncertainty and costs. This problem multiplies should the new rules go beyond just the chief executive to the board.\u201d Tougher corporate law May promised a crackdown on individual and corporate tax avoidance and evasion \u2013 naming Amazon, Google and Starbucks as companies who had a \u201cresponsibility to pay your taxes\u201d. Google executives met ministers 25 times over 18 months before agreeing earlier this year to pay \u00a3130m to cover 10 years of taxes, from 2005 to 2015. Financial statements published in January showed that Google\u2019s UK sales rose by 16%, to $1.9bn, in the last three months of 2015, giving an effective tax rate of around 3%. Without a tougher stance \u2013 like that adopted by the Spanish and French administrations, which have raided offices in search of tax documents \u2013 May is unlikely to make much progress. May was also keen to block foreign takeovers where tax avoidance was the main aim. She said: \u201cA proper industrial strategy wouldn\u2019t automatically stop the sale of British firms to foreign ones, but it should be capable of stepping in to defend a sector that is as important as pharmaceuticals is to Britain.\u201d",
