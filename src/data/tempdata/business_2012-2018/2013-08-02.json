There's something wrong, surely, when listing houses on a website makes you almost as big as the biggest builder of homes.</p> <p>That 73% profit margin is the measure to watch. No company ever sustains such levels for long because it invites competition. In Rightmove's case, the opposition has consolidated under the banner of Zoopla. The challenger may or may not achieve its ambition of becoming number one but, in the process of trying, it will probably dent Rightmove's profit margins.</p> <p>Poor old Anthony Codling at broker Jefferies has been making a similar argument since Rightmove's shares were \u00a315.

    "webTitle": "BT and Vodafone among telecoms companies passing details to GCHQ", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Some of the world's leading telecoms firms, including BT and Vodafone, are secretly collaborating with Britain's spy agency GCHQ, and are passing on details of their customers' phone calls, email messages and Facebook entries, documents leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden show. BT, Vodafone Cable, and the American firm Verizon Business \u2013 together with four other smaller providers \u2013 have given GCHQ secret unlimited access to their network of undersea cables. The cables carry much of the world's phone calls and internet traffic. In June the Guardian revealed details of GCHQ's ambitious data-hoovering programmes, Mastering the Internet and Global Telecoms Exploitation, aimed at scooping up as much online and telephone traffic as possible. It emerged GCHQ was able to tap into fibre-optic cables and store huge volumes of data for up to 30 days. That operation, codenamed Tempora, has been running for 20 months. On Friday Germany's S\u00fcddeutsche newspaper published the most highly sensitive aspect of this operation \u2013 the names of the commercial companies working secretly with GCHQ, and giving the agency access to their customers' private communications. The paper said it had seen a copy of an internal GCHQ powerpoint presentation from 2009 discussing Tempora. The document identified for the first time which telecoms companies are working with GCHQ's \"special source\" team. It gives top secret codenames for each firm, with BT (\"Remedy\"), Verizon Business (\"Dacron\"), and Vodafone Cable (\"Gerontic\"). The other firms include Global Crossing (\"Pinnage\"), Level 3 (\"Little\"), Viatel (\"Vitreous\") and Interoute (\"Streetcar\"). The companies refused to comment on any specifics relating to Tempora, but several noted they were obliged to comply with UK and EU law. The revelations are likely to dismay GCHQ and Downing Street, who are fearful that BT and the other firms will suffer a backlash from customers furious that their private data and intimate emails have been secretly passed to a government spy agency. In June a source with knowledge of intelligence said the companies had no choice but to co-operate in this operation. They are forbidden from revealing the existence of warrants compelling them to allow GCHQ access to the cables. Together, these seven companies operate a huge share of the high-capacity undersea fibre-optic cables that make up the backbone of the internet's architecture. GCHQ's mass tapping operation has been built up over the past five years by attaching intercept probes to the transatlantic cables where they land on British shores. GCHQ's station in Bude, north Cornwall, plays a role. The cables carry data to western Europe from telephone exchanges and internet servers in north America. This allows GCHQ and NSA analysts to search vast amounts of data on the activity of millions of internet users. Metadata \u2013 the sites users visit, whom they email, and similar information \u2013 is stored for up to 30 days, while the content of communications is typically stored for three days. GCHQ has the ability to tap cables carrying both internet data and phone calls. By last year GCHQ was handling 600m \"telephone events\" each day, had tapped more than 200 fibre-optic cables and was able to process data from at least 46 of them at a time. Each of the cables carries data at a rate of 10 gigabits per second, so the tapped cables had the capacity, in theory, to deliver more than 21 petabytes a day \u2013 equivalent to sending all the information in all the books in the British Library 192 times every 24 hours. This operation is carried out under clandestine agreements with the seven companies, described in one document as \"intercept partners\". The companies are paid for logistical and technical assistance. The identity of the companies allowing GCHQ to tap their cables was regarded as extremely sensitive within the agency. Though the Tempora programme itself was classified as top secret, the identities of the cable companies was even more secret, referred to as \"exceptionally controlled information\", with the company names replaced with the codewords, such as \"GERONTIC\", \"REMEDY\" and \"PINNAGE\". However, some documents made it clear which codenames referred to which companies. GCHQ also assigned the firms \"sensitive relationship teams\". One document warns that if the names emerged it could cause \"high-level political fallout\". Germans have been enraged by the revelations of spying by the National Security Agency and GCHQ after it emerged that both agencies were hoovering up German data as well. On Friday the S\u00fcddeutsche said it was now clear that private telecoms firms were far more deeply complicit in US-UK spying activities than had been previously thought. The source familiar with intelligence maintained in June that GCHQ was \"not looking at every piece of straw\" but was sifting a \"vast haystack of data\" for what he called \"needles\". He added: \"If you had the impression we are reading millions of emails, we are not. There is no intention in this whole programme to use it for looking at UK domestic traffic \u2013 British people talking to each other.\" The source said analysts used four criteria for determining what was examined: security, terror, organised crime and Britain's economic wellbeing.\"The vast majority of the data is discarded without being looked at \u2026 we simply don't have the resources.\" Nonetheless, the agency repeatedly referred to plans to expand this collection ability still further in the future. Once it is collected, analysts are able to search the information for emails, online chats and browsing histories using an interface called XKeyscore, uncovered in the Guardian on Wednesday. By May 2012, 300 analysts from GCHQ and 250 NSA analysts had direct access to search and sift through the data collected under the Tempora program. Documents seen by the Guardian suggest some telecoms companies allowed GCHQ to access cables which they did not themselves own or operate, but only operated a landing station for. Such practices could raise alarm among other cable providers who do not co-operate with GCHQ programmes that their facilities are being used by the intelligence agency. Telecoms providers can be compelled to co-operate with requests from the government, relayed through ministers, under the 1984 Telecommunications Act, but privacy advocates have raised concerns that the firms are not doing enough to challenge orders enabling large-scale surveillance, or are co-operating to a degree beyond that required by law. \"We urgently need clarity on how close the relationship is between companies assisting with intelligence gathering and government,\" said Eric King, head of research for Privacy International. \"Were the companies strong-armed, or are they voluntary intercept partners?\" Vodafone said it complied with the laws of all the countries in which its cables operate. \"Media reports on these matters have demonstrated a misunderstanding of the basic facts of European, German and UK legislation and of the legal obligations set out within every telecommunications operator's licence \u2026 Vodafone complies with the law in all of our countries of operation,\" said a spokesman. \"Vodafone does not disclose any customer data in any jurisdiction unless legally required to do so. Questions related to national security are a matter for governments not telecommunications operators.\" A spokeswoman for Interoute said: \"As with all communication providers in Europe we are required to comply with European and local laws including those on data protection and retention. From time to time we are presented with requests from authorities. When we receive such requests, they are processed by our legal and security teams and if valid, acted upon.\" A spokeswoman for Verizon said: \"Verizon continually takes steps to safeguard our customers' privacy. Verizon also complies with the law in every country in which we operate.\" BT declined to comment.",

Here, two economists give their take:</p> <p><strong>Robert Wood at Berenberg</strong> </p> <blockquote> <p>What a week; the UK is surging and George Osborne must be beaming like a Cheshire cat while on his holidays....So what does this avalanche of good news mean? The bottom line is that stimulus is working and confidence is returning, not just in the UK but in our major export markets too. While interest rates have been held at low levels for several years by the Bank of England, that had not fully fed through to households until recently. But following the BoE\u2019s Funding for Lending scheme, and [European Central Bank boss Mario] Draghi\u2019s all important words last summer, mortgage rates have tumbled and credit availability has improved. We expect the recovery to step onto firmer footing next year, as growth sets off a virtuous circle that results in rising real wages and a return of business investment.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>More good news for the UK economy, with the construction sector seemingly increasingly shrugging off its long-term problems and now contributing to growth. This is significant as the construction sector has been a recent serious drag on UK economic activity despite its relatively small size.</p> <p>With the purchasing managers reporting that both manufacturing and construction activity improved markedly further in July, it is looking ever more likely that the economy can achieve further decent growth in the third quarter after GDP growth doubled to 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first. A robust July purchasing managers\u2019 survey for the dominant services sector (out on Monday) would really help matters further.</p> <p>In our August forecast, we are lifting our projection for UK GDP growth to 1.2% in 2013 and 1.9% in 2014.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the respected National Institute for Economic and Social Research thinktank still thinks the government could do more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/02/think-tank-revise-uk-output-up\">to boost investment</a>. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51fb9e28e4b0782a5bd3f369\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-02T11:55:20.701Z\">12.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Crisis over' says Bank of Ireland</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Bank of Ireland, 15% owned by the taxpayer, is on the mend, according to its boss.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/financial-services/bank-of-ireland-says-its-four-year-crisis-is-over-1.1482798\"><em>Irish Times</em></a> reports, chief executive Richie Boucher said:</p> <blockquote> <p>We now have a normalised bank which has strong momentum towards profitability...

But what he did not know was that the cameras installed to broadcast the verdict were rolling... Hat tip to the Guardian's Southern Europe editor John Hooper And on that note, I am closing the blog. Thank you for following and have a good weekend. After a day of drama in Italy, the focus is moving sharply back to Spain, after the International Monetary Fund issued a bleak report on the outlook for the country's jobless -see 15.48 The IMF's warning of five years' of unemployment above 25% certainly puts into perspective official data - 10.13 - that joblessness is falling. In fact, taking into account Spain's big tourist industry, the seasonally-adjusted unemployment number is up. It was a quiet day on European markets, as Italy and the rest of Europe puzzled over what the criminal conviction of Silvio Berlusconi means for the future of the coalition government. The future for Enrico Letta's coalition looks fragile, but the investors don't seem too worried that the eurozone's 3rd largest economy will tip into crisis, not yet anyway. Giordano Lombardo, chief investment officer of Pioneer Investments in Milan. \"We definitely look at the political scenario while investing but we are not particularly concerned about the situation in Italy because we believe there are very few alternatives to the current government.\" The biggest surprise was the slowdown in US job creation - see 3.15. The UK had a batch of positive economic data - 9.58, 11.22 - but fears of a housing bubble continue to swirl. I'll be signing of soon, but one last post... Unemployment in Spain could be stuck above 25% for another 5 years, the International Monetary Fund has warned, as it calls for urgent action to get the eurozone's 4th largest economy moving again. The IMF report notes that the increase in the unemployment rate to 27% is \"unprecedented in Spain\u2019s history\" and disproportionately hitting temporary workers and the young - an incredible 57% young people were out of work at the start of the year. For an official report, it has come out with some hard-hitting lines: \"The outlook is difficult and risks are high.\" The IMF is urging the Spain's eurozone partners to get a move on with the banking union that will help Spain get out of the crisis, as well as measures to get lending started. Europe should move faster to full banking union and the ECB implement further measures to reduce the much higher borrowing costs of Spain\u2019s private sector. Here is the Guardian's story on the US job data: Economics editor Larry Elliott reports that the unemployment rate is the lowest since the global recession was at its most intense in the winter of 2008-09, but part of the drop was due to some Americans leaving the labour market after giving up hope of finding work. Here is more from his story: James Knightly, economist at ING bank, said the markets had been hoping for a stronger report after upbeat US GDP data earlier in the week, which saw the economy grow by 1.7% in the second quarter. He said it appeared to have \"taken the wind out of the sails of those heavily backing a September start to quantitative easing tapering. Additionally, wages fell 0.1% on the month, the first fall since last October. This takes the year-on-year growth in wages down to 1.9% and is not indicative of a tight labour market.\" The folks at Open Europe have crunched through the latest International Monetary Fund review of the Greek bailout, released on Wednesday. Here are a few of their highlights from the 207-page IMF report. As also might be expected the press has focused on the fact that the report reveals an \u20ac11bn funding gap for Greece between 2014 and 2016 (higher than that suggested by the eurozone). The report also calls for the eurozone to consider further debt relief for Greece. Neither of these revelations is brand new, with both having been included in the leaked version of the Troika report a few weeks ago.... The real question facing Greece and the eurozone (after the German elections) is whether to write down these \u2018official creditors\u2019 or not \u2013 known as \u2018official sector involvement\u2019 (OSI). There will likely be a push to extend the loans further and cut their interest rates but, as the funding gap highlights, there are immediate liquidity and solvency questions facing Greece. They also note that the IMF is warning of further social unrest: The risk of political instability remains acute, especially in light of high unemployment and on-going social hardship. Further ambitious fiscal adjustment is needed for public sector debt to decline steadily, which exacerbates the possibility of social stress and political resistance. Brent crude futures have dropped 83 cents to $108.71, after the lower than expected fall in US unemployment. See 13.43 and 13.46. The FT has an eye-opening article on the 2014 winter Olympic games in Sochi. So far, the bill stands at $51bn (\u00a333bn) and many fear the only winners will be friends of the Kremlin, the paper writes. By contrast, the over-budget London 2012 games were \u00a39bn. From the FT story (metred paywall) To bring tourists from the airport to the ski slopes in 40 minutes, for example, is a 48km road and railway that cost more than $8bn, one of the most expensive such transport links in the world. \u201cIt would be cheaper to build the road with solid gold or caviar,\u201d quipped Yulia Latynina, a Moscow talk radio host. It is worth remembering that Russia has the G20 presidency, so in theory, is in charge of its crackdown on tax avoidance and \"boosting sustainable, inclusive and balanced growth and jobs creation around the world\". The US job numbers are out and fall below expectations. The number of jobs outside the farming sector increased by 162,000 in July, below forecasts that spanned a range from 180,000-210,000. The jobless rate fell anyway to 7.4%, its lowest in 4 years. More to follow... As one bailed-out UK bank get a new boss - see 8.59 on Royal Bank of Scotland - so the betting begins on when the UK government will cash in its shares in another and how long privatisation will take. The Treasury is anxious to sell off the 39% stake that the taxpayer owns in Lloyds Bank. Yesterday the bank's boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, whose bonus is linked to the sale, challenged them to do just that. Here are the odds bookmaker Paddy Power are offering: When will the government sell 25% or more of its Lloyds Banking Group stake shares? 7/4 Q3 2013 4/1 Q4 2013 8/1 Q1 2014 8/1 Q2 2014 8/1 Q3 2014 8/1 Q4 2014 2/1 Not before 2015 When will the government have disposed of all of its Lloyds Banking Group Shares? 9/2 2013 2/1 2014 4/6 Not before 2015 It has been a busy week for economic data in the UK. Here, two economists give their take: Robert Wood at Berenberg What a week; the UK is surging and George Osborne must be beaming like a Cheshire cat while on his holidays....So what does this avalanche of good news mean? The bottom line is that stimulus is working and confidence is returning, not just in the UK but in our major export markets too. While interest rates have been held at low levels for several years by the Bank of England, that had not fully fed through to households until recently. But following the BoE\u2019s Funding for Lending scheme, and [European Central Bank boss Mario] Draghi\u2019s all important words last summer, mortgage rates have tumbled and credit availability has improved. We expect the recovery to step onto firmer footing next year, as growth sets off a virtuous circle that results in rising real wages and a return of business investment. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight More good news for the UK economy, with the construction sector seemingly increasingly shrugging off its long-term problems and now contributing to growth. This is significant as the construction sector has been a recent serious drag on UK economic activity despite its relatively small size. With the purchasing managers reporting that both manufacturing and construction activity improved markedly further in July, it is looking ever more likely that the economy can achieve further decent growth in the third quarter after GDP growth doubled to 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first. A robust July purchasing managers\u2019 survey for the dominant services sector (out on Monday) would really help matters further. In our August forecast, we are lifting our projection for UK GDP growth to 1.2% in 2013 and 1.9% in 2014. But the respected National Institute for Economic and Social Research thinktank still thinks the government could do more to boost investment. The Bank of Ireland, 15% owned by the taxpayer, is on the mend, according to its boss. As the Irish Times reports, chief executive Richie Boucher said: We now have a normalised bank which has strong momentum towards profitability... We are in the more pleasant place of having the challenges of ordinary businessmen and women. Net losses for the first half of the year have fallen to *only* \u20ac455m (\u00a3396m) from \u20ac1.1bn a year ago. Optimism is fizzing in the US markets this morning, ahead of jobs data to be released in just under an hour. The dollar has extended its gains against the yen, while the Dow Jones index has opened up 0.83%. The non-farm payroll data will show how many new jobs were created in July. Economists - being economists - have come up with a range of predictions, from a below-average 180,000 new jobs to a confidence-boosting 210,000. As the Wall Street Journal's MarketWatch explains: In the first half of 2013, the US has created an average of slightly more than 200,000 jobs a month. That\u2019s the best stretch of job creation to start a year since 2005, but still not fast enough to rapidly reduce the nation\u2019s persistently high unemployment. Still, the jobless rate, which stood 7.6% in June, could fall a notch to 7.5% in July, economists say. Greece's debt agency has announced that it will auction \u20ac625m (\u00a3412m) of six-month treasury bills on August 6 to roll over its maturing debts. This comes one day after Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, expressed confidence that Greece's eurozone partners would help Greece lower its debts. Speaking in Washington, she said: I stand on the three-times repeated commitments by the euro partners to consider further measures and assistance to make sure that the Greek debt is reduced substantially. I have no reason to believe the Europeans would not themselves deliver on their undertaking vis-a-vis Greece and vis-a-vis third parties. Open Europe has a good blog post outlining the dilemma faced by Italy's prime minister Enrico Letta. If the Democratic Party votes to expel Berlusconi, it will put Italy's coalition government at risk; If the Democratic Party votes to keep Berlusconi in, it will put itself at risk of internal strains and criticism from angry voters. It would also provide a boost to Beppe Grillo's anti-establishment rhetoric. A few reactions on what the \"earthquake\" of Berlusconi's conviction means for Italy. Giovanni Orsina, professor of contemporary history at LUISS Guido Carli: I expect a lot of quake tremors in the next few days, but I think that the government will survive. Paolo Flores d\u2019Arcais, the editor of the left-wing monthly magazine MicroMega: For the left it doesn\u2019t mean anything because the left doesn\u2019t exist... \u201cIf Italy were a normal country, it would obviously be a new chapter. But if Italy were a normal country this would never have happened because Berlusconi wasn\u2019t electable.\u201d Both quotes from the New York Times Berenberg economists: The key this autumn will be whether the centre-left... will decide to continue the coalition or go for new elections. It knows that new elections can be risky, spook markets and delay recovery. From Reuters More on those blockbuster UK construction numbers - see 9.45. The Guardian's economics correspondent Phillip Inman reports that the whole construction sector has grown, but housebuilding led the way. The Treasury's controversial Help to Buy scheme, which kicked off earlier this year, is certainly at work. This has been cited by housebuilders as a key reason for a rise in demand for new homes, but many fear it could create another housing bubble. As Phillip writes: But there are still concerns in the industry that prices will race ahead of the industry's capacity to complete homes, driving up prices. Help to Buy, which underwrites the deposits of homebuyers, has proved especially controversial. Some economists have called it \"crazy\" and accused the government of attempting to create a house price feelgood factor ahead of the 2015 election. The knives are out in the rarified world of central banking, as the US Federal Reserve hits out at the European Central Bank for creating a debt crisis that could have been avoided. A paper from the Richmond Fed accuses the ECB of policy \"incoherence\" and misunderstanding the crisis, the Daily Telegraph reports. The Fed want the Europeans to print more money - quantitative easing \u2013 to help restore the Eurozone economy to growth. Here are the key lines from the Telegraph's report: \u201cThe ECB lacks a coherent strategy for creating the monetary base required to sustain the money creation necessary for a growing economy,\u201d said the paper, written in July by Robert Hetzel, the bank\u2019s senior economist. It called for direct action to buy \u201cbundles\u201d of small business loans, as well as \u201cpackages of government debt\u201d across EMU states, including German Bunds. \u201cThe ECB will have to be clear that surplus countries will experience inflation above 2pc for extended periods of time,\u201d and must be prepared to \u201cexplain to the German public\u201d that this is desirable. \u201cMost important, the ECB needs to start by recognising that Europe\u2019s problems are more than structural. It needs to stop using monetary policy as a lever for achieving structural changes and to end its contractionary policy.\u201d The ECB doesn't seem to think this is good advice. Yesterday the bank left rates unchanged at 0.5%, while ECB president Mario Draghi said there were signs of \"gradual recovery\" in 2014. After a day of high drama in Rome, Italian markets have greeted the conviction of Silvio Berlusconi with a muted response. The Italian stock market opened flat on Friday, although shares in the former prime minister's Mediaset fell 4%. And the spread with German Bunds - the premium Italy pays on its debt - has actually narrowed to its lowest point since early June. Market analysts have already priced in the Berlusconi factor. Chris Clark at ICAP: The market was very much prepared for the uncertainty surrounding this verdict and so far there has been no sign that the government, which is already weak, is facing any imminent threat. Matthias Thiel at Hamburg-based M.M. Warburg: Berlusconi is a factor but for us at the moment it's more important that there are early signs of Italy gaining economic momentum. Quotes via Reuters The number of Spaniards out of work has fallen by 1.4% in July from one month earlier, leaving 4.7m out of work, according to the Labour ministry. This is the fifth straight month of falling unemployment according to official data - but let's not get carried away. Not everyone is convinced by the official data... With an unemployment rate of 26.3% and other surveys suggesting 6m are looking for a job, Spain's economy remains one of Europe's most disastrous - and that is against some stiff competition. Another snippet of economic good news from the UK. Personal insolvenices fell 6% in England and Wales, reaching 25,717 in the second quarter of 2013 compared to one year ago. The UK is building again: data from Markit shows that the construction sector expanded at its fastest since June 2010. Markit's purchasing managers' index has shot up to 57 for July, compared to 51 in June. Anything above 50 means growth. A fairly unexciting day on European stock markets so far: FTSE 100 -0.14% 6,672 CAC 40 +0.02 4,043 DAX 40 +0.13 8,421 But Royal Bank of Scotland shares are down 5% on the appointment of new chief executive Ross McEwan. Surely Silvio Berlusconi could not make a political comeback? Alberto Nardelli raises the possibility that the centre-right media mogul could, in theory, be prime minister again. Even if he were ineligible, there is technically nothing that would stop Berlusconi leading the centre-right in an election campaign without running for office, and with parliamentary majorities laws can be changed. With ineligibility out of the way and a parliamentary majority, Berlusconi could, technically at least, even be PM. But perhaps the key issue is the Senate vote that will decide whether Berlusconi must stand down immediately from political office, or whether he can hang on until the end of this political term. This vote in September or October \"is bound to divide the coalition partners ferociously,\" Nardelli writes. He failed his accounting module twice and he has already given up his bonus for 2014. Ross McEwan takes on the politically-charged job of Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive, after joining the bank one year ago, following a successful business career in his native New Zealand. My colleague Jill Treanor has written a profile of the man who is \"more comfortable with people than figures\". Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. It has taken 20 years of legal battles, but the law has finally caught up with Silvio Berlusconi. Italy\u2019s Supreme Court ruling upheld Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s conviction for tax fraud, plunges the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy back into political turmoil. \u201cHis conviction is like the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989,\u201d said Beppe Grillo, leader of the anti-establishment 5-star movement and fierce Berlusconi critic. The 76-year old billionaire is unlikely to serve any time in jail, but even under house arrest or doing community service, the former prime minister could still bring down the fragile coalition government led by Enrico Letta. Since April, Letta has united his centre-left Democratic party with Berlusconi\u2019s PdL in an uncomfortable coalition, but now its days seem numbered. The Guardian\u2019s Lizzy Davies in Rome reports: \u201cEven as Letta appealed in a statement for \"a climate of serenity\", the huge pressure that the conviction will place on his government was starting to show. Government under secretary Michaela Biancofiore, a member of the PdL, was reported to have said she would be resigning in protest at the verdict. Luca d'Alessandro, a PdL MP and secretary of the lower house of parliament's justice commission, said: \"This country was famous for being the cradle of the law. Today it has become its tomb run by a corporation of grave diggers in gowns who have carried out the perfect crime. Honour and solidarity with Silvio Berlusconi, who is certainly more innocent and clean than those who unjustly convicted him.\" But the verdict was thought likely to prompt equally strong reactions within Letta's centre-left Democratic Party (PD), many of whose members were already squeamish about joining forces with their political b\u00eate noire and may draw the line at continuing in a coalition with a convicted criminal. Immediately after the verdict, Nichi Vendola, head of the opposition Left Ecology Freedom party, said it was \"not possible\" for the coalition to continue. Here in the UK, Ross McEwan, a little known New Zealander, has been named boss of Royal Bank Scotland. McEwan joined the 81%-taxpayer owned bank a year ago and takes over from Stephen Hester, who was pushed out by the Treasury. And we have US non-farm payroll data for July out later. I\u2019ll be tracking events in the eurozone and beyond throughout the day...",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Willie Walsh has said that British Airways' Spanish sister airline Iberia had turned the corner, despite continued losses dragging the parent group \u20ac500m into the red in the first half of 2013. The International Airlines Group (IAG) chief executive said a significantly improved performance and huge layoffs were putting Iberia en route to profitability. IAG, which recently acquired the Spanish carrier Vueling, made a pre-tax loss of \u20ac506m (\u00a3442m) in the six months to 30 June. The last quarter showed a marked upturn, and excluding \"exceptional items\" such as restructuring costs as Iberia cut its fleet and made 1,700 staff redundant, the airline's losses were down to \u20ac33m over the past three months. BA's operating profits rose to \u20ac247m in the same quarter. Walsh said a strong London economy, and transatlantic traffic were the basis for BA's success, but the airline also had good results in the short-haul leisure market, improving at Gatwick with the introduction of reduced, hand baggage-only fares. Walsh said the main improvement was at Iberia. \"We've definitely turned the corner. There's a big transformation going on there.\" He said 2,400 employees would have left Iberia by the end of the year, but added: \"Significantly they're also improving their commercial performance \u2013 it's not just the cost base.\" He said Iberia's revamped website was driving sales, improving both revenue and costs. Vueling contributed \u20ac27m operating profit in just over two months. Walsh said it would continue expanding into Germany, Scandinavia, Greece, and \"a little\" in Britain. He said the airline had a lower cost base than most low-cost carriers \u2013 bar Ryanair \u2013 with a \"superior offering\". Walsh confirmed he would not want to buy Aer Lingus, recently advertised as for sale by Ryanair, which has a 29% holding. He said Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary was \"trying to drive up the value of the shareholding\", adding: \"I think [O'Leary] is clearly making the strongest case he can possibly make that he should be allowed to retain his stake in Aer Lingus. It's a very smart solution to the challenge that the competition commission have put there. He's just called everyone's bluff\". Walsh again criticised Heathrow, in the continuing standoff over airport charges. The London airport has asked the regulator to raise landing charges above inflation for the next five years, arguing that shareholders need better returns. Walsh said its recently revised offer was not credible, adding: \"They've made more than adequate returns for their shareholders. Their costs are the highest of any hub. They have plenty of scope for efficiencies and if they want to invest they will get more than adequate returns. It's not a credible proposal at all.\" The IAG boss also had uncomfortable words for the other airports that submitted expansion plans to the Airports Commission last month. While he praised the work of Howard Davies and the commission, Walsh said: \"It doesn't matter how good it is or how clear and unambiguous the recommendations are, [the report] will be handed to politicians who won't act on it. It will sit on a shelf gathering dust.\" He said he did not believe opposition to Heathrow or Stansted expansion could be overcome, and said there was \"no business case whatsover for a new hub airport. That would be a massive mistake.\" He Walsh said a new runway at Gatwick was unnecessary and airlines would not fund it through higher charges: \"I don't see any airlines have an interest in expansion. I can't see how the owners will justify the investment \u2013 I can't see EasyJet and certainly not BA funding a runway that isn't needed at Gatwick.\" Shares in IAG, which are up 57% so far this year, rose more than 6% to 315.75p.",

    "webTitle": "RBS announces Ross McEwan as Stephen Hester's successor", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A low-profile New Zealander was named as the new boss of Royal Bank of Scotland on a salary of \u00a31m a year as the bailed-out bank returned to the black by reporting \u00a31.4bn of profits. Ross McEwan, who joined RBS a year ago to run the bank's retail arm, will take over from Stephen Hester \u2013 who was parachuted in to run the bank following its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout in 2008 \u2013 on 1 October. In an attempt to avoid a furore over his pay, McEwan immediately waived his annual bonus for the rest of 2013 and for 2014. His bonuses from 2015 onwards will be linked to the share price the taxpayer paid for its 81% stake in the bank. His salary is less than the \u00a31.2m his predecessor received. Sir Philip Hampton, the RBS chairman, said the New Zealander, who has had a varied career in finance, waived his bonus as \"gesture\". However McEwan's pay package is likely to escalate. Hampton said he will be awarded a \"good commercial package\" in the future. \"Ross certainly wanted to start off life as the RBS chief executive with as little pay drama as possible,\" said Hampton. But next August, McEwan will be in line for an award of up to \u00a33m in shares under a long-term performance plan likely to run for three years. His \"commercial\" pay package will be thrashed out between now and the annual shareholder meeting next spring, when it will be put to a vote. The 56-year-old McEwan is taking charge as the government is considering whether to split the bank in two \u2013 forming good and bad banks \u2013 to make it easier to privatise in the future. His recent background in retail banking will spark speculation that he will further shrink the investment bank. The chairman, who played down speculation that he intended to quit as soon as McEwan is settled into his new role, said the government could be prevented from creating a bad bank by other RBS shareholders, who would need to approve any such move. The RBS results contained another \u00a3185m provision for mis-selling payment protection insurance, taking the bank's total bill to \u00a32.4bn. They also contain an unusual charge of \u00a3385m to cover legal costs associated with unspecified regulatory actions. This could indicate that RBS faces further fines from global regulators. In total, charges for legal action and regulatory actions stand at \u00a3620m. The first half results of RBS demonstrated how the Edinburgh-based bank's fortunes have contrasted with those of Lloyds Banking Group, where the government is expected to start selling down its stake soon. On Friday, shares in Lloyds continued to trade above 74p \u2013 which is higher than the 73.6p the taxpayer paid for its 39% stake \u2013 giving the chancellor a chance to start selling at profit. But shares in RBS were down nearly 3% at 334p, well below the average price of more than 500p at which the last government acquired its 81% stake. Hampton insisted that external candidates had not walked away from the high-profile role but he admitted that anyone who had needed buying out of a pay deal had not been considered. \"There are some bankers out there if you want to lure them away you've got to spend $20m or $30m ... We didn't spend much time discussing people who had big handcuffs attached to them,\" said Hampton. Union officials at Unite called on McEwan to end the \"slash and burn\" which has led to 30,000 job cuts since the 2008 bailout. Hester, who took over a bank in 2008 that made a record \u00a324bn loss, said: \"It really is good news that RBS is back in the black.\" The bank made its first two consecutive quarters of profit since 2008. In the same period a year ago it reported a hefty loss. Hester will now leave at the end of September and described McEwan as a \"person of integrity who has been a valued colleague over the past year\". He had hired him from Australia at a cost of \u00a33m, where had been working at Commonwealth Bank. \"I promised him an adventure and I think he will accept that an adventure is what we've delivered,\" said Hester. Any bonus McEwan might have received for 2013, while was running the RBS retail bank, will now be deferred to 2017 and then only paid out subject to conditions \"designed to allow taxpayers to gain value first\". Each year he will get \u00a3350,000 for his pension. His appointment was welcomed by the chancellor. \"He's committed to a new culture at the bank that puts the customer first, whether it's the family or small business or large company. \"I think he'll provide the leadership RBS needs as the bank puts the mistakes of the past behind it, and the government seeks to get the best value for the taxpayer from the money the last government put into the bank,\" George Osborne said.",

His bonuses from 2015 onwards will be linked to the share price the taxpayer paid for its 81% stake in the bank. His salary is less than the \u00a31.2m his predecessor received.</p> <p>Sir Philip Hampton, the RBS chairman, said the New Zealander, who has had a varied career in finance, waived his bonus as \"gesture\". However McEwan's pay package is likely to escalate. Hampton said he will be awarded a \"good commercial package\" in the future.</p> <p>\"Ross certainly wanted to start off life as the RBS chief executive with as little pay drama as possible,\" said Hampton.</p> <p>But next August, McEwan will be in line for an award of up to \u00a33m in shares under a long-term performance plan likely to run for three years. His \"commercial\" pay package will be thrashed out between now and the annual shareholder meeting next spring, when it will be put to a vote.</p> <p>The 56-year-old McEwan is taking charge as the government is considering whether to split the bank in two \u2013 forming good and bad banks \u2013 to make it easier to privatise in the future. His recent background in retail banking will spark speculation that he will further shrink the investment bank.</p> <p>The chairman, who played down speculation that he intended to quit as soon as McEwan is settled into his new role, said the government could be prevented from creating a bad bank by other RBS shareholders, who would need to approve any such move.</p> <p>The RBS results contained another \u00a3185m provision for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/aug/01/ppi-misselling-banks-which-report\" title=\"\">mis-selling payment protection insurance</a>, taking the bank's total bill to \u00a32.4bn. They also contain an unusual charge of \u00a3385m to cover legal costs associated with unspecified regulatory actions. This could indicate that RBS faces further fines from global regulators. In total, charges for legal action and regulatory actions stand at \u00a3620m.</p> <p>The first half results of RBS demonstrated how the Edinburgh-based bank's fortunes have contrasted with those of Lloyds Banking Group, where the government is expected to start selling down its stake soon.</p> <p>On Friday, shares in Lloyds continued to trade above 74p \u2013 which is higher than the 73.6p the taxpayer paid for its 39% stake \u2013 giving the chancellor a chance to start selling at profit.

Analysts said the market for new homes was showing renewed vigour after a slump following the financial crash that was deeper and longer than any other sector of the economy. The Treasury is expected to cheer the survey results, which follow a concerted effort to ease credit conditions and lower interest rates to support first time buyers. The latest Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) also signalled \" a solid increase in construction employment levels and the strongest degree of positive sentiment about future output since May 2010.\" The index jumped to 57 from 51.0 in June, where a figure above 50 indicates expansion. The Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme started last year and the chancellor's Help to Buy scheme, which kicked off earlier this year, have been cited by housebuilders as a key reason for a rise in demand for new homes. But there are still concerns in the industry that prices will race ahead of the industry's capacity to complete homes, driving up prices. Help to Buy, which underwrites the deposits of homebuyers, has proved especially controversial. Some economists have called it \"crazy\" and accused the government of attempting to create a house price feelgood factor ahead of the 2015 election. A survey by Nationwide showed average UK prices nudged up 0.8% month on month in July, with many analysts saying house price inflation could be double the CPI measure of all goods and services of 2.9% by the end of the year. Newedge Strategy said the house prices survey \"consolidates the idea that the UK housing market is gaining momentum, also supported by the BoE and government incentives to support the credit market\". The construction industry more broadly indicated that the rebound in output levels indicated during the second quarter of 2013 was maintained into July. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: \"July's survey highlights a new wave of optimism across the UK construction sector, with companies reporting a pace of expansion in excess of anything seen over the past three years. The swing back to output growth broadened to include commercial and civil engineering activity during July, although housing construction remains the one thing crucial to the sector's strong upturn at present. \"Construction firms saw the fastest improvement in new orders for over a year, which helped kick-start job creation and input buying growth during July. A switch to sharply rising purchasing activity may have caught some suppliers by surprise, as delivery times lengthened to the greatest degree in over seven years.\"",
