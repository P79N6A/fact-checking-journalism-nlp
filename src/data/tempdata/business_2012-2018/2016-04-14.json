      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s top bosses were sent a warning on Thursday that they must rein in boardroom excess when shareholders voted overwhelmingly against huge pay deals at two of Britain\u2019s biggest companies. Almost 60% of shareholders voted against a \u00a314m pay package for the chief executive of BP in a year in which it reported record losses, cut thousands of jobs and froze its employees\u2019 pay. Just hours later, more than 50% of investors voted against pay deals at the medical equipment group Smith &amp; Nephew, in a rare display of shareholders demonstrating their unwillingness to tolerate boardroom excess. After scenes recalling the 2012 \u201cshareholder spring\u201d when several major companies faced rebellions over pay, the Institute of Directors said companies must respond to shareholders\u2019 anger or risk discrediting the wider business community. \u201cBritish boards are now in the last chance saloon. If the will of shareholders in cases like this is ignored, it will only be a matter of time before the government introduces tougher regulations on executive pay,\u201d said Simon Walker, the IoD\u2019s director general. Stefan Stern, the director of the High Pay Centre, said this year\u2019s rebellions felt more substantial than the revolts of 2012. \u201cWe are reaching a point where the largest CEO packages represent a material issue for shareholders that is big enough to require serious consideration. We could be reaching a point where more shareholders will argue that it is too damaging to businesses\u2019 own interests to allow top pay to rise this high,\u201d he said. The rebellions kickstarted the annual general meeting season during which most FTSE 100 companies will hold audiences with their shareholders, big and small. Investors said company bosses would be on their guard for further standoffs. The 60% vote against the \u00a314m payout to BP\u2019s chief executive, Bob Dudley, was the second biggest rebellion of its kind at a large company, according to data compiled by the shareholder advisory group Manifest. Some 59.29% opposed the remuneration report, a rebellion that has only ever been exceeded by one at Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in 2009 at the height of the banking crisis, when 80.1% voted against, and surpassing the 59% that voted against the \u00a36.8m pay deal for Sir Martin Sorrell at his advertising company WPP in 2012. The results of the vote on BP pay were revealed by the company at its annual meeting in London and followed a barrage of criticism from shareholders who accused executives of living in a parallel universe of privilege. The huge payout in cash, shares and pension contributions to Dudley and other board members came during a year when the company ran up its largest ever losses of $6.5bn due to a collapse in oil prices and huge fines for the Deepwater Horizon accident in 2011. At the ExCel conference centre in London organisations and an army of small shareholders stepped up to lambast the board in person for rewarding themselves so inappropriately \u2013 as well as to ask why it was continuing to invest heavily in fossil fuels after promising to take climate change into account in all its operations. The Church of England pension board questioned \u201cwhether this level [of pay] is morally right\u201d and went on to ask how much one individual executive needed to be incentivised to make him work. One small shareholder, who introduced himself as Captain Hawker, said BP had stepped into a \u201cPR nightmare\u201d by handing out such largesse when the rest of the country was mired in austerity. BP\u2019s chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, told the meeting that the board would listen to shareholders\u2019 views while the chair of the company\u2019s remuneration committee promised to review its executive pay structure. \u201cLet me be clear. We hear you. We will sit down with our largest shareholders to make sure we understand their concerns and return to seek your support for a renewed policy,\u201d Svanberg said. Some 59.29 % had opposed the remuneration report, a rebellion only exceeded by one at Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) at the height of the banking crisis, and surpassing the 59% that voted against the \u00a36.8m pay deal for Sir Martin Sorrell at his advertising company WPP in 2012. Manifest compared it to other revolts including by 54% of Aviva shareholders in 2012 and by 57.1% of Royal Dutch Shell investors in 2009. Ann Dowling, the chair of BP\u2019s remuneration committee, attempted to answer the criticism and promised she would come back next year with a new formula for assessing pay. She defended the general level of pay at BP, saying it was \u201csomewhere in the middle\u201d of what other companies of a similar nature paid. \u201cWe have to reward people appropriately to attract the talented employees who are important for the future health of the company,\u201d she said. But a number of politicians and commentators including Vince Cable, the former business secretary, and Barry Sheerman, the Labour MP for Huddersfield, believed Dudley, Dowling or others should lose their jobs over the fiasco. After the meeting, Legal &amp; General\u2019s fund management arm \u2013 one of the biggest investors in the City \u2013 said it had voted against the pay deal. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, the corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management, said the board should now consider the views of shareholders. Hopes, however, were low. Roger Lawson, the deputy chairman of ShareSoc, the group of small shareholders that opposed Dudley\u2019s pay, said: \u201cIn my experience the concessions you get after a company loses a remuneration vote are not very large. They say: \u2018We\u2019ve listened to shareholders and changed this and that\u2019 and hope they can squeak it through next year.\u201d At Smith &amp; Nephew, investors were angered by a decision to allow a long-term incentive plan to pay out \u00a32.1m to 60 senior executives even though the performance criteria had not been reached. S&amp;N said: \u201cWe recognise that the use of discretion is a matter where there is considerable divergence of opinion. In spite of the voting outcome, the board unanimously believe that in these particular circumstances the remuneration committee made the right decision in aligning executive reward to the shareholder experience.\u201d",

The job cuts will fall in clerical roles at the bank, which is 73% owned by the taxpayer, including 200 posts in the London area and 400 across the north and the Midlands. The Unite union said it intended to fight any move towards compulsory redundancies by the bank, which was bailed out with \u00a345bn of taxpayer money in 2008 and 2009. \u201cWith job losses across the country and surviving branches on reduced hours, there\u2019s no doubt this latest round of cuts will hurt the bank\u2019s customers as well as our members,\u201d said Lyn Turner, Unite\u2019s regional officer. \u201cWith every branch closure Natwest is slamming its doors on another community, dangerously undermining the bank\u2019s long-term future. Unite will consult with our members as we hold the bank to its promise to avoid compulsory redundancies.\u201d The move, which mean the bank has cut more than 1,000 UK roles this year, takes place at a time when the chief executive, Ross McEwan, tries to return the bank to profit after eight successive years of losses totalling \u00a350bn. In addition to the 32 branches to be closed, the opening hours of hundreds more could be reduced. The bank, which has 1,093 NatWest branches and 206 RBS branches, said: \u201cWhere we do have to make the difficult decision to close a branch we will always tell our staff and customers first. \u201cWhere there are job cuts this is clearly difficult news for staff affected by these changes. We are doing everything we can to support them, including seeking redeployment opportunities wherever possible and ensuring that compulsory redundancies are kept to a minimum. \u201cBanking has changed significantly over the last few years and the way our customers want to interact with us is also changing. We have to continually adapt to meet our customers\u2019 needs and to ensure we remain viable and relevant both now and in the future.\u201d Banks across the UK are closing branches, blaming the need to cut costs in the face of increased use of online banking. At RBS, for instance, there has been a 43% drop in transactions at branch counters, while the bailed out bank has already been criticised for reneging on a promise not to close \u201cthe last branch in town\u201d. RBS is considering cutting opening hours by more than 30% in branches in the Midlands but could cut opening hours in hundreds of others by less than that amount. RBS may also only open branches on certain days of the week, or open later or close earlier \u2013 moves that would avoid full-scale closures. Its rival bailed-out bank, Lloyds, closed 29 branches and cut 1,775 posts earlier this year as part of the 9,000 job cuts announced by its chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, in 2014. At the time he said that a need to digitise the business would result in the closure of 200 branches. Former Barclays boss Antony Jenkins has warned that technology could lead to hundreds of job cuts and branch closures \u2013 by as much as 50% over 10 years, or 20% in a less harsh scenario. If his predictions come true, that would suggest Barclays could cut between 26,000 and 66,000 jobs worldwide, and shut between 280 and 700 branches on the high street.",

      "bodyText": "And finally (I think), here\u2019s our updated news story on today\u2019s AGM drama: Shareholders sent a warning through Britain\u2019s boardrooms at the first annual general meeting of the season by voting by a massive majority against bloated executive pay packages at BP. Almost 60% of votes cast at the meeting opposed the remuneration report. The vote is non-binding, and Dudley will still get the bumper payout, which was awarded in a year when the oil company ran up its worst ever losses of $6.5bn. It will, however, force BP to respond to its shareholders\u2019 anger. Before the vote was published, BP\u2019s chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, told the meeting that the board would listen to shareholders\u2019 views, indicating there was trouble ahead. When the votes were announced, 59.11% had opposed the remuneration report. A shaken Svanberg said the result, one of the biggest ever investor pay rebellions involving a FTSE 100 company, was advisory but accepted \u201cit does not make it any less important\u201d.... I\u2019ll pop back if there are any more developments. Otherwise, thanks for reading and commenting. GW It\u2019s been a busy day for shareholder activists, with several annual meetings taking place: Smith &amp; Nephew says it \u2018notes\u2019 that it, like BP, has suffered a shareholder revolt on pay today. Investors were angry that S&amp;N used \u2018discretion\u2019 to boost bonuses to top executives by a total of \u00a32.1m The company is defending that decision, saying it was done to align executive pay with shareholder returns. But it has also promised to rethink its pay structure: Looking ahead, as mentioned in our 2015 Annual Report, the Remuneration Committee is undertaking a thorough review of remuneration arrangements during 2016, ahead of putting a revised Remuneration Policy to shareholder vote in 2017. Over the summer, they will consult with a broad range of shareholders to solicit their views on how best to align executive reward with shareholder interests. BP has issued a statement to the City, confirming that shareholders rejected Bob Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m pay deal -- although that vote is not \u2018binding\u2019. The final voting tally shows that 59.29% of shareholders voted against the remuneration report. That makes it the second biggest pay revolt ever, after RBS (see earlier table). However, the company seems to be pressing on with the pay plans, despite shareholder anger. It is only promising to produce a \u2018revised\u2019 pay policy next year. Mr. Carl-Henric Svanberg, Chairman, says: After an outstanding operational year for the company in a very difficult oil price environment, we were pleased that we had the support of our shareholders on all the binding votes at today\u2019s meeting. We were disappointed that the advisory vote for this year\u2019s remuneration report was not carried. We have already spoken to a number of shareholders and have a continuing dialogue. They are seeking changes to our remuneration policy for the future. We will continue that engagement and will bring a revised policy to our next AGM in 2017. Revolution is in the air tonight, as a second FTSE 100 company suffers a bloody nose over its pay plans. Smith &amp; Nephew, the medical engineering company, reports that 53% of shareholders voted against its remuneration report. Here\u2019s the official statement. Chris Hughes of Bloomberg also argues that BP\u2019s remuneration committee are culpable. He writes: For starters, the remuneration committee could have applied much more discretion last year and taken Dudley\u2019s award down further. Instead, it seems to have absolved itself of responsibility by deferring too much to the shareholder-ratified pay policy. That shows poor judgement. When shareholder discontent became evident in recent weeks, BP could have taken pre-emptive action and sought to persuade Dudley to return some of the award. This was a trick deployed effectively by British banks ahead of similar AGM rows, when CEOs pre-empted show-downs by sacrificing part or all of what they had been awarded. Our City editor, Nils Pratley, argues that BP is guilty of deep corporate blindness. The remuneration committee should surely have realised that Dudley\u2019s massive pay package was unacceptable, when the oil company was also posting a whopping loss? Nils writes: Read the remuneration report and there is barely a hint of awareness that paying its chief executive, Bob Dudley, \u00a314m in a loss-making year might cause a spot of bother with the owners. Ann Dowling, the chair of the remuneration committee, concludes by saying she is pleased that BP\u2019s pay policy has \u201cappropriately recognised\u201d the company\u2019s excellent performance. Dowling\u2019s remarks only make any vague sense within BP\u2019s narrow view of how it measures its progress. Shareholders are thrown statistics of how few accidents happened last year, how many big development projects were completed on time and how much cash was generated against budget. These factors, rather than the oil price, are the things management can affect and thus should be measured against, runs the argument. As a philosophy it is internally coherent, but it is crying out for somebody to apply common sense when the pay calculator spits out a plainly ridiculous figure of \u00a314m, up 20%, for the boss in a year like the one BP has just had. The company imposed a pay freeze on staff and cut 7,000 jobs. Its share price fell 13% and it recorded a loss of $5bn (\u00a33.5bn). Here\u2019s the full piece, which concludes that Dowling should deliver an \u201chonourable resignation\u201d. David Pitt-Watson, Executive Fellow at London Business School, hopes that today\u2019s rebellion could spur more shareholders into action: \u201cThis is an interesting and unexpected result. However, rejection of pay awards which are widely regarded as unjustified should not be the exception. It should be the norm. Those who cast their vote didn\u2019t \u201cown\u201d the shares. They hold those shares on our behalf. (Almost everyone in Britain who has a funded pension will have a share in BP). And this pay award was regarded as unreasonable. Pitt-Watson suggests that advertising giant WPP could be next. It handed founder Sir Martin Sorrell a \u00a363m package this year. \u201cThe question now is whether we will see this result repeated at other companies like WPP. If so, maybe \u201cfiduciary shareholder democracy\u201d is working.That is what was intended when the shareholder vote was put in place. If not, directors\u2019 pay will remain out of control because we have no other practical way to bring it under control.\u201d Sacha Sadan, L&amp;G\u2019s director of corporate governance, has explained why his firm rejected BP\u2019s pay deal today: \u201cLGIM voted against the remuneration report as we felt there was poor alignment between long-term shareholder returns and executive remuneration. In LGIM\u2019s view the remuneration committee should have used discretion to scale back bonus payments and long term Incentive awards (LTIP) to Executive Directors during the year. \u201cWe welcome the Chairman\u2019s speech to meet leading investors and we will continue to engage with BP to develop a policy better aligned to long term shareholder returns.\u201d BP also faced criticism today over its plans to drill in the Great Australian Bight - the area to the south of mainland Australia. Environmentalists fear a repeat of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which caused huge pollution in the Gulf of Mexico. Anne-Marie Williams and Juliet Phillips of ShareAction collared BP\u2019s chairman about the project: And here\u2019s why they\u2019re so concerned: The High Pay Centre, which campaigns against excessive boardroom pay, has hailed today\u2019s vote. Here\u2019s their statement: The 59% vote against BP\u2019s remuneration report is a remarkable and welcome development. Remuneration committees have got to use what is called \u201cdiscretion\u201d, that is, do their job. The shareholders have said: you have gone too far, and this level of pay cannot be justified or accepted. The board must think again. Sky New\u2019s Mark Kleinman also suggests Professor Dame Ann Dowling may be forced off the BP board. After all, it was her remuneration committee that came up with Bob Dudley\u2019s package. Catherine Howarth, the head of the investor activist group ShareAction, attended BP\u2019s AGM. She reckons Ann Dowling, the Cambridge academic who chairs BP\u2019s pay committee, had a rough day: BP investors gasped when the initial voting figures were displayed on screens at today\u2019s AGM, at the ExCel exhibition centre in east London, Reuters reports. But it\u2019s not clear whether BP are going to heed the vote, or simply revise its pay policies for 2017. Ann Dowling, head of BP\u2019s remuneration committee (at the moment, anyway) told shareholders: \u201cWe will...review the overall remuneration package. \u201cI will report on this next year with our conclusions and with a new proposed policy based on the outcome of this review.\u201d That may not be enough to please critics, such as the Institute of Directors, who are pushing for significant reform. UK satirists are weighing in too: Vince Cable, the former business secretary, also believes BP board members must step down. The Institute of Directors has has warned BP\u2019s board not to ignore shareholders\u2019 anger over their pay policy. Simon Walker, the IoD\u2019s Director General of the IoD, says it\u2019s vital that today\u2019s vote is heeded. \u201cHow the board of BP reacts to this rebellion will determine the future of corporate governance in the UK. The shareholders have spoken, and BP cannot shrug of this significant expression of disapproval with the CEO\u2019s pay package. British boards are now in the last chance saloon, if the will of shareholders in cases like this is ignored, it will only be a matter of time before the Government introduces tougher regulations on executive pay.\u201d Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management, is urging the BP board not to ignore today\u2019s shareholder vote: \u201cWe welcome the decision by a majority of BP shareholders to vote against the remuneration package for its executive directors. We believe the vote reflects a serious discontent between the board\u2019s decision and the expectation of shareholders. \u201cThe 59.1% vote against the executive directors remuneration is extraordinary and shows a lack of discretion by BP\u2019s board. \u201cWe hope that the board now seriously considers the views of its shareholders when deciding how to proceed.\u201d Barry Sheerman, Labour MP for Huddersfield, has called for Bob Dudley to resign: The Wall Street Journal call today\u2019s vote a \u201cstinging\u201d rebuke to Bob Dudley and BP, even though the decision is \u2018non-binding\u2019 (so the board could technically ignore it). Here\u2019s their take: BP Shareholders Reject Oil Giant\u2019s Pay Policy This really is a dark day for BP; it\u2019s pretty rare for blue-chip firms to suffer this kind of humiliation at their investors\u2019 hands. More City reaction is coming in now: Business pundit Nick Hood thinks heads should roll on the BP board, for offering Dudley such a huge package and failing to heed the warning signs. Dame Ann Dowling, who chairs the remuneration committee, is one candidate. More shareholder discontent at housebuilder Persimmon. Guardian reporter Frances Perraudin was at the AGM in York and brings this report: Persimmon has been forced to defend the appointment of non-executive director Nigel Mills after questions were raised about his links to the company\u2019s financial advisers, Citi. Shareholders elected Mills, a senior adviser at Citi, to the position by a narrow margin \u2013 with 107m votes in favour, 96m votes against and 730,000 votes withheld \u2013 despite investor bodies raising concerns that he would not be independent. Speaking at the company\u2019s AGM at York racecourse on Thursday, Nicholas Wrigley, the chair of the company\u2019s board, said they had considered the issue very carefully and that they were \u201ctotally convinced\u201d that Mills was the right person for the role. \u201cWe respect shareholders opinions but we believe Nigel is independent and his appointment is line with the provisions of the UK corporate governance code,\u201d he said. US markets are roughly flat in early trading : Dow Jones: -0.07% at 17,895.65 S&amp;P 500: -0.03% at 2,081.87 Nasdaq: -0.2% at 4,937.06 It looks as though the BP vote could be the second biggest shareholder rebellion. Other notable revolts in the past are listed below. Votes against pay at FTSE 100 companies RBS: 80.1% WPP: 59.07% Royal Dutch Shell: 57.1% Xstrata: 55% Burberry: 52.3% Intertek: 51.2% Source: Manifest Institutional investor L&amp;G says it was among shareholders voting against BP pay: Guardian reporter Sean Farrell has been speaking to Roger Lawson of ShareSoc, the small shareholder\u2019s group, about BP. Lawson points out that the big vote against Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m package does not necessarily mean BP will radically alter it. They need to totally review Mr Dudley\u2019s remuneration package, rebase it and redesign the bonus and LTIP arrangements. That\u2019s the only real solution. They can try to get away with fiddling with it but it depends how forceful the institutional investors they talk to are. In my experience the concessions you get after a company loses a remuneration vote are not very large. They say: \u2018We\u2019ve listened to shareholders and changed this and that\u2019 and hope they can squeak it through next year. We will be bringing you more reaction to the incredible shareholder revolt at BP as it comes in. In the meantime, proof if proof were needed that vinyl records are still loved... Sales have reached their highest level for 20 years and could be on track to return to their peak levels in the 1980s, an industry body said. Figures produced by the BPI showed sales grew 60% between January and March, compared with a year earlier. Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI, said: Vinyl is no longer the preserve of baby-boomers who grew up with the format. It now also appeals to a new generation of engaged younger fans and millennials. Read our full story on the BP shareholder revolt here. The Guardian\u2019s Energy editor Terry Macalister is at the AGM and has described the vote as \u201castonishing\u201d... BREAKING: 59.1% of BP shareholders vote against Bob Dudley\u2019s 2015 pay. Over in the US, new jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week, revisiting a level last seen in 1973 when Richard Nixon was President and Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips had a number one hit with Midnight Train to Georgia... Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell by 13,000 to 253,000 in the week ended 9 April. Economists had forecast a rise to 270,000. It matched the level recorded for early March, which was the lowest since November 1973. It is the latest sign that the US labour market is improving despite a sluggish economy. Shareholders at BP\u2019s tense AGM are asking why lower oil prices are not exerting downward pressure on executive pay at the company... BP\u2019s chairman has told shareholders at the oil company\u2019s AGM it will respond to concerns about the near-\u00a314m pay package awarded to chief executive Bob Dudley. Here\u2019s our full story. Svanberg told the AGM: Later in the meeting we will discuss and vote on the resolution on the director\u2019s demuneration Report. That vote is advisory. We know already from the proxies received and conversations with our institutional investors that there is real concern over the directors\u2019 pay in this challenging year for our shareholders. He said all investors recognised Bob Dudley\u2019s achievements in improving BP\u2019s operations. But he added: On remuneration, the shareholders\u2019 reactions are very strong. They are seeking change in the way we should approach this in the future. Let me be clear. We hear you. We will sit down with our largest shareholders to make sure we understand their concerns and return to seek your support for a renewed policy. It looks like Persimmon could also face some difficult questions at its AGM... The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) argues that the bonus given to BP\u2019s chief executive Bob Dudley is justified \u2013 saying that his decision making will contribute to the company\u2019s long term success. Peter Simons of CIMA says: Campaigners against ultra-high executive pay frequently have valid perspectives \u2013 and our own research shows that 61% of bosses admit their organisation\u2019s incentive structures aren\u2019t encouraging the right sort of decisions. But in my opinion this example is different. Much of Bob Dudley\u2019s proposed bonus relates to progress against major change objectives to ensure BP\u2019s long term success. This is the right way to use bonuses, to encourage sustainable business, not just reward short term performance. So, while investors and analysts are right to be wary of any bonus with lots of zeroes - we\u2019d suggest that incentives are more important in the bad times than they are in the good. Mining giant Rio Tinto is also holding its annual meeting in London today, the last AGM for chief executive Sam Walsh. The company will hold another AGM in Brisbane on 5 May. Rio Tinto has posted a speech by John Varley, the former Barclays boss who chairs the miner\u2019s remuneration committee, on its website. He says about executive pay, always a sensitive issue \u2013 Of course, we recognise that strong feelings exist about executive pay. We also know that there will never be a perfect consensus among our owners on this subject. For this reason the remuneration committee seeks to maintain its constructive dialogue with our shareholders and we will continue these conversations in the months ahead. You can read the speech here (pdf). The text of the opening speech by chairman Jan du Plessis can be found here. The AGM season is getting under way. BP\u2019s chief executive Bob Dudley is facing shareholders in London amid anger over his \u00a313.8m pay package, while housebuilder Persimmon is holding its AGM at the racecourse in York. The builder could face questions over its generous share bonus scheme, approved in 2012, and the composition of its boardroom. The share plan could hand an estimated \u00a3600m to 150 directors by 2022/ As far as BP goes, the Institute of Directors made a rare intervention on executive pay ahead of the AGM, urging BP shareholders to think twice before backing Dudley\u2019s pay award. Here is our full story on the Bank of England decision. Katie Allen writes: A vote to leave the EU could harm economic growth and have a serious impact on the pound and other UK assets, the Bank of England said on Thursday, as it took steps to prepare for June\u2019s referendum. Minutes to the Bank\u2019s latest policy meeting showed its nine-strong monetary policy committee voted unanimously to leave interest rates at their historic low of 0.5%. The committee said uncertainty ahead of what is expected to be a close EU vote appeared to be weighing on investment decisions and policymakers said economic growth could slow as a result in the second quarter of the year. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says: The committee reiterated its judgment that \u201cit is more likely than not that Bank Rate will need to increase over the forecast period\u201d in order to keep inflation in check. It therefore clearly disagrees with the markets\u2019 view that interest rates are more likely to fall than to rise this year and will not reach 0.75% until 2020. All in all, the committee still is in \u2018wait and see\u2019 mode; it will take stock after the EU referendum has been concluded in June, likely with a vote to remain. We continue to think that inflation will surprise to the upside later this year and throughout 2017, compelling the MPC to raise interest rates at least once before the end of this year. Here\u2019s Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, on the Bank of England decision: Consumer spending, aided by low inflation, low unemployment and rising wages, has been the engine of economic growth lately. But recent surveys suggest consumers reined in their spending in March - perhaps the first sign of nerves ahead of June\u2019s EU referendum. Today\u2019s minutes from the Bank of England note that uncertainty over the referendum has begun to affect the real economy. The BoE also admits that UK economic data will be hard to assess until the June referendum is over. Bank of England policymakers have also warned that uncertainty over the European Union referendum is hitting economic growth. The Monetary Policy Committee say that uncertainty relating to the EU referendum has begun to weigh on certain areas of activity. The minutes of this month\u2019s meeting state that: Some decisions, including on capital expenditure and commercial property transactions, are being postponed pending the outcome of the vote. This might lead to some softening in growth during the first half of 2016. The Bank has also warned that Britain could be plunged into a long period of uncertainty if the public vote to leave the EU in June. The pound could be hit hard, they say: The Committee considered the likely implications for monetary policy of a vote to leave the European Union. Such a vote might result in an extended period of uncertainty about the economic outlook, including about the prospects for export growth. This uncertainty would be likely to push down on demand in the short run. Uncertainty regarding the supply side of the economy might also increase, reflecting any alterations to product or labour market regulation, adjustments in labour flows or changes in the rate of technology adoption as a result of different arrangements governing foreign trade and capital flows. A vote to leave could have significant implications for asset prices, in particular the exchange rate. And the Committee also hints that it could be forced to cut interest rates to fresh record lows, to fight off the threat of deflation: Ultimately, monetary policy would be set in order to meet the inflation target, while also ensuring that inflation expectations remained anchored. Whatever the outcome of the referendum, the MPC would use its tools to achieve its inflation remit. The Bank of England says there has been \u201cmixed news\u201d on the prospects for global growth in the near term. The minutes of this month\u2019s MPC meeting state that: Immediate downside risks around Chinese activity have lessened; in the United States, indicators of GDP growth in the first quarter of the year have been disappointing, but those for the second quarter are more encouraging. Movements in the prices of risky assets suggest that investors have regained their risk appetite, possibly reflecting more positive global economic data and policy action by central banks. Nevertheless, given weak supply growth, the Committee continues to expect global growth to be somewhat subdued by historical standards. UK interest rates have now been hold for 85 months running, going all the way back to March 2009. There are children at school who weren\u2019t even born when borrowing costs were last above 0.5%. Breaking: The Bank of England has voted 9-0 to leave interest rates unchanged, at 0.5%. That\u2019s largely as expected, despite some chatter that one policymaker might be tempted to vote for a cut. In all honesty, this isn\u2019t the most eagerly anticipated central bank decision in history: Burberry\u2019s sales woes have dampened the mood in the City this morning. Shares in the luxury retailer are still down 7%, as investors react to the 5% fall in like-for-like sales in the last quarter. Mining shares are also down, following a rise in the US dollar against the pound today (which pushes down commodity prices) The wider FTSE 100 is currently down 3 points, seemingly becalmed ahead of the Bank of England rate decision at noon. Other markets are equally dull, with Germany\u2019s DAX up 0.05% and France\u2019s CAC down 0.1%. Joshua Mahoney of IG sums up the mood: These Bank of England meetings have turned from a monthly must-see to a somewhat mundane ritual, given the clear remoteness of any near-term monetary policy shift. One thing that has changed is inflation is finally starting to pick up. Thus, any shift in tone from the committee will be closely tracked as a cue to draw forward rate hike expectations. Burberry shares tumbled heavily at the release of a lacklustre set of earnings today, with the company representing the second luxury retailer this week to be hit by falling footfall in Europe. Interestingly, Burberry sales in China continue to grow, providing the latest sign that despite the economic slowdown, consumption is on the rise in the Chinese middle class. Having said that....Jeremy Cook of World First predicts that the Bank of England will vote 9-0 to leave interest rates unchanged at today\u2019s meeting. Which Bank policymakers could be tempted to vote to cut interest rates? Chief economist Andy Haldane is one candidate. Twice last year, he suggested that borrowing costs could be cut from the current 0.5%, if economic conditions worsened. Another option is Gertjan Vlieghe, the hedge fund economist who joined the MPC last summer. in January, he warned of \u201cthe possibility that real interest rates will remain well below their historical average for a very long time\u201d. We have one hour to wait until the Bank of England releases its interest rate decision. Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway suggests that some Bank policymakers are close to voting to cut interest rates. Greece\u2019s economic plight has claimed another victim - electronics chain Elektroniki Athinon. The company is shutting its 45 stores, after declaring bankruptcy. The Kathimerini newspaper reports: In a statement released on Wednesday, the company cited the state of the local economy, the weakening of Greek consumers\u2019 purchasing power, the imposition of capital controls last year and a suspension of a restructuring plan among the reasons behind its insolvency. According to Elektroniki, the company\u2019s 450 employees were not owed unpaid wages, while compensation would be paid in about 8 months. A glimmer of good news from Europe -- the eurozone is no longer in deflation. New data from Eurostat show that consumer prices were unchanged across the region last month, rather than falling by 0.1% as first estimated. However, plenty of countries are still experiencing deflation, despite the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus efforts: Speaking of Royal Bank of Scotland.... More than seven years after the financial crisis, Britain\u2019s government should accept that it may never make a profit on its shareholding on Royal Bank of Scotland. That\u2019s the view of the top civil servant at Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury, Sir Nick Macpherson, a man who has played a key role behind the scenes for decades. Macpherson, who is stepping down from the Treasury, told the Financial Times that it will be \u201ctricky\u201d for the state to sell all of its \u00a319.2bn stake in RBS before the next election. \u201cMy one experience of running banks is that the longer they stay in the public sector, the greater the likelihood that you will lose value.\u201d So a judgement must be made on whether to bite the bullet, and sell at a loss, Macpherson believes. RBS\u2019s shares are changing hands at just 227p today, compared to the \u2018break-even\u2019 price of around 502p which the taxpayer paid in 2008 and 2009. So it\u2019s hard to argue with Macpherson\u2019s logic \u2013 given chancellor George Osborne\u2019s desire to wash his hands of RBS. Swallowing a multi-billion pound loss will also be problematic, even though the bailout did prevent the collapse of Britain\u2019s banks. JD Sports has smashed City expectations, sending its shares up 2%. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: JD Sports has reported a 45% surge in annual profits and booming sales in sports fashion as it rolls out stores across Europe. Strong demand for trainers made by Nike and other leading brands, as well as for women\u2019s sportswear, meant that like-for-like sales at JD\u2019s sports fashion division rose by more than 10% for the second year running.... More here: There may be tears before bedtime at Mothercare. Shares in the parent and baby chain have slumped by 15% this morning, to the lowest level since October 2014. In its latest results, Mothercare reported that international sales have slumped by around 10%, due to turmoil overseas: It says: International continues to be affected by ongoing economic and currency headwinds. Retail sales in constant currency were down (9.7%) with currency further impacting retail sales in actual currency which were down (10.8%). Sales fell in all four international regions - the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Latin America. It says: In the Middle East consumer sentiment was impacted by the sustained lower oil price, resulting in a significant decline in constant currency sales. In Asia, China in particular, was affected by weakening consumer confidence. Europe and Latin America were impacted by adverse currency moves. That took the shine off a 2.1% rise in UK sales, as the company\u2019s turnaround plan gathers pace, and triggered something of a tantrum in the City: Unilever hasn\u2019t impressed the City either, despite reporting underlying sales growth of 4.7% and hiking its dividend. Shares in the consumer giant are down almost 1% in early trading, after it warned that markets remaining volatile. The company behind Lynx deodorant, Persil soap powder and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s icecream is experiencing \u201cchallenging macro-economic conditions\u201d in the Americas. And in Europe, sales growth was more than wiped out by price deflation. Financial officer Graeme Pitkethly summed it up to Reuters: \u201cWe expected tougher markets and we\u2019re finding tougher markets.\u201d Shares in Burberry have slumped by 6% at the start of trading, after it hit investors with more bad news. Burberry reported that like-for-like sales have fallen by 5% in the last quarter. And it also warned that profits for the current financial year are likely to only reach the bottom of analyst expectations. The luxury fashion chain blamed weaker tourist spending in Europe, following recent terrorist attacks. It is also suffering from tough trading conditions in China and Hong Kong, which is a key area for the company. A swathe of emerging market currencies have slumped today, after Singapore surprised investors by announcing it won\u2019t allow its currency to strengthen. Bloomberg has the details: Singapore\u2019s dollar slumped the most since August, dragging down other Asia-Pacific currencies, as surprise easing by the central bank fueled speculation other policy makers in the region will follow suit. New Zealand\u2019s dollar, Malaysia\u2019s ringgit and Indonesia\u2019s rupiah also weakened after the Monetary Authority of Singapore said it would seek a policy of zero appreciation against an undisclosed basket of currencies, returning to a neutral stance it adopted in the global financial crisis in 2008. Singapore\u2019s central bank cited \u201ca less favorable external environment\u201d in its policy statement, adding to concern the outlook for global growth is worsening. More here: Singapore Surprise Policy Easing Spurs Asia-Wide Currency Rout Asian stock markets have posted solid gains today, picking up the baton after yesterday\u2019s strong performance in Europe and the US. Japan\u2019s Nikkei surged by over 3%, while the Australian S&amp;P/ASX rose by 1.2% and the South Koreas\u2019 market gained 2%. This sent markets across the region to their highest level since late November, as Reuters explains: MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5%, reaching its highest level since Nov. 26. It has risen 5 percent since Friday, breakingabove several resistance levels to signal further gains. The rally was partly driven by optimism over global economic prospects, after China posted better-than-expected export figures yesterday. It was also triggered by the surprise news that Singapore\u2019s central bank has eased monetary policy overnight. It will not allow the Singapore dollar to appreciate against other currencies. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Bank of England interest rate decision day! At noon BST, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee will announce whether it has left borrowing costs at the record low of just 0.5%, and whether it has altered its quantitative easing stimulus programme. Economists don\u2019t expect any changes, even though inflation has just risen to a 15-month high of 0.5%. But the minutes of this month\u2019s meeting will show how concerned the Bank is about financial conditions, and the upcoming UK referendum in just over two months. Meanwhile, the earnings season will get into full swing this morning, with results from consumer giant Unilever and Nestle, fashion chain Burberry, UK high street retailers Debenhams and JD Sports, and housebuilder Persimmon. Wall Street\u2019s Bank of America and Wells Fargo are releasing their results later today too. European stock markets are expected to open positively, extending yesterday\u2019s rally which sent the FTSE 100 to its highest level of the year. And oil giant BP is holding its AGM in London, where CEO Bob Dudley will face criticism over his $20m pay package. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Shareholders are thrown statistics of how few accidents happened last year, how many big development projects were completed on time and how much cash was generated against budget. These factors, rather than the oil price, are the things management can affect and thus should be measured against, runs the argument.</p> <p>As a philosophy it is internally coherent, but it is crying out for somebody to apply common sense when the pay calculator spits out a plainly ridiculous figure of \u00a314m, up 20%, for the boss in a year like the one <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bp\">BP</a> has just had.

      "bodyText": "My story mirrors that of Tony (How Boots went rogue, The long read, 13 April). I have been broken by Boots despite being loyal. I too have had overwhelming pressure to perform services for pure profit over patient benefit. I was set targets by my manager at times expecting 30 Medicines Use Reviews (MURs) a week. My manager showed total disregard for ethics, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t care how you do them but I want them done.\u201d For a period in this store I refused to do services as I felt patient safety issues in store needed to be addressed first or a patient would come to harm. These concerns were on more than one occasion dismissed and I was threatened that if I didn\u2019t do the services I would face disciplinary action. The manager on a daily basis would assign me to the walk-in counter in an extremely busy store with trainee staff producing a high error rate. Scripts were never ready and done on a walk-in basis despite them being in store for up to a week. Towards the end of my time in that store I had no dispenser and was facing queues and complaints on my own despite asking for help and was self-checking. The pressure was extreme and bad practices led me to take time off for stress. My health and confidence have been affected and in my experience Boots has put MURs and NMS before basic patient care. Self-checking is expected and relied upon substantially and the common practice in most stores open on a Sunday is for a pharmacist to work without a dispenser. I have experienced fear, disciplinary threats and pressure to go beyond patient care and return a profit. They are a force unto themselves. Name and address supplied \u2022 I have an elderly mother requiring a lot of routine repeat medication on prescription from her GP in north-west England. She does not pay a prescription charge, but the NHS supplies the medication. It appals me that when she hands in her list of repeat drugs to Boots, with the items she needs ticked off, the pharmacist ignores the ticks and issues the whole lot. She does not require the eye drops each month, or the paracetamol, so she does not tick these items. Yet I find a stockpile of them in her kitchen cabinet rapidly nearing or past their use-by date. When I return them to the store I am told that they have been issued and so cannot be given to anybody else. Our NHS is paid for by all of us, we should all play our part to ensure that medication is not wasted. Lesley Foote Brentford, Middlesex \u2022 I have been a practising community pharmacist for 15 years. During my time I have seen the pressure build up. It has now reached an unsustainable level and many are leaving the profession as a result. More and more of those in charge of running the healthcare services are non-pharmacist managers with little idea of what they are managing. They seem to only understand figures and targets. Anything else bypasses them, which ultimately creates a vicious cycle of lower patient care due to lack of support and trained staff. My experience has been such that the pharmacist must make a stand on a regular basis to be heard. This creates an unnecessary distraction which shouldn\u2019t be allowed to exist if the managers were doing their job properly. Name and address supplied \u2022 I left Boots back in 1997 to work in supermarket pharmacy for 15 years. I have been a self-employed locum since 2012. I would like to think I have always put the needs of the patient first but pressure to perform and hit targets is everywhere. At least I now have control over where I work. I think it is telling that I will not be encouraging either of my children into the profession. After completing a four-year degree then another year completing pre-registration, it seems they would be better off training and qualifying as a plumber or electrician. Jayne Gleed Hamble, Hampshire \u2022 Pharmacists undergo five years of training to become medicines experts. They are trained to develop clinical relationships with patients, but are thwarted from doing so by the preference of many retail-oriented non-pharmacist employers intent on them merely supplying products and commoditised services measured only by quantitative targets. MURs are sadly treated this way. The employer benefits from the MUR fee, not the pharmacist, and in many organisations demands have engendered a culture that pressurises and sometimes bullies pharmacists to deliver. Your article describes pharmacists being demoralised by the erosion of their professional autonomy, and finding themselves working with staffing levels that border on dangerous at times. Today\u2019s community pharmacy service is therefore a mere shadow of its true potential. My union has calculated that the money available to \u201cchain\u201d pharmacies in MUR fees would fund a cohort of about 2,000 pharmacists who could contract directly with the NHS and concentrate on delivering a clinical rather than transactional pharmaceutical care service to patients who would benefit the most. These services could be provided in patients\u2019 homes, care homes, GP surgeries and in consultation rooms of existing community pharmacies. This would provide patients with a more focused service, the NHS better value for money and make better use of pharmacists\u2019 unique skills. It would also allow hard-pressed community pharmacists to concentrate on delivering excellence in the wide range of services that they are renowned for providing, making them more accessible as the source of expert advice on medicines. John Murphy General secretary, the Pharmacists\u2019 Defence Association Union \u2022 The alleged abuse by Boots of NHS payments for MURs illustrates that a simplistic approach to resourcing care can be counterproductive where commercial imperatives are more powerful than professional conscience. In contrast, financial incentives for GPs have been effective in enhancing care of chronic illness. Despite its shortcomings, the overwhelming majority of GPs have engaged in the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) responsibly and professionally. I suggest that this is partly because the professionals and the business leads in general practice are one and the same, and wealth-seeking behaviour is tempered by their professionalism as doctors. Furthermore, the QOF scheme was carefully designed and constantly fine-tuned by collaborative negotiation between general practice and the Department of Health to ensure both effectiveness and value. In Boots\u2019 case, however, there is a disconnect between business managers, who see the scheme merely as commercial opportunity, and their pharmacist employees, whose professionalism comes under huge pressure to play their employers\u2019 game to maximise profit. Having worked with pharmacists for years as a GP and a researcher, I know that in the right environment and with appropriate skills, pharmacists can transform the quality and safety of prescribing and medicines management. Perverse incentives such as in the current MUR scheme only serve to undermine the professionalism of pharmacists and in their present form contribute little to care. The scheme should not be abandoned, but should be restructured to promote quality and safety.

I have been broken by Boots despite being loyal. I&#xa0;too have had overwhelming pressure to perform services for pure profit over patient benefit. I was set targets by my manager at times expecting 30 Medicines Use Reviews (MURs) a week. My manager showed total disregard for ethics, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t care how you do them but I want them done.\u201d For a period in this store I&#xa0;refused to do services as I felt patient safety issues in store needed to be addressed first or a patient would come to harm. These concerns were on more than one occasion dismissed and I was threatened that if I didn\u2019t do the services I would face disciplinary action. The manager on a daily basis would assign me to the walk-in counter in an extremely busy store with trainee staff producing a high error rate. Scripts were never ready and done on a walk-in basis despite them being in store for up to a week. Towards the end of my time in that store I had no dispenser and was facing queues and complaints on my own despite asking for help and was self-checking. The pressure was extreme and bad practices led me to take time off for stress.</p> <p>My health and confidence have been affected and in my experience Boots has put MURs and NMS before basic patient care. Self-checking is expected and relied upon substantially and the common practice in most stores open on a Sunday is for a pharmacist to work without a dispenser.</p> <p>I have experienced fear, disciplinary threats and pressure to go beyond patient care and return a profit. They are a force unto themselves.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>\u2022 I have an elderly mother requiring a lot of routine repeat medication on prescription from her GP in north-west England. She does not pay a prescription charge, but the NHS supplies the medication. It&#xa0;appals me that when she hands in her list of repeat drugs to Boots, with the items she needs ticked off, the pharmacist ignores the ticks and issues the whole lot. She does not require the eye drops each month, or the paracetamol, so she does not tick these items. Yet I find a stockpile of them in her kitchen cabinet rapidly nearing or past their use-by date. When I return them to the store I am told that they have been issued and so cannot be given to anybody else.</p> <p>Our NHS is paid for by all of us, we should all play our part to ensure that medication is not wasted.<br><strong>Lesley Foote</strong><br><em>Brentford, Middlesex</em></p> <p>\u2022 I have been a practising community pharmacist for 15 years. During my time I have seen the pressure build up. It has now reached an unsustainable level and many are leaving the profession as a result.</p> <p>More and more of those in charge of running the healthcare services are non-pharmacist managers with little idea of what they are managing. They seem to only understand figures and targets. Anything else bypasses them, which ultimately creates a vicious cycle of lower patient care due to lack of support and trained staff.</p> <p>My experience has been such that the pharmacist must make a stand on a regular basis to be heard. This creates an unnecessary distraction which shouldn\u2019t be allowed to exist if the managers were doing their job properly.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>\u2022 I left Boots back in 1997 to work in supermarket pharmacy for 15 years. I have been a self-employed locum since 2012. I&#xa0;would like to think I have always put the needs of the patient first but pressure to perform and hit targets is everywhere. At least I now have control over where I&#xa0;work. I think it is telling that I will not be encouraging either of&#xa0;my children into the profession. After completing a four-year degree then another year completing pre-registration, it seems they would be better off training and qualifying as a plumber or electrician.<br><strong>Jayne Gleed</strong><br><em>Hamble, Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Pharmacists undergo five years of training to become medicines experts. They are trained to develop clinical relationships with patients, but are thwarted from doing so by the preference of many retail-oriented non-pharmacist employers intent on them merely supplying products and commoditised services measured only by quantitative targets. MURs are sadly treated this way.</p> <p>The employer benefits from the MUR fee, not the pharmacist, and in many organisations demands have engendered a culture that pressurises and sometimes bullies pharmacists to deliver.</p> <p>Your article describes pharmacists being demoralised by the erosion of their professional autonomy, and finding themselves working with staffing levels that border on dangerous at times.</p> <p>Today\u2019s community pharmacy service is therefore a mere shadow of its true potential. My union has calculated that the money available to \u201cchain\u201d pharmacies in MUR fees would fund a cohort of about 2,000 pharmacists who could contract directly with the NHS and concentrate on delivering a clinical rather than transactional pharmaceutical care service to patients who would benefit the most. These services could be provided in patients\u2019 homes, care homes, GP surgeries and in consultation rooms of existing community pharmacies.</p> <p>This would provide patients with a more focused service, the NHS better value for money and make better use of pharmacists\u2019 unique skills. It would also allow hard-pressed community pharmacists to concentrate on delivering excellence in the wide range of services that they are renowned for providing, making them more accessible as the source of expert advice on medicines.<br><strong>John Murphy</strong><br><em>General secretary, the Pharmacists\u2019 Defence Association Union</em></p> <p>\u2022 The alleged abuse by Boots of NHS payments for MURs illustrates that a simplistic approach to resourcing care can be counterproductive where commercial imperatives are more powerful than professional conscience. In contrast, financial incentives for GPs have been effective in enhancing care of chronic illness. Despite its shortcomings, the overwhelming majority of GPs have engaged in the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) responsibly and professionally. I suggest that this is partly because the professionals and the business leads in general practice are one and the same, and wealth-seeking behaviour is tempered by their professionalism as doctors. Furthermore, the QOF scheme was carefully designed and constantly fine-tuned by collaborative negotiation between general practice and the Department of Health to ensure both effectiveness and value.</p> <p>In Boots\u2019 case, however, there is a disconnect between business managers, who see the scheme merely as commercial opportunity, and their pharmacist employees, whose professionalism comes under huge pressure to play their employers\u2019 game to maximise profit.</p> <p>Having worked with pharmacists for years as a GP and a researcher, I know that in the right environment and with appropriate skills, pharmacists can transform the quality and safety of prescribing and medicines management. Perverse incentives such as in the current MUR scheme only serve to undermine the professionalism of pharmacists and in their present form contribute little to care. The scheme should not be abandoned, but should be restructured to promote quality and safety. <br><strong>Dr Arnold Zermansky</strong><br><em>Portfolio GP and visiting senior research fellow, Leeds </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The managing director of the International Monetary Fund has made an impassioned plea for Britain to stay in the EU, saying Brexit would spell the painful breakdown of a \u201clong marriage\u201d with grave risks for the global economy. Christine Lagarde said uncertainty created by the 23 June referendum was already dragging down the UK economy, and a decision to leave the bloc would make matters worse. She said that if the UK did leave the EU it would spark debate in other member countries about whether they should follow its example, which would create even more uncertainty and risk. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long marriage between members of the European Union. It\u2019s my personal hope that it doesn\u2019t break. And like all marriages, good talks can actually help,\u201d she said at the IMF and World Bank\u2019s spring meetings in Washington. She urged politicians to \u201crise above the domestic circle\u201d, and said she personally leaned towards the UK and the EU \u201cstaying together and working it out\u201d. Lagarde, who has already called for the UK to remain part of the EU, drew on the 28-nation bloc\u2019s history to call for continued unity. \u201cKeeping Europe together after what it has gone through is a huge asset that has been vastly under-estimated.\u201d She reiterated a warning the IMF made earlier this week on the potential blow to economic growth and financial stability across Europe and beyond from a Brexit vote. \u201cThe risk of exit of the United Kingdom is a serious concern,\u201d she said. In its update on the global economic outlook the IMF downgraded its expectations of UK growth this year from 2.2% to 1.9%, a significant drop from 2.2% achieved in 2015. The warning was welcomed by campaigners for the UK to stay in the EU, including David Cameron, but Brexit campaigners accused the international institution of talking Britain down. Speaking at the spring meetings, which are attended by central bankers and finance ministers from 189 countries, Lagarde said: \u201cWe have clearly elevated Brexit as more of a serious downside risk to our forecast for global growth.\u201d Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, also said that Britain would be stronger by remaining part of the EU. \u201cThe Brexit is an issue for the British voters and we leave it to the British voters to decide,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] this is an economy that is not going to do well with more uncertainty.\u201d The warnings about Brexit in Washington chimed with comments from the Bank of England that the referendum was generating uncertainty and could weigh on economic growth in coming months. A vote to leave the EU could harm economic growth and have a serious impact on the pound and other UK assets, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) said in minutes to its latest interest rate meeting. In its strongest statement yet on the June referendum, the Bank revealed its rate-setters had been weighing up possible responses to a Brexit vote. Many economists believe such an outcome would prompt the Bank to cut interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis, according to a Reuters poll this week. Ahead of what is expected to be a tight poll, there were signs that companies were delaying investment decisions and the pound had weakened markedly, policymakers noted as they left interest rates at a record low of 0.5%. Borrowing costs have been at their historic low for seven years and the tone of the minutes underscored expectations they would remain there until well into next year. The Bank vowed to tread carefully ahead of the vote and in the aftermath of a potential Brexit. The record of the meeting said: \u201cSuch a vote might result in an extended period of uncertainty about the economic outlook, including about the prospects for export growth. This uncertainty would be likely to push down on demand in the short run \u2026 A vote to leave could have significant implications for asset prices, in particular the exchange rate. \u201cThe MPC would have to make careful judgements about the next effects of these potential influences on demand, supply and inflation. Ultimately, monetary policy would be set in order to meet the inflation target, while also ensuring that inflation expectations remained anchored.\u201d The referendum got 17 mentions in the latest minutes compared with five after March\u2019s policy meeting, noted James Knightley, and economist at ING bank. He said the Bank of England was clearly in wait-and-see mode on policy given the pressure on consumer sentiment, business confidence and investment ahead of the vote. \u201cHowever, should the UK vote to leave the next move is likely to be a rate cut as policymakers try to shore up confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect sterling to fall sharply, which would push up inflation temporarily, but the expected hit to economic activity in an environment where business and consumer sentiment is severely strained suggests that the BoE will look through this.\u201d",

Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, said the revelations that many of the world\u2019s richest and most powerful people are avoiding paying millions in taxes by hiding money from the taxman in offshore havens is a \u201cgreat, great concern\u201d and \u201cvery, very damaging\u201d to the bank\u2019s \u201cmission to end extreme poverty\u201d. \u201cWhen taxes are evaded, when state assets are taken and put into these havens, all of these things can have a tremendous negative effect on our mission to end poverty and boost prosperity,\u201d Kim said as he opened the Spring Meetings of the World Bank and IMF in Washington. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the IMF, said the Panama Papers, an unprecedented leak of 11.5m files from offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca, showed that \u201cthe [international tax] rules appear to be skewed towards\u201d the global rich. \u201cClearly what has resulted from the review of these Panama Papers indicates that however important [international tax rules to prevent] base erosion and profit shifting \u2026 it is unfinished business,\u201d she said in an opening address to the meeting. Lagarde said more global cooperation is needed to stop tax avoidance and to ensure \u201cthe net does not have little loopholes here and there\u201d. \u201cA lot of things have gone global but there is one thing that has not gone global and that is tax. It is still very much a local affair,\u201d she said. \u201cInternational cooperation really has to be significantly improved and we are happy to play our part.\u201d \u201cWhen we issue a report that is flabbergasting, indicating that work needs to be done by the country there has to be follow-up.\u201d Kim said he and Lagarde are \u201cworking as aggressively as we can\u201d to track down tax evaders, and warned anyone thinking about avoiding tax to be \u201cvery careful\u201d. \u201cWhen former government officials leave a country and take stolen funds with them we have to track them down,\u201d he said. Kim said he had been to many countries where the only ones who pay tax are those \u201ctoo weak to refuse\u201d. \u201cYou see systems where the rich don\u2019t pay and the poor do. There is a comprehensive problem that we have to tackle.\u201d \u201cTransparency is not going to move backward,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is only going to become more and more transparent as we move forward. \u201cBe very careful and also understand that leaders in developing countries all over the world are telling us that they want to work with us very strongly to track down these illicit flows to make sure the fair share of taxes are being paid. To make sure much of these assets that are taken literally out of the hands of governments and the poor can be reutilised for tackling poverty and inequality.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "BP\u2019s board didn\u2019t see it coming. The oil company was braced for 20%, maybe 25%, of shareholders to vote against its pay report. But 59% was a drubbing. It is the second-biggest protest over pay at a FTSE 100 company. That inglorious league table, incidentally, is headed by Royal Bank of Scotland, in the days when the government had to be seen to rebel against Fred Goodwin\u2019s egregious pension arrangements. BP\u2019s corporate blindness goes deep. Read the remuneration report and there is barely a hint of awareness that paying the chief executive, Bob Dudley, \u00a314m in a loss-making year might cause a spot of bother with the owners. Prof Dame Ann Dowling, chair of the remuneration committee, concludes by saying she is \u201cpleased\u201d that BP\u2019s pay policy has \u201cappropriately recognised\u201d the company\u2019s excellent performance. Dowling\u2019s remarks only make any vague sense within BP\u2019s narrow view of how it measures its progress. Shareholders are thrown statistics of how few accidents happened last year, how many big development projects were completed on time, and how much cash was generated against budget. These factors \u2013 rather than the oil price \u2013 are the things management can affect and thus are useful yardsticks for pay, runs the argument. As a philosophy, it is internally coherent. But it is crying out for somebody to apply common sense when the pay calculator spits out a plainly ridiculous figure of \u00a314m, up 20%, for the boss in a year such as the one BP has just had. The company imposed a pay freeze on staff and cut 7,000 jobs; its share price fell 13% and it recorded a loss of $5bn. Yes, as BP would point out, the financial score was hit by charges from the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. But, even ignoring those costs, BP\u2019s profits plunged 50%. And you really think it was pleasing and appropriate that Dudley should receive \u00a31m a month? He has a tricky job but that rate of reward just looks greedy. Dowling\u2019s response to the 59% vote was to play a dead bat. \u201cShareholder criticism raises some fundamental questions around our policy and we will consider those in the coming months,\u201d she said. Put like that, it almost sounds like a technical problem that a highly regarded mechanical engineer \u2013 she is president of the Royal Academy of Engineering \u2013 can solve easily. But it\u2019s not merely a technical issue. It\u2019s about making good judgments, reading shareholders\u2019 mood and knowing instinctively when you\u2019ve overstepped the mark. On those scores, Dowling failed. The vote was merely advisory, so Dudley will keep his winnings if he is sufficiently bloody minded, but the message to Dowling in that 59% figure is straightforward. She should resign. Bailey\u2019s Burberry honeymoon period over It is almost two years since Christopher Bailey, Burberry\u2019s lauded (rightly) chief designer, also became its chief executive, thereby becoming a sort of superstar player-manager. The obvious difficulty in doing two big jobs at once is that there are only 24 hours in the day, to which the corporate answer was not to worry. Bailey was \u201cone of this generation\u2019s greatest visionaries\u201d, declared his predecessor Angela Ahrendts, and anyway chief operating officer John Smith would be on hand to deal with fuddy-duddy details like negotiating an exit from licensing contracts in Japan. For a while, all went swimmingly. Burberry\u2019s share price was at about the \u00a315 mark when Bailey started his dual role in May 2014 and by the following spring it was \u00a319. Now, though, it is \u00a312.96, falling 3.6% on Thursday\u2019s mild profits warning, and has been as low as \u00a311. One cannot, of course, conclude that Bailey\u2019s heavy workload has played any role in Burberry\u2019s weaker run. The company is not alone among upmarket labels in finding that Chinese tourists aren\u2019t spending as freely as they were. What\u2019s more, fashionistas say the Burberry clobber retains the right edge. But the company needs to be careful. One more trading setback and the unorthodox dual role will invite tougher scrutiny from shareholders. Bailey could help himself by explaining how the system works in practice and whether it is sustainable indefinitely. If the sometimes-rumoured bid for Burberry ever materialises, the issue will be top of the agenda. Alexa Chung\u2019s M&amp;S line hit by stock trouble Those Alexa Chung outfits at Marks &amp; Spencer look terrific; no wonder the collection grabbed oodles of editorial space in the papers. And that \u00a389 khaki trenchcoat is perfectly pitched for the M&amp;S shopper \u2013 a sure-fire winner that surely even M&amp;S couldn\u2019t forget to stock in sufficient quantities, as it did before with coats and skirts in recent years. Well, at 6pm on Thursday the Frances Trench was unavailable online in five of seven sizes. Don\u2019t worry, says M&amp;S, we\u2019ve bought with confidence this time, it\u2019s just a matter of getting the garments into the distribution centre.

      "bodyText": "Discount chain Poundland has admitted that buying its lossmaking rival 99p Stores has hit sales just when the existing chain was already being battered by a slump in the number of high street shoppers. The \u00a355m takeover of the rival chain was delayed by a six-month investigation by the competition regulator during which time 99p Stores lost its credit insurance, which meant the retailer was cut off by many suppliers, leaving it with empty shelves. \u201cWe expected 99p Stores to be in poor shape and we weren\u2019t disappointed,\u201d said Poundland\u2019s chief executive, Jim McCarthy. The Competition and Markets Authority finally gave the deal the all-clear last autumn but the holdup saw 1,000 staff quit 99p Stores, McCarthy said. To stem losses from 99p Stores\u2019 251 shops, Poundland was forced to condense the planned 15-month refurbishment programme into four months. The job will now be finished by the end of this month. At the same time the main Poundland chain was hit by a drop in footfall on high streets around the country and a fierce price war among the major supermarkets. McCarthy said the rapid overhaul meant it had to second 70 head office staff and store managers, while the extra stock required put pressure on availability in Poundland stores that sell everything from washing powder to bags of sweets and batteries. Like-for-like sales have slumped 4.9% over the last six months. \u201cWe had a much poorer performance on availability until it settled down to a normal pattern,\u201d explained McCarthy of the headache involved in a deal that increased its footprint by 56% overnight. \u201cIn some cases we had too much stock and others too little. This was an asset deal and we expected it to be in bad shape but it was worse than we expected it to be. We had just under 1,000 vacancies in the stores, as faced with uncertainty, people had gone to get a job somewhere else.\u201d In the wake of the upheaval Poundland said it was slowing the rate of store openings in the new financial year. It still expects to meet City forecasts of a pre-tax profit, before 99p Stores trading losses, of \u00a339m in the year to 27 March. However, analysts were worried about the deterioration in trading, and the shares lost 3%. Stifel analyst James Collins was concerned about the loss of momentum. \u201cManagement continues to cite disruption from the 99p Stores conversion programme and a tough retail market,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth are valid reasons to believe that trading could improve over time, but there are structural pressures on the Poundland proposition that will not ease.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Housebuilder Persimmon has been forced to defend the appointment of non-executive director Nigel Mills after shareholders came close to rejecting him over his links to the company\u2019s financial advisers, Citi. At the company\u2019s annual meeting at York racecourse on Thursday shareholders elected Mills, a senior adviser at Citi, by a narrow margin \u2013 with 107m votes in favour, 96m votes against and 730,000 votes withheld. Before the meeting investor groups had raised concerns that he would not be independent. Speaking at the meeting, the chairman, Nicholas Wrigley, said the board had considered the issue very carefully and was \u201ctotally convinced\u201d that Mills was the right person. \u201cWe respect shareholders\u2019 opinions but we believe Nigel is independent and his appointment is in line with the provisions of the UK corporate governance code,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of us have known him for some time and have seen him in operation and believe he will bring significant skills and values to the board,\u201d said Wrigley, who stressed that Mills had had nothing to do with Persimmon\u2019s business for the past three years. \u201cHowever, given that a significant minority have voted against him on the back of this [Institutional Shareholder Services] report, I intend to meet shareholders over the course of the next few months [to discuss the matter].\u201d The investor body ISS advised shareholders against approving tMills to the Persimmon board because of his employment with Citi, which, they concluded, meant he would not be independent. The ISS also noted that Mills sits on Persimmon\u2019s remuneration committee, which is meant to be entirely staffed by independent directors. The Institutional Voting Information Service (Ivis), which provides corporate governance research to investors, also highlighted the relationship between Mills and Citi, issuing an amber alert, its second highest level of warning, to raise concerns. Investors at Persimmon\u2019s AGM also raised doubts about a share scheme set up in 2012 which could hand out an estimated \u00a3600m to 150 directors by 2022. Mark Bentley, a Persimmon shareholder and director at the individual shareholder society Share Soc, said many other individual investors shared his concern about the scheme. \u201cAs a shareholder I\u2019m outraged that executives really have the best of both worlds, with massive private equity-style rewards in the event of success but also strong salaries and bonuses irrespective of what happens to the business,\u201d he said. \u201cReally it seems fair that it should be either/or and not both.\u201d Wrigley told shareholders on Thursday he found it \u201crather disappointing\u201d that people had failed to focus on the fact that the remuneration was \u201ca big number spread over up to nine and half years rather than an annual award, which is by definition much smaller\u201d. \u201cI am comfortable that actually \u2013 as we are repeatedly being told by shareholders that they want remuneration to be linked to the long-term shareholder value \u2013 we have a long-term scheme,\u201d he said. \u201cIt then infuriates me that we get criticised. So shareholders have to make their minds up, approve it and then let it run its course.\u201d In a trading update before the annual meeting Persimmon said sales revenues had risen 8% to \u00a32.15bn since the start of the year. Weekly private sales per site were 6% ahead of last year as the company sold 7,598 new homes, with an average selling price of \u00a3220,000, up 5.8%.",

Deep inside Threadneedle Street, the nine members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee have gathered for an emergency meeting. The result of the referendum has come as a surprise, intensifying the market turmoil. Polls had suggested a tight race but the assumption had been that the don\u2019t knows would eventually opt for the status quo. The pollsters were wrong. For months, the Bank has been thinking about what it will do in these circumstances. It has been monitoring whether consumers have been changing their spending habits and whether firms have been mothballing investment plans. But now it is crunch time: the MPC has to decide how to respond to the shock news. Some members of the MPC point to the impact of the falling pound on inflation. The expectation is that sterling will depreciate by 20%, making Britain\u2019s exports more competitive but pushing up the cost of imports. On balance, the sharp drop in the exchange rate will increase the annual inflation rate at a time when the cost of living has been gradually rising anyway. Other members argue that the bigger threat is not inflation \u2013 still running at below 1% \u2013 but the impact on growth. They say the uncertainty about the economic outlook is likely to push down demand in the short term. The economy has been slowing in the run-up to the referendum: now there is a risk it will be tipped into recession. A dress rehearsal for this debate has already taken place. The minutes from the April MPC meeting suggest that the Bank is fully alive to the risks of Brexit and its knock-on consequences for the economy. So how would the Bank respond? The minutes talk about \u201ccareful judgments\u201d made after weighing up everything from falling asset prices to the likely impact of lower immigration. In truth, the decision would be a relatively simple one: interest rates would be cut. In part, this would be a confidence-building move. More importantly, it would send out a signal that the Bank was responding to events. Consider what would happen if the MPC sat on its hands after a Brexit vote.

      "bodyText": "A vote to leave the EU could harm economic growth and have a serious impact on the pound and other UK assets, the Bank of England has said, as it took steps to prepare for June\u2019s referendum. Minutes to the Bank\u2019s latest policy meeting showed its nine-strong monetary policy committee voted unanimously to leave interest rates at their historic low of 0.5%. The committee said uncertainty ahead of what was expected to be a close EU vote appeared to be weighing on investment decisions, and policymakers said economic growth could slow as a result in the second quarter of the year. The minutes showed that as the 23 June vote nears, policymakers discussed the likely implications for monetary policy of a vote to leave the EU. \u201cSuch a vote might result in an extended period of uncertainty about the economic outlook, including about the prospects for export growth. This uncertainty would be likely to push down on demand in the short term,\u201d the minutes said. \u201cA vote to leave could have significant implications for asset prices, in particular the exchange rate. The MPC would have to make careful judgements about the next effects of these potential influences on demand, supply and inflation. Ultimately, monetary policy would be set in order to meet the inflation target, while also ensuring that inflation expectations remained anchored.\u201d A Reuters poll this week found that 17 of 26 economists thought a vote for Brexit could prompt the Bank to cut interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis. The minutes continued: \u201cWhatever the outcome of the referendum, the MPC would use its tools to achieve its inflation remit.\u201d The Bank highlighted signs that increased uncertainty might already be beginning to weigh on demand, among them reports of deferred investment decisions, delayed private equity deals and company flotations, and reports from lenders that demand for finance from large companies had dipped. \u201cTaken together, these developments highlighted the risk that the economy could slow somewhat in the second quarter,\u201d the minutes said. They also said it would be harder to read data over the coming months. \u201cReferendum effects are likely to make macroeconomic and financial market indicators harder to interpret over the next few months, and the committee is likely to react more cautiously to data news over this period than would normally be the case,\u201d they said. The Bank\u2019s policymakers reiterated their previous message that when interest rates do start to rise they will do so \u201cmore gradually and to a lower level than in recent cycles\u201d. Surveys and official figures have pointed to a slowdown in the UK economy in recent months, with some companies saying they are delaying hiring and investment decisions until after the EU referendum. The minutes follow a warning from the International Monetary Fund this week that a British vote to leave the EU risked doing damage to the whole region, spilling over into an already fragile global economy. In its latest World Economic Outlook the IMF downgraded its growth forecast for the UK to 1.9% for 2016, compared with a forecast for 2.2% made in January.",

    "webTitle": "JD Sports profits rise 45% as new stores open across Europe", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "JD Sports has revealed a 45% jump in annual profits after a surge in demand for women\u2019s sports clothing. Sales at the group\u2019s sports fashion stores, which include JD Sports, Size? and Scotts, rose by 11.6% in the year to 30 January as the company said it had also benefited from being the \u201cdominant\u201d retailer for top brands\u2019 new product launches. \u201cBecause we are the aspirational retailer we get first access and possibly exclusive access [to new launches],\u201d said Peter Cowgill, the executive chairman. He said the company did have competition from chains with a smaller presence in the UK, such as Foot Locker, but that its much bigger potential rival Sports Direct \u201cservices a different part of the market\u201d. He said sales of womenswear were growing even faster than the 10%-plus seen across the group\u2019s sports chains as major brands sought to cash in on the catwalk-led trend for \u201cathleisure\u201d clothing. The likes of Nike and Adidas sportswear were expanding their clothing ranges to include the kind of sportswear worn increasingly outside the gym. JD Sports, Nike and Size? have all opened women-only stores to meet demand. Cowgill said he saw no sign of the trend slowing down and JD would be one of only a handful of outlets selling Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s athleisure line, Ivy Park, which launches on Thursday in partnership with the Topshop owner, Sir Philip Green. \u201cIt is about moving forward all the time and not staying still. Recognising the level of appeal and satisfying that by moving with trends,\u201d Cowgill said. Shares in JD rose nearly 2.5% to \u00a311.89 as the company revealed better than expected pre-tax profits of \u00a3131.6m in the year to 31 January \u2013 up from \u00a390.5m the previous year. Excluding one-off items, profits were up by 57% to \u00a3157.1m. The sports fashion division posted an operating profit before one-off items of \u00a3162.9m, a rise of 49% as the strong rise in underlying sales offset fixed costs. Margins improved as the retailer did less discounting on its autumn and winter ranges than in the previous year. Rebecca Marks, an analyst at the consultancy Verdict Retail, said the results reflected the retailer\u2019s \u201cstrong relationship with its suppliers and improved buying and merchandising disciplines \u2013 representing a crucial key differentiator from its fierce rival Sports Direct\u201d. But she said it would be \u201ca challenge to maintain this level of growth in the longer term\u201d. JD is planning to open more stores in the UK and mainland Europe, where it now has 103 JD outlets and about 180 other stores, including the Chausport chain in France and Sprinter in Spain. The group opened a net 38 JD stores across Europe last year, including a new flagship store in Amsterdam, and Cowgill said he expected that level of expansion to continue, subject to strict investment criteria. The group also plans to open more stores in Malaysia after opening its first location outside Europe at Sunway Pyramid shopping centre near Kuala Lumpur. JD has been outperforming Sports Direct, owned by the billionaire Mike Ashley, which issued a profit warning in January. JD\u2019s stock market valuation overtook that of Sports Direct last month, but now stands at \u00a32.31bn, compared with Sports Direct\u2019s \u00a32.39bn. The latter owns a 6.9% stake in JD \u2013 the company\u2019s second biggest investor behind Pentland Group, the owner of Speedo and Berghaus. JD has been trying to turn around its loss-making outdoor business by bringing the Blacks, Millets and Ultimate Outdoors brands under common leadership. The division\u2019s operating losses were reduced to \u00a34m from \u00a37.1m, with the Blacks and Millets stores breaking even. The losses were mainly caused by costs related to the larger Ultimate Outdoors stores, which are still being developed.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Mothercare have plunged after the baby goods chain reported that shoppers stayed away from its non-UK stores, particularly across the Middle East and China. Mothercare, which has 170 stores in the UK and 1,310 overseas, said on Thursday that sales fell in all four international regions in the 11 weeks to 26 March. Sales were down by 9.7% measured at constant currencies and dropped by 10.8% in actual currencies. In the Middle East, customers spent less because of the slump in oil prices, while China recorded weaker consumer confidence amid the country\u2019s economic slowdown. Europe and Latin America were affected by adverse currency moves. Mothercare is in the middle of a turnaround programme that doubled overall half-year profits in January and halved its UK losses. The shares fell on Thursday by nearly 20% to 152.5p. The UK fared better, with like-for-like sales rising for the eighth quarter in a row, up by 2.1%. Online sales increased by 5.6% and now account for more than one-third of Mothercare\u2019s UK sales. Total UK sales were up by 0.8%. Margins continued to improve as the retailer ditched its discount-heavy approach and pushed more full-price products. Mothercare said it still expects underlying full-year profits to meet market expectations. The company, which owns the Early Learning Centre, has been refitting some stores and closing others, as well as improving its website, as part of a turnaround effort kicked off by its chief executive, Mark Newton-Jones, two years ago. He said: \u201cIn the UK, we have delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of positive like-for-like sales growth, with a full year of improved margins. Almost 40% of space is now in the new and much-improved format which, along with a revamped online offer, improved product and service, are being well received by our customers.\u201d There was no let-up on the international front, however. \u201cIn the year ahead, we expect to make further progress in the UK. However, our international markets are likely to remain challenging with the current trends in space, sales and currency continuing into the new financial year,\u201d Newton-Jones said. Honor Westnedge, a lead analyst at consultancy Verdict Retail, said: \u201cMothercare must emphasise its needs-driven and essential product offer to new parents, as demand for this product is still there but price-led rivals will be luring shoppers away. Customer service to showcase Mothercare\u2019s specialism is essential to differentiate its proposition \u2013 a strategy that is delivering results in the UK.\u201d",

In a trading update on Thursday morning ahead of its annual meeting at York Racecourse, which could involve protests over executive pay and other issues, Persimmon said sales revenues had risen 8% to \u00a32.15bn since the start of the year. Weekly private sales per site were 6% ahead of last year as the company sold 7,598 new homes, with an average selling price of \u00a3220,000, up 5.8%. Analysts said the numbers suggested sales had slowed in recent weeks. Charlie Campbell, of Liberum, said: \u201cPersimmon has seen a good start to 2016, with sales rates up 6%, but this implies that growth has moderated in the last seven weeks, to around 2.5%, as comparatives have strengthened.\u201d He added that margins were peaking \u201cas selling price inflation moderates and build cost inflation persists\u201d. Persimmon shares fell nearly 6% to \u00a319.07 in early trading. At the same time, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors warned that the EU referendum in June and recent changes to stamp duty had created a climate of uncertainty that could lead to falling sales and prices in the housing market. Shares in other housebuilders were also down, with Berkeley Group falling nearly 4% and Barratt down 2%. Persimmon reiterated that housebuilding was being held back by planning delays. So far it has opened 75 of 100 new sites planned for the first half of the year. The company\u2019s AGM is one of the first of the AGM season. Shareholder groups have issued warnings over a share scheme set up in 2012 that could hand an estimated \u00a3600m to 150 directors by 2022 \u2013 one of the most generous bonus schemes in the City. A retiring senior executive, Nigel Greenaway, who has led Persimmon\u2019s southern division, could pocket up to \u00a39.4m. Some are also unhappy over Persimmon\u2019s appointment of Nigel Mills as a non-executive director, questioning his independence due to his links with the housebuilder\u2019s financial advisers, Citi. The company sought to defend the share plan by saying that since the launch of its new strategy in early 2012, it had delivered a 56% increase in new homes built, invested more than \u00a32.2bn in new land, and returned \u00a31.071bn to shareholders \u2013 \u00a3550m more than was originally planned.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BP chief executive Bob Dudley will face shareholders on Thursday amid investor anger over his \u00a313.8m pay package, after the oil company posted its worst-ever annual loss. The Institute of Directors made a rare intervention on executive pay ahead of the AGM, urging BP shareholders to think twice before backing Dudley\u2019s pay award. Simon Walker, the IOD director general, said the enormous remuneration deal for 2015 sent \u201cthe wrong message\u201d to investors and other boards, given the \u00a34.5bn annual loss and the decision to axe 7,000 jobs. His comments came on the eve of what is likely to be a stormy BP meeting in London, with the oil company facing criticism over a range of issues including controversial new drilling plans in waters off Australia. \u201cIt is rare that the IoD intervenes on the subject of an individual chief executive\u2019s pay. We are concerned, however, that Mr Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m pay package will seem unjustified to many shareholders, considering the performance of the company over the past 12 months,\u201d said Walker. Like other oil companies BP was hit hard by a collapse in oil prices last year, but the company argued that Dudley had done a good job in difficult circumstances. A BP spokesman said: \u201cDespite the very challenging environment, BP\u2019s safety and operating performance was excellent throughout 2015 and management also responded early and decisively to the steep fall in the oil price.\u201d He added that BP\u2019s performance had surpassed the board\u2019s expectations on almost all of the measures that determine remuneration \u2013 and that the oil company\u2019s investors had agreed to the pay deal. \u201cThese clear measures derive directly from BP\u2019s remuneration policy, which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM with over 96% of the vote.\u201d Aberdeen Asset Management is expected to be among a pack of major investors voting against Dudley\u2019s pay after it stated that BP\u2019s remuneration awards were \u201coverly complex\u201d. But it said it was \u201csupportive of management\u2019s strategy\u201d and was \u201csure the company will take note of shareholders feedback\u201d. Shareholder group Sharesoc has branded the pay deal \u201csimply too high\u201d, while Royal London Asset Management, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services have also expressed their opposition. However, any vote against his pay deal is only advisory and will not lead to the package being blocked. The pay deal will raise Dudley\u2019s salary from \u00a31.27m in 2014 to \u00a31.3 million for 2015, while his annual cash bonus will also rise from \u00a3702,733 in 2014 to \u00a3976,799 for last year. The bulk of Dudley\u2019s remuneration package is mnade up of pension and share options. Pressure to reject the pay deal comes after some shareholders also expressed anger over his pay ahead of BP\u2019s AGM in 2015, when his remuneration received a 5% hike. BP said in January that it would have to axe a further 3,000 jobs worldwide in its downstream business \u2013 including refining, marketing and distribution \u2013 by the end of 2017, on top of the 4,000 cuts announced last year under a swingeing overhaul to slash costs. The group\u2019s remuneration policy is voted on every three years, with the next vote taking place at the AGM in 2017.",

      "bodyText": "Burberry\u2019s share price has taken a dive after it reported a sales slowdown in Europe, as wealthy Chinese shoppers stayed away from the region following the terrorist attacks in Paris in November. The luxury fashion brand warned that a \u201cchallenging\u201d environment would push full-year profits in the year ahead to the bottom of analyst expectations. In a trading update for the second half of the financial year, Burberry said: \u201cContinental Europe slowed in the fourth quarter as sales from the travelling luxury customer, particularly the Chinese, declined year-on-year, offset in part by growth from domestic customers. The UK and Middle East remained difficult throughout the half.\u201d Burberry was one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100, with shares down 5% at \u00a312.78. Demand for Burberry goods fell in France, Germany, Spain and Italy amid a general sense of unease about security and fears of further terrorist attacks in Europe. Carol Fairweather, Burberry\u2019s chief financial officer, said the brand was being hit by a \u201csignificant decline in tourists visiting Europe, probably following the events in Paris. Subsequently we have seen fewer tourists in continental Europe, particularly Chinese tourists\u201d. She added that the UK had also been challenging. \u201cClearly events in Paris and Brussels have an impact on sentiment.\u201d Burberry\u2019s like-for-like sales \u2013 excluding stores open for less than a year \u2013 fell 2% in the six months to 31 March. The fourth quarter was particularly weak, with sales down 5%. Trading at Burberry was weak across all of its key divisions, including Asia Pacific \u2013 the largest part of its business. Sales fell 20% in Hong Kong, but rose in mainland China. Steve Clayton, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the trading update was \u201ca dispiriting affair\u201d. He added: \u201cBurberry\u2019s long-term performance has been excellent, but the current slowdown in Chinese demand has caused weakness in the share price, since a peak of over 1870p in February 2015. \u201cLuxury consumers are not risk-free clients, but they tend to be resilient, because wealth is typically more durable than income. But Burberry seem to have a particular problem in Hong Kong and are suffering from the wider reluctance of Chinese tourists to spend like they used to.\u201d Total revenue at Burberry was down 1% in the second half, at \u00a31.41bn. The company said profits for the full year that ended in March 2016 were expected to be in line with City expectations. However, Burberry issued a warning about the current financial year: \u201cWe currently expect full-year 2017 adjusted profit before tax to be around the bottom of the range of analysts\u2019 expectations.\u201d Andrew Hall, analyst at Verdict Retail, said good work at Burberry was being overshadowed by falling demand in Hong Kong and Macau. In the second half of the financial year, Burberry said accessories were popular, in particular scarves and ponchos, as well as the new season \u201crunway rucksack\u201d and Banner bag. Fairweather said that despite the fall in sales, Burberry\u2019s \u201cbrand momentum\u201d remained strong, and new products were resonating with customers. The company said that in a challenging luxury market, it would focus on cutting costs and improving productivity and efficiency.",

      "bodyText": "Fresh doubt has been cast on the ability of George Osborne to sell off the state\u2019s remaining stake in Royal Bank of Scotland at a profit following remarks by the outgoing head of the Treasury. The chancellor sold off the first tranche of a 79% stake in the bailed-out bank in August at a \u00a31bn loss and Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the outgoing permanent secretary, has admitted the rest may have to be sold below the break-even price. Asked whether there was a case for selling off the rest of the shares below the crucial 502p average at which the 79% stake was bought in 2008 and 2009, Macpherson told the Financial Times (\u00a3): \u201cI think that is the judgment which will have to be made.\u201d The chancellor\u2019s hopes of receiving almost \u00a330bn from the sale of the shares by the end of this parliament in 2020 were called into question earlier this year by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), with data appearing to show a \u00a323bn loss at current share prices. The fall in the RBS share price between the March 2015 budget and last November\u2019s autumn statement mean the OBR reduced the value of the RBS stake from \u00a334bn to \u00a325bn. The first 5 percentage point stake was sold in August, cutting the taxpayer stake to 73%. At the time the shares were sold at 330p. They now trade at 224p. The Treasury said the government remained absolutely determined to return RBS to the private sector. \u201cLast year, the chancellor received independent advice from the [Bank of England] governor stating that it was in the public interest for the government to begin the return of RBS to private ownership in the near-term,\u201d it added. \u201cWith that in mind, the government conducted an initial sale of shares in RBS in August 2015, raising \u00a32.1bn for the taxpayer. This was the first step in the government\u2019s plan to maximise value for taxpayers, and based on the independent OBR\u2019s calculations, we can comfortably expect to receive more money back from the interventions in the banks than was put in. \u201cThis is a considerably better result for taxpayers than was considered likely in 2009 when HM Treasury estimated that the cost to the taxpayer would be in the order of \u00a320-50bn. The government will conduct further sales subject to market conditions.\u201d Osborne has already been forced to delay the sale of the government\u2019s remaining stake in Lloyds Banking Group, announcing earlier this year that a public share offering would be delayed because of market conditions. Osborne cut the Lloyds stake from 73% to around 9% through a series of sales to leading City investors and had pledged to keep some back for a discounted offer to private investors. But its shares are now trading below the 73.6p break-even price at 69p. Macpherson said it was \u201cgoing to be tricky\u201d to sell off the rest of the RBS stake before the next parliament. But he told the FT it would boost lending. \u201cMy experience of running banks is that the longer they stay in the public sector the greater the likelihood that you will lose value,\u201d said Macpherson .",

      "bodyText": "Debenhams expects to appoint a new boss in the next few weeks after Michael Sharp confirmed his resignation on Thursday. Revealing a slightly better than expected rise in half-year profits, the company said it was in the final stages of hiring a replacement for Sharp, who has agreed a 12-month notice period starting on Thursday. Sharp will receive full pay and benefits, amounting to at least \u00a3772,999, during his notice period and will continue as chief executive until his successor is confirmed. Potential candidates are thought to include the former Karen Millen and Zara UK boss Mike Shearwood, the Mothercare boss Mark Newton-Jones and the former Matalan and Littlewoods boss Alistair McGeorge. Suzanne Harlow, Debenhams trading director, is a strong internal candidate who many had expected to take over, but shareholders are reportedly pushing for a fresh perspective. Sir Ian Cheshire, who was installed as Debenhams\u2019 chairman earlier this year, thanked Sharp for his service. \u201cHe has led the business through an unprecedented period of change for the sector, leaving the business in good shape for the future as these results demonstrate,\u201d he said. Sharp, who first joined in 1997 and became chief executive in 2011, announced in October that he would leave this year after shareholders agitated for a change of leadership following a string of disappointing results and profit warnings. He said Christmas sales showed his revamped strategy was working. Confirmation of his departure came as Debenhams reported a 5.5% rise in underlying pre-tax profit to \u00a393.8m for the six months to 27 February. Analysts had been expecting the department store chain to post a 2.3% rise in half-year pre-tax profits to \u00a391m. Sales rose 1.6% to \u00a31.63bn, with sales at stores open over a year up 1.1%, and the company revealed its first rise in dividend in three years - up 2.5% o 1.025p per share. Sharp said: \u201cAlthough there is plenty more to do, we are on track to deliver full-year results in line with market expectations. When I leave the business later this year I am confident that it will be in a good position to deliver continued sustainable growth under a strong and capable management team.\u201d He said the increase in the dividend was a clear demonstration of confidence in his strategy. He said Debenhams had improved profit margins by cutting back on discounting and promoting non-clothing lines such as beauty and gifts. Profits were also helped by a reduction in interest payments as the group cut its debts. Sharp said: \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear from external research that the clothing market is tougher at the moment and you can see that in consumer confidence \u2026 But we have got a strategy in place that is working and that is about building non-clothing categories,.\u201d Debenhams\u2019 Christmas sales beat expectations by relying less on discounts and cutting stocks of coats and outerwear to take account of a warmer winter. Sales at stores open a year or more rose 1.9% in the 19 weeks to 9 January, compared with analysts\u2019 forecasts of a rise of just 0.3%.",

      "bodyText": "Ratings agency Moody\u2019s has warned the treasurer, Scott Morrison, Australia\u2019s budget is unlikely to return to surplus by June 2021 with modest spending cuts alone. Last week, Morrison rejected the view that the budget had a revenue problem and said the 3 May budget would focus on spending cuts and not raising revenue. On Thursday, a Moody\u2019s credit outlook report warned \u201cgiven previous difficulties in reducing welfare benefits, actual spending cuts may be modest\u201d. It said the government\u2019s intention to cut spending would be \u201ctested by significant spending commitments on welfare, education and health\u201d. The report noted the government had ruled out a goods and services tax rise and scrapping negative gearing, leaving addressing superannuation tax concessions as a possible source for more revenue. The report said without measures to raise revenue \u201climited spending cuts are unlikely to meaningfully advance the government\u2019s aim of balanced finances by the fiscal year ending June 2021\u201d. Although Australia had a favourable budget position relative to other countries with AAA credit ratings, Moody\u2019s noted Australia\u2019s government debt had risen to 35.1% of GDP in 2015 from 11.6% of GDP 10 years earlier. \u201cWe expect government debt to increase further to around 38% of GDP in 2018,\u201d it said. Climbing government debt is \u201ca credit negative for Australia\u201d, raising the prospect of a credit downgrade in future. Also on Thursday the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said tough decisions were needed on both revenue and spending. He said Labor had announced policies to increase revenue, including those on superannuation tax concessions, tobacco taxes, capital gains tax and negative gearing. \u201cMoody\u2019s has made clear they think to protect the AAA credit rating going forward, the government should adopt a similar approach.\u201d Bowen criticised Morrison for saying Australia only had a spending problem, not a revenue problem. \u201cThe government has failed to offer a plan for the budget or for the economy. This year\u2019s budget deficit has blown out by $33bn. Debt is $100bn higher than it was at the last election\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve outlined $100bn of improvements to the budget bottom line over the next decade, it\u2019s time for Morrison to do the same.\u201d On ABC radio\u2019s AM program on Thursday morning Morrison criticised Labor\u2019s plans to raise more revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to increase the tax burden on the economy by $100bn over 10 years, and then not offer any relief to Australians on tax. What Bill Shorten is proposing to do is increase taxes, not cut taxes, not cut them anywhere,\u201d he said. Responding to the Moody\u2019s report, Morrison said \u201cour plan is to consolidate the budget by being disciplined ... It\u2019s not to say there won\u2019t be revenue measures in the budget\u201d. \u201cOf course there will be revenue measures in the budget but what we\u2019re saying is where we will apply those revenue measures is to reducing the tax burden in other parts of the economy, and wherever possible, to continue to drive down the deficit.\u201d Shorten said Labor would not improve the budget bottom line as it planned to spend all the extra revenue it raised. \u201cJust over the next four years, they are going to increase spending by $60bn if they\u2019re elected, and to pay for that, they\u2019ve got $7bn in higher taxes and just one $1bn in expenditure savings.\u201d He said \u201cexpenditure under this government will continue to fall ... to about 25.3%. The deficit will fall from 2.3% on the current estimates down to 0.7%. We are driving the deficit down.\u201d Morrison said \u201cnext year, revenue will rise to the long-run average of 24.1%. On the current estimates revenue is forecast to rise over the next three or four years.\u201d The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, said the ratings agency had reaffirmed Australia\u2019s AAA credit rating after the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook and \u201cas the treasurer said last night in a speech to the [Business Council of Australia] we are still on track\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Labor has announced a six-point plan to encourage \u2013 but not mandate \u2013 the use of Australian steel in government projects through higher standards and considering a further crackdown on dumping. The government has criticised the policy, saying it amounts to a backdown on comments by the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, last week, questioning what was wrong with mandating the use of Australian steel in government projects. In Wollongong on Thursday Shorten and the opposition spokesman on industry, Kim Carr, said a Labor government would \u201censure Australian standards are upheld in federal government-funded projects and support local producers to meet certification standards\u201d. Carr said imposing Australian standards on steel in government-funded projects when trialled in South Australia had seen the use of Australian steel grow from 40% to 91%. Labor would \u201cseek to maximise the use of locally produced steel in federal government-funded projects and put in place regular reporting of usage levels\u201d. The third prong of the policy would halve thresholds for projects which require Australian industry participation from $500m to $250m for private projects, and from $20m to $10m for public projects. The remaining components would double funding for the Australian industry participation authority, create a national steel supplier advocate and \u201censure Australia\u2019s anti-dumping system has the right powers and penalties in place\u201d. When asked what maximising use of Australian steel meant, Shorten reiterated the plans to expand use of industrial participation plans and crack down on dumping. \u201cEach point of the plan represents the other,\u201d he said. In a statement Shorten and Carr said: \u201cSteel is a strategically significant industry for Australia. We must not become the only advanced economy in the world to let our steel industry die.\u201d Australia\u2019s steel industry was under significant pressure from low international prices, the high cost of raw materials, weak domestic demand and dumping of steel from overseas into the domestic market. The announcement comes after Australian steel producer Arrium went into administration on Thursday, putting 8,000 jobs at risk. \u201cTo secure the long-term future of our local metal industries, we need to make smart use of the opportunities in front of us and build on Australia\u2019s natural strengths,\u201d they said. The innovation and industry minister, Christopher Pyne, said the policy amounted to a backdown: Pyne said Shorten \u201chasn\u2019t got the faintest clue what he\u2019s talking about in terms of industry policy\u201d. \u201cLast week he was insisting all government contracts for construction of steel be done by Australian steelmakers, creating a monopoly for construction steel and flat steel,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only losers out of that are the consumer, the taxpayers of Australia, and of course it is was likely to breach six free trade agreements. \u201cHe\u2019s wildly trying to come up with a new policy idea.\u201d Pyne said the government was bringing forward large construction projects such as the Adelaide-to-Tarcoola rail line and using anti-dumping powers to prevent unfair competition. He wanted to encourage the local industry and said the government had had an industry participation policy for government procurement for many years: \u201cNone of these ideas are new ideas that Shorten and others have come up with.\u201d Shorten denied the steel policy amounted to an increase in red tape: \u201cI believe our policy of maximising Australian steel will see great value for projects using Australian steel.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday the IMF released its latest 6 monthly world economic report, which is basically its half yearly reminder that things aren\u2019t as good now as they thought they would be. The IMF has downgraded economic growth in 2016 and 2017 for the world, advanced nations, and for Australia. However amid the gloom the IMF sees Australia\u2019s employment holding up well and it continues its long standing recommendation that governments make use of the low interest rates and invest in infrastructure to help boost growth. This time last year the IMF was doing its best to find some positives. Its world economic report was titled Uneven Growth: Short- and Long-Term Factors which, if not overflowing in optimism, was at least better than the one in October 2014 \u2013 Legacies, Clouds, Uncertainties. The pessimism, however, has returned with the IMF barely being able to contain its disappointment, titling the latest report Too Slow for Too Long. I guess it\u2019s more upbeat than calling it The New Normal: Yep, it Still Sucks. And the downgrades reflected the continued ability for the world economy to keep growing slower than expected. In April last year the IMF predicted world GDP growth in 2016 would be 3.8%. In the October 2015 report it was revised down to 3.6%. In the short January update it was revised down to 3.4%. And in this month\u2019s report \u2013 stop me if you have heard this before \u2013 it was revised down to 3.2%: The one little bit of good news is that there has been a very slight upgrade in the estimate for GDP growth in \u201cdeveloping Asia\u201d \u2013 that is, China \u2013 up from 6.3% to 6.4%. But this is not enough to counter the falls in estimated growth in the advanced nations like the USA, UK, Japan and the Euro area. It does however reflect that China continues to be the driver of world growth for the next decade: And just to keep thing all nice and consistent, the IMF also reduced its estimates for world GDP growth next year as well. The 3.5% expected growth for 2017 is at least better than they expect the world to grow this year, but it is not as good as they hoped it would be in January or last October, let alone the 3.9% it predicted 12 months ago: The downgrades are fairly consistent as well across the major economies. In Europe only Spain is a major economy where the outlook is not worse. The biggest downgrade however is reserved for the UK: The IMF argues that the coming Brexit referendum \u201chas already created uncertainty for investors\u201d and should the UK leave the EU, it \u201ccould do severe regional and global damage by disrupting established trading relationships\u201d. For Australia the picture is also a bit sad on the GDP front, but less so for unemployment. Predictions of GDP growth for this year have been revised down from 2.9% in October last year to 2.5%. Japan and the USA also have major growth downgrades. In Japan\u2019s case it is due to lower than expected consumption and for the USA it comes mainly from the impact of weak export growth and poor domestic demand: The future view for Australia\u2019s GDP isn\u2019t that great either. The IMF has downgraded its prediction for growth in 2017, although by 2018 it expects things to be back on track (although to be honest, predicting GDP growth three years out is real dartboard stuff \u2013 three years ago the IMF thought Australia\u2019s economy would be growing at 3.5% this year). But the relatively strong performance of our employment sector is also reflected in the IMF\u2019s projections. Whereas 12 months ago the IMF expected our unemployment rate to peak at 6.4%, it now expects the worst to be behind us: The title \u201ctoo slow for too long\u201d becomes apparent when you look at the IMF\u2019s predictions for growth out to 2021. Across the advanced economies (which includes most of the OECD economies plus a few others such as Singapore and Hong Kong) GDP growth is not expected to average over 2% any time between now and 2021 \u2013 compared to this occurring six times between 2000 and 2007: The too slow for too long aspect is also very much apparent when you consider that across the 34 OECD nations, only Denmark, Mexico and Portugal are expected to have higher average annual GDP growth from 2015-2021 than they experienced in the 7 years prior to the GFC: So what is the solution to this speeding up this slow growth? Much as it has in the past 2 years, the IMF recommends central banks keep interest rates low. It also keeps up its long held view that \u201cmonetary policy cannot bear the entire burden\u201d, and instead there must also be \u201cother policies that directly boost supply and demand\u201d. Among these policies are investment in infrastructure. The IMF argues that such investment \u201cis needed across a range of countries\u201d and that such investment should be \u201cattractive\u201d given the current low interest rates available to many governments. The report argues that those countries with \u201cfiscal space should not wait to take advantage of it\u201d (my emphasis). So get out your shovel-ready projects and get digging. But the IMF also argues for something that may perhaps be more appealing to Treasurer Scott Morrison \u2013 namely income tax relief. The report notes that reducing the average tax wedge (the difference between your wage and what you actually take home) by 1% can increase the level of employment by about 0.2% in that year and by about 0.7% after four years. This argument is timely considering yesterday the OECD also released the latest figures for tax wedges which showed that in 2015 Australia\u2019s average tax wedge for a single person on average weekly earnings was the highest it has been since 2005. It\u2019s a tough mix however \u2013 increased infrastructure spending, keeping \u201cfiscal space (ie not causing debt to increase in such a way that causes interest rates paid by the government to rise) and also reducing tax rates. And the difficulty involved is why the IMF\u2019s pessimism is likely to continue and perhaps why when talking of the \u201cnew normal\u201d of slow growth we may soon no longer need to include mention of \u201cnew\u201d.",
