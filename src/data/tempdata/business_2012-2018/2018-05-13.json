      "bodyText": "The UK has no need to build new large gas-fired power stations to replace the coal plants that the government has pledged to switch off by 2025, the World Wide Fund for Nature has argued. The gap can instead be filled by renewables, battery storage and flexible technologies, allowing the UK to go from \u201ccoal to clean\u201d and skip new gas completely, according to a report by the environmental group. The analysis challenges the orthodoxy that phasing out coal will require large new gas plants. Amber Rudd, when energy secretary in 2015, said: \u201cIn the next 10 years, it\u2019s imperative that we get new gas-fired power stations built.\u201d Big energy firms including Drax and Germany\u2019s RWE want to build large-scale gas plants on the sites of former power stations in Yorkshire and Essex, respectively. Almost half of the gas industry\u2019s hopes for new power stations for Europe are slated for the UK but developers have failed to win subsidy contracts through the main route to market, the government\u2019s capacity market. The government is planning to launch a review of the scheme later this year, which renewables proponents fear could tilt the balance. Gareth Redmond-King, the WWF\u2019s head of climate and energy, urged ministers to ensure the review does not open the door to gas. He said: \u201cIf we don\u2019t need large-scale gas, if it can\u2019t compete with renewables and there\u2019s no need for it, why would you need a route to market for it? \u201cIt is essential the government does not substitute one dirty power source for another.\u201d The last large gas plant to be built in the UK was in Carrington in 2016 \u2013 the first since 2012. Using official government forecasts, the WWF found that the growth in electricity produced by wind, solar and other renewables would more than replace the lost power from old coal plants. Around 95% of that renewable energy capacity is already being built or contracted under government subsidy deals. Most of the growth will come from windfarms out at sea. The government has allocated a \u00a3557m pot of funding for more renewables subsidies between now and 2025. That should bring forward the remainder of the new capacity needed as coal drops off the grid. WWF also called on the government to reconsider support for solar power and onshore windfarms, both of which have had subsidies axed. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to remind the government there are other cheap renewables [beyond offshore wind] that they could be supporting,\u201d Redmond-King said. He added that he was encouraged by recent comments from the energy minister, Claire Perry, who has said the government is working \u201creally hard\u201d to allow onshore windfarms to be built with public subsidies in Scotland and Wales but not England. A spokesperson for Drax said: \u201cA reliable power system depends on a range of generation technologies to provide crucial system support services.\u201d Tom Glover, the UK country chair for RWE, said: \u201cThe exact amount of gas capacity required is extremely uncertain but the vast majority of forecasts anticipate a significantly higher requirement than suggested in this report.\u201d A BEIS spokesperson said:\u201cWe are one of the first countries to commit to end unabated coal power and are leading the world in encouraging other countries to make the same commitment. With clean growth a key pillar of our modern industrial strategy, we are growing our economy while cutting emissions. \u201cWith up to \u00a3557m of investment in new clean energy projects we have a diverse energy mix that is secure, affordable and providing more clean power than ever before.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The last time we heard on these pages from the family of Beatrice Bellman \u2013 Maureen Lipman\u2019s carping character Beattie in those old British Telecom advertisements \u2013 her tribe was troubled. Henpecked son Melvyn was approaching an extremely well-earned retirement, while grandson Anthony was in the prime of his career, having heroically shrugged off his memorable disappointment at only attaining exam passes in pottery (\u201cAnthony, people will always need plates\u201d) and sociology (\u201che gets an \u2018ology\u2019 and he says he\u2019s failed!\u201d). The problem they were facing was that their employer, BT Group, could not afford to pay the pensions it had promised both men when each joined the company, and it needed to come up with a fudge. Last week, after numerous stalled attempts, the plan arrived. The good news for Melvyn and Anthony is that about \u00a32bn of BT\u2019s cash, plus a further \u00a32bn raised from a bond and a decade\u2019s worth of \u00a3900m annual contributions, will now be stuffed into the pension fund, which is around \u00a311.3bn in deficit. The bad news is that this announcement was part of a wider modernisation package that will see about 13,000 staff lose their jobs \u2013 which, considering their ages, is probably worse news for the younger Anthony than the more mature Melvyn. Quite how we all afford the dotages we have come to expect is a worry for many more families than the fictional Bellmans, and the BT announcement is a reminder of how few perfect solutions there are in this sphere. Companies must fund the retirement pledges made to their employees. They also need to pay dividends to the City so that different pension schemes can operate effectively for other workers. Simultaneously, firms must invest in their businesses and provide jobs for staff like Anthony, who, judging from his history, might not relish a return to school to retrain. You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that this system is destroying itself, to borrow from Marx (in a shocking departure for this column, that\u2019s Karl, not Groucho). And precisely that quandary will emerge again this week, when another former state monopoly, Royal Mail, announces its results. Like BT, Royal Mail is also trying to rework what it fears will become company-crushing pension commitments \u2013 but in a far more original way.Typically, there are two types of pension scheme: the traditional defined-benefit scheme, where you get a set pension, which companies complain is unaffordable; or, the more modern defined-contribution scheme, where your pension depends on how much is in your personal pot, and which workers complain make retirements unaffordable. The twist with Royal Mail is that it has agreed with the Communications Workers Union to offer a hybrid solution \u2013 a so-called collective defined contribution (CDC) scheme where the fund aims for, rather than promises, a certain payout. The idea is that all employees pay into a collective fund (like defined-benefit) and not a personal pot (as in defined-contribution). Investment returns can then be enhanced for everyone, as fund managers do not have to hedge bets as each person nears retirement. Meanwhile, employers reckon it\u2019s more affordable because the firm is not on the hook for a set payout, as it is in defined-benefit. At least, that\u2019s the theory. CDC schemes don\u2019t exist at all in this country and the law would need to be changed to allow them. Meanwhile, even Royal Mail admits that there isn\u2019t much anywhere else in the world that is comparable. So will this work? To answer that, you might need to ask somebody so bright, and with such foresight, that they have gained an exam pass in an \u201cology\u201d. Astrology, that is.",

Henpecked son Melvyn was approaching an extremely well-earned retirement, while grandson Anthony was in the prime of his career, having heroically shrugged off his memorable disappointment at only attaining exam passes in pottery (\u201cAnthony, people will always need plates\u201d) and sociology (\u201che gets an \u2018ology\u2019 and he says he\u2019s failed!\u201d).</p> <p>The problem they were facing was that their employer, BT Group, could not afford to pay the pensions it had promised both men when each joined the company, and it needed to come up with a fudge. Last week, after numerous stalled attempts, the plan&#xa0;arrived.</p> <p>The good news for Melvyn and Anthony is that about \u00a32bn of BT\u2019s cash, plus a further \u00a32bn raised from a bond and a decade\u2019s worth of \u00a3900m annual contributions, will now be stuffed into the pension fund, which is around \u00a311.3bn in deficit.</p> <p>The bad news is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/10/bt-to-axe-13000-jobs-and-move-out-of-london-hq\" title=\"\">this announcement was part of a wider modernisation package</a> that will see about 13,000 staff lose their jobs \u2013 which, considering their ages, is probably worse news for the younger Anthony than the more mature Melvyn.</p> <p>Quite how we all afford the dotages we have come to expect is a worry for many more families than the fictional Bellmans, and the BT announcement is a reminder of how few perfect solutions there are in this sphere.</p> <p>Companies must fund the retirement pledges made to their employees. They also need to pay dividends to the City so that different pension schemes can operate effectively for other workers. Simultaneously, firms must invest in their businesses and provide jobs for staff like Anthony, who, judging from his history, might not relish a return to school to retrain.</p> <p>You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that this system is destroying itself, to borrow from Marx (in a shocking departure for this column, that\u2019s Karl, not Groucho). And precisely that quandary will emerge again this week, when another former state monopoly, Royal Mail, announces its results.</p> <p>Like BT, Royal Mail is also trying to rework what it fears will become company-crushing pension commitments \u2013 but in a far more original&#xa0;way.Typically, there are two types of pension scheme: the traditional defined-benefit scheme, where you get a set pension, which companies complain is unaffordable; or, the more modern defined-contribution scheme, where your pension depends on how much is in your personal pot, and which workers complain make retirements unaffordable.</p> <p>The twist with Royal Mail is that it has agreed with the Communications Workers Union to offer a hybrid solution \u2013 a so-called collective defined contribution (CDC) scheme where the fund aims for, rather than promises, a certain payout.</p> <p>The idea is that all employees pay into a collective fund (like defined-benefit) and not a personal pot (as in defined-contribution). Investment returns can then be enhanced for everyone, as fund managers do not have to hedge bets as each person nears retirement. Meanwhile, employers reckon it\u2019s more affordable because the firm is not on the hook for a set payout, as it is in defined-benefit.</p> <p>At least, that\u2019s the theory. CDC schemes don\u2019t exist at all in this country and the law would need to be changed to allow them. Meanwhile, even Royal Mail admits that there isn\u2019t much anywhere else in the world that is comparable. So will this work?</p> <p>To answer that, you might need to ask somebody so bright, and with such foresight, that they have gained an exam pass in an \u201cology\u201d.</p> <p>Astrology, that is.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney is not so much an unreliable boyfriend as a schoolboy who keeps getting his homework wrong. The Bank of England governor gave his quarterly review of the economy last week and yet again confounded earlier expectations that he would increase the cost of borrowing. Whereas in the past Carney has confidently predicted that the economy is robust and capable of absorbing increases in interest rates, only to find plausible excuses for not going ahead, this time he was unable to offer any coherent defence. At the press conference held following the Bank\u2019s quarterly inflation report, Carney was challenged by journalists again and again that his answers failed to add up. He became irritable and on occasion abrupt with his interrogators. His counterpart at the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, has a similar reputation for spiky relationships, especially with the press. But his excuse for never raising interest rates is consistent. He avoids the trap of exuberance based on a few months of good economic news, unlike Carney. It means Draghi has rarely made the mistake of leading consumers, mortgage payers and the financial markets to believe the cost of borrowing will rise imminently when in the end it does not. Carney tells us time and again that things are about to get better and that the end of easy money must accompany this improvement. The question is, will anyone believe him again when he says interest rates are about to rise? The Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee, of which Carney is chair, always has a good excuse for another delay. It said the bad economic news in the first few months of the year was just a blip and once normal service is resumed, rate rises will begin to kick in. Yet to anyone outside the Bank, the downward trend is clear. The economy is slowing and to an alarming degree. Ever since the Brexit vote the housing market has deflated. The number of transactions has fallen and prices growth stalled. It is a market held up by government subsidy in the shape of George Osborne\u2019s Help to Buy scheme, and now even that is not enough to propel it forward. The Halifax has reported a decline of 3.2% between January and March, the steepest fall in nine years. The lack of action in the mortgage market is reflected in the credit markets, which have shown a major squeeze on the growth in secured and unsecured borrowing. It seems that fewer and fewer people each month want to borrow to spend and invest. This might not matter if pay growth was about to take off. That it will take off has been the Bank\u2019s central projection since the beginning of the decade. But it has never happened. Carney said low unemployment and a high number of job vacancies meant an uplift in wage growth was still imminent. Over at the Office for National Statistics, the measure of average weekly wages points in a different direction. It shows weekly incomes have fallen in every month since October 2017 to hit \u00a3486. This compares with an average wage (in 2015 prices) that reached a high point of \u00a3522.50 a week in 2008. In April last year the average was \u00a38 higher than today at \u00a3494. Wages are a crucial element of household spending power. The other is credit. If both are going down or growth is falling, the economy has a problem; it\u2019s not a blip. Inequality, not merit, is behind soaring art valuations While sitting in the back of a car, Damien Hirst scribbled a sketch of a shark and handed it to his driver as a tip for a smooth journey. The chauffeur later sold the piece, which had taken the enfant terrible of British art about 30 seconds to draw, for \u00a34,500. The anecdote reflects well on Hirst\u2019s generosity, but portrays the wealthy art-buying community in a less flattering light. And that group of rich aesthetes is having a busy fortnight. Last week the private art collection of David Rockefeller was sold off, fetching multimillion-dollar prices including $115m for Picasso\u2019s Fillette \u00e0 la corbeille fleurie (Young Girl with a Flower Basket). On Monday, Nu couch\u00e9 (Reclining Nude) by Amedeo Modigliani goes up for sale at Sotheby\u2019s in New York with a valuation of at least $150m. Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World) went on sale with an estimated value of $100m last year before it was sold for a record $450m, so the Modigliani valuation could be conservative. If the price of art is driven by a combination of aesthetic merit and scarcity, Hirst\u2019s dashed-off piece doesn\u2019t pass the test. The sale of a Modigliani or a Leonardo at least meets those requirements. But what links all three pieces, and raises wider questions about the art market, is wealth. There is a significant number of people ready to waste their capital on objects that, in a world with more equally distributed wealth, would never achieve those valuations. Roman Abramovich, who made his fortune buying Russian state assets on the cheap, spent tens of millions on a pair of paintings by Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon, while Steve Cohen, the billionaire hedge fund owner whose SAC fund pleaded guilty to insider trading in 2013, paid $165m for Masterpiece by Roy Lichtenstein. The art market is not an arbiter of taste. It is a symbol of inequality. We can\u2019t have a sensible debate on train tickets without mentioning their prices The key words in the rail industry\u2019s announcement of a review of fares regulation last week were \u201crevenue neutral\u201d. In other words, the \u00a39.7bn a year that passengers spend on tickets will not be reduced \u2013 or increased. Some of the points raised in the statement by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), formed by train operators and Network Rail, are sensible: that seven-day season tickets do not reflect the realities of flexible working (and, implicitly, a three- or four-day-a-week season ticket would be better); that multiple single fares are often cheaper than a single through ticket; and that the amount of fares available on the rail system \u2013 a boggling 55 million \u2013 is too many. But failure to address the average price of tickets \u2013 whether allowing that price to fall to encourage more rail journeys, or actually raising prices in order to pay for, say, new lines and trains \u2013 leaves the impression of an incomplete review. As the RDG admits, the funding balance between the fare payers and taxpayers \u2013 the latter paid a net \u00a33.4bn into the railways last year \u2013 will not be scrutinised because \u201cthis choice is rightly a matter for governments\u201d. Whether total fare revenues rise or fall should be a matter for voters and their representatives, but that should not dissuade train operators and Network Rail from offering its informed opinion on whether the railways require greater investment and who should pay for it. So far, the nation\u2019s balance sheet has done the heavy lifting. At \u00a346bn and rising, Network Rail\u2019s debt is too large. Relentlessly raising fare revenue \u2013 up 18% over five years \u2013 while pushing down the taxpayer contribution \u2013 down 21% over the same period \u2013 seems an unjust balance given the public, social and environmental good that railways represent. Let\u2019s have a sensible, open debate about it.",
