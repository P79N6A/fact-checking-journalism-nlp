      "bodyText": "Hurrah, the UK will embark on its post-Brexit adventure with an industrial strategy, or at least a government that is prepared to use the term without embarrassment. What\u2019s more, the business secretary, Greg Clark, hit some of the right notes in his introduction to the green paper. The goal is not to pick winners, which would be to repeat the mistakes of the 1970s. Nor is it to protect the position of incumbents. It\u2019s about \u201ccreating the right conditions for new and growing enterprises to thrive\u201d. Few could disagree with the sentiment, or the eagerness to see the benefits of self-improvement spread more evenly across the nation. Jolly good, but defining the ambition and describing past errors is the easy bit. It would be hard to conclude that the government\u2019s thinking amounts to a clear-headed plan that is ready to be put into action. Many tough decisions were ducked in the green paper, or left hanging in the air. Should the steel industry celebrate a \u201cstrategic approach\u201d to procurement? Talk of mimicking Crossrail\u2019s consideration of \u201csocial and economic factors\u201d could suggest that British steel will be preferred in mega-projects like HS2. But the document didn\u2019t say so explicitly. Many of the passages on procurements were about stirring innovation and encouraging small businesses. Steel may not be as exciting as life sciences and clean cars, but is it inside or outside the strategic tent? The UK Steel lobbying group was right to reflect that \u201cmuch still needs to be done\u201d to agree one of the vaunted \u201csector deals\u201d with government. Or look at digital infrastructure, where the UK is ahead of major competitors on fast broadband but woefully behind the likes of Spain, South Korea and even Turkey on ultrafast capacity, the digital-to-the-premises (DTTP) variety. Does Clark agree with Vodafone that BT\u2019s performance in delivering DTTP is \u201ca national embarrassment\u201d? Or does he think regulator Ofcom\u2019s attempt to stir investment by opening up access to BT\u2019s ducts and poles will suffice? Those questions lie at the heart of one critical debate about the UK\u2019s digital future, but it\u2019s not addressed. Instead, as in many areas, the green paper merely repeated commitments that have been made already \u2013 in this case the \u00a3740m going to support the roll-out of fibre broadband and 5G mobile technology. One suspects a serious government-backed commitment to DTTP would be counted in the billions or involve breaking up BT. In other words, the subject is too tricky for this document. Some industrialists will find to much to cheer, notably the emphasis on reducing energy costs (though it remains a mystery how that squares with the grotesquely expensive Hinkley Point C nuclear power station). Overall, though, one is left with a sense that the green paper amounts to a long list of good intentions without a clear sense of which should be preferred in a world of finite financial resources. Are we going down the American route (led by procurement and universities) or the German (with its emphasis on research and development) or the French (build some grands projets)? There were elements of all three. That may be a good thing, or it may be a muddle. The white paper needs to be sharper. Sainsbury\u2019s should take the heat over boss\u2019s barn If you were a shareholder in a FTSE 100 company, would you expect to be told that your chairman had been censured by the board after an internal investigation? Would you want to know there had been \u201cmaterial breaches\u201d of policies covering conflicts of interest? The answer to both questions is surely yes. The chairman is supposed to be a guardian of good behaviour. If he or she has messed up \u2013 intentionally or not \u2013 it\u2019s important to say. The tale of David Tyler, the Sainsbury\u2019s chairman, and his barn conversion was told in Monday\u2019s paper. In short: Tyler used one of Sainsbury\u2019s green energy and engineering experts to inspect his plans to install underfloor heating at his home in East Sussex. One of the supermarket group\u2019s building contractors then developed an action plan for free; and two other Sainsbury\u2019s suppliers were contacted for specialist advice. Tyler then contacted Sainsbury\u2019s company secretary to arrange compensation for use of employees\u2019 time. He ended up paying \u00a35,000 to charity and did not benefit financially. But the resulting investigation, conducted by two non-executive directors, concluded that \u201che received (paid for) services from an expert supplier due to his position that he would otherwise not have been able to\u201d. Thus the official warning. It\u2019s not the biggest scandal in the world, and Tyler\u2019s failure to follow the rules was accepted as unintentional. But the intriguing detail is that it all happened in 2013. Sainsbury\u2019s didn\u2019t think it worth mentioning to shareholders, even in the years when its annual report scrupulously addressed the motor-racing sponsorship deals that some suppliers gave to the son of Justin King, chief executive at the time. That looks like double standards. Better late than never, Sainsbury\u2019s could correct its oversight in this year\u2019s annual report, lest anyone should think the publication, like Tyler\u2019s country pad, is full of hot air.",

      "bodyText": "Two brothers who trafficked vulnerable men from Poland to work in a Sports Direct warehouse have been jailed for six years each under the Modern Slavery Act. Erwin Markowski, 38, and his brother Krystian, 35, lured 18 men from Poland to work at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse, Nottingham crown court heard. Poor working conditions at the factory, including body searches and pay below the legal minimum were exposed by an undercover Guardian investigation in 2015. The duo employed a \u201cspotter\u201d in Poland to identify vulnerable people who could be sent to the UK on the promise of work. When the men arrived, the Markowski brothers opened bank accounts on their behalf and withdrew most of their income from working at Shirebrook. The workers, who had their passports taken from them, were left with about \u00a390 from weekly takehome pay that should have been \u00a3265, the court heard. The brothers, who made \u00a335,000 from the scheme, were caught after one of the victims tipped off police, triggering a raid on a home in the city. The victim said he had been living in the house with 10 other men, who were also working at Sports Direct. Judge Steven Coupland said the men were \u201cfilled with false promises of a good life in the UK where they would be assisted [...] to receive a decent job, pay and decent accommodation\u201d. He said the arrangement \u201cbecame a planned and systematic scheme to traffic human beings into the UK in order for you to control them and benefit from their hard work, making substantial sums of money, living in good conditions while they received very little and lived in poorer conditions\u201d. DC Sarah Fearn of Nottinghamshire police said victims were left feeling \u201cused, distressed and manipulated\u201d. A spokesperson for Sports Direct said: \u201cWe welcome the conviction of these two individuals, who were brought to justice after being reported to police by the Transline agency and Sports Direct in February 2016. It sends a clear message that we will not tolerate these kinds of behaviour.\u201d The men were sent to Shirebrook via Transline, an outsourcing group that supplied agency staff to Sports Direct. A spokesperson for Transline said: \u201cThese two brothers have no association to Transline,\u201d adding that the firm had reported complaints of exploitation related to the case to the police. \u201cWe have stringent and thorough checks in place on identities and bank and payment details to prevent this type of criminal activity, and find any instances deplorable and cruel.\u201d But Britain\u2019s biggest trade union, Unite, called for an investigation into the employment firm. The Unite assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said: \u201cThe behaviour and the misery meted out by the Markowski brothers on vulnerable workers would shame a Dickens novel. It is all the more shocking that it took place in 21st-century Britain in the warehouse of a high street retailer. \u201cThere now needs to by a full scale investigation into Transline\u2019s behaviour and employment practices.\u201d The Markowski brothers admitted one charge of conspiracy to arrange or facilitate travel with a view to exploitation, an offence under the Modern Slavery Act. They were also sentenced to two years and six months for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation, an offence under the Fraud Act.",

      "bodyText": "Investors were cautious as Donald Trump made a number of moves in his first day in office as US president, including plans to renegotiate the free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico and withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He also threatened massive border taxes on companies moving abroad and shipping goods to the US. With the dollar weakening on nervousness about Trump\u2019s protectionism and fears of a trade war, European markets were on the back foot, while Wall Street also went into decline. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: European stocks dropped whilst Wall Street opened lower on the first full working day with Donald Trump as US President. Attempts to breakout into new highs for the year have been temporarily shelved after Donald Trump opted for a protectionist, anti-establishment inauguration address. The tone at the inauguration was very different to the acceptance speech that preceded the latest rally in equities and the US dollar. Perhaps the market was a little overdone to the upside anyway, but it isn\u2019t hard to imagine a more positive reaction should the speech have been more conciliatory. Still, there is no clear sense of capitulation in markets yet. Investors are still willing to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt. A little protectionism can be tolerated if it comes with lower taxes and lighter-touch regulation. In a series of statements on Monday, Trump generated mixed feelings about the direction of future policy. The new US President said he believes he can \u201ccut regulations by 75%\u201d, \u201ccut taxes massively\u201d for the middle class while imposing a \u201cvery major border tax\u201d. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 47.26 points or 0.66% at 7151.18 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.73% to 11,545.75 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.6% at 4821.41 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 60 points or 0.31% at 19,767. The 20,000 level, within tantalising reach just a couple of weeks ago, is receding fast. Meanwhile the pound is up 0.8% against a weakening dollar at $1.2476, still at a five week high. The prospect of the UK government losing the Supreme Court case on Brexit, with judgement due on Tuesday, is also giving some support to sterling. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The weakness in the dollar and hopes that Donald Trump\u2019s infrastructure plans will boost demand are helping to buoy up metal prices, with copper up 0.8% on the London Metal Exchange. In turn that has lifted mining groups, with Antofagasta rising up nearly 4% and Anglo American adding 1.5%. Precious metal miners such as Randgold Resources and Fresnillo are also in demand as investors seek havens amid the uncertainty over Trump\u2019s presidency. The US is set to renogiate the free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, and our latest report is here: US markets could be set for further falls as the initial Trump boost fades and a possible recession looms, reckons Capital Economics. The consultancy\u2019s John Higgins said: We think that the S&amp;P 500 will only rise a little bit further over the next couple of years and then probably tumble as the US economy takes a turn for the worse. Admittedly, Trump\u2019s election victory gave the index some renewed impetus. But the euphoria has died down and it is now not much higher than at the start of 2017. Indeed, the big picture is that since trebling between its post-financial crisis trough in 2009 and the end of 2014, the S&amp;P 500 has traded in a fairly narrow range. We doubt that this pattern is set to change in the first couple of years of Trump\u2019s presidency. Indeed, we forecast that the index will end this year and next at 2,300 and 2,400, respectively, which would be small gains from its current level of around 2,270. Our caution is related to the stage of the economic cycle. We have reached a point where the unemployment rate in the US is close to its \u201cnatural\u201d level. If, as we suspect, the rate falls below this level in the early part of Trump\u2019s presidency, the likely outcome is a squeeze on domestic profits as workers benefit from higher wages. Ongoing share count dilution (via buy-backs) and faster growth in profits from the rest of the world could conceivably take up some of the slack. But the latter seems doubtful if, as we anticipate, the dollar strengthens further in response to tighter-than-expected Fed policy. What\u2019s more, investors are unlikely to drive the valuation of the stock market up to an even higher level. In the past, the price/earnings multiple of the S&amp;P 500 has tended to track a sideways path when the unemployment rate has fallen well below its natural level. As a result, the S&amp;P 500 has only tended to edge up on the eight occasions since 1950 when this has happened. The average gain in the index has been roughly 4% a year, about half its average over the period. Things are likely to get bleaker for investors as the second half of Trump\u2019s first term as president comes around. The boost to economic growth from fiscal stimulus is likely to have faded by that point and monetary policy is likely to be a lot tighter than it is now. The risk of a recession will therefore be high. Major corrections in the stock markets often occur about three to six months before the onset of an economic downturn. The upshot is that we think that the next big move in the S&amp;P 500 will be down, perhaps in 2019. A fall of 20% or more seems plausible, especially as the valuation of the index is on the high side. On Wall Street the slide in the Dow Jones Industrial Average has accelerated as investors continue to express concern about the protectionist policies promoted by the new US president. Donald Trump\u2019s meeting with US chief executives seems to have emphasised these worries. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Donald Trump has wasted little time in his new role, choosing to host on open meeting with business leaders in front of the press. This meeting was clearly as much about the message it sends out to other businesses as it was about the CEOs in the room. Trump\u2019s promise of lower taxes and better incentives for firms to remain in the US should have provided a boost for US stocks, yet with the likes of the Dow trading in the red, it is clear that markets instead focused on the protectionist aspects of the new president\u2019s plans. Trump\u2019s promise for massive import taxes on products produced abroad and shipped to the US strikes a dangerous tone, threatening to spark a trade war, hard on the heels of the currency wars of the past few years. If today teaches us anything, it is that Trump shows little signs of slowing down, with the next four years promising to be hugely unpredictable for traders who deal with US securities. Given today\u2019s 45 day low for the dollar index, it seems the Trump boost seems to have run its course, for now. The Dow is currently down 75 points or 0.38%. Still with the confidence figures, ING economist Bert Colijn said: Improvements in the job market seem to be outweighing concerns about political volatility among consumers for the moment. Expectations of unemployment have declined significantly over recent months and expectations of the financial situation of households have improved. While 2017 could be a year full of political risk, consumers have started it full of confidence. This is a positive sign for domestic demand growth in the first quarter, which is why we expect consumer spending to accelerate in the first quarter of 2017. Consumers do seem to be defying some of the more negative factors influencing confidence. Besides continued high political risk, this month gasoline prices reached the highest level since August 2015, which shows that the oil price recovery continues to work through to the headline inflation numbers in January. Eurozone stock prices have also stagnated at the beginning of the year, as the Trump-rally calmed ahead of the inauguration. Higher inflation and concerns about geopolitics could impact confidence later in the quarter as gasoline prices rise further and major Europeans elections come closer, but for now consumers remain optimistic. The European consumer confidence figures are encouraging but the outlook may not be so positive, says Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Markit. He said: First survey evidence for 2017 for the Eurozone economy is encouraging \u2013 as consumer confidence rose for a fifth month running in January to reach a 21-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now substantially along long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone currently seeming to be focusing on recent largely decent economic news and improved job markets; and, for now at least, brushing off political uncertainties. January\u2019s further strengthening in consumer confidence buoys hopes that the Eurozone economy can get off to a decent start to 2017 after seemingly improving in the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe that Eurozone GDP growth picked up to at least 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016, and could very well have reached 0.5% quarter-on-quarter. This would be up from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in both the third and second quarters. However, the fundamentals for Eurozone consumers could well soften overall during the coming months \u2013 particularly through higher inflation eating into purchasing power. Much will likely depend on how well Eurozone labour markets do over the coming months. Furthermore, it remains highly possible that consumer confidence in the Eurozone will be increasingly pressurized by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months. 2017 will see general elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands, likely political problems in Italy and Spain, and the United Kingdom formally launching the process of leaving the European Union. The UK\u2019s Brexit vote last June and November\u2019s election of Donald Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks in the Eurozone. Over in Europe, consumer confidence improved in January to a 21 month high, but not by as much as expected. According to the European Commission, consumer confidence in the eurozone rose by 0.2 points to -4.9, compared to expectations of a figure of -4.8. In the wider European Union it improved 0.3 points to -4.3 from December. With the concerns about Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist strategy heightened by the new President\u2019s inauguration speech hitting the dollar and prompting investors to seek havens, US markets have edged lower at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 13 points or 0.06% while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.17% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.145. Meanwhile Trump has been telling a number of US chief executives that companies will get fast approval to build in the US, but those that move abroad will face major border taxes on goods coming into the US. The UK Supreme Court is due to make its decision on Tuesday on whether MPs are entitled to have a vote on triggering Article 50, the process of leaving the EU. Whichever way the ruling goes, the pound and the markets are bound to be affected. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, said: Ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Supreme Court\u2019s decision, both FTSE and sterling are the major focus for investors. If the Supreme court provides a decision which is against the government\u2019s unilateral power (triggering the article 50), we could see sterling moving higher. The reason will be that parliament will have much more to say in triggering Article 50 and most importantly, it fades the chances of Scotland prompting another referendum. Scotland can no longer play the card that the Brexit is against their will if the vote comes to the parliament. As for the FTSE, higher sterling could take some more wind out of the index. On the flip side, if the Supreme court says that Theresa May does have a unilateral decision in activating article 50, we could see the sterling falling. Traders will perceive that Theresa May is going to achieve her \u201cclean\u201d Brexit without major hurdles. For the FTSE 100, lower sterling has provided ammunition for higher moves. Time for a quick catch-up, and the latest reaction to today\u2019s developments. Worries over Donald Trump\u2019s early moves as president are driving the markets today, weakening the US dollar as investors fret about a new wave of protectionism. The pound has hit its highest level since mid-December, currently up almost one cent at $1.246. The euro has also crept higher, to $1.0735, as the US currency fell on the FX markets. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga blames uncertainty for the moves. Global stocks traded lower on Monday as the Trump fueled uncertainties, rising political risks, and overall market jitters dented investors risk appetite. Asian shares failed to maintain gains while the risk-off sentiment sent European markets into the red territory. Fears that the new US president could spark trade wars with China, or with countries close to home, have dominated today. These concerns got another bump after US media reported that Trump will sign an executive order today to start the renegotiation of NAFTA. Analysts at Dutch bank ING explain why traders are edgy: While President Trump\u2019s \u2018too strong\u2019 dollar comment and combative inaugural address has taken some of the steam out of the greenback\u2019s rally, we remain wary that dollar strength could be the ultimate by-product of the new President\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 policy stance. Indeed, the updated White House pages show that 25 million new jobs and 4% GDP growth remain the economic pledges of the Trump administration. With a US economy already close to full employment, it is difficult not to see Trump\u2019s fiscal plans generating sufficient inflationary pressures to drive US yields and the dollar higher. But equally, investors are placing greater focus on future US trade and foreign policy. Naturally the market may be bracing itself for President Trump to formally name China a currency manipulator. In practice, this would spark bilateral negotiations rather than any immediate tariffs but presumably the market wouldn\u2019t take too kindly to this. That has weighed on the London stock market; the FTSE 100 is currently down 42 points at 7156, meaning its early 2017 gains have been wiped out. The City\u2019s new year optimism has rather fizzled out, as Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: Having hit a fresh all-time high this time last Monday, an aggressively negative series of sessions last week, largely inspired by the pound\u2019s gains following Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speeches, has effectively wiped away the remarkable gains it managed in the first fortnight of 2017. The FTSE still has a way to go before it dips under the key 7000 level; however, the index\u2019s rampant optimism does seem to have come to an end in conjunction with the pound beginning to peek its head above the parapet after a month or so of suffering. Trump anxiety, and the weak dollar, also helped to push the gold price up to a two-month high, as part of a general move to safer assets. US media are reporting that Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order today that would start the process of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (the free trade bloc of the US, Canada and Mexico). This shouldn\u2019t come as a shock to those paying attention to the US election, as Paul McNamara of investment group GAM points out: Meanwhile in Europe, protesting farmers have been spraying powdered milk at the EU council headquarters in Brussels. The demonstration, organised by the European Milk Board, is meant to put pressure on ministers to help support milk powder prices. According to news service Agriland, the farmers want the EU to agree not to release stocks from the EU\u2019s milk powder mountain. That would allow them to cut production and push up prices. The EMB says: \u201cThe dairy market is still stuck in a crisis. Voluntary production cuts might have led to a rise in prices, but the sale of milk powder from EU intervention stocks would, once again, put the market under pressure.\u201d \u201cWe need a permanent crisis instrument that prevents surpluses on the dairy market and leads to long-term stability,\u201d according to the board. AFP\u2019s Marine Laouchez of AFP filmed a videoclip of the protests: Newsflash: Mario Draghi is now collecting the 2016 Camillo Cavour prize, awarded for his work strengthening Italy. And the ECB president is talking about the instability currently in play in Italy and beyond, as he compares the situation today to the mid-19th century, when Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, helped unify Italy. His speech is on the ECB website, in Italian -- here\u2019s what Google Translate makes of it.... Cavour acted in a European context suddenly destabilized by the 1848 revolutions that had disrupted the balance of power established by the Congress of Vienna after the fall of Napoleon. It was a period of turbulent transition, in which for the protagonists of European politics opened large joint opportunities to large risks. Today we are again in a historical phase in which Europe is moving, after the dissolution of the Soviet bloc, the reunification of Germany, the effects of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, the UK via exit \u2018 European Union, the geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe. In different words, now as then we could say that it is looking for a new stability. ECB president Mario Draghi has just been sighted in Turin, where he\u2019ll be giving a speech at a prize-giving ceremony (in memory of Italian statesman Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour) We\u2019ll watch out for any monetary policy signals from Draghi (who left interest rates unchanged last week) The eurozone\u2019s total national debt has shrunk to its smallest level in four years, when measured against its total economy. New figures from Eurostat show that the euro area national debt dropped to 90.1% of GDP in the July-September 2016 quarter, almost a whole percentage point lower than the previous three months. That means that Europe\u2019s economy has been growing at a slightly faster rate than its borrowing has expanded: Today\u2019s selloff means the FTSE 100 has lost virtually all the gains it made this year. The rally that began after the shock US election result in early November appears to have petered out, as investors face the reality of a Trump presidency. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says there is a gloomy mood in the markets, with the FTSE 100 currently down 41 points at 7156. The week has started on a bearish note, with the FTSE 100 falling over 40 points in early trading. The index has lost around 3% since its peak earlier in January, although it has held the breakout line of 7130 that marked its previous high. The steady deterioration in risk appetite over the past few days nicely bookends the post-election period, which began with such furious buying of stocks. Disappointment has set in, but it has not yet turned to disillusionment. This chart, from the Wall Street Journal, show how market volatility has risen while money flowed out of the markets last week: City investors are disappointed that Trump\u2019s inauguration speech contained little detail on fiscal policy, tax cuts and infrastructure spending. As Kit Juckes of French Bank Societe Generale puts it: Instead, the message was combative, protectionist and isolationist, while the media focus was on the size of crowds and the women\u2019s movement marches in the US and elsewhere. Here\u2019s our take on Crowdgate: London\u2019s stock market has opened in the red. The FTSE 100 has dropped by 64 points, or 0.9%, to 7134 points. That\u2019s partly due to the strength of the pound (which will hurt exporters, and make UK shares more expensive for foreign investors to buy). Financial stocks are leading the selloff, with Admiral Group down 2.5%, RBS down 2.2% and Barclays losing 2%. Other European markets are also falling, with anxiety over Trump to the fore. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the markets are being driven by the weaker dollar this morning. So far the new president has stoked protectionism but offered little detail on the good stuff \u2013 pro-growth infrastructure spending, stimulus etc. That\u2019s ensuring the dollar starts the week on the back foot, trading at its weakest since early December. Gold is trading at a two-month high as safe haven assets are bid. We\u2019ll be looking for more details on spending and growth plans in the coming days, which could revive the long dollar trade. The dollar is down 0.5% against other currencies this morning. RBC Capital Markets blame: ...the lack of economic policy detail in President Trump\u2019s inauguration speech coupled with concerns over his potential protectionist stance. Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric is driving down the US dollar this morning. The greenback is in retreat against most major currencies, sending the British pound up 0.75 of a cent to $1.245. That\u2019s its highest level since 19 December. Ilya Spivak of Daily FX reports that traders are anxious, piling into US debt and the Japanese yen, and gold of course. The euro is also gaining ground, up 0.35% at $1.074 this morning. Trump\u2019s unpopularity, unpredictability and unyielding determination to put US interests first are all worrying for traders, who have the unenviable task of trying to guess his next move. Kathleen Brooks of City Index say investors will be watching Trump\u2019s first week as president closely: After the \u201cjoyless rant\u201d of Trump\u2019s inauguration speech on Friday (to paraphrase Simon Schama, writing in the FT at the weekend), the world is watching to see what will be included in the rush of executive orders that are forecast to come in the coming days. This will hopefully give us an idea if Trump has a coherent set of views that could be considered a plausible economic policy. If his team use \u201calternative facts\u201d about the size of the much-anticipated infrastructure spending programme, for instance, or if he walks away from rolling back years of financial market regulation, two key drivers of the stock market rally since Trump\u2019s election in November, then the stock market rally could whither and die. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The markets are starting the week in a nervous mood, as Donald Trump gets his feet under the Oval Office desk. Gold has hit a two-month high in early trading, with investors anxious about the new president\u2019s combative inauguration speech on Friday. Trump\u2019s vow to put America First means more worries about protectionism, and potential trade wars. Bullion is changing hands at $1,217 per ounce, the highest since late November, in a sign that investors are looking for safe assets. Many City experts are predicting that trading will be edgy in the next few months, as Reuters explains: With the lack of a clear policy direction from Trump, the market movement is a sign that risk aversion is back on the table, OCBC analyst Barnabas Gan said. The market could witness volatility into the first 100 days of the Trump administration, he added. Shares in Europe are expected to drop too, as local currencies gain against the US dollar. Also coming up The economic calendar is a little sparse today, but there are a few things to watch out for: 11.30am GMT: ECB President Mario Draghi will deliver a speech on the occasion of the awarding of the Premio Camillo Cavour organised by Fondazione Camillo Cavour in Turin 1.15pm GMT: ECB Board Member Peter Praet delivers a speech at \u201cEuropean Pillar of Social Rights Conference\u201d, in Brussels 3pm: The EC\u2019s monthly Eurozone consumer confidence survey",

He also threatened massive border taxes on companies moving abroad and shipping goods to the US. With the dollar weakening on nervousness about Trump\u2019s protectionism and fears of a trade war, European markets were on the back foot, while Wall Street also went into decline. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>European stocks dropped whilst Wall Street opened lower on the first full working day with Donald Trump as US President. Attempts to breakout into new highs for the year have been temporarily shelved after Donald Trump opted for a protectionist, anti-establishment inauguration address. The tone at the inauguration was very different to the acceptance speech that preceded the latest rally in equities and the US dollar.</p> <p>Perhaps the market was a little overdone to the upside anyway, but it isn\u2019t hard to imagine a more positive reaction should the speech have been more conciliatory. Still, there is no clear sense of capitulation in markets yet. Investors are still willing to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt. </p> <p>A little protectionism can be tolerated if it comes with lower taxes and lighter-touch regulation. In a series of statements on Monday, Trump generated mixed feelings about the direction of future policy. The new US President said he believes he can \u201ccut regulations by 75%\u201d, \u201ccut taxes massively\u201d for the middle class while imposing a \u201cvery major border tax\u201d. </p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished down 47.26 points or 0.66% at 7151.18</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.73% to 11,545.75</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.6% at 4821.41</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 60 points or 0.31% at 19,767.

The consultancy\u2019s John Higgins said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think that the S&amp;P 500 will only rise a little bit further over the next couple of years and then probably tumble as the US economy takes a turn for the worse.</p> <p>Admittedly, Trump\u2019s election victory gave the index some renewed impetus. But the euphoria has died down and it is now not much higher than at the start of 2017. Indeed, the big picture is that since trebling between its post-financial crisis trough in 2009 and the end of 2014, the S&amp;P 500 has traded in a fairly narrow range.</p> <p>We doubt that this pattern is set to change in the first couple of years of Trump\u2019s presidency. Indeed, we forecast that the index will end this year and next at 2,300 and 2,400, respectively, which would be small gains from its current level of around 2,270.</p> <p>Our caution is related to the stage of the economic cycle. We have reached a point where the unemployment rate in the US is close to its \u201cnatural\u201d level. If, as we suspect, the rate falls below this level in the early part of Trump\u2019s presidency, the likely outcome is a squeeze on domestic profits as workers benefit from higher wages. Ongoing share count dilution (via buy-backs) and faster growth in profits from the rest of the world could conceivably take up some of the slack. But the latter seems doubtful if, as we anticipate, the dollar strengthens further in response to tighter-than-expected Fed policy.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ccc6b7aedcf04030e6b03b203911814323974dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ccc6b7aedcf04030e6b03b203911814323974dd/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders at the New York Stock Exchange\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders at the New York Stock Exchange</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>What\u2019s more, investors are unlikely to drive the valuation of the stock market up to an even higher level. In the past, the price/earnings multiple of the S&amp;P 500 has tended to track a sideways path when the unemployment rate has fallen well below its natural level.</p> <p>As a result, the S&amp;P 500 has only tended to edge up on the eight occasions since 1950 when this has happened. The average gain in the index has been roughly 4% a year, about half its average over the period.</p> <p>Things are likely to get bleaker for investors as the second half of Trump\u2019s first term as president comes around. The boost to economic growth from fiscal stimulus is likely to have faded by that point and monetary policy is likely to be a lot tighter than it is now. The risk of a recession will therefore be high.</p> <p>Major corrections in the stock markets often occur about three to six months before the onset of an economic downturn. The upshot is that we think that the next big move in the S&amp;P 500 will be down, perhaps in 2019. A fall of 20% or more seems plausible, especially as the valuation of the index is on the high side.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58862c63e4b0b7484e0a3025\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-23T16:19:00.233Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>On Wall Street the slide in the Dow Jones Industrial Average has accelerated as investors continue to express concern about the protectionist policies promoted by the new US president.</strong></p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s meeting with US chief executives seems to have emphasised these worries. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Donald Trump has wasted little time in his new role, choosing to host on open meeting with business leaders in front of the press. This meeting was clearly as much about the message it sends out to other businesses as it was about the CEOs in the room.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s promise of lower taxes and better incentives for firms to remain in the US should have provided a boost for US stocks, yet with the likes of the Dow trading in the red, it is clear that markets instead focused on the protectionist aspects of the new president\u2019s plans. Trump\u2019s promise for massive import taxes on products produced abroad and shipped to the US strikes a dangerous tone, threatening to spark a trade war, hard on the heels of the currency wars of the past few years.</p> <p>If today teaches us anything, it is that Trump shows little signs of slowing down, with the next four years promising to be hugely unpredictable for traders who deal with US securities.

Expectations of unemployment have declined significantly over recent months and expectations of the financial situation of households have improved. While 2017 could be a year full of political risk, consumers have started it full of confidence. This is a positive sign for domestic demand growth in the first quarter, which is why we expect consumer spending to accelerate in the first quarter of 2017.</p> <p>Consumers do seem to be defying some of the more negative factors influencing confidence. Besides continued high political risk, this month gasoline prices reached the highest level since August 2015, which shows that the oil price recovery continues to work through to the headline inflation numbers in January. Eurozone stock prices have also stagnated at the beginning of the year, as the Trump-rally calmed ahead of the inauguration. Higher inflation and concerns about geopolitics could impact confidence later in the quarter as gasoline prices rise further and major Europeans elections come closer, but for now consumers remain optimistic.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58862117e4b0dd6f5509d3b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-23T15:34:03.171Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The European consumer confidence figures are encouraging but the outlook may not be so positive, says Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Markit. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First survey evidence for 2017 for the Eurozone economy is encouraging \u2013 as consumer confidence rose for a fifth month running in January to reach a 21-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now substantially along long-term norms.<em> </em>Consumers across the Eurozone currently seeming to be focusing on recent largely decent economic news and improved job markets; and, for now at least, brushing off political uncertainties.</p> <p>January\u2019s further strengthening in consumer confidence buoys hopes that the Eurozone economy can get off to a decent start to 2017 after seemingly improving in the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe that Eurozone GDP growth picked up to at least 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016, and could very well have reached 0.5% quarter-on-quarter. This would be up from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in both the third and second quarters.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"725354a58d109c8694cb514edff6887475fb1721\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/725354a58d109c8694cb514edff6887475fb1721/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"European consumer confidence improves\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European consumer confidence improves</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Peter/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>However, the fundamentals for Eurozone consumers could well soften overall during the coming months \u2013 particularly through higher inflation eating into purchasing power. </p> <p>Much will likely depend on how well Eurozone labour markets do over the coming months.</p> <p>Furthermore, it remains highly possible that consumer confidence in the Eurozone will be increasingly pressurized by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months. 2017 will see general elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands, likely political problems in Italy and Spain, and the United Kingdom formally launching the process of leaving the European Union.

The euro has also crept higher, to $1.0735, as the US currency fell on the FX markets.</p> <p><strong>FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga</strong> blames uncertainty for the moves.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Global stocks traded lower on Monday as the Trump fueled uncertainties, rising political risks, and overall market jitters dented investors risk appetite.</p> <p>Asian shares failed to maintain gains while the risk-off sentiment sent European markets into the red territory.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fears that the new US president could spark trade wars with China, or with countries close to home, have dominated today.</p> <p>These concerns got another bump after US media reported that Trump will sign an executive order today to start the renegotiation of NAFTA.</p> <p><strong>Analysts at Dutch bank ING</strong> explain why traders are edgy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While President Trump\u2019s \u2018too strong\u2019 dollar comment and combative inaugural address has taken some of the steam out of the greenback\u2019s rally, we remain wary that dollar strength could be the ultimate by-product of the new President\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 policy stance. Indeed, the updated White House pages show that 25 million new jobs and 4% GDP growth remain the economic pledges of the Trump administration. With a US economy already close to full employment, it is difficult not to see Trump\u2019s fiscal plans generating sufficient inflationary pressures to drive US yields and the dollar higher.<br></p> <p>But equally, investors are placing greater focus on future US trade and foreign policy. Naturally the market may be bracing itself for President Trump to formally name China a currency manipulator. In practice, this would spark bilateral negotiations rather than any immediate tariffs but presumably the market wouldn\u2019t take too kindly to this.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>That has weighed on the London stock market; the FTSE 100 is currently down 42 points at 7156, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/23/pound-hits-five-week-high-as-trump-fears-weaken-dollar-business-live?page=with:block-5885d914e4b00b8fc2ae40a4#block-5885d914e4b00b8fc2ae40a4\">meaning its early 2017 gains have been wiped out.</a></strong></p> <p>The City\u2019s new year optimism has rather fizzled out, as <strong>Conner Campbell </strong>of <strong>SpreadEx</strong> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having hit a fresh all-time high this time last Monday, an aggressively negative series of sessions last week, largely inspired by the pound\u2019s gains following Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speeches, has effectively wiped away the remarkable gains it managed in the first fortnight of 2017.</p> <p>The FTSE still has a way to go before it dips under the key 7000 level; however, the index\u2019s rampant optimism does seem to have come to an end in conjunction with the pound beginning to peek its head above the parapet after a month or so of suffering.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Trump anxiety, and the weak dollar, also helped to push the gold price up to a two-month high, as part of a general move to safer assets.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5885fcf2e4b00b8fc2ae4183\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-23T13:07:14.749Z\">1.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US media are reporting that Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order today that would start the process of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (the free trade bloc of the US, Canada and Mexico).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/823508989229023233\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Trump to sign orders as early as today to renegotiate NAFTA and pull out of TPP - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCNews\">@NBCNews</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wDzeDfOMZ0\">https://t.co/wDzeDfOMZ0</a></p>&mdash; CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/823508989229023233\">January 23, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>This shouldn\u2019t come as a shock to those paying attention to the US election, as Paul McNamara of investment group GAM points out:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/M_PaulMcNamara/status/823513842311426050\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump Executive Order to renegotiate NAFTA confuses investors who&#39;ve spent last year under a rock.</p>&mdash; Paul McNamara (@M_PaulMcNamara) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/M_PaulMcNamara/status/823513842311426050\">January 23, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5885f288e4b00b8fc2ae4143\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-23T12:32:57.757Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Meanwhile in Europe, protesting farmers have been spraying powdered milk at the EU council headquarters in Brussels.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e8af61ddd7de3a140fae5c20a0e7681a04389fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e8af61ddd7de3a140fae5c20a0e7681a04389fc/0_0_4096_2823/1000.jpg\" alt=\"EMB protest in Brusselsepa05744184 European Milk board (EMB) representatives spray milk powder in front of the EU Council headquarters, during an EU Agriculture Ministers Council meeting in Brussels, Belgium, 23 January 2017.

      "bodyText": "Some of the UK\u2019s most prolific and successful ticket touts appear to be rebranding their organisations as the industry braces for investigations by the competition watchdog and the taxman in the UK. Moves among touts to alter their public profiles follow increased scrutiny, including an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into whether they are breaking the law by failing to disclose their identity on ticket resale sites. HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) is also examining the industry after MPs on the Commons culture, media and sport select committee demanded an inquiry into touts\u2019 tax affairs. The glare of publicity has prompted a flurry of activity among the most powerful operators, who have developed a stranglehold on tickets for in-demand events, such as an upcoming tour by U2 and the hip-hop musical Hamilton. Andrew Newman, revealed as one of the UK\u2019s most successful touts in an investigation by the Observer, has since changed his company\u2019s name from Newman Corporation to North Financial Group (NFG) and has also deleted his Twitter account. Newman, who did not return requests for comment, recently posted accounts at Companies House showing that NFG had assets of \u00a31.6m in 2015, up from \u00a31.1m the previous year. It is not possible to tell how much profit Newman made because his company is still small enough to be exempt from filing detailed accounts. Peter Hunter, the man behind major touting firm Ticket Wiz, has also changed the name of his company, from Ticket Wiz to BZZ. The change took place on 21 December, two days after the CMA said it planned to investigate the secondary ticketing industry. The regulator is investigating allegations that touts are breaching consumer law by failing to provide their details when they sell a ticket on secondary websites such as Viagogo, StubHub, GetMeIn and Seatwave. Another of the UK\u2019s most successful touting firms is 1st Choice Tickets, now known as WRT Services. The change of name happened three weeks after MPs on the culture select committee promised an inquiry into ticket abuse and said they would ask HMRC to look into the industry. In some cases, touts have removed tickets from resale websites altogether after the sites published their details in an attempt to show they are complying with consumer law. One company, Tickets2Go2, listed 96 tickets for Take That\u2019s upcoming tour on resale site GetMeIn for a combined \u00a359,000, compared with their face value of \u00a36,240. Shortly after the Guardian contacted GetMeIn, owned by Ticketmaster, the company\u2019s tickets were removed from the website. The owner of Tickets2Go2, Kent-based Aaron Colbourne, did not return requests for comment. In some cases, touts have responded to increased attention by listing their company information and contact details alongside tickets. But none who were contacted by the Guardian agreed to discuss the touting industry on the record. One tout, who asked not to be named, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I\u2019m supplying something people can\u2019t go without like housing or food. It\u2019s just entertainment put on for commercial gain.\u201d When the CMA launched its inquiry, it said that three out of four resale sites were now complying with the requirement to publish sellers\u2019 information. But research by the Guardian shows that in many cases the information is incomplete or inaccurate. More than 20 tickets for a U2 concert at Twickenham stadium this summer are listed on StubHub for a combined \u00a37,500 but the name of the firm selling the ticket is not revealed. However, the London address used is the same as that of Double 8 Tickets, a website currently offering U2 tickets and owned by Raymond Sullivan. He did not respond to a request for comment. In other cases, tickets are advertised as being sold by companies that are not registered at Companies House, or listed with a non-existent VAT number. Many touts simply do not publish any of their details at all on secondary websites, despite consumer laws requiring them to do so. While there are dozens of companies operating in the touting world, in practice there are just a few hundred major players, often known as \u201cbrokers\u201d or \u201cpower sellers\u201d by resale websites where they ply their trade. Such websites even offer these touts \u201cbroker tools\u201d, computer programs to help them manage their stocks of tickets. One ticket listed on StubHub for an Adele concert at Wembley Stadium includes a note, presumably directed to the resale site rather than consumers, that reads: \u201cCan you please provide us with a broker tool?\u201d StubHub did not respond to a request for information about broker tools. A representative of the website told MPs last year that it does not \u201cpolice or monitor\u201d whether touts using its site comply with the law by publishing their details. At the same evidence session, StubHub and Ticketmaster said that while they make it possible for seller to publish their details, it is up to the touts themselves to do so. Secondary sites, which take a commission of up to 25% on ticket sales, have previously been accused of having too close a relationship with touts. Such close relationships help touts make the best possible profit from resale and leave fans even more exposed to buying from these secretive entrepreneurs at massive mark-ups.",

He did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>In other cases, tickets are advertised as being sold by companies that are not registered at Companies House, or listed with a non-existent VAT number.</p> <p>Many touts simply do not publish any of their details at all on secondary websites, despite consumer laws requiring them to do so.</p> <p>While there are dozens of companies operating in the touting world, in practice there are just a few hundred major players, often known as \u201cbrokers\u201d or \u201cpower sellers\u201d by resale websites where they ply their trade.<br></p> <p>Such websites even offer these touts \u201cbroker tools\u201d, computer programs to help them manage their stocks of tickets.</p> <p>One ticket listed on StubHub for an Adele concert at Wembley Stadium includes a note, presumably directed to the resale site rather than consumers, that reads: \u201cCan you please provide us with a broker tool?\u201d</p> <p>StubHub did not respond to a request for information about broker tools.<br></p> <p>A representative of the website told MPs last year that it does not \u201cpolice or monitor\u201d whether touts using its site comply with the law by publishing their details.</p> <p>At the same evidence session, StubHub and Ticketmaster said that while they make it possible for seller to publish their details, it is up to the touts themselves to do so.</p> <p>Secondary sites, which take a commission of up to 25% on ticket sales, have previously been accused of having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/16/bands-fans-declare-war-online-ticket-touts\">too close a relationship with touts</a>.</p> <p>Such close relationships help touts make the best possible profit from resale and leave fans even more exposed to buying from these secretive entrepreneurs at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/02/adele-tickets-appear-online-for-9000-despite-singers-efforts-to-stop-touts\">massive mark-ups</a>.</p> <p><br></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At one time, so many visitors would bother him for directions that the newsagent next to Seaford station put up a sign on his door, with exact instructions on how to get to the Seven Sisters, the chalk cliffs that run east from the town to Beachy Head. Lately, with train services eroded and finally halted by the long-running dispute between unions and Southern railway, the sign has barely been needed. \u201cI\u2019m not a negotiator but if I was I\u2019d bang their bloody heads together,\u201d said the shop\u2019s proprietor, Brian Tickner. \u201cOther conflicts in the world have been sorted out. It must be able to be sorted.\u201d Normally, even in winter, there would be a regular flow of Chinese tourists and day-trippers from London to walk the coastal path. Worse is the lack of trains for Seaford\u2019s commuters, without whom, Tickner says, business is terrible. He has \u201cno sympathy at all with either side\u201d in the rail dispute: \u201cI\u2019ve seen too many people affected. The railway employees at the end of this will still have a job. But the guy working in construction in London won\u2019t.\u201d There are signs of a breakthrough. Talks between the drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, and Southern\u2019s owners, Govia Thameslink Railway, restarted and are continuing this week. Aslef has suspended a planned strike and, crucially for Seaford, lifted an overtime ban that has left Southern short of drivers and left this branch line virtually closed for almost two months. The dispute is not over \u2013 the RMT union, representing the conductors whose responsibilities for train doors are being transferred to reluctant drivers, is not in the talks and went on strike again on Monday. But Southern has said trains to Seaford will be restored on Tuesday: a development that will vastly improve the wellbeing of commuters to London and of local schools, businesses and families who have felt the impact too. The word \u201clifeline\u201d comes up regularly here in conversation about the trains. Two direct daily services to the capital and regular connections at Lewes had made Seaford a viable residence for commuters, swelling the faded resort to a town of 27,000 people. But those commutes have become epics of cancellations, delays and desperate alternatives. Disruption has also affected sixth-formers and students who travel by train to Brighton or Lewes. Businesses are suffering, not just because visitors \u2013 to local companies as well as tourists \u2013 are deterred, but because journeys within the area are harder, as more people turn to cars. Jams and delays have multiplied on largely single-lane coast roads, not least through Newhaven, the cross-Channel ferry port which has also been left trainless. Traders are feeling the pinch, according to the president of Seaford\u2019s chamber of commerce, Alasdair Fortune. While his own business, Badger Inks, does not directly rely on visitors, neighbouring cafes and shops do. \u201cIf the traders around me are affected, then they aren\u2019t buying my services. It all has a knock-on effect.\u201d Many fear, in dark moments, that the line could eventually be lost. Fortune said it would \u201ckill the town\u201d. The local Conservative MP, Maria Caulfield, said there was \u201cno way\u201d that the government would allow the line to be cut but said she understood the concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s having an enormous impact. This has been a misery for 18 months.\u201d While rail replacement buses are a poor substitute, things have deteriorated to the point where Caulfield said parts of her constituency, even on the main line, would welcome them: \u201cIt\u2019s tough on Seaford, but it\u2019s tough on the rural villages who have nothing. Trains are regularly terminated early or don\u2019t stop at the stations \u2013 they are having to get taxis home, and pay hundreds of pounds more to get their kids on a school bus. They are stranded.\u201d Southern trains now run along Seaford\u2019s branch line only as far south as Lewes. In the heart of what should be a well-trodden interchange station is the long-established Runaway Cafe. When the disruption started, the cafe tried selling coffee outside; now, on strike days, it closes altogether. Pawe\u0142 Szala, the cafe\u2019s manager, said: \u201cWe still pay the people but we don\u2019t have any income \u2013 so it\u2019s been a hard time for us to survive.\u201d He added: \u201cI understand that drivers worry about safety, it\u2019s a massive responsibility for thousands of people.\u201d Told of the latest talks, he clasped his hands together in prayer. \u201cGreat! I\u2019ll open a bottle of champagne with my staff if it\u2019s resolved, if we survive.\u201d As the sun set beside Seaford Head, Charlotte Cockburn, 38, arrived home from her teaching job in the village of Firle, 10 miles away. Her husband, Robert, works in London. \u201cWe decided that one commuter in the family is enough \u2013 you can\u2019t have two, someone\u2019s always late.\u201d Their children, four-year-old Reuben and six-year-old Hope, used to get bedtime stories from their dad. \u201cHe\u2019s gone before they wake up, so that\u2019s their lifeline.\u201d With a two-hour journey often eventually taking four, the children sometimes do not see him for days. \u201cSo it\u2019s really upsetting for them, if I have to explain that Daddy\u2019s late because the train isn\u2019t working again.\u201d Cockburn, in desperation, twice wrote to Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, in the autumn to appeal for help, telling him: \u201cI feel my family life is at threat.\u201d She has yet to receive a reply. She said: \u201cWe\u2019re in a nice road, in a nice house: that\u2019s why people move here, they want their kids to grow up in the country near the beach in a quiet safe place. The commute was just about doable. Something like this just throws a curveball.\u201d Now, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s just miserable, a horrible existence really, commuting on that line.\u201d Having been delayed by \u2013 and sometimes unable to board \u2013 rail replacement buses, and sometimes unable to find a taxi when trains have been cancelled, Robert now drives to Lewes and pays a daily parking fee of \u00a36.20 on top of the \u00a35,000-a-year season ticket. With an understanding employer (John Lewis), he has managed to sometimes work at home and keep his job. Others have been less fortunate. Back at Lewes from London Victoria and waiting in the freezing January night outside the station for the replacement bus, a civil servant delivered a long tirade against Southern, then asked to remain anonymous because of her job. Four people she knew had been sacked after written warnings, despite their efforts to get to work, due to the trains. Also in the queue was Stephanie Harvey, who works in banking in London. She was looking for a new post, but she said: \u201cI\u2019ve been told in job interviews that I\u2019m not reliable, because I commute on Southern.\u201d Suspending the strikes should bring some relief. But, as Caulfield said: \u201cEven if the dispute was resolved tomorrow, we know there have been performance issues with Southern.\u201d Commuters, and their forlorn families, agree. Cockburn said: \u201cIt\u2019s still a nightmare. Never mind the strikes, it\u2019s the service in general, the continuum of unreliability. If it was just the odd strike, I think people could handle it.\u201d",

With just a month to go until the election, Betfair gave Trump just a 14% chance of winning after a tape emerged of the presidential candidate boasting about groping women. The bookmaker still gave Clinton a 74% chance of winning two weeks later, after the FBI reopened an investigation into her use of private email servers. An outsider\u2019s victory usually favours bookmakers because they end up paying out to very few people. And if a flurry of bets are placed on an outsider, at a horse race for instance, the bookmaker will usually respond by shortening the odds to limit what it will pay out. But in the case of Trump, bookmakers refused to believe he had a good chance of winning right up until election day and did not adjust his odds. That meant big returns for punters who believed all along that he had a chance. Created last year by the merger of Paddy Power and Betfair, the group also suffered a \u00a335m hit from \u201ccustomer friendly\u201d sports results towards the end of 2016. These included 12 goals in 12 games for Ibrahimovic, who the bookmaker said typically attracts the biggest stakes from gamblers betting on a goalscorer. Revenues were up 11% but the group cut its forecast for full-year underlying profits, which it had previously said could reach \u00a3405m, to about the \u201cmid-point\u201d between \u00a3390m and \u00a3405m.",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group suffered 48-hour online attack this month as cybercriminals attempted to block access to 20m UK accounts. The denial of service attack ran for two days from Wednesday 11 January to Friday 13 January, as Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland were bombarded with millions of fake requests, designed to grind the group\u2019s systems to a halt. Usually in a denial of service (DOS) attack the criminals demand a large ransom, to be paid in bitcoins, to end the onslaught. However, no accounts were hacked or compromised during the attack, and Lloyds did not pay a ransom. In a cat-and-mouse game across the planet, IT security experts at Lloyds \u201cgeo-blocked\u201d the source of the attack. This effectively drops a portcullis over the server launching the attacks, but also stops legitimate customer requests from that area too. The cybercriminals then move to another server, and the geo-blocking game begins again. It explains the intermittent nature of the service issues at Lloyds during the period of the attack, with some customers complaining that they could not log on, but most experiencing normal service. Lloyds declined to comment on the specific nature of the attack. In a statement, it said: \u201cWe experienced intermittent service issues with internet banking between Wednesday morning and Friday afternoon the week before last and are sorry for any inconvenience caused. \u201cWe had a normal service in place for the vast majority of this period and only a small number of customers experienced problems. In most cases if customers attempted another log-in they were able to access their accounts. \u201cWe will not speculate on the cause of these intermittent issues.\u201d Andrew Tyrie, chair of the House of Commons Treasury select committee, called for the financial services industry to create a single point of responsibility to tackle cyber risks. In a statement issued on Monday, he said: \u201cAs millions of customers are exposed to the risks of cybercrime, a higher level of scrutiny and accountability for existing arrangements is needed.\u201d The incident comes just months after a far more serious cyber-heist against Tesco Bank, when criminals launched an \u201cunprecedented\u201d online attack that resulted in the loss of \u00a32.5m from 9,000 accounts. Several other major British banks have been hit by service outages over the past two years when their systems were flooded with fake requests. In January last year, HSBC\u2019s internet banking facility was made unavailable following a DOS attack, but no transactions were affected. In 2015, Royal Bank of Scotland revealed it suffered a cyber-attack on its online services that left customers struggling to log on for nearly an hour \u2013 just as monthly pay cheques were arriving in accounts. The threat to Britain\u2019s financial infrastructure from persistent cyber-attacks was partly behind the pledge by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in November to spend an extra \u00a31.9bn protecting UK online defences. Outdated computer systems are allowing malicious hackers to target everyone from companies at board level to individuals in their living rooms, according to the chancellor. The money will help boost the National Cyber Security Centre, the new division of the surveillance agency GCHQ created last month. Andrew Tyrie, MP, chair of the Treasury select committee, said that responsibility for reducing cyber threats is shared too widely among a number of bodies, including the Prudential Regulatory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority and GCHQ, and needs to be simplified. \u201cThe attack on Lloyds was deeply troubling. Thousands of customers were affected by this, the latest in a long list of failures and breaches of banking IT systems.,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I have already pointed out, it is time to consider whether a single point of responsible for cyber risk in the financial services sector is now required.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Official figures this week are expected to provide fresh evidence that the UK economy remained resilient in the face of Brexit uncertainty at the close of 2016 but economists warn Britain is headed for a sharp slowdown this year. After confounding most economic forecasters with solid GDP growth of 0.6% in the three months following June\u2019s referendum, the economy is expected to have grown 0.5% in the final quarter of last year, according to a Reuters poll of economists. Chris Hare, economist at the bank Investec was among those predicting the GDP figures on Thursday would show a strong finish to the year. \u201cThe UK economy has held up remarkably well after last June\u2019s vote to leave the EU. Businesses and households have largely shrugged off the political and economic uncertainties relating to Brexit, keeping the economy running at a decent pace,\u201d he said. Hopes of solid growth have been buoyed by largely upbeat surveys of businesses and consumers. In particular, the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs) showed the construction, manufacturing and services sectors all grew at the end of 2016 and pointed to 0.5% GDP growth in the final quarter. Consumer spending is expected to have provided the main momentum behind the UK\u2019s continued growth, helping to make it the top performer among the G7 group of advanced economies last year. With inflation already at a two-and-a-half-year high and expected to rise further, that support from spending will be harder to maintain, experts warn. The Bank of England expects the weak pound to continue to raise import costs and for some of that to be passed on to consumers, squeezing their spending power. The latest retail sales figures suggested price rises were already affecting shoppers in December as sales volumes suffered their sharpest drop for more than four years. Hare continued: \u201cLooking forward, we do anticipate a slowdown in economic growth, principally because we see the post-referendum fall in the pound pushing up on import prices, in turn raising the CPI inflation rate to more than 3% later this year. That will squeeze household spending power.\u201d Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy, Pantheon Macroeconomics echoed that. \u201cThe Brexit vote has done little to dampen GDP growth, so far. Output likely increased by about 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, only slightly less than in the third quarter. But labour market and tax receipt data show the economy is starting to struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cGrowth in household spending will slow decisively in 2017 ... surveys continue to point to only slight increases in employment and sluggish wage gains. As such, real disposable income looks set to stagnate for two years.\u201d If fourth-quarter GDP growth is confirmed at 0.5% in Thursday\u2019s figures, it will be a markedly better outcome than economists had pencilled in at the time of the referendum. Both before and after the June vote, forecasters at the Bank and elsewhere said the decision to leave the EU would bring growth to a near-standstill by the end of the year. But as economic data repeatedly defied the gloomy predictions, the forecasts were rewritten amid criticism that the Bank and others had overdone their pessimism. Responding to such attacks this month, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said it was fair to describe his profession as being is \u201cin crisis\u201d, having failed to foresee the 2008 financial crash and misjudged the impact of the Brexit vote. The Bank is still predicting a sharp slowdown in 2017 as the impact of the weak pound and shaken business confidence begin to bite. In its November forecasts the Bank said GDP growth would slow to 1.4% this year from 2.2% in 2016. The International Monetary Fund is predicting a similar path for the UK, with growth at 1.5% this year. The fund had previously predicted an even sharper slowdown but was forced to concede the British economy had so far beaten its expectations since the June referendum. Against the backdrop of slower growth and as Brexit negotiations kick off in earnest, interest rates are widely expected to remain on hold at their record low of 0.25% for some time. In a new economic outlook published on Monday, the forecasting group EY ITEM Club predicts GDP will grow 1.3% this year, marking an upgrade from its October forecast for 0.8% growth. It expects growth to slow further in 2018, to just 1%. The group warns that with household incomes under pressure, the UK economy will be forced to become less reliant on consumer spending. It notes a silver lining in the weaker pound for exporters, because the currency\u2019s fall makes their goods more competitive overseas. The group forecasts exports will rise 3.3% this year and 5.2% in 2018. \u201cWe now expect the impact of Brexit on the UK economy to be shallower, but more prolonged than we did in October,\u201d said Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club. \u201cHowever, there is a sea change coming over the next three years. The fall in the pound will force the economy to be less reliant on consumer spending, leaving growth heavily dependent upon trade performance.\u201d",

The latest retail sales figures suggested price rises were already affecting shoppers in December as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/20/uk-retail-sales-december-inflation-brexit-vote-ons\">sales volumes suffered their sharpest drop for more than four years</a>.<br></p> <p>Hare continued: \u201cLooking forward, we do anticipate a slowdown in economic growth, principally because we see the post-referendum fall in the pound pushing up on import prices, in turn raising the CPI inflation rate to more than 3% later this year. That will squeeze household spending power.\u201d<br></p> <p>Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy, Pantheon Macroeconomics echoed that.</p> <p>\u201cThe Brexit vote has done little to dampen GDP growth, so far. Output likely increased by about 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, only slightly less than in the third quarter. But labour market and tax receipt data show the economy is starting to struggle,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cGrowth in household spending will slow decisively in 2017 ... surveys continue to point to only slight increases in employment and sluggish wage gains. As such, real disposable income looks set to stagnate for two years.\u201d</p> <p>If fourth-quarter GDP growth is confirmed at 0.5% in Thursday\u2019s figures, it will be a markedly better outcome than economists had pencilled in at the time of the referendum. Both before and after the June vote, forecasters at the Bank and elsewhere said the decision to leave the EU would bring growth to a near-standstill by the end of the year.<br></p> <p>But as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/21/post-referendum-gloom-fears-confounded-economic-evidence\">economic data repeatedly defied the gloomy predictions</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/09/city-banks-revise-brexit-doom-and-gloom-forecasts\">forecasts were rewritten</a> amid criticism that the Bank and others had overdone their pessimism. Responding to such attacks this month, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/05/chief-economist-of-bank-of-england-admits-errors\">fair to describe his profession as being is \u201cin crisis\u201d</a>, having failed to foresee the 2008 financial crash and misjudged the impact of the Brexit vote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/17/uk-inflation-now-its-the-pound-in-your-pocket-being-devalued\">UK inflation: now it's the pound in your pocket being devalued</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-rate-cuts-2017-growth-forecast-inflation\">Bank is still predicting a sharp slowdown in 2017</a> as the impact of the weak pound and shaken business confidence begin to bite. In its November forecasts the Bank said GDP growth would slow to 1.4% this year from 2.2% in 2016. </p> <p>The International Monetary Fund is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/16/imf-trump-protectionism-world-economy-trade-us-europe\">predicting a similar path for the UK</a>, with growth at 1.5% this year. The fund had previously predicted an even sharper slowdown but was forced to concede the British economy had so far beaten its expectations since the June referendum.</p> <p>Against the backdrop of slower growth and as Brexit negotiations kick off in earnest, interest rates are widely expected to remain on hold at their record low of 0.25% for some time.</p> <p>In a new economic outlook published on Monday, the forecasting group EY ITEM Club predicts GDP will grow 1.3% this year, marking an upgrade from its October forecast for 0.8% growth. It expects growth to slow further in 2018, to just 1%.</p> <p>The group warns that with household incomes under pressure, the UK economy will be forced to become less reliant on consumer spending. It notes a silver lining in the weaker pound for exporters, because the currency\u2019s fall makes their goods more competitive overseas. The group forecasts exports will rise 3.3% this year and 5.2% in 2018.</p> <p>\u201cWe now expect the impact of Brexit on the UK economy to be shallower, but more prolonged than we did in October,\u201d said Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, there is a sea change coming over the next three years. The fall in the pound will force the economy to be less reliant on consumer spending, leaving growth heavily dependent upon trade performance.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s chairman David Tyler was sanctioned by the supermarket\u2019s board after using the company\u2019s staff and suppliers to help revamp his country bolthole. The board sent Tyler, a City grandee who has led Sainsbury\u2019s since late 2009, a warning letter after an internal investigation concluded there had been \u201cmaterial breaches\u201d of three company policies which it viewed as an \u201cextremely serious matter\u201d. Tyler also paid \u00a35,000 to charity in recognition of the work done by Sainsbury\u2019s staff. The breaches, which occurred in 2013, were revealed in an internal investigation, which has come to light in documents seen by the Guardian. The revelation will be highly embarrassing for Tyler who has extensive board level experience and is currently also chairman of Hammerson, the listed shopping centre developer, and on the board of Domestic &amp; General warranty group. He was previously chairman of Logica, the IT and management consultancy, as well as private equity firm 3i and for many years was finance director of GUS, the former Argos to Burberry group. As pointed out in the company\u2019s internal report, Tyler had reason to pay close attention to the company\u2019s policy on conflicts of interest because in 2012 he led a review into sponsorship deals with Sainsbury\u2019s suppliers held by the racing driver son of Justin King, the then chief executive. King was not found to have breached company rules. Sainsbury\u2019s said in a statement: \u201cThis is an historical issue dating back to 2013. The chairman volunteered the information and the board conducted a thorough investigation in line with company policy, as they would with any other colleague in the same circumstances. \u201cAs a result of the investigation, the chairman was given a warning but the board concluded that his failure to comply with company policy was unintentional, that he did not act dishonestly and made no financial gain.\u201d In the investigation Tyler, who was paid \u00a3496,000 by Sainsbury\u2019s last year, was found to have used the services of a member of the supermarket\u2019s sustainability team, who had expertise in green energy and engineering, to review plans for underfloor heating systems at his barn conversion near Lewes in East Sussex. The Sainsbury\u2019s employee gave advice after visiting Tyler\u2019s property several times, during working hours, and asked a supermarket building contractor to develop a proposed action plan \u2013 which the firm carried out for free. It then conducted a \u00a310,000 installation of an oil-fired boiler in partnership with builders already working on Tyler\u2019s property. Two other Sainsbury\u2019s suppliers were also contacted for specialist advice on alternative fuel sources, such as biomass or groundfloor heat pumps, for the heating system. Tyler also arranged for another Sainsbury\u2019s employee to carry out \u201cthermal imaging\u201d \u2013 a method of assessing problems with insulation \u2013 at the property. He then contacted Sainsbury\u2019s company secretary Tim Fallowfield to arrange to compensate the company for its employees\u2019 time after which it emerged that he had also employed the supermarket\u2019s specialist building contractor. Sainsbury\u2019s review, which sought a quote for the work carried out by its contractor from Tyler\u2019s builder and then audited that, concluded that the chairman had paid the going market rate for the job and so hadn\u2019t benefited financially. It also calculated that \u00a35,000 paid to charity by Tyler was commensurate with the amount of time spent by Sainsbury\u2019s staff on his project. But the investigation led by Sainsbury\u2019s non-executive directors Mary Harris and Gary Hughes (who has since stepped down from the board) concluded that he had breached the company\u2019s code of ethical conduct and guidelines on ethical suppliers as well as policy on conflict of interest and relationships at work. Sainsbury\u2019s ethical supplier guidelines say staff should notify the company of any personal interest or relationship with suppliers. The conflict of interest policy says involvement in a personal or business relationship with a colleague, competitor or supplier \u201ccould affect or compromise what you do at work\u201d. The policy on conflicts of interest also warns that if someone has gained from such a relationship or caused or risked damage to Sainsbury\u2019s reputation as a result disciplinary action may be taken. \u201cIn serious cases this will be treated as gross misconduct and could lead to summary dismissal,\u201d the policy states. The report found Tyler had materially breached this because he did not initially disclose his relationship with staff member or supplier and gained advice and expertise from unapproved access to Sainsbury\u2019s workers. It found: \u201cHe received (paid for) services from an expert supplier due to his position that he would otherwise not have been able to.\u201d The ethical code also states that the company\u2019s assets \u201cshould not be used to facilitate personal activities\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s report reveals Tyler acknowledged \u201che was aware of the general spirit of the policies \u2013 though not all the details within them.\u201d It added that he had made this assertion despite some of the policies being presented to the board for review in January 2012.",
