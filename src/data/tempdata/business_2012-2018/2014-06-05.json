      "bodyText": "Vodafone, one of the world's largest mobile phone groups, has revealed the existence of secret wires that allow government agencies to listen to all conversations on its networks, saying they are widely used in some of the 29 countries in which it operates in Europe and beyond. The company has broken its silence on government surveillance in order to push back against the increasingly widespread use of phone and broadband networks to spy on citizens, and will publish its first Law Enforcement Disclosure Report on Friday. At 40,000 words, it is the most comprehensive survey yet of how governments monitor the conversations and whereabouts of their people. The company said wires had been connected directly to its network and those of other telecoms groups, allowing agencies to listen to or record live conversations and, in certain cases, track the whereabouts of a customer. Privacy campaigners said the revelations were a \"nightmare scenario\" that confirmed their worst fears on the extent of snooping. In Albania, Egypt, Hungary, India, Malta, Qatar, Romania, South Africa and Turkey, it is unlawful to disclose any information related to wiretapping or interception of the content of phone calls and messages including whether such capabilities exist. \"For governments to access phone calls at the flick of a switch is unprecedented and terrifying,\" said the Liberty director, Shami Chakrabarti. \"[Edward] Snowden revealed the internet was already treated as fair game. Bluster that all is well is wearing pretty thin \u2013 our analogue laws need a digital overhaul.\" In about six of the countries in which Vodafone operates, the law either obliges telecoms operators to install direct access pipes, or allows governments to do so. The company, which owns mobile and fixed broadband networks, including the former Cable &amp; Wireless business, has not named the countries involved because certain regimes could retaliate by imprisoning its staff. Direct-access systems do not require warrants, and companies have no information about the identity or the number of customers targeted. Mass surveillance can happen on any telecoms network without agencies having to justify their intrusion to the companies involved. Industry sources say that in some cases, the direct-access wire, or pipe, is essentially equipment in a locked room in a network's central data centre or in one of its local exchanges or \"switches\". The staff working in that room can be employed by the telecoms firm, but have state security clearance and are usually unable to discuss any aspect of their work with the rest of the company. Vodafone says it requires all employees to follow its code of conduct, but secrecy means that it cannot always verify that they do so. Government agencies can also intercept traffic on its way into a data centre, combing through conversations before routing them on to the operator. \"These are the nightmare scenarios that we were imagining,\" said Gus Hosein, executive director of Privacy International, which has brought legal action against the British government over mass surveillance. \"I never thought the telcos [telecommunications companies] would be so complicit. It's a brave step by Vodafone and hopefully the other telcos will become more brave with disclosure, but what we need is for them to be braver about fighting back against the illegal requests and the laws themselves.\" Vodafone's group privacy officer, Stephen Deadman, said: \"These pipes exist, the direct access model exists. \"We are making a call to end direct access as a means of government agencies obtaining people's communication data. Without an official warrant, there is no external visibility. If we receive a demand we can push back against the agency. The fact that a government has to issue a piece of paper is an important constraint on how powers are used.\" Vodafone is calling for all direct-access pipes to be disconnected, and for the laws that make them legal to be amended. It says governments should \"discourage agencies and authorities from seeking direct access to an operator's communications infrastructure without a lawful mandate\". All states should publish annual data on the number of warrants issued, the company argues. There are two types \u2013 those for the content of calls and messages, and those for the metadata, which can cover the location of a target's device, the times and dates of communications, and the people with whom they communicated. For brevity, the Guardian has also used the term metadata to cover warrants for customer information such as name and address. The information published in our table covers 2013 or the most recent year available. A single warrant can target hundreds of individuals and devices, and several warrants can target just one individual. Governments count warrants in different ways and New Zealand, for example, excludes those concerning national security. While software companies like Apple and Microsoft have jumped to publish the number of warrants they receive since the activities of America's NSA and Britain's GCHQ came to light, telecoms companies, which need government licences to operate, have been slower to respond. In America, Verizon and AT&amp;T have published data, but only on their domestic operations. Deutsche Telekom in Germany and Telstra in Australia have also broken ground at home. Vodafone is the first to produce a global survey. It shows that Malta is one of the most spied on nations in Europe. The former British protectorate has a tiny population of 420,000, but last year Vodafone alone processed 3,773 requests for metadata. In Italy, where the mafia's presence requires a high level of police intrusion, Vodafone received 606,000 metadata requests, more than any other country in which it runs networks. The number of warrants across all operators is potentially many times that number, but the government does not publish a national figure for metadata. Italy's parliament does disclose content warrants, however, and it issued 141,000 in 2012, compared with just 2,760 in the United Kingdom. In contrast to the UK, terrorism concerns mean Ireland does not allow any information on the number of content warrants to be made public. Spain, which has suffered terrorist strikes from Islamists and Basque separatists, allowed Vodafone to disclose that it had received over 24,000 content warrants. Agencies in the Czech Republic made nearly 8,000 content requests from the network. After Italy, the Czech Republic is the biggest user of metadata, issuing 196,000 warrants nationally in the most recent year for which information has been published. Tanzania, one of several African countries in which Vodafone operates, made 99,000 metadata requests from the company. Peter Micek, policy counsel at the campaign group Access, said: \"In a sector that has historically been quiet about how it facilitates government access to user data, Vodafone has for the first time shone a bright light on the challenges of a global telecom giant, giving users a greater understanding of the demands governments make of telcos. Vodafone's report also highlights how few governments issue any transparency reports, with little to no information about the number of wiretaps, cell site tower dumps, and other invasive surveillance practices.\" On the question of whether the UK uses direct-access pipes, Vodafone's Deadman said such a system would be illegal because Britain did not permit agencies to obtain information without a warrant. The law does, however, allow indiscriminate collection of information on an unidentified number of targets. \"We need to debate how we are balancing the needs of law enforcement with the fundamental rights and freedoms of the citizens. The ideal is we get a much more informed debate going, and we do all of that without putting our colleagues in danger.\" Snowden, the National Security Agency whistleblower, joined Google, Reddit, Mozilla and other tech firms and privacy groups on Thursday to call for a strengthening of privacy rights online in a \"Reset the net\" campaign. Twelve months after revelations about the scale of the US government's surveillance programs were first published in the Guardian and the Washington Post, Snowden said: \"One year ago, we learned that the internet is under surveillance, and our activities are being monitored to create permanent records of our private lives \u2013 no matter how innocent or ordinary those lives might be. Today, we can begin the work of effectively shutting down the collection of our online communications, even if the US Congress fails to do the same.\"",

That was the assumption that underpinned the bizarre and breezy willingness of some investors to pay almost 100 times earnings to get a slice of the action. If you pay those prices, you're asking for trouble. It has duly arrived, in the form of Asos's warning that its profit margin this financial year won't be anything like 6.5%. It will be just 4.5%. Bang goes about a third of this year's expected pre-tax profits. Forget \u00a365m, the outcome will be more like \u00a345m. What out-of-left-field mischief is at work? Despite Asos chief executive Nick Robertson's attempt to blame \"an unusual combination of factors,\" the explanation is mundane if you're in the game of selling goods to 200 countries: old-fashioned currency movements, specifically the strength of sterling. The Barnsley-based firm, operating off a sterling cost base and a sterling pricing structure, has been forced to discount heavily to compete in countries with weaker currencies \u2013 Russia, for example. What's more, when surplus stock is cleared in the UK, where sales are subject to VAT, the trade carries lower profit margins. In the scheme of things, this is merely a serious setback for Asos rather than a catastrophe. The introduction of so-called zonal pricing may help in time. But the manner in which the firm was dragged into heavy discounting ought to alarm investors. Maybe a steady profit margin of 6.5% is simply outside management's control when you're attempting to expand internationally at a rate of 30% a year. But Thursday's one-third collapse in the share price to \u00a331.20 is definitely a catastrophe for those investors who were chasing the stock at \u00a370 early this year. What were they thinking? At that point, Asos was worth \u00a36bn, or about 90 times expected profits before Thursday's heavy revision. Even now, at \u00a331.20, the stock is hardly cheap \u2013 the valuation represents about 75 times expected earnings of 40p a share. Would you really pay that for a business that has now had two profit warnings \u2013 a mild one in March and now a thumper \u2013 in the space of three months? Asos remains a great pioneering business \u2013 a UK internet champion in clothing. But the risks and potential rewards for investors still look wildly out of sync.",

The introduction of so-called zonal pricing may help in time. But the manner in which the firm was dragged into heavy discounting ought to alarm investors. Maybe a steady profit margin of 6.5% is simply outside management's control when you're attempting to expand internationally at a rate of 30% a year.</p> <p>But Thursday's one-third collapse in the share price to \u00a331.20 is definitely a catastrophe for those investors who were chasing the stock at \u00a370 early this year. What were they thinking? At that point, Asos was worth \u00a36bn, or about 90 times expected profits before Thursday's heavy revision.</p> <p>Even now, at \u00a331.20, the stock is hardly cheap \u2013 the valuation represents about 75 times expected earnings of 40p a share. Would you really pay that for a business that has now had two profit warnings \u2013 a mild one in March and now a thumper \u2013 in the space of three months?</p> <p>Asos remains a great pioneering business \u2013 a UK internet champion in clothing. But the risks and potential rewards for investors still look wildly out of sync.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When it first launched under the name As Seen on Screen, Asos was an online retail ingenue whose title referred to clothing first glimpsed on Hollywood stars, models and celebrities, then rapidly reproduced for trend-hunting consumers. But on Thursday the stockmarket turned its lens on the leading light of British e-commerce and sent its shares plummeting by 31% as a shock profit warning wiped \u00a31.2bn off its value. The group admitted that a strong pound had forced it to slash prices for non-UK customers and rely on less profitable sales to fashion-hungry British shoppers to maintain its stellar growth rate. It is the second jolt for investors in Asos, which first spooked the market in March when it admitted that higher warehouse costs and start-up losses in China would hit annual profits. The business has grown rapidly and become so successful that it is now setting celebrity fashion trends rather than emulating them \u2013 its own-label creations are worn by singer Rihanna and by Michelle Obama, who wore Asos's chequered red-and-white skater dress (now discounted to $73) on the campaign trail with her husband two years ago. Its chief executive, Nick Robertson, who founded Asos in 2000, said: \"I've really had a perfect storm. We've got to take this on the chin. It's frustrating \u2013 everything we are doing is building Asos into a much bigger business.\" But one retail expert said Asos faced renewed competition from traditional rivals who are fighting back against e-retailers on their own turf. \"This highlights that just being online is not an automatic road to success. As with everything else in retail a business has to give shoppers a good reason to visit and buy,\" said Maureen Hinton, of retail consultancy Conlumino. \"Asos has been the market innovator and leader in young fashion but it is facing much tougher and more extensive competition as the channel matures. This is not only from other pure plays but also from the number of physical retailers that are now going online in international markets,\" Hinton said, citing H&amp;M and Inditex, the owner of Zara. Another analyst queried whether Asos had expanded too quickly. Freddie George, of stockbroker Cantor Fitzgerald, said: \"We remain concerned that the ranges in womenswear have been expanded beyond the levels management can adequately control. Hence, we believe the company has seen significantly higher levels of markdown activity in womenswear and higher returns. He added: \"As with 'bricks and mortar' retail brands having a poor fashion season, the company will now have to reassess womenswear strategy and reduce the number of womenswear lines, which is likely to impact results.\" Robertson dismissed this as a \"red herring\" saying customers were still flocking to the retailer. \"It has nothing to do with the width of [the] womenswear [range],\" he said. Asos now expects to make a profit of \u00a345m this year, down from predictions of \u00a365m in March, which was in turn a downgrade from \u00a369m. City analysts slashed their forecasts following the trading statement. Analyst Matthew McEachran of Singer Capital Markets said: \"Today's news will come as a shock to many and is also worse than we had feared.\" Asos shares plummeted more than 40% at one point on Thursday, before recovering slightly to end the day down 31% at \u00a331.20 per share, valuing the company at \u00a33.8bn \u2013 a long way from its initial value of \u00a320m. Asos shares floated at 20p on London's Aim in 2001, just as the dotcom bubble burst and a year after Robertson launched the company in north London with \u00a32.3m of seed capital from financier Andrew Regan and Robertson's brother, an entrepreneur based in Monte Carlo. However, the bulk of Asos's 4,000 employees are based in a distribution centre in Barnsley. Despite the setback, Robertson insisted the company's expansion remained on track: \"We are totally focused on rolling out the Asos business model globally as the world's leading online fashion destination for twentysomethings.\" Its breakneck international sales growth has slowed this year as the pound strengthened to a five-and-a-half-year high against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, forcing the company to offer big price cuts to shift surplus stock, which have eaten into its profit margins. The excess stock has been cleared but the continued strength of the pound means Asos will have to cut its prices in many countries \u2013 excluding the UK \u2013 to remain competitive. It is still growing at a double-digit rate, though. Retail sales climbed 25% in the three months to the end of May, with the UK up 43%, while international sales growth slowed to 17% owing to the strength of sterling. Overall sales growth has slowed from 38% in the first quarter and 26% in the second quarter. The number of active customers \u2013 those who have shopped at Asos in the last 12 months \u2013 rose by nearly a third to 8.6 million. Analysts Retail analyst Freddie George at Cantor Fitzgerald said: \"We remain concerned that the ranges in womenswear have been expanded beyond the levels management can adequately control. Hence, we believe the company has seen significantly higher levels of markdown activity in womenswear and higher returns. \"As with 'bricks and mortar' retail brands having a poor fashion season, the company will now have to reassess womenswear strategy and reduce the number of womenswear lines, which is likely to impact results, in particular sales over the spring-summer 2014 and autumn/-winter 2014/-15.\" Robertson dismissed this as a \"red herring,\" saying all the customer metrics \u2013 customer numbers, order size and order frequency \u2013 are on the up. \"It has nothing to do with the width of womenswear,\" he said.In China, Asos has struggled with complex restrictions on the clothing trade which meant in some cases it was easier to send garments made there to the UK, and then back again, rather than transport them directly within China. Other items had to be re-labelled by hand to meet Chinese requirements on washing instructions.",

    "webTitle": "ECB launches bold measures including negative interest rate to boost eurozone", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank unveiled an unprecedented package of measures on Thursday in a dramatic attempt to inject life into the eurozone's flagging economy and ward off a damaging deflationary spiral. In a historic first for the troubled region, the ECB boss, Mario Draghi, and his colleagues on the governing council cut the deposit rate for the region's commercial banks to -0.1% from zero. The central bank also cut its main interest rate to a new record low of 0.15% from 0.25%, and announced a \u20ac400bn (\u00a3325bn) package of cheap funding for banks on the condition it is used to lend money to companies outside the financial sector, and not for mortgages. Draghi has come under intense pressure over recent months to make cheaper credit available to households and businesses to boost growth in the 18-member currency zone. In the last quarter, GDP growth stumbled to just 0.2% and only avoided contraction thanks to a strong performance by the German economy. The ECB stopped short of pumping funds directly into the financial system via a programme of quantitative easing (QE), but Draghi said the bank would \"intensify preparatory work\" should it prove necessary, and left the door open to further stimulus if needed. \"We think this is a significant package. Are we finished here? The answer is no. \"If required, we will act swiftly with further monetary policy easing. The governing council is unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments within its mandate should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation.\" The decision to impose a negative deposit rate on banks was described as a \"bold and unusual move\" by Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight. Trevor Greetham, a director at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said: \"Draghi handsomely beat expectations by adopting all of the measures under discussion and leaving the door open to future QE by way of asset purchases if they need to boost growth further or turn sentiment around in a crisis situation.\" Action was widely predicted by analysts and markets amid a mounting threat that persistently low inflation in the 18-nation eurozone could lead to outright deflation. But it was unclear what form it would take. Data published by the EU's statistics office revealed an unexpected fall in the annual rate of eurozone inflation to 0.5% in May from 0.7% in April, which appeared to seal the deal for more ECB stimulus. With a lack of inflationary pressure amid a weak economic recovery, the fear is the eurozone will slide into a destructive deflation trap, where consumers and businesses delay spending in anticipation of lower prices in the future. The ECB also lowered its eurozone inflation forecasts to 2016. Draghi said the annual rate was expected to stay at low levels in the coming months and would only rise gradually through 2015 and 2016. Inflation is expected to reach 1.5% by the final quarter of 2016. However, he played down the threat of deflation. \"We don't see deflation, a self-fulfilling negative spiral.\" The euro fell as investors digested the ECB's gloomier forecasts and the sweeping cuts in borrowing rates. But the Paris Cac and Frankfurt Dax benefited from the prospect of higher growth in the eurozone as a result of the policy shift. The Cac jumped 42 points to 4,543 and the Dax increased by 7.4 points to 9,943. But some economists said the measures would prove to be too little, too late. Marc Ostwald, an economist at Monument Securities said: \"In theory, this should help, but as has been obvious in the UK, where borrowing by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is still quite weak and SME deposits are high, SMEs' distrust of the financial sector post the credit crisis remains very high.\" Draghi said the purpose of the June policy meeting was threefold: to ease monetary policy; enhance the impact of measures on the real economy; and reaffirm a willingness to use unconventional measures if further easing is needed. Draghi said the decision on the package was unanimous among the 24-strong governing council, which includes the governors of the national central banks of the 18 eurozone countries, signalling \"an extraordinarily unusual degree of consensus\". This indicated that Germany's Bundesbank \u2013 once unconvinced of the use of such measures \u2013 had backed the latest plan. The Bank of England, which has already cut borrowing rates for banks and pumped \u00a3375bn of QE into the UK economy, announced at the end of its monthly meeting that it would maintain interest rates at 0.5% and the same level of QE.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The former chairman of Morrisons has launched an extraordinary public tirade against the supermarket's leadership, describing the chief executive's strategy as \"bullshit\" and warning that the business founded by his father had been ruined. Sir Ken Morrison, 82, tore into Morrisons boss Dalton Philips in a scathing intervention at the retailer's annual general meeting. After watching Philips outline his strategy to modernise the Bradford-based chain, Morrison told the chief executive: \"When I left work and started working as a hobby, I chose to raise cattle. I have something like 1,000 bullocks and, having listened to your presentation, Dalton, you've got a lot more bullshit than me.\" Dressed in his trademark striped company tie, Morrison's outburst drew loud applause from hundreds of independent shareholders in the meeting at the company's Bradford headquarters as he picked apart the record of Philips and his management colleagues. He said the supermarkets had been neglected in favour of ill-conceived ventures into babywear retailing, convenience stores and selling online. \"A really first-class business has been ruined by a lack of leadership from the top,\" said Morrison, who built his father's grocery shop into a national chain before stepping down in 2008. \"The results have been described by the chairman and the chief executive as disappointing. I personally thought they were disastrous.\" Over the past three months alone Morrisons has reported a 7.1% slump in sales \u2013 the biggest revenue drop at a listed supermarket in a generation. When Philips joined Morrisons in 2010 the business did not have a website or convenience stores, which are the industry's fastest-growing sales channels. Morrison's comments came as shareholders registered a significant protest vote against the management team who have presided over a 27% fall in the FTSE 100 company's share price over the past year. According to initial voting returns, 14% of those voting voted against Philips's re-election, 10.7% registered a protest against the chairman, Sir Ian Gibson, and 26.5% against the remuneration policy. Gibson announced at the AGM he would stand down next year. But he denied he had felt under pressure to do so, saying he decided to announce his departure to \"clear up any speculation and uncertainty\" and put an \"orderly plan\" in place. In the packed meeting a chorus of former and current employee-shareholders, family members and small investors, some of whom had travelled a considerable distance to attend, criticised the company for a series of strategic missteps, particularly the purchase of baby goods retailer Kiddicare which cost it \u00a3163m in profit writedowns. Several shareholders called for the board to step down and for more attention to be given to standards in the big supermarkets which form the core of Morrisons' business. Chris Blundell, Morrison's nephew and a former Morrisons director, added: \"I think we're in a rescue situation here and it needs urgent action. Things need to be done very quickly. We are losing our reputation. A reputation is everything in business and I think you've lost that to a great extent.\" Gibson said the business was suffering alongside many of its rivals amid dramatic changes in the way shoppers buy their groceries. But he said that over the past few years Morrisons had performed well against its peers, with improved profits, free cash flow and strong dividends. \"This company is not in a rescue situation. It's a very sound business that is in the process of still growing,\" he said. He admitted that buying Kiddicare and particularly 10 large stores for its expansion was a mistake but said mistakes had been made in previous generations at the company. In a remark clearly aimed at Sir Ken, he said: \"We are still paying for some of those [mistakes]. To have to launch online 16 to 14 years after the competition, not knowing anything about IT as a consequence, is one of the problems.\" Gibson's planned departure in a year's time could increase the pressure on Philips to produce results that will impress a new chairman. Philips, who admitted it was his toughest annual shareholder meeting in his four years in charge of the business, said: \"There's a well documented difference on strategy between Sir Ken and myself. My job is to deliver on the strategy we have outlined to shareholders with their support.\" While the founding family's comments could revive speculation that they are planning a bid for the company, Morrison appeared to pour cold water on the idea. He said: \"I'm far too old to consider anything of that manner and other members of the family have got other interests.\"",

      "bodyText": "Fashion company Burberry handed Christopher Bailey, promoted to chief executive last month, a one-off award of shares worth almost \u00a315m last summer. The award of the shares, which are not related to performance, was revealed in the annual report, which also showed that Bailey was handed another one-off award of shares in December 2010 worth around \u00a34m at the time. The disclosure of the share handouts follows the revelation last month that Bailey, previously the company's chief creative officer, was handed a golden hello in shares worth up to \u00a37.6m. Following his promotion to chief executive, to replace Angela Ahrendts who has joined Apple, Bailey was awarded 500,000 shares, which are related to performance and could pay out between 2017 and 2019. The share price last night was \u00a314.95. The UK-born executive, who remains both the chief creative and chief executive officer, is also receiving \u00a3440,000 of cash allowances on top of a \u00a31.1m salary and annual cash bonus of up to \u00a32.2m. In total Bailey could receive up to \u00a310.3m this year, depending on the company's performance. The company provides little disclosure about how many shares Bailey \u2013 who is in his 13th year at Burberry \u2013 owns or could own through share schemes. But it does reveal that \u2013 well before he became chief executive \u2013 he was handed 1m shares in July 2013 and 350,000 in December 2010, which he will receive between 2015 and 2018 and which are not related to performance. In the annual report, Ahrendts - who is holding on to two share bonuses worth up to \u00a36.2m and is receiving \u00a340m in shares from her employer Apple - writes that she is looking forward to watching the company develop. Sir John Peace, chairman of the company and nominations committee, said in the annual report that Bailey had been appointed to the enlarged role because of \"unique qualities and deep experience\" and that head hunters were not used to find a successor to Ahrendts. Other annual reports released on Thursday show that the boss of Marks &amp; Spencer, Marc Bolland, missed out on bonuses and rejected a pay rise. His salary was unchanged at \u00a3970,000 and his total pay down from \u00a32.1m to \u00a31.6m.",

At launch in 2002, Asos was a relatively modest operation built on a simple, but smart, idea: take a picture of a celebrity wearing a cool outfit and offer customers the chance to buy an affordable alternative, unashamedly mimicked by the north London brand's in-house designers.</p> <p>Fourteen years on, the brand no longer relies on gauche paparazzi shots to flog its wares.

      "bodyText": "When Michelle Obama was pictured wearing a red and white checkered Asos dress while on the campaign trail with her husband, President Obama, in 2012, the online retailer's fashion circle appeared to be complete. At launch in 2002, Asos was a relatively modest operation built on a simple, but smart, idea: take a picture of a celebrity wearing a cool outfit and offer customers the chance to buy an affordable alternative, unashamedly mimicked by the north London brand's in-house designers. Fourteen years on, the brand no longer relies on gauche paparazzi shots to flog its wares. It sells more than 850 other brands, from high street stalwarts River Island to French designer brand Cacherel, employs more than 4,000 people \u2013 and now it's the celebrities who are photographed in Asos clothes.

He has won the whole of the European Central Bank's ruling council round to the idea that action needed to be taken to prevent the eurozone becoming the new Japan. Whether he has yet done enough to stop disinflation becoming outright deflation is another matter.</p> <p>In truth, the ECB did as much as could have been expected at this meeting. It cut interest takes, taking the historic step of making commercial banks pay for lodging money at the ECB. And it came up with its version of the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme (FLS) with a targeted scheme that will reward banks that bump up their lending to private firms. This excludes lending to the real estate market, which shows that the ECB has learned some lessons from the FLS, which was a lot more successful at boosting mortgage lending than at providing funds for small- and medium-sized companies.</p> <p>Was this action justified? There is no question that it was. Even the hawks on the ECB council led by Germany's Jens Weidmann are uncomfortable with an inflation rate of 0.5% and annual growth in the money supply of 1%. Inflation and the money supply are the twin pillars of ECB policy: both are running well below target.</p> <p>Will the action help? Yes, but the impact is unlikely to be that dramatic....</p> </blockquote> <h2>Here's the full piece: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/jun/05/european-central-bank-action-eurozone-deflation-lending\">ECB's justified action will help but is no panacea for eurozone deflationary ills</a></h2> <p>And that's all for tonight.</p> <p>Our news story about the ECB's historic rate-cuts is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/05/european-central-bank-cuts-deposit-rates\">European Central Bank imposes negative interest rates on banks</a></h2> <p>Live coverage of <b>Mario Draghi's</b> press conference <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2014/jun/05/european-central-bank-ecb-markets-rate-cuts-stimulus-business-live#block-539062e7e4b0353334fbc304\">starts here</a>.</p> <p>There's a summary of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2014/jun/05/european-central-bank-ecb-markets-rate-cuts-stimulus-business-live#block-539075eae4b0301c656d4065\">the key points here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f8b87330-cbfd-4b0c-9524-33a21c648d4b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/5/1401987652568/433927d7-1c50-4c98-8735-5615d930905b-460x276.png\" alt=\"ECB policy decisions, June 5 2014\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> Photograph: Lorcan Roche Kelly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reaction from City economists, and irate German banks, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2014/jun/05/european-central-bank-ecb-markets-rate-cuts-stimulus-business-live#block-53907d80e4b0301c656d4070\"><b>starts here</b></a>.<br></p> <p>Thanks, and goodnight. <b>GW</b><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53909b17e4b034cc0d2e82f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-05T16:42:22.650Z\">5.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The euro has clawed back all its earlier losses and is now higher against the US dollar today <b>at $1.364</b>, despite the interest rate cuts and other measures announced by the ECB.</p> <p>It looks like a mixture of profit-taking (the euro had weakened in recent weeks as traders anticipated rate cuts) and some disappointment that Mario Draghi didn't go even further.</p> <p><b> John Clarke, c</b>hief investment officer at GHC Capital Markets, argues<b>:</b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe ECB has got it wrong again.

      "bodyText": "And finally, here's economics editor Larry Elliott's take on today's events: Mario Draghi has acted. He has won the whole of the European Central Bank's ruling council round to the idea that action needed to be taken to prevent the eurozone becoming the new Japan. Whether he has yet done enough to stop disinflation becoming outright deflation is another matter. In truth, the ECB did as much as could have been expected at this meeting. It cut interest takes, taking the historic step of making commercial banks pay for lodging money at the ECB. And it came up with its version of the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme (FLS) with a targeted scheme that will reward banks that bump up their lending to private firms. This excludes lending to the real estate market, which shows that the ECB has learned some lessons from the FLS, which was a lot more successful at boosting mortgage lending than at providing funds for small- and medium-sized companies. Was this action justified? There is no question that it was. Even the hawks on the ECB council led by Germany's Jens Weidmann are uncomfortable with an inflation rate of 0.5% and annual growth in the money supply of 1%. Inflation and the money supply are the twin pillars of ECB policy: both are running well below target. Will the action help? Yes, but the impact is unlikely to be that dramatic.... Here's the full piece: ECB's justified action will help but is no panacea for eurozone deflationary ills And that's all for tonight. Our news story about the ECB's historic rate-cuts is here: European Central Bank imposes negative interest rates on banks Live coverage of Mario Draghi's press conference starts here. There's a summary of the key points here. Reaction from City economists, and irate German banks, starts here. Thanks, and goodnight. GW The euro has clawed back all its earlier losses and is now higher against the US dollar today at $1.364, despite the interest rate cuts and other measures announced by the ECB. It looks like a mixture of profit-taking (the euro had weakened in recent weeks as traders anticipated rate cuts) and some disappointment that Mario Draghi didn't go even further. John Clarke, chief investment officer at GHC Capital Markets, argues: \u201cThe ECB has got it wrong again. Policy rates were already close to the zero bound and a further cut to 0.15% was neither here nor there. Proper QE is what is needed but sadly this won\u2019t happen.\u201d Europe's stock markets have closed, with gains in all the major eurozone exchanges. The French CAC jumped 1%, with Germany's DAX rising a more modest 0.2% - having earlier broken through the 10,000 mark for the first time. The main reaction to the ECB's measures can be seen in the bond markets, where prices of eurozone government debt have risen across the board, pushing down bond yields. Boosting the supply of credit is all well and good, but the ECB hasn't done much to stimulate demand for lending in the bruised eurozone economy, says Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex Europe: She writes: \"Instead of choosing between a range of liquidity operations to back-up rate cuts, the ECB has effectively chosen all of them. Draghi affectively announced that he will throw more than \u20ac565 billion at Eurozone money markets to stimulate credit and get money flowing. The arsenal of measures proposed will flood the European banking system with funding supply, but they still haven\u2019t addressed the question of demand. Which means the ECB could be forced into 'unconventional instruments' -- namely a broad asset purchase scheme: \u201cThe only thing left for the ECB to do is large scale asset purchases, and given Draghi\u2019s glowing write-up of the Asset Backed Securities markets for SME loans, any sovereign QE similar to that of the Fed and the Bank of England is unlikely. The WSJ has published a handy explainer about one of the more complicated decisions taken today -- to stop \"sterilising\" the government bonds which the ECB bought at the height of the crisis. Here's a flavour: Each week, [the ECB] offered banks interest-bearing deposits equal to the amount of government bonds the ECB still has on its balance sheet. This drained money from the financial markets, but only temporarily so it must be repeated weekly. Does It Matter? By halting sterilization the ECB is, in effect, delivering its own QE, albeit a relatively modest amount. How modest? Around \u20ac164bn of extra liquidity. Small compared to the US Federal Reserve, which was pumping $85bn of extra cash every month into America's system last year. But better than nothing.... The European Commission has now expressed \"serious concern\" over the resignation of Greece's head of tax revenue collection (see 4.45pm) (click to see the full statement) Haris Theohari's departure came hours after it emerged that the IMF's latest report on Greece has been delayed (see earlier post) Negative interest rates could potentially come back and bite the ECB, if it forces banks to buy riskier assets in an attempt to find profits, warns Belgian economist Geert Noels. Today's interest rate cuts will help, but won't revitalise the eurozone's weaker areas on their own, reckons Robin Johnson, partner at law firm Eversheds: \"While macro economic indicators indicate the Eurozone is not out of the woods (unlike the UK, US and Sweden where deal activity is booming) we are finding pockets of activity across the continent. This is particularly the case in the likes of Spain, Italy and Northern Germany although France is quieter*. \"Anything to ensure the Eurozone moves with non Eurozone economies must be welcomed but the move is ultimately unlikely to be seen as a game changer.\" * France is the only major EU country whose private sector appears to have contracted in May, based on surveys published earlier this week It's been a dramatic day in Greece, where the general secretary of public revenues, Haris Theohari, has quit. Theohari's resignation has caused consternation to Greece's lenders - the troika - which had demanded the post be created to oversee tax collection. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Accepting his resignation, the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras (who is believed to be on his way out too): said \u201cWith his efforts Mr Theoharis gave decisive support to tax reform and the targets the government has had over the past two years with ethics, a feeling of responsibility and integrity. .. he was asked to overhaul the tax and customs administration and from point zero, he started radical reforms which have laid the basis for the operation of a contemporary, independent and affective system.\u201d But insiders are saying the resignation of Theoharis, a British-trained software engineer, may not be so surprising. Recently Strournaras blasted his colleague \u2013 in public - for failing to rein in big tax cheats. Since then the two men have been at loggerheads. \u201cWe are still chasing the small fish and not the nedium and large-scale tax evaders who live lavishly at society\u2019s expense,\" Stournaras said. \"We have provided the General Secretary with all the weapons and made all the necessary legislative regulations for him to make any changes he wishes \u2026 in order to combat large-scale tax evasion.\u201d Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, warns that the \"unprecedented\" step taken today may not be enough to weaken the euro. \"In an unprecedented move - the Fed nor the BoJ have yet dared to do so - the ECB has dropped its deposit facility rate into negative territory. With inflation peristently low (but no apparent threat of deflation), the ECB is attempting to spur banks' lending habits by in essence charging a fee for keeping excess reserves parked at the ECB. Whether or not the measures have staying power with the Euro are an entirely different story: President Draghi indicated that rates were at the lower bound. For all intents and purposes, Draghi carried a big stick, but did not necessarily pack the punch required to keep the Euro in a persistent subdued state.\" And the euro remains stubbornly back where it began the morning, at $1.361. This chart shows the path of eurozone interest rates since the financial crisis began. The main refinancing rate is the equivalent of 'base rate' in Britain, while the deposit rate (now negative) is levied on eurozone banks. It's still quite remarkable that the ECB raised rates, twice, in 2011 to combat inflation fears - even as austerity measures pushed some members into deep recessions. That wasn't on Mario Draghi's watch, though (he took over in late 2011) One for Fawlty Towers fans, from a City fund manager who is sceptical that the EBC's latest package of measures will work: And here's another chart outlining the details of today's moves, from analyst Lorcan Roche Kelly: Trevor Greetham, director of Asset Allocation at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, says the ECB has now \"fired its last shot\" on interest rates with today's cuts. He is also encouraged that the door is open to full-blown money printing: Draghi handsomely beat expectations by adopting all of the measures under discussion and leaving the door open to future Quantitative Easing by way of asset purchases if they need to boost growth further or turn sentiment around in a crisis situation. Here's a handy cheat sheet of what the ECB announced today, and what is still in the 'toolbox': That didn't last long -- the euro has now recovered all its early losses, and is now trading back above $1.36 against the US dollar. Some economists are urging caution over how much impact the ECB's raft of stimulus measures (details here) can really have. Gary Jenkins of LNG Capital says that Mario Draghi \"talked a good game\" as usual, however... \"his impact on business investment, growth and employment in the short term is limited\". Jenkins added that Draghi may have to deliver on his claim that the ECB has more measures at its disposal: In the old days we used to think that central bank action would take some 18 months to feed through to the real economy, but I\u2019m not sure that European politicians have got that much patience. If growth remains low and the unemployment rate remains high then it is likely that there will be calls for further action, specifically QE, in order to try to drive growth and employment. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale is also cautious -- pointing out that the 'broad-based asset-backed securitisation' programme that the ECB flagged up simply doesn't exist yet. It's a long-term project, not a quick fix, he told Bloomberg TV. German banks are really not happy, at all, about the imposition of negative interest rates. They are queuing up to lambast the ECB for failing to protect depositors. The association representing its savings banks has declared that \"savers across Europe will be further alienated and asset values will be destroyed\". While Michael Kemmer, managing director of Germany's association for private banks, doesn't see what the fuss is about: \"We also hardly see any of the deflation danger that is so frequently discussed.\" Presumably he noticed that core inflation in the euro area slumped to just 0.7% in May? More on fastFT. A quick recap. The European Central Bank has announced a string of new measures today, as it ratchets up its efforts to fight the threat of deflation and poor growth. President Mario Draghi unveiled \"a combination of measures ... to support lending to the real economy.\" They include: 1) a new targeted programme that will provide \u20ac400bn of cheap credit to eurozone banks to lend to small firms. 2) \"intensifying preparatory work\" on developing a new market for banks to bundle together (securitise) loans made to small companies. 3) Cutting all the eurozone interest rates -- lowering the headline rate to just 0.15%, and imposing negative interest rates of -0.1% on bank deposits at the ECB. 4) It will also inject liquidity into the financial system by no longer 'sterilising' sovereign bonds bought during the crisis in 2011 and 2012. Draghi also insisted that the ECB has further ammunition if needed, suggesting that full-blown quantitative easing (money-printing) was an option. He declared that: \"If required, we will act swiftly with further monetary policy easing. The Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments within its mandate should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation.\" He later reiterated this point: We've done this. We think it's a significant package. Are we finished? The answer is no! We aren't finished here. If need be, within our mandate, we aren't finished here.\" The move came as the ECB revised down its inflation forecasts, admitting that it will not hit its 2% target in 2016. The eurozone faces a \"prolonged period\" of low inflation (the rate fell to just 0.5% in May). Financial markets initially welcomed the news, with shares jumping across Europe and the euro falling from $1.36 to $1.3504, before clawing its way back to $1.358. During a lively press conference -- Draghi defended the ECB's decision to become the first major central bank to experiment with negative interest rates. He denied that savings are being \"expropriated\", and pledged that interest rates will go up when the economy has recovered. He said the European election results are a signal to 'think deeply' about the nature of Europe, which must deliver growth and jobs as well as peace. And he warned that Europe's economy remains fragile, and \"the risks surrounding growth prospects continue to be on the downside.\" The ECB has now issued its own Q&amp;A, explaining why it has introduced a negative interest rate on banks in the euro area. Why has the ECB introduced a negative interest rate? It includes the claim that the move will help savers, by supporting growth so that rates can eventually rise.... And that's the end of the ECB press conference - on a landmark day for the eurozone, and in the history of the financial crisis that began almost seven years ago. Summary and reaction to follow..... Q: How worried are you, Mr Draghi, about the rise of far-right and extremist parties in the European Parliament elections? The ECB president makes three points: 1) Most informed analysts believe the Parliament can still function as in the past, despite the election results. 2) It's important to acknowledge that diverse views is an expression of democracy, and that \"should be welcomed\" 3) It is a reason to think deeply about how we can improve Europe, and deliver not only peace - which is no small achievement - but also prosperity and jobs. Q: What impact will ultra-loose monetary policy in the developed world have on emerging markets? Draghi says the IMF is the only institution which can put in place a facility which would help emerging markets cope with spillovers - and work is underway. How long is medium-term, exactly?.... Draghi says the ECB is confident that the measures announced today will \"help drive inflation to 2% over the medium term\". It's been a pretty assured performance from Super Mario - who gets more credit than anyone else for holding the eurozone together. Q: Could the euro fall back to the levels when it launched? Draghi replies that the euro exchange rate is not a target, but it's very important -- and the recent strengthening is one factor that has pushed down inflation Q: Is France doing enough on structural reforms, and do you agree with comparisons between the new French prime minister and Italy's Matteo Renzi? Draghi elegantly resists swishing at this mischievous question -- he's not about to start comparing various elected leaders. #shame But on the broader point - governments understand the need to keep reforming their economies. Q: Are you worried that the European Parliamentary elections will deter national governments from sticking with structural reforms? Our package is not a disincentive for reforms. Our mandate is to deliver price stability, Draghi replies - we will do everything needed. This new package is separate from the political situation. And no, we are not completely comfortable about the degree of reforms to date. Draghi also explains that government's cannot simply hike taxes to consolidate their budgets - they need structural reforms too. Q: A German banking body has accused the ECB of expropriating savers' money. What is your message to German savers who suffer from such low interest rates? On the first point, Draghi says there is a misunderstanding about the negative interest rates. The ECB is NOT imposing negative rates on deposit holders, but commercial banks (on their deposits at the ECB). Commercial banks may choose to charge savers' deposits rather than paying an interest rate, but that's their decision not the ECBs. And on the second point, savers' concerns should be taken very seriously. Interest rates will go up when the recovery comes back, when growth comes back, he adds. What else is left in the toolbox? Draghi reiterates that the ECB isn't exhausted. A broad-based asset purchasing programme is certainly one instrument still available. Q: Why is this LTRO different than before -- and is the Governing Council fully united behind it ? Draghi repeats that today's decisions were fully unanimous -- indeed, there was an unusual degree of consensus. And the new \u20ac400bn LTRO, which he dubs a \"TLTRO\", is different because banks cannot use it to buy sovereign government debt. They must use the \u20ac400bn of cheap credit on offer to lend to small companies. Q: How worried is the ECB that inflation fell to just 0.5% in May? Draghi replies that the Bank still doesn't see a self-sustaining deflationary spiral. It doesn't see households and firms putting off purchases because they'll be cheaper in future. He also points out that falling energy costs are a factor driving down inflation, along with weak demand. Not much has changed in causes of low inflation. But we reacted to long period of low inflation, he concludes. Q: How long will it take for these measures to help the eurozone economy? That's hard question, Draghi smiles, because today's decision is in three parts 1) easing the monetary stance (cutting rates) 2) enhance transmission to the economy 3) And a commitment to use further unconventional measures if needed On part 1, Draghi says that interest rates will stay low for an extended period, \"maybe longer than before\" &lt;- effectively HARDENING the ECB's forward guidance. We should see immediate effects in the money market, and delayed impact on the real economy..... probably taking three or four quarters. Q: how much work have you done on scoping out an Asset-Backed Securities programme? We did not scope it out, beyond agreeing some key elements. Namely: Focused on the non-financial part of the economy, \"simple\" -- nothing 'squared, or cubed' (a reference to the complicated derivatives that helped crash the global system in 2008) It should also be \"real\" and \"transparent\" Q: Why didn't you just do QE, given the weak eurozone inflation outlook? Draghi replies that \"We think this is a significant package, but we are not finished here..... Within our mandate, we are not finished here So a broad-based asset purchasing programme is still possible. Q: Why has the ECB suspended its policy of 'sterilising' bond purchases made during 2012? We are in a different place than before, Draghi replies. With low inflation and low growth, it's the right decision now. First questions: Could interest rates be cut further? Draghi replies that we have now reached the 'lower bound'; borrowing costs cannot really be cut again (although he's not ruling out some tweaks). How will the ECB ensure that banks use the new \u20ac400bn LTRO programme to actually stimulate the eurozone economy? There will be additional, enhanced reporting measures, Draghi replies. We want to enhance lending to the non-financial part of the private sector. There will be checks on how banks use the initial slug of cash available through the LTRO just announced, and on further injections. Draghi adds that he has looked at other banks' programme, such as the Bank of England (Funding For Lending). Onto the Q&amp;A.... The instant concensus is that Mario Draghi has, once again, come up with the goods. Here's the new inflation expectations -- showing that it does not get back to the 2% target anytime soon... 0.7% in 2014, 1.1% in 2015, 1.4% in 2016. Mario Draghi's full statement is now online here. Here's Reuters early take on Mario Draghi's announcements: The European Central Bank said on Thursday it will offer banks a targeted long-term refinancing operation (LTRO) to persuade them to lend, was preparing to purchase asset-backed securities in future and will discontinue sterilising previous bond purchases. The decision came after the ECB had cut its main interest rate to 0.15 percent and imposed negative interest rates on banks' overnight deposit. The measures are designed to offer the euro zone economy stimulus, but stop short of the large-scale effect the ECB could unleash with a big plan of quantitative easing (QE) - money printing to buy assets. \"In pursuing our price stability mandate today we decided on a combination of measures to provide additional monetary policy accommodation and to support lending to the real economy,\" ECB President Mario Draghi told a news conference On inflation, Draghi warns that it will remain low for the coming months, and only rise slowly in 2015 and 2016 towards the ECB target of close to, but below 2%. This underpins today's decision, he insists. The ECB has revised its economic forecasts.. with Draghi warning that risks are still \"to the downside\" It now expects growth of just 1.0% this year, down from 1.2% before. But it expects growth of 1.7% in 2015, up from 1.5% before. The forecast for 2016 is unchanged at 1.8% The Italian stock market has jumped. Draghi reiterates that the governing council has agreed to \"intensify\" its preparatory work on the 'asset-backed security' market. That means creating a system where commercial banks can combine their small business loans into a new security, and then sell it on -- perhaps to the ECB? This is big. Draghi is outlining the terms of a new Long-Term Refinancing Operation - designed to help banks lend to small companies and help the \"real economy\". It will be \u20ac400bn in total, and priced at a mere 10 basis points over the refinancing rate (now just 0.15%) Banks will be able to borrow up to 7% of the total value of their loans to the 'non-financial' parts of the economy, and they can't use mortgage lending either. The euro is tumbling further on the news that the ECB has agreed new measures to stimulate the eurozone economy, to $1.351. And the German DAX has shot through the 10,000 mark. Today's decisions were unanimous, Draghi says. So, no opposition from the Bundesbank. Draghi says the governing council is unanimous in its commitment to using all unconventional measures available to meet its mandate. Draghi says the ECB has agreed a combination of measures to stimulate the eurozone economy. That includes the interest rate cuts. BUT that is not all! The governing council has agreed new \"targetted long-term refinancing operations\". It has also agreed to undergo \"Preparatory work\" on buying asset-backed securities And they have suspended the sterilisation of the bonds it bought during the crisis in 2012. The ECB press conference is beginning now. ECB president Mario Draghi is about to begin his press conference, explaining why the central bank cut interest rates today. He will surely be quizzed on what 'additional measures' are lined up.... Here's the live feed. (if you open it in a new tab you can keep this blog running too) The interest rates (or yield) on bonds issued by Spain, Italy Greece and Ireland are falling following the ECB's decision to ease monetary policy again. This has pulled the yield on Ireland's 10-year bonds to just 2.59%, below America's 10-year Treasury bills for the first time since 2007. Germany's banking industry is not impressed by the ECB's decision to impose negative interest rates on banks today. The FT's Alice Ross reports: A quick recap for those just joining us: The European Central Bank has cut borrowing costs across the eurozone, a historic move which means commercial banks will have to pay it to deposit funds at the ECB. The ECB acted this afternoon after seeing inflation fall to just 0.5% in May, further from its target of close to 2%. The move cuts the main refinancing rate in the euro area to just 0.15% - a fresh record low. And commercial banks will face a negative interest rate of -.10% on their deposits (see our Q&amp;A to learn more about negative rates) The ECB has promised to announce \" Further monetary policy measures\" at 2.30pm BST /3.30pm Frankfurt time. That has sent the euro falling against the US dollar to $1.357, down 0.2% today. There is speculation that those measures could include a new programme to help banks lend to small businesses. Mario Draghi, the ECB president, will begin a press conference in 20 minutes time.... Stay tuned for live coverage and reaction.... Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, expects that the ECB will announce a new bank funding programme this afternoon. It may be modelled on the Bank of England's \"Funding for lending programme\" -- which let commercial banks borrow very cheaply from the BoE, as long as they passed the money onto customers. ING analyst Carsten Brzeski writes that the ECB has entered \"uncharted territory\" by imposing negative interest rates on eurozone banks who deposit funds at the Central bank, rather than lending it. But Brzeski doesn't reckon it will have a massive impact on its own -- Mario Draghi will have to announce more measures at the press conference in 25 minutes: Will it help to kick-start the economy? Probably not, but at least it demonstrate the ECB\u2019s determination and ability to act. At the press conference starting at 2.30 pm CET, we will know whether the ECB only delivered a bare minimum or whether we will have to cite German poet Wilhelm Busch: this was the initial trick, but the second follows quick. Credit Agricole's Frederik Ducrozet reckons that European Central Bank will shortly announce a new programme designed to encourage eurozone banks to lend to small firms: Some instant reaction: The euro lurched around dramatically as the European Central Bank's decision to cut interest rates hit the wires. It initially jumped from $1.36 to \u00a31.363, then fell sharply to $1.355 as the ECB revealed that it would announce \"further policy decisions' this afternoon.... Here's the full statement from the European Central Bank - confirming that it has cut the headline interest rate to a new record low of 0.15%, and also imposed negative interest rates of -0.1% on eurozone banks -- to encourage them to lend to small firms rather than to hoard cash. 5 June 2014 - Monetary policy decisions The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be decreased by 10 basis points to 0.15%, starting from the operation to be settled on 11 June 2014. The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be decreased by 35 basis points to 0.40%, with effect from 11 June 2014. The interest rate on the deposit facility will be decreased by 10 basis points to -0.10%, with effect from 11 June 2014. A separate press release to be published at 3.30 p.m. CET today will provide details on the implementation of the negative deposit facility rate. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 2.30 p.m. CET today. Further monetary policy measures to enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism will be communicated in a press release to be published at 3.30 p.m. CET today. The ECB says it will announce \"further monetary policy measures\" this afternoon. Could that be a new funding programme to help banks lend to small firms? Breaking: The European Central Bank has cut the refinancing rate, the headline interest rate across the eurozone, to 0.15% from 0.25%. And it has also taken the historic decision to impose negative interest rates on the region's banks. It cut the deposit rate to -0.1% from 0.0%. Tension is mounting as we tick down towards the ECB decision. Will it become the first major central bank to impose negative interest rates on its banks? We've had the Bank of England's freezing - now onto the European Central Bank's easing?..... That's certainly what Credit Agricole hopes for, telling clients that: \"It's time for the ECB to deliver.\" And the consensus in the financial markets is that the ECB will announce interest rate cuts, and a new Long-Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) to help banks lend to small businesses. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities reckons the ECB will shy away from the radical option of quantitative easing (effectively money-printing) Outright QE does not appear to be an option that is being considered for June, above all due to the fact that the European Court of Justice has still to rule on the legality of the OMT programme [details here] Just 25 minutes to go.... Cue a scramble to City sandwich bars before the ECB announces its own decision on interest rates (and who knows what else?....) at 12.45pm BST/1.45pm CEST. The Bank of England's decision to leave UK borrowing costs unchanged has caused precisely no excitement in the City. The minutes of the meeting, released in two week's time, will be more interesting I reckon, as pressure builds on the BoE to consider raising borrowing costs.... The Bank of England has left UK interest rates unchanged at their record low of 0.5%. There's also no change to its QE programme. And no statement. Germany's finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has reportedly said this morning that the eurozone's current ultra-low (and getting lower?) interest rates are only a temporary response to the region's economic challenges. He's not telling the ECB what to do, though.... Over in Greece, the IMF has whipped up a storm of controversy with its unexplained decision to delay a much anticipated (and what many believe will be highly critical) review of the economic progress the debt-stricken country has made. Helena Smith, our correspondent in Athens, reports. The IMF\u2019s fifth review of Greece\u2019s fiscal adjustment programme was meant to be released last night. But without any official explanation the Washington-based body has held off, causing much head-scratching in Athens that the report may in fact be postponed until after a government reshuffle when the technocrat finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, is expected to be replaced (although by who, yet, no one quite knows). It is hoped that IMF spokesman Gerry Rice will help solve the mystery when he gives his daily briefing tonight. Reports are swirling in the Greek media that the review will be highly critical in its critique of the country\u2019s ability to dig itself out of its financial mess \u2013 raising the alarm over the \u20ac2bn fiscal shortfall Athens could soon face and the funding gap it is almost certain to encounter (\u20ac13bn at least) between 2015-16. Unlike Greece\u2019s other creditors at the EU and ECB, the IMF has also taken a much tougher line on the sustainability of Greece\u2019s \u20ac320bn euro debt mountain. Speculation is mounting that the organization may even raise the prospect of inflicting a Cypriot-style haircut on Greek bank depositors to redress the situation. If so, yikes! The Greeks don't have that British \"let's sit down and take it\" cool of their Greek Cypriot cousins. Financial markets are nervously waiting to see what the European Central Bank announces in under one hour's time (12.45pm BST), followed by the press conference 45 minutes later. There is broad expectation that the ECB will cut interest rates today. That would include imposing 'negative rates' (Q&amp;A here) on eurozone banks. Many economists believe the ECB could also announce unconventional policy measures; perhaps a new funding programme to push banks into lending to SME. But no-one's really sure how far the governing council can, or will, move today. As Alistair Cotton, corporate dealer at Currencies Direct, explains: \u201cThe European central bank is expected to cut interest rates, including taking its deposit rate into negative territory. The ECB will be the first major central bank to try negative deposit rates, so we are moving into uncharted waters from a market perspective. Nobody is quite sure how different markets will react to the move. The Euro is weakening ahead of the announcement with GBP/EUR pair the one to watch given the continuation of good data flow from the UK. \u201cAlthough the ECB dropped hints about a change in policy this month it is still unclear if any further easing measures will also be announced alongside a cut in rates. Mario Draghi suggested outright QE was an option at last month\u2019s meeting, but it is unlikely that the ECB would be able to undertake sovereign bond buying at such short notice. The ECB may instead announce a program to support asset back securities markets, to free up an important funding tool for banks and risk transfer tool for investors and borrowers or it may a try similar plan to the Bank of England\u2019s funding for lending scheme, where banks use central bank funding to lend to business.\u201d The ECB has 5 options in the toolkit: Cut interest rates Offer eurozone banks more cheap credit, for them to lend to small firms Inject more liquidity by stop 'sterilising' the bond purchases it made in 2012 Buy 'securitised' bundles of SME loans from the banking sector Launch full-blown quantitative easing The euro is hovering around \u20ac1.36 to the US dollar --- but could move dramatically once the news breaks.... Jeroen Dijsselbloem also told CNBC this morning that the European Central Bank can't be expected to solve the eurozone problems on its own. From the transcript: Q: But don\u2019t you think that whatever\u2019s coming from the ECB today or over the next couple of months is simply too little too late? Dijsselbloem: If you listen to some of the expectations that some of the commentators have shown over the last couple of days, they will probably be disappointed anyway because no way can you deliver such big results in such short time. What the ECB can do will help I\u2019m sure but it cannot just come from the ECB. National governments and joint co-operation in the euro group has to stay strong to do the work that we have to do \u2013 we ministers. There is an unhealthy level of expectations on the European Central Bank today. So warns Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who also chairs the eurogroup of finance ministers. Speaking in London, Dijsselbloem also declared that he \"strongly\" believes that the UK should remain in the EU. Here's the wire snaps: 11:06 - EUROGROUP HEAD DIJSSELBLOEM-MAIN WORRY ABOUT EUROSCEPTIC RESULTS IN EURO ELECTIONS IS THAT POLITICIANS WILL EASE OFF ON REFORMS 11:10 - EUROGROUP HEAD DIJSSELBLOEM-EXPECTATIONS FOR ECB ACTION TODAY VERY HIGH, THAT IS NOT A HEALTHY THING 11:13 - EUROGROUP HEAD DIJSSELBLOEM-I AM A STRONG BELIEVER THAT THE UK NEEDS TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION Sony Kapoor of the Re-Define thinktank agrees that merely cutting eurozone interest rates won't achieve much: Here's what \"Super\" Mario Draghi's toolbox of monetary policy weapons might look like: (you might need to refresh, sorry) Kit Juckes of Societe Generale predicts a three-pronged attack from the ECB today. Cutting the main refinancing rate to just 0.1%, and imposing a negative interest rate of -0.1% on bank deposits at the ECB A targeted injection of liquidity - ie, cheap credit to banks, for them to pass onto small business customers A small (\u20ac300bn) private sector asset buying programme -- to buy 'bundles' of SME loans, again to encourage banks to lend. The euro has been creeping upwards this morning, gaining 0.13% against the US dollar to \u20ac1.361. Interest rate cuts are already priced in by traders -- what's not clear is whether the ECB takes the plunge into more unconventional measures (details). Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, explains: \"Delivering stimulus beyond a move into negative territory on the deposit rate \u2013 such as another round of LTROs or QE-style asset purchases \u2013 is likely to send the Euro sharply lower. An outcome in line with forecasts may apply initial downward pressure but follow-through could be limited in as much as investors have already priced it in. Indeed, a relief rally may ensue as hopes for bolder action fizzle. ITV's Richard Edgar isn't holding back on the excitement: Jane Foley, Rabobank's foreign exchange expert, warns that Mario Draghi must announce decisive measures today - simply cutting borrowing costs won't be enough. There is a \"tangible\" risk that the ECB will fail to meet expectations, she says: We are of the view that Draghi will have to announce a variety of other measures today and potentially strengthen his forward guidance if he is to be successful in both enhancing the transition of monetary policy and in avoiding disappointing the market. Foley also isn't convinced that imposing negative interest rates on eurozone banks (one of the options in the toolbox) will do much good: On balance it is difficult to be optimistic that negative interest rates will have a strong and lasting impact either on materially weakening the EUR or in pushing cheap loans to the SMEs in need of it. The latest Greek unemployment data is out, and confirms that the country is still racked by desperately high joblessness. Elstat reports that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in March 2014 was 26.8%. It also revised up the joblessness rate for February to 26.9%, from a previous estimate of 26.5%. Youth unemployment was also desperately high, with 58.3% of 15-24 year olds out of work. This chart shows how Greece's unemployment rate has remained little changed over the last year: Elstat also reports that almost as many people are 'inactive' as 'employed' in Greece, on top of the official 'unemployed'. Employed in March: 3,482,345, up by 11,857 compared with February Unemployed in March: 1,274,843, down by 1,466 compared with February Inactive in March: 3,393,042, down by 14,859 compared with February (that suggests the total Greek population fell during the month - a trend that began in 2012, according to Elstat) Just in -- eurozone retail sales rose in April, and by more than expected. Eurostat reports that the volume of retail sale increased by 0.4% month-on-month in April, beating forecasts of just 0.1% growth. On an annual basis, sales volumes were up by 2.4%. This year's late Easter is probably a factor here (in 2013 it fell in March). Although I'm reminded of Mario Draghi's infamous quote from 12 months ago: The fact that inflation is low is not, by itself, bad; with low inflation, you can buy more stuff. It is \"inevitable\" that the ECB will act today, says analysts at Daiwa Capital Markets. They point out that eurozone inflation slumped last month; at just 0.5%, it's a long way from the ECB's target. The third month of pronounced undershooting of inflation in May \u2013 this time clearly visible in core inflation \u2013 as well as ongoing falls in credit and high bank lending interest rates in the southern periphery, the case for action is irrefutable. Daiwa predict interest rate cuts, and a new injection of funding to eurozone banks (a Long Term Refinancing Operation, in central bank jargon), focused at lending to small businesses. A new, conditional LTRO akin to the BoE\u2019s Funding-for-Lending scheme and BoJ\u2019s Stimulating Lending Facility seems likely, tying the provision of 4-year fixed-rate funding to new credit provision to the private sector. A QE programme is unlikely, though, they reckon. There's been a lot of chatter about the negative interest rates on eurozone banks, but what would that mean? The logic is that banks will be keener to lend to customers if they are forced to pay to leave their money in the ECB's electronic vaults instead. At present, the deposit rate is 0.0%. No major central bank has tried negative interest -- and as our Q&amp;A shows, there are fears it would cause \"unpredictable and unintended consequences\". Might banks impose higher charges on customers to cover the cost of negative rates, or be driven to buy riskier, high-yielding assets? Or could they be put off from gathering deposits at all? Q&amp;A: what are negative interest rates? So, what might the ECB do today? Effectively there are five tools in the monetary policy toolbox which it could grasp.... and my colleague Katie Allen has rounded them up here: Cut interest rates (both the headline rate of 0.25%, and the 0.0% rate paid on bank deposits at the ECB -- which would herald negative interest rates) A new programme for bank lending, perhaps fashioned like the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme which provided cheaper credit to banks. It could inject more liquidity into the system by stopping 'sterilising' bond purchases it made during the eurozone crisis in 2012 Reviving the asset backed securities market -- to help banks package up SME loans into packages which can be told on (but with tighter controls than in the run-up to the financial crisis) A full-blown QE programme -- printing euros to expand the money supply and drive inflation up Or it could do nothing.... Here's Katie's full piece: European Central Bank prepares to act - what are its options? Back to the big story of the day: whether or not the European Central Bank takes decisive action today to drag the eurozone away deflation and stagnation (see opening post for the details) With the governing council hard at work in Frankfurt, the WSJ's Richard Barley points out that it will be 'unprecedented' for any major central bank impose a negative interest rate on commercial banks who lodge cash with it. Barley also acknowledges that Draghi's words at the press conference (1.30pm BST) will probably as significant as whatever the ECB actually decides.... Britain's car industry has recorded its longest ever period of sales growth, after posting a 7.7% increase in new vehicle sales last month. That breaks the previous record set in the mid-1980s, according to the SMMT's monthly survey of the sector. Here's the key points from the SMMT (more here) May increase drives UK new car market to 27 consecutive months of growth, breaking record set in the late 1980s. New car registrations increased 7.7% in May to 194,032 units \u2013 the most in May since 2004. Registrations for 2014-to-date pass the one million mark, rising 11.6% to 1,058,974 units. In the UK, the Brazilian real has been flying out of foreign exchange outlets faster than Raheem Sterling as World Cup fever mounts. According to BBC Radio 5, Travelex and the Post Office are running short of Brazil's currency: Travelex has run out of the currency at Heathrow and Manchester airports, after demand rose more than 1,000%. Meanwhile the Post Office, which offers travel money at 11,500 branches nationwide, says it won't have the Real until the weekend. It says demand is up 400% on last year. More here: Post Office and Travelex run out of Brazilian currency Speculation of a takeover has pushed shares in Smith &amp; Nephew, the UK medical equipment supplier, up 4% this morning. Overnight, Bloomberg reported that US rival Medtronic is considering a bid for S&amp;N. This makes Medtronic the second suiter -- Stryker was forced to rule itself out for six months after fastFT reported that it had hired bankers to consider a bid for S&amp;N. This morning's tumble means ASOS's shares have more than halved in value since February: Perhaps Britain's housing boom isn't running out of steam after all.... Halifax has reported this morning that prices surged by 3.9% in May alone, a much bigger rise than expected. That reverses the falls which Halifax reported in March and April - and means prices are 8.7% higher than a year ago. Stephen Noakes, Halifax's mortgages director, says low interest rates and falling unemployment are boosting consumer confidence: Housing demand is still strong and continues to be supported by a strengthening economic recovery. Asos's shocker of a profits warning has hit high street and online retailers across the stock market. Sports Direct are down 1.9%, Next dipped by 1.4%, SuperGroup has shed 4.5% and Ocado has fallen by 3%. Shares in ASOS, the online fashion retailer, have suddenly fallen out fashion after it shocked the stock market with a profits warning. The stock tumbled 40% at the start of trading, wiping around \u00a31.5bn off its value, after it cautioned investors that its profit margins will be around 4.5%, not 6.5% as expected. It blamed the strength of the pound for hitting profits from overseas, and price-cutting by rivals. As CEO Nick Robertson put it: Our profit performance for this financial year is not what we had hoped for due to an unusual combination of factors... before adding that the firm's 'accelerated' investment in technology and infrastructure is on track. That's not enough to stop the flood of sell orders, though.... The Bank of England's monetary policy committee is also meeting today, but it'll be playing second fiddle to the ECB. The BoE isn't expected to change borrowing costs today -- the minutes of the meeting, released in 2 weeks time, will show whether any MPC members are ready to raise rates. \"The prospect of a crazy hour in financial markets is high\", warns IG's Chris Weston. That's because while investors have priced in an interest rate cut, there's much more uncertainty over what 'unconventional' measures might be announced -- or simply hinted at -- in Draghi's press conference. Weston adds: Mario Draghi holds all the cards. Don\u2019t underestimate the ECB president\u2019s power of surprise, and after guiding the market into pricing in action over the last month, Mr Draghi could easily say something that is new news and needs to be in the price. Mario Draghi stoked our expectations at last month's press conference by declaring that the governing council was 'comfortable' with acting in June, once its staff had prepared the latest economic forecasts. The euro has weakened by two cents against the US dollar since then, in anticipation of action. Which means we could see some wild swings if the ECB doesn't take decisive action today. As Guy Johnson of Bloomberg TV puts \"If they don't deliver, do we get a pop towards $1.40?\" Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and business. The Big Day has finally arrived. Over in Frankfurt, the European Central Bank's top executives and central bank chiefs from across the eurozone are gathering for the ECB's monthly governing council meeting. They must decide whether to take fresh action to stimulate the eurozone's flagging economy, in the face of low inflation and lacklustre growth. Most economists believe that the ECB will swing into action today -- but will it unleash enough firepower to make a difference? There's a number of tools at the ECB's disposal - the most obvious being slashing borrowing costs. They could lop a bit off the main interest rate (currently just 0.25%), but the real drama would come if they imposed negative interest rates on the eurozone banking sector to force them to lend. More radical options are available -- perhaps a fresh liquidity programme to douse the eurozone financial sector in cheap money. Or a new scheme to encourage lending to small businesses in the euro area. Or even - and this would be a milestone in the financial crisis - some kind of quantitative easing, to mop up assets with newly minted euros. Such a QE programme would probably buy packages of small business loans from eurozone banks. So, drama ahead - although not for several hours. The ECB announces its decision on monetary policy at 12.45 BST, or 13.45 Frankfurt time. Governor Mario Draghi's press conference comes 45 minutes later. Draghi's press conference is always a Must-Watch event, and today's one could be quite special. I'll be tracking the build-up to the decision, and then covering the press conference and the aftermath....",

      "bodyText": "General Motors\u2019 fatal delay in recalling cars with faulty ignition switches was caused by a \u201cpattern of incompetence and neglect\u201d, chief executive Mary Barra said Thursday. Announcing the findings of an internal report, Barra said she had fired 15 people and disciplined another five for the decade-long delay that has been linked to at least 13 fatal crashes and eventually led to the recall of 2.6m Chevrolet Cobalts, Saturn Ions and other models equipped with faulty ignition switches. The car giant\u2019s actions come after Barra received a report from former US attorney Anton Valukas into the ignition scandal. The recall has also triggered a federal investigation, congressional hearings and a flurry of lawsuits from family members of people killed in cars with faulty switches. Those lawyers claim the death count is far higher than GM\u2019s estimated 13. Valukas\u2019s report has now been given to federal regulators and Congress. In April, Barra, a lifelong GM employee, was grilled about her knowledge of the fault by a House committee. She denied having any prior involvement. Valukas\u2019s report, which covered more than 350 interviews with over 230 individuals and more than 41m documents, cleared Barra and other senior executives of any direct involvement in the recall delay. It found no evidence of a conspiracy by the corporation to cover up the facts. Nor did the report conclude that employees had made a trade-off between safety and cost. During April\u2019s often heated congressional hearing, Barra was repeatedly quizzed about the delay in upgrading the ignition switches \u2013 which cost 57\u00a2 a car. Democrat Diana DeGette said that GM elected not to replace the part because of the lack of \"an acceptable business case\" for doing so. In a statement, Barra said she wanted to \u201ctake this opportunity to again express my deepest sympathies to the families that lost loved ones and to those who were injured\u201d. Barra said the report had uncovered \u201ca pattern of incompetence and neglect\u201d. \u201cRepeatedly, individuals failed to disclose critical pieces of information that could have fundamentally changed the lives of those impacted by a faulty ignition switch. If this information had been disclosed, I believe in my heart the company would have dealt with this matter appropriately,\u201d she said. \u201cFurthermore, numerous individuals did not accept any responsibility to drive our organization to understand what was truly happening. The report highlights a company that operated in silos, with a number of individuals seemingly looking for reasons not to act, instead of finding ways to protect our customers,\u201d she added. Barra outlined five of the reports key findings: GM personnel's inability to address the ignition switch problem, which persisted for more than 11 years, represents a history of failures. While everybody who was engaged on the ignition switch issue had the responsibility to fix it, nobody took responsibility. Throughout the entire 11-year history, there was no demonstrated sense of urgency, even until the end. The ignition switch issue was touched by numerous parties at \u2013 engineers, investigators, lawyers \u2013 but nobody raised the problem to the highest levels of the company. Overall, the report concludes that from start to finish the Cobalt saga was riddled with failures, which led to tragic results for many. \u201cI hate sharing this with you as much as you hate hearing it. But I want you to hear it. In fact, I never want you to forget it. This is not just another business crisis for GM. We aren't simply going to fix this and move on. We are going to fix the failures in our system \u2013 that I promise. In fact, many are already fixed. And we are going to do the right thing for the affected parties,\u201d she said. Barra is expected to appear before Congress for the second time soon. House energy and commerce committee chairman Fred Upton said Thursday he had spoken to Barra after the report\u2019s release and she \u201cassured me that she would come back to testify about the report and answer outstanding questions.\" Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond\u2019s school of law said members were unlikely to be persuaded by this report after the last heated sessions. \u201cThe report appears very comprehensive but it doesn\u2019t tell us a lot that we didn\u2019t already know,\u201d he said. Barra has announced that attorney Kenneth Feinberg, known for handling high-profile victim compensation cases, will handle a compensation fund for victims of the ignition switches. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know who will be compensated or what those people will need to show,\u201d he said. GM emerged from bankruptcy in 2008 and is technically a different company from the one that installed the faulty switches. Tobias said there were still major questions about the extent that bankruptcy laws will protect GM from lawsuits. \u201cThis story is far from over,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "G4S security guards have violently removed more than a dozen protesting shareholders from the company's annual meeting . Protesters, who bought shares in the firm in order to attend the meeting, were dragged out of the conference room in the Excel Centre, London, on Thursday after speaking out about its role supplying Israeli prisons and the death of an Angolan man while he was being deported by G4S guards. One protester who had attached herself to a chair was manhandled by four security guards. \"You are hurting me, you are hurting me,\" she said as she was dragged from the meeting. A leaflet she left behind said: \"We are here because G4S helps governments across the world to violate basic human rights. \"We want to remind you that the huge salaries your board earns and the dividends that your shareholders pocket are only possible because of the extreme human suffering that G4S inflicts.\" Another protester was violently evicted by two guards after he spoke out about the death of Angolan national Jimmy Mubenga. \"Shame on G4S from making illegal deportations. Who killed Jimmy Mubenga?\" John Connolly, the firm's chairman, banned the Guardian from tweeting or live reporting from the meeting. G4S security guards prevented shareholders from taking photographs or videos of the violent removal of protesters. A shareholder interrupted proceedings to question the board about the violent removal of protesters. He said: \"This cannot be acceptable.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "European Central Bank prepares to act - what are its options?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank is widely expected to take action on Thursday to tackle low inflation in the eurozone and shore up the bloc's recovery. Mario Draghi has come under intense pressure to act and the latest inflation data published this week has added to the momentum. An unexpected fall in annual inflation to 0.5% in May, from 0.7% in April, has sharpened the threat of deflation, which is considered an even more serious economic threat than hyper-inflation. Further weight was was added to the argument for a rate change came on Wednesday, as the EU's statistical body confirmed that eurozone GDP grew by just 0.2% in the first three months of 2014. Deflation could also increase the burden of the high lpublic debt that stalks the eurozone. The easing of already ultra-loose monetary policy, with the ECB's key interest rate already standing at 0.25%, is awaited not least because Draghi said at last month's meeting that policymakers were \"comfortable with acting next time\". Negative deposit rates have also been mooted. But what will they do? Most economists expect a whole package of measures, including at least some of the following options: 1 Interest rate cuts This is widely expected. Borrowing costs in the eurozone are already close to zero but Draghi will go further. The ECB's key refinancing rate \u2013 the rate at which commercial banks can borrow from Frankfurt \u2013 is currently 0.25% and a cut to 0.15% is widely predicted. Of greater interest will be what Draghi does to the deposit rate, or the interest banks get when they lodge money with the ECB. The strong speculation is that at this week's meeting it will become the first major central bank in the world to announce a negative rate, probably -0.1%. That means is that it will cost banks money to deposit money at the ECB. The hope is that they will lend the money out instead. 2 Support for more lending The ECB may announce more targeted steps to boost lending, especially in some of the weaker countries on the eurozone's periphery. Here, the ECB is likely to come up with its own version of the Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme, which gave banks access to cheaper credit but only on the condition that it was lent rather than hoarded. In the past, the ECB has used long-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to provide help to eurozone banks. A more targeted LTRO looks likely this week. 3 Stop sterilising Another way to get more money flowing around would be to stop \"sterilising\" bond purchases made during the height of the eurozone crisis under the ECB's now-terminated Securities Markets Program (SMP). Until now, sterilising has meant the central bank offsets the purchases it made of bonds of some troubled peripheral countries. This means it does not simply increase the money supply as a result of the bond purchases \u2013 which is known as quantitative easing. Instead the ECB has been taking the equivalent amount of money out from other parts of the system. It has been doing this by offering banks the chance to park money with it equal in value to the government bonds it still holds. Some economists propose to stop this weekly draining of money from the financial system. 4 Reviving the asset backed securities market The ECB and the BoE have been talking about getting more money flowing to businesses by reviving the market for asset backed securities (ABS), where mortgages, loans or other debts are bundled up and sold on to other investors. The asset class was widely denounced as \"toxic sludge\" for their role in causing the global financial crisis but central bankers are keen to move to a new market with better vetting of the securities and Draghi could announce something in this area. 5 Printing money This is seen as unlikely for now, but some economists see full-blown quantitative easing somewhere along the road as the ECB fends of the threat of deflation. QE, whereby a central bank pumps electronic money into the financial system by buying up assets, has already been tried by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan. The latest eurozone data on Tuesday this week showed inflation was, at 0.5%, well below the ECB's target of just under 2%. But most economists say the picture would have to worsen considerably before QE becomes a likelihood. \"We remain doubtful that the ECB will undertake full blown quantitative easing. We suspect this will only happen if eurozone consumer price inflation heads falls to new lows below 0.5% over the coming months and eurozone growth falters further,\" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. 6 Do nothing While analysts and investors are convinced Draghi and his colleagues will act on Thursday the ECB has a final option: do nothing. Draghi has, after all, proved to be highly skilled at moving markets through words alone and without actually doing anything. His dramatic statement in July 2012 that the central bank would do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro is widely credited as bringing to an end the worst phase of the region's crisis, amid elevated investor fears the currency bloc was on the verge of collapse. \"Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough,\" he famously declared at an investment conference in London. \"We think the euro is irreversible.\" Equity markets were immediately boosted, the euro strengthened, and sky high government borrowing costs in Spain and Italy came down, buying those under-pressure economies some much needed time. The statement marked the turning point in the eurozone crisis, and Draghi didn't have to cut rates or buy a single bond to achieve it.",

      "body": "<p>The European Central Bank is widely expected to take action on Thursday to tackle low inflation in the eurozone and shore up the bloc's recovery. Mario Draghi has come under intense pressure to act and the latest inflation data published this week has added to the momentum.</p> <p>An unexpected fall in annual inflation to 0.5% in May, from 0.7% in April, has sharpened the threat of deflation, which is considered an even more serious economic threat than hyper-inflation. Further weight was was added to the argument for a rate change came on Wednesday, as the EU's statistical body confirmed that eurozone GDP grew by just 0.2% in the first three months of 2014.</p> <p>Deflation could also increase the burden of the high lpublic debt that stalks the eurozone. The easing of already ultra-loose monetary policy, with the ECB's key interest rate already standing at 0.25%, is awaited not least because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/26/mario-draghi-hints-at-ecb-rate-cut-to-avoid-deflation\" title=\"\">Draghi said at last month's meeting</a> that policymakers were \"comfortable with acting next time\". Negative deposit rates have also been mooted.</p> <p>But what will they do? Most economists expect a whole package of measures, including at least some of the following options:</p> <h2>1 <strong>Interest rate cuts</strong></h2> <p>This is widely expected. Borrowing costs in the eurozone are already close to zero but Draghi will go further. The ECB's key refinancing rate \u2013 the rate at which commercial banks can borrow from Frankfurt \u2013 is currently 0.25% and a cut to 0.15% is widely predicted.</p> <p>Of greater interest will be what Draghi does to the deposit rate, or the interest banks get when they lodge money with the ECB. The strong speculation is that at this week's meeting it will become the first major central bank in the world to announce a negative rate, probably -0.1%. That means is that it will cost banks money to deposit money at the ECB. The hope is that they will lend the money out instead.</p> <h2>2 <strong>Support for more lending</strong></h2> <p>The ECB may announce more targeted steps to boost lending, especially in some of the weaker countries on the eurozone's periphery. Here, the ECB is likely to come up with its own version of the Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme, which gave banks access to cheaper credit but only on the condition that it was lent rather than hoarded. In the past, the ECB has used long-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to provide help to eurozone banks. A more targeted LTRO looks likely this week.</p> <h2>3 <strong>Stop sterilising</strong></h2> <p>Another way to get more money flowing around would be to stop \"sterilising\" bond purchases made during the height of the eurozone crisis under the ECB's now-terminated <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CEUQFjAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecb.europa.eu%2Fecb%2Feducational%2Ffacts%2Fmonpol%2Fhtml%2Fmp_011.en.html&amp;ei=xEaPU9_GKYvA7AbN0oGgDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNF4UiRDc8T8n6HnucIR8kI8x7OmZA&amp;sig2=-GH742Bvw0VIV9Zh3aRQ4Q&amp;bvm=bv.68235269,d.ZGU\" title=\"\">Securities Markets Program (SMP)</a>. Until now, sterilising has meant the central bank offsets the purchases it made of bonds of some troubled peripheral countries. This means it does not simply increase the money supply as a result of the bond purchases \u2013 which is known as quantitative easing. Instead the ECB has been taking the equivalent amount of money out from other parts of the system. It has been doing this by offering banks the chance to park money with it equal in value to the government bonds it still holds. Some economists propose to stop this weekly draining of money from the financial system.</p> <h2>4 <strong>Reviving the asset backed securities market</strong></h2> <p>The ECB and the BoE have been talking about getting more money flowing to businesses by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/02/asset-backed-securities-financial-crisis\" title=\"\">reviving the market for asset backed securities (ABS)</a>, where mortgages, loans or other debts are bundled up and sold on to other investors. The asset class was widely denounced as \"toxic sludge\" for their role in causing the global financial crisis but central bankers are keen to move to a new market with better vetting of the securities and Draghi could announce something in this area.</p> <h2>5 <strong>Printing money</strong></h2> <p>This is seen as unlikely for now, but some economists see full-blown quantitative easing somewhere along the road as the ECB fends of the threat of deflation. QE, whereby a central bank pumps electronic money into the financial system by buying up assets, has already been tried by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan.</p> <p>The latest eurozone data on Tuesday this week showed inflation was, at 0.5%, well below the ECB's target of just under 2%. But most economists say the picture would have to worsen considerably before QE becomes a likelihood.</p> <p>\"We remain doubtful that the ECB will undertake full blown quantitative easing. We suspect this will only happen if eurozone consumer price inflation heads falls to new lows below 0.5% over the coming months and eurozone growth falters further,\" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.</p> <h2>6 <strong>Do nothing</strong></h2> <p>While analysts and investors are convinced Draghi and his colleagues will act on Thursday the ECB has a final option: do nothing. Draghi has, after all, proved to be highly skilled at moving markets through words alone and without actually doing anything. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/26/euro-irreversible-mario-draghi-ecb\" title=\"\">His dramatic statement in July 2012 that the central bank would do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro </a>is widely credited as bringing to an end the worst phase of the region's crisis, amid elevated investor fears the currency bloc was on the verge of collapse.</p> <p>\"Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough,\" he famously declared at an investment conference in London. \"We think the euro is irreversible.\" Equity markets were immediately boosted, the euro strengthened, and sky high government borrowing costs in Spain and Italy came down, buying those under-pressure economies some much needed time. The statement marked the turning point in the eurozone crisis, and Draghi didn't have to cut rates or buy a single bond to achieve it.</p>",
