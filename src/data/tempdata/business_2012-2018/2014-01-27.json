    "webTitle": "Vince Cable undermines chancellor with 'wrong sort of recovery' message", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The business secretary, Vince Cable, on Monday evening infuriated his Conservative coalition colleagues when he chose the eve of the publication of the latest GDP figures to warn that Britain was experiencing the wrong sort of economic recovery and said his party was not wedded to the pace and scale of deficit cuts after 2015 set out by George Osborne. He said: \"There are different ways of finishing the job \u2026 not all require the pace and scale of cuts set out by the chancellor. And they could allow public spending to stabilise or grow in the next parliament, whilst still getting the debt burden down.\" His remarks can be interpreted as putting him closer to the position set out by the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, at the weekend. Cable warned that weak exports and a hoarding of cash by businesses meant \"the shape of the recovery has not been all that we might have hoped for\". The business secretary said the recovery was under way, but stressed that the UK should avoid another damaging boom-bust in the housing market by building more homes. In a significant political move, he signalled his clearest parting of the ways with the Conservatives over deficit reduction when he opposed the chancellor's plan to save an additional \u00a330bn in the next parliament. \"It is a case which he [Osborne] is perfectly entitled to make in a party capacity; but let us all be quite clear that this is a political and ideological commitment,\" Cable said in a lecture to the Royal Economic Society. \"The Liberal Democrats will reduce the debt burden but ensure this isn't done at the expense of public services and the most vulnerable in society.\" Cable argued that the additional \u00a330bn austerity proposed by the chancellor after 2015 went beyond the joint coalition commitment to eradicate the structural part of the UK's current budget deficit \u2013 the part of non-investment spending that will not disappear even when the economy has fully emerged from the recession of 2008-09. His remarks suggest the Liberal Democrats will not necessarily vote for the deficit reduction plan Osborne intends to put to MPs this autumn in an updated charter for fiscal responsibility. Osborne originally conceived the vote as a way of isolating Labour. But Cable stressed: \"The Liberal Democrats differ on ways of finishing the job \u2013 we want to ensure this isn't done at the expense of public services and the most vulnerable in society. It does not necessarily require the pace and scale of cuts set out by the chancellor. \"Undoubtedly some on the Conservative side of the coalition see fiscal consolidation as a cover for an ideologically driven 'small state' agenda. Indeed, it is one thing to respond to a record deficit after a long period of rising public spending, as we have since 2010. It is quite another to continue cutting hard from a position where the debt burden is falling and when spending has been under pressure for half a decade.\" Noting that there was a case for the state to exploit record low interest rates to boost public investment, Cable said: \"Some of the proposals to extend deep spending cuts on departments and welfare far into the next parliament have more than a whiff of ideology: slashing for its own sake.\" Cable said the immediate outlook for the economy was encouraging \u2013 a view likely to be underlined when the Office for National Statistics publishes its first estimate of growth for the fourth quarter of 2013. The City expects expansion of 0.8% in each of the second and third quarters to be followed by a 0.7% increase in activity in the three months to December. \"A real recovery is taking place,\" Cable said. \"The big question now is whether and how recent growth and optimism can be translated into long-term sustainable, balanced recovery without repeating the mistakes of the past. We cannot risk another property-linked boom-bust cycle which has done so much damage before, notably in the financial crash in 2008.\" Cable said it was \"disappointing\" that a 25% devaluation of sterling had done little to improve Britain's trade performance and said the political uncertainty caused by the Conservative pledge to hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU was \"deeply unsettling\" for firms operating in the single market. Cable said a third of mortgage debt was held by households who had borrowed more than our times their income. \"The US subprime mortgage crisis and its British equivalent were built on the shaky foundations of encouraging mass home purchase in inflating markets and we know where that led. It must not happen again.\" He warned: \"Unless our government put long term rebalancing at the heart of economic decision-making I believe the recovery could prove to be short-lived.\"",

      "bodyText": "And finally, French unemployment has jumped again to a fresh record high, meaning Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has failed to deliver his promise to get France's jobless rate falling by the end of 2013. The French labour ministry reported that French jobless claims rose a further 10,200 in December to hit a new record, with 3,303,200 people now out of work. That's the biggest figure on record, and means the jobless total has risen by 5.7% over the last 12 months. The only comfort for Hollande is that the rate of increase has slowed, with a 0.3% increase in December. But the failure to get unemployment adds to the pressure on Hollande, who pledged to cut public spending, and labour costs in a bid to revive the French economy and get firms hiring again. And that's all for tonight! See you tomorrow. Cheers, GW Jill Treanor has crunched the numbers, and concludes that RBS soon have posted losses totalling \u00a340bn since it was partially nationalised (assuming that it does make that \u00a38bn loss this year). That's not far shy of the \u00a345bn which taxpayers injected into the bank to stop it collapsing. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Committee, says that the latest trouble at RBS shows the importance of being able to claw back bonuses from errant bankers: \u201cRBS is still paying a heavy price for past misconduct. So too are its customers and taxpayers. It is crucial for the recovery that lending, particularly to SMEs, is not constrained as a result. \u201cThere is little prospect that the money needed to pay these fines can covered by claw-back, of either vested remuneration or deferred bonuses, from those responsible. There should be in future. The Banking Commission set out how to accomplish this.\" Last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said UK regulators are considering extending the period before bankers receive bonuses, to reinforce the need for long-term thinking. Critics of Europe's attempts to peg bonuses at 100% of salary (or 200% if shareholders agree) say this will undermine efforts to hold bankers to account, as it is harder to clawback or withhold basic pay. European stock markets have closed with losses across the board, led by another triple-digit fall on the FTSE 100, as fears of an emerging markets crisis continued to alarm investors. Shares were also hit by predictions that the US Federal Reserve would trim its bond-buying stimulus programme on Wednesday, despite recent market volatility, and concerns over the strength of China\u2019s economy. In London the FTSE 100 fell by 1.7%, shedding 113 points by the end of the day to 6550, as the sell-off that began last week continued. Other European indices fluctuated, but mainly finished in the red, with the FTSEurofirst index of major companies finishing down 0.9%. The FTSE\u2019s sharp decline was exacerbated by gas producer BG Group tumbling 13.7% after problems in Egypt and the US forced it to lower its forecasts, while Vodafone shed 3.8% after US rival AT&amp;T said it had no immediate plans to launch a takeover. Earlier, Asian markets had fallen heavily.The biggest losses were seen in Japan, where the Nikkei fell 2.5% as a bout of nervous selling gripped Asia. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Send index lost 2%. Emerging markets also suffered, with India\u2019s Sensex falling by 2%. Stephen Lewis, analyst at Monument Securities, warned that there is deep uncertainty over the outlook for 2014, despite top policymakers indicating they were guardedly optimistic for prospects over the next 12 months. Lewis said: \u201cEmerging economies could suffer a financial shock if advanced-country investors withdraw the capital they have invested, largely profitably, over recent years There is potential for a vicious circle in which foreign investors\u2019 taking profits undermines financial stability, damages economic prospects and prompts yet more investors to flee.\u201d Despite these latest provisions, RBS is still planning to ask shareholders for permission to pay bonuses of twice their basis salary: The biggest shareholder, of course, is the UK government -- who may come under renewed pressure not to allow large bonuses to be handed to staff at a bank which looks to be heading for another jawdropping loss this year.... Royal Bank of Scotland is holding a conference call with reporters now. Nathan Bostock, the bank's outgoing finance director, has confirmed that the various provisions announced today mean RBS will suffer a \"substantial loss\" for the current financial year. And CEO Ross McEwan has said the senior staff will not take bonuses as a matter of leadership. Interestingly, the news came today because RBS faced a filing deadline in America: And here's Jill's early take on the RBS story, and its impact on profitability ( is lossability a word?) for the current financial year: Royal Bank of Scotland set to report up to \u00a38bn losses for 2013 Curiously, RBS's share price wasn't badly hit by the news that almost \u00a33bn was being set aside to cover claims over mortgage-backed securities. Having already been down today, they briefly wobbled to a 3% loss, before finishing down 2.2% at 332p - close to their position before RBS's statement . It's more than six years since the financial crisis began, but RBS's CEO Ross McEwan says the bank is still chewing through the full damage - thus the extra \u00a32.9bn in new provisions for various issues: These latest unexpected losses mean Royal Bank of Scotland (still majority-owned by the taxpayer) could suffer a loss of up to \u00a38bn for this financial year, Jill Treanor adds. BIG NEWS in the City tonight: Royal Bank of Scotland just announced that it has set aside almost \u00a33bn to cover a fresh wave of litigation and matters related to the bank's conduct over a range of issues. In an unscheduled move, the Bank announced that it has set aside: \u2022 \u00a31.9bn to address \"various claims and conduct related matters affecting Group companies\" related to its involvement in mortgage-backed securities. \u2022 An extra \u00a3465m provision to compensate customers affected by the Payment Protection Insurance scancal \u2022 A further \u00a3500m provision for Interest Rate Hedging Products (controversial products sold to small firms which left many stuck with unfairly high borrowing costs). City Editor Jill Treanor flags up that the bank will not be paying bonuses to its top executives: More to follow.... Markets have now turned south, with the FTSE 100 now down 106 points, or 1.6%, in late trading. Other European shares are on the slide, wiping almost 1% off the STXE 600 index. With Wall Street handing back those earlier gains, it looks like a volatile session. As Mitul Kotecha, head of global markets research for Asia at Credit Agricole, put it earlier today: \"The growing turmoil in emerging markets is inflicting damage ... across the board and no letup is expected in the near term.\" Mike Ingram of BGC Partners reckons investors have finally woken up to the structural problems in emerging markets: Most stock markets are now in the red for the year, and still heading south. Indeed it\u2019s grimly impressive just how broad the market fallout has been. In addition to the collateral damage inflicted on equity markets, core bond markets have rallied convincingly; credit default swap spreads have risen across the board and even side-lined gold has managed a $20 pop. Volatility is up, as are traded volumes and overall this looks to be the first true \u2018risk off\u2019 episode markets have suffered since last summer\u2019s taper-inspired rout. And herein lays the tale; the market seems to have been truly taken by surprise, despite being given a rude reminder just eight months ago that all was not well with EMs. The problems there run the gamut from political instability (e.g. Egypt), corruption (e.g. Russia); current account vulnerability (e.g. India); commodity exposure (e.g. Brazil) and discredited central banks (Turkey). Wall Street has declined to join in today's selloff, with the Dow Jones index rising slightly this morning (up 37 points or 0.25% at 15918). Caterpillar's forecast-beating results (see here) are helping to reassure traders. There's little relief in London where the FTSE 100 is still down over 80 points, but the German, French and Italian markets have now clawed back their earlier losses. Here's two photos showing how emerging market currencies were being knocked back again this morning until Turkey's central bank announced an emergency meeting tomorrow morning, from World First's chief economist Jeremy Cook: Back in Brussels, Spain's finance minister Luis de Guindos is telling reporters that the eurozone won't be hit by recent events in the emerging markets (echoing eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem earlier today): Shares on Wall Street are expected to rise slightly when trading begins at 9.30am in New York, or 2.30pm London time, following the Dow's 2% tumble on Friday. Germany's Bundesbank has weighed in on the issue of a wealth tax, suggesting it could make sense for a country facing bankruptcy to tap its own citizens' assets before seeking help from abroad. In its latest monthly report (online here in German), Germany's central bank suggested that a country in financial trouble should impose a capital levy on its own citizens, alongside other fiscal measures. The Bundesbank said: The question arises whether in extraordinary national emergencies in addition to privatization and conventional consolidation efforts, private wealth can also contribute to avert a government insolvency It argued that such a wealth tax would be compatible with the principle of national responsibility (ie, a government's debts should fall on its taxpayers not someone else's), and could help resolve a debt crisis in an exceptional case. As the Wall Street Journal flags up, the Bundesbank acknowledges that such a wealth tax would be risky. Despite the merits of such an idea, a one-off levy is far from an easy solution and comes with \"substantial risks,\" the central bank said. To limit the negative impact on investment and potential capital flight, governments would have to credibly make the case that such a capital levy is indeed a one-time measure in a national crisis. That credibility would be best served if preceded by necessary structural reforms. Governments would also have to implement the one-time tax quickly, or risk boosting tax evasion, \"and increasing tax evasion would in turn decrease the acceptance of the levy,\" the Bundesbank said. And here's Reuters take: Germany's Bundesbank said on Monday that countries about to go bankrupt should draw on the private wealth of their citizens through a one-off capital levy before asking other states for help. The Bundesbank's tough stance comes after years of euro zone crisis that saw five government bailouts. There have also bond market interventions by the European Central Bank in, for example, Italy where households' average net wealth is higher than in Germany. \"(A capital levy) corresponds to the principle of national responsibility, according to which tax payers are responsible for their government's obligations before solidarity of other states is required,\" the Bundesbank said in its monthly report. It warned that such a levy carried significant risks and its implementation would not be easy, adding it should only be considered in absolute exceptional cases, for example to avert a looming sovereign insolvency. This might reassure the markets a little. Caterpillar, maker of mining and construction equipment, has beaten forecasts by reporting profits of $1.54 a share, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.28 per share in the last quarter. The company, seen as a decent barometer of the state of the global economy, also announced a $10bn share buyback. It said that economic indicators have improved in many countries, suggesting that the world economy is rebounding. It expects an increased in construction and power equipment sales this year, as growth in developing countries rises (from 4.5% to 5%) But it still expects companies to be cautious, with sales of large mining trucks probably just half the \"long-term replacement level\" in 2014. The slump in the mining sector in 2013 was also worse than it expected. Crisis watcher Yiannis Mouzakis reminds us that today was meant to be the day that eurozone finance ministers approved Greece's next loan payment. Eurogroup president (and Dutch finance minister) Jeroen Dijsselbloem has told reporters that he doesn't believe the problems in the emerging markets will spread to the eurozone. Speaking before today's Eurogroup meeting of finance ministers (online here), Dijsselbloem also said that talks between Greece and its lenders have dragged on too long. Worth noting that Greek bonds have weakened in value this morning, pushing up the yield (or interest rate) on its 10-year debt by 0.14 percentage points to 8.6%. This WSJ chart (more here) shows how the Turkish lira recovered a little after news of tomorrow's central bank meeting hit the wires: Turkey's central bank has been sparked into action by the slump in the value of the Turkish lira, by announcing it will hold an 'interim monetary policy meeting\" on Tuesday night. Last week the Bank left its main interest rates unchanged, even though a rate rise might have reassured investors and stemmed the slump in the lira. News of the meeting has helped the lira claw back most of this morning's early losses , on speculation that the Bank might take action and raise rates. But such a tightening of monetary policy could enrage Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is implacably opposed to raising interest rates. Erdogan believes that a rate rise would actually fuel Turkish inflation (contrary to conventional economic wisdom, and evidence). Reuters summed up Erdogan's logic recently. \u201cAs we lower the market rate, inflation will be lower,\" he said in January 2012. He said to the Tukson business that: \"In effect, we have to zero the real interest rate, this should be our goal, this is what we should achieve,\" so as not to \"make money from money.\" The FTSE 100 is now down 100 points, a drop of 1.5% -- putting it on track for its second triple-digit drop in a row. But Richard Dunbar of Scottish Widows flags up that most of the slide is due to Vodafone and BG. European stock markets are a rough sea of red this morning as traders drive shares down. In Europe, the FTSE 100 is the worst performer of the main indices, down almost 1.4% or 92 points at 6,571. Germany and France's markets are both down 0.4%. Among the emerging markets, India's Sensex has shed 2%, the Thai SET 50 is down 2.2% and South Africa's Top40 index has dropped almost 1%. And the Athens index (something of an emerging markets itself!) is down 1.4%. fastFT flags up that the FTSE Emerging Markets index has suffered its biggest fall in six-months today, down 1.7%. As mentioned already, the triple-whammy of China slowdown fears, the recent turmoil in emerging markets, and the prospect of the US Fed chopping another $10bn off its bond-buying programme (to $65bn/month) are all being blamed. It's not a full-blown crash, of course, but \"January may well end up being a month to forget for equities, just as many had feared,\" as Toby Morris of CMC put it. And Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities says: \"The coming week certainly has all the hallmarks for fostering a sharp sea change in market thinking and sentiment, though that is by no means assured.\" Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, say that City trading desks are reacting to Friday night's Wall Street tumble (when the Dow shed almost 2%), and are also surprised that AT&amp;T ruled out bidding for Vodafone in the near term. He explains why the FTSE 100 is down over 1%: \ufeffA combination of factors has caused markets to squirm, including the contraction in Chinese growth last week and the expectation of further cuts in the FOMC\u2019s debt-purchasing scheme later this week. Once again EU finance ministers are meeting in Brussels. However, the biggest issues worrying them in terms of the region's recovery will arguably be outside the EU borders. \ufeffBG Group and Vodafone have certainly contributed the lion\u2019s share to this morning\u2019s FTSE sell-off. After an hour of trading, BG Group shares are down 14% on the day following the company downgrading its guidance for both 2014 and 2015. This change in outlook has resulted from disappointing US figures and an Egyptian crisis that has left the company with no option but to declare a 'force majeure'. The news that AT&amp;T has ruled itself out of any possible bid for Vodafone has taken the market by surprise, especially as the CEO had made a number of comments relating to the potential of mobile broadband markets in Europe. Speculative investors had been positioning themselves for the prospect of a tie-up, and this morning\u2019s scramble to unwind positions has seen Vodafone shares shed almost 5%. A UK pawnbroker's efforts to find a buyer itself have floundered, after being crushed by the recent tumble in the gold price. Albemarle &amp; Bond, which had resorted to melting down its own gold reserves last month, has now given up on selling itself, and admitted its shares probably have little value. They promptly halved, to just 8p, valuing it at barely \u00a34m -- from over \u00a3220m in mid-2011. Pawnbroker Albemarle &amp; Bond abandons hunt for buyer This morning's selloff has dragged Britain's blue-chip index down to a five-week low. BG Group's production problems and AT&amp;T's announcement that it isn't planning a bid for Vodafone are partly to blame -- along with the wider nervousness in the markets about emerging economies, China and the prospect of the Federal Reserve trimming its stimulus package again this week. German business confidence has climbed again this month to the highest level in two and a half years. The monthly IFO survey of business confidence, just released, came in 110.6 in January, up from 109.5 in December, suggesting firms in Europe's largest economy began the year well. In the UK, prime minister David Cameron has admitted it will take time until a sustained economic recovery is established, but insisted Britain's on the right track. Speaking on the Today programme, he also denied that the recovery is unbalanced (saying manufacturing and services are both growing), but refused to deny that living standards in 2015 will be lower than they were in 2010. Our politics liveblogger Andy Sparrow has all the details. Shares in energy producer BG Group have tumbled 14% as investors digest downgraded forecasts issued this morning. Problems in Egypt and the US forced it to revise its outlook, something CEO Chris Finlayson admitted was \"very disappointing\". My colleague Sean Farrell flags up that it's \"effectively a production warning for 2014 and 2015: For 2014, the company said it now expected production volumes of the equivalent of 590,000-630,000 barrels of oil per day, compared with analysts' expectations of about 650k. For 2015, BG had previously said it expected to produce 775-825 kboed but today it has revised that down to 710-750. The problems are mainly in Egypt and in the US, where it has a low rig count. The company issued the statement because the market was out of line with its own expectations for 2014. It reports full year results on 4 February. In Egypt, it operates a LNG (liquid natural gas) plant, about 50% of whose production is contracted for use in the Egyptian domestic market. The new regime in Egypt has been diverting more than that into the domestic market meaning that BG cannot meet its obligations. Fresh turbulence in the currency markets this morning, with the Turkish lira being driven down to a fresh record low against the US dollar, of 2.35 lira to the greenback: Davos is known as a hotbed of deal-making, but a meeting in the ski resort during the World Economic Forum may have forced AT&amp;T to put its ambitions for Vodafone on ice, at least until the summer -- sending Vodafone's shares sliding 6% this morning. Sky News reported on Saturday that AT&amp;T's chairman and CEO, Randall Stephenson, had met EU commissioner Neelie Kroes to discuss his European ambitions. AT&amp;T has long been pondering a crack at Vodafone, which would be one of the biggest deals in the European markets in years. But, after being prompted by the UK Takeover Panel, AT&amp;T has now announced that\"it does not intend to make an offer for Vodafone\". It is now blocked from launching a bid for six months (unless there's a material change in circumstances, like a rival bidder). More here: AT&amp;T rules out imminent Vodafone bid The FTSE 100 has dropped 58 points -- being dragged down by two bigname players, Vodafone and BG Group. Vodafone shares are down 6% after US giant AT&amp;T declared that it has no plans to bid for the mobile communications rival, putting a stop to months of speculation (more shortly) And BG has shed 11% after cutting its production forecasts, partly due to problems in Egypt. Most other European markets are down, too, with the Italian FTSE MIB shedding 0.7%. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the global economy, the business world and the eurozone. Asian markets have taken a pummelling overnight as the share rout which began last week hit its largest stock exchanges. Fears over the emerging markets, the impact of the US Federal Reserve winding back its stimulus programme, and a possible slowdown in China all alarmed traders. Japan's Nikkei dived 2.5% to a two-month low, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 2% in a jittery day's trading. The main EU markets are likely to be under pressure this morning too, with the FTSE 100 likely to lose another 30 points when trading begins (it was being called down 70 points earlier this morning...) Michael Hewson of CMC Markets blamed: a trifecta of concerns about weak US earnings, Chinese growth, and financial market instability in countries like Argentina, Ukraine and Turkey rippled out into other emerging markets. Investors are bracing for the Fed to possibly cut another $10bn off its bond-buying stimulus programme when policymakers meet this week. As Ian Williams of Peel Hunt put it: The trouble may have started in the emerging market currencies, but this morning the likely continuation of Fed tapering this week, and renewed fears of a more severe Chinese slowdown seem to be taking the blame. But that emerging market currency crisis hasn't gone away, after last week's tumble in the Argentinian peso forced its government to relax currency controls. Reuters reports that shopkeepers spent the weekend slapping new price tags on imported goods, to reflect the 20% slump in the peso's value this last week. And if that wasn't enough to worry the markets, there's a meeting of Eurogroup finance ministers later today, where Greece is likely to be ticked off for not making more progress implementing its austerity programme. I'll be tracking all the main action through the day",

Volatility is up, as are traded volumes and overall this looks to be the first true 'risk off' episode markets have suffered since last summer's taper-inspired rout. \"The market seems to have been truly taken by surprise, despite being given a rude reminder just eight months ago that all was not well with emerging markets.\" Ingram said the problems included political instability in Egypt, corruption in Russia); current account vulnerability in India; commodity exposure in Brazil; and the discredited central bank in Turkey.",

      "bodyText": "Governments need to deter oil speculators, set aside reserves of crude oil and take steps urgently to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels in order to escape price volatility that undermines stable economic growth, according to a report co-authored by one of Britain's top scientists. The exploitation of shale oil and gas may mitigate damaging price fluctuations in future but it will be terrible news for the environment and is not a longer term solution to the world's energy needs, said the report co-written by Sir David King, published on Tuesday. The study for Oxford University by King, Oliver Inderwildi and Zoheir Ebrahim, describes the volatility of crude oil prices, which has characterised this commodity market over the last four decades, as \"a fundamental barrier to stability and economic growth\" around the world. King is a former Oxford professor and government chief scientific adviser who, these days, is special climate change representative for the foreign secretary, William Hague. The paper recommends policies to tackle supply and demand in the oil industry, including further action to clamp down on high frequency trading. \"Policy must focus on re-aligning the use of the oil derivative market away from speculation and towards its initial purpose: hedging. Improving derivatives market regulatory systems and working towards international derivatives regulatory standards will be vital in achieving this goal but efforts to curb speculation so far have been lacklustre,\" says the report, which is called Macroeconomic impacts of oil price volatility: mitigation and resilience, and is published in Frontiers of Energy. It predicts that the European Commission's proposed Financial Transactions Tax will fail because it will not be high enough \u2013 at 0.1% on share trading and 0.01% on derivatives deals \u2013 and does not differentiate between speculators and genuine hedgers. Britain's use of fossil fuels will come under further scrutiny this week when a government-commissioned study will urge ministers to boost North Sea oil and gas production by forcing companies to share infrastructure. Meanwhile the Oxford study calls for more far-reaching policies to manage demand in a bid to reduce the world's dependence on oil. \"Part of this role will require the politically challenging task of energy subsidy and tax reform to incentivise the consumption of alternative fuels and disincentivise oil consumption, particularly in non-OECD countries where oil price subsidies have been institutionalised,\" it said. \"But a significant opportunity in reducing the demand for oil is also to be found in policies that are aimed at improving energy efficiency such as the adoption of fuel-economy standards and the construction of codes and requirements for greater energy efficiency in various sectors of the economy.\" The report's authors highlight the importance of collective responsibility, discussing the strategic oil reserve administered by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which can be used to reduce price volatility in times of crisis. Given the IEA's projection that oil prices will reach at least $215 a barrel by 2035, the study says global co-operation will be fundamental to the management and reduction of price volatility. The study also suggests regulating to force large oil-reliant industries to maintain their own oil stocks, which would insulate them from sudden spikes in prices. Governments should also incentivise business to invest in infrastructure promoting alternative fuel and energy sources or that promotes greener energy provision, says the study. The authors note that additional unconventional fossil fuel obtained through processes including fracking will come online over the next decade, suggesting that they are highly likely to keep oil prices relatively low. It describes this development as \"terrible news for the environment\" but \"excellent news for the economy\" which will \"buy us time for decarbonisation endeavours\".

      "bodyText": "European stock markets posted fresh losses on Monday, with London leading the way, as fears of an emerging markets crisis continued to alarm investors and sent shares sliding in Asia overnight. Shares were also hit by predictions that the US Federal Reserve would trim its bond-buying stimulus programme on Wednesday, despite recent market volatility, and concerns over the strength of China's economy. In London, the FTSE 100 fell by 1.7%, shedding 113 points by the end of the day to 6550, as the sell-off that began last week continued. Other European indices fluctuated, but mainly finished in the red, with the FTSEurofirst index of major companies finishing down 0.9%. The FTSE's sharp decline was exacerbated by gas producer BG Group tumbling 13.7% after problems in Egypt and the US forced it to lower its forecasts, while Vodafone shed 3.8% after US rival AT&amp;T said it had no immediate plans to launch a takeover. The biggest losses were seen in Japan, where the Nikkei fell 2.5% as a bout of nervous selling gripped Asia. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2%. Emerging markets also suffered, with India's Sensex falling by 2%. Wall Street opened slightly higher, after a heavy sell-off on Friday night. \"A combination of factors has caused markets to squirm, including the contraction in Chinese growth last week and the expectation of further cuts in the FOMC's [Federal Reserve's] debt-purchasing scheme later this week,\" said Toby Morris of CMC Markets. The Fed will decide on Wednesday whether to \"taper\" its stimulus programme, and could reduce it by $10bn (\u00a36bn) to $65bn (\u00a339bn) per month.

Traders believe it could raise borrowing costs in an attempt to stem the lira's steady decline, despite prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan opposing any interest rate rises. Emerging markets have been under pressure since Argentina's peso suffered its biggest fall since 2002 after as its government gave up its attempts to support the currency. Mike Ingram, market strategist at BGC Partners, said markets appeared to have been \"truly taken by surprise\" by the fears over emerging markets, despite a previous market wobble last summer when the Fed came close to slowing its stimulus package. \"The problems in emerging markets run the gamut from political instability (eg Egypt), corruption (eg Russia); current account vulnerability (eg India); commodity exposure (eg Brazil) and discredited central banks (eg Turkey),\" Ingram wrote to clients.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's recovery is expected to have held up over the final months of 2013, helping the economy to clock up its strongest annual growth for six years. While there is still much ground to cover to get back to pre-crisis levels of output, most economists expect official data on Tuesday to confirm that last year ended on a relatively strong note. Many see growth for 2013 being just shy of 2%, marking the strongest performance since 2007. On average, City analysts forecast the economy grew 0.7% in the fourth quarter, down slightly from 0.8% in the previous two quarters. But that consensus, in a Reuters poll of 50 economists, masks a wide spectrum of forecasts that go as low as 0.3% growth and as high as 0.9%. Official data has been mixed in recent weeks, with construction and manufacturing appearing to stall while retail sales shot up at Christmas \u2013 a mix that runs counter to the government's attempts to rebalance the economy away from reliance on domestic demand. Last week's drop in unemployment was good news for ministers but far greater than the Bank of England had been forecasting and may well force it to abandon its forward guidance policy. While employment has risen, pay has on average failed to keep up with inflation, squeezing living standards for several years. Income from employment increased only marginally in January, according to the latest monthly survey of households' financial wellbeing on Monday from the data company Markit. But households were generally less gloomy about their finances, Markit said, with the main measure of wellbeing at its joint highest level since the survey began five years ago. \"January's survey highlights some light at the end of the tunnel for UK households, with falling consumer price inflation and better labour market conditions helping to bring down the squeeze on finances after five years of gloom,\" said Tim Moore, a senior economist at Markit. Unlike the uneven official data, business surveys have painted a generally positive picture in recent months, leaving economists to weigh up mixed evidence as they try to predict this week's growth figures from the Office for National Statistics \u2013 the first of three takes it will publish on fourth-quarter GDP. Philip Shaw, economist at Investec, is forecasting 0.7% growth. \"Although the economic outlook remains upbeat, specific factors suggest that growth during the fourth quarter did not quite keep pace with the two previous quarters,\" he said, citing a drop in construction output and flatlining industrial production. \"Fundamentally we would argue that an out-turn of 0.7% should not be a disappointment. The indicators are volatile and subject to revision while in any case there is no evidence whatsoever that the recovery is petering out.\" Jonathan Loynes at the thinktank Capital Economics goes for 0.8% growth. \"While slightly less than the [Bank of England's] monetary policy committee, for example, is expecting, this would still take annual growth in 2013 as a whole to 1.9%, the best performance since 2007,\" he said. Although the construction sector, which accounts for just over 6% of the economy, has been seen as dragging on growth in the fourth quarter, there are signs in a report on Monday that it is picking up. Makers of bricks, steel, plumbing and other building materials have enjoyed a rise in demand and expect sales to continue climbing, according to a survey by the Construction Products Association (CPA). Overall, two-thirds of construction product manufacturing firms reported a rise in sales in the fourth quarter compared with the previous quarter and with the previous year. There have been concerns that manufacturers which mothballed plants and laid off workers in the downturn are now struggling to keep up with the resurgence in demand for building materials. Builders and estate agents have highlighted a brick shortage in particular as the government's Help to Buy scheme boosts the housing market. But the CPA seeks to allay those fears in its report, stating that most of the companies it surveyed do not foresee capacity problems this year. Three-quarters of all product manufacturers will be operating at less than 90% capacity at the end of this year, it said. Noble Francis, the group's economics director, said construction growth had spread beyond the private housing sector to commercial and infrastructure projects. \"Of concern, however, manufacturers reported margins continue to be severely hindered by cost rises, especially in energy and transport fuel. In addition, manufacturers also reported that labour costs and materials costs rose in the fourth quarter,\" he said. Separate figures released on Monday by the trade association, UK Steel, found that demand for steel rose in 2013. Production remained well below the levels seen before the financial crisis, however, and the recovery was \"weak and patchy\". British crude steel production in 2013 averaged 228,000 tonnes a week, 24% higher than in 2012. That was largely due to rising output from the Teesside steelworks, now owned by the Thai company SSI, and from Tata Steel's Port Talbot plant. Ian Rodgers, director of UK Steel, said the fourth quarter output was the highest quarterly level since the start of the recession. \"This suggests that UK demand for steel has now turned the corner.\"",

The indicators are volatile and subject to revision while in any case there is no evidence whatsoever that the recovery is petering out.\"</p> <p>Jonathan Loynes at the thinktank Capital Economics goes for 0.8% growth.</p> <p>\"While slightly less than the [Bank of England's] monetary policy committee, for example, is expecting, this would still take annual growth in 2013 as a whole to 1.9%, the best performance since 2007,\" he said.</p> <p>Although the construction sector, which accounts for just over 6% of the economy, has been seen as dragging on growth in the fourth quarter, there are signs in a report on Monday that it is picking up.</p> <p>Makers of bricks, steel, plumbing and other building materials have enjoyed a rise in demand and expect sales to continue climbing, according to a survey by the Construction Products Association (CPA).</p> <p>Overall, two-thirds of construction product manufacturing firms reported a rise in sales in the fourth quarter compared with the previous quarter and with the previous year.</p> <p>There have been concerns that manufacturers which mothballed plants and laid off workers in the downturn are now struggling to keep up with the resurgence in demand for building materials.</p> <p>Builders and estate agents have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/14/brickmakers-straining-to-meet-demand\" title=\"\">highlighted a brick shortage</a> in particular as the government's Help to Buy scheme boosts the housing market.</p> <p>But the CPA seeks to allay those fears in its report, stating that most of the companies it surveyed do not foresee capacity problems this year. Three-quarters of all product manufacturers will be operating at less than 90% capacity at the end of this year, it said.</p> <p>Noble Francis, the group's economics director, said construction growth had spread beyond the private housing sector to commercial and infrastructure projects.</p> <p>\"Of concern, however, manufacturers reported margins continue to be severely hindered by cost rises, especially in energy and transport fuel. In addition, manufacturers also reported that labour costs and materials costs rose in the fourth quarter,\" he said.</p> <p>Separate figures released on Monday by the trade association, UK Steel, found that demand for steel rose in 2013. Production remained well below the levels seen before the financial crisis, however, and the recovery was \"weak and patchy\".</p> <p>British crude steel production in 2013 averaged 228,000 tonnes a week, 24% higher than in 2012. That was largely due to rising output from the Teesside steelworks, now owned by the Thai company SSI, and from Tata Steel's Port Talbot plant.</p> <p>Ian Rodgers, director of UK Steel, said the fourth quarter output was the highest quarterly level since the start of the recession. \"This suggests that UK demand for steel has now turned the corner.\"</p>",
