The City only really has one question \u2013 though this is not necessarily a criticism when you study its record for dealing with two issues in tandem. Anyway, the poser is: how will the Russia crisis affect them? If the query looks simple, the answers may not be. Along with trouble in the Middle East, tensions with Russia have pushed oil prices higher, which investors tend to like. But then we have the creeping sanctions on Russia from the west to set alongside BP's 19.75% stake in the Russian oil giant Rosneft \u2013 which accounts for about 9% of BP's value and dividends of about \u00a3450m. Meanwhile, Shell has huge Russian investments and is the largest firm based in the Netherlands, the home of many victims of flight MH17. But does that all spell trouble? It's difficult to believe anybody is really sure. It's not clear if the furious rhetoric from some politicians will conclude with more moves against Russia \u2013 where allegiances can prove fluid, as oil investors know. WikiLeaks cables suggest that BP boss Bob Dudley blamed Russia's then deputy PM Igor Sechin for having to flee the country for his own protection in 2008. Sechin is now boss of Dudley's ally, Rosneft. BAE poised to benefit from the new cold war The infuriatingly talented Hugh Laurie once wrote a novel called The Gun Seller, a hilarious tale about a former Scots Guard, Thomas Lang. Lang gets himself caught up in one of those sagas that could befall us all \u2013 you know, a conspiracy involving arms dealers and terrorists \u2013 but one of the underlying themes is how international incidents are great opportunities to sell weapons. Which, in a tortuous way, brings us to the UK's largest defence contractor, BAE Systems, and its results announcement this week, which comes against the backdrop of a new cold war. There's no likely sanctions hit on the firm's sales (Mr Putin does not have an account) but the potential effect of the crisis on future profits is being hyped. As one analyst puts it: \"Defence budgets have been perceived as a luxury \u2013 something you could raid to fund other spending. Now it feels like Europe needs a stronger military force\". Well, maybe, and that idea does tie in neatly with Laurie's yarn, which highlights unforeseen profits. The evil helicopter being marketed by his story's baddies is defeated by Lang with another weapon. The makers of the second bit of kit enjoy a sales hike. With Libor, it's not the fine: it's the fine words Roll up, roll up. Any day now another fine for rigging Libor should drop from the Financial Conduct Authority (plus the usual queue of US regulators who like to receive their tribute). Bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group is the latest target and is thought to be drafting a cheque for \u00a3200m-\u00a3300m, but \u2013 as with all of the Libor fines so far \u2013 the number is the least entertaining bit, as the fines are always accompanied by the pages of emails and electronic chats used as evidence. When Barclays got done, we saw one from a trader lauding a pal for fixing the rate with the line: \"When I retire and write a book about this business, your name will be written in golden letters.\" The reply: \"I would prefer this not be in any book!\" Then Royal Bank of Scotland got clobbered, and we learned of a broker telling one of the bank's Libor submitters: \"I'll send lunch around for everybody.\" And as Swiss bank UBS was whacked, we were treated to a trader's promise that \"I will fucking do one humongous deal with you\". The intriguing thing about these messages is that the senders never tried to conceal them, suggesting nobody at these varied institutions thought they were doing anything wrong. Still, blame rogue individuals please \u2013 not the City's culture.",

      "bodyText": "It's the start of the great summer getaway and the traffic is heavy as families pile into their cars and head for British beaches that for once are as hot as their Mediterranean rivals. There's a lot to organise, but for families zooming along the A64 for Scarborough's sun-kissed sands, stocking up on holiday groceries has never been easier. A quick pitstop at Asda's drive-thru on the outskirts of York and you can have the shopping in the boot and be back on the road within five minutes. \"You can order from your caravan or on the journey,\" says Mark Ibbotson, Asda's chief operations officer. The service will reach 200 stores by the end of this year. Heatwave or no heatwave, it has never been so easy to avoid setting foot in a supermarket, either by shopping online or making more frequent trips to local convenience stores. This is causing a major headache for grocery giants, who have spent the last 20 years engaged in a \"space race\" to open the most supermarkets. Tesco won that battle and is almost twice as big as market number two Asda. But changing shopping patterns mean that those miles of shopping aisles are now weighing on profitability. Big-box out-of-town stores face a very uncertain future. The Institute of Grocery Distribution, the industry thinktank, predicts that \u00a33bn less will be rung up in big stores (over 25,000 sq ft) in five years' time. Meanwhile, the market share commanded by the high street discounters \u2013 Aldi, Lidl and Poundland \u2013 will almost double in size to account for \u00a31 out of every \u00a39 spent on British groceries. \"The reality is that the model of retailing for the last 60 years is no longer fit for the changing needs of consumers,\" says one senior industry source. \"The question is: what are you doing to adapt your space to the new economics?\" There is a lot of experimentation going on, much of it led by Tesco. Philip Clarke, who was ousted as chief executive last week, was trying to reinvent its nearly 250 Extra shops, which can be as big as 120,000 sq ft, as shopping destinations. Tesco has been turning over space to food outlets such as Harris + Hoole, which it half owns, and Euphorium Bakeries, as well as to gyms and soft play centres. It has even let surplus car park space to vehicle hire firm Avis. Asda, part of US giant Walmart, has also been unpicking its business model. Its 355 supermarkets range in size from 15,000 sq ft to in excess of 100,000 sq ft. Earlier this month, Asda announced 1,360 job losses as part of a five-year programme to cut costs by \u00a31bn. Ibbotson said changing shopping habits meant it had to \"reassess\" its strategy. \"I have been in the industry for 30 years and in the past three years it has changed more [than the previous 27 years] and we expect for it to change more quickly over the next three years than the last [three],\" said Ibbotson. In the York store, which is a testbed for a lot of Asda's new ideas, checkout staff are disappearing, replaced by self service tills. It is also testing a \"rapid scan\" till that can scan groceries three times as fast as any human. Drive-thrus are not stealing sales from the adjoining stores, Asda insists, but at York only a third of drive-thru shoppers park and pop into the store. \"We're not seeing any cannibalisation,\" Ibbotson says. \"It's complementary because of the growth of the grocery home shopping business.\" Asda is cashing in on Britain's growing love affair with click-and-collect shopping by putting collection points in its stores as well as in petrol stations and installing unmanned secure lockers near office blocks where commuters can collect their groceries on the way home. Kantar Retail analyst Bryan Roberts says Tesco and Asda are battling \"non-food hangovers\" in their big stores as former money-spinners \u2013 such as electricals, toys, books, DVDs and CDs \u2013 have been hit hard by the internet. \"Asda is more exposed than most to this trend because the vast majority of its sales come through superstores, but what has insulated it is [fashion label] George, which is a destination brand,\" he says. \"Tesco has got a problem with its big box stores because it doesn't have a George.\" Roberts reckons many of Tesco's problems are of its own making, because it falls short on retail basics. \"All the coffee shops in the world aren't going to fix a lack of manpower and getting the basics right,\" he adds. But one supermarket chief reckons that big-box grocery could yet return to vogue once Britons' spending power recovers: \"As the economy swings back there could be a shift back in favour of them, because the economic model is best served by them. In big stores, prices are lower and choice is better. This is something the industry has to figure out, but it can't carry on subsidising unprofitable channels [like online] forever. In that sense what Philip Clarke was doing was not a stupid strategy by any means.\"",

    "webTitle": "We know Dave Lewis can sell soap. Can he really run Tesco?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dave Lewis has sold a lot of soap. He's done it by convincing women that they're better looking than they think they are, with Dove's \"love your body\" campaign. Now the 49-year-old Yorkshireman, who joined Dove-owner Unilever as a trainee in 1987, has got to work his magic again at Tesco. The sudden axing of Philip Clarke as Tesco chief executive last week \u2013 on the day before a glittering party planned at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum to celebrate his 40 years at the supermarket \u2013 was not entirely unexpected, following increasingly poor performance from Britain's biggest retailer. But the appointment of Lewis, president of Unilever's \"personal care\" business \u2013 soaps and deodorants including Dove, Lynx and Sure \u2013 stunned many experienced retail experts, who view it as a big risk to appoint someone with zero retail experience to the most powerful retailing job in the county. \"I don't know anyone who knows him,\" says veteran retail consultant Richard Hyman. \"It's come completely from left field. It's a real surprise that they have gone for a non-retailer, especially because all previous Tesco bosses have been born and bred Tesco.\" A senior retail executive who knows Lewis well says: \"He's a marketeer, so clearly that's where [the Tesco board] think their problems are. He's measured, balanced, thoughtful \u2013 not exactly charismatic\". Clarke was a Tesco lifer, having risen through the ranks from stacking Tesco's shelves in Liverpool to the boardroom and chief executive's office in Tesco House in Cheshunt, on the outskirts of London. Lewis, until now, has been a Unilever lifer: he joined Lever Brothers (a forerunner of Unilever) as a graduate trainee straight out of Nottingham Polytechnic (now Nottingham Trent) where he read business studies. Now he will be the first outsider to head the supermarket since Jack Cohen founded Tesco 96 years ago. Tesco will want to avoid the fate of French supermarket giant Carrefour, which also looked to a consumer goods man to lead its turnaround. Carrefour's 2009 poaching of Nestl\u00e9's Lars Olofsson as chief executive was quickly followed by five profits warnings and Olofsson was shown the door. \"I think he will struggle,\" the retailer said of Lewis. \"A Unilever lifer thrown into the blood and guts of UK grocery retail. Never been a CEO, never been a grocer \u2013 hmm.\" But drastic times \u2013 Tesco last month reported its biggest drop in sales in 40 years despite Clarke injecting \u00a31bn to revitalise stores \u2013 call for drastic measures. In this case that means \"drastic Dave\", as Lewis was known after cutting more than 300 jobs when he restructured Unilever UK in 2007. Sir Richard Broadbent, Tesco's chairman, said Clarke had been \"hugely successful\", but that the supermarket, which is losing customers to Aldi and Lidl at the lower end of the market and Waitrose at the upper end, needed \"somebody with a fresh eye and the perspective to think more laterally and take a more decisive view of the business\". Clarke was given his marching orders last Friday night, before the supermarket's board met for an emergency meeting on Sunday night, and announced his departure at 7am on Monday morning, together with another profits warning. Not only was his V&amp;A party cancelled, he also had to pull out of the annual Tesco charity golf day at the Royal Automobile Club's Woodcote Park course near Epson Downs Racecourse. Tesco royalty past and present, including former chairmen Lord MacLaurin and Sir David Reid, played on without him. While the timing wasn't of his choosing, Clarke told the BBC he was \"resigned\" to his fate. He said that even his own father, a former store manager, regularly complained about the state of his local Tesco store in Liverpool. Broadbent had been plotting to find a replacement for Clarke since Tesco's latest dismal trading update on 4 June. At the time, Clarke told reporters: \"I'm not going anywhere\" but conceded that the sales figures were the worst he had seen in his four-decade career. Broadbent and Patrick Cescau, a senior independent director at Tesco and former Unilever chief executive, called in retail headhunter Patricia Tehan, of boutique firm Lygon Group. Lewis was top of her list. Broadbent approached Lewis directly a couple of weeks ago, and Lewis said he wanted to take the job straightaway. He told Broadbent he knew there were would be difficult challenges ahead but he couldn't imagine anyone who wouldn't be interested in running such a historic business. In early July, Broadbent told incoming finance director Alan Stewart of Marks &amp; Spencer, who was appointed on 10 July, that he would be reporting to Lewis, not Clarke. Clarke, who will leave in October with a near-\u00a34m payoff, was kept in the dark. Broadbent dismisses suggestions that Lewis doesn't understand retail, pointing out that Lewis is well-known to many senior Tesco executives \"over many years in his roles at Unilever\", one of Tesco's biggest suppliers. Lewis also rejects the criticism as unfounded and points out that he's worked closely with Unilever's retail customers around the world, and understands grocers intimately. According to Lewis's camp, Tesco is full to bursting with retail talent. What it needs is a turnaround man with a strategic mind and branding experience. Lewis is currently working from his home in Weybridge, Surrey. The speed of his appointment means he has had little time to get acquainted with the business, its staff and portfolio of 6,784 stores worldwide. He has privately admitted that he has little idea what he's going to find when he gets behind his new desk in Cheshunt, but he has spoken to Clarke and other Tesco executives. Lewis, whose career has taken him to South America, Indonesia, the US and central Europe, was widely seen as a potential successor to Unilever chief executive Paul Polman. He turned around Unilever UK and oversaw 27 consecutive quarters of growth in Britain, but admits he never expected to serve quite such a long term at Unilever. \"I came to Unilever to do two years and then go back to my own business,\" he said recently. \"It's 27 years later, and I've shown a startling lack of ambition to do it.\" Polman doesn't doubt Lewis's ambition and didn't try and talk him out of taking on the Tesco role. \"It is very hard to say don't take this wonderful opportunity,\" Polman said. \"It's never easy if you become chief executive, and he has a big challenge. He is out there alone and it's a very high amount of responsibility given to him.\" Lewis is well liked among FTSE 100 bosses, retail and otherwise, and has become firm friends with Jeremy Darroch, the boss of BSkyB and fellow Weybridge resident. He is a non-executive director of BSkyB. Andrew Higginson, a former Tesco director who is also on the BSkyB board, said: \"Dave Lewis is a great hire for Tesco. He's a very seasoned and successful manager. He's got great values and will be very strong on sorting the strategy out.\" The most common adjectives used by Lewis's friends to describe him are \"dynamic\", \"serious\" and \"ambitious\". He also has a social conscience. Friends point out that the Dove \"real beauty\" campaign he deployed was as much about \"strong feelings about [women's] self-esteem\" as it was about money.

      "body": "<p>Dave Lewis has sold a lot of soap. He's done it by convincing women that they're better looking than they think they are, with Dove's \"love your body\" campaign.</p> <p>Now the 49-year-old Yorkshireman, who joined Dove-owner Unilever as a trainee in 1987, has got to work his magic again at Tesco.</p> <p>The sudden axing of Philip Clarke as Tesco chief executive last week \u2013 on the day before a glittering party planned at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum to celebrate his 40 years at the supermarket \u2013 was not entirely unexpected, following increasingly poor performance from Britain's biggest retailer.</p> <p>But the appointment of Lewis, president of Unilever's \"personal care\" business \u2013 soaps and deodorants including Dove, Lynx and Sure \u2013 stunned many experienced retail experts, who view it as a big risk to appoint someone with zero retail experience to the most powerful retailing job in the county. \"I don't know anyone who knows him,\" says veteran retail consultant Richard Hyman. \"It's come completely from left field. It's a real surprise that they have gone for a non-retailer, especially because all previous Tesco bosses have been born and bred Tesco.\"</p> <p>A senior retail executive who knows Lewis well says: \"He's a marketeer, so clearly that's where [the Tesco board] think their problems are. He's measured, balanced, thoughtful \u2013 not exactly charismatic\".</p> <p>Clarke was a Tesco lifer, having risen through the ranks from stacking Tesco's shelves in Liverpool to the boardroom and chief executive's office in Tesco House in Cheshunt, on the outskirts of London. Lewis, until now, has been a Unilever lifer: he joined Lever Brothers (a forerunner of Unilever) as a graduate trainee straight out of Nottingham Polytechnic (now Nottingham Trent) where he read business studies. Now he will be the first outsider to head the supermarket since Jack Cohen founded Tesco 96 years ago.</p> <p>Tesco will want to avoid the fate of French supermarket giant Carrefour, which also looked to a consumer goods man to lead its turnaround. Carrefour's 2009 poaching of Nestl\u00e9's Lars Olofsson as chief executive was quickly followed by five profits warnings and Olofsson was shown the door. \"I think he will struggle,\" the retailer said of Lewis. \"A Unilever lifer thrown into the blood and guts of UK grocery retail. Never been a CEO, never been a grocer \u2013 hmm.\"</p> <p>But drastic times \u2013 Tesco last month reported its biggest drop in sales in 40 years despite Clarke injecting \u00a31bn to revitalise stores \u2013 call for drastic measures. In this case that means \"drastic Dave\", as Lewis was known after cutting more than 300 jobs when he restructured Unilever UK in 2007.</p> <p>Sir Richard Broadbent, Tesco's chairman, said Clarke had been \"hugely successful\", but that the supermarket, which is losing customers to Aldi and Lidl at the lower end of the market and Waitrose at the upper end, needed \"somebody with a fresh eye and the perspective to think more laterally and take a more decisive view of the business\".</p> <p>Clarke was given his marching orders last Friday night, before the supermarket's board met for an emergency meeting on Sunday night, and announced his departure at 7am on Monday morning, together with another profits warning. Not only was his V&amp;A party cancelled, he also had to pull out of the annual Tesco charity golf day at the Royal Automobile Club's Woodcote Park course near Epson Downs Racecourse. Tesco royalty past and present, including former chairmen Lord MacLaurin and Sir David Reid, played on without him.</p> <p>While the timing wasn't of his choosing, Clarke told the BBC he was \"resigned\" to his fate. He said that even his own father, a former store manager, regularly complained about the state of his local Tesco store in Liverpool.</p> <p>Broadbent had been plotting to find a replacement for Clarke since Tesco's latest dismal trading update on 4 June. At the time, Clarke told reporters: \"I'm not going anywhere\" but conceded that the sales figures were the worst he had seen in his four-decade career.</p> <p>Broadbent and Patrick Cescau, a senior independent director at Tesco and former Unilever chief executive, called in retail headhunter Patricia Tehan, of boutique firm Lygon Group. Lewis was top of her list.</p> <p>Broadbent approached Lewis directly a couple of weeks ago, and Lewis said he wanted to take the job straightaway. He told Broadbent he knew there were would be difficult challenges ahead but he couldn't imagine anyone who wouldn't be interested in running such a historic business.</p> <p>In early July, Broadbent told incoming finance director Alan Stewart of Marks &amp; Spencer, who was appointed on 10&#xa0;July, that he would be reporting to Lewis, not Clarke. Clarke, who will leave in October with a near-\u00a34m payoff, was kept in the dark.</p> <p>Broadbent dismisses suggestions that Lewis doesn't understand retail, pointing out that Lewis is well-known to many senior Tesco executives \"over many years in his roles at Unilever\", one of Tesco's biggest suppliers.</p> <p>Lewis also rejects the criticism as unfounded and points out that he's worked closely with Unilever's retail customers around the world, and understands grocers intimately. According to Lewis's camp, Tesco is full to bursting with retail talent. What it needs is a turnaround man with a strategic mind and branding experience.</p> <p>Lewis is currently working from his home in Weybridge, Surrey. The speed of his appointment means he has had little time to get acquainted with the business, its staff and portfolio of 6,784 stores worldwide. He has privately admitted that he has little idea what he's going to find when he gets behind his new desk in Cheshunt, but he has spoken to Clarke and other Tesco executives.</p> <p>Lewis, whose career has taken him to South America, Indonesia, the US and central Europe, was widely seen as a potential successor to Unilever chief executive Paul Polman. He turned around Unilever UK and oversaw 27 consecutive quarters of growth in Britain, but admits he never expected to serve quite such a long term at Unilever.</p> <p>\"I came to Unilever to do two years and then go back to my own business,\" he said recently. \"It's 27 years later, and I've shown a startling lack of ambition to do it.\"</p> <p>Polman doesn't doubt Lewis's ambition and didn't try and talk him out of taking on the Tesco role.</p> <p>\"It is very hard to say don't take this wonderful opportunity,\" Polman said. \"It's never easy if you become chief executive, and he has a big challenge. He is out there alone and it's a very high amount of responsibility given to him.\"</p> <p>Lewis is well liked among FTSE 100 bosses, retail and otherwise, and has become firm friends with Jeremy Darroch, the boss of BSkyB and fellow Weybridge resident. He is a non-executive director of BSkyB. Andrew Higginson, a former Tesco director who is also on the BSkyB board, said: \"Dave Lewis is a great hire for Tesco. He's a very seasoned and successful manager. He's got great values and will be very strong on sorting the strategy out.\"</p> <p>The most common adjectives used by Lewis's friends to describe him are \"dynamic\", \"serious\" and \"ambitious\". He also has a social conscience. Friends point out that the Dove \"real beauty\" campaign he deployed was as much about \"strong feelings about [women's] self-esteem\" as it was about money. A friend says: \"It is really important to him that his brands can have a social impact. It might sound hifalutin, but it's true.\" Advertising campaigns under his watch have won 50 Cannes Lions awards, the ad industry's top gongs.</p> <p>Lewis also has a playful and athletic side: he ran the London Marathon in four hours 18 minutes, despite having not run further than three miles before deciding to take up the challenge. \"With the race sponsor being Flora \u2013 a Unilever brand \u2013 I felt I had to give it a go,\" he said.</p> <p>A close friend and retail boss says his new found athleticism (he also competes in the Unilever triathlon) doesn't cramp his party spirits.</p> <p>\"I've had a few good nights out with, and the headaches to prove it,\" the friend said. \"However, he is quite sensible and naturally quiet.

      "bodyText": "Edward Heath, prime minister from 1970 to 1974, was widely considered unelectable until elected. Margaret Thatcher, PM from 1979 to 1990, was way behind her Labour opponent James Callaghan in the popularity polls of 1979, but was elected. John Major, PM from 1990 to 1997, took over from Thatcher in 1990, and was re-elected in 1992, although the bookmakers at Ascot were offering 6-1 against the Tories the day before the election. The latest British candidate to be considered unelectable is Ed Miliband. We shall see. His luck may turn. In David Cameron he has an opponent who is manifestly losing his nerve. A prime minister who can sack his attorney general, Dominic Grieve, because the latter believes in the European court of human rights (which has nothing to do with Brussels), and who cannot accept the wise advice of such an elder statesman as Kenneth Clarke, is giving too many sops to the Eurosceptic Cerberus that is the Tory right wing. When chancellor (1993-97), Clarke took pride in the way that the budget deficit (for current spending) came down each year, and he did not yield to colleagues who urged an irresponsible pre-election budget. Those were years of sustained expansion after the recession of 1990-92. As a cabinet member until recently, Clarke must have heard the remark George Osborne is reported to have made to colleagues about his wish for a pre-election boom in house prices. It was certainly noteworthy that in his recent interview in this newspaper, Clarke complained of the \"ludicrous cycle of ridiculous housing booms followed by housing crashes\". The former chancellor was pretty forthright about the present economic recovery. \"It's not firmly enough rooted on a proper balance between manufacturing and a wide range of services and financial services,\" he said, adding that the banking crisis was not resolved and \"we don't want to be a low-wage, low-productivity, long-hours economy\". This is hardly a recovery to be proud of. And because the coalition was so savage in its programme of fiscal austerity \u2013 knocking on the head an economy that was, in fact, recovering until it took over \u2013 output is only just back to its pre-crisis peak, and real incomes and living standards are way below. Much is made of the way the chancellor has continually missed his fiscal targets, but they are so severe that they aggravated the depression brought on by the great financial crisis. In its annual report, the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) states: \"Output is about 12.5% below the path implied by a continuation of the pre-crisis trend in the United States and 18.5% in the United Kingdom.\" This reflects the fact that fiscal policy has been more restrictive here than in the US, with George Osborne actually boasting to the rightwing American Enterprise Institute in April that \"the pace of our fiscal consolidation over the last four years has been steady, with an average annual reduction in the cyclically adjusted primary balance of around 1.6% of GDP according to the IMF \u2013 the largest and most sustained of any major economy.\" The chief economist at the BIS in the runup to the crisis was Bill White, who issued many a perceptive warning about the unsustainability of asset-price inflation at the time. White has retired from that role, but the BIS continues to produce an eminently readable report, if to my mind it is too dismissive of the risks of deflation, most notably in the eurozone. That the Bank of England is talking more and more about the possibility of increases in interest rates must be music to the ears of the BIS, generally known as \"the central bankers' bank\". While wanting tighter monetary (and fiscal!) policies generally, the BIS does at least concede that the G20 economic stimulus of 2009 \"prevented the financial system and the economy from plunging into a tailspin\" adding: \"this is what crisis management is all about\". The question is whether, at this stage of what one hopes is emergence from the crisis, policymakers are managing things properly. It seems to me that in Britain economic policy is all over the place. Politically, the general assumption is that another year of rapid growth will work to the advantage of the Conservative party; but I wonder. At the moment, although living standards and real incomes remain badly squeezed for the majority of the population, the opinion polls are so close that, if this were a traditional electoral cycle, a British government might be tempted to \"cut and run\" with an autumn election. This possibility has been ruled out by a coalition deal. The case for expecting an extended period of growth depends partly on how much spare capacity, and potential output, there is in the economy before it might run into trouble on the inflation front. As the BIS says: \"Potential output is a key variable for policymakers. It contains information about the sustainability of output and the degree of economic slack. Unfortunately potential output is not observable, not even ex post.\" (My italics.) At the Bank of England they seem to operate in an atmosphere of highly paid agnosticism. They also worry about the impact on recovery, and personal finances, of tighter monetary policy. Pollsters say that the big worry for Labour is its reputation for economic competence. I have many times pointed out that the degree of mess inherited by the coalition was much exaggerated. The way things are shaping up, we may find that over the next 10 months, the coalition's reputation for economic competence takes a serious knock. Meanwhile, Ed Miliband has time to try to establish himself as a more credible potential leader than seems to be the case at the moment.",

The prime minister may be driven around in a Jag, but the car firm, along with Tetley and Corus, is run by Ratan Tata, the Indian chairman of Tata Motors. Jaguar has prospered under foreign ownership. Sales are up by 100,000 vehicles to almost 360,000 \u2013 80% of them overseas. And with greater sales has come continued investment in UK plants and jobs. That, however, is not necessarily the norm with a foreign takeover.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/19/cadbury-board-agrees-kraft-sale\">When Cadbury's was taken over by the American confectionery giant Kraft in a \u00a312bn deal in 2010,</a> it promised to keep its Somerdale factory in Somerset open. Just a week after the purchase, Cadbury's new American owners lamented that, in fact, Somerdale would need to close after all. Market forces, you see.</p> <p>The debate about foreign takeovers has been stoked again by Pfizer's unsuccessful attempt to buy AstraZeneca, the British-based pharmaceutical group, for nearly \u00a370bn. Following the outcry over the possible deal, and the fear of UK job losses, the business secretary, Vince Cable, promised to strengthen Britain's takeover rules, to make it harder for international bidders to renege on promises made during a deal. The government will consult on the changes, and new laws are set to be introduced before the general election in 2015.</p> <h2>Wall Street upon Thames</h2> <p>In the 1980s, the Americans arrived. Margaret Thatcher deregulated the City and Merrill Lynch, Chase Manhattan and Lehman Brothers, to name a few, snapped up ancient institutions, replacing the clubby atmosphere of the Square Mile with the rapacious, bonus-grabbing culture that has dominated the financial centre ever since. An influx of capital to London ensured it pulled clear of continental rivals as the place for the big beasts of the financial services sector to do business. When the sub-prime mortgage model went bust in the US, though, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. Merrill Lynch, AIG, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, HBOS, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Fortis, Hypo and Alliance &amp; Leicester all came within a whisker of doing so, and had to be rescued. America's problems hit nowhere harder than London.</p> <h2>Out of England's league</h2> <p>\"We know a little of the history at City and while we want to bring in the best players in the world, we also want to see the academy continue to develop talent and want to give Mark Hughes [the manager] the chance to bring homegrown players into the team,\" said Sheik Mansour, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family, on the day the family purchased Manchester City football club five years ago.</p> <p>Eighteen months later, Hughes, a former Welsh international, was sacked. City made it through to the last 16 of the Champions League last season, for the first time in their history, only to play an 11 against CSKA Moscow that didn't contain a single English, or home nation, player.</p> <p>Across the Premier League, the proportion of homegrown players has dropped to around a third, while 11 out of 20 Premier League clubs have foreign owners.</p> <p>Talking to a House of Lords select committee last year, the chief executive of the Premier League, Richard Scudamore, insisted that were no grounds for concern about the domestic league.</p> <p>\"There is a huge association with it being quintessentially English,\" Scudamore said. \"The overseas owners and players buy into that.

      "bodyText": "Great British companies Jaguar, Tetley and Corus steel. Great British companies? Not really. The prime minister may be driven around in a Jag, but the car firm, along with Tetley and Corus, is run by Ratan Tata, the Indian chairman of Tata Motors. Jaguar has prospered under foreign ownership. Sales are up by 100,000 vehicles to almost 360,000 \u2013 80% of them overseas. And with greater sales has come continued investment in UK plants and jobs. That, however, is not necessarily the norm with a foreign takeover. When Cadbury's was taken over by the American confectionery giant Kraft in a \u00a312bn deal in 2010, it promised to keep its Somerdale factory in Somerset open. Just a week after the purchase, Cadbury's new American owners lamented that, in fact, Somerdale would need to close after all. Market forces, you see. The debate about foreign takeovers has been stoked again by Pfizer's unsuccessful attempt to buy AstraZeneca, the British-based pharmaceutical group, for nearly \u00a370bn. Following the outcry over the possible deal, and the fear of UK job losses, the business secretary, Vince Cable, promised to strengthen Britain's takeover rules, to make it harder for international bidders to renege on promises made during a deal. The government will consult on the changes, and new laws are set to be introduced before the general election in 2015. Wall Street upon Thames In the 1980s, the Americans arrived. Margaret Thatcher deregulated the City and Merrill Lynch, Chase Manhattan and Lehman Brothers, to name a few, snapped up ancient institutions, replacing the clubby atmosphere of the Square Mile with the rapacious, bonus-grabbing culture that has dominated the financial centre ever since. An influx of capital to London ensured it pulled clear of continental rivals as the place for the big beasts of the financial services sector to do business. When the sub-prime mortgage model went bust in the US, though, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. Merrill Lynch, AIG, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, HBOS, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Fortis, Hypo and Alliance &amp; Leicester all came within a whisker of doing so, and had to be rescued. America's problems hit nowhere harder than London. Out of England's league \"We know a little of the history at City and while we want to bring in the best players in the world, we also want to see the academy continue to develop talent and want to give Mark Hughes [the manager] the chance to bring homegrown players into the team,\" said Sheik Mansour, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family, on the day the family purchased Manchester City football club five years ago. Eighteen months later, Hughes, a former Welsh international, was sacked. City made it through to the last 16 of the Champions League last season, for the first time in their history, only to play an 11 against CSKA Moscow that didn't contain a single English, or home nation, player. Across the Premier League, the proportion of homegrown players has dropped to around a third, while 11 out of 20 Premier League clubs have foreign owners. Talking to a House of Lords select committee last year, the chief executive of the Premier League, Richard Scudamore, insisted that were no grounds for concern about the domestic league. \"There is a huge association with it being quintessentially English,\" Scudamore said. \"The overseas owners and players buy into that. They are buying something very authentic, something that has been there since 1888. David Cameron talks about Britain being open for business. If this country does business overseas, these people have to be able to do business here.\" Foreign influence When the Tories unveiled Jim Messina, the electoral strategist behind Barack Obama's victories, as their new star consultant, many a Labour nose was put out of joint. \"We'll have someone similar soon enough,\" insisted a senior Ed Miliband aide.

      "bodyText": "American billionaire oil magnate J Paul Getty once said, \"If you can count your money, you don't have a billion dollars.\" Yet even for us non-billionaires, keeping a handle on how much cash we have can be difficult. Keeping a record on paper or on a spreadsheet and manually noting every single purchase and expenditure is time consuming. Some banks offer fancy online visualisations of your current account. Others will send you text reminders when your funds drop below a specified level. But when you hold accounts at different banks \u2013 not to mention credit cards, store cards and all the rest \u2013 the usefulness of these services pales. You might be pleased to hear that this situation is beginning to change. It is becoming possible for users to see \u2013 in real time, on one screen \u2013 all their account data at different financial institutions. The formal name for this service is \"account aggregation\". It's been around in the US for nearly a decade but is now making a splash in the UK thanks to a plethora of new \u2013 and often free \u2013 apps for iPhone and Android devices. The apps aim to help you answer basic questions about your finances \u2014 Am I overspending at Waitrose? Do I need to cut back on eating out? Has joining Amazon Prime been a false economy? Besides providing useful insights, the free apps are easy to set up \u2013 just enter your online banking credentials and you're done. But there's no such thing as a free lunch, and this may explain why they're not catching on as quickly as they might. A look at the most popular UK smartphone banking apps reveals that while all seek to collect large amounts of financial data on their users, not all companies treat your data the same way. While some app providers earn money by charging you to use their services, \"free\" app providers earn money by essentially selling your data. Britain's most popular personal finance app is OnTrees. The free iPhone app aggregates credit card, loan, billing and current account data to show users how they are spending their money. Money Dashboard is another free app offering a similar service. Both apps \u2013 like nearly all UK banking apps \u2013 run on a US-based platform called Yodlee, a major data-cloud service provider to global banks. It also sells data feeds of UK bank customers to UK app startups that hope to make money by selling insights into your spending habits. But not all UK banks use Yodlee, and if that's the case the apps will ask you for your bank account log-in details and pass this data on to Yodlee, which will collect (or \"scrape,\" in industry parlance) account information from your online banking platform, then save it on Yodlee's servers. Yodlee's data \u2013 both the direct bank feeds and its screen scrapes \u2013 are updated many times a day, and may even be real-time in some cases. Yodlee feeds this to UK app providers such as OnTrees, which crunch the numbers and then send those impressive pie charts and graphs of your spending through the ether to your iPhone. OnTrees says its free app has helped thousands reach their savings and spending goals. But if you think OnTrees and its ilk are altruistic financial fairy godmothers, think again. If you read the privacy policies of OnTrees or Money Dashboard, it's clear that in exchange for their free apps, you are granting them access to your personal financial data. Or, more precisely, a licence to monetise your data as they see fit. OnTrees's privacy policy says it will analyse your bank data \"to provide information about third-party products or services that you might find interesting; and use the content to create and analyse aggregated data about their users provided that you are not identifiable from the aggregated data\". Money Dashboard's privacy policy is clearer: \"We also use personal information in performing statistical analysis of users' behaviour as a whole; and to help in the creation of anonymised statistical data which we may use at our discretion (including licensing to third parties).\" Charlotte Oates, marketing and communications manager at OnTrees, says her company is trying to strike a balance between providing users with a free service and generating revenue. \"At the moment we're not sharing the data with anyone because we're in the early stages of our business,\" she tells me. But OnTrees \u2013 which was acquired by financial service comparison site Moneysupermarket in April \u2013 might eventually leverage user data to sell financial products through Moneysupermarket, says Oates. Under this scenario, OnTrees would collect a commission on any sales leads that it might generate. \"There's a dashboard in OnTrees that shows how much money has come into your account over the last 30 days and how much has gone out,\" Oates explains. \"If we see that over the past 90 days more money has come into someone's account than gone out, we could tell the customer 'why don't you think of opening one of these savings accounts?' That's the sort of recommendation we plan to make. But it's not something we are currently doing.\" Jeffrey Chester of the Centre for Digital Democracy is sceptical of OnTrees and its parent company, Moneysupermarket. \"Whatever OnTrees is saying needs to be looked at in the context of what its owner, Moneysupermarket, is actually doing,\" Chester says. \"Its business model today might very well be narrow, but it is part of a larger financial apparatus that's designed to sell your data. These apps are digital Trojan horses. They are promising you the convenience of an effective online tool but they are really there to spy on you and engage in predatory lending practices, which the UK has a large problem with.\" While apps like OnTrees remain free, the value of such companies grows with every additional bit of data they collect. And although there are not yet any global standards for attaching a monetary value to data, this seems likely to change. As a World Economic Forum report pointed out some years back: \"Personal data will be the new 'oil' \u2013 a valuable resource of the 21st century. It will emerge as a new asset class touching all aspects of society.\" Oates at OnTrees agrees: \"Data is a huge asset right now. It's absolutely a marketable asset. When we originally set up the business we knew that the data we would be getting from our customers would be very valuable.\" But she says the company risks alienating its users if it uses the data indiscriminately. \"People in the UK care a lot about privacy. A lot of our customers call us to ask how we will use their data. I think there are big concerns. We're focused on growing our market and our user-base right now, before we would start challenging the privacy relationship we have with our users.\" App makers might want to adopt clearer and more straightforward data usage policies to address privacy concerns. A good place to start is to do away with the term \"anonymised statistical data\" \u2013 a prevalent but essentially meaningless term that appears over and over in apps' terms of use. Professor Latanya Sweeney of Harvard University proved the term meaningless more than a decade ago when she demonstrated that 87% of all Americans could be uniquely identified using only three bits of information: their postcodes, birth dates and gender. So now imagine how much these free apps might know about you if you give them access to all your credit cards, bank accounts, and loans. Throw in GPS location data that the apps might also collect and you have a pretty complete picture of a person's life. As UK finance app developers consider ways to make money from the vast pools of data they hold on users, they are closely following how a Zurich-based startup is moving ahead with its own monetisation plans. The Numbrs app \u2013 available only in Germany at the moment \u2013 resembles OnTrees, with one added feature: you can make payments and move money to and from your bank accounts from within the app. The company says it has begun testing ways to use the trove of data it collects on its users to help insurance companies better assess risk when selling health, life, and liability insurance policies. So if you're spending too much money at McDonald's, or visiting your local pub too many times a month, Numbrs will know \u2013 and so will your insurance company. Charlotte Oates of OnTrees said she doesn't see her company going in this direction because of privacy concerns in the UK. \"That's probably not something that we would do at the moment. There are big security concerns in the UK, and it's a very different market. People here are still a little hesitant to move their money around with apps and use their data this way.\" But not all UK finance apps seek to monetise your data. Xero, a cloud-based accounting software provider, promises to save small-business owners time and headaches by storing their bills, invoices and account data in its cloud \u2013 for a monthly fee. \"What most small businesses lack is a way to easily upload their banking data,\" Gary Turner of Xero told me. \"They have usually had to enter the data manually or download a CSV file and then key it into accounting software.\" Xero collects financial data through Yodlee's platform as well as through direct feeds to banks. But since it charges \u00a39.25 a month, it doesn't have to sell users' data \u2013 though Xero does collect data on them so that it can provide \"relevant insights\" to its small-business users, Turner explains. \"We found, for example, that customers who put 30-day payment terms on their invoices typically get paid in 45 days,\" Turner says. \"We wanted to share this insight with our customers. We were able to tell our customers, 'If you want to get paid in 30 days, put 15 days on your invoices'.\" Clearly, UK customers should read privacy policies of apps and weigh the risk to their privacy before downloading. Yet in some cases, merely logging into your online bank account means you are interfacing with Yodlee's platform, since so many banks use Yodlee. Should you worry about Yodlee delving into your data? Robert Courtneidge, a mobile payments specialist and lawyer representing Yodlee in the UK at LockeLord LLP, says not. \"Yodlee is a technical service provider on behalf of the banks,\" he explains. \"They present themselves as a company that can hold your data more securely than your bank can.\" Services like Yodlee and its competitors are regulated in the US by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. The EU, for its part, is working on a payments directive that will regulate aggregate services like Yodlee if the next EU parliament votes to approve the draft rules. Whether or not the regulatory landscape adapts, Courtneidge thinks aggregation is here to stay. He also sees a new trend emerging: simple smartphone apps that allow people to send money to friends, family and local businesses. Such apps \u2013 originally developed for customers without bank accounts in African markets \u2013 are getting a push in Europe from banks and private equity investors. The idea is that they would replace cash for small purchases, and allow for integration with personal finance apps, so users could gain a clearer understanding of their spending. In April major banks in the UK began supporting Paym, a \"peer-to-peer (P2P) payments system\" app that allows people to send money using only a mobile phone number. But is it really easier than cash? Courtneidge isn't so sure: \"At this point it takes longer to send five quid through one of these mobile apps \u2013 both people have to sign up for them \u2013 than simply giving someone cash.\" However, banks saw Bitcoin's surge in popularity as a wake-up call. Their response has been to push their own P2P systems to traditionally cash-only small businesses \u2013 such as tanning salons, pop-up shops and corner stores \u2013 that might have considered accepting Bitcoin. Courtneidge thinks P2P startups will try to make mobile payments an appealing and hi-tech replacement for cash by making them extremely easy to use \u2013 and even wearable. \"P2P will probably be in all wearable technology,\" Courtneidge tells me. \"It will take the form of a wristband or a retina chip in your eye. That's where it's all headed.\" Yet as banks and P2P startups make the case for a cashless society, more people in the UK are actually turning to cash. For many, doing business with currency provides just as clear an insight into one's personal finance situation as do apps. Indeed, a recent report by the Payments Council and Link, which runs the UK's cash machines, found that cash payments still accounted for 52% of all payments in 2013. Which lends credence to the idea that even in an age of mobile wallets and smartphone finance apps, cash may still be king.",

Or, more precisely, a licence to monetise your data as they see fit.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ontrees.com/PrivacyPolicy#termsAndConditions\" title=\"\">OnTrees's privacy policy</a> says it will analyse your bank data \"to provide information about third-party products or services that you might find interesting; and use the content to create and analyse aggregated data about their users provided that you are not identifiable from the aggregated data\". <a href=\"https://www.moneydashboard.com/\" title=\"\">Money Dashboard's privacy policy</a> is clearer: \"We also use personal information in performing statistical analysis of users' behaviour as a whole; and to help in the creation of anonymised statistical data which we may use at our discretion (including licensing to third parties).\"</p> <p>Charlotte Oates, marketing and communications manager at OnTrees, says her company is trying to strike a balance between providing users with a free service and generating revenue. \"At the moment we're not sharing the data with anyone because we're in the early stages of our business,\" she&#xa0;tells&#xa0;me.</p> <p>But OnTrees \u2013 which was acquired by financial service comparison site Moneysupermarket in April \u2013 might eventually leverage user data to sell financial products through Moneysupermarket, says Oates. Under this scenario, OnTrees would collect a commission on any sales leads that it might generate.</p> <p>\"There's a dashboard in OnTrees that shows how much money has come into your account over the last 30 days and how much has gone out,\" Oates explains. \"If we see that over the past 90 days more money has come into someone's account than gone out, we could tell the customer 'why don't you think of opening one of these savings accounts?' That's the sort of recommendation we plan to make. But it's not something we are currently&#xa0;doing.\"</p> <p>Jeffrey Chester of the <a href=\"http://www.democraticmedia.org\" title=\"\">Centre for Digital Democracy</a> is sceptical of OnTrees and its parent company, Moneysupermarket. \"Whatever OnTrees is saying needs to be looked at in the context of what its owner, Moneysupermarket, is actually doing,\" Chester says. \"Its business model today might very well be narrow, but it is part of a larger financial apparatus that's designed to sell your data. These apps are digital Trojan horses. They are promising you the convenience of an effective online tool but they are really there to spy on you and engage in predatory lending practices, which the UK has a large problem with.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-443062593\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/25/1406301081411/Shopping-001.jpg\" alt=\"Shopping\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shopaholics beware: your\u00a0phone could soon warn you if\u00a0you\u2019re overspending. Photograph: Tom Wang/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While apps like OnTrees remain free, the value of such companies grows with every additional bit of data they collect. And although there are not yet any global standards for attaching a monetary value to data, this seems likely to change. As a <a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_ITTC_PersonalDataNewAsset_Report_2011.pdf\" title=\"\">World Economic Forum report</a> pointed out some years back: \"Personal data will be the new 'oil' \u2013 a valuable resource of the 21st century. It will emerge as a new asset class touching all aspects of society.\"</p> <p>Oates at OnTrees agrees: \"Data is a huge asset right now. It's absolutely a marketable asset. When we originally set up the business we knew that the data we would be getting from our customers would be very valuable.\"</p> <p>But she says the company risks alienating its users if it uses the data indiscriminately. \"People in the UK care a lot about privacy. A lot of our customers call us to ask how we will use their data. I think there are big concerns. We're focused on growing our market and our user-base right now, before we would start challenging the privacy relationship we have with our users.\"</p> <p>App makers might want to adopt clearer and more straightforward data usage policies to address privacy concerns. A good place to start is to do away with the term \"anonymised statistical data\" \u2013 a prevalent but essentially meaningless term that appears over and over in apps' terms of use. <a href=\"http://www.gov.harvard.edu/people/faculty/latanya-sweeney)\" title=\"\">Professor Latanya Sweeney</a> of Harvard University proved the term meaningless more than a decade ago when she demonstrated that <a href=\"http://impcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Simple-Demographics-Often-Identify-People-Uniquely.pdf\" title=\"\">87% of all Americans could be uniquely identified</a> using only three bits of information: their postcodes, birth dates and gender. So now imagine how much these free apps might know about you if you give them access to all your credit cards, bank accounts, and loans. Throw in GPS location data that the apps might also collect and you have a pretty complete picture of a person's life.</p> <p>As UK finance app developers consider ways to make money from the vast pools of data they hold on users, they are closely following how a Zurich-based startup is moving ahead with its own monetisation plans. The <a href=\"https://www.numbrs.com/en/\" title=\"\">Numbrs</a> app \u2013 available only in Germany at the moment \u2013 resembles OnTrees, with one added feature: you can make payments and move money to and from your bank accounts from within the app. The company says it has begun testing ways to use the trove of data it collects on its users to help insurance companies better assess risk when selling health, life, and liability insurance policies. So if you're spending too much money at McDonald's, or visiting your local pub too many times a month, Numbrs will know \u2013 and so will your insurance&#xa0;company.</p> <p>Charlotte Oates of OnTrees said she doesn't see her company going in this direction because of privacy concerns in the UK. \"That's probably not something that we would do at the moment. There are big security concerns in the UK, and it's a very different market. People here are still a little hesitant to move their money around with apps and use their data this way.\"</p> <p>But not all UK finance apps seek to monetise your data. <a href=\"https://www.xero.com/uk/\" title=\"\">Xero</a>, a cloud-based accounting software provider, promises to save small-business owners time and headaches by storing their bills, invoices and account data in its cloud \u2013 for a monthly fee.</p> <p>\"What most small businesses lack is a way to easily upload their banking data,\" Gary Turner of Xero told me. \"They have usually had to enter the data manually or download a CSV file and then key it into accounting software.\"</p> <p>Xero collects financial data through Yodlee's platform as well as through direct feeds to banks. But since it charges \u00a39.25 a month, it doesn't have to sell users' data \u2013 though Xero does collect data on them so that it can provide \"relevant insights\" to its small-business users, Turner explains.</p> <p>\"We found, for example, that customers who put 30-day payment terms on their invoices typically get paid in 45 days,\" Turner says. \"We wanted to share this insight with our customers. We were able to tell our customers, 'If you want to get paid in 30 days, put 15 days on your invoices'.\"</p> <p>Clearly, UK customers should read privacy policies of apps and weigh the risk to their privacy before downloading. Yet in some cases, merely logging into your online bank account means you are interfacing with Yodlee's platform, since so many banks use Yodlee. Should you worry about Yodlee delving into your data? Robert Courtneidge, a mobile payments specialist and lawyer representing Yodlee in the UK at LockeLord LLP, says not. \"Yodlee is a technical service provider on behalf of the banks,\" he explains. \"They present themselves as a company that can hold your data more securely than your bank&#xa0;can.\"</p> <p>Services like Yodlee and its competitors are regulated in the US by the <a href=\"http://www.ffiec.gov/\" title=\"\">Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council</a>. The EU, for its part, is <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?reference=2013/0264%28COD%29&amp;l=en\" title=\"\">working on a payments directive</a> that will regulate aggregate services like Yodlee if the next EU parliament votes to approve the draft rules.</p> <p>Whether or not the regulatory landscape adapts, Courtneidge thinks aggregation is here to stay.</p> <p>He also sees a new trend emerging: simple smartphone apps that allow people to send money to friends, family and local businesses. Such apps \u2013 originally developed for customers without bank accounts in African markets \u2013 are getting a push in Europe from banks and private equity investors. The idea is that they would replace cash for small purchases, and allow for integration with personal finance apps, so users could gain a clearer understanding of their&#xa0;spending.</p> <p>In April major banks in the UK began supporting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/10/payem-mobile-current-account-payments\" title=\"\">Paym</a>, a \"peer-to-peer (P2P) payments system\" app that allows people to send money using only a mobile phone number. But is it really easier than cash? Courtneidge isn't so sure: \"At this point it takes longer to send five quid through one of these mobile apps \u2013 both people have to sign up for them \u2013 than simply giving someone cash.\"</p> <p>However, banks saw <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/technology/bitcoin\" title=\"\">Bitcoin</a>'s surge in popularity as a wake-up call. Their response has been to push their own P2P systems to traditionally cash-only small businesses \u2013 such as tanning salons, pop-up shops and corner stores \u2013 that might have considered accepting Bitcoin. Courtneidge thinks P2P startups will try to make mobile payments an appealing and hi-tech replacement for cash by making them extremely easy to use \u2013 and even wearable. \"P2P will probably be in all wearable technology,\" Courtneidge tells me. \"It will take the form of a wristband or a retina chip in your eye. That's where it's all headed.\"</p> <p>Yet as banks and P2P startups make the case for a cashless society, more people in the UK are actually turning to cash. For many, doing business with currency provides just as clear an insight into one's personal finance situation as do apps. Indeed, a <a href=\"http://www.paymentscouncil.org.uk/media_centre/press_releases/-/page/2905/\" title=\"\">recent report by the Payments Council and Link</a>, which runs the UK's cash machines, found that cash payments still accounted for 52% of all payments in 2013. Which lends credence to the idea that even in an age of mobile wallets and smartphone finance apps, cash may still be king.</p>",
