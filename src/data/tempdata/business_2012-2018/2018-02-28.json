      "bodyText": "Wholesale gas prices in the UK more than doubled on Wednesday to their highest level in at least 10 years, as freezing temperatures across Britain drove a spike in demand and raised fears of a supply shortage. Within-day prices rose 108% to 160p per therm, after hitting am earlier peak of 190p per therm. Day ahead prices were up 6p at 95p. It comes as the severe cold snap continues and is forecast to worsen in some parts of the country. Experts said that while National Grid data suggested the market had a theoretical oversupply, physical shipments remained low. Britain\u2019s bigger energy companies typically hedge supplies many months in advance, so short-term price spikes should not automatically trigger higher prices for customers. But smaller suppliers, which account for about 20% of the market, are usually less hedged and can pass on price rises sooner. Bulb, which has about 300,000 customers, said on Tuesday that it would raise bills by 2.8% from 28 April. Fears over supply were exacerbated by outages at gas terminals in St Fergus, Scotland, and at Morecambe, which amounted to about 13m cubic metres of capacity. \u201cThese events may ease during the day but could also add to already acute demand for gas,\u201d said gas analysts at Thomson Reuters. A further outage at a Norwegian gas processing plant also contributed to the rise in UK wholesale prices. National Grid data on Wednesday showed demand for gas was 28% above the seasonal norm. A National Grid spokesperson said: \u201cDue to the cold weather some supplies have tripped but we\u2019re also seeing some come back. We are in communication with terminal operators and closely monitoring the situation. Market prices are high, reflecting the supply and demand position.\u201d Britain\u2019s ability to respond to short-term demand shocks has been hampered by the closure last year of Centrica\u2019s Rough gas storage site in the North Sea off the Yorkshire coast, the country\u2019s largest site. At its operational peak Rough could store about 10% of Britain\u2019s gas demand.",

      "bodyText": "The pay package of Unilever\u2019s chief executive, Paul Polman, grew by 51% to \u00a310.3m in 2017, and he is in line for a further rise in salary and potential bonuses under an overhaul of executive pay. Polman\u2019s 2017 pay deal includes a \u00a31m annual salary, \u00a32m bonus and \u00a36.4m in long-term bonus scheme shares, according to the group\u2019s annual report. Last year\u2019s deal totalled \u00a36.8m. The consumer goods company also revealed plans for a pay review which, for Polman, would raise his total fixed pay, including salary and benefits, by 5% to \u00a31.45m in 2018 and hand him up to \u00a39.9m in bonuses and shares a year. This would be a 23% rise in the potential for bonuses. Unilever said its remuneration committee was \u201cof the view that this increased maximum opportunity is fully justified by higher risk and more stretching performance requirements\u201d. But its position on pay risks stoking controversy during the upcoming annual general meeting season. Unilever said its new pay plans would come with a number of conditions, including the requirement for bosses to invest up to 67% of their annual bonus in Unilever shares, which they must hold for at least four years. The remuneration committee added that to earn the maximum pay under the incentive plan, bosses would have to \u201cdeliver truly outstanding performance over the full five years\u201d. Details of its pay plans follow results for the Anglo-Dutch group earlier this month showing a 9% increase in annual profits to \u00a37.1bn. Unilever, which is behind household brands such as Dove, Marmite and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice-cream, was boosted by a strong performance in emerging markets. The group fended off a \u00a3115bn takeover attempt from Kraft Heinz last year, after which it offloaded its spreads business for \u00a36bn to the private equity firm KKR. As part of a rethink after the Kraft approach, Unilever is reviewing its dual-headed legal structure and is expected to consolidate its headquarters in the UK or the Netherlands. A decision is expected in the next fortnight amid reports it could ditch the UK HQ.",

      "bodyText": "The Italian restaurant chain Prezzo is to close a third of its 300 UK branches, putting about 1,000 jobs at risk, the latest victim of the casual dining crunch. The chain, owned by the US private equity group TPG Capital, hopes to engineer a turnaround plan echoing steps taken by the burger chain Byron and Jamie\u2019s Italian to keep themselves afloat. Prezzo\u2019s creditors will be asked to approve proposals under which its restaurants\u2019 landlords accept rent reductions. About 100 unprofitable outlets are likely to close altogether, including all branches of its Tex-Mex offshoot, Chimichanga, in an attempt to put the business on a sound long-term financial footing. While landlords have yet to agree to the plan \u2013 known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) \u2013 it is expected to result in about 1,000 of the 4,500-strong UK workforce losing their jobs. Sources close to the company said staff would be transferred to the surviving restaurants where possible. Prezzo is one of several high-street restaurant chains to announce restructuring plans as firms battle factors including rising business rates, higher staff costs due to the \u201cnational living wage\u201d and fragile consumer confidence. Restaurants are also feeling the strain of stiff competition in the crowded casual dining sector, after an influx of private-equity backed firms. Last month, creditors agreed a CVA to rescue Byron, the chain whose upmarket offering caused embarrassment for the then chancellor, George Osborne, in 2013 when his expensive taste in fast food was called into question. The celebrity chef Jamie Oliver\u2019s chain, Jamie\u2019s Italian, also entered into a CVA this month. Prezzo\u2019s directors are understood to believe that the company is in better shape than either Byron or Jamie\u2019s Italian, given that it made a profit of \u00a35m last year and has \u00a311m cash in the bank. But the CVA will reshape the business, cutting out less profitable restaurants to reflect lower demand, indicated by sales that have been declining compared with last year. A CVA involves creditors agreeing to forgo some of what they are owed by a business rather than risk it disappearing altogether. In the case of restaurant chains, this usually involves landlords accepting reduced rent payments. A CVA has to be agreed by creditors with a combined claim of more than 75% of what the company owes, with the remaining 25% bound by the same terms if the deal goes through.",

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up, before wrapping up to face the snow outside.... Here\u2019s a closing summary: Toys R Us and Maplin have entered administration on the same day, putting more than 5,000 jobs at risk at two of the UK\u2019s best-known retailers. Administrator Moorfields said it was managing an \u201corderly wind-down\u201d of Toys R Us, which has about 3,000 staff, while PwC has been appointed to oversee the administration of Maplin, which employs 2,500 people. Labour called on the government to hold urgent talks with trade unions and the companies to ensure that jobs are safeguarded and address weakness in the retail sector. Moorfields said it still holds out hope of finding a last-minute buyer for all or part of Toys R Us, with its newer stores most likely to attract interest. Simon Thomas, a partner at Moorfields, said: \u201cAll stores remain open until further notice and stock will be subject to clearance and special promotions.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging customers to redeem their gift cards and vouchers as soon as possible,\u201d he said adding that customers should do so as soon as possible, before any store closures take effect. \u201cWe will make every effort to secure a buyer for all or part of the business. \u201cWhilst this process is likely to affect many Toys R Us staff, whether some or all of the stores will close remains to be decided. We have informed employees about the process this morning and will continue to keep them updated on developments.\u201d Here\u2019s our latest news story, which will be updated later. Good night, and good luck to those 5,500 employees. GW This piece may be useful for customers: Investors who loaned money to Toys R Us face significant losses. As Alan Higgins, the CIO of Cootts, points out, Toys R Us bonds were trading close to their face value until last summer - when the US parent sought bankruptcy protection. Over in the City of London, the FTSE 100 index of top shares has closed down 50 points or 0.7% at 7231. The selloff was mainly due to worries that American interest rates are going to rise sharply this year. But the problems at Toys R Us and Maplin did cast a shadow over traders. Consumer cyclical stocks fell 0.5%, while non-cyclicals fell almost 1%. Among smaller companies, Mothercare slumped 9% to a new all-time low of just 28.35p (back in 2010 they were worth over \u00a35). Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says today\u2019s twin administrations show that retailers are suffering badly. Other casualties could follow, she fears. Firstly, the squeeze on the consumer thanks to elevated levels of inflation, combined with wage declines in real term, which is causing consumers to rein in their spending on damaging level. And secondly, this reining back in spending couldn\u2019t have come at a worst time in the high street\u2019s history, as consumer habits change towards online shopping, favouring the likes of Amazon for their fast delivery and wider selection and more competitive pricing. \u201cThis brutal combination is hitting the high street hard. Stores are struggling at best, but if in the case of Toys R\u2019 US there is excessive additional burdens, then survival is questionable. It is very unlikely that these two retail giants will be the last casualties on the higher street, quite the opposite. With the online shopping revolution in full swing and tough economic conditions set to continue for the UK in the face of Brexit, there is a very good probability that more victims will fall. \u201c Heads-up: That \u2018open as usual\u2019 sign outside Toys R Us in Manchester isn\u2019t as new as I thought, sorry.... There\u2019s a chilly corner of intu Merry Hill shopping centre in Dudley, near Birmingham, that captures today\u2019s grim retail news. There, a Maplin and a Toys R Us store sit, side by side - with a sign in one of the windows confirming that the administrators are now in charge. Reader Shaukat Abbas kindly sent me these photos: Over in Manchester, my colleague Frances Perraudin has been speaking to Maplin customers about its fall into administration this morning (reminder, she visited Toys R Us earlier) She writes: Coming out of a small Maplin store on Manchester\u2019s Oxford Road, student Jack Poulton was clear that the business has been a victim of the rise of e-commerce. \u201cMost of the products that they sell, a lot of people \u2013 especially younger generations \u2013 will now look online for,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only reason I came in today is its proximity to the university and because I needed something immediately, otherwise I would have gone online myself.\u201d Poulton had visited the shop, which has been on the same site for more than 30 years, to see if they stocked a specific magnifying lens. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the manager knew instantly where to look. I would have no complaints about the service. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s very easy to find what they sell in Maplin on Amazon these days.\u201d Fellow student Mike Ellis said it was a shame that the expertise held by staff at electrical shops like Maplin was being lost. He said: \u201cSometimes you just want to be given advice, which these guys are very well trained for. Without that you are suddenly on your own.\u201d Inside the tidy and well-ordered store this lunch time, the staff \u2013 who usually outnumbered customers three-to-one \u2013 said they could not speak to the press, but confirmed that they had heard the news about the business that morning. Aslam Malik, who works for Manchester city council, popped in on his way past, after hearing that the company was going into administration, to see if they had a cheap DVD player for his nephew. He did not find what he was looking for. He aded: \u201cWhat they sell is quality stuff, but they are very expensive. \u201cYou can buy a printer for \u00a320 or \u00a330 from Tesco and Asda these days. I would usually look on ebay and at the big supermarkets for things like that.\u201d Update: I incorrectly wrote earlier that the Toys R Us branch in Manchester has hung an \u2018open as usual\u2019 sign outside. A reader has now got in touch, to kindly explain that the sign has been there for a while (!). Apologies... Toy sellers have been hit by a triple-whammy of problems recently, which all contributed to Toys R Us\u2019s predicament. The slump in the pound after the Brexit vote has driven up costs, while the growth of electronic devices, and the rise of counterfeit goods have eaten into sales. Amisha Chohan, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, explains: \u201cSales in the UK toy market fell by 2.8% to \u00a33.4bn in 2017, according to the British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA) and the NPD Group. This has been driven by a number of reasons; there has been a shift to screen games as opposed to physical toys. Licenses have been under-performing for a while, and there is the ever-growing concern of counterfeit toys. As with all retailers, toy shops have also been impacted by the shift to online sales. The impact of Brexit on the strength of the Sterling (particularly last year), together with inflationary pressures such as the increase in minimum wage, has also made a significant dent into their margins.\u201d The collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin into administration is going to ripple through the UK retail sector - and hurt companies in their supply chain. Helena Kanczula, Corporate Tax Director at accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg, explains that some suppliers will be left with unpaid bills. There is an order of priority regarding who ranks above who when a company goes into liquidation and trade creditors would be below secured creditors such as banks and the company\u2019s employees. There may therefore be limited funds available to distribute to suppliers. Research from YouGov has shown that the UK public lost confidence in Toys R Us after its US parent limped into bankruptcy protection last autumn. Amelia Brophy, Head of Data Products UK at YouGov, explains: \u201cCertainly, in the UK at least, people recognised the struggles the brand was experiencing. Its Buzz score (whether you have something positive or negative about a brand) had lingered around the +2 mark prior to September 2017. Since that time, its score has plummeted to a low point of -25. The knock-on effect of this is that the public opinion deteriorated. Its Impression score, which had stood around the +16 mark, dropped as low as -1. Most damaging of all of course, it that fewer people felt that they\u2019d consider shopping with Toys R US. Its Purchase Consideration (would you consider buying something from a brand) score among the general public had declined to +9 prior to the news it has entered administration, where once it had averaged a more respectable +15. It would have been hoping that the Christmas trading period would have injected some life back into the business, but our data indicates that it struggled to attract customers in the same way it once had, with only a small rallying in Impression score and Buzz. This is despite its Ad Awareness score jumping to +17, which does compete with previous years\u2019 levels.\u201d The British arm of Toys R US has been struggling since its US parent company filed for bankruptcy protection last September. The UK arm kept operating, in the hope of finding a buyer. That sounds laudable, but Philip Marshall QC of Serle Court argues that creditors could now lose out. The list of creditors includes the government (through its unpaid \u00a315m VAT bill) and the UK\u2019s pensions protection scheme (which picks up a \u00a337m deficit). Marshall explains why some tough questions need to be asked: \u201cOn the face of it one might say it is a surprise that the administration of the UK subsidiary of Toy R Us did not come sooner given the insolvency of its parent in the US some months ago and the well known difficulties of high street retailers in the face of online rivals. One question that may need proper investigation is whether the board acted properly in deferring administration in the face of market pressures (and ongoing losses) in the hope of securing a sale. Given that there is apparently a deficit to both the Revenue and Pension Protection Fund the outcome for trade creditors cannot be good and they may wish a proper investigation to be undertaken by the administrators to determine whether there is culpability here\u201d. Toys R Us nearly collapsed last December, before the company agreed to inject an extra \u00a39m into its pension fund. But today\u2019s administration means Britain\u2019s Pension Protection Fund takes over the scheme, which currently has a \u00a337m black hole. Ian Browne, pension specialist at Old Mutual Wealth, says existing pensioners will be protected, while current workers will lose some of their pension pot. \u201cMembers of the company\u2019s pension schemes need not panic. When schemes collapse they fall into the hands of the PPF, who have the responsibility for paying workers\u2019 pensions. Those who already reached the scheme\u2019s normal pension age will receive 100% of their pension. For those who haven\u2019t reached the normal pension age, the PPF will pay 90% of what their pension is worth, up to a cap. This cap is currently just over \u00a338,500 per year for someone retiring at 65, so it only affects the highest earners. Members of the scheme can still take early retirement and a tax-free cash lump sum. In fact, the way PPF calculates these can sometimes be more generous than a typical scheme. The problems at Toys R Us show that the era of retail parks may be over. So argues Dr Gordon Fletcher, retail expert at the University of Salford Business School. He says large out-of-town retail parks fail to meet customers\u2019 expectations today: \u201cWith ToysRUs and Maplin going into administration today, the constant change in the retail sector is now being felt in retail parks as much as the high street. These familiar brands have struggled to keep pace with the growing preference for online retail. But it is not just a matter of more people buying online, it is also what these retailers offered as their customer experience. Visiting a toystore with children is generally a fraught experience for most adults. Combined with the fact that a planned visit to a toystore will often require a degree of secrecy from the very same children, the failure of Toys R Us becomes much clearer. With a business model that imitated a grocery superstore that relied primarily on offering competitive pricing points in out-of-town locations there were few opportunities to discover something new or to create an environment that encouraged adult drivers to linger as long as their children wanted to. Our North of England reporter Frances Perraudin reports from a Toys R Us store in Manchester: Late on Wednesday morning, removal men Mark Connor and John Banks have popped into a tired looking Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us store on the outskirts of Manchester city centre for a \u201cnostalgia trip\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s like a relic from the 80s,\u201d says Banks. \u201cThe last time I came here, I was playing with transformers.\u201d Connor is keeping his eye out for Lego or Star Wars toys for his five-year-old son, but despite this morning\u2019s announcement that the company would be going into administration, he says prices at the shop in the Ancoats area of the city are still too high. \u201cI\u2019ve just compared one item they\u2019ve got over there to what\u2019s on ebay and it\u2019s \u00a340 there and you can get it for \u00a315 online.\u201d \u201cI think toy shops like this put smaller toy shops out of business, so I personally think [the company\u2019s collapse] might actually give the smaller toy shops a bit of a niche market,\u201d says Connor. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a good thing, because it\u2019s never a good thing when a big company goes out of business because loads of people lose their jobs, but it might regenerate a local toy shop mentality and help local businesses.\u201d The 30,000 square foot store was earmarked for closure before today\u2019s announcement, as the area is in line for redevelopment. On Wednesday morning only a small handful of customers could be seen wandering through its aisles of garish toys, with around 15 members of staff standing huddled chatting near the tills. Mike Meszaros, who works in branding, has come into the store to find an outfit for his son for World Book Day. \u201cI remember coming in here when I was seven years old and it was busy,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019d come in and it was like Hamley\u2019s. You\u2019d have staff demonstrating the toys. They\u2019d have stuff set up that you could play with and there would be toys everywhere that you could use before you bought them. It\u2019s not like that now. It\u2019s quite sad really.\u201d Labour MP Peter Kyle says Maplin\u2019s administration shows the wider impact of the weak pound on UK firms who import goods. Far from ushering in a bright economic future, the threat of Brexit has put jobs and investment at risk. Adam Deacock, a Barrister at Radcliffe Chambers, fears it won\u2019t be possible to save all Toys R Us and Maplin\u2019s stores. He explains: The administrators\u2019 statutory task is to rescue a company and its business as a going concern if this is possible. In practical terms this is highly unlikely, as a buyer will be unlikely to wish to take over their debts and liabilities or all of their stores, so the administrators\u2019 next task is to attempt to get the most they can for the assets. The hope for the companies\u2019 5,500 employees is that a buyer can be found for the businesses who will take over as many as possible of the stores, their employees and their pensions in one go, but the administrators\u2019 concern is simply to produce the best result for creditors. Deacock points out that the UK government could be hit in the pocket: \u201cAs taxpayers we should all be concerned as the immediate cause of Toys R Us\u2019 administration appears to be its unpaid VAT bill of \u00a315m and other unpaid tax debts can be expected. Another interesting tweet from Patrick O\u2019Brien, suggesting that Amazon will profit from Maplin\u2019s problems: Patrick O\u2019Brien of UK Research Director at Global Data Retail reckons that Smyths, Ireland\u2019s biggest toy retailer, was at least partly responsible for Toys R Us\u2019s demise. Smyths has been expanding in the UK recently, and almost doubled its UK pre-tax profits last year. It has offered a range of bargain toys, aimed at shoppers on a budget. Pat Lynes, business transformation expert and founder of Sullivan &amp; Stanley, fears that more retailers will follow Maplin and Toys R US. Lynes pins the blame on outdated management who haven\u2019t adjusted to today\u2019s business conditions: Toys R Us and Maplin facing collapse is sadly not surprising. They haven\u2019t re-engineered their operating model to focus on digital platforms and the customer experience. A lot of executives of these older corporations are sitting within organisational structures that were fit for the nineties and maybe the noughties, but aren\u2019t fit for today\u2019s rapid-pace, changing world. Without the ability to adapt quickly, sales will slide. It\u2019s the same Blockbuster story repeating - how many others will be next? Another example of why high street stores such as Maplin will be missed. Dr Coxon now works at Cambridge University, making silicon solar cells more efficient, so those projects clearly paid off. PwC have confirmed that they\u2019ve taken control of Maplin, and are looking for a buyer for some, or all, of the company. They also say that Maplin was hurt by the fall in sterling \u2013 which slumped against rival currencies after the Brexit vote in June 2016. Zelf Hussain, joint administrator and PwC partner, says: \u201cThe challenging conditions in the UK retail sector are well documented. Like many other retailers, Maplin has been hit hard by a slowdown in consumer spending and more expensive imports as the pound has weakened. \u201cOur initial focus as administrators will be to engage with parties who may be interested in acquiring all or part of the company. We will continue to trade the business as normal whilst a buyer is sought. \u201cStaff have been paid their February wages and will continue to be paid for future work while the company is in administration.\u201d Dom Tribe, retail sector specialist at supply chain firm, Vendigital, says Toys R Us failed to keep pace with changing shopping habits, including internet retail. Despite losing significant market share to competitors such as Amazon and Argos, Toys R Us failed to implement an effective E-commerce model with expedited shipping options and also continued to rely on its large warehouses. Opened in the 1980s and 90s, these have proven highly costly to run, with difficulties around managing stock levels, and have been outperformed by its new smaller stores. Toys R Us\u2019 relationships with key suppliers also hit the headlines over the last year, with the chain demanding long payment terms and exclusivity on certain ranges despite no longer being the key player in the market. Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff has written a good thread about why the collapse of toy stores matters: City analyst Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says retailers are suffering from \u201cstructural game-changers and a softening in consumer confidence\u201d, which can be fatal for firms who haven\u2019t adjusted. \u201cToys R Us has officially entered administration, with stores to remain open for the time being. The company failed to adapt and was stuck with a large portfolio of large warehouse shops. No experience for customers, no compelling online presence. A \u00a315m VAT bill did for Toys R Us in the end after another poor Christmas, but it was a systemic failure to move with the changes in the retail sector that really did for it. Maplin has also gone into administration in what\u2019s now a pretty torrid day for UK retail. In both cases the Amazon effect is all too clear to see, but there is more to it than that \u2013 there are retailers out there who are adapting and prospering. He also points out that Mothercare\u2019s shares have fallen today (currently down 7%, having been 12% lower earlier). Maplin, like Toys R Us, has struggled in the face of online retailers who were able to undercut its prices. But if the company does disappear from the high street, shoppers may struggle to lay their hands on a particular cable, battery or peripheral at short notice: Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u2019s Shadow Business Secretary, is urging the government to help Maplin and Toys R Us\u2019s employees: \u201cIt\u2019s devastating that over 5,500 High Street jobs risk being lost. This latest shock in the retail sector continues a worrying trend for our shopping streets and centres. \u201cThe Government must urgently meet with both the unions and the companies to ensure that these jobs are safeguarded. \u201cWorkers are suffering stress and anxiety not knowing what the future holds for them. In the event of job losses, the Government must act quickly to ensure all workers receive swift redundancy payments and are properly supported. \u201cThe Government must also urgently address problems across the retail sector.\u201d BREAKING: Electrical goods chain Maplin has also fallen into administration, in an increasingly dark morning for UK retail. This puts around 2,500 jobs at risk. Maplin, which has over 200 stores in the UK, was forced into administration after failing to find new funding -- less than an hour after Toys R US suffered the same fate. Graham Harris, CEO of Maplin, has blamed the slump in the pound since the EU referendum, saying: \u201cI can confirm this morning that it has not been possible to secure a solvent sale of the business and as a result we now have no alternative but to enter into an administration process. During this process Maplin will continue to trade and remains open for business. The business has worked hard over recent months to mitigate a combination of impacts from sterling devaluation post Brexit, a weak consumer environment and the withdrawal of credit insurance. This necessitated an intensive search for new capital that in current market conditions has proved impossible to raise. These macro factors have been the principal challenge not the Maplin brand or its market differentiation. We believe passionately that Maplin has a place on the high street, and that our trust, credibility and expertise meets a customer need that is not supported elsewhere. We will now work tirelessly alongside Zelf Hussain, Toby Underwood and Ian Green, from PWC, who have been appointed as the as Joint Administrators of Maplin Electronics Limited, to achieve the best possible outcome for all of our colleagues and stakeholders.\u201d A whopping VAT tax bill helped to push Toys R Us over the edge. The company owed \u00a315m, and a disappointing Christmas trading performance left it without enough funds to pay - triggering its fall into administration. Time for some nostalgia with Geoffrey the Giraffe, who starred in Toys R Us\u2019s iconic \u2018Magical Place\u2019 advert back in 1989: Here\u2019s Rob Davies\u2019s breaking news story on Toys R Us: Toys R Us staff discovered earlier this morning that their employer has fallen into administration. Moorfield\u2019s partner Simon Thomas, who is now running Toys R Us, says: \u201cWe have informed employees about the process this morning and will continue to keep them updated on developments. We are grateful for the commitment and hard work of employees as the business continues to trade.\u201d Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, has some advice for Toys R Us customers and staff, following today\u2019s news. \u201cIt\u2019s undoubtedly distressing news for employees of Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us especially because their fates have been uncertain for so long. Unfortunately they aren\u2019t the only retailer that has been struggling. \u201cAnyone who is worried about the future of their job should prepare themselves now. Check what redundancy rights you have and dig out any income or mortgage protection policies you hold just in case. \u201cToys \u2018R\u2019 Us have reported they will continue trading for now, however it\u2019s currently unknown whether they will still accept gift vouchers and offer refunds. If the administrators decide to suspend gift vouchers and refunds and you paid in cash you could be in for a lengthy battle to get your money back.\u201d Here\u2019s her guide explaining how credit card spending is protected in the UK: How does Section 75 protect your credit card spending? Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, says Toys R Us is another victim of the \u201cseismic structural changes\u201d hitting the UK high streets (such as rising operating costs and the threat from online retailers). He adds: \u201cPut simply, the retailer was too slow to embrace omnichannel, were burdened with too many stores and failed to deliver a retail \u2018experience\u2019 good enough to stand out from their competitors.\u201d Toys R Us\u2019s administrators haven\u2019t given up hopes of finding a buyer, for at least some of its 100+ outlets. In the meantime, existing stock will probably be offered at a sharp discount: Toys R Us customers are being urged to cash in any vouchers and gift cards ASAP, following its collapse into administration this morning. Toys R US has been dragged into administration by its \u201cunmanageable rent bill\u201d, according to the Financial Times. It says: Executives had been battling to raise cash to pay a tax liability that fell due this week, but the efforts collapsed after a number of private equity funds and restructuring specialists walked away. Insolvency specialists at Moorfields have begun the process of closing its British operations, which employ nearly 3,000 people and has an estimated funding shortfall of at least \u00a325m in its pension scheme. Retail analyst Fiona Paton points out that several other retailers have gone under recently: NEWSFLASH: Retailer Toys R Us has fallen into administration, putting around 3,000 jobs at risk. Press Association has the details: Administrator Moorfields has been appointed to conduct what it called an orderly wind-down of the company\u2019s store portfolio, although the firm insisted it is still seeking a buyer. Simon Thomas, Moorfields partner, said: \u201cWe will be conducting an orderly wind-down of the store portfolio over the coming weeks. \u201cAll stores remain open until further notice and stock will be subject to clearance and special promotions. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging customers to redeem their gift cards and vouchers as soon as possible. \u201cWe will make every effort to secure a buyer for all or part of the business.\u201d Toys R Us retailer has been hunting for a buyer for several weeks, but without success. The company, which has 105 stores in the UK, is a subsidiary of the eponymous US company, which filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada last year after amassing $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of debt. More to follow.... Asia-Pacific markets have closed lower, with Hong Kong\u2019s index down 2%, China off nearly 0.9% and Australia losing 0.7%. London-focused estate agent Foxtons has blamed a plunge in profits on Brexit uncertainty and stamp duty changes that have driven sales in the capital to near record lows. The company said waning consumer confidence against a backdrop of political uncertainty was weighing on the London housing market, driving a 65% fall in pre-tax profits in 2017 to \u00a36.5m. Foxtons said changes to rules in 2016, when the government imposed a new stamp duty surcharge on second homes, had also contributed to a weaker market and falling profits. Nic Budden, the chief executive, warned 2018 would be another tough year. \u201cWe are pleased to have delivered a performance in line with market expectations. However, sales activity in the London property market is near historic lows and this had a significant impact on our overall performance in 2017. UK broadcaster ITV has slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, after reporting a 10% drop in earnings. Statutory pre-tax profits fell to \u00a3500m last year, from \u00a3553m in 2016, highlighting the tough market for advertising. ITV blames the \u201cuncertain economic environment\u201d, which is overshadowing new CEO Carolyn McCall\u2019s \u2018strategic refresh\u2019. It has also stopped paying a special dividend to shareholders (they\u2019re still getting a normal divi, though). McCall sounds confident about the future, saying: We have a solid foundation to build on, and a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows gives ITV the flexibility to make the right strategic decisions for the long term future of ITV in an increasingly competitive environment whilst still delivering sustainable returns to shareholders. The prospect of several US interest rate rises this year has also hit American government bonds. As the price of US Treasuries has fallen, the yield (or interest rate) on the bond has risen. If borrowing costs are indeed going up, then investors want a higher return on their money. This means the gap between US and eurozone bonds has hit its widest level since the euro was created. European stock markets are all falling in early trading, as investors react to last night\u2019s testimony from Fed chair Jerome Powell. The main indices are all down around 0.5% - a modest move, but one that highlights the worries about US interest rates. In London, the FTSE 100 has been pulled down by mining stocks. They\u2019re suffering because Powell\u2019s upbeat comments have boosted the US dollar (thus pushing down commodity prices, which are priced in dollars). Powell\u2019s \u201cundeniable optimism towards the US economy\u201d, and his hawkish comments on interest rate moves, is hurting the markets, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: Due to Powell\u2019s strong outlook on the US economy, he considers it necessary to continue gradually increasing interest rates in order to prevent the US economy from overheating. On his hawkish tone, when asked the million-dollar question about 3 hikes or 4, Powell was quick to point out the improvements in the economy and his optimism that inflation will reach the bank\u2019s 2% target, in what can only be described as a hawkish response, which to many signalled 4 hikes could be on the cards in 2018. Powell\u2019s comments unleashed a wave of anxiety among equity traders, who rushed to sell out of holdings. Vive la France! Statistics body INSEE has just raised its forecast for French growth last year to 2%, up from 1.9%. That confirms that 2017 was the best year for France\u2019s economy since 2011. INSEE also confirmed that GDP rose by 0.6% in the last three months of 2017, matching its initial estimate. With all this talk about interest rate rises, it\u2019s worth remembering that America doesn\u2019t really have an inflation problem right now.... Stock markets across Asia have all fallen today, after Fed chair Jerome Powell\u2019s hawkish comments reignited interest rate hike fears. The Japanese and Hong Kong indices are leading the selloff, down 1,5% each. Here\u2019s the damage: Cautious investors are taking a \u201cguarded approach\u201d, says Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM: It is becoming increasingly clear that global stocks still remain highly sensitive to the prospects of rising inflation and interest rate fears. With Powell\u2019s testimony fuelling market speculation of higher US interest rates this year, stock markets remain exposed to downside risks as equity bears lurk in the background. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders have one thing on their mind today (well two, if you include the snow gripping the capital). How many US interest rates rises are heading our way, and how will the markets cope? For this, we can thank the new head of the Federal Reserve. As we covered in yesterday\u2019s blog, Fed chair Jerome Powell struck an upbeat tone about the US economy when he faced Congress yesterday. Powell told US lawmakers that he has become more optimistic about the US economic outlook since December, predicting some good years ahead with rising wages growth. If he\u2019s right, then it\u2019s good news for Americans, but potentially bad news for investors as the Fed is more likely to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation running out of control. The big fear in the markets is that the Fed could squeeze four rate hikes into 2018, ending the era of cheap money. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: A hawkish Jay Powell indicated US interest rates set to continue to rise in his first public outing as Federal Reserve Chair, prompting many to expect four rate hikes this year rather than three. Shares fell on Wall Street last night after Powell spoke, triggering losses in Asia overnight - and likely falls in Europe today. The FTSE 100 has just opened, down 36 points at 7245. Also coming up today: There could be Brexit fireworks , as the EU publishes the first draft of the withdrawal treaty. This may bring the sticky question of the Irish border into renewed focus - Theresa May has already declared that she won\u2019t sign anything that \u201cthreatens the integrity of the UK\u2019 There could be drama in UK retail too, with Toys R Us and Maplin both on the brink of administration.

Mike Meszaros, who was in the store to find an outfit for his son for World book day, said he could remember the shop in better days. \u201cYou\u2019d come in and it was like Hamleys,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d have staff demonstrating the toys. They\u2019d have stuff set up that you could play with \u2026 It\u2019s not like that now. It\u2019s quite sad really.\u201d Electrical goods retailer Maplin also went into administration on Wednesday morning. The dribble of customers coming out of one of the chain\u2019s small stores on Manchester\u2019s Oxford Road in the afternoon were similarly clear that the business had been a victim of e-commerce. \u201cMost of the products that they sell, a lot of people, especially younger generations, will now look online for,\u201d said student Jack Poulton. \u201cThe only reason I came in today is its proximity to the university and because I needed something immediately, otherwise I would have gone online myself.\u201d Poulton visited the shop, which has been on the same site for more than 30 years, to see if they stocked a specific magnifying lens. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the manager knew instantly where to look. I would have no complaints about the service. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s very easy to find what they sell in Maplin on Amazon these days.\u201d Inside the tidy and well-ordered store the staff, who usually outnumber customers three-to-one, said they could not speak to the press, but confirmed they had heard the news about the business that morning. Aslam Malik, who works for Manchester city council, popped in on his way past, after hearing that the company was going into administration, to see if they had a cheap DVD player for his nephew. He did not find what he was looking for. \u201cWhat they sell is quality stuff, but they are very expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can buy a printer for \u00a320 or \u00a330 from Tesco and Asda these days.

The Japanese carmaker said the majority of engines for the new cars would be manufactured at its Deeside factory in north Wales. Toyota\u2019s decision safeguards the jobs of about 3,000 workers across the two plants and is part of a \u00a3240m investment in the UK business announced by the company last year. The company has other European manufacturing plants in countries including Poland and France. Johan van Zyl, the president and chief executive of Toyota Motor Europe, said the decision to make the third-generation Auris in Burnaston demonstrated the firm\u2019s \u201cconfidence in the skills and capabilities\u201d of its UK workers. The UK car industry has said it needs urgent clarity on a transitional Brexit deal if it is not to risk Britain losing out to other European countries on investment as global automotive firms make key spending decisions. Commenting on Toyota\u2019s position, Van Zyl said: \u201cAs a company, we are doing what we can to secure the competitiveness of our UK operations as a leading manufacturing centre for our European business. \u201cWith around 85% of our UK vehicle production exported to European markets, continued free and frictionless trade between the UK and Europe will be vital for future success.\u201d The new Auris will be unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show on 6 March and will start rolling off the production line at Burnaston by the end of 2018. Last year, UK car production fell for the first time since the depths of financial crisis in 2009, as Brexit fears took hold and consumers turned their backs on diesel vehicles. A total of 1.67m cars were made at UK factories in 2017, down 3% compared with 2016 as demand for British-made cars dropped both at home and abroad. The industry trade body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, warned that 2018 was likely to be another tough year. The SMMT abandoned a target to build more than 2m cars a year by 2020 \u2013 breaking a previous record of 1.92m in 1972 \u2013 because of the scale of uncertainty posed by Brexit.",

    "webTitle": "ITV profits hit by steep fall in TV advertising", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "ITV\u2019s profits fell sharply last year as the Broadchurch to Love Island broadcaster reported the steepest fall in TV advertising in almost a decade. ITV\u2019s pretax profits fell more than 10% to \u00a3500m last year as TV advertising revenue, which accounts for about half of its revenues, fell 5% to \u00a31.6bn. In 2009, ITV\u2019s TV ad revenues fell 9.4% amid the advertising recession. The new ITV chief executive, Carolyn McCall, who joined from easyJet in the new year, blamed \u201congoing economic and political uncertainty\u201d for making brands wary about committing to advertising spending. McCall said that overall the broadcaster performed well as ITV Studios, which makes shows such as Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Victoria and The Voice, and growth in online TV helped push total revenues up 2% to \u00a33.1bn. Commenting on the bid for Sky by Comcast, which has in the past looked at ITV, McCall said it proved the value of strong producer broadcasters. \u201c[The bid] shows how much money there is around and how valuable content businesses and broadcast businesses are,\u201d she said. McCall is in the process of a \u201crigorous and thorough refresh\u201d of the strategy put in place by predecessor Adam Crozier seven years ago. \u201cThe world has changed since the last strategy was set out. Traditional broadcasters are no longer our only competitors for viewers and advertising,\u201d she said. The profit and ad revenue fall took the gloss off a strong on-screen performance last year as shows including Broadchurch, ITV\u2019s biggest drama, Victoria, I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here and breakout hit Love Island performed well. ITV\u2019s \u00a31.1bn programming budget is dwarfed by deep-pocketed rivals such as Netflix ($8bn), but McCall said it could remain competitive in the face of spiralling content costs. \u201cIt is a fact, you have to just deal with it,\u201d she said. \u201cITV is formidable at commissioning and doing it at a cost level not as eye-watering as some of the others. We are having to be much more nimble and agile in that world. On the other hand, a lot of the people spending [big money] commissioning shows are our customers [for ITV Studios].\u201d ITV\u2019s share price fell more than 6% as shareholders worried that a decision not to pay a \u00a3200m-plus special dividend after five years of payouts, as well as increased programming costs over the next two years, would hurt profits and returns to investors. \u201cMcCall has said she hasn\u2019t finished the strategy refresh and shareholders are worried she might reinvest the hundreds of millions they are saving [by] pulling the special dividend into areas such as boosting on-demand services,\u201d said Jonathan Helliwell, analyst at Panmure Gordon. \u201cThat all comes out of profits and would be a big hit that would impact investors.\u201d In addition, McCall revealed that the programming budget would rise by \u00a375m, to \u00a31.1bn, from 2017 to 2019 due to more investment in drama and sports rights. Analysts at Liberum said the move not to pay a special dividend could be the pre-cursor to making an acquisition, with Scottish ITV licence holder STV mooted as a target. ITV has previously bought Northern Irish holder UTV for \u00a3100m in 2015 and the Channel Islands franchisee in 2011. However shares in STV, which is now run by ITV\u2019s former strategy chief Simon Pitts, were down around 3% . STV is valued at \u00a3129m. McCall said she did not intend to \u201cuproot\u201d Crozier\u2019s strategy, which included spending over \u00a31bn buying production companies to reduce ITV\u2019s ad revenue dependency, indicating more deals will be on the way. \u201cCreating and owning quality content is a huge advantage,\u201d she said. \u201cITV is doing well\u2026 I am genuinely not trying to uproot everything because we don\u2019t need to. We now need to really look at what to do to make it really competitive going forward. Which areas we may have to upweight [such as] online and content and distribution and advertising.\u201d",

McCall is in the process of a \u201crigorous and thorough refresh\u201d of the strategy put in place by predecessor Adam Crozier seven years ago.</p> <p>\u201cThe world has changed since the last strategy was set out. Traditional broadcasters are no longer our only competitors for viewers and advertising,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The profit and ad revenue fall took the gloss off a strong on-screen performance last year as shows including Broadchurch, ITV\u2019s biggest drama, Victoria, I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/26/itv-love-island-victoria-ad-profits-advertisers\">breakout hit Love Island performed well.</a></p> <p> </p> <p>ITV\u2019s \u00a31.1bn programming budget is dwarfed by deep-pocketed rivals such as Netflix ($8bn), but McCall said it could remain competitive in the face of spiralling content costs.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a fact, you have to just deal with it,\u201d she said. \u201cITV is formidable at commissioning and doing it at a cost level not as eye-watering as some of the others. We are having to be much more nimble and agile in that world. On the other hand, a lot of the people spending [big money] commissioning shows are our customers [for ITV Studios].\u201d</p> <p>ITV\u2019s share price fell more than 6% as shareholders worried that a decision not to pay a \u00a3200m-plus special dividend after five years of payouts, as well as increased programming costs over the next two years, would hurt profits and returns to investors.</p> <p>\u201cMcCall has said she hasn\u2019t finished the strategy refresh and shareholders are worried she might reinvest the hundreds of millions they are saving [by] pulling the special dividend into areas such as boosting on-demand services,\u201d said Jonathan Helliwell, analyst at Panmure Gordon. \u201cThat all comes out of profits and would be a big hit that would impact investors.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, McCall revealed that the programming budget would rise by \u00a375m, to \u00a31.1bn, from 2017 to 2019 due to more investment in drama and sports rights.</p> <p>Analysts at Liberum said the move not to pay a special dividend could be the pre-cursor to making an acquisition, with Scottish ITV licence holder STV mooted as a target.</p> <p>ITV has previously bought Northern Irish holder <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/18/itv-to-announce-100m-takeover-of-utv-medias-television-channels\">UTV for \u00a3100m in 2015</a> and the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/oct/18/itv-plc-buys-channel-television\">Channel Islands franchisee in 2011</a>. </p> <p>However shares in STV, which is now run by ITV\u2019s former strategy chief Simon Pitts, were down around 3% . STV is valued at \u00a3129m.</p> <p>McCall said she did not intend to \u201cuproot\u201d Crozier\u2019s strategy, which included <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/30/itv-studios-production-advertising-market-slowing-growth\">spending over \u00a31bn buying production companies</a> to reduce ITV\u2019s ad revenue dependency, indicating more deals will be on the way.</p> <p>\u201cCreating and owning quality content is a huge advantage,\u201d she said. \u201cITV is doing well\u2026 I am genuinely not trying to uproot everything because we don\u2019t need to. We now need to really look at what to do to make it really competitive going forward. Which areas we may have to upweight [such as] online and content and distribution and advertising.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Two of the UK\u2019s best-known retailers, Toys R Us and the electronics specialist Maplin, have collapsed into administration on the same day, putting 5,500 jobs at risk. Administrators said they were still hoping to sell all or part of the two firms, which have struggled amid competition from internet giants such as Amazon and the weight of debts racked up by private equity backers. If no buyers can be found, about 3,000 staff at Toys R Us and a further 2,500 at Maplin are facing redundancy, potentially adding to a flurry of job losses so far in 2018. Carillion and the bedmaker Warren Evans have also folded, endangering thousands of jobs, while staff cuts have been announced at Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Marks &amp; Spencer, British Gas, Debenhams and New Look. As investors watched for signs of stress in other retailers, shares in the children\u2019s clothes firm Mothercare slumped by 9% to an all-time low. Labour called on the government to hold talks with trade unions, Toys R Us and Maplin to ensure that jobs were safeguarded. It urged ministers to address weakness on the high street, a week after official figures showed unemployment rising at its fastest rate for five years. Moorfields, the accountant which is managing the administration of Toys R Us, said it hoped to save parts of the business via a sale, with newer stores most likely to attract interest. Simon Thomas, a partner at Moorfields, said: \u201cWhilst this process is likely to affect many Toys R Us staff, whether some or all of the stores will close remains to be decided. We have informed employees about the process this morning and will continue to keep them updated on developments. \u201cAll stores remain open until further notice and stock will be subject to clearance and special promotions.\u201d Thomas added that gift cards and vouchers would be honoured but should be redeemed as soon as possible, before any store closures took effect. Maplin has also been put into administration after the breakdown of rescue talks with the billionaire Philip Day, owner of fashion chains Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Jaeger and Peacocks. Discussions between Day and Maplin\u2019s private equity owner, Rutland Partners, to save a chain with 2,500 staff and 200 shops broke down on Tuesday. The Maplin chief executive, Graham Harris, said: \u201cI can confirm this morning that it has not been possible to secure a solvent sale of the business and as a result we now have no alternative but to enter into an administration process. During this process Maplin will continue to trade and remains open for business. \u201cThe business has worked hard over recent months to mitigate a combination of impacts from sterling devaluation post-Brexit, a weak consumer environment and the withdrawal of credit insurance. \u201cThis necessitated an intensive search for new capital that in current market conditions has proved impossible to raise. These factors have been the principal challenge, not the Maplin brand or its market differentiation. \u201cWe believe passionately that Maplin has a place on the high street, and that our trust, credibility and expertise meets a customer need that is not supported elsewhere.\u201d But analysts highlighted the company\u2019s debt burden, under which it paid \u00a312m of interest last year on a \u00a363m loan from Rutland Partners at a rate of 15%. The insolvency expert Nick Hood, of Opus Restructuring, said: \u201cThe problem there is debt. It\u2019s another private equity screw-up.\u201d Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cIt\u2019s devastating that over 5,500 high street jobs risk being lost. This latest shock in the retail sector continues a worrying trend for our shopping streets and centres. The government must urgently meet with both the unions and the companies to ensure that these jobs are safeguarded. \u201cWorkers are suffering stress and anxiety not knowing what the future holds for them. In the event of job losses, the government must act quickly to ensure that all workers receive swift redundancy payments and are properly supported. The government must also urgently address problems across the retail sector.\u201d The veteran retail investor Theo Paphitis also called on the government to monitor the situation closely. Like Maplin, Toys R Us has been hunting for a buyer for several weeks, but the formal appointment of administrators was announced on Wednesday. The 105-store chain, which arrived in the UK in 1985, is a subsidiary of the eponymous US company, which filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada last year after amassing $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of debt. The brand, which runs large out-of-town stores, has struggled to keep pace with shifts in shopping habits as Britons increasingly buy toys online or in supermarket aisles. The veteran retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \u201cToys R Us simply couldn\u2019t compete with Amazon and other online retailers with its shabby and expensive \u2018big box\u2019 stores. Consumers won\u2019t miss it when it\u2019s gone.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "London-focused estate agent Foxtons has blamed a plunge in profits on Brexit uncertainty and stamp duty changes that have driven sales in the capital to near record lows. The company said waning consumer confidence against a backdrop of political uncertainty was weighing on the London housing market, driving a 65% fall in pre-tax profits in 2017 to \u00a36.5m. Foxtons said that changes to rules in 2016, when the government imposed a new stamp duty surcharge on second homes, had also contributed to a weaker market and falling profits. Nic Budden, the chief executive, warned that 2018 would be another tough year. \u201cWe are pleased to have delivered a performance in line with market expectations. However, sales activity in the London property market is near historic lows and this had a significant impact on our overall performance in 2017. \u201cLooking ahead, we expect trading conditions to remain challenging during 2018, and our current sales pipeline is below where it was this time last year.\u201d Revenue at the firm, known for its its fleet of minis and cafe-style offices, fell 11% in 2017 to \u00a3118m. Foxtons slashed its dividend payout to shareholders to 0.7p a share for 2017, down from 2p in 2016. Budden said that despite the tough trading conditions, the London property market had \u201cattractive long-term characteristics\u201d. Foxtons is hoping that its lettings business will capitalise on the spike in the number of people in London living in private rented accommodation. Nearly 30% of private households now rent their home in the capital, double the level of a decade ago, according to the estate agent. New lettings arranged by the firm in 2017 were flat. Revenue within the division fell by 3% to \u00a366m as a result of lower rental rates in the market. Foxtons said prices had been driven lower by an increase in the supply of rental properties, after buy-to-let landlords rushed to complete purchases before the stamp duty changes in April 2016. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said Foxtons results made \u201cgrim reading\u201d. \u201cFor Foxtons it\u2019s all about how quickly the market in London turns around,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThere is a clear rationale for saying that the hot flows of capital that flooded London property and pushed up the pound in the years prior to the Brexit vote have cooled and won\u2019t be warming up any time soon. \u201cWhile ultimately this could be positive and create a more sustainable property market in London, investors in Foxtons may have to accept that the rampant price growth in the capital that drove shares in the good times is a thing of the past.\u201d The housebuilder Taylor Wimpey was more optimistic about prospects for 2018 after it had positive start to the year. \u201cWe have been encouraged by early trading patterns at the start to the year and despite some wider macroeconomic uncertainty, consumer confidence remains robust and market fundamentals are solid,\u201d said Pete Redfern, the company\u2019s chief executive. The constructor completed 14,842 homes in 2017, up 4.6%. It achieved an average selling price of \u00a3264,000, compared with \u00a3255,000 in 2016. However, pre-tax profit fell 5.8% to \u00a3555m after a one-off charge of \u00a3105m related to payments made to customers who bought Taylor Wimpey homes on a leasehold basis \u2013 an ownership structure that has been criticised as unfair on buyers. The government is proposing a complete ban on new houses sold as leasehold and reducing ground rents to zero.",

      "bodyText": "Top executives at Carillion were \u201cfantasists\u201d who assumed the company would receive fees that might not be paid, according to MPs. In the latest in a series of critical statements, a joint parliamentary select committee investigating the collapse of the construction firm also accused Carillion\u2019s former leadership of making a \u201clitany of excuses\u201d for the demise of the construction group. The comments came as the joint inquiry being conducted by the work and pensions committee \u2013 in conjunction with the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee \u2013 published conflicting accounts of Carillion\u2019s corporate dispute with Msheireb Properties, a Qatari customer that Carillion directors have accused of being a significant cause of the company\u2019s collapse in January. In previous evidence, the former Carillion chief executive Richard Howson \u2013 who was sacked after a profit warning last July but kept on by the firm as an executive \u2013 said he felt like a \u201cbailiff\u201d while trying to collect about \u00a3200m owed for Carillion\u2019s work on a project to redevelop downtown Doha. For their part, the Qataris have accused Howson of \u201cmisleading\u201d the joint committee, arguing that they believe the UK company \u201cowed Msheireb Properties a similar amount of money\u201d. Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, said: \u201cThis extraordinary exchange reinforces the impression that the upper reaches of Carillion were stocked with fantasists. It takes a special kind of optimism \u2013 that of a man kept on after his sacking to keep up morale \u2013 to classify money one hopes to earn in the future, on a challenging project, as money \u2018owed\u2019 to you. He cannot tell the difference between money he\u2019d like to be paid, he wishes would be paid, and money that is actually owed to him.\u201d He added: \u201cThe likes of non-executive directors and auditors are there to guide the company \u2013 and its books \u2013 back down to earth. In the case of Carillion it was, unfortunately, a crash landing.\u201d Correspondence published by the committees illustrates the extent of the breakdown in the relationship between the two companies. Howson had previously told the committee that an accounting provision taken against the Qatar contract in June 2017 had been triggered when Msheireb had \u201celected to appoint a third-party contractor to complete the works, which we disagreed with, at our cost\u201d. Msheireb wrote to MPs and stated that the switch occurred when it became \u201cobjectively clear that Carillion was unable to complete the works, and was not paying its subcontractors\u201d and the Qataris had \u201clittle option but to hire a new contractor\u201d, at cost to Msheireb. Rachel Reeves, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said: \u201cThe Carillion directors\u2019 litany of excuses for the collapse of the company is fast unravelling. While spiralling debt problems and failing contracts signalled the alarm to almost everyone but Carillion\u2019s directors and auditors, their former chief executive was jet-setting off to Qatar to chase a pot of gold that may never have existed. \u201cOnce again Carillion\u2019s directors appear to have shut their eyes and ears to the real problems at the company and failed dismally to take meaningful action to avert its tragic collapse.\u201d The exchanges emerged as another select committee inquiry into Carillion heard further evidence from former executives on Tuesday. The former finance director Emma Mercer, who had been named in Carillion board minutes released on Monday as the person who exposed the group\u2019s problems, told the a joint hearing by the public accounts committee and the public administration and constitutional affairs committee that she didn\u2019t consider that her intervention classified her as a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d. Before she was promoted to the firm\u2019s top finance role, and just six weeks after returning to the UK from a post in Canada, Mercer had raised questions last spring over the company\u2019s accounting practices. Carillion folded in January with just \u00a329m in cash on its balance sheet.",
