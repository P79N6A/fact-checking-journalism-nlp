      "bodyText": "And finally, Berkeley Group closed down 5.4% on the London stock market tonight, amid disappointment that it won\u2019t boost its house-building programme. Other housebuilders also suffered, with Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon both losing around 1.3%. David Madden of CMC Markets says: Traders received an insight into the psyche of Berkeley Group today after the company hit out at planning permission policies and buy-to-let lending practices. The homebuilder maintained their positive forecasts and stated that its position is \u2018resilient\u2019, but the commentary about the backdrop indicates some nerves. The company is focused on London and south-east England, and house prices are a touch softer now, which is also weighing on the stock. The broader FTSE 100, though, finished 24 points high, or 0.4%, at 7,164.14. Shares are higher on Wall Street too, with the Dow still up around 80 points (0.3%). That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting, GW Berkeley\u2019s announcement is still causing a stir on social media. Chris Blythe, CEO of the Chartered Institute of Building, isn\u2019t impressed: Here\u2019s more reaction: (that\u2019s \u00a33.3bn between 2016 and 2021 - not to be sniffed at!) The financial markets are pushing higher today, as the surge in US consumer confidence cheers traders. In London, the FTSE 100 is up 17 points, or 0.2%, as it meanders towards the end of the trading week. On Wall Street, the New York stock market has opened higher too. The Dow has gained 64 points, or 0.25%, to 24,938 points. Traders are sitting back and waiting for new fireworks from the White House on either tariffs, or staff changes (at pixel time, HR McMaster remains America\u2019s National Security Adviser, despite rumours he might be replaced soon). Here\u2019s the situation across the markets: I\u2019ll be back if anything major happens. Otherwise, best wishes for the weekend... Another sign that US citizens are feeling more optimistic: Newsflash: US consumer sentiment remains strong, in a sign that American citizens aren\u2019t worried about the risk of trade wars. The University of Michigan\u2019s monthly gauge of consumer morale has jumped to 102 this month, up from 99.3 in February. That\u2019s a 14-year high! The survey suggests that Donald Trump\u2019s economic programme, including recent tax cuts, are proving popular: In other news, pub chain JD Wetherspoon has sounded a cautious note. The group told the City this morning that it expects like-for-like sales growth to slow over the next six months, following a 6.1% rise in the last half-year. Chairman and founder Tim Martin also warned that Wetherspoon\u2019s faced higher pay, taxes and utilities bills in the months ahead. Martin, a vocal supporter of Brexit, has also been touring the media studios discussing Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. He told Bloomberg that claims Britain would suffer food shortages after a hard Brexit was \u2018utter and complete tosh\u2019. He argues that EU tariffs push up the cost of food imports (from outside Europe) into the UK. If we can get rid of those tariffs, incomes and standards of living in the UK will rise. Britain isn\u2019t the only country struggling to build houses. New data from America shows that the number of new house-building projects slumped by 7% in February, to an annual rate of 1.236 million. That\u2019s weaker than expected. The number of housing permits being doled out to US builders also fell, by 5.7%. Jefferies analyst Anthony Codling says the UK government should heed Berkeley\u2019s warning that it can\u2019t justify speeding up its house-building programme. Codling says: \u201cWhilst some view being a housebuilder as a licence to print money, it turns out that constructing homes is more complicated than building a printing press. \u201cWe need more homes, but when even the master craftsmen are constrained we need Government policy to help, not hinder.\u201d The government has recently announced some new steps; it is reviewing the UK planning system, in an attempt to close the gap between available land and the actual number of houses being built. If housebuilders such as Berkeley are unwilling or unable to boost their production, it will be harder for renters to make the jump onto the housing ladder. Over the last decade, sharp price rises in London and the South East -- where Berkeley operates - have made it tougher for first-time buyers, as these tweets show: Berkeley\u2019s reluctance to build more homes is a serious concern, says Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre. \u201cBerkeley themselves have said that the limit to production will be a blow to the housing market because of the need for so many more homes. The London market has fared the worst since Brexit and should this spill over to the rest of the market then it will be big blow to the government as limited production will do nothing to bring house prices to more affordable levels. Berkeley Group are still firmly at the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, after refusing to boost housebuilding output this morning. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says investors are disappointed with the company\u2019s stance, and wondering how the prime minister will respond: Berkeley Group\u2019s announcement not to expect additional growth on top of previously announced housebuilding plans has gone down like a lead balloon. Shareholders quickly sold out this morning as the housebuilder positions itself directly against Theresa May. Berkley group appear unfazed by government threats of snatching unused land and planning blocks should housebuilders refuse to ramp up the number of homes it builds. Berkeley group has pitched itself directly against the government citing building costs, limits of mortgage borrowing and prevailing economic uncertainty as reasons not to build more homes that it had originally planned. Just in: inflation across the eurozone has fallen to just 1.1% in February, down from 1.3% in January. That\u2019s good news for consumers across the euro area. But, it also means the European Central Bank\u2019s efforts to drives prices up - by injecting tens of billions of new euros into the system each month - haven\u2019t worked yet. Inflation across the wider EU was 1.3% in February. Britain suffered one of the highest rates, with prices rising by 3% year-on-year. Newsflash: The Bank of England has warned high street banks are starting to take increasing risks selling mortgages. The BoE is suggesting it could force them to boost their financial buffers to protect against losses. Threadneedle Street said almost a fifth of new mortgage lending was just below the limits set by its financial policy committee for banks to sell consumers a loan of no-more than 4.5 times their income. [that\u2019s the limit which Berkeley cited as a reason not to build more homes this morning] Putting lenders on notice over the increasing risks, the Bank of England said no action was required at this stage but that it would reconsider whether to force banks to hold more capital in June. The Bank has also revealed that its annual stress test for the major British banks would be almost identical to last year, when it concluded they would all be able to withstand a disorderly Brexit. Barclays, HSBC, RBS, Santander UK, Standard Chartered and Nationwide will be put through their third annual healthcheck this year, designed to spot warning signs in the banking industry to prevent a rerun of the financial crisis. The Bank said the 2018 test would include the same catastrophic economic scenario as was set in 2017, which was much tougher than the conditions seen in the financial crisis. The test includes a 4.7% fall in GDP, house prices crashing by as much as a third and interest rates rising to 4% (from 0.5% today). George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says a \u201cMexican stand-off\u201d is developing between housebuilders and the government. He explains: Theresa May is saying builders need to open up their land banks and develop more sites, while Berkeley is unwilling to aggressively ramp up production. With conditions in the capital starting to look more precarious, it\u2019s easy to see why Berkeley has reservations. After all, adopting overly ambitious strategies just before the market turns has caught out many a builder over the years. Its comments on the complexity of getting work started is a clear signal to the government that it believes the best way to move forward is not to churn through the land on its books, but to remove the red tape around the development process. Property Week agree, saying that: Berkeley Homes has positioned itself directly against prime minister Theresa May, by refusing to increase the number of homes it builds despite government threats to housebuilders to either build homes on their land or face planning blocks. Sarah Gatehouse, real estate tax director at Grant Thornton, tweets that the ball is back in the PM\u2019s court: Berkeley is confident of achieving billions of pounds in profits over the next few years, without having to boost its housebuilding programme. The company has reaffirmed its guidance to deliver at least \u00a33.3bn of pre-tax profits between May 2016 and April 2021. It will also return \u00a376.3m of cash to shareholders next week in dividend payments. That\u2019s on top of share buy-backs worth \u00a362.9m. Berkeley Group\u2019s refusal to boost its house-building efforts hasn\u2019t done down terribly well in the City. Shares in Berkeley are down almost 6%, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 this morning. One of Britain\u2019s biggest house-builders is refusing to bow to pressure from the government to build more homes. Berkeley Group told the City this morning that various \u2018market constraints\u2019 make it impossible to boost housing supply, beyond its current plans. Berkeley, which is focused on the South East of the UK, and London, blamed a string of factors, including: the cost of moving house, current mortgage lending limits, economic uncertainty changes to the tax rules for buy-to-let landlords the complexity of Britain\u2019s planning system. All this, Berkeley claimed, means it simply cannot justify \u201cthe step-up in Berkeley\u2019s production levels that these markets so badly need.\u201d That\u2019s a rebut to Theresa May, who two weeks ago challenged Britain\u2019s developers to do more to tackle Britain\u2019s chronic housing shortage. The PM warned that the government wouldn\u2019t tolerate sloth from housebuilders, saying: \u201cI want to see planning permissions going to people who are actually going to build houses, not just sit on land and watch its value rise. Berkeley, though, aren\u2019t caving in. Here\u2019s what it told shareholders this morning: The market conditions in London and the South East are unchanged from the first half with home movers and downsizers continuing to be constrained by high transaction costs, the 4.5x income multiple limit on mortgage borrowing and prevailing economic uncertainty. In addition, domestic buy-to-let investors, who buy early in the cycle and provide security of cash flow to enable complex, capital intensive developments to be brought forward, are further impacted by additional transaction costs and the removal of interest deductibility. These factors, together with the changing planning environment and the time and complexity of getting on site following planning approval, mean that Berkeley is currently unable to increase production beyond the business plan levels. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Trade war fears continue to loom over the markets today, with investors wondering if Donald Trump will soon announce fresh tariffs against China. The latest signs of turmoil in the White House aren\u2019t helping the mood on the trading floors either, with reports that national security advisor H.R. McMaster could be the next advisor to get the sack. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada says: McMaster had sided with Cohn in the unsuccessful attempt to talk Trump out of steel/aluminium tariffs and his WH exit is now widely seen as just a matter of time. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, has played down the story though.... So it\u2019s lining up to be a quiet morning in the City, while traders await developments. In the UK, the Bank of England will be releasing the details of this year\u2019s banking stress tests, which take place later this year. This will examine how Britain\u2019s biggest banks cope with a shock-horror scenario of a deep recession, rising unemployment and tumbling house prices. Do they have enough capital to cope?... The agenda: 9.30am GMT: Bank of England releases details of 2018 bank stress tests 10am GMT: Eurozone inflation figures for February 2pm GMT: US consumer confidence survey from the University of Michigan",

The chairman of JD Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, said drinks manufacturers were passing on the cost of the sugar tax, which comes into effect next month. \u201cSuppliers are passing it on to us and we are passing it on to the customer,\u201d said Martin, who complained the levy was adding to the financial pressures faced by pubs and restaurants. \u201c\u00a33m is the cost of the extra tax to the business, whether or not we pass it on to customers.\u201d Martin said the company faced rising costs in the second half of its financial year due to business rates and higher payroll costs. \u201cIt\u2019s an era of rising taxes for pubs and restaurants which is making life more difficult,\u201d he said. Martin could not resist a dig at Jamie Oliver, who campaigned for the introduction of a sugar tax but more recently has been closing branches of his struggling restaurant chain Jamie\u2019s Italian. \u201cJamie Oliver\u2019s sugar tax \u2013 which he got us to pay but can\u2019t afford to pay himself \u2013 is costing us \u00a33m, a bit more than the increase in business rates,\u201d Martin told the BBC\u2019s Today programme. His comments came as JD Wetherspoon reported pre-tax profits up by a fifth to \u00a362m on sales of \u00a3830.4m in the six months to 28 January. Like-for-like sales rose 6.1% during the period although that figure had slowed to 3.8% over the past six weeks. The sugar tax \u2013 designed to help combat child obesity \u2013 was announced by then chancellor George Osborne in 2016. Given the goal was to cut sugar consumption, Osborne gave drinks-makers time to alter their recipes but as of April they will be taxed at 18p per litre on drinks containing 5g of sugar or more per 100ml, or 24p per litre if the drink has 8g of sugar or more per 100ml. Earlier this week the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government\u2019s independent budget watchdog, said the amount the sugar tax was expected to raise for government coffers had more than halved due to the number of manufacturers that had reduced the sugar content of their drinks. The OBR has pencilled in \u00a3240m a year, less than half the \u00a3500m predicted back in 2016. \u201cThe sugar tax has been a great success and it has not even come in yet,\u201d said Duncan Brewer, a partner at consultancy firm Oliver Wyman. \u201cConsumers are more aware of sugar and there have been a raft of reformulations. It\u2019s a great example of a relatively benign intervention.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Men at Goldman Sachs earn more than twice the average hourly pay of women at the US investment bank\u2019s British business and take home much bigger bonuses, in the latest example of pay disparity in the City. The business\u2019s gender pay gap report, published on Friday under new rules designed to shine a light on big variations in earning power between men and women, reveal that women earn 55.5% less an hour than men by the mean average measure at Goldman Sachs International. The median pay gap was 36.4%. Although roughly the same proportion of men and women at the bank receive a bonus, women at GSI, which employs about 7,400 people who mostly work at its investment bank, receive on average 72.2% less than men (median 67.7%). The bank said that the gap reflected the fact that more men than women held senior positions \u2013 taking up 83% of the best paid roles. In contrast, women hold 62.4% of the lowest paid jobs. In a joint statement, Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, and David Solomon, the president and chief operating officer, said: \u201cAt Goldman Sachs we pay women and men in similar roles with similar performance equally. However, the real issue for our firm and many corporations is the under-representation of women and diverse professionals both in magnitude and levels of seniority. We have made some progress, but we have significant work to do.\u201d The huge pay gap at Goldman Sachs remains narrower than the 59% disparity revealed by HSBC on Thursday according to the mean average measure, which is calculated by taking all male and female wages and dividing them by the number of workers. The median gap was 29%. HSBC, which gave a provisional mean figure of 60% for 2018, has the widest pay gap of any major company that has reported so far. All private and public sector organisations and charities with more than 250 employees must submit pay gap figures to the government by April under a scheme introduced this year. About 2,450 have filed figures so far, but the legislation is expected to affect about 9,000 companies, which collectively employ more than 15 million people. Barclays International banking group has revealed a 48% mean gap; Lloyds 32.8% and the Co-operative Bank a 30.3% gap. Goldman Sachs said it was committed to ensuring women represented 50% of the global workforce \u201cover time\u201d. \u201cAn important first step is to have women make up 50% of our incoming analyst class \u2013 and we are working to achieve this goal by 2021,\u201d Blankfein and Solomon said. This article was amended on 29 March 2018 to correct HSBC\u2019s mean pay gap and to add median figures.",

According to the ONS, the gap between what UK male and female workers earn \u2013 based on median hourly earnings for all workers in 2017 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2017provisionaland2016revisedresults#gender-pay-differences\">stood at 18.4%</a>, up 18.2% from a year earlier.

We have made some progress, but we have significant work to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>The huge pay gap at Goldman Sachs remains narrower than the 59% disparity revealed by HSBC on Thursday according to the mean average measure, which is calculated by taking all male and female wages and dividing them by the number of workers.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned high street banks are taking increasing risks selling mortgages and commercial loans that could threaten the stability of the financial system if left unchecked. Threadneedle Street put banks on notice that it could force them to strengthen their financial reserves after finding almost a fifth of new mortgage lending has gone to customers who only just meet its affordability rules. High street banks are increasingly selling mortgages at or near the Bank\u2019s restriction for borrowing not to exceed more than 4.5 times a customer\u2019s income. It said no action was required at this stage but that it would monitor the market and would take steps if necessary from as early as June. The development comes as one of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders refused to bow to pressure from the government to build more homes, after suggesting that the limits imposed on borrowers were among factors preventing an increase in housing supply. Berkeley Homes, which is focused on the south-east and London, said it could not justify the step-up in building because of these restrictions. Publishing its latest regular health check of the banking system, the central bank\u2019s financial policy committee said there were \u201csome signs of rising domestic risk appetite in recent quarters\u201d as household debt begins to rise. Although the cost of borrowing remains lower than before the financial crisis, the Bank has begun to raise interest rates, putting increasing pressure on household finances. The Bank revealed that its annual stress test for the major British banks would be almost identical to last year, when it concluded they would all be able to withstand a disorderly Brexit. Barclays, HSBC, RBS, Lloyds, Santander UK, Standard Chartered and Nationwide will be put through their third annual check-up this year, designed to spot warning signs in the banking industry to prevent a rerun of the financial crisis. The results of the test typically come in the final months of the year. The Bank said the 2018 test would include the same catastrophic economic scenario as was set in 2017, which was much tougher than the conditions seen in the financial crisis. The test includes a 4.7% fall in GDP, house prices crashing by as much as a third and interest rates rising to 4%, from 0.5% today. It said it was leaving the test unchanged to gauge the impact of new accounting measures for the banking industry due to come into effect from this year, which will force banks to take provisions against loans that could turn sour more quickly than they are required to do so at present. Threadneedle Street said progress was being made to reduce the risks to the financial system from a disorderly Brexit, although it warned \u201cmaterial risks\u201d still remain, particularly in areas where actions would be needed by both UK and EU authorities. Ahead of a crunch meeting of the EU council summit next week, the central bank said as much as \u00a326tn in derivatives contracts could be at risk without new rules or agreements being drawn up between London and Brussels. However, the Bank said the high street banks could still withstand a disorderly Brexit. The financial policy committee said there were other risks brewing outside Europe for British banks, including in the US from a rapid build-up in corporate debt despite the Federal Reserve raising interest rates \u2013 which typically acts to discourage firms from borrowing. It said financial vulnerabilities in China also remain elevated. Elsewhere, the committee said it would take action to ensure the financial system was protected against any risks arising from bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, had used a recent speech to warn that digital currencies face a regulatory crackdown, saying that they were \u201cinherently risky\u201d and had failed to fulfil their most basic function as money.",

On Friday the drinks retailer, which also operates the wholesaler Matthew Clark, told the City it was considering asking shareholders to inject fresh funds into the business. Investors were receptive to bailing out the company, a well-placed source told the Guardian, with the company looking to raise at least \u00a350m. Shares in the company, run by its chief executive, Diana Hunter, were suspended on Wednesday after two profit warnings in the space of a week wiped more than 60% off its stock market value. The shares were suspended at 101p after a precipitous fall that began last week when it blamed a shock profit warning on an arithmetic error made by a member of its finance team. At that time the retailer said profits would be 20% lower than the \u00a370m expected by the City, with \u00a35.2m of the \u00a314m hole that had opened up in its forecast down to a spreadsheet error, while the remainder was a reflection of weakening profit margins. Conviviality is a major player in the UK drinks industry, with sales of \u00a31.6bn in 2017. It supplies more than 700 off-licences \u2013 a mix of company-run and franchise stores. Its wholesale arm, which includes the Matthew Clark and Bibendum businesses, is the market leader with 23,000 pubs and restaurant customers including the JD Wetherspoon chain. The blow to management credibility dealt by last week\u2019s profit alert was compounded by this week\u2019s admission that it had not budgeted for a \u00a330m tax bill that falls due at the end of March and as a result was in urgent talks with its banks about funding. The tale of woe means Conviviality now has a market value of just \u00a3185.5m compared with \u00a3567.3m before the first unscheduled trading update. It has also cancelled its interim dividend to save \u00a38.2m. In a statement Conviviality said it had asked accountants from PwC to lead a \u201creview of the business and its future finding requirements\u201d and that its customers and suppliers \u201cremain supportive\u201d of the company. It also added: \u201cThe company has engaged with HM Revenues and Customs regarding the \u00a330m payment due on the 29 March 2018. HMRC has been receptive to our needs and these discussions continue.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The north-south divide in house prices is beginning to narrow as the booming London property market fizzles out, according to experts who forecast parts of northern England are set to maintain a recent increase in value. Growth in house prices in the capital is expected to slip below the national average, continuing a slide triggered by the Brexit vote. This will result in further downgrades in parts of the city with the greatest concentrations of luxury flats, the experts said. Meanwhile, major regional cities such as Manchester and Birmingham and their suburbs are expected to grow faster than the rest of the country, albeit rising from a lower level than London. Nitesh Patel, a housing economist at Halifax bank, said: \u201cAffordability issues suggest that price growth will continue to remain low. [But] outside London, there are few signs of significant stresses.\u201d Savills, the estate agency group, forecasts average UK house price growth of 14% over the next five years \u2013 but with London significantly underperforming the rest of the country by growing at roughly half that rate. In sharp contrast, the north-west is projected to see the strongest growth in Britain at about 18%. Rupert des Forges, a partner at the estate agents Knight Frank, said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a generation of people who, unless they\u2019re helped, are really going to struggle to get into London. You\u2019re going to see an almost democratisation of house prices across the country as a result.\u201d The comments came as a survey this week showed that house prices in prime parts of London had tumbled deeply over the past year, with Wandsworth \u2013 which includes much of Clapham, Balham and Putney \u2013 falling nearly 15%. By contrast, the figures from estate agency Your Move showed that the north-west was now the fastest growing market in England and Wales with prices in Blackburn growing 16.4%. Years of rapid growth in London have made the capital increasingly unaffordable, particularly for younger buyers who are forced to rent expensive homes in the city while struggling to save for a deposit. The average home in the capital costs \u00a3484,000, according to the Office for National Statistics, almost double the average for England as a whole of \u00a3244,000. House prices in relation to average earnings in London are at roughly nine times annual average earnings, while in the north-west they are about five times more expensive than average yearly pay. Andrew Montlake of the mortgage broker Coreco, said: \u201cThings started to change, with companies looking at moving to other areas. That has to be positive \u2013 everyone knows there needs to be some kind of rebalancing.\u201d Blackburn house prices surge on back of a \u2018mini-boom\u2019 Susan Wolstenholme has been working as an estate agent in Blackburn, Lancashire, for 20 years. She was there for the 2008 crash in house prices and the subsequent years of stagnation. But towards the end of 2017, she says, things started to change. \u201cSince January we\u2019ve got over asking price on in excess of a dozen houses,\u201d she says sitting in the upstairs office of the branch of Bridgfords that she manages in the town centre. \u201cParticularly on the south side of town, we\u2019re getting at least asking price or above.\u201d That sense was confirmed by this week\u2019s figures from Your Move, which singled out Blackburn as the fastest growing area in England and Wales Unlike the property boom seen in London, the rise in house prices in Blackburn does not appear to stem from a lack of supply. The town has plenty of red-brick terraces, many of which are still empty, says Adrian McCormack, a Blackburn-based mortgage adviser with Countrywide. Wolstenholme says the surge in prices is partly a result of developers building houses that people want to live in. There are currently about 12 new housing developments in the town, with 430 homes expected to be completed this year, 28% of which are classed affordable. \u201cI\u2019ve done this job for 20 years and first-time buyers used to start with a terraced house and now they\u2019re wanting gardens and driveways,\u201d she says. One of those new developments is Green Hills, an estate of 167 homes designed by Wayne Hemingway, co-founder of the fashion label Red Or Dead. The houses are based on the design of traditional Lancashire farmsteads, and the project\u2019s publicity material emphasises the high quality of the materials used and the communal green spaces on the site. Hemingway says he wouldn\u2019t have been able to persuade a developer to agree to the design of the estate in Blackburn six years ago. \u201cHousing design in places like Cambridge, Oxford and Bristol have a flourish about them, which reflects the fact that people are feeling upbeat and confident,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you go to towns that are struggling, the housing is completely identikit and dour. Blackburn is switching now.\u201d Phil Riley, the senior deputy leader at Blackburn and Darwen council, says the success of developments like Green Hills demonstrates that, on balance, \u201cthere are quite a lot of people in Blackburn who are doing OK\u201d. The town\u2019s centre has been transformed over the past five years and Blackburn is on the up, he says. Falling house prices in Putney Mubasher Malik was told two years ago he could fetch \u00a31.5m for the six-bedroom Victorian house in Putney, south-west London, where his family have lived for 30 years. Brexit is worrying some buyers, he says, or maybe the estate agent may have been too optimistic. Either way, he now expects to sell for up to \u00a3300,000 less. \u201cThere\u2019s a reality check everyone needs,\u201d he says. \u201cFalling prices do concern me. But I\u2019m not trying to sell to cash in and move away. It\u2019s about how we can afford the next house.\u201d The IT consultant says his current place needs some work, but it\u2019s still a catch; on a quiet tree-lined street less than five minutes\u2019 walk to the train station connecting Putney with Waterloo. But he wants to downsize after his father died. \u201cI have to compromise to sell \u2013 but the other sellers need to as well. Because no one is budging, it\u2019s very difficult to move,\u201d he says. After almost a decade on the boil, the steam has come hissing out of the capital\u2019s housing market since the EU referendum. This week\u2019s Your Move figures showed house prices in this part of London, in the borough of Wandsworth, have fallen in value by nearly 15% in the past year. The developers of plush towers lining the banks of the Thames in Wandsworth, close to Battersea Power Station, have been particularly caught out, according to John King, the chairman of agents Andrew Scott Robertson in nearby Wimbledon. \u201cThe rest of the year is going to be tough, I don\u2019t see a recovery until 2021,\u201d he says.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A break-up of Britain\u2019s big four accountancy firms could end their dominance in auditing the accounts of large companies and address a crisis of confidence facing the sector after a series of scandals, a UK regulator has suggested. Stephen Haddrill, the chief executive of the Financial Reporting Council, which regulates the sector, called for an investigation into whether KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY should have to spin off their UK audit arms into separate businesses. The aim would be to increase competition and eliminate conflicts of interest arising from the dominance of the four firms. It follows a series of corporate accounting scandals, including UK construction firm Carillion, whose books were signed off by KPMG and which collapsed under a pile of debt in January. Deloitte is under review by regulators in South Africa after the firm flagged irregularities in the accounts of its client, the furniture group Steinhoff, which owns Poundland, Benson for Beds and Harveys in the UK. \u201cThere is a loss of confidence in audit and I think that the industry needs to address that urgently,\u201d Haddrill told the Financial Times. \u201cIn some circles, there is a crisis of confidence.\u201d Haddrill has held discussions with the Competition and Markets Authority about opening an investigation into the UK audit market, and is planning to hold future meetings on the issue. The big four accountants audited all but nine of the companies listed on the FTSE 350 at the end of their financial years, according to Manifest, a research firm that provides investors with information on corporate governance. A previous inquiry into the dominance of the big four by the UK Competition Commission \u2013 now replaced by the CMA \u2013 resulted in tougher rules for the accountancy sector being introduced in 2013. Measures included a requirement that FTSE 350 companies put their audit business out to tender at least every 10 years. However, the market share of the four firms subsequently increased, rather than fell. Haddrill said: \u201cThe Competition Commission introduced some remedies to try and encourage more competition. But there is no more competition. So it seems to me that we ought to have another look at [the audit market].\u201d The CMA told the FT: \u201cWe are actively monitoring the remedies put in place following the Competition Commission\u2019s inquiry \u2026 This monitoring is ongoing and the [authority] remains open to looking further at this sector in the future.\u201d Critics of the big four\u2019s dominance have pointed to potential conflicts of interest arising from the rapid growth of their consulting divisions. They argue that an accountancy firm might have a biased approach to a client\u2019s audit if it also has a lucrative consultancy contract with the company, advising it in areas such as tax. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the senior leadership of the firm, I think you need to be focusing heavily on your public interest responsibility, which is the audit bit,\u201d Haddrill said. \u201c[But] so much of your attention is bound to be drawn to the most profitable and the fastest-growing part of your business, which is not the public interest part.\u201d Audits on Carillion were criticised last month as \u201ca colossal waste of time\u201d by Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP and chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee. Following a BEIS committee evidence session, Reeves suggested the auditors had a role to play in the collapse of the company. She said: \u201cWe heard from auditors who don\u2019t attend audit meetings, fail to visit projects which they themselves say are at risk, and who provide clarity only about what is not included in an audit rather than what is.\u201d",

Deloitte is under review by regulators in South Africa after the firm flagged irregularities in the accounts of its client, the furniture group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/03/poundland-seals-180m-financing-deal-reduce-reliance-steinhoff\">Steinhoff, which owns Poundland, Benson for Beds and Harveys in the UK</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a loss of confidence in audit and I think that the industry needs to address that urgently,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/911e8184-283d-11e8-b27e-cc62a39d57a0\">Haddrill told the Financial Times</a>. \u201cIn some circles, there is a crisis of confidence.\u201d</p> <p>Haddrill has held discussions with the Competition and Markets Authority about opening an investigation into the UK audit market, and is planning to hold future meetings on the issue.</p> <p>The big four accountants audited all but nine of the companies listed on the FTSE 350 at the end of their financial years, according to Manifest, a research firm that provides investors with information on corporate governance.</p> <p>A previous inquiry into the dominance of the big four by the UK Competition Commission \u2013 now replaced by the CMA \u2013 resulted in tougher rules for the accountancy sector being introduced in 2013. Measures included a requirement that FTSE 350 companies put their audit business out to tender at least every 10 years.</p> <p>However, the market share of the four firms subsequently increased, rather than fell.</p> <p> Haddrill said: \u201cThe Competition Commission introduced some remedies to try and encourage more competition. But there is no more competition. So it seems to me that we ought to have another look at [the audit market].\u201d</p> <p>The CMA told the FT: \u201cWe are actively monitoring the remedies put in place following the Competition Commission\u2019s inquiry \u2026 This monitoring is ongoing and the [authority] remains open to looking further at this sector in the future.\u201d </p> <p>Critics of the big four\u2019s dominance have pointed to potential conflicts of interest arising from the rapid growth of their consulting divisions. They argue that an accountancy firm might have a biased approach to a client\u2019s audit if it also has a lucrative consultancy contract with the company, advising it in areas such as tax.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re in the senior leadership of the firm, I think you need to be focusing heavily on your public interest responsibility, which is the audit bit,\u201d Haddrill said. \u201c[But] so much of your attention is bound to be drawn to the most profitable and the fastest-growing part of your business, which is not the public interest part.\u201d </p> <p>Audits on Carillion were criticised last month as \u201ca colossal waste of time\u201d by Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP and chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee.<br></p> <p>Following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/22/mps-attack-pension-regulator-at-carillion-inquiry\">a BEIS committee evidence session</a>, Reeves suggested the auditors had a role to play in the collapse of the company. </p> <p>She said: \u201cWe heard from auditors who don\u2019t attend audit meetings, fail to visit projects which they themselves say are at risk, and who provide clarity only about what is not included in an audit rather than what is.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The magnum bottle, once the preserve of bankers\u2019 bonus celebrations, is entering the mainstream as supermarkets report a surge in sales. Waitrose says purchases of magnums \u2013 twice the size of ordinary wine bottles \u2013 have doubled in the past year, while Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco each point to growth of more than 20%. At Majestic Wine, the UK\u2019s largest specialist wine shop, sales have risen by 500%. Magnums are commonly associated with champagne but the new trend, according to Waitrose, is for non-sparkling wines such as C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne in 1.5 litre bottles. \u201cShoppers are looking for more affordable choices in these wow-factor bottles,\u201d said Anne Jones, category manager of wine, beer and spirits at the supermarket chain. A magnum of soave costs \u00a38 at Tesco, while a malbec costs \u00a315 at Sainsbury\u2019s. This is significantly cheaper than champagne magnums \u2013 such as Mo\u00ebt, Lanson and Bollinger \u2013 where the lowest prices range between \u00a365 and \u00a390. A record \u00a315m in magnum sales was reported in the UK last year, according to Nielsen Research. Although sales are modest within a \u00a36.7bn UK wine market, thetrend drew expressions of concern from one alcohol expert. \u201cIf we get to the stage where there\u2019s a price incentive to purchase them, like there is with boxed wine, then this could become more of a concern,\u201d said Prof Petra Meier, the head of the Alcohol Research Group at the University of Sheffield. Meier said the image of a magnum as a luxury product had put off heavy drinkers historically, but the boom in low-priced 1.5 litre bottles could change that. Meier argues that larger serving sizes tend to lead to \u201cmore and faster consumption\u201d, which would fly against recent trends in the UK where binge drinking has been in decline. Public Health England says 31% of adults drink more than four units on their heaviest day of the week, down from 37% a decade ago. In Australia \u2013 where the magnum has been mainstream for some time \u2013 binge drinking is believed to affect almost half of young adults, though there is no evidence to suggest the larger bottles are fuelling this. Per capita, alcohol consumption in Australia is only marginally higher than in Britain, at 12.6 litres of pure alcohol a year compared with 12, according to the World Health Organization. Exports of magnums from Australia to the UK increased by 130% last year, according to Wine Australia. But there, the magnum craze is driven by the so-called \u201cgoon bag\u201d, box wine, which was invented in the 1960s. The UK version has been rebranded as the \u201cbagnum\u201d and since its launch in 2013, at a cost of between \u00a322 and \u00a330 per bag, sales have doubled each year. \u201cRetailers are cottoning on that it\u2019s not the drinking that\u2019s important, it\u2019s the drinking experience,\u201d said Joe Fattorini, one of the presenters of The Wine Show on Channel 5. \u201cThere\u2019s something very sociable about sharing magnums. It\u2019s a way of bonding.\u201d Fattorini insists the best wines he has ever tasted have been poured from a magnum. \u201cWine matures more slowly in bigger bottles, so it develops more complex aromas and textures, but still keeps that lovely fresh fruit,\u201d he said. Wine bottle sizes Standard (750ml): the common bottle size for most wine \u2013 six 125ml glasses. Magnum (1.5l): equivalent to two standard bottles \u2013 12 glasses. Double magnum (3l): Four standard bottles \u2013 24 glasses. Jeroboam (4.5l): six standard bottles \u2013 36 glasses. Imperial (6l): eight standard bottles or two double magnums \u2013 48 glasses. Salmanazar (9l): 12 standard bottles or a full case of wine \u2013 72 glasses. Balthazar (12l): 16 standard bottles or two imperials \u2013 96 glasses. Nebuchadnezzar (15l): 20 standard bottles \u2013 120 glasses.",
