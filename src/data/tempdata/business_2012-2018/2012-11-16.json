      "bodyText": "Closing down sales will start in around 30 Comet stores on Saturday as administrators prepare the ground for the first wave of redundancies among store staff. Accountants at Deloitte have spent two weeks looking for a buyer for the electricals chain, whose collapse has put 6,600 jobs under threat. They have already cut 330 jobs across its Rickmansworth head office and support centres in Hull and Clevedon, and several hundred job losses are also thought to be imminent at its home delivery arm which spans 12 regional hubs. The locations of the stores that are closing have not been released with staff due to be briefed either Friday night or first thing tomorrow. The initial tranche of store closures equates to more than 10% of embattled Comet's 236 stores. Deloitte declined to comment. With no buyer expected to emerge for the whole business, Maplin, the privately-owned electricals group, is among the rivals chains expected to pick up some stores. Comet's failure came nine months after the company was taken over by investment firm OpCapita, which bought it for a nominal \u00a32 in February. The retailer came with a \u00a350m dowry from its stock exchange listed parent Kesa but the new venture struggled from day one with suppliers unable to secure credit insurance to protect them should it fail. Despite the collapse, OpCapita, which is run by former investment banker Henry Jackson, is still on course to make a multimillion pound profit from the deal.",

They have already cut 330 jobs across its Rickmansworth head office and support centres in Hull and Clevedon, and several hundred job losses are also thought to be imminent at its home delivery arm which spans 12 regional hubs.</p> <p>The locations of the stores that are closing have not been released with staff due to be briefed either Friday night or first thing tomorrow. The initial tranche of store closures equates to more than 10% of embattled Comet's 236 stores. Deloitte declined to comment. With no buyer expected to emerge for the whole business, Maplin, the privately-owned electricals group, is among the rivals chains expected to pick up some stores.</p> <p>Comet's failure came nine months after the company was taken over by investment firm OpCapita, which bought it for a nominal \u00a32 in February. The retailer came with a \u00a350m dowry from its stock exchange listed parent Kesa but the new venture struggled from day one with suppliers unable to secure credit insurance to protect them should it fail. Despite the collapse, OpCapita, which is run by former investment banker Henry Jackson, is still on course to make a multimillion pound profit from the deal.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It has become a retail byword for affordable, functional furniture: plain, cheerful items with a certain Nordic wholesomeness about them that millions of consumers the world over can't seem to resist. But on Friday Ikea became associated with something darker when it admitted that at least some of its cupboards, chairs and other household products were produced by East German prisoners incarcerated for their political beliefs. A roomful of angry former GDR prisoners first watched \u2013 and then started to vent decades worth of anger \u2013 as a squirming Peter Betzel formally apologised for using prison labour in the 1970s and 1980s. \"We regret wholeheartedly that this happened,\" said Betzel, head of Ikea Germany, after an independent report by auditors Ernst and Young confirmed that Ikea managers knew of the practice. \"It is not and never was acceptable to Ikea that it should be selling products made by political prisoners and I would like to express my deepest regret for this to the victims and their families\". The company insists that nothing comparable goes on today. But already questions of compensation are being raised that could cost the company dear, not to mention the reputational damage of being seen to profit from people who were fighting for freedom. Alexander Arnold was one such. He was sent to prison at 22 for \"distributing anti-communist propaganda\" \u2013 handing out flyers containing poems by Bertolt Brecht and Hermann Hesse. He says he still has nightmares about the isolation cell where he was sent if he failed to keep up with the heavy work load. Arnold made parts for office chairs. \"By the end of my 11-month sentence, I knew every part of the process,\" he said. \"From the rollers on the feet to the spine of the chair\". He was also well aware that he and his fellow prisoners were working for a major western European company, none other than the Swedish flat-pack furniture giant, Ikea. \"It was no secret,\" he said. \"Their name was on the boxes which the products were packed into and the prison guards didn't keep it a secret from us. Everyone knew. I am relieved that this is finally coming to light,\" said Arnold, 51. \"I'm glad that Ikea is taking responsibility but I'm sorry it took someone other than Ikea to bring this to light\". Arnold recalled how he and fellow workers had been set productivity targets. \"Each day we worked what amounted to two and a half working days of that of a normal worker on the outside,\" he said. \"If we slipped to below 80% of the target set, that's when they'd throw you in the isolation cell, for 10 days at a time\". The Ernst and Young report said that while Ikea had had a policy of visiting production facilities to control working processes, access to East German suppliers had been restricted. Dieter Ott, 49, a former prisoner from Naunburg who worked on a punch press making parts for Ikea cupboards and doors, asked why Ikea had not questioned why it was not allowed to visit workers. \"Did you not suspect something? And after all, you were working with a country that was separated from Sweden by a hulking great wall. Surely that should have given you reason enough to ask if you should have been working with East German suppliers?\" Anita Gossler, 79, who was sent to Hoheneck prison for her resistance to the regime and who described how her three-month old baby was taken from her, asked Betzel if Ikea could offer assurances that it was no longer using political prisoners in other parts of the world, particularly in China, where considerable quantities of furniture products are made. \"How can you guarantee that in a place like China you really know what's going on in the factories?\" Betzel said the company had had a strict system of checks and balances in place since 2000. \"We now have a very well organised control system with well over 1,000 control checks being carried out every year.\" The company said it had received tipoffs that it had been using forced labour, but had taken insufficient action against the claims. \"We took steps to ensure that prisoners were not used in production, but it's now clear to us that these were not decisive enough,\" Betzel added. Gossler, who as a prisoner made sheets, aprons and table cloths for companies other than Ikea including leading west German clothing and household catalogues, welcomed the company's announcement that it planned to donate funds to research projects on forced labour in the former GDR. \"There were many companies involved in this practice,\" she said. \"And finally they should all be named and shamed. Ikea has put its head above the parapet and admitted its guilt but there are plenty of others who should also be approached for compensation.\"",

Jin Liqun, chair of the supervisory board of the China Investment Corporation (CIC), said that undue harshness risked a backlash which could end with necessary economic reforms being abandoned. Jin, who has previously argued that Europeans should work harder, repeated an earlier warning that governments had spent unsustainably in the past and need to be more fiscally responsible, but added that the depth of public anger could lead to a \"complete discarding\" of austerity programmes. \"The fact the public are taking to the streets and resorting to violence indicates the general public's tolerance has hit its limits,\" he said. \"Unions are now involved in organised protests; demonstrations and strikes. It smacks of the 1930s,\" he said. \"The general public's tolerance of austerity has been stretched to breaking point.\" Speaking to the Guardian, Jin said the key was to balance fiscal cutbacks with growth strategies. \"So there should be some tolerance, but the determination to carry on austerity should not be relaxed.\" Jin's comments came two days after the eurozone saw the biggest anti-austerity protests since the financial crisis began, with riot police clashing with demonstrators in several cities. Christine Lagarde, the IMF managing director, received a taste of the global concern over the eurozone during a trip to the Philippines. Protesters gathered in Manila dressed as zombies, carrying placards bearing slogans including \"IMF is an economic zombie\" and \"IMF is dead. A walking dead\". Plastered with fake blood, the group lay down on the road outside the presidential palace and said they were acting in solidarity with the people of Europe, The euro crisis overshadowed Lagarde's trip - which is already being truncated so she can return to Europe for another meeting of finance ministers next Tuesday. The IMF managing director said it was essential that the eurozone agrees a way to put Greece on a sustainable debt path. \"It is not over until the fat lady sings, as the saying goes,\" Lagarde told a press briefing. \"It is a question of working hard, putting our mind to it, making sure that we focus on the same objective which is that the country in particular.\" Gary Jenkins, analyst at Swordfish Research, predicted that the IMF and the eurozone will agree a deal to give Greece its next slice of funding, after failing to reach agreement last Monday. \"The alternative is to risk a disorderly default and a potential meltdown of the eurozone,\" Jenkins added. The latest trade data showed a drop in goods being brought into the eurozone, a day after it fell into recession. Imports fell 4% in September while exports rose by 1%, resulting in a euro area trade surplus of \u20ac9.8bn (\u00a37.8bn) in September, up from just \u20ac1.7bn a year ago.",

      "body": "<p>After a near 50% slump in value following its much-hyped flotation in May, <strong>Facebook</strong> has recovered some of its poise despite the prospect of a wave of selling by company insiders.</p> <p>On Wednesday, a restriction on Facebook employees and early investors selling around 800m of their shares was lifted, and traders were braced for the company to come under further pressure.</p> <p>In the event Facebook shares jumped 11% on Wednesday and Thursday and added another 5% in early trading yesterday. Tim Ghriskey, investment manager at Solaris Group, told Reuters:</p> <blockquote> While the lockup is expiring there is nothing requiring anyone to sell. Given the low price these long-term holders are deciding to hold the stock, and that is lifting it as the fear of the expiration subsides. </blockquote> <p>It was not such a good week for other investors.</p> <p>In the UK, leading shares fell to their lowest level for more than three and a half months on Friday, after a week of worries about the eurozone and US economies.</p> <p>Greece managed to avoid defaulting on a \u20ac5bn loan payment after raising sufficient funds in a series of bond auctions, but its long term fate depends on the release of \u20ac31.5bn of funding from the EU and IMF, with another meeting due to take place on Tuesday. Meanwhile Spain continued to resist a bailout, and the eurozone officially went into recession as protests against austerity swept across Europe. Investors were also concerned about US spending cuts and tax rises due to come into effect in 2013, with discussions between President Obama and congress to resolve the so-called fiscal cliff likely to drag on.</p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> closed 72.16 points lower at 5605.59, a level not seen since 26 July. The index has now risen just 30 points since the start of the year and is some 6% off the peak of 5965 reached in the middle of March.</p> <p>With investors shying away from risk, mining groups and banks were among the leading fallers. <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> lost 14.8p to 259.6p and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> fell 65.5p to 2934.5p.</p> <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> closed 4.8p lower at 277.4p while <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> lost 1.725p to 43.975p. On Thursday a group of MPs on the public accounts committee said the \u00a366bn of taxpayers money used to buy shares in Lloyds and RBS may never be recovered. In a sell note on Lloyds, Investec analyst Ian Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> We agree with the conclusion that the tax-payer will never get out clean, but why did UKFI [which manages the stakes in nationalised banks] fail to sell a few shares when Lloyds peaked at 78p in 2010, and why not sell a few now, while, in our view, Lloyds trades above fair value? Four months of falling UK house prices and 12 months of falling UK commercial property prices suggest that it may prove wise to reduce positions now. <br> Many Lloyds staff appear to adopt the same philosophy as the Public Accounts Committee when managing their own shareholdings, patiently waiting for the shares to rebound towards the 990p level at which (tax-free) profit-share allocations were distributed to employees over a decade ago. Sadly, we will all be dead before they get there. </blockquote> <p>Even a one time haven such as water company <strong>Pennon</strong> came under pressure. The company warned on profits on Thursday due to a slowdown at its waste business Viridor, and its shares fell another 29p to 599.5p.</p> <p><strong>Melrose</strong>, the industrial group, was the day's biggest faller in the leading index, down 27.1p to 208.9p as it cautioned about the outlook for 2013.</p> <p>But outsourcing group <strong>Serco</strong> added 5.5p to 550p after it said new contract wins should help a revival in revenues after a first half decline. Earlier in the week rival <strong>Capita</strong>, down 4p to 713p, had said it expected a pick-up in UK public sector work ahead of an election.</p> <p>But <strong>G4S</strong>, down 1.9p to 244.1p, continued to suffer from the fiasco surrounding its London Olympics contract, when it failed to provide enough security staff for the games. Mark Hamilton, the managing director of its Olympics contract became the third director to leave the company in the wake of the problems.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Next</strong> dipped 8p to \u00a335.42 despite Credit Suisse beginning coverage of the fashion retailer with an outperform rating and a target price of \u00a342. The bank said Next's ability to add on extra space was slowing, it had a number of other ways to maintain its growth. These included service improvements to its Directory division to attract more customers, increasing the number of credit customers, expanding overseas and building sales of homeware products. It said:</p> <blockquote> Service levels are a key differentiator: The extended late cut-off (from 7pm to 9pm) has been responsible for around 4% growth at Directory over the last eighteen months and Next has a raft of service improvements being rolled out over the next year. We cautiously expect it to deliver an additional 2% growth next year but the impact could be considerably higher. <br> Next has run its credit book very conservatively through the downturn. Although it has started to increase account numbers over the last two years, receivables per account have been flat for the past six years. Given very low bad debt levels and high profitability, we would expect Next to steadily accelerate its credit book into a recovery.  Next has finally found a (very) profitable and scaleable route overseas, again driven by high service levels.  Homeware sales have risen from 10% to 20% of sales over the last decade, despite significant market weakness. Moreover, the middle market has been hollowed out by discounters and mass merchants. Given the high credit attachment rates, we believe Next's Home sales will accelerate over the next two years. </blockquote> <p><strong>SuperGroup</strong>, the company behind the Superdry brand, lost 51.5p to 638.5p after analysts at Numis moved from hold to sell.</p> <p><strong>BP</strong> dropped 8.8p to 416.6p.

      "bodyText": "After a near 50% slump in value following its much-hyped flotation in May, Facebook has recovered some of its poise despite the prospect of a wave of selling by company insiders. On Wednesday, a restriction on Facebook employees and early investors selling around 800m of their shares was lifted, and traders were braced for the company to come under further pressure. In the event Facebook shares jumped 11% on Wednesday and Thursday and added another 5% in early trading yesterday. Tim Ghriskey, investment manager at Solaris Group, told Reuters: While the lockup is expiring there is nothing requiring anyone to sell. Given the low price these long-term holders are deciding to hold the stock, and that is lifting it as the fear of the expiration subsides. It was not such a good week for other investors. In the UK, leading shares fell to their lowest level for more than three and a half months on Friday, after a week of worries about the eurozone and US economies. Greece managed to avoid defaulting on a \u20ac5bn loan payment after raising sufficient funds in a series of bond auctions, but its long term fate depends on the release of \u20ac31.5bn of funding from the EU and IMF, with another meeting due to take place on Tuesday. Meanwhile Spain continued to resist a bailout, and the eurozone officially went into recession as protests against austerity swept across Europe. Investors were also concerned about US spending cuts and tax rises due to come into effect in 2013, with discussions between President Obama and congress to resolve the so-called fiscal cliff likely to drag on. The FTSE 100 closed 72.16 points lower at 5605.59, a level not seen since 26 July. The index has now risen just 30 points since the start of the year and is some 6% off the peak of 5965 reached in the middle of March. With investors shying away from risk, mining groups and banks were among the leading fallers. Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation lost 14.8p to 259.6p and Rio Tinto fell 65.5p to 2934.5p. Royal Bank of Scotland closed 4.8p lower at 277.4p while Lloyds Banking Group lost 1.725p to 43.975p. On Thursday a group of MPs on the public accounts committee said the \u00a366bn of taxpayers money used to buy shares in Lloyds and RBS may never be recovered. In a sell note on Lloyds, Investec analyst Ian Gordon said: We agree with the conclusion that the tax-payer will never get out clean, but why did UKFI [which manages the stakes in nationalised banks] fail to sell a few shares when Lloyds peaked at 78p in 2010, and why not sell a few now, while, in our view, Lloyds trades above fair value? Four months of falling UK house prices and 12 months of falling UK commercial property prices suggest that it may prove wise to reduce positions now. Many Lloyds staff appear to adopt the same philosophy as the Public Accounts Committee when managing their own shareholdings, patiently waiting for the shares to rebound towards the 990p level at which (tax-free) profit-share allocations were distributed to employees over a decade ago. Sadly, we will all be dead before they get there. Even a one time haven such as water company Pennon came under pressure. The company warned on profits on Thursday due to a slowdown at its waste business Viridor, and its shares fell another 29p to 599.5p. Melrose, the industrial group, was the day's biggest faller in the leading index, down 27.1p to 208.9p as it cautioned about the outlook for 2013. But outsourcing group Serco added 5.5p to 550p after it said new contract wins should help a revival in revenues after a first half decline. Earlier in the week rival Capita, down 4p to 713p, had said it expected a pick-up in UK public sector work ahead of an election. But G4S, down 1.9p to 244.1p, continued to suffer from the fiasco surrounding its London Olympics contract, when it failed to provide enough security staff for the games. Mark Hamilton, the managing director of its Olympics contract became the third director to leave the company in the wake of the problems. Elsewhere Next dipped 8p to \u00a335.42 despite Credit Suisse beginning coverage of the fashion retailer with an outperform rating and a target price of \u00a342. The bank said Next's ability to add on extra space was slowing, it had a number of other ways to maintain its growth. These included service improvements to its Directory division to attract more customers, increasing the number of credit customers, expanding overseas and building sales of homeware products. It said: Service levels are a key differentiator: The extended late cut-off (from 7pm to 9pm) has been responsible for around 4% growth at Directory over the last eighteen months and Next has a raft of service improvements being rolled out over the next year. We cautiously expect it to deliver an additional 2% growth next year but the impact could be considerably higher. Next has run its credit book very conservatively through the downturn. Although it has started to increase account numbers over the last two years, receivables per account have been flat for the past six years. Given very low bad debt levels and high profitability, we would expect Next to steadily accelerate its credit book into a recovery. Next has finally found a (very) profitable and scaleable route overseas, again driven by high service levels. Homeware sales have risen from 10% to 20% of sales over the last decade, despite significant market weakness. Moreover, the middle market has been hollowed out by discounters and mass merchants. Given the high credit attachment rates, we believe Next's Home sales will accelerate over the next two years. SuperGroup, the company behind the Superdry brand, lost 51.5p to 638.5p after analysts at Numis moved from hold to sell. BP dropped 8.8p to 416.6p. Barclays issued an underweight recommendation after the oil giant was hit with a $4.5bn fine, the largest in US history, over the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Reports of price fixing in the gas wholesale market pushed energy companies lower, even though they all denied any wrongdoing. Centrica closed 3p lower at 313.5p yesterday while SSE slipped 26p to \u00a313.64. Finally Aim-listed South African miner DiamondCorp jumped 14% to 4p after it agreed a $6m loan with prestigious New York jeweller Tiffany &amp; Co to fund development of its Lace mine. As part of the deal, the Fifth avenue based business - associated with the Audrey Hepburn film Breakfast at Tiffany's - will get first choice to buy diamonds from the mine. DiamondCorp's chief executive Paul Loudon said: Their decision to provide project finance in return for access to a long-term supply agreement is testament to the quality of the Lace diamonds and an expression of confidence in DiamondCorp's development strategy. Analysts at the company's broker SP Angel said: The offtake agreement suggests that diamond buyers are prepared to help fund mine development in order to secure better quality stones on a long term basis. This is great news for DiamondCorp and for jobs in South Africa.",

      "bodyText": "Photos from the protests that gripped Europe on Wednesday On that note, I think we're finished for the day -- a quieter one after the dramas earlier this week (sorry about that - crisis fatigue, maybe) Back on Monday for more of the same. Thanks, and have good weekends all. Protests have been taking place in several European cities today. Here's a selection of photos: Sony Kapoor of the ReDefine think tank provides a pithy curtain-raiser for next week: European stock markets posted another day of hefty falls. Its the usual story of concerns over slow (or no) progress in the eurozone, and the US fiscal cliff. David Madden, IG's market analyst, was in weary mood: It feels like the Greek debt crisis is as old as the Acropolis. Stocks are sinking as we shut up shop for the weekend, as traders take their money off the table ahead of yet another Eurogroup meeting next week. We all know how it going to play out; the talks will go down to the wire, stocks will fall because of the 'what if' factor, but in the end Greece will be given the money and we might see a small bounce. Even when Greece is given the kiss of life next week, another indebted nation will be in the cross hairs, and it may well be Spain. And here's the damage: FTSE 100: down 72 points at 5605, - 1.27% German DAX: down 1.2% French CAC: down 1% Spanish IBEX: down 1.1% Italian FTSE MIB: down 2% Weak US industrial output data has been released this afternoon, partly due to this month's devastating storm US industrial production fell by 0.4% in October, with Hurricane Sandy probably knocking 1% off the total. That has dampened optimism in the financial markets that US politicians were making progress over the fiscal cliff - more here by Nick Fletcher. There's some interesting polling data out in Germany today too (as well as in Italy), which shows that a majority of people would favour a \"grand coalition\" between Angela Merkel's CDU party and the Social Democrats (currently the largest opposition group). This alliance - Red-Black in the colourful jargon of German politics - is the preferred result for 52% of voters, or 72% of Merkel's supporters. The second most popular option among all voters would be a CDU-Green party alliance. There's almost no chance of the status quo continuing - today's junior partners, the Free Democrats, have seen their support tumble. Here's the latest support by party (according to polling group ZDF) CDU - 39% SD: 30% Green: 16% The WSJ has more details Either a Red-Black or a Red-Green coalition could change Berlin's approach to the crisis - Social Democrat head Peer Steinbrueck has criticised Merkel's government for putting too much focus on cuts and tax rises in Europe's weaker economies rather than driving structural reforms and raising the eurozone's competitiveness. And with nearly a year until the vote, it's going to be exciting to watch... The head of Portugal's opposition has added his voice to those calling for an austerity rethink. Antonio Jose Seguro told reporters in Lisbon today that neither the IMF nor the country's government understand the depth of the crisis in Portugal: The country is in a more serious situation than the government and 'troika' realize...There is a consensus in Portuguese society that the austerity recipe has failed. Yesterday's GDP data showed that Portugal shrank by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2012 -- adding to concerns that it is on the same path that Greece trod under its own bailout programme. The man who runs China's huge sovereign wealth fund has warned that Europe's citizens are being pushed to the limit, and urged politicians in the region to heed the growing protests on the streets. Jin Liqun, chair of China Investment Corporation's supervisory board, told a conference in Beijing that the anti-austerity protests show that the Europe's public are close to breaking point. Our correspondent Tania Branigan was there, and reports that Jin said: One commonality is that unions are now involved in organised protests; demonstrations and strikes. It smacks of the solidarity movement witnessed in the 1930s... The general public's tolerance of austerity has been stretched to breaking point. Jin went on to warn that it was a mistake to attempt austerity at at time when economies really need growth, and suggested that a 'proper balance' was needed. Otherwise, he added, the austerity programmes may collapse completely.... Here's Tania's full story. Jin has previously argued that Europeans need to work harder to fight their way out of the crisis \u2013 today's comments suggest that protests (such as Wednesday's mass action) have had an effect around the globe. Over in Italy, an opinion poll has found that two-thirds of people do not want Mario Monti to continue as prime minister after next spring's elections. The survey, conducted by state-owned TV network RAI, found that Monti's approval rating has halved to 36%, from 71% when he named his new technocratic government (a year ago today). Roberto Weber, chairman of SWG, argued that Monti had done well to cling onto this much support, saying: Given the measures taken and the extreme difficulty of the situation, his approval rating is high. Monti has ruled out standing in next year's elections, and played down suggestions that he ought to stay on as unelected leader. But some in the financial markets would prefer an extended Monti premiership. The Economist's Europe Editor has now defended the newspaper against the wrath of the French government (see 8.51am for the background). John Peet insisted that they were simply trying to be helpful by using a bunch of baguettes as sticks of dynamite, and suggesting that Paris wasn't serious about making reforms. Peet told the newspaper 20 Minutes that: The point of this cover and the article is to encourage France...Other countries including Greece and Portugal have conducted many reforms. This is not yet the case in France. Independent economist Shaun Richards has also warned that the situation in France is deteriorating, in this blogpost. He's particularly concerned about the cost of rescuing France's weaker banks, such as Dexia: As she weakens more and more eyes will turn to her ability to support her weakened banking sector.....the bills are beginning to mount. But also she faces a bill from the bailout programmes she is committed too for her Euro area partners who are in trouble. As of the latest numbers up to the end of the second quarter such lending represents some 1.7% of her GDP to this we can add and rising. Lower income and higher debt does not make a happy mix make as Mr. Micawber observed all those years ago. I suspect the Troika would take a dim view of Wilkins Micawber... A jump in exports from Greece and Portugal has helped to increase the eurozone's trade surplus. That's the encouraging (and perhaps surprising) news from today's eurozone trade data. Greece's exports are up by 11% over the first eight months of the year, while imports are down 13%. In Portugal, exports are up 10% and imports down 5%. And overall, the eurozone posted a trade surplus of \u20ac9.8bn in September, up from just \u20ac1.7bn a year ago. That was due to a 1% rise in exports, and a 4% drop in imports, as this table shows: Greek journalist Costas Vaxevanis, who was acquitted two weeks ago after publishing a list of 2,000 potential tax evaders, is to be tried again. The Athens Public Prosecutor's office said the acquittal was faulty and that Vaxevanis must be tried again by a higher misdemeanor court on the same charges (Reuters reports). Vaxevanis's case caused an international outcry (because Greece has shown a remarkable reluctance to investigate the list - which was curiously mislaid for some time). His acquittal was welcomed - but it appears that the authorities want a second chance. One court official told Reuters: The prosecutor believes that the decision in favour of the journalist is legally wrong. Developing... Over in Greece, the government has begun repaying \u20ac5bn bonds that mature today (and which briefly threatened to trigger a default until Athens easily raised enough money to pay them off) [that's via AFP]. A French government minister has just blasted The Economist over its claim today that France is a \"time-bomb\" that could blow up the single currency. In particular, the Economist's use of a picture of seven baguettes as sticks of dynamite (held together by a blue, white and red ribbon) has infuriated Paris. Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg told Europe 1 radio: Honestly, The Economist has never distinguished itself by its sense of even-handedness....It is the Charlie Hebdo of the City. (Charlie Hedbo is the French satirical newspaper which is notorious for publishing cartoons that mocked Prophet Mohammad in September) And last night, prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault claimed that The Economist was \"resorting to excess\" to sell more copies, adding: I can tell you that France is not at all impressed. Here's the offending front page: And inside, The Economist devotes 14 pages to a special report warning that France could be heading towards a huge crisis - with government spending too high, an unreformed labour market, and little political consensus or commitment to change. It also warns: During the election campaign, Mr Hollande barely mentioned the need for business-friendly reform, focusing instead on ending austerity. His Socialist Party remains unmodernised and hostile to capitalism: since he began to warn about France\u2019s competitiveness, his approval rating has plunged. Worse, France is aiming at a moving target. All euro-zone countries are making structural reforms, and mostly faster and more extensively than France is doing ... The IMF recently warned that France risks being left behind by Italy and Spain. More here Protesters dressed as zombies gathered near the Philippines' presidential palace to protest against the International Monetary Fund. The demonstration was organised by members of the Freedom for Debt Coalition, in solidarity with people in the eurozone. They carried placards with slogans such as \"IMF is an economic zombie\" and \"IMF is dead. A walking dead\". Here are a few pictures of the rally, which took place while Christine Lagarde was holding her meetings and a press conference inside the palace. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis and other key events in the global economy. First up.... Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has issued a plea to European leaders to resolve the uncertainty over Greece's next aid payment, worth \u20ac31.5bn. Speaking on a trip to Manila early this morning, Lagarde said the eurozone must hammer out a deal that puts Greece on a sustainable debt path: It is not over until the fat lady sings as the saying goes. adding... It is a question of working hard, putting our mind to it, making sure that we focus on the same objective which is that the country in particular, Greece, can operate on a sustainable basis, can recover, can get back on its feet, can reaccess markets as early as possible. The remarks come four days after Lagarde had a remarkable public falling out with Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the Eurogroup, over whether Greece should be given until 2020 or 2022 to bring its national debt into line. The IMF's position is that eurozone governments should 'bite the bullet' and take haircuts on their Greek loans, rather than just kicking the can further down the road. That, though remains anathema to euro leaders such as Angela Merkel \u2013 so it's still not clear how next Tuesday's crunch meeting will go.... Lagarde also urged politicians to implement policy commitments to help lift the euro zone economy next year -\u2013 timely, now the area is officially in recession. As usual, we'll be tracking all the unfolding developments in the crisis throughout the day....",

      "bodyText": "Jersey \u2013 you're sooo moneysupermarket.com. The island of Jersey is expected to be the new home of Simon Nixon, the multimillionaire founder of the price comparison site, which would allow him to shelter his \u00a3400m fortune from HM Revenue &amp; Customs. A move by Nixon, who owns just under 50% of the company and who \u2013 only two months ago \u2013 cashed in some shares to benefit from entrepreneur's tax relief, is likely to spark fresh concern about tax avoidance by British businesspeople and major multinational firms. Earlier this week, senior executives from Amazon, Starbucks and Google were accused of diverting hundreds of millions of pounds in UK profits to secretive tax havens during a fraught exchange with a committee of MPs. All three repeatedly denied accusations that they were engaged in aggressive tax avoidance, but were met with derision from members of the committee. Nixon's relocation to Jersey is likely to save the 44-year-old, who currently lives in Cheshire, millions of pounds in tax that he pays on dividends from moneysupermarket.com. A spokeswoman for the company, where Nixon is now deputy chairman, confirmed he was considering a move to the island, adding: \"It's purely a personal matter where he chooses to live.\" Nixon launched moneysupermarket.com in 1999 after dropping out of university to work as a financial adviser. It floated on the stock market in 2007, instantly turning him into Britain's richest entrepreneur aged below 40. On Thursday, the company reported revenues in the third quarter up by 11% and profits ahead by 12%, helped by a surge in customers hoping to beat the rise in electricity and gas prices by switching suppliers.

As the public accounts committee criticised the way the Treasury handled the nationalisation of Northern Rock, it also called on the government to ensure taxpayers got value for money from the future sale of stakes in the bailed out banks. The committee urged the government to keep its role as shareholder separate from \"wider policy objectives\" amid calls from some politicians for RBS to be turned into a small business lending bank.

The bank was split into Northern Rock plc, which resumed lending and was sold to Virgin Money at the start of this year, and Northern Rock Asset Management, the \"bad bank\", which remains in public hands. The committee had been investigating the National Audit Office report published in May which warned that taxpayers faced losses of at least \u00a32bn on the continued ownership of the so-called bad bank. With only two bidders for Northern Rock and only one that was really keen to buy \u2013 Virgin Money \u2013 the committee said this did not bode well for any attempts to sell off RBS, of which taxpayers own just over 80%, and Lloyds, in which taxpayers own just under 40%.
