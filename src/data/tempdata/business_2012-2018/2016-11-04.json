      "bodyText": "Google\u2019s controversial advertising sales business in Dublin earned revenues of \u20ac22.6bn (\u00a320.1bn) from Europe, the Middle East and Africa last year but paid just \u20ac47.8m in tax, according to company filings in Ireland. Revenues at Google Ireland Limited rose 23% in 2015, to \u20ac22.6bn, and were equivalent to a third of the search group\u2019s global income. Of this Irish income, more than $7bn (\u00a35.6bn) is thought to have come from transactions with advertisers in the UK. Google has continued to route its sales from British advertisers through Ireland, despite efforts by the former UK chancellor George Osborne to crack down on multinational tech groups that \u201cabused the trust of the British people\u201d. Google Ireland Limited is one half of the search group\u2019s so-called \u201cdouble Irish\u201d tax structure. Although Google reported booming revenues, its taxable profits were only \u20ac341m. This profit figure was small in large part because the company had to meet administrative expenses of \u20ac16.9bn. These expenses are thought to be dominated by royalty fees paid to other Google subsidiaries \u2013 income which eventually makes its way to a business called Google Holdings Ireland, the second company in Google\u2019s \u201cdouble Irish\u201d structure. Almost no information is made public about Google Holdings Ireland, which is an unlimited company. It is registered to the address of a law firm in Dublin, but is thought to pay no tax in Ireland as it is tax-resident in Bermuda. Because it is unlimited, Google Holdings Ireland is not required to file accounts, under Irish company law. However, Bermuda does not charge corporation tax, so the billions of dollars of income Google is able to move into Google Holdings Ireland each year go untaxed. Google has told investors that, at the end of last year, it had amassed an offshore cash pile of $42.9bn. Other US tech companies that have made use of \u201cdouble Irish\u201d tax avoidance structures include Facebook, Microsoft and Apple. Under pressure from world leaders, Ireland agreed two years ago to start phasing out the tax benefits of such structures. However, Irish ministers have awarded generous \u201cgrandfathering rights\u201d which ensure Google and others are able to pour income into their offshore tax havens up until 2020. Google, which is ultimately owned by the holding company Alphabet Inc, insists it\u2019s business in Ireland are much more than a tax structure. At the end of last year, Google Ireland Limited employed 2,763 staff, an increase of 6% in 12 months. \u201cAs Google grows, Ireland continues to benefit,\u201d said Ronan Harris, who is shortly moving from Ireland to lead Google operations in the UK. \u201cIn 2015 we opened our second data centre, bringing total investment in capital assets in Ireland to over \u20ac750m.\u201d Ahead of the UK election in 2015, George Osborne promised to stop tech firms routing sales from customers in Britain to gateway jurisdictions, such as Ireland or Luxembourg, from where income can then be easily transferred to offshore tax havens. As UK chancellor, Osborne introduced a new punitive tax, known as the diverted profits tax, which he said would hit companies found to be artificially shifting UK income overseas. It later emerged, however, that while some companies, such as Amazon and Facebook, said they would change their ways, others \u2013 including Google and eBay \u2013 have continued to book UK sales overseas. In January, UK tax inspectors reached a \u00a3130m tax settlement with Google over taxes stretching back 10 years. Osborne initially heralded as a \u201cmajor success\u201d, though many others condemned it as too lenient. Separately, Google has promised significant investment in the UK, which some tax campaigners fear may have been a factor in the minds of those at HMRC reaching the settlement. A more serious challenge to the \u201cdouble Irish\u201d tax avoidance method \u2013 or at least the most significant instance of it \u2013 came from European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager. In August she ruled that Apple\u2019s long-standing tax arrangements in Ireland relied on illegal state aid. As a result, the Irish government would have to collect \u20ac13bn in back taxes from the iPhone maker, she said.",

      "bodyText": "The government has blocked an attempt to have unpaid internships banned, but is to investigate the practice as part of the current review of modern working practices. Draft legislation put forward by Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke was designed to ensure that anyone working as an intern would be paid the minimum wage, which depends on the age of the worker. Speaking in parliament he described internships as \u201cthe acceptable face of unpaid labour in modern Britain today\u201d. He added, they \u201cshould have no place in a meritocratic country that aims to work for the many and not the privileged few\u201d. He added that his bill was designed to end \u201ca new rise in the class society that means only those from a wealthy background can gain a privileged leg-up\u201d. However, the bill was talked out by Conservative colleagues. Instead, the business minister, Margot James, said that the government would ask Matthew Taylor to include unpaid internships in his review of employment practices. The former adviser to Tony Blair is investigating the impact of the UK\u2019s growing gig economy on workers\u2019 rights. Speaking about Shelbrooke\u2019s bill, James told MPs: \u201cWhile it\u2019s extremely well-intentioned, I do have concerns that it could have unintended consequences that might even undermine existing employment laws and protections,\u201d she told MPs. She added that if interns met the legal definition of workers in employment law, they were already entitled to the minimum wage. A ban on the use of unpaid internships was recommended two years ago by the government\u2019s social mobility tsar, Alan Milburn, but firms have continued to be able to advertise positions that do not offer a wage. The campaign group Intern Aware said two-thirds of businesses backed a four-week limit on unpaid placements, and just 12% opposed such a cap. Ben Lyons, Intern Aware co-director, said: \u201cIt is positive that the review is going to be looking at this as it is a major issue, which is reducing social mobility and pricing young people out of professions. However, it is disappointing that the government talked out the bill.\u201d Lyons said Shelbrooke\u2019s bill had been \u201ca real opportunity\u201d for the government to back up Theresa May\u2019s pledges to make progress on social mobility. He added: \u201cThere\u2019s a sizeable minority of internships which are unpaid \u2013 we are surprised that more action hasn\u2019t been taken.\u201d Internships are controversial because they are perceived as biased towards the children of well-off professional parents who live in London. They are able to tap into their parents\u2019 contacts to get valuable work experience and can also afford to take unpaid roles. In her speech to the Tory party conference last month, the prime minister said she intended to tackle unfairness and ensure \u201cordinary working-class people\u201d had \u201caccess to the opportunities that are too often the preserve of the privileged few\u201d. Shelbrooke highlighted how some MPs were using unpaid placements. \u201cA quick scan of the [w4mp] website shows roughly 22 MPs advertising for unpaid interns outside of the politics and parliamentary study scheme,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sends a message to businesses across the United Kingdom that exploiting \u2026 young workers is acceptable.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government is committed to building an economy that works for all, not just the privileged few.

    "webTitle": "Sterling soars on Trump jitters and Brexit hopes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Speculation that the UK could avoid a hard Brexit from the European Union, and fears that Donald Trump might snatch a last-minute victory in the race for the White House, have helped sterling register its biggest weekly gain against the US dollar in seven years. The pound\u2019s respite from its recent heavy falls on the foreign exchanges continued on Friday when it put on a cent against the US currency to trade at $1.2558 \u2013 its highest level for four weeks. Sterling\u2019s rally came despite labour market data from the US, which strengthened Wall Street\u2019s belief that official borrowing costs in the world\u2019s biggest economy will be raised before Christmas. Currency dealers paid less interest than usual to the 161,000 increase in non-farm employment last month and the 0.4% increase in hourly earnings, focusing instead on the knife-edge battle between Hillary Clinton and Trump for the presidency. The pound has been rising since the start of the week after evidence of a narrowing of Clinton\u2019s opinion-poll lead and amid evidence from forward-looking business surveys that the UK economy was set to grow robustly in the fourth quarter of 2016. Sterling then received a double-boost on Thursday when the high court ruled that the government could not trigger article 50 to leave the EU without the approval of parliament, and the Bank of England announced that it had abandoned plans for a second post-referendum stimulus. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a bit of a relief rally now that the worst-case scenario of a unilateral hard Brexit has been deferred, and markets can start focusing on other factors (like) the US presidential election,\u201d said CMC analyst Michael Hewson. Investors believe turbulent market conditions will continue, with a government appeal against the high court ruling scheduled for next month, and some analysts weighing up the chances that Theresa May will call an early election to push ahead with Brexit. \u201cJust as markets were looking forward to getting the US election out of the way, this week has seen speculation that another UK election could be right around the corner,\u201d said Paul Hollingsworth, chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. The pound ended the week almost 3% higher against the dollar - its strongest performance since October 2009 \u2013 but remained 16% lower than it was before the Brexit referendum in late June. Sterling\u2019s depreciation has been helpful for the City\u2019s main stock market yardstick \u2013 the FTSE 100 \u2013 since many of the companies included in the index have dollar earnings which are flattered by a drop in the pound. This week\u2019s rise in sterling was accompanied by the biggest drop in the FTSE 100 since January. A fall of 97 points on Friday to 6,693 points brought the cumulative loss over the week to 301 points \u2013 a 4.3% decline. The FTSE 250, which includes more domestically focused companies, posted a smaller 1.8% weekly fall. The last set of US labour market figures before Tuesday\u2019s election showed a slightly smaller increase in non-farm payrolls than the 175,000 rise Wall Street had been expecting. But analysts said the improvement was solid enough to persuade the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, to raise interest rates at its next meeting in December. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revised up jobs growth for August and September by a combined 44,000 and said annual wages growth had edged up from 2.7% to 2.8% \u2013 a seven-year high. \u201cIt seems that the only remaining obstacle to the Fed hiking in December would be a significant adverse financial market reaction to the US presidential election,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at the consultancy IHS Markit. Squabbling between Saudi Arabia and Iran has sent the oil price down, as tension between the near neighbours threatened to derail talks aimed at cutting production by the Opec group of oil-producing countries. Riyadh is reportedly threatening to turn the screw on Tehran before this month\u2019s crucial Opec meeting by increasing its own output to push prices even lower. Saudi Arabia produces up to 10.7m barrels per day (bpd) at the moment, but Opec sources said it had threatened to open the taps much further. \u201cThe Saudis have threatened to raise their production to 11m bpd and even 12m bpd, bringing oil prices down, and to withdraw from the meeting,\u201d one Opec source told Reuters. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude dropped to $45.02 before recovering to $45.42, down 2%, after Opec\u2019s secretary general, Mohammed Barkindo, denied Saudi Arabia had made any threats.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Rail looks set to be granted a further, uncontested 12-month contract to run west coast intercity trains, after the government confirmed that the next winner of the franchise would also operate the first high-speed HS2 trains. A new delay in the Department for Transport\u2019s franchising schedule has left the door open for Branson to keep the service for another year. Branson has taken an average \u00a317m in annual dividends from Intercity West Coast, the London to Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow service, over the last three years. The proposed West Coast Partnership franchise, announced on Friday by the DfT, will start no longer start in 2018 but rather in April 2019. The winner will run mainline trains from 2019 and be involved in the design and launch of high-speed services, before running HS2\u2019s trains between London and Birmingham for three to five years from 2026. The DfT said the joint franchise would attract \u201ca world-class bidding group to develop and enhance the service\u201d. Unions and Labour criticised the plan. Transport minister Andrew Jones said: \u201cWe are embarking on a new chapter in our modernisation of the railways and we need world-class expertise to deliver it. HS2 will be the backbone of Britain\u2019s railways, creating more seats for passengers on the west coast and increasing capacity on the rest of the network. \u201cBy combining the franchise we are ensuring we get the right people on board at an early stage to design and manage the running of both services in the transition stage.\u201d In the first phase of HS2, trains will travel on new high-speed tracks between London and Birmingham and continue north from the West Midlands on the existing west coast mainline. Sir David Higgins, chairman of HS2 Ltd, said: \u201cThis is a real opportunity to ensure HS2 services complement and enhance existing ones. I have always been clear HS2 will not be a standalone railway but fully integrated with the wider network.\u201d The government is expecting the winning bidder to work with HS2 Ltd in the design and launch of the high-speed train services. The opportunity to be the first operator of HS2 trains could be seen as an incentive to run a franchise which will be beset by disruption as the infrastructure is developed before 2026 \u2013 particularly in and out of London Euston, where the platforms will be rebuilt. But analysts warned that committing to operate the new network would also carry substantial risk. The west coast timetable will be radically redrawn after HS2, which will provide faster intercity trains and free up more paths for commuter services on existing tracks. Labour said that it would bring back the franchise into public ownership as soon as possible in government. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cIf we are going to invest billions of taxpayers\u2019 money into HS2 it is right that the revenues go back to the exchequer and not straight into the hands of subsidy-dependent train operating companies.\u201d Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers\u2019 union Aslef, said that while the introduction of high-speed services was welcome, he \u201cdeplored ... this government\u2019s continued obsession with the failed franchise model, which is selling commuters and businesses short, and the idea that the way forward is to allow a few people to make a private profit at public expense\u201d. Christian Wolmar, the rail historian, said he doubted the planned, combined franchise could provide value for taxpayers. He warned: \u201cFranchising is an unsuitable policy because of the way that railways change and transform, so predicting the passenger numbers for the future is a mug\u2019s game. \u201cI don\u2019t think that risk can be taken by the private sector without massive compensation. We will end up paying for a risk that cannot be transferred. It\u2019s a crazy approach to running a rail service.\u201d Just four years ago, Virgin took legal action to wrest back the lucrative west coast franchise after being outbid on the rights by rivals First Group. However, the DfT has since made a succession of direct awards, allowing Virgin to operate the franchise without competition until 2018. According to accounts from Stagecoach, Branson\u2019s 49% partner in Virgin Rail, net payments to the government from the west coast franchise over the last three years have totalled \u00a3375m, with dividends to the shareholders totalling \u00a3101m. A detailed invitation to tender for the new franchise will be published in late 2017, with the winning bidder named the following year.",

      "bodyText": "Squabbling between Saudi Arabia and Iran has sent the oil price down, as tension between the near neighbours threatened to derail talks aimed at cutting production by the Opec group of oil-producing countries. Riyadh is reportedly threatening to turn the screw on Tehran before this month\u2019s crunch Opec meeting by increasing its own output to push prices even lower. Saudi Arabia produces up to 10.7m barrels per day (bpd), but Opec sources said it had threatened to open the taps much further. \u201cThe Saudis have threatened to raise their production to 11m bpd and even 12m bpd, bringing oil prices down, and to withdraw from the meeting,\u201d one Opec source told Reuters. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude dropped to $45.02 before recovering to $45.42, down 2%, after Opec\u2019s secretary general, Mohammed Barkindo, denied Saudi Arabia had made any threats. Reports of a row come with Opec countries due to meet on 30 November to discuss curbing supply to boost prices, as they wrestle with a global oil glut. They met at Opec\u2019s Vienna headquarters last month to finalise the terms of an output cut from 34m bpd to as low as 32.5m bpd, but failed to agree quotas for each country. \u201cThere\u2019s a gang of four or five who don\u2019t want any cuts at all, for all sorts of reasons. They [Saudi Arabia] are trying to whip the others into line and I think Iran will come into line,\u201d said Malcolm Graham-Wood of advisory firm Hydrocarbon Capital. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of how they decide to word it so that everyone comes out looking politically sensible. There\u2019s a lot of saving of face within Opec so that people don\u2019t look stupid.\u201d Saudi Arabia, which has previously flooded the markets with cheap crude in a failed attempt to kill off the US shale gas boom, can afford to play chicken with Iran over prices. This is because Iran\u2019s cost of production is higher, meaning it earns less per barrel, and it is still ramping up output after economic sanctions against it were lifted this year. But Graham-Wood said Riyadh might simply be flexing its muscles as a negotiating tactic, pointing out that plans to list state oil company Saudi Aramco on the stock market next year mean it has more reason to protect oil prices. \u201cThe last thing the Saudis want if they\u2019re going to float Saudi Aramco is to have a bad oil market next year. So to save face, I think they won\u2019t say publicly they\u2019ll cut production but if they need the oil price up, they\u2019ll agree with the Iranians that they both take some production off,\u201d he said. Al Stanton, oil analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the uncertainty around Opec has left oil explorers and producers sitting on their hands. \u201cThe oil companies are likely to hold fire with their budgets until they\u2019ve seen what happens,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is expected to announce the closure of up to 30 stores next week as part of an attempt to revive the British retailer. Smaller outlets in flagging towns and shopping centres are likely to form the bulk of the closures, and other stores could be relocated or downsized over several years, potentially leading to thousands of job losses. Shopfloor space is expected to be reallocated, as the Guardian first reported earlier this year, meaning bigger food halls and smaller clothing areas. Unwanted floorspace could be given over to other businesses including retailers and restaurants. Sources told Sky News, which first reported the closures, that they would number \u201cin the low dozens\u201d. Like others on the high street, M&amp;S is struggling to adapt to changing shopping habits. As more people make purchases online, smaller or less attractive town centres and shopping centres are losing out. Clothing retailers have had a difficult year of unseasonal weather, while shoppers have been spending more on eating out, holidays and technology, and less on fashion. The M&amp;S chief executive, Steve Rowe, is expected to announce the store cuts as part of a wide strategic rethink. He is also expected to close stores in China, where M&amp;S has found trading tough, and signal further shutdowns in continental Europe. Rowe is expected to focus instead on expanding M&amp;S\u2019s successful food business, which plans to add 200 small shops by 2019. The latest move comes after M&amp;S announced plans to cut 525 London head office jobs as part of Rowe\u2019s attempts to reduce costs and simplify the business. He is attempting to turn around M&amp;S after the biggest fall in its clothing sales since the 2008 financial crisis. Last year M&amp;S closed a net five \u201cdiscount\u201d stores and one high street outlet in the UK, but increased total trading space slightly by opening dozens of franchised Simply Food stores. The group closed 13 stores in Europe last year. M&amp;S has about 300 full-range stores, 640 food-only outlets, 131 of which are larger food halls, and more than 400 stores overseas. Tony Shiret, an analyst at Haitong, said M&amp;S probably needed to close more than 30 stores, given the changing nature of shopping and years of poor performance by the retailer\u2019s clothing ranges. \u201cThere are a lot of traditional high street shops that have not had a lot of money spent on them for a long time,\u201d he said, suggesting that M&amp;S should shut 20% of its space, as many as 60 stores. But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy to close that amount of space and when you do, it puts pressures on your supply chain.\u201d",

The move comes after lobbying from the National Housing Federation and and other groups such as Positive Money, and Theresa May\u2019s criticism of the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme and its \u201cbad side-effects\u201d for poorer people. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, had said companies will have to show they make a \u201cmaterial contribution to the UK economy\u201d to qualify for the corporate bond programme. There was some surprise, however, when the list of bonds included foreign-owned corporations with limited UK operations, such as Apple, rather than businesses that bolster the UK\u2019s infrastructure. Buying the bonds of housing associations could make borrowing cheaper, reducing interest payments and increasing the amount of money available to invest in housing. However, housing experts questioned whether investors such as pension funds would want to buy those bonds, as other bonds currently offer better returns. Peabody, one of the UK\u2019s oldest housing associations, said it was delighted by the Bank\u2019s move, and that as a result its cost of borrowing had fallen by eight basis points. Peabody owns assets worth \u00a33bn and plans to build 8,000 homes. It is leading a \u00a31.5bn regeneration project in Thamesmead, south-east London, which is expected to deliver up to 20,000 homes. It includes the revamp of a 1970s housing estate that served as the backdrop to A Clockwork Orange. Susan Hickey, Peabody\u2019s chief finance officer, said: \u201cThis is a historic achievement for the sector, demonstrating real confidence in our ability, in our financial strength and capacity to help tackle the housing crisis. This should make it cheaper to borrow and make it easier for us to invest and attract investment in new homes, communities and infrastructure. It is great news.\u201d The editor of Social Housing magazine, Luke Cross, said: \u201cThis obviously could accelerate housing and regeneration schemes, like Peabody\u2019s in Thamesmead.\u201d But he added a note of caution: \u201cOne question is whether investors like pension funds will want to sell these bonds. They still need to find somewhere safe to invest people\u2019s pensions, and many of the bonds they have at the moment offer better returns than they could get in the market today.\u201d The amount of bonds bought by the Bank of England will depend on the size of housing associations\u2019 issuance.

This week I thought I was going to meet the pub trade\u2019s real life Al Murray, for the parallels between Tim Martin\u2019s public image and the fictional Eurosceptic landlord appear disconcertingly close. In fact, on the train to JD Wetherspoon HQ in Watford I opened the Guardian to find a quiz inviting readers to guess which quotes to attribute to each publican. When I run the quiz past Martin later, even he gets two answers wrong. The founder of Wetherspoon\u2019s first entered the debate about Europe in 2002, when he distributed 500,000 beer mats across his pub chain, urging Britain not to join the euro. Before this year\u2019s referendum he printed up another half a million mats, encouraging his customers to back Brexit. One of Vote Leave\u2019s few high-profile businessmen, the multi-millionaire was back in the headlines this week, attacking EU leaders for \u201chectoring\u201d the UK. If Jean-Claude Juncker doesn\u2019t stop \u201cbullying\u201d us, he warned, Wetherspoon pubs might stop stocking European wines and lagers and buy its drinks elsewhere. \u201cBritons could BOYCOTT European booze if Juncker punishes UK, warns Wetherspoons boss,\u201d whooped a Daily Express headline. But Martin\u2019s vision of Brexit turns out to be very different to that of others on his side. During the referendum campaign, a diversity of reasons for leaving was one of the leave side\u2019s great strengths; amid the chorus of different arguments there was something for almost everyone. Now that they have won, however, their incompatibility is becoming overwhelmingly clear. In many respects, Martin\u2019s view of Europe is as unlike Nigel Farage\u2019s \u2013 or Al Murray\u2019s \u2013 as mine. We meet in his office, an unostentatious room cluttered with boxes of Mo\u00ebt champagne, which he gives to office staff when it\u2019s their birthday. At 6ft 6in, well built and ruddy-faced, he looks more like a farmer than a multi-millionaire chairman, and now that he has tamed his silver mullet into a more conventional haircut, the most striking thing about him is his voice. Martin grew up in Northern Ireland and New Zealand, and the accent meanders between the two, via the West Country, interrupted by endless eruptions of booming laughter. I can\u2019t remember meeting anyone who laughs so much, so I ask if he is enjoying his role as a political campaigner. \u201cWell, it\u2019s quite weird, actually,\u201d he admits, \u201cbecause it was unplanned.\u201d In 2002, in the wake of the ERM debacle and with the prospect of Britain joining the euro, Martin made the \u201cbanal observation\u201d that \u201cevery other currency in the world has got a government. The euro can\u2019t work without a government. I kept waiting for a Harvard professor to come out of the woodwork and say, \u2018I\u2019ve never heard such ignorance in my life.\u2019 But they never did. So I just kept repeating it. I became someone on the national news, repeating the same phrase.\u201d He breaks into a cackle. \u201cAnd in the end, the point was true.\u201d Once Britain opted not to join the euro, Martin lost interest in Europe. \u201cI never said a word.\u201d Had we met even just a couple of years ago, would he even have described himself as fiercely Eurosceptic? \u201cNot in the way that a lot of fiercely Eurosceptic people were. I think I was probably just starting to become aware of the lack of democracy at the heart of the EU, and formed the amateur philosophical theory that for the future of humanity \u2013 for prosperity and peace \u2013 you must have democracy. Because if you don\u2019t have democracy,\u201d and he starts to laugh again, \u201cyou always end up with a nutter in charge.\u201d (Does the same apply to businesses? \u201cYes! Even more so, only the customers are the electorate.\u201d) Martin wouldn\u2019t even have been too unhappy for us to remain in the EU. \u201cI just agreed with David Cameron that it needed fundamental reform.\u201d The 61-year-old is of the firm, if increasingly heretical, opinion that Britain has benefited enormously from EU migration, \u201cnot just economically but socially and culturally\u201d. His preferred Brexit model would continue to allow anyone from current EU member states to live and work here. \u201cIf you look around the world, successful economies and countries have had gradually rising populations, and that\u2019s needed for the UK as well.\u201d The only change he would make to the free movement of labour would be to exclude countries who join the EU in the future. How, then, did he feel when the leave campaign focused so heavily on immigration? He exhales uneasily, ums and ahs, and says: \u201cWell, you\u2019ll always get an element of xenophobia in any society, but I don\u2019t think Britain is generally xenophobic. There was one poster I didn\u2019t think should have been put there. But for me, I argued from the point of democracy.\u201d Martin doesn\u2019t even share most Brexiteers\u2019 fury at the high court ruling requiring parliament\u2019s consent to trigger article 50. \u201cWell, it creates a bit more uncertainty,\u201d he offers, \u201cso I can\u2019t exactly welcome it. But I\u2019ll support the legal outcome, because I believe in the law, and I believe in parliament, and I believe in democracy.\u201d The democratic deficit is Martin\u2019s sole objection to the EU project. \u201cThe thing I cannot understand is that when I said I think democracy is crucial for the future of the world, I\u2019d have thought people would pour out of the doors saying, \u2018Yes! Tim is right!\u2019 But people on the remain side just don\u2019t seem to think like that. The emotion of people who\u2019ve been to good universities, et cetera, is not that they owe everything to democracy, but that they owe everything to people like them, who are better able to run companies, the civil service, universities, societies in general.\u201d The phrase \u201cbetter able to run companies\u201d catches my attention. Martin studied law at university, and qualified as a barrister, but then at 24 bought a pub in north London. There was more than a touch of the maverick, plucky little guy about his business model as he expanded: when brewers refused to sell him their tied-lease pubs, he bought up old banks and shops, licensed the converted premises and set about selling affordable food and drink to the unfashionable masses. Famously scruffy, he drives an old Volvo \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t own a yacht\u201d \u2013 and is pointedly unimpressed by the pretensions of professional boardroom culture. It makes me wonder if his Euroscepticism is really another expression of his emotional rebellion against the blue-chip elite. \u201cNo. I know what you\u2019re driving at, but no.\u201d It\u2019s the remainers, he claims, who are motivated by emotion. \u201cSomeone from the Financial Times said I was a great amateur philosopher, which is an insult \u2013 and also probably true.\u201d He hoots with laughter. \u201cAnd I think modern people think because they don\u2019t go to church they\u2019re more sophisticated and don\u2019t have a religion. But I think what the EU became was a quasi-religion for that sector of society. And universities are the modern day seminaries.\u201d Although happy to be a philosopher, he is emphatically not a politician. The last time he voted in a general election was 1992; \u201cI\u2019m not proud of that fact. I just didn\u2019t feel strongly enough.\u201d The only other time he has ever voted was in the 80s, for Margaret Thatcher, because she was his local MP. He mispronounces Andrea Leadsom and Gisela Stuart\u2019s names, and until recently Nigel Farage was the only Ukip politician he had even heard of. Were he American, he would vote for Hillary Clinton, and thinks Donald Trump is a \u201ccomplete egocentric weirdo\u201d, but adds that \u201cI trust the American people to look into it in a bit more detail than me,\u201d so will defer to their judgment next week. \u201cI would never want to be a politician. I know my limitations, and I\u2019m sure politics is more difficult than it looks.\u201d Martin\u2019s indignation this week about EU leaders\u2019 hostility towards Britain did seem politically naive. How else did he imagine they would feel about us for leaving? \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t really know. It was impossible to know how they would react.\u201d He was very cross with Juncker for telling EU business leaders to be \u201cintransigent\u201d in their dealings with British companies. \u201cAnd after telling them to make sure the UK pays a price, he has to expect people from the UK who are fighting from the opposite economic position to make the opposite case!\u201d Well, yes, quite. This outbreak of hostilities was precisely what the remainers had warned of. But leavers will be disappointed by his response when I ask about his boycott. \u201cOh dear!\u201d he laughs, burying his head in his hands. \u201cI can see I\u2019m in trouble here already! I haven\u2019t got a boycott. Absolutely not. I was just attempting to show that if European companies do what Juncker says and try to get heavy with us, inevitably we\u2019d go elsewhere.\u201d I don\u2019t know what \u201cget heavy\u201d means. \u201cWell, no one does!\u201d he hoots. Martin has said the UK doesn\u2019t need to sign a trade deal with the EU, because his pubs don\u2019t sign deals with suppliers. He can\u2019t think running the country is like running a pub, can he? \u201cWhat I was saying is that you can\u2019t go into negotiations with the EU insisting upon a particular outcome. If you say your pre-condition is that we have to have free trade, then in order to get that you have to accept what comes with that.\u201d I suggest that I\u2019ll be the EU, and he can be the UK, and he can show me how he would approach the negotiations. \u201cOK, I would say: Decca, I think free trade will suit both our territories better.\u201d I\u2019ll say: fine, but in that case you have to accept free movement of labour. \u201cI\u2019ll say: look, politically, we can\u2019t.\u201d But this is non-negotiable, I\u2019ll say. \u201cThen I think that we have to, er \u2013 well, it\u2019s up to you then, Decca, what you want to do. We\u2019d like to trade with you. You want to trade with us. So what basis would you like to trade on? That\u2019s what I would say.\u201d I\u2019m not sure this would resolve the impasse. Martin is banking on the EU\u2019s aversion to tariffs to overcome its impulse to impose terms that deter other members from leaving \u2013 and he may be right. But this is a businessman\u2019s assumption; to EU leaders, their political project\u2019s survival may turn out to matter more. We move on to much firmer ground when we abandon Europe and talk about the pub trade. To its admirers, Wetherspoon\u2019s is the saviour of the industry \u2013 while nearly 30 pubs go out of business every week, Martin\u2019s chain keeps on growing. With nearly 1,000 pubs, it turns over \u00a31.5bn a year, employs 35,000 staff, and makes Martin, who owns between a quarter and a third of its shares, worth roughly \u00a3250m. But a sign on his office wall reads \u201cOnly the paranoid survive\u201d \u2013 \u201cand I think there\u2019s a lot of truth in that\u201d, he says. Critics accuse the chain of corporate blandness, and he concedes that \u201cthere are instances where the design hasn\u2019t been good enough, and it has given too much of an impression of impersonality or airport lounge. Pubs need individuality.\u201d He spends three days a week visiting his pubs all over the country, and constantly worries about their future. \u201cYou lose a lot without pubs. They\u2019re an important part of the social and cultural life of the country.\u201d But whereas pubs must charge 20% VAT, supermarkets pay \u201cvirtually no VAT on food sales\u201d, allowing them to subsidise drinks prices. \u201cBut most of the big companies say nothing about it. Because the people running them are taking too short-term an approach; they\u2019re there for five years, they\u2019re not looking 10 or 20 years down the line,\u201d Martin says. He worries about millennials binge-drinking cheap supermarket spirits at home, instead of learning \u201csocial drinking\u201d in pubs, which have \u201cmore or less become ghettos now for adults. Some sort of system that allowed 16-year-olds to have a beer or two in a pub would be good.\u201d Martin might not share all of Al Murray\u2019s views about Europe, but he is a big fan. He\u2019s sure it was Murray who assured an anxious post-referendum public: \u201cCrisps will remain at the current price,\u201d and named as his most extravagant possession: \u201cMy wife, and even she\u2019s a bit mean.\u201d In both instances, it was actually him \u2013 which, of course, only makes him laugh again. \u201cShould have got the crisps right.\u201d",

If you say your pre-condition is that we have to have free trade, then in order to get that you have to accept what comes with that.\u201d I suggest that I\u2019ll be the EU, and he can be the UK, and he can show me how he would approach the negotiations.</p> <p>\u201cOK, I would say: Decca, I think free trade will suit both our territories better.\u201d I\u2019ll say: fine, but in that case you have to accept free movement of labour. \u201cI\u2019ll say: look, politically, we can\u2019t.\u201d But this is non-negotiable, I\u2019ll say. \u201cThen I think that we have to, er \u2013 well, it\u2019s up to you then, Decca, what you want to do. We\u2019d like to trade with you. You want to trade with us. So what basis would you like to trade on? That\u2019s what I would say.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure this would resolve the impasse. Martin is banking on the EU\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/24/eu-firms-higher-tariffs-export-to-uk-than-vice-versa-civitas\">aversion to tariffs</a> to overcome its impulse to impose terms that deter other members from leaving \u2013 and he may be right. But this is a businessman\u2019s assumption; to EU leaders, their political project\u2019s survival may turn out to matter more.</p> <p>We move on to much firmer ground when we abandon Europe and talk about the pub trade. To its admirers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jdwetherspoon\">Wetherspoon\u2019s</a> is the saviour of the industry \u2013 while nearly 30 pubs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/13/the-death-and-life-of-a-great-british-pub\">go out of business every week</a>, Martin\u2019s chain keeps on growing. With nearly 1,000 pubs, it turns over \u00a31.5bn a year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/12/jd-wetherspoon-sports-direct-zero-hours-contracts\">employs 35,000 staff</a>, and makes Martin, who owns between a quarter and a third of its shares, worth roughly \u00a3250m. But a sign on his office wall reads \u201cOnly the paranoid survive\u201d \u2013 \u201cand I think there\u2019s a lot of truth in that\u201d, he says.</p> <p>Critics accuse the chain of corporate blandness, and he concedes that \u201cthere are instances where the design hasn\u2019t been good enough, and it has given too much of an impression of impersonality or airport lounge. Pubs need individuality.\u201d He spends three days a week visiting his pubs all over the country, and constantly worries about their future. \u201cYou lose a lot without pubs. They\u2019re an important part of the social and cultural life of the country.\u201d But whereas pubs must charge 20% VAT, supermarkets pay \u201cvirtually no VAT on food sales\u201d, allowing them to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/26/supermarket-beer-sales-overtook-pub-sales-first-time-last-year\">subsidise drinks prices</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/who-said-it-pub-landlord-al-murray-or-jd-wetherspoon-founder-tim-martin\">Who said it: Pub Landlord Al Murray, or JD Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut most of the big companies say nothing about it. Because the people running them are taking too short-term an approach; they\u2019re there for five years, they\u2019re not looking 10 or 20 years down the line,\u201d Martin says. He worries about millennials binge-drinking cheap supermarket spirits at home, instead of learning \u201csocial drinking\u201d in pubs, which have \u201cmore or less become ghettos now for adults. Some sort of system that allowed 16-year-olds to have a beer or two in a pub would be good.\u201d</p> <p>Martin might not share all of Al Murray\u2019s views about Europe, but he is a big fan. He\u2019s sure it was Murray who assured an anxious post-referendum public: \u201cCrisps will remain at the current price,\u201d and named as his most extravagant possession: \u201cMy wife, and even she\u2019s a bit mean.\u201d In both instances, it was actually him \u2013 which, of course, only makes him laugh again. \u201cShould have got the crisps right.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is a tendency to overendow political events with economic significance. However, the 2016 US presidential election could deliver a tectonic shift in international economic relations. For the most part, the candidates\u2019 platforms are standard, partisan fare. Hillary Clinton argues for investment in education and infrastructure, and a higher minimum wage. Donald Trump, too, advocates infrastructure spending along with tax cuts and the repeal of Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law. However, one issue simultaneously distinguishes the main contenders from previous nominees while separating one from the other. Since at least 1945, it has been a near article of faith in the west that free trade is an engine of growth. No candidate for either main US party has sought to roll back trade liberalisation. Until now. Previously in favour of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a draft of which she once described as \u201cthe gold standard in trade agreements\u201d, Hillary Clinton now opposes it. Her reason is that it provides insufficient protection to American workers whose jobs and living standards it might harm. Donald Trump is more strident still, and quite distinctly different from any candidate since 1928. Then, Herbert Hoover won the White House promising farmers that he would raise agricultural tariffs to protect them. In 1930, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which increased levies on a range of goods, not just farm products. The consequent retaliation of other nations intensified the Depression-era slump in world trade. On his visits to Pittsburgh, once the crucible of US steel production, Trump told audiences that the industry\u2019s demise was down to bad trade deals negotiated by incompetent bureaucrats. He promised to conclude good, tough deals and bring back steel. While the likely content of a Trump trade policy is unclear, he has threatened tariffs of 45% on China and 35% on Mexico. He says withdrawing the US from the World Trade Organisation is an option and that he will break or renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The dogs on the street seem to know that Clinton\u2019s position is an electoral convenience. Pushed by Bernie Sanders, she threw TPP overboard in the primaries but will throw it a lifebelt in office, the argument runs. Rhetorically at least, Trump seems set on holing the world trading system below the waterline. If he expects other countries meekly to accept tariff hikes, he will be sorely disappointed. This antipathy to free trade baffles conventionally schooled policymakers who believe, correctly, that it makes us better off on average. While most people win, however, some lose and lose badly. Economists David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson have shown that in parts of the US exposed to competition from China, unemployment has risen, pay has fallen and the number claiming benefits has increased. The winners\u2019 gains are spread thinly and widely. The losers\u2019 losses tend to be deep and are often concentrated in specific areas, around cities such as Pittsburgh. Although the winners could compensate the losers leaving everyone better off, neither in the US nor elsewhere have we found a way to do that. Trade adjustment assistance \u2013 payments to US workers affected by import competition \u2013 has not offset the effects of job losses. Electoral college maths makes states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania crucial to the outcome of the race. They more than most have lost jobs to import competition. In this context, railing against trade makes sense. Continuing that in office would leave the US, and others, worse off. Even if Clinton wins and, once in office, tacks towards a freer trade position, this issue will not go away. More Americans believe trade lowers wages and costs jobs than the opposite. This is not just an American phenomenon. In Germany, fewer than two-fifths of people support an EU-US free trade agreement. Among the explanations for the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU is that the places that voted most for Brexit were those that had lost most in trade with China. Free trade has been a source of economic progress. But winning that case in the public square will no longer be achieved though facts, figures and smart debating points. People need to be convinced, through governments\u2019 actions, that trade agreements will be properly enforced and that when jobs are threatened there is genuine compensation for the losers. Fail to do that and we will undermine one of the most effective means of improving living standards. Stephen Boyle is chief economist at NatWest",

      "bodyText": "Before we close up for the day, here is a summary of some of the main developments. US markets opened slightly lower, but are now up. Following eight straight days of losses, Wall Street appears to have been boosted by the non-farm payrolls report. It was a solid jobs report, with no nasty shocks and an unexpected jump in wages. It does raise the prospect of a rate hike in December, but this was already the expectation. If the S&amp;P 500 were to close down (it is currently up 0.2%), it would mark the longest running streak since 1980. Across the Atlantic, European markets are far more jittery about the prospect of a Trump victory at Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. The FTSE is the biggest faller of the major indices, down 1.4% at 6,692. The pound meanwhile is back above the $1.25 mark for the first time since 6 October. UK new car sales grew modestly in October, by 1.4%. In the eurozone, a series of PMI surveys suggested the single currency bloc got off to a reasonable start in the fourth quarter, mainly thanks to Germany. That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for all your comments and please join us again on Monday. Have a great weekend. AM. Berenberg\u2019s chart of the week: Mickey Levy, Berenberg\u2019s US chief economist: The 2016 Presidential elections have been a painful story focused on two deeply flawed and damaged candidates. The winner will carry burdens into the White House. The latest polls are pointing to a Hillary Clinton victory and Republicans maintaining control of the House of Representatives. The Senate is a tossup. Congress is crucially important \u2013 plurality in each chamber conveys leadership of every committee \u2013 and will determine policy deliberations as well as many appointments in the new administration . Here in Greece, the EU\u2019s economic tsar Pierre Moscovici has ignited a fierce row with Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister. With a few choice words in his new book, \u201cMidnight in Europe\u201d Moscovici not only accuses the ex finance minister of \u201cunbridled narcissism\u201d but says his negotiating tactics with international creditors at the height of the euro crisis in 2015 did much to exacerbate Greece\u2019s ailing economy. With his frantic pre-occupation with the media and unbridled narcissism, Varoufakis drew the limelight on himself and for several months cannabilised the discussions. He contributed to the tension at the talks by refusing any negotiation. Varoufakis hit back on Friday: The more the third memorandum crumbles, the more determined, it seems, they are to honour me with their hate because I didn\u2019t sign it. I thank them again. Here is our full story on the US jobs report: US markets have opened down, as US election jitters and the prospect of a December rate hike weigh on investors\u2019 minds. Losses are very modest so far. Dow Jones: flat (down 0.1 points) at 17,931 S&amp;P 500: -0.04% at 2,088 Nasdaq: -0.4% at 5,038 Northern Ireland\u2019s bid to become a more attractive place to American firms and tourists was dealt a blow on Friday. United Airlines is pulling the plug on the only direct flight to the US, from from Belfast International Airport to Newark, after the EU blocked regional government state aid to the airline. It was due to receive \u00a39m keep the route going but this was blocked by the European Commission today, and as a result the American carrier will pull its service in January. The airport\u2019s managing dfirector, Graham Keddie, described the EU decision-making process as \u201cabysmal, biased and unfair.\u201d He continued: \u201cThis is a vital link for business and losing it will be a body blow to executive ministers who use it to promote Northern Ireland to would-be investors from the United States.\u201d The Ulster Unionist Party described the loss of the service as an \u201cinternational embarrassment.\u201d Brussels\u2019 decision will be seized upon by the pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party as further evidence of European bureaucrats over-riding the democratic wishes of the local power sharing executive and endangering jobs. James Knightley, a senior economist at ING, says a December rate hike is now more likely, but it isn\u2019t a done deal: It seems as though the tightness in the labour market is starting to generate higher pay. The wage story is also good news for consumer spending with average hourly earnings not having risen this fast since mid 2009. So with the economy creating jobs and workers being paid more, it backs the case for a rate hike from the Federal Reserve in December. However, it isn\u2019t a done deal. Any market turmoil relating to next week\u2019s Presidential election would quickly scupper thoughts of a policy change. Capital Economics says the \u201csurge\u201d in US wages signals the Fed will raise rates in December. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist, writes: The solid gain in employment and the acceleration in average hourly earnings growth in October will increase expectations that the Fed will hike interest rates in December (assuming that the election doesn\u2019t throw a spanner in the works.) What will really catch the eye of Fed officials is the 0.4% m/m increase in average hourly earnings last month, which followed an upwardly revised 0.3% m/m gain in September. As a result, the annual growth rate climbed to a seven-year high of 2.8%, from 2.7%. The US unemployment rate fell to 4.9% in October from 5% in September, as expected. The US Labor Department said average hourly earnings grew at an annual rate of 2.8%, the highest in seven years and better than the 2.6% expected. At 161,000, employment growth in October was weaker than the monthly average of 181,000 for 2016. The average monthly increase was 229,000 in 2015. While the October payrolls figure slightly missed expectations, there were no nasty surprises in the report. US futures narrowed losses after the report. US non-farm payrolls increased by 161,000 in October, disappointing expectations of a 175,000 rise. The number for September was revised up sharply to 191,000 from an initial estimate of 156,000. More to follow. The dollar is on track for its worst week in 12 as fears mount that Trump will win the election next week. The US currency has fallen 1.2% this week against a basket of major currencies. Jane Foley, currency strategist at Rabobank: Political uncertainty tends to be currency-negative because the markets find it more difficult to work out how things like trade policy foreign policy are going to play out in the economy. The pound has just hit $1.25 for the first time since early October... But UK markets are leading losses in Europe: FTSE 100: down 1.4% at 6,696 FTSE 250: down 1.9% at 331 Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at Spreadex, says markets are having a \u201cfull on panic attack\u201d over the possibility that Donald Trump will be the next US President. Well what started as a few jitters morphed into a full on panic attack this Friday, the European indices plunging at the prospect of Trump moving into the White House. Looking ahead to this afternoon and, at the moment at least, the Dow Jones futures are suggesting the US index won\u2019t be quite as heavily hit after the bell. And he has this to say on today\u2019s non-farm payrolls report from the US, to be published in a little over half an hour. Among all this election chaos comes the US non-farm jobs report for October. Now, one could argue that this is the most pointless non-farm Friday of the year given the proximity of the election, and the fact that the month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting has already happened. However, the Fed stated on Wednesday that it only needs to see a bit more evidence that the US economy is in decent health before it feels confident enough to raise rates meaning that, in the eventuality of a Clinton victory, today\u2019s set of jobs data may become more important in retrospect. Economists are expecting a payrolls to rise by 175,000... The pound has hit a four-week high against the dollar at $1.2497, up o.2% on the day. The rise in the pound is partly a story of dollar weakness, but also Thursday\u2019s message from the Bank of England that a rate cut is off the table for now, and the government\u2019s Brexit loss in the High Court: Oil prices are on course for a sixth day of declines, driven lower by a rise in US crude stocks and softer demand. Brent crude oil is down 0.3% at $46.20. Analysts said markets were also being hit by investor nerves, as traders pull out money ahead of the US presidential election. Oliver Jakob from the consultancy Petromatrix told Reuters: There has been a very strong retreat and technically, prices are starting to reach oversold levels. Investors will look at US non farm payrolls later in the day but I think there will be a pause for a few days ahead of the US elections. Consumer appetite for new cars has seemed unstoppable in recent years as cheap finance deals and more efficient models have boosted the number of deals. UK new car sales increased again in October, but at a slower rate of 1.4%, compared with 1.6 in September - a plate change month when sales are typically higher. Fleet sales drove the rise in October, while private sales fell 1.1% compared with the same month last year according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. A total of 180,168 new cars were registered in the UK last month, taking the total in the first 10 months of the year to 2.3 million - 2.5% higher than at the same point in 2015. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said: September\u2019s number plate change is always a hard act to follow so the market\u2019s growth in October, albeit moderate, is welcome news. Low interest rates, affordable finance packages and a range of exciting new models helped attract buyers into showrooms and we now look to government to ensure consumer and business confidence remains buoyant.\u201d As election anxiety reigns, the S&amp;P 500 is on course for its longest losing streak since 1980 if it falls again today. CMC Markets are predicting US markets will open lower. Market analyst Jasper Lawler: Stocks in the US look set for a lower open with investors fretting over the election ahead of the October non-farm payrolls report that could act to confirm a move to higher interest rates in December. There is some selling-exhaustion in US equities so the unemployment figures could help form a short-term base before the election next week. The market is assigning an 80% chance the Fed will hike rates in December so it would take a huge labour market downturn for a single unemployment report to change the course of monetary policy. Neil Wilson, market analyst at ETX Capital, says markets are on a \u201cknife-edge\u201d before Americans go to the polls on Tuesday: With Donald Trump having closed the gap on Hillary Clinton the election result is too close to call and markets are on a knife-edge. There is a definite sense we\u2019re heading for a Brexit-like event \u2013 if Trump wins there could be a sharper selloff in risky assets like stocks and the US dollar. If Clinton wins, a rally is on the cards. Ignoring the longer-term implications, there is a strong chance of immediate and significant movements in prices \u2013 particularly as we get results in from key swing states such as Ohio and Florida. And because so many hang in the balance there is a strong chance that markets will overreact when an individual state is called. Back in June the pound plunged 5% in a matter of seconds when Sunderland voted heavily for Leave. We could see similar gyrations in a broader range of markets, particularly if volumes are down overnight. Ben Broadbent, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has been giving radio interviews following the Bank\u2019s updated forecasts and decision to hold rates on Thursday. The Bank raised its forecasts for growth in the short-term, admitting it had been too pessimistic about prospects in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. Policymakers at Threadneedle Street were predicting growth of just 0.1% in the third quarter, but it came in much stronger at 0.5%. The Bank also told households to prepare for a sharp rise in inflation next year. Broadbent said it was perfectly normal to adjust expectations \u201cas news comes in\u201d. He told BBC Radio 4 Today\u2019s programme that he was pleased Mark Carney would remain as the Bank\u2019s governor until 2019, a year longer than he initially signed up for: I\u2019m extremely happy that the current governor is staying. I think the whole country should be grateful that he is. European markets are falling deeper into the red as unease continues to build ahead of Tuesday\u2019s US election. Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank, offers this insight into markets and the election. While the political risk has increased with national polls narrowing, Clinton continues to have the lead. CNN polls indicate that Clinton has a 46% to 45% lead of Trump. Heading into the last weekend before America heads to the polls, anything can happen. Markets should continue to trade with caution ahead of the weekend and the US election, with risk skewed to the downside. History suggests that regardless of who is in the White House (think President Obama), the USA still remains largely unaffected by a single individual. The numbers are all in now, and the broad indication from the eurozone PMIs is that the signal currency bloc\u2019s economy gained momentum in October, mainly thanks to Germany. The composite PMI (combining manufacturing surveys earlier in the week and services surveys today) rose to 53.3 in October from 52.6 in September. Here is how countries ranked on the PMI by output growth. (Anything above 50 signals growth.) Germany: 55.1 Spain: 54.4 Ireland: 54 France: 51.6 Italy: 51.1 Markit\u2019s Germany services sector PMI showed steady growth in October. The headline index edged up to 54.2 from 54.1 in September, in line with expectations. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at IHS Markit, said the survey from Europe\u2019s largest economy was positive: Today\u2019s survey results present a welcome rebound in German service sector activity, after September\u2019s data highlighted fears of a substantial slowdown in the sector. The service sector data follow positive numbers from the manufacturing sector, released earlier in the week. The combined output of both sectors points to the second-strongest rate of expansion so far this year and suggests that the German economy continued to grow at the start of the fourth quarter. Growth slowed in the French services sector in October according to the PMI. The headline index fell to 51.4 from 52.1 on September, missing forecasts that growth would be stable. Markit said companies were not seeing a big pick up in new business growth. Alex Gill: Growth in the French service sector abated at the start of the fourth quarter, with activity increasing at the slowest rate in three months. This was indicative of waning new business growth, as further solid cuts to output prices proved insufficient to prevent the slide. On a more positive note, business expectations remained strong, suggesting companies are hopeful conditions will continue to improve in the months ahead. The Italian services sector grew in October, albeit at a weak rate. The headline index on Markit\u2019s PMI rose to 51 from 50.7 in September, where anything above 50 signals expansion. It was a little below expectations of 51.5. This is what Markit\u2019s Phil Smith had to say: It\u2019s been a sluggish start to the fourth quarter for Italy\u2019s economy. While expansion in service sector activity picked up slightly in October, it remained weak overall and was countered by a slowdown in growth of manufacturing output. There was also little to cheer on the employment front, with the rate of job creation across the two sectors combined barely stronger than September\u2019s 12-month low. Growth in Spain\u2019s services sector was roughly stable in October, but the pick up in new orders and employment slowed. The headline index on Markit\u2019s PMI eased to 54.6 last month from 54.7 in September, but it was lower than expected, with economists polled by Reuters predicting 55.2. Inflationary signs were evident, with the sharpest increase in companies\u2019 costs since May 2015. IHS Markit is forecasting the Spanish economy will grow by 3.1% in 2016, slowing to 2% in 2017. Andrew Harker, senior economist at IHS Markit: While the headline activity index for the Spain services PMI suggested further solid growth in October, other indices were less bullish. Rates of increase in new orders and employment eased and companies suggested that sales wins were often a result of promotional activities. Europe has followed Asia and the US, with markets down in early trading. The FTSE 100 is off 53 points. FTSE 100: -0.8% at 6,737 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.4% at 10,282 France\u2019s CAC: -0.2% at 4,404 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 16,333 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.3% at 8,854 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.4% at 330 The pound rose on Thursday to a near one-month high of $1.2494 (still 16% lower than the day of the EU referendum). It was boosted by a number of factors, including the government\u2019s loss of the Brexit case at the High Court, the signal from the Bank of England that further rate cuts are off the table for the time being, and a weaker dollar. The pound is roughly flat this morning, at $1.2466. It\u2019s non-farm payrolls day in the US. The figures will be published at 12.30pm UK time and are expected to show a 175,000 jump in jobs added in October, following 156,000 in September. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 4.9% from 5%. The payrolls data are closely watched and economists and investors will be looking for anything in the data that suggests a Fed rate rise in December is more or less likely. Realistically however, the presidential election on Tuesday will be uppermost in investor minds, rather than the payrolls report and implications for December. Also this morning we have the latest healthcheck from the eurozone\u2019s services sector, with October PMI surveys. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors around the world are turning their attention to the US presidential election on Tuesday next week. With the polls narrowing, uncertainty is rising, and with so many twists and turns in the campaign so far, investor nerves are mounting as the poll draws closer. Wall Street closed down for an eighth successive day on Friday, marking the longest run of losses since the financial crisis in 2008. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, gives this insight: With only a few more days to US polling day the closeness of the polls continues to jangle nerves in the market, with the result that the declines appear to be gaining a momentum all of their own. This negative sentiment is also spilling over into Europe\u2019s markets as they also slip back as the weaker US dollar pushes up the pound and the euro, as we look again at the potential for another negative open this morning. Most Asian markets followed Wall Street lower, with the Nikkei down 1.3% at 16,905. Meanwhile the Vix volatility index \u2013 a measure of investor confidence known as the \u201cfear gauge\u201d \u2013 rose for the eighth day in succession. European stock markets are also expected to open lower:",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "New car sales in the UK continued to rise last month as strong growth in businesses buying company vehicles outweighed falling demand from private buyers for a seventh month. Economists focused on the latest deterioration in private car deals, warning that the figures suggest consumers are less willing to make big purchases. A total of 180,168 new cars were registered in October, up 1.4% from a year earlier, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Fleet car registrations drove the growth, up 4.2%, while sales to private buyers fell by 1.1% and have fallen every month since April. Many companies are likely to have made decisions about buying fleet cars before the outcome of the EU referendum, which means it will take some time before the impact of the Brexit vote can be assessed. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the data highlighted a \u201csignificant deterioration in consumers\u2019 willingness to make major purchases\u201d, with the recent fall in sterling further depressing demand by pushing up manufacturing costs which in turn pushes up prices. Most cars are imported, and those that are assembled here rely on components made abroad. He noted: \u201cRecent increases in list prices by manufacturers in response to sterling\u2019s depreciation, averaging about 2%, likely have contributed to depressing sales too. Manufacturers have warned that these increases are just the first step in their response to the lower pound.\u201d Ford, General Motors\u2019 Vauxhall division and Nissan are among the carmakers that have hiked prices by 1.5% to 2% in the UK in response to the pound\u2019s slump, according to Automotive News Europe. Only some of this has been passed on to consumers by car retailers, the official data suggests, and other increases have only come into effect in October, Tombs explained. Car sales are likely to hold up for now given low interest rates and the abundance of cheap finance deals. Car sales hit a record for the month of September of 469,696, up 1.6%, as buyers rushed to get the new 66 plate. Sales are 2.5% ahead of 2015 in the year to date, with 2.3m vehicles hitting the road. Last year, sales hit a record of 2.63m and the SMMT predicts a new high of 2.68m cars this year. The industry body is forecasting a drop of 5% for 2017. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Markit, said: \u201cThe serious concern for the car sector going forward is that it looks inevitable that consumers\u2019 purchasing power will progressively weaken over the coming months as inflation rises appreciably and earnings growth is muted \u2013 which will dilute consumers\u2019 ability and likely willingness to splash out on big ticket items like cars.\u201d Hybrid and electric cars are still proving popular, with sales up 12.4% in October and 23% so far this year to 75,987 \u2013 the highest level ever achieved in the first 10 months of the year.",

      "bodyText": "The US economy added 161,000 jobs in October, the final jobs report before the election. The unemployment rate dipped to 4.9%. The figure was below the 175,000 economists had forecast for the month but August\u2019s jobs number was revised up to 176,000 from 167,000, and September was revised to 191,000 from 156,000. Wage growth accelerated to its strongest pace since the recession. Though much of the electoral discussion has hinged on the economic woes of the middle class, the latest figures were broadly inline with expectations and are unlikely to affect the election itself this close to the opening of the polls on Tuesday. Labor secretary Thomas Perez said he believed continuing growth in the healthcare sector in particular was due to the passage of the controversial Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010. \u201cThe folks who said the Affordable Care Act was going to be a job-killer aren\u2019t looking at the data,\u201d Perez said. \u201cAs the ACA has really kicked in over the last two years we\u2019ve seen solid job growth in the hospital sector as well. More people are using healthcare.\u201d \u201cThe three-month moving average of job growth was 176,000, about double the pace needed to keep up with underlying growth in the labor force, allowing for a continued diminishment of labor market slack,\u201d said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist with PNC.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, has said the whole country should be grateful that Mark Carney is staying on as governor until 2019. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Broadbent also said the pound could rebound if the economy continued to surprise on the positive side. Carney ended speculation about his future earlier this week by agreeing to stay on until Brexit negotiations with the EU have ended in 2019. This means he will serve an extra year, but that is still two years short of a full eight-year term. Broadbent said: \u201cI\u2019m extremely happy that the current governor is staying. I think the whole country should be grateful that he is.\u201d When asked whether he would like to be the Bank\u2019s next governor \u2013 Paddy Power is offering odds of 7-4 on this happening \u2013 Broadbent, a former Goldman Sachs economist, said: \u201cHe [Carney] is staying on another almost three years. That is far too far away for me to think about what I\u2019m going to be doing then ... I haven\u2019t even thought about it.\u201d His comments came the day after the central bank lifted its growth forecasts and warned households to expect a sharp rise in inflation next year as the weak pound pushes up the cost of imports. It hinted that further interest rate cuts were unlikely because the economy has held up better than expected since the referendum, with consumer spending particularly strong. Broadbent said: \u201cIt is apparent that financial markets have taken one view and implicitly so far at least households so far have taken another. We don\u2019t know who is more right because we don\u2019t yet know how this process [Brexit] will unfold. \u201cPresumably at some point there will be something of a reconciliation and if it turns out better than financial markets are currently expecting for the economy over the longer run then you\u2019d expect to see the currency bounce back.\u201d He rejected criticism from the Brexit camp that the Bank was out of touch with the real economy. \u201cIt\u2019s always the case that we have to revise our view as news comes in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe widened our fan charts [growth and inflation predictions] in August following the result of the referendum precisely because of the more uncertain environment we are now confronted with.\u201d The Bank has come under heavy criticism recently, including from the prime minister, who at the Conservative party conference criticised the \u201cbad side effects\u201d of ultra-low interest rates and the Bank\u2019s money creation programme. Broadbent responded: \u201cWe live in a democracy. People can comment on the way all our policies are conducted. It is our job to be open and transparent about what we do. For our part we\u2019re just focused on our job. We have a remit given to us by parliament and we look at all the economic evidence and as economists regarding that remit we take the best possible decision we can at any point in time.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With investors continuing to be unnerved by the prospect of Donald Trump winning next week\u2019s US presidential election, leading shares are on the slide again. Pharmaceutical shares are under pressure after US lawmakers called on federal regulators to open a probe on potential price fixing for insulin and diabetes drugs. Although not mentioned, Hikma is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down 146p at \u00a315.99 after HSBC analysts cut their target price from \u00a325.25 to \u00a319.85 and warned all generic drugmakers could become caught up in a US Department of Justice investigation. But Numis moved from hold to buy ahead of an update from Hikma next week: Hikma\u2019s shares are down 35% over three months and have significantly under- performed UK Mid-Cap Healthcare (+6%) and Global Specialty Pharma (-2%). The key risk to the investment case following the downgrades in August to 2016 forecasts are margin expectations from Generics that have disappointed since the acquisition of Roxane, which completed in early 2016. A third quarter update is expected next week and in the short term, a reduction to group revenue expectations for 2016 would be a disappointment, but in the absence of competition for Glycopyrrolate, view this as unlikely. A further reduction in margins for generics in 2016 is entirely possible, although we would argue this is now in the price. We take a more cautious stance on Generic margins into 2017, and reduce our earnings per share forecasts by 13% to 136c (consensus 156c). We see third quarter results on 10th November and the \u201cMeet the Management\u201d event on 15th November as the catalysts for a re-rating. The shares trade on 16 times 2017 PE for 23% earnings per share growth on our downgraded assumptions. We reduce our target price to 2,350p, which equates to 21 times 2017. This implies 35% upside on a 12- month view and so move to buy. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 95.11 points to 6695.40, on track for its biggest one day fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the continued Brexit brouhaha muddying the waters it is hard to see anything challenge the election for market dominance from now until next Wednesday, if Clinton wins, or god knows how long, in the eventuality of a Trump victory. The falls are across the board. British Airways owner International Airlines Group is down 16.1p to 434.7p despite telling investors it was sticking to its earnings and margins growth targets for now to 2020 despite the difficult trading environment. Dixons Carphone is down 12.6p at 328.9p on concerns about a coming squeeze on UK consumer spending, while Randgold Resources has fallen 220p to \u00a368.90. But Paddy Power Betfair has bucked the trend, up 285p to \u00a388.65 after it increased its full year profit forecast from \u00a3365m-\u00a3385m to \u00a3390m-\u00a3405m, citing the benefits of a weaker pound on its euro revenues. It reported earnings of \u00a3113m in the three months to the end of September, up 53%. Among the mid-caps DFS Furniture has fallen nearly 13% to 230.1p as US private equity firm Advent International sold a 12% stake in the business at 240p a share, cutting its investment in the retailer in half.",

      "body": "<p>With investors continuing to be unnerved by the prospect of Donald Trump winning next week\u2019s US presidential election, leading shares are on the slide again.</p> <p>Pharmaceutical shares are under pressure after US lawmakers called on federal regulators to open a probe on potential price fixing for insulin and diabetes drugs.</p> <p>Although not mentioned, <strong>Hikma</strong> is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down 146p at \u00a315.99 after HSBC analysts cut their target price from \u00a325.25 to \u00a319.85 and warned all generic drugmakers could become caught up in a US Department of Justice investigation.</p> <p>But Numis moved from hold to buy ahead of an update from Hikma next week:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hikma\u2019s shares are down 35% over three months and have significantly under- performed UK Mid-Cap Healthcare (+6%) and Global Specialty Pharma (-2%). The key risk to the investment case following the downgrades in August to 2016 forecasts are margin expectations from Generics that have disappointed since the acquisition of Roxane, which completed in early 2016.</p> <p>A third quarter update is expected next week and in the short term, a reduction to group revenue expectations for 2016 would be a disappointment, but in the absence of competition for Glycopyrrolate, view this as unlikely. A further reduction in margins for generics in 2016 is entirely possible, although we would argue this is now in the price.</p> <p>We take a more cautious stance on Generic margins into 2017, and reduce our earnings per share forecasts by 13% to 136c (consensus 156c). We see third quarter results on 10th November and the \u201cMeet the Management\u201d event on 15th November as the catalysts for a re-rating. The shares trade on 16 times 2017 PE for 23% earnings per share growth on our downgraded assumptions. We reduce our target price to 2,350p, which equates to 21 times 2017. This implies 35% upside on a 12- month view and so move to buy. </p> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has fallen 95.11 points to 6695.40, on track for its biggest one day fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the continued Brexit brouhaha muddying the waters it is hard to see anything challenge the election for market dominance from now until next Wednesday, if Clinton wins, or god knows how long, in the eventuality of a Trump victory.</p> </blockquote> <p>The falls are across the board. British Airways owner <strong>International Airlines Group </strong>is down 16.1p to 434.7p despite telling investors it was sticking to its earnings and margins growth targets for now to 2020 despite the difficult trading environment.</p> <p><strong>Dixons Carphone</strong> is down 12.6p at 328.9p on concerns about a coming squeeze on UK consumer spending, while Randgold Resources has fallen 220p to \u00a368.90.</p> <p>But <strong>Paddy Power Betfair</strong> has bucked the trend, up 285p to \u00a388.65 after it increased its full year profit forecast from \u00a3365m-\u00a3385m to \u00a3390m-\u00a3405m, citing the benefits of a weaker pound on its euro revenues. It reported earnings of \u00a3113m in the three months to the end of September, up 53%.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>DFS Furniture</strong> has fallen nearly 13% to 230.1p as US private equity firm Advent International sold a 12% stake in the business at 240p a share, cutting its investment in the retailer in half.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Growing uncertainty about the outcome of the US presidential election has sent European and Asian shares falling again while the market\u2019s \u201cfear gauge\u201d jumped for the eighth day in a row. Stocks in Japan, Australia and South Korea saw a broad selloff as investors pondered the possible ramifications of a Donald Trump presidency, overshadowing important market data including Friday\u2019s US employment figures for October. Europe followed Asia and the US markets lower. The FTSE 100 index in London fell more than 50 points, or 0.8%, to 6,737 in early trading. Germany\u2019s Dax was off 0.4%, France\u2019s CAC slid 0.2%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB lost 0.5% and Spain\u2019s Ibex was down 0.3%. Hillary Clinton, who is seen as the status quo candidate by markets, maintained her narrow poll lead over Trump, the Republican candidate regarded as a much riskier occupant of the White House. The pound was flat on Friday, at around $1.2466, hitting a one-month high of $1.2494 on Thursday, after the government lost its Brexit case at the high court and the Bank of England signalled that further rate cuts were unlikely. That is still 16% lower than the day of the EU referendum. Following an eighth straight day of losses on Wall Street\u2019s S&amp;P500 index on Thursday \u2013 its worst losing streak since the 2008 global financial crisis \u2013 Asian bourses suffered the same fate on Friday. The Nikkei in Japan dropped 1.3%. The US election jitters have pushed the value of the greenback down, pushing investors to the safe haven of the yen, which in turn punishes Japanese shares. In Australia, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 closed down 0.8% after earlier touching on a four-month low. The country\u2019s banks, which make up a large chunk of the market\u2019s value, led the losses. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was also slightly in the red, down 0.18%. The Vix volatility index \u2013 a measure of investor confidence known as the \u201cfear gauge\u201d \u2013 spiked for the eighth day in succession. \u201cEven if opinion polls show that Clinton is maintaining a lead, anything can happen at the last minute, something the Brexit outcome taught us,\u201d said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, referring to the UK\u2019s surprising vote in June to leave the European Union. Trump, a political novice, has campaigned to clamp down on immigration, rethink trade relations and slap high tariffs on imported goods. Some fear his election would pose risks for global trade and growth. \u201cThere remains scope for a significant selloff if Trump wins,\u201d wrote Ric Spooner at CMC Markets in Australia. \u201cMarkets are currently attempting to strike the right balance between the greater probability of a Clinton win and the possibility of a significant selloff on a Trump victory,\u201d Spooner said. \u201cThe more the market falls in advance of the election, the greater the potential for volatility and a significant bounce if Clinton does get up.\u201d Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at Spreadex, said: \u201cThe prospect of a Trump presidency, however unlikely that still may be, has sent the FTSE down a further 50 points this morning, taking the UK index to its lowest level since mid-September. \u201cDespite the continued Brexit brouhaha muddying the waters it is hard to see anything challenge the election for market dominance from now until next Wednesday, if Clinton wins, or god knows how long, in the eventuality of a Trump victory.\u201d The non-farm payrolls report due later on Friday is expected to show employers added 175,000 jobs in October, according to the median estimate of 106 economists polled by Reuters. US data on Thursday showed that services industry activity cooled last month amid a slowdown in new orders and hiring, while planned job cuts by US-based employers dropped 31% to a five-month low. That underscored the labour market\u2019s healthy fundamentals, though more Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week. The pound was a stand-out performer overnight, rising to a nearly one-month high of $1.2494 on Thursday after a British court ruled that the government needs parliamentary approval to start the process of leaving the European Union. That could potentially delay Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plans. The pound also got a boost from the Bank of England, which scrapped its plan to cut interest rates and ramped up its forecasts for growth. Sterling was up 0.1% at $1.2476, poised to gain 2.4% for the week. Oil prices took back some ground after settling down more than 1% on Thursday as investors reacted to a record weekly surge in US crude inventories and remained sceptical that Opec will actually implement its planned output curbs. US crude added 0.2% to $44.76 per barrel. Brent crude also rose 0.2% to $46.46.",
