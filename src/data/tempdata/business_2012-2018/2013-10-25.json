      "bodyText": "'You see, I don't want that watermelon. But if I did, that would stop it going in to landfill.\" Simon Barnes, 47, and I are standing by the reduced aisle in a Tesco store in Kennington, south London. In fact, I do want the watermelon. However, I feel that it would be infra dig to conduct this interview carrying a watermelon. This was the week in which Tesco revealed that it had binned 30,000 tonnes of food waste in the first half of 2013. Like holding their nose and jumping into a cold pool, Tesco bosses decided that the transparency was worth the opprobrium, which I think will turn out to be true. The main thing that struck a chord was not the profligacy of supermarkets but the elegiac decay of the bagged salad: more than two-thirds of it thrown out, half by customers, half by stores. So much waste, so little actual ingestion. It's like a leafy metaphor for the good intention. Picturing Tesco's statistic, however, one imagines heaps of food out back, baked goods piled high on maroon plastic crates, a totem of pointless waste. That's just not how it works any more. The total waste along the food value chain (this is how they talk, OK?) is 32%; 16% is wasted in \"agriculture and supply\"; 16% by the consumer. The amount wasted by retailers is, they say, less than 1%. Shoppers could and do argue that their waste is spurred by supermarket offers; farmers could and do argue that their waste is caused by factors outside their control, such as: \"I cannot eat this parsnip because it looks like the gnarly hand of a wizard.\" The fact remains that, when you go into a Tesco superstore, the operation is as lean as a hare. \"People come in at around half eight, because that's when things start to get really cheap,\" Barbara, the deputy store manager in Kennington, explains. \"We make an announcement on the PA and people will be here immediately.\" Nigel Leigh, 58, is a one-time university lecturer and documentary maker. He arrives from nowhere, like Nanny McPhee. A minute ago, there was only a fruit salad, a watermelon, and some pre-cooked rice noodles, only modestly reduced from \u00a31.20 to 71p. Suddenly, there are three ready meals, one of which is a mushroom risotto for 36p, 10% of its original price, and Nigel has it. His manner is that of a mischievous soothsayer. How did he know? There was no announcement. \"I'm the guy you're looking for. There's a certain kind of bottom feeding shopper. And I'm it,\" Nigel explains. There are people who will buy things simply because they're on the reduced shelf, before they have been marked down still further. Those people are stupid, thinks Nigel. \"But you can make a mistake the other way. You can see something that you actually really want, but you know it's not as reduced as it could be. So you leave it for a while. But guess what \u2013 there are other people in this store as well, and they will buy it. You can't let yourself go home miserable if you've only got a discount of 50%.\" Nigel does, inevitably, have rivals. \"There's a guy who comes in, I think he's a Korean student. If I see him, I may as well go home. He'll have the lot.\" And there are other people who don't abide by the code of honour. \"They go to the shelf, put everything in their cart, and then, like an animal, they'll take it away and look at it somewhere else. Bring back the stuff they've decided they don't want.\" But if there's competition, there's no ill-will. \"Me and them, the guy who supplies the shelf, the guy who takes it off the shelf, we're all victims of a world economy over which we have very little control.\" There's a tub of clotted cream sitting like an orphan on the shelf. \"The important thing is,\" Simon underlines by picking it up and waving it about, \"never to buy things that you're not going to eat.\" Earlier Svetlana, 29, made a similar point. \"I am always throwing away cream.\" I catch up with Nigel again near the dried goods. \"I've got wealthy friends with big houses in Barnes, they love me to regale them with tales from the reduce-to-clear life. Their wives think it's there-but-for-the-grace-of-God-go-I. But I think it's a little taste of the Serengeti. It's a system that rewards the quick and the brave. The decisive. You need to know what you want, know where it is, and take it. \"I'm just playing around with capitalism's artificial pricing system. I will get it at my price.

The spokesman stressed that it is \"standard practice\", saying there was no possibility of a conflict of interest because of \"Chinese walls\" between different banking divisions.</p> <p>However, Adrian Bailey, the chairman of the House of Commons business committee and a Labour MP, late Friday raised questions about the process, saying he plans to grill ministers about how many shares were offered to each bank, their level of fees and their role in the valuation of the company.</p> <p>\"These are questions that I will ask on November 20th,\" he said. \"When you look at the balance between the retail and the institutional percentage of shares allocated, and the potential conflict of interest from the advisers, I think there are grounds for looking at the whole way privatisations are carried out in future. Unfortunately the government at the moment seems completely blind to that and the perception it creates\".</p> <p>The shares were allocated to the banking advisers separately from the \u00a316.9m of fees due to be paid for their role in the flotation, and may have been sold or added to at any point since the flotation date.</p> <p>Their allocation emerged after Labour peer Lord Donoughue asked the government how many shares were sold to the banking advisers who advised on the price of the flotation.</p> <p>Lord Popat, a Conservative whip, said no employee working on the transaction or investment bank division was allocated shares but \"other divisions of our banking advisers, separated from the investment banking divisions by the information barriers, were allocated 13m shares\".</p> <p>A senior banking source strongly denied any of the banks would directly profit from the being allocated shares, saying they would have been bought to help make money on behalf of clients in the asset management divisions. He said there were strict Chinese walls at the banks that mean those advising on the deals would not even ever have met those buying shares on behalf of clients.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs and UBS declined to comment.</p> <p>The news comes amid reports that JP Morgan put a possible top-of-the-range valuation on Royal Mail at \u00a310bn \u2013 more than three times the \u00a33.3bn that it was eventually sold for by the government.</p> <p>Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said there were now a \"wide range of questions being asked about the government's Royal Mail fire sale which Ministers need to answer\".</p> <p>\"While Vince Cable has claimed that guaranteeing taxpayer value was 'central' to his strategy, doubts are emerging on the process ministers put in place. We know that Vince Cable considered, and rejected, the option of getting a better deal for the taxpayer,\" he said.</p> <p>\"At a time when the public are seeing services cut back and their living standards squeezed, they will not forgive ministers if they are left short changed.\"</p>",

A spokesman for the Department of Business said the government's advisers, including Goldman Sachs, UBS and other junior advisers, were not given preferential treatment when shares were allocated and some did not get any at all. He refused to say how many shares were offered to each adviser. The spokesman stressed that it is \"standard practice\", saying there was no possibility of a conflict of interest because of \"Chinese walls\" between different banking divisions. However, Adrian Bailey, the chairman of the House of Commons business committee and a Labour MP, late Friday raised questions about the process, saying he plans to grill ministers about how many shares were offered to each bank, their level of fees and their role in the valuation of the company. \"These are questions that I will ask on November 20th,\" he said. \"When you look at the balance between the retail and the institutional percentage of shares allocated, and the potential conflict of interest from the advisers, I think there are grounds for looking at the whole way privatisations are carried out in future. Unfortunately the government at the moment seems completely blind to that and the perception it creates\". The shares were allocated to the banking advisers separately from the \u00a316.9m of fees due to be paid for their role in the flotation, and may have been sold or added to at any point since the flotation date. Their allocation emerged after Labour peer Lord Donoughue asked the government how many shares were sold to the banking advisers who advised on the price of the flotation. Lord Popat, a Conservative whip, said no employee working on the transaction or investment bank division was allocated shares but \"other divisions of our banking advisers, separated from the investment banking divisions by the information barriers, were allocated 13m shares\". A senior banking source strongly denied any of the banks would directly profit from the being allocated shares, saying they would have been bought to help make money on behalf of clients in the asset management divisions. He said there were strict Chinese walls at the banks that mean those advising on the deals would not even ever have met those buying shares on behalf of clients. Goldman Sachs and UBS declined to comment. The news comes amid reports that JP Morgan put a possible top-of-the-range valuation on Royal Mail at \u00a310bn \u2013 more than three times the \u00a33.3bn that it was eventually sold for by the government. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said there were now a \"wide range of questions being asked about the government's Royal Mail fire sale which Ministers need to answer\". \"While Vince Cable has claimed that guaranteeing taxpayer value was 'central' to his strategy, doubts are emerging on the process ministers put in place. We know that Vince Cable considered, and rejected, the option of getting a better deal for the taxpayer,\" he said. \"At a time when the public are seeing services cut back and their living standards squeezed, they will not forgive ministers if they are left short changed.\"",

Deutsche Bank calculates that the Hinkley Point contract will only be cheaper than gas generation if the crude oil price averages more than $150 per barrel in real terms over the next 40 years. \"This is around three times the average oil price over the last 40 years, and a 50% premium to the average oil price over the last five years,\" it explains.

Serco is scrambling to restore its reputation following a series of debacles ranging from failing to provide enough doctors in Cornwall to charging the government for electronic tags on dead prisoners. Chris Hyman, left with immediate effect on Friday after 20 years with the operator of hospitals, prisons and railways. He said he would \"step back\" from his chief executive role, held for 11 years, to allow relations with the government to be rebuilt.

He has options over shares, that if he were to cash in today would be worth an additional \u00a32m. A government spokesman welcomed his resignation \u2013 discussed with the Cabinet Office in advance and announced just weeks before the government is expected to decide whether to allow Serco to bid for future contracts . Serco generates a quarter of its revenues from government work and is attempting to placate the government after claims it had overcharged the Ministry of Justice by \"tens of millions\" of pounds for electronic tags for criminals. Last month Serco was put on notice it could be investigated by the Serious Fraud Office after charging the government for tagging criminals who were either dead, still in prison or who had never been tagged in the first place. The government said it would take \"full account of all the changes Serco have made\". \"Whilst it is early days in their programme of renewal, this is a positive move by Serco and a step forward,\" the government said. But Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who chairs the home affairs committee, said: \"I am surprised by the resignation of Mr Hyman who has always maintained that there is nothing untoward with the contracts that Serco holds with the government, even after the company was referred by secretary of state for justice to the SFO.\" Shares in Serco, which was demoted from the FTSE 100 last month after its shares fell sharply following the allegations over its tagging contracts, rose 1p to 557p after the surprise departure of Hyman.

The management upheaval came less than 24 hours after rival G4S, also caught up in the controversial electronic tagging fiasco, parted company with the head of its UK and Irish operations Richard Morris. The G4S chief executive, Nick Buckles, left in May. Both companies are being subjected to a government-wide review of every one of their contracts and have been ordered to prove they are taking steps to improve their operations. Serco, which was transformed into a major international firm under Hyman, is embarking on what it describes as a \"renewal programme\". The UK and Europe division is to be split in two, with one section to focus on the \"UK government customers\" and the other on activities in the wider public sector. Three new non-executive directors are to be appointed along with a new general counsel. A board committee for corporate responsibility is also to be created. Despite Hyman's rapid departure, Lyons paid tribute to the outgoing boss: \"As CEO since 2002, he has taken Serco from a predominantly UK business with a turnover of \u00a31.3bn to the \u00a35bn international services business it is today. He leaves with our very best wishes.\" Brought up in apartheid Durban, Hyman is a Pentecostal Christian and was one of only a few non-white students at his university. He has previously told the Guardian that he donates a biblical tithe \u2013 or 10% of his annual income \u2013 to his local Pentecostal church in Surrey and fasts every Tuesday, as he has done every week of his life. He worked for Arthur Anderson and Ernst &amp; Young before joining Serco in 1994. Andre Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School, said Hyman may have become a scapegoat. \"Typically, CEOs at companies that face a scandal are often pushed out to clear the air.

But in some cases it can be a fatal distraction where companies feel they have addressed the big issues by changing the leader.\"",

    "webTitle": "UK's economic growth prompts foretaste of election battle", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's strongest growth in more than three years has provided a foretaste of the looming general election battle as the Conservatives and Labour clashed over the state of the economy. David Cameron and George Osborne seized on a second successive set of strong growth figures which showed that expansion in all four sectors of the economy produced a 0.8% jump in national output. The chancellor said the UK was \"on the path to prosperity\". Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said the pickup was long overdue and was \"no recovery at all\" for the millions of people seeing prices rise faster than wages. The political battle over growth was prompted by official figures registering the fastest pace of expansion since the spring of 2010, the period just before and after the last general election. Output grew by 1.5% in the latest 12 months, but remains 2.5% below the peak reached in early 2008, before the most severe recession of the post-war era. In the subsequent 18 months, gross domestic product fell by 7.2% and the stop-start recovery that followed has been the slowest of modern times. The quarterly growth figure was in line with City forecasts and analysts believe the economy will continue to expand in 2014. Most are expecting national output to increase by about 1.5% in 2013 and 2.5% next year. Cameron and Osborne took to Twitter to hail the performance of the economy. \"Today's encouraging GDP growth figures are another sign we are turning a corner,\" said the prime minister, while the chancellor added: \"This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity.\" Liberal Democrat members of the coalition were more cautious. Vince Cable, the business secretary, said more needed to be done to address the lack of bank lending to business. \"We've always said the road to recovery would be a marathon, not a sprint,\" he said. Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, said he could understand why people did not feel the economy was getting stronger. Speaking on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show, Clegg said: \"For many people this doesn't feel like a recovery until they feel actually they have got more money in their pocket and they don't feel under so much pressure from the bills they have to pay every week and every month.\" Recent announcements of hefty increases in energy bills have led to renewed fears about the impact of rising prices on living standards, and Balls said that working people were on average \u00a31,500 worse off since the coalition came to power three years ago. \"After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages this is no recovery at all.\" The shadow chancellor said that on the cost of living, growth and reducing the UK's budget deficit, the government had failed every test it had set itself since 2010. John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. Our own surveys have consistently shown that businesses are confident and recent economic data has been positive, so we have much to be optimistic about. But we are still behind a number of advanced economies such as the US and Germany that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. \"Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great. Businesses are in desperate need of better access to finance, and trade promotion has to be prioritised so that firms who are looking to do business overseas are able to take that first step towards exporting.\" Frances O'Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \"It's good that growth is back, but the real test for the government is whether the proceeds will be fairly shared and used to tackle the living standards crisis. If the recovery only flows to the better-off residents of London and the south-east then today's news will make little difference to most people.\" Agriculture, industrial production, services and construction all recorded growth in the third quarter, the ONS said. The service sector \u2013 which accounts for almost 78% of the economy \u2013 has now more than made up the ground lost during the slump of 2008-09, while construction and industrial production are 12% down on their pre-recession levels. Where GDP growth is coming from Services: Growth rate: 0.7% Services make up three-quarters of the UK economy. Spending in shops, restaurants and hotels in the most recent three months was espcially strong, up 1.8% on the quarter. Construction: Growth rate: 2.5% Construction was badly hit by the recession of 2008-09 and even after the latest rise, helped by an increase in housebuilding, remains more than 12% below its previous peak. Agriculture: Growth rate: 1.4% Farmers appear to have had a better growing season than they might have expected during the unusually long, cold winter, but it's a tiny sector with a negligible impact on growth. Production: Growth rate: 0.5% A robust expansion in manufacturing, of 0.9%, was partly offset by an unusually sharp, 6.8% decline in electricity and gas supply, probably due to the mild late summer weather.",

      "bodyText": "Scotland's Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemicals plant was saved along with 1,370 jobs on Friday after the Unite trade union gave in to the demands of its billionaire owner. After two days of intense negotiation and frantic lobbying from the Scottish and Westminster governments, Jim Ratcliffe, the Swiss-based majority owner of Ineos, reversed his decision to shut the petrochemicals site. The closure would have resulted in 800 redundancies, put the adjoining refinery in jeopardy and caused severe damage to the economy of central Scotland. Grangemouth employs 1,370 full-time staff and around 2,000 contractors, and supporting hundreds of local businesses. Workers punched the air and phoned their families as they streamed out of Friday morning's meeting, in which Grangemouth boss Calum MacLean announced Ratcliffe's about-turn. Ineos will now pump investment into a gas terminal that will receive cheap imported shale gas from the US. Duncan Smith, an employee at the refinery, said: \"It's great news for everybody in petrochemicals, but it's great news for the refinery too because we'd have had to look out for our jobs as well. We were all very worried about what the decision would be and when we heard the news there was a big cheer.\" On Thursday, Unite accepted Ineos's \"survival plan\", which demanded an end to workers' final salary pensions, job cuts, a wage freeze and harsher redundancy terms. Only two days before, the union had declared victory over Ineos when the majority of its members voted against the company's proposals. Ratcliffe then dropped his bombshell and ordered the permanent closure of the petrochemicals plant, which was shut down along with the refinery on Wednesday as the dispute escalated. Workers at the refinery knew that without its sister operation their jobs were also on the line and they told Unite to reverse its position. On top of the Ineos plan, Unite agreed not to strike at Grangemouth for three years while management restores the loss-making plant to profit. Ineos said the plant was losing \u00a310m a month and that for the company to make \u00a3300m of required investment its workers had to forfeit their pensions, which it said cost an extra 65p for every pound paid in salary. Despite the agreement, tensions still simmered between Ineos and the union. Unite had rejected Ineos's claims that Grangemouth made a loss and accused Ratcliffe of using scare tactics to strip workers of their long-established working terms. MacLean accused Unite of misleading its members. \"If the union had taken the position they took in the last two days a week ago we might never have come to this and all this stress wouldn't have happened,\" he said. Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: \"Decent men and women are being asked to make sacrifices to hold on to their jobs, but the clear wish of our members is that we work with the company to implement its proposals. Grangemouth's importance spreads far beyond the Forth Valley where the town's 18,000 population live. It is Scotland's biggest industrial site and supplies plastics to car plants and other manufacturers throughout the UK. It is also a totemic symbol as Scotland prepares for next year's referendum on independence. Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, has stressed the country's economic strength as he has campaigned to split from the UK. Salmond described the announcement as a \"tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster\". There was also relief in Westminster, where there had been concerns that the loss of a huge manufacturing plant could have pushed other companies that rely on Grangemouth out of the UK. MacLean said Ratcliffe had spoken several times to Salmond and ministers in London as he debated whether to stick by Grangemouth. Ineos also asked for assurances that its application for a \u00a39m grant from the Scottish government and a \u00a3150m UK loan guarantee were on track. MacLean said: \"Our concern was that after recent events there would still be a commitment from the [Scottish] government. I was worried that the government needed to realise they were putting money into an asset that had a long-term future and that if there was lots of industrial action going on they might not have seen things that way.\" Local traders expressed relief that the plant, with its well-paid workers and huge needs for support and maintenance, would be saved. Ami Carson, who works at the Rumbling Tum food van, where Grangemouth workers queue for burgers and rolls, said: \"It's great for us. Now we don't have to be worried about our business not being as busy. I'm really happy for the boys keeping their jobs. Everybody will be in great spirits.\" Nawaz Haq, who bought the lease to the Grange Lea Hotel to cater for Grangemouth contract workers, said: \"Grangemouth isn't a tourist town and there's not a lot of other business so I was extremely anxious that I had invested in a project that would leave me indebted for a number of years.\" Gary Horne, who runs the local Abbotsinch pub and restaurant, said: \"If they had closed, the local economy would have been devastated. We'll be full tonight.\" The dispute between Unite and Ineos was complicated by the position of Stephen Deans, a union official and longstanding Grangemouth employee who was accused and cleared of working to rig the vote for the local parliamentary candidate. Ineos has conducted its own investigation into Deans's party activity on Ineos premises and its findings were due to be released on Friday, but MacLean said Deans had \"asked for a few days\".",

Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As if often happens with durable goods orders statistics, the picture behind headline figures is actually very different from what it looks at the first glance. This time around, the massive increase headline orders is only due to rising transport orders over the month (massive 57.5% upswing in nondefense aircraft orders). Elsewhere, the picture is clearly less upbeat.</p> <p>Today's orders data is another indicator that - in our view - will convince [Federal Reserve] members to keep policy on hold in the coming months as risks for the economy are still skewed to the downside and the manufacturing cycle doesn't seem to have gained any momentum at the end of the third quarter.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-25T14:24:06.495Z\">at 3.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-526a6678e4b04921a1f0c38e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-25T12:52:54.756Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And here's the response from Labour. </strong>Shadow Scottish secretary Margaret Curran said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People across Scotland will be relieved that a deal has been struck, and the men and women who work at Grangemouth will return to work.</p> <p>This plant is of vital importance to Scotland's economy and it is right that it will not stand idle any longer.</p> <p>An important contribution to this was the UK and Scottish governments working together.

But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages this is no recovery at all.</p> <p>&#xa0;Working people are on average over \u00a31500 a year worse off since David Cameron came to office, yet very high earners have enjoyed a huge tax cut. And on the cost of living, growth and the deficit, this Government have failed every test they set themselves in 2010.</p> <p>&#xa0;We now need action to secure a strong, balanced and sustainable recovery that works for the many, not just a few at the top. And simply to catch up all the lost ground since 2010 we would need 1.5 per cent growth in every quarter between now and the election.</p> <p>&#xa0;Labour will help people facing a cost of living crisis by freezing energy prices until January 2017 and expanding free childcare for working parents. And we have called for a tax cut for 24 million working people on middle and lower incomes by introducing a lower 10p starting rate of tax.</p> <p>&#xa0;We need a recovery that's built to last, so we must also bring forward infrastructure investment now to build thousands of affordable homes.

My colleague Sean Farrell's latest story on Grangemouth will be on the site shortly, but here's a flavour: Scotland\u2019s Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemicals plant was saved along with 1,370 jobs yesterday after the Unite trade union caved in to the demands of its billionaire owner. After two days of intense negotiation and frantic lobbying from the Scottish and Westminster governments, Jim Ratcliffe, the Swiss-based majority owner of Ineos, reversed his decision to shut the petrochemicals site. The closure would have resulted in 800 redundancies, put the adjoining refinery in jeopardy and caused severe damage to the economy of central Scotland. Grangemouth employs 1,370 full-time staff and about 2,000 contractors, as well as supporting hundreds of local businesses. Workers punched the air and phoned their families as they streamed out of Friday morning\u2019s meeting, where Grangemouth boss Calum MacLean announced Ratcliffe\u2019s about-turn. Ineos will now pump investment into a gas terminal that will receive cheap imported shale gas from the US. Duncan Smith, an employee at the refinery, said: \u201cWe were all very worried about what the decision would be and when we heard the news there was a big cheer.\u201d On Thursday, Unite accepted Ineos\u2019s \u201csurvival plan\u201d which demanded an end to workers\u2019 final salary pensions, job cuts, a wage freeze and harsher redundancy terms. Ineos chairman Jim Ratcliffe said he wants a long-term future for the Grangemouth plant. He told BBC News: Unions do have a proper role in negotiating for employees and advising employees but they have to engage with the employer. What we want to see is a long term future for Grangemouth. More data from the US, with consumer confidence dropping in October to its lowest level since the end of last year, perhaps not surprising given the government shutdown and the impasse over the debt ceiling going to the wire. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final reading of its sentiment index fell to 73.2 from 77.5 in September, and compared to an inital estimate of 75.2. This was the lowest final reading since December 2012. Survey director Richard Curtins said: When asked to describe in their own words what they had heard about recent economic developments, the number of consumers that negatively mentioned the federal goverment in October was the highest in the more than half-century history of the survey. In the US, orders for durable goods - long lasting manufactured items ranging from toasters to tanks - rose 3.7% in September. This was better than expected but was mainly due to a surge in aircraft orders. Without that, new orders fell 0.1%, suggesting businesses might have held back spending because of the recent budget dispute and government shutdown. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: As if often happens with durable goods orders statistics, the picture behind headline figures is actually very different from what it looks at the first glance. This time around, the massive increase headline orders is only due to rising transport orders over the month (massive 57.5% upswing in nondefense aircraft orders). Elsewhere, the picture is clearly less upbeat. Today's orders data is another indicator that - in our view - will convince [Federal Reserve] members to keep policy on hold in the coming months as risks for the economy are still skewed to the downside and the manufacturing cycle doesn't seem to have gained any momentum at the end of the third quarter. And here's the response from Labour. Shadow Scottish secretary Margaret Curran said: People across Scotland will be relieved that a deal has been struck, and the men and women who work at Grangemouth will return to work. This plant is of vital importance to Scotland's economy and it is right that it will not stand idle any longer. An important contribution to this was the UK and Scottish governments working together. I am glad that we put party politics aside to find a solution to this crisis. Caroline Flint, shadow energy and climate change secretary, called for a review of UK refining: We welcome the announcement that Grangemouth petrochemical plant and refinery are to re-open. Grangemouth is a vitally important part of our energy infrastructure, and this news will be welcome not just to the staff who work there but to people across Scotland, Northern Ireland and the North of England who rely on it for a secure supply of fuel. For the future the Government should honour its commitment to undertake a review of UK refining capacity. More reaction to the decision by Ineos not to close the Grangemouth petrochemicals plant, from Sean Farrell at the site: Duncan Smith, who works in the refinery and is an Ineos permanent employee, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great news for everybody in petrochemicals. But it\u2019s great news for the refinery too, because the refinery would have been in a much worse position and we\u2019d have had to look out for our jobs as well. It was a very interesting week with lots of twists and turns. \"At the meeting we were all very worried about what the decision would be and when we heard, there was a big cheer. If Ineos puts the \u00a3300m in it means we can complete the gas terminal and that will secure jobs and work for the next 20 or 25 years. There are people who have families and the would have had to find a new job instantly. Places like restaurants, shops and other small suppliers rely on Grangemouth. If oil or petrochemicals closed they would lose their businesses.\u201d An unnamed power station worker said: \u201cIt\u2019s good for the country and it\u2019s good for everyone. An awful lot of people will be very pleased their jobs will be coming back because they said the contract staff will be reemployed. \"I think both sides could have handled it a wee bit better. They put people through things they didn\u2019t have to. You can\u2019t just say everything will blow over and this will be OK because the contractors have already lost an awful lot.\u201d Here's our story on the resignation of Christopher Hyman from Serco: Serco, the services company facing an investigation into its government contracts, has begun an urgent search for a new chief executive after Chris Hyman quit in a desperate attempt to rebuild the company's reputation. After allegations that Serco overcharged the government for electronic tagging of offenders, the operator of hospitals, prisons and railways around the world needs to improve its relationship with the UK government, which provides 25% of its revenue. Hyman, who is leaving after 20 years with the firm and 10 years as chief executive, said: \"At this time, nothing is more important to me than rebuilding the relationship with our UK government customer. In recent weeks it has become clear to me that the best way for the company to move forward is for me to step back.\" The company, chaired by Alastair Lyons, said a new chief executive would be appointed from outside the group but in the interim named Ed Casey, head of the Americas division since 2005, to take the helm. Less than 24 hours earlier rival G4S, also caught up in the controversial electronic tagging fiasco, parted company with the head of its UK and Irish operations Richard Morris. The G4S chief executive, Nick Buckles, left in May. Last month Serco was put on notice it could be investigated by the Serious Fraud Office after charging the government for tagging criminals who were either dead, still in prison or who had never been tagged in the first place. More from Jill Treanor here. Our datablog on GDP since 1955 has been updated with today's figures. Following the GDP figures, my colleague Heather Stewart wonders whether Britain really has turned the corner. Here's a flavour of her full piece: Experts \u2013 not least at the Bank of England \u2013 are divided about whether the current uptick is sustainable. For the optimists, whose case was spelled out recently in a speech by external monetary policy committee member (and reformed dove) David Miles, the economy could be in the early stages of what will become a \"self-sustaining\" recovery. It goes something like this: rising house prices and the generally sunnier mood of Britain's consumers boosts firms' expectations of future demand; they invest more; that creates more jobs and drives up real wages \u2013 and the economy as a whole is given a leg-up into what economists like to call a good equilibrium. There's another story too, though: the drastic improvement in growth over the past 12 months has been achieved against the background of rapidly rising consumer borrowing on credit cards, overdrafts and payday loans and, as the latest batch of energy price rises shows, there is little sign of the squeeze on living costs abating. There must be a risk that we are experiencing precisely the \"debt-fuelled growth\" the chancellor until recently claimed to abhor. Back with the UK GDP figures, here's a video of Joe Grice, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics, announcing details of the data. Away from Grangemouth, another outsourcing group has seen its boss depart amid the continuing investigation into government electronic tagging contracts. After G4S announced the departure of UK boss Richard Morris last night, rival Serco said its chief executive Christopher Hyman had resigned. The departures came as the companies were facing claims they were charging for tagging criminals who had died, were still in prison or had never been tagged. Hyman said: I have always put the interests of Serco first. At this time, nothing is more important to me than rebuilding the relationship with our UK government customer. In recent weeks it has become clear to me that the best way for the company to move forward is for me to step back. I have been fortunate enough to have had the privilege of working at a great company with extremely talented people. I wish everyone at Serco the very best for the future. Here's a quick summary of the day so far: \u2022 Grangemouth\u2019s owners told the plant\u2019s workers that the decision to close the petrochemicals factory had been reversed and that the whole site had been saved. \u2022 The deal between the owners Ineos and the Unite union includes a three year no strike agreement \u2022 UK GDP rose by 0.8% in the third quarter, in line with forecasts \u2022 Coalition welcomes growth news... \u2022...but Labour says workers are not feeling it in their pay packets More reaction to the Grangemouth news (via PA). Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said: This is the news that we all wanted. The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time. They have been through a hell of a week and I hope they have a much better weekend as a result of today's announcement. They can look to the future with an optimism which was absent earlier in the week. This is the outcome we have worked towards and one which Scotland and Grangemouth deserve. There are undoubtedly lessons to be learned from this dispute but for now we should focus on the immediate success of securing the site's future. The joint talks at Ineos yesterday have been just one part of the UK Government's efforts to find a solution to this crisis. The UK guarantee for the new ethane facility is an important part of the discussions and the plant will be a key part of the company's plans for the future. Pictures of happy, relieved staff at Grangemouth are arriving -- such a change from the sad scenes on Wednesday when workers were told the petrochemical plant was being shut down: And on that note, I'm handing over to Nick Fletcher. Gordon Grant, a site manager at Grangemouth, confirms that the union have agreed to a \"three year no-strike agreement\". This is because \"We will still be a loss making business till we get to the point where we have an ethane tank and we are able to import from the US.\" (via Sean Farrell) Ineos has also announced what the Unite union has signed up to: No strikes for three years Move to a modern pension scheme Pay freeze for three years Changes to union agreements on site including no full time union convenors Unite has also issued a statement, saying today's news is \"tinged with sadness\" because workers at Grangemouth will have to make sacrifices to hold onto their jobs. Pat Rafferty, Unite Scottish secretary said: This decision is clearly very welcome. Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and \u00a3300m will be invested into the plant. Grangemouth is the powerhouse of the Scottish economy - it now has a fighting chance of upholding this crucial role into the future. Obviously today's news is tinged with sadness - decent men and women are being asked to make sacrifices to hold onto their jobs, but the clear wish of our members is that we work with the company to implement its proposals. Unite has worked tirelessly to save Grangemouth because we are totally committed to this plant and its incredible workforce. We will now sit down with Ineos to consult on the company's proposals. Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire founder of Ineos, has declared that Grangemouth now has a \"great future\", and taken a swipe at the Unite union for initially opposing the survival plan. In a statement, Ratcliffe said: This is a victory for common sense. The Unite Union advised employees to reject change and vote for closure. Thank goodness people finally came to their senses. Grangemouth now has a great future. Craig Martin, the leader of Falkirk Council, says it is \"great news...fantastic news\" not just for Grangemouth itself but for Scotland. From Grangemouth, Sean Farrell writes: Grangemouth\u2019s owners told the plant\u2019s workers on Friday that the decision to close the petrochemicals factory had been reversed and that the whole site had been saved. The decision follows a dramatic climbdown by the Unite trade union on Thursday. The union accepted drastic cuts to employees working conditions after Ineos owner Jim Ratcliffe ordered the petrochemicals site\u2019s closure. Calum MacLean, Ineos Grangemouth\u2019s chairman said: We are happy to announce that following a meeting with shareholders yesterday that Grangemouth petrochemicals will remain open. That decision has been reversed. MacLean said Unite had not made any further concessions and that the union had accepted Ineos\u2019s \"survival plan\" for the site which employs 1,370 permanent workers and 2,000 contractors. He said Ratcliffe had several conversations with Scottish first minister Alex Salmond and UK ministers and Ineos would now make the \u00a3300m investment to secure Grangemouth\u2019s long term future. MacLean also denies that Ineos held its workforce, and beyond, to ransom. What about contractors? Calum MacLean says that projects at Grangemouth that were stopped this week will now recommence. That must be good news for contract workers who were laid off this week. Will the unions have to deliver a public apology to Jim Ratcliffe, Ineos's biggest shareholder? No, replies Calum MacLean. The most important thing for Ineos is telling staff the good news, and getting the plant running again. From the scene, my colleague Sean Farrell flags up that the union has agreed not to hold any strike action while the consultation process over Grangemouth's restructuring takes place. The next step is for all sides to work together to implement the survival plan for Grangemouth, Calum MacLean says. The key development is that Ineos's shareholders have accepted the Unite union's offer yesterday to fully support this plan. He's taking questions from the media: Will there still be job losses? MacLean says that Ineos will not dismiss the idea that there could be some job losses. However, having secured the investment that the plant needs, any redundancies will be limited. MacLean explains that Grangemouth get back to full operations as soon as possible. Calum MacLean says that staff at Grangemouth gave a loud cheer when they heard that the petrochemical plant will not be shut. The Petrochemicals plant at Grangemouth is being saved, announces Calum MacLean, the Grangemouth Petrochemicals chairman. MacLean is telling the media now that he's very pleased to announce that the petrochemicals plant will remain open.... the decision to shut it will be reversed. Breaking -- an announcement about to be made at Grangemouth on the future of its refinery and petrochemical plant..... There's the usual mix of reaction on Twitter. Here's some of the best: Back to the UK growth data, and economics editor Larry Elliott writes: Britain's economy is growing at its fastest rate in more than three years after a 0.8% increase in national output in the quarter to September. The first stab at estimating the state of the economy from the Office for National Statistics found that activity had increased across the board with production, construction, services and agriculture all registering growth. Despite the expansion \u2013 the second strong quarterly performance in a row \u2013 the level of gross domestic product remains 2.5% lower than it was when Britain's deepest post-war recession began at the start of 2008. The ONS said that national output had grown by 1.5% between the third quarter of 2012, when the economy was boosted by the London Olympics and Paralympics, and the third quarter of 2013. Output increased by 1.4% in agriculture, 0.5% in production, 2.5% in construction and 0.7% in services. The data is likely to be revised as more detailed information about the economy becomes available. Here's Larry's full news story: UK economy grows by 0.8% \u2013 the fastest pace in three years From Grangemouth, our correspondent Sean Farrell reports that workers are walking across the site to an 11am meeting to hear their fate..... Breaking away from the economic news - we're expecting to hear an announcement on the future of the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemicals plant soon. The news could come at 11am. Nothing is official yet, but there are reports from Scotland that the petrochemical plant could be spared. Here's Sky's News take: Petrochemical plant Grangemouth looks set to be saved following a last-minute deal, Sky News understands. Workers at the plant in Scotland are to be told of the breakthrough at 11am, Sky sources said. Earlier, the Unite union confirmed it would now \"embrace\" a survival plan at the plant in an effort to reverse a decision by the owner to close the business. The move was announced following talks between union officials and management at Ineos. Rebecca Gray of the Evening Times also believes a deal has been agreed.... No political or economic event is complete without at least one reference to hard-working people. Nick Clegg, deputy prime minister, says that his priority is to get more money into their pockets: Clegg said: Today\u2019s GDP figures are encouraging and show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery. This Government has set Britain on the right course, helping to create 1.4 million new private sector jobs. We must continue to work hard to build a stronger economy and do it fairly, with investment in jobs and measures such as the increased personal tax allowance putting more money in the pockets of hard-working people. Neil Prothero, UK Analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, also warns that the recovery remains shaky: Prospects for a sustainable pick-up are still far from assured given ongoing headwinds to growth. The process of private-sector balance-sheet adjustment has further to run, while established trade links with Europe remain depressed by the still weak outlook for the euro zone. Without a turnaround in business investment and a recovery in real incomes, UK growth will remain worryingly reliant (as in the past) on debt-driven consumption and leveraged expansion of financial services and property. Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank warns that much of Britain's growth comes from consumers and credit rather than the fabled export-led March of the Makers (as the bar chart at 10.11am shows) He writes: This is not a balanced recovery yet. It is consumption led, as cheap financing encourages consumers into the shops, car showrooms and estate agents. The housing market is surging, retail sales rose at their strongest rate for five years in Q3 and car sales were up more than 10% yoy in September. Just one number summarises all that: the household saving rate fell 1.5 percentage points in the year to Q2 and will probably have fallen further in Q3 as well. Services and construction accounted for the lion\u2019s share (0.7ppts) of growth in the third quarter. Manufacturing rose on the back of the domestic strength, as yesterday\u2019s CBI survey showed. Goods exports have been weak in the third quarter. It would be better if this was an exports and investment driven recovery, but consumption led growth is OK for now. Ed Balls MP, Labour's Shadow Chancellor, has welcomed the news that the UK economy grew by 0.8% -- before pointing out that many workers aren't feeling it in their pay packets. Here's his statement: After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages this is no recovery at all. Working people are on average over \u00a31500 a year worse off since David Cameron came to office, yet very high earners have enjoyed a huge tax cut. And on the cost of living, growth and the deficit, this Government have failed every test they set themselves in 2010. We now need action to secure a strong, balanced and sustainable recovery that works for the many, not just a few at the top. And simply to catch up all the lost ground since 2010 we would need 1.5 per cent growth in every quarter between now and the election. Labour will help people facing a cost of living crisis by freezing energy prices until January 2017 and expanding free childcare for working parents. And we have called for a tax cut for 24 million working people on middle and lower incomes by introducing a lower 10p starting rate of tax. We need a recovery that's built to last, so we must also bring forward infrastructure investment now to build thousands of affordable homes. And we need to make long-term changes so that our economy works for working people. That's why Labour will cut business rates for small firms, reform our banks, strengthen the minimum wage and introduce a compulsory jobs guarantee for the long-term unemployed. But David Cameron and George Osborne oppose all these measures. Despite the damage of the last three years and the growing cost of living crisis on their watch, they are still making the wrong calls and failing the British people. More detail from the ONS press conference, from Phillip Inman: Speaking to a packed room of reporters, Joe Grice agreed that we have now had two quarters of growth showing an annualised rate of around 3%, which is well above the 2.5% average before the crash. And this chart shows how the four sectors of the UK economy all expanded, contributing to the overall 0.8% rise in GDP: have fared over the last 10 years; Output increased by 1.4% in agriculture, 0.5% in production, 2.5% in construction, and 0.7% in services. So although construction grew fastest, Britain's dominant service sector provided the bulk of the actual rise in output. This chart shows how the four sectors have fared over the last 10 years. This chart of economic growth over the last decade confirms that the 0.8% rise in GDP is the strongest reading since April-June 2010. It also underlines how much damage the UK suffered in 2008 and 2009, and how it has struggled since. Economics correspondent Phillip Inman reports that the Office for National Statistics believes the economy strengthened through the quarter, and didn't fade away in September. Today's reading could be revised higher once more data comes in. From the press conference, Phillip tells me: ONS chief economist Joe Grice said the trajectory for GDP growth remained upwards and preliminary figures for September show the recovery continuing to strengthen. The ONS has only a smattering of data for September and bases most of its third quarter figure on data from July and August. With a margin for error of 0.2% in the overall GDP estimate, there is the possibility that once all the September data is available GDP will have grown by nearer 1% in Q3. A recovery in oil and gas production in September could also boost the final estimate after it dragged the preliminary figure down by an estimates 0.1 percentage points, though the mild weather since July, when production fell sharply, is likely to offset a recovery in this vital sector. The official statement is online here. More optimism from the government. Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, says Britain is on its way back, with growth across the economy: Larry Elliott, our economics editor, flags up that economists called today's numbers correctly: Growth in the third quarter provisionally estimated at 0.8% - smack in line with City expectations. Fastest rate of expansion in the economy for more than three years. George Osborne tweets that \"Britain's hard work is paying off\", following the news that the UK economy grew by the fastest rate since the second quarter of 2010. Despite the 0.8% growth achieved in the last quarter, Britain's economy is still 2.5% smaller than before the last recession struck in 2008. The Service sector has now recovered all the activity lost since the financial crisis began, says Joe Grice of the ONS. Other sectors are still lagging behind, though. The UK service sector grew by 0.7% during the quarter, up from 0.6% in the second quarter of 2013. Industrial output was less strong, growing by 0.5% -- that's slower than the 0.8% growth in in Q2. Construction led the way, with growth of 2.5% quarter-on-quarter. That's up from 1.9% in Q2. The 0.8% rise in GDP in the last three months means the UK economy posted its strongest growth since the second quarter of 2010. That will certainly please the UK Treasury. On a year-on-year basis, the UK economy is 1.5% larger than a year ago. All four sections of the UK economy grew in the last three months, the ONS says. BREAKING: The UK economy grew by 0.8% in the third quarter of the year. That's in line with the forecasts Here we go.... reminder, economists expect that GDP rose by 0.8% in the third quarter.... Just five minutes to go until we hear how the UK economy performed in the third quarter of this year. The news will be announced at 9.30am exactly, at a press conference in London. It should be carried live on Sky News and BBC News 24. Joe Grice, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics, will announce the details and then take questions from the media. Duncan Weldon, the TUC's senior economist (and no fan of George Osborne's economic policies) reckons the UK economy grew by 0.9% in the last quarter.... Worrying economic signals from Germany -- business morale has fallen for the first time in six months, suggesting that the eurozone's powerhouse may be feeling an autumn chill. The Munich-based Ifo think tank just reported its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of 7,000 firms, fell to 107.4, from 107.7% in September. Economists had expected a rise to 108.0. Sky News also flags up that City economists are pretty upbeat: Investec's Philip Shaw forecasts 0.8% growth for the third quarter but said it was \"not impossible\" that it could be closer to 1%. Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics added: \"GDP looks on track to have grown at a healthy rate.\" Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, predicts that UK GDP rose by a punchy 0.9%. At one stage, he was plumping for a 1.1% rise -- before manufacturing and construction firms reported that September was slightly tougher than August. Cook explains: Survey data from the 3 month period was strong \u2013 there is no doubting that \u2013 with PMI releases hitting multi-year highs across the services and manufacturing sectors and a decent rise in the construction measure too. Office of National Statistics output figures, the GDP compilers, have been less encouraging towards the end of the quarter with manufacturing and construction output slipping back. This stymied our desire to predict a figure of 1.1% growth on the quarter but we remain above consensus at 0.9% \u2013 consensus remains at 0.8% \u2013 and 1.6% growth on the year. Economists also predict that today's data will show the UK economy is 1.5% larger than a year ago. Over the previous three quarters the UK economy: shrank by 0.3% between October and December grew by 0.4% between January and March grew by 0.7% between April and June The London stock market is calm ahead of the UK GDP data (due in just over 30 minutes time) , with the blue-chip FTSE 100 index down just 4 points. The pound is gaining a little ground, up a fifth of a cent against the US dollar at $1.6222. Talk of Britain's economic recovery gathering pace must sound hollow in Grangemouth this morning. Workers at the huge oil refinery and petrochemicals plant are waiting to learn if the site's owner, Ineos, will reverse plans to shut it. Reuters is reporting that the Unite union have offered a two-year 'no strike' pledge. That's part of a bid to persuade Ineos's billionaire owner, Jim Ratcliffe, that they've fully embraced his survival plan: The union at Scotland's Grangemouth refinery has offered a two-year no-strike deal in a bid to persuade its owners not to close the site, local Member of Parliament Michael Connarty told Reuters on Friday. Ineos, which has said it will close a petrochemical plant on the same site and has threatened to close the 210,000-barrel-per-day refinery, is expected to make a statement soon about whether it has accepted the union's offer to go along with a survival plan. Economists expect a strong GDP reading today, of around +0.8%, because UK companies reported a surge in activity during the summer. Surveys of manufacturers, service providers and construction firms all showed a jump in output. August was the best month for Britain's manufacturers in almost 20 years, according to data provider Markit . A 0.8% rise in GDP would mean growth had accelerated from the second quarter, when the economy grew by 0.7%. Earlier this week, my colleague Aditya Chakrabortty exposed the full extent to which the recovery is focused in London and the South East of England, with high earners also outpacing the rest of the population. Here's the full piece: London's economic boom leaves rest of Britain behind He wrote: During the boom from 1997 to 2006, London and the south-east was responsible for 37% of the UK's growth in output. Since the crash of 2007, however, their share has rocketed to 48%. Every other nation and region \u2013 with the exception of Scotland \u2013 has suffered relative decline over the same period. The upshot is about a quarter of the population is responsible for half of the UK's growth, leaving the remaining three-quarters of Britons to share the rest. The research also shows that the UK's highest-earners have become relatively more prosperous after the crash, while many on middle incomes are being squeezed hard. In austerity Britain, the top 20% of earning households are enjoying 37.5% of all Britain's income growth, even after accounting for taxes and benefits. And here's a second piece, digging into how the UK capital has led the recovery: Two-speed Britain: is the recovery restricted to London? We shouldn't get too carried away by one quarter's decent-looking growth, cautions Andrew Sentance, a former Bank of England policymaker this morning. Sentance, who's now senior economic advisor at PricewaterhouseCoopers, points out that UK economic growth has been patchy for several years. He told Bloomberg TV: The reality is we've had an on-off recovery since 2009, and it's gone in waves.... The underlying rate of growth is not that strong. However, Sentance added that he believes the UK could achieve 2.5% growth during 2014, which would be a welcome (and long-awaited) return to trend growth. Another factor to watch this morning is whether all four parts of the UK economy managed to grow in July-September. That's Services, Production and Manufacturing, Construction and Agriculture. The quartet all posted growth in the second quarter of 2013, for the first time since 2010. A strong GDP reading this morning will also raise the pressure on the Bank of England over when it should raise UK interest rates. Many City traders doubt governor Mark Carney's prediction that the economy won't be strong enough to support higher borrowing costs until 2016. Last night, Carney told journalists that the Bank remains cautious, saying: The message to households, to businesses, is that the recovery has obviously begun, it is strengthening, but we are not going to withdraw monetary stimulus until it\u2019s really gained that traction. Good morning. Is Britain's economy gathering pace? We're about to find out, with the release of the first estimate of UK economic data for the third quarter of 2013. Britain's statistics body, the Office for National Statistics, will announce its provisional estimate for UK GDP at 9.30am BST. Economists expect to hear that the British economy grew at a pretty decent pace between July and September. The consensus in the City is that GDP probably increased by 0.8% in the third quarter, which would be the fastest growth since the second quarter of 2010. Some experts believe growth could have hit 1%. If so, expect to hear the government declare that the economic recovery is on track. However, the data should also raise fresh questions about the breadth and balance of the recovery, with wages still lagging behind inflation. We'll also be watching events up at the Grangemouth oil refinery again, where workers are waiting to hear whether the decision to shut the petrochemicals arm will be reversed. Yesterday the Unite union declared it would support the cost-cutting survival plan. The owners, Ineos, should give a response today... We'll track other important developments across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world too, but the GDP data is going to be the main focus this morning....",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares hit a five month high this week on a host of positive economic news and growing hopes that the US Federal Reserve will keep the money taps switched on. The FTSE 100 finished at 6721.34 on Friday, up 8.16 points on the day and just shy of 100 points on the week, its best level since 28 May. At the start of the week came the US non-farm payroll figures, delayed because of the now-resolved government shutdown. They proved worse than expected, showing a 148,000 rise in jobs in September rather than the forecast 180,000 increase. But analysts said the data meant the Fed, whose next policy meeting starts on Tuesday, was unlikely to begin easing its $85bn a month bond buying programme this year. An early snapshot of Chinese manufacturing for October was better than expected, although some of the shine was taken off by concerns about a growing credit crunch in the county. On Friday came positive UK GDP figures showing a 0.8% rise in the third quarter, which added to the positive sentiment. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Risk appetite remained supported by the US fiscal resolution (albeit short term, be prepared for a re-run), a welcome rebound in China PMI manufacturing, continued recovery for UK GDP and - as strange as it sounds - the fallout from the government shutdown. Lost jobs, output and skewed data is likely to force the US Federal Reserve to delay plans to taper its QE3 stimulus programme until 2014 meaning continued easy monetary policy for longer. Reckitt Benckiser was in focus as it announced a strategic review of its pharmaceuticals business, best known for its Suboxone heroin addiction treatment. Analysts suggested the review could lead to a sale of the division, which they calculated could be worth up to \u00a35.5bn. Reckitt rose as high as \u00a348.05 before slipping 25p on Friday to \u00a347.80, still nearly \u00a33 up on the week. Unilever confirmed its warning in September of a slowdown in emerging markets, reporting a 3.2% rise in third quarter sales, down from 5% in the previous three months. Its shares slipped 16p to \u00a324.93. Vague bid talk surrounded RSA Insurance, up 0.4p to 126.8p, as well as British Land, 5p better at 628p. A number of retail bosses decided to cash in after reporting strong sales growth. Sports Direct International founder Mike Ashley sold \u00a3106m worth of shares in the company at 662.5p each, while Asos chief executive Nick Robertson raised around \u00a380m and finance director Nicholas Beighton \u00a312m from disposing of share options. Robertson reportedly paid \u00a32.8m of his gains to Asos staff as bonuses. Sports Direct shares edged up 3p to 688p yesterday and Asos added 152p to \u00a352.57. Two outsourcing groups caught up in an investigation into some of their government contracts both announced executive changes. Serco said chief executive Chris Hyman was resigning, and its shares added 5p to 557.5p. G4S rose 5.5p to 258.5p as UK chief executive Richard Morris became the latest to leave. HSBC analysts raised their rating from underweight to neutral and their target price from 205p to 250p, saying: Business fundamentals remain challenging in Europe and may precipitate a weak close to 2013. However, hopes that value can be unlocked through breakups and a rejuvenated strategy are likely to buoy G4S' stock through what is perceived as a rump of difficult trading. Banks had a volatile week, following concerns about a credit crunch in China and tougher than expected stress tests from the European Central Bank. But they recovered by the end of the week, with Royal Bank of Scotland 11.9p better at 368.4p on talk that Morgan Stanley had been appointed to lead a flotation of its US business Citizens. Lloyds Banking Group added 0.25p to 80.37p after confirmation it was in talks to sell its Scottish Widows Investment Partnership to Aberdeen Asset Management, up 8.7p to 459.1p, for up to \u00a3500m. Aberdeen plans to issue shares to Lloyds as part of the deal, giving the state owned bank a stake in the fund management group. Miners benefited from the positive manufacturing figures from China, a key consumer of commodities. BHP Billiton was 3p better at \u00a319.53p while precious metal specialist Fresnillo rose 15p to \u00a310.37 after it announced a $165m payout to shareholders on Thursday. As the US reporting season continued, Microsoft impressed with a better than expected 17% surge in third quarter profits, while Amazon also beat forecasts. Apple's week was dominated by two i's - the launch of its latest iPads and news that billionaire investor Carl Icahn called on the company to use its cash to buy back $150bn worth of shares. Apple shares slipped nearly 5% in early trading on Friday, ahead of results next week. Arm, the Cambridge-based chip designer which is one of Apple's key suppliers, failed to benefit from the iPad launch. Its shares recovered 22.5p to 983p but still ended 31p lower on the week as analysts fretted about a slowdown in royalty revenues, as revealed by the company's third quarter figures. Royal Mail shares hit a new closing high of 555p, up 26p as one of the earliest City brokers to suggest it was undervalued has upped its valuation. Panmure Gordon's Gert Zonneveld said a week before the flotation that the business could be worth \u00a33.7bn to \u00a34.5bn, compared to the sale price of \u00a33.3bn. Now Zonneveld has issued a note putting a 570p target on the business, valuing it at \u00a35.7bn. The news comes a day after it emerged JP Morgan told ministers before the sell-off that Royal Mail could be worth \u00a310bn, and in the same week hedge fund TCI became the company's second biggest shareholder behind the UK government. Singapore's sovereign wealth fund emerged with a 4.1% stake. Associated British Foods, the sugar to Primark business, added 28p to \u00a321.33 as Morgan Stanley raised its price target from \u00a321.40 to \u00a322.65 with an overweight recommendation: Negative market trends have heaped pressure on sugar. However, with most of the bad news now absorbed, we expect Primark to become the key driver of the ABF story. This should narrow the valuation gap with EU clothes retailers and help the stock to re-rate. BSkyB was in demand for much of the week as it continued to shrug off challenges from rivals, but then suffered profit taking and fell 21.5p to 928.5p. City analysts continued to debate whether Vodafone, down 2.15p at 226.75p, could receive a bid from AT&amp;T once the deal to sell its stake in its US wireless joint venture to partner Verizon is complete. Credit Suisse was the latest, saying a bid of up to \u00a380bn would be needed to convince Vodafone to sell. The bank said: We raise our price target to 245p [from 195p] per share to reflect increased forecasts and an assumed 50% probability of a bid from AT&amp;T. We calculate that Vodafone could increase its own value in a defence scenario by leveraging up more than the 0.7 times debt/EBITDA Vodafone is currently targeting. AT&amp;T would then have to bid up to \u00a380bn to overcome Vodafone's potential scepticism of the deal synergies and the impact of free cash flow/share dilution on the value of AT&amp;T shares received. However, we note that such a bid could put AT&amp;T's own dividend cover at risk \u2013 a possible red line for the company \u2013 particularly if its US mobile growth stalls next year. We also see little logic to AT&amp;T in such a footprint deal, with few if any synergies, no big change in EU spectrum regulation coming and leaving Vodafone exposed to the same 4play problem it has today. So despite the repeated comments by AT&amp;T (widely reported by Reuters and others in recent weeks) that it is interested in buying large European mobile assets, we place only a 50% probability of an AT&amp;T bid for the Vodafone stub happening. With downside to 210p if no bid, and a 50% probability of upside to 280p per share if AT&amp;T does bid, we raise our target price to the midpoint 245p, supported by our increased forecasts. Finally TalkTalk Telecom fell 1.3p to 264.4p as analysts at Berenberg issued a sell note but pointed out a forgotten contract which could prove valuable to the company. The bank said: Back in May 2012, TalkTalk and Fujitsu won the wholesale contract for the Post Office from BT Wholesale. Some had estimated this five-year contract to be worth as much as \u00a3500m, with TalkTalk providing the broadband/telephony access. Since 2012, though, there has been little talk regarding this contract. On further investigation, we believe this contract could be significant. The Post Office does not provide any specific figures regarding its customer numbers, but having called its call centre, it became clear to us that it has over 500,000 subscribers \u2013 making it the largest ISP after Everything Everywhere. If we assume TalkTalk takes 70% of the \u00a3100m a year contract value, this .. could imply an incremental \u00a317.5m of earnings per year. This is worth an incremental 20p to the TalkTalk share price and drives our increased discounted cash flow-driven valuation to 195p. This does not affect our fundamental longer-term thesis that both BT Sport and fibre will have a negative impact on the fundamentals of TalkTalk's business. However, despite the migration process for the Post Office contract starting at the end of the second quarter, nothing has been flagged ahead of the quarter.",

This should narrow the valuation gap with EU clothes retailers and help the stock to re-rate.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>BSkyB</strong> was in demand for much of the week as it continued to shrug off challenges from rivals, but then suffered profit taking and fell 21.5p to 928.5p.</p> <p>City analysts continued to debate whether <strong>Vodafone</strong>, down 2.15p at 226.75p, could receive a bid from AT&amp;T once the deal to sell its stake in its US wireless joint venture to partner Verizon is complete. Credit Suisse was the latest, saying a bid of up to \u00a380bn would be needed to convince Vodafone to sell. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> <p>We raise our price target to 245p [from 195p] per share to reflect increased forecasts and an assumed 50% probability of a bid from AT&amp;T.</p> <p>We calculate that Vodafone could increase its own value in a defence scenario by leveraging up more than the 0.7 times debt/EBITDA Vodafone is currently targeting. AT&amp;T would then have to bid up to \u00a380bn to overcome Vodafone's potential scepticism of the deal synergies and the impact of free cash flow/share dilution on the value of AT&amp;T shares received.</p> <p>However, we note that such a bid could put AT&amp;T's own dividend cover at risk \u2013 a possible red line for the company \u2013 particularly if its US mobile growth stalls next year. We also see little logic to AT&amp;T in such a footprint deal, with few if any synergies, no big change in EU spectrum regulation coming and leaving Vodafone exposed to the same 4play problem it has today. So despite the repeated comments by AT&amp;T (widely reported by Reuters and others in recent weeks) that it is interested in buying large European mobile assets, we place only a 50% probability of an AT&amp;T bid for the Vodafone stub happening.</p> <p>With downside to 210p if no bid, and a 50% probability of upside to 280p per share if AT&amp;T does bid, we raise our target price to the midpoint 245p, supported by our increased forecasts.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally <strong>TalkTalk Telecom</strong> fell 1.3p to 264.4p as analysts at Berenberg issued a sell note but pointed out a forgotten contract which could prove valuable to the company. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Back in May 2012, TalkTalk and Fujitsu won the wholesale contract for the Post Office from BT Wholesale. Some had estimated this five-year contract to be worth as much as \u00a3500m, with TalkTalk providing the broadband/telephony access. Since 2012, though, there has been little talk regarding this contract. On further investigation, we believe this contract could be significant.</p> <p>The Post Office does not provide any specific figures regarding its customer numbers, but having called its call centre, it became clear to us that it has over 500,000 subscribers \u2013 making it the largest ISP after Everything Everywhere. If we assume TalkTalk takes 70% of the \u00a3100m a year contract value, this .. could imply an incremental \u00a317.5m of earnings per year. This is worth an incremental 20p to the TalkTalk share price and drives our increased discounted cash flow-driven valuation to 195p.</p> <p>This does not affect our fundamental longer-term thesis that both BT Sport and fibre will have a negative impact on the fundamentals of TalkTalk's business. However, despite the migration process for the Post Office contract starting at the end of the second quarter, nothing has been flagged ahead of the quarter.</p> </blockquote>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair has followed up its pledge to \"not unnecessarily piss people off\" by cutting some of its most excessive charges, including baggage fees and penalties for not printing a boarding pass. The first concrete measures announced since chief executive Michael O'Leary made a Damascene conversion to better customer service will also include more tolerance of minor booking errors, fewer irritating announcements onboard and allowing passengers a second small piece of hand luggage with them on the plane. Ryanair said that, after extensive customer feedback on its website, it would introduce several improvements over the next six months. Customers will soon be able to search for flights online without having to enter security codes, and will have 24 hours' grace to correct minor errors, such as spellings of names and routings, in bookings. On early morning and late evening flights, the airline will make only safety announcements, rather than the current barrage of sales pitches and marketing, and dim the cabin lights. From December, boarding card reissue fees will be cut from \u20ac70 or \u00a370 to \u20ac15 or \u00a315, although only for customers who have already checked in online. Those who forget will still pay the standard fine. In January, airport bag fees for luggage put in the hold will be halved to \u20ac30 or \u00a330 at the bag drop desk. O'Leary, who this week overcame his previous disdain for social media to engage directly with customers on Twitter, said: \"As we implement our plans to grow from 80 million to over 110 million customers per annum over the next five years, we are actively listening and responding to our customers.\" He put that philosophy into practice to mixed effect on Friday afternoon in his second foray on to Twitter, where despite his recent pledge to tone down the Irish airline's \"macho\" image, he informed customers that he kept fit via \"Tantric sex. Works for Sting \u2026 n' me!\", repeatedly plugged the airline's calendar featuring undressed female cabin crew and eventually signed off saying it was time for \"3pm cocktails, dancing girls\". Ryanair's customer service director, Caroline Green, said: \"As some of these policy changes will require website changes and staff retraining, we will be rolling them out over the next few months as we strive to further improve Europe's No 1 customer service airline.\" She added that if customers should make had other suggestions and feedback on the changes by going, they should make them online. This represented a significant change from previous attitudes to online customer feedback, when a customer who created a Facebook page to protest at spending hundreds of euros for her family's boarding passes to be reissued was derided as \"so stupid\" by O'Leary for her \"fuck-up\". However, O'Leary's belief that all publicity was good publicity appeared to be shaken by shareholders at the airline's annual meeting in September who told him that the negative image needed to be addressed \u2013 underlined by news that day that Ryanair had forced a doctor to pay in full to change to an earlier flight home after his family were killed in a fire. Since then, O'Leary has employed the word \"sorry\" surprisingly frequently. He told the Guardian this week that there was \"a mistaken belief that I'm a tough guy. I'm like a little caramel crisp\".",

But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages this is no recovery at all. Working people are on average over \u00a31,500 a year worse off since David Cameron came to office, yet very high earners have enjoyed a huge tax cut. And on the cost of living, growth and the deficit, this government has failed every test they set themselves in 2010. We now need action to secure a strong, balanced and sustainable recovery that works for the many, not just a few at the top. And simply to catch up all the lost ground since 2010 we would need 1.5% growth in every quarter between now and the election.</p> <h2>Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors</h2> <p>The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. We should expect wage growth to pick up as a result of higher output and productivity, further helping the recovery. However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. Furthermore, Help to Buy will push up house prices and while this might generate a feel good factor, it is storing up problems for the future.</p> <p>By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet instead of long and strong.</p> <h2>John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses</h2> <p>The latest GDP figures back up the positive mood small firms reported to the FSB in our latest small business index, which showed increased confidence and aspirations to create jobs. For the third quarter in a row, the growth has come from all sectors, which points to a rebalancing economy and should make for a more stable recovery. Our own figures show confidence rising across UK regions and this must be built upon ... While growth is above the level reported before the UK dipped into a second recession, these figures are still some way below the pre-recession peak and the Chancellor must not be complacent.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight </h2> <p>The GDP data are very encouraging, not only showing the growth rate picking up further to 0.8% quarter-on-quarter but also showing decent positive contributions from all output sectors. While the dominant services sector remains very much key to the economy's performance, it is important that manufacturing and construction achieve healthy expansion as well if sustainable robust growth is to occur. It needs to be remembered that the improved growth is coming from a low base as GDP in the third quarter was still 2.5 % below the peak level seen in the first quarter of 2011.</p> <p>Any change in interest rates is clearly a long way off whether or not unemployment ends up falling more rapidly than the Bank of England currently expects. The Bank of England has made it clear that given the past extended weakness of the economy and the low base that growth is coming from, it wants to give the economy every chance to develop sustained, decent expansion.</p> <h2>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First</h2> <p>Hopes for broad-based growth in Q3 have so far been realised although, naturally, a heavy part relies on the services sector. Construction was higher by 2.5%, agriculture by 1.4% and services pumped out the best number since Q3 of last year \u2013 the quarter that benefited from the Olympics. Of that services growth, a lot seems to correlate with recent surveys; business-to-business companies and those who are able to take advantage of the recent expansion of housing market exuberance are the main beneficiaries. The consumer facing side of the industry \u2013 the high street \u2013 is not keeping pace.</p> <p>The falls in real incomes have been highlighted by high street stalwarts in recent weeks and will likely depress output moving through Q4; I believe today's figure will be the 'high-water mark' for the UK economy for now. Growth will continue but these rates are, at this point in time, unsustainable.</p> <h2>Andrew Hunter, co-founder of Adzuna jobs website</h2> <p>UK employment levels point towards a sustained economic recovery, with the number of advertised job vacancies hitting a two-year high last month. The situation for jobseekers has improved significantly, with employers showing renewed confidence and investing in staff to meet growing demand. However, scratch beneath the surface, and the picture becomes less clear. Despite a nominal monthly increase, in real terms the average pay packet has fallen by \u00a31,020 in a year, as the cost of inflation continues to burn a hole in the nation's pockets. There are also huge regional disparities in the economic race. Since the crash, London and the south east has been driving in a different gear to the rest of the country, and the gap is widening. During the pre-crash boom years, London and the south east was responsible for 37% of the UK's growth output \u2013 but since the 2007 crash, this figure has rocketed to 48%. This is reflected in the jobs market \u2013 our data reveals that nine of the top ten cities to find a job were in London and the South of England. Meanwhile, seven of the worst 10 cities to find a job were in the north of England. So while the situation for many is improving, the UK economy is quickly heading towards a two-tier race.</p>",

For the third quarter in a row, the growth has come from all sectors, which points to a rebalancing economy and should make for a more stable recovery. Our own figures show confidence rising across UK regions and this must be built upon ... While growth is above the level reported before the UK dipped into a second recession, these figures are still some way below the pre-recession peak and the Chancellor must not be complacent. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight The GDP data are very encouraging, not only showing the growth rate picking up further to 0.8% quarter-on-quarter but also showing decent positive contributions from all output sectors. While the dominant services sector remains very much key to the economy's performance, it is important that manufacturing and construction achieve healthy expansion as well if sustainable robust growth is to occur. It needs to be remembered that the improved growth is coming from a low base as GDP in the third quarter was still 2.5 % below the peak level seen in the first quarter of 2011. Any change in interest rates is clearly a long way off whether or not unemployment ends up falling more rapidly than the Bank of England currently expects. The Bank of England has made it clear that given the past extended weakness of the economy and the low base that growth is coming from, it wants to give the economy every chance to develop sustained, decent expansion. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First Hopes for broad-based growth in Q3 have so far been realised although, naturally, a heavy part relies on the services sector. Construction was higher by 2.5%, agriculture by 1.4% and services pumped out the best number since Q3 of last year \u2013 the quarter that benefited from the Olympics. Of that services growth, a lot seems to correlate with recent surveys; business-to-business companies and those who are able to take advantage of the recent expansion of housing market exuberance are the main beneficiaries. The consumer facing side of the industry \u2013 the high street \u2013 is not keeping pace. The falls in real incomes have been highlighted by high street stalwarts in recent weeks and will likely depress output moving through Q4; I believe today's figure will be the 'high-water mark' for the UK economy for now. Growth will continue but these rates are, at this point in time, unsustainable. Andrew Hunter, co-founder of Adzuna jobs website UK employment levels point towards a sustained economic recovery, with the number of advertised job vacancies hitting a two-year high last month. The situation for jobseekers has improved significantly, with employers showing renewed confidence and investing in staff to meet growing demand. However, scratch beneath the surface, and the picture becomes less clear. Despite a nominal monthly increase, in real terms the average pay packet has fallen by \u00a31,020 in a year, as the cost of inflation continues to burn a hole in the nation's pockets. There are also huge regional disparities in the economic race. Since the crash, London and the south east has been driving in a different gear to the rest of the country, and the gap is widening. During the pre-crash boom years, London and the south east was responsible for 37% of the UK's growth output \u2013 but since the 2007 crash, this figure has rocketed to 48%. This is reflected in the jobs market \u2013 our data reveals that nine of the top ten cities to find a job were in London and the South of England. Meanwhile, seven of the worst 10 cities to find a job were in the north of England. So while the situation for many is improving, the UK economy is quickly heading towards a two-tier race.",

It's increasingly hard to argue with George Osborne's claim that the economy has \"turned a corner\". However, the experts \u2013 not least at the Bank of England \u2013 are divided about whether the current uptick is sustainable. For the optimists, whose case was spelled out recently in a speech by external monetary policy committee member (and reformed dove) David Miles, the economy could be in the early stages of what will become a \"self-sustaining\" recovery. It goes something like this: rising house prices and the generally sunnier mood of Britain's consumers boosts firms' expectations of future demand; they invest more; that creates more jobs and drives up real wages \u2013 and the economy as a whole is given a leg-up into what economists like to call a good equilibrium. There's another story too, though: the drastic improvement in growth over the past 12 months has been achieved against the background of rapidly rising consumer borrowing on credit cards, overdrafts and payday loans and, as the latest batch of energy price rises shows, there is little sign of the squeeze on living costs abating. There must be a risk that we are experiencing precisely the \"debt-fuelled growth\" the chancellor until recently claimed to abhor. Manufacturers are doing what they can \u2013 the sector has now expanded by 0.9% in two successive quarters \u2013 but they're coming from a low base, and recent analysis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggested that growth is almost all accounted for by our thriving carmakers. With lending to small and medium-sized firms still falling, it's hard to see industry managing to achieve the drastic shift that would be needed if it were to become a major driver of the economy. Industrial production \u2013 which includes the energy and mining sectors, as well as manufacturing \u2013 contributed 0.06% of the 0.8% quarterly increase in output; services \u2013 including hotels, shops, restaurants and the financial sector, for which the new Bank governor, Mark Carney, has made himself a cheerleader \u2013 accounted for 0.57%. We won't know until the ONS releases more detailed estimates of GDP how much of that has been driven by consumer spending; but maxing out the credit card or dipping into the rainy day fund can only get you so far, and the recovery will peter out unless inflation abates (unlikely in the short term) or households manage to boost their earnings to keep up.
