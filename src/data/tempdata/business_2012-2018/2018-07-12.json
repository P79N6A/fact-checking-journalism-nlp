      "bodyText": "The US justice department announced on Thursday that it will appeal against a federal judge\u2019s decision to allow AT&amp;T\u2019s landmark takeover of Time Warner. Last month, in a stinging rebuke to the Trump administration, district judge Richard Leon threw out the government\u2019s objections to the merger and warned the department not to appeal against his decision. AT&amp;T\u2019s $81bn takeover of Time Warner, the owner of CNN and HBO among other high-profile assets, has become a political lightning rod after Donald Trump criticized the deal and said it \u201cwas not good for the country\u201d. But in June Leon ruled that the government\u2019s objections \u201crested on improper notions\u201d and warned against an appeal. \u201cI hope the government has the wisdom and courage\u201d not to seek a stay, he said. Leon rejected all of the government\u2019s arguments against the deal, one of the largest media mergers ever. On Thursday, AT&amp;T said: \u201cThe court\u2019s decision could hardly have been more thorough, fact-based and well researched.\u201d It said it was \u201csurprised\u201d by the government\u2019s decision and \u201cready to defend the court\u2019s decision\u201d. Media commentators suggested Trump was critical of the deal because of his antipathy for CNN, which has lambasted his presidency and is a regular target for his Twitter attacks. Trump has praised Rupert Murdoch\u2019s decision to pursue a merger with Walt Disney, calling Murdoch to tell him \u201cthat this could be a great thing for jobs,\u201d according to the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders. Asked about CNN\u2019s potential role in the merger\u2019s difficulties, AT&amp;T\u2019s chief executive officer, Randall Stephenson, said: \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t know. But nobody should be surprised that the question keeps coming up.\u201d The case was further politicized after it emerged that AT&amp;T had paid Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen $600,000 in consultancy fees as it attempted to woo the White House. Stephenson said the hiring had been \u201ca big mistake\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Walmart has patented surveillance technology that would allow it to spy on employees\u2019 conversations with customers and use the audio to measure workplace performance. The patent for \u201csound sensors\u201d that could be installed at checkout is the latest example of controversial workplace surveillance technology and automated systems that purport to quantify and increase employees\u2019 productivity. The filing comes at a time in which the US retail giant is facing growing competition from Amazon, which completed a $14bn acquisition of Whole Foods last year. The patent filed this week described a system of sensors \u201cdistributed throughout at least a portion of a shopping facility\u201d. Audio of both workers and customers could potentially be used to determine \u201cif employees are performing their jobs efficiently and correctly\u201d and aid in increased \u201ccost savings\u201d and \u201cguest satisfaction\u201d, the document said. Walmart said in a statement that the patent is a \u201cconcept that would help us gather metrics and improve the checkout process by listening to sounds produced by the bags, carts and cash registers and not intended for any other use\u201d, adding: \u201cWe file patents frequently but that doesn\u2019t mean the patents will actually be implemented. We\u2019re always thinking about new concepts and ways that will help us further enhance how we serve customers.\u201d The system, the filing said, could record \u201cbeeps\u201d on the scanner to measure the number of items purchased; the \u201crustling of bags\u201d to determine the number used; the sounds of \u201cguests talking while waiting in line\u201d to measure the length of the wait; and the \u201caudio of conversations between guests and an employee\u201d to gauge whether workers were greeting guests. In recent years, there have been escalating concerns about employers monitoring workers, with critics questioning the effectiveness of this technology. Some research has suggested that excessive monitoring could lead to decreased efficiency, as BuzzFeed reported. There have also been growing criticisms about the surveillance leading to potential privacy and labor rights\u2019 violations. Walmart has long faced criticisms over its treatment of employees, including complaints about wages, working conditions, anti-union tactics and discrimination. Walmart has been under increasing pressure to slash prices following Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has come under pressure to revamp its apprenticeship scheme after figures showed the number of training places slumped by a third over the last nine months. In the first three terms of the 2017-18 academic year, the number of people starting an apprenticeship fell to 290,500, a 34% reduction on the 440,300 during the same nine-month period in the previous year. It is also nearly 25% down on the 384,500 apprenticeships started in the equivalent period in 2015-16. The figures are a blow to the education secretary, Damian Hinds, who in his short time in office has emphasised the need for students to acquire workplace skills. Opposition MPs and business bodies said much of the blame for the collapse in apprenticeships could be put on a \u00a33bn apprenticeship levy brought in last April, which they said was overly bureaucratic and failed to accommodate the needs of businesses. Gordon Marsden, the shadow minister for higher and further education, said the government was \u201cignoring the widespread concerns about apprenticeships\u201d that had meant figures for new starts falling in every month since April 2017. \u201cLabour, businesses, and providers have called for an urgent reassessment of the process but ministers have buried their heads in the sand. Their refusal to review the levy is now causing major damage to the apprenticeship brand,\u201d Marsden said. Edwin Morgan, the director of policy at the Institute of Directors, said the figures \u201cdo not make for pleasant reading\u201d and that, on the current trajectory, it would not be possible for the government to meet its target of 3m apprenticeship starts by 2020. Businesses have complained that the levy is payable even when staff are away on secondment or attending course at suppliers. Firms pay the levy up front and claim it back when they employ apprentices. Morgan said: \u201cFrom the beginning, businesses have raised valid concerns around the complexity and rigidity of the system. Improving skills is a leading concern for our members. It\u2019s now time for government to rethink the approach and work with businesses to turn the levy from a drag on apprenticeships into a system that delivers the right skills in the right places.\u201d The apprenticeships and skills minister, Anne Milton, admitted there was a decrease in the overall number of people starting apprenticeships but said there had been a 1,000% increase in the number of \u201chigher-quality\u201d apprenticeships. She said: \u201cThere are also tens of thousands more people starting on higher-level apprenticeships, which are available in a range of cutting-edge industries, and more people achieving their apprenticeships.\u201d Businesses complained before the levy was introduced that it was cumbersome, especially for small and medium-sized firms, and was being implemented too quickly. Many only had a few months to put in place the scheme once ministers agreed on the finer details. Karen Jones, the group HR director at the housebuilder Redrow, said critics should take into consideration that the results would be skewed by the surge in starts last April before the levy was introduced. \u201cHowever, this is not to say that barriers do not persist.,\u201d she said. \u201cApprenticeship uptake among lower-income and disadvantaged backgrounds is still too low and reducing the financial burden for young people and their families by ensuring that they do not lose their child benefit would be a good way to better the situation.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The number of first-time buyers rose in May while the number taking on new buy-to-let mortgages fell, in a sign that government policies and tax changes are rebalancing the housing market. There were 32,200 new mortgages completed for first-time buyers over the month, 8.1% more than in May last year. The \u00a35.4bn of new lending was up 12.5%, according to figures from UK Finance, a lobby group for the financial services industry. The average first-time buyer in the UK is 30, has a gross household income of \u00a342,000 and takes on a loan of \u00a3142,452 at a loan to value of 85%. Government schemes such as help-to-buy and shared ownership have helped some people get on the property ladder who would have otherwise been unable to afford to. However, the number of new buy-to-let mortgages fell by 9.8% in May compared with a year earlier to 5,500. Lending was \u00a3700m, 22% lower than in the same month last year. \u201cThe mortgage market is seeing a pre-summer boost, driven by a rise in the number of first-time buyers and strong remortgaging activity,\u201d Jackie Bennett, the director of mortgages at UK Finance, said. \u201cMeanwhile, purchases in the buy-to-let market continue to be constrained by recent regulatory and tax changes, the full impact of which have yet to be fully felt.\u201d The figures suggest changes to stamp duty introduced by the government in April 2016 are cooling on the buy-to-let market. Anyone buying a second home for any reason now has to pay a higher rate of stamp duty than someone buying a property that will be their main home. Despite the rise in first-time buyers in May, Bennett said some potential buyers were still struggling to get on to the property ladder. \u201cAffordability remains a challenge for some prospective buyers and this is reflected by a gradual increase in loan to income multiples,\u201d she said. The number of people moving home also increased in May, with 31,100 new home-mover mortgages completed, up 4.4% compared with a year earlier. The average home mover is 39, has a gross household income of \u00a355,000 and a loan to value of 73.6%, according to UK Finance. Jonathan Samuels, the chief executive of the property lender Octane Capital, said May\u2019s lending data was a \u201cperfect snapshot\u201d of the changes to the UK housing market in recent years. \u201cFirst-time buyers are in the ascendancy while amateur landlords are beating a fast retreat. What activity there is within buy-to-let is primarily the remortgaging of existing portfolios or properties in order to maintain some kind of margin. \u201cWhile professional landlords and institutional investors remain active, amateur landlords are fast becoming an anachronism.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The European commission has cut its growth forecasts for the UK and Europe this year, blaming the threat of a trade war with the US, which it warned would produce \u201cno winners, only casualties\u201d. Britain will slump to the bottom of the EU league table for growth in 2018, the commission said, as it is \u201cparticularly exposed\u201d to an escalation of trade tensions and while Brexit uncertainty persists. Growth in the EU is now expected to be 2.1% in 2018, compared with 2.3% in the commission\u2019s spring forecast and 2.4% in 2017. Its forecast for growth in 2019 was unchanged at 2%. Explaining the weaker outlook for growth this year, the commission said rising trade tensions with the US were dampening confidence and would limit economic expansion. Pierre Moscovici, European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, taxation and customs, said growth might turn out lower than the forecasts should tensions escalate further. \u201cThe slight downward revision compared to the spring reflects the impact on confidence of trade tensions and policy uncertainty, as well as rising energy prices. \u201cOur forecast is for a continued expansion in 2018 and 2019, although a further escalation of protectionist measures is a clear downside risk. Trade wars produce no winners, only casualties.\u201d The EU downgraded its forecast for UK growth in 2018 to 1.3% from an earlier forecast of 1.5%. That puts Britain joint bottom of the EU league table with Italy. The commission expects UK growth to drop to 1.2% in 2019, unchanged from its spring forecast. Only growth in Italy is expected to be weaker, at 1.1%. Growth forecasts were downgraded for all major economies in the EU in 2018. The German economy is expected to grow by 1.9% this year, down from the spring forecast of 2.3%. The growth forecast for France was cut to 1.7% from 2%, and to 2.8% from 2.9% for Spain. The commission said there were a number of risks facing the UK economy, such as weak consumer confidence and business investment as uncertainty over the future trading relationship with the EU remained. It said risks to the 2018 forecast were tilted to the downside. \u201cDomestically, downside risks relate to the possibility that the household saving rate rises faster than anticipated, leading to lower consumption growth. \u201cWhile on the external side, as an open economy, the UK is particularly exposed to an escalation in trade protectionist measures that could further inhibit export growth.\u201d The commission\u2019s forecast for UK growth in 2019 was based on the assumption of the status quo in terms of trading relations between the EU and the UK, in the absence of detail on what the relationship would look like. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Among EU countries in 2017, Germany was the biggest exporter of goods to the US, followed by the UK, Italy, France and Ireland. Donald Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imported from the EU, citing \u201cnational security\u201d reasons. In retaliation, the EU has announced tariffs on a wide variety of imported US products, including whiskey, Levi\u2019s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. In response, the US president threatened to impose 20% tariffs on cars imported from Europe, which would be particularly damaging for the German automotive industry. The commission warned an escalation of trade tension would disrupt the current \u201cupswing\u201d in the global economy and trigger bouts of financial market volatility. It said other risks to economic growth in Europe included political uncertainty in a number of EU countries, such as the outcome of Brexit negotiations, as well as political tensions outside Europe.",

      "bodyText": "Can it be only 19 months since outside shareholders in Sky were supposed to be grateful for a bid from the Murdochs at \u00a310.75 a share? It is. In December 2016, the independent directors, led by Martin Gilbert, declared they had given \u201cfull consideration to the fundamental value and prospects\u201d for Sky and, while they remained supremely confident in those prospects, \u00a310.75 in cash was too good to miss. Offers at almost 40% above the previous week\u2019s share price don\u2019t come along often, ran their argument. And, hey, with 21st Century Fox sitting on a 39% stake, Rupert could have cut up rough by offering a 20% premium in an attempt to crawl to a position of majority control. As argued here at the time, Gilbert &amp; co\u2019s position looked too feeble. Sky\u2019s shares had traded at \u00a311 in April 2016 and had only fallen to 769p because, at the time, the market was in a panic about Netflix and even thought BT represented a serious threat on the football front. Brexit blues may also have infected the mood. Sky executives, by contrast, were bullish. In July they had raised the dividend for the 12th year in a row and they spoke of big opportunities ahead as the freshly absorbed Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland were brought up to the standard of the UK original. Even while the independent directors were pondering, Polo Tang at UBS, one of the City\u2019s sharpest media watchers, reckoned a fair price for Sky was \u00a313.70. Now, with the political and regulatory wrangling complete, the real bidding for Sky has started and the best offer has shot to \u00a314.75, Comcast\u2019s response on Wednesday evening to Fox\u2019s morning pitch at \u00a314. This hotly contested auction \u2013 who knows? \u2013 may bring more excitement. One could try to defend the Sky independents\u2019 capitulation in 2016 on the grounds that a lot has happened since. The company netted the next set of Premier League rights on decent terms, which wasn\u2019t guaranteed. The passage of time, with Sky ticking along nicely, has also added to the company\u2019s value. The board was also dealing with a single bidder in 2016 since Comcast hadn\u2019t declared its interest. And, at a push, one could say that Sky\u2019s scarcity value, as one of the few TV companies with a substantial pan-European presence, has increased as US media titans follow Netflix and look global. All the same, Gilbert and his colleagues should be embarrassed. Valuation is art, not science but the difference between \u00a310.75 and \u00a314.75 is enormous. In hard cash terms for 100% of Sky, it\u2019s about \u00a37bn, which is serious money. Angry Sky shareholders said in December 2016 that their board had rolled over too cheaply. They were right. Unilever shareholders rightly concerned Finally a few Unilever shareholders are stirring themselves to protest about the company\u2019s plan to unwind its ancient Anglo-Dutch corporate structure and establish its sole headquarters and primary market listing in the Netherlands, a move that would almost certainly mean ejection from the FTSE 100 index. Unilever is pursuing its big switch in the name of \u201csimplification\u201d, which is understandable from its point of view: the current dual-headed arrangement could indeed get in the way of doing equity-based deals. The trouble is, life could become more complicated for those funds that have strict UK investment mandates. For them, the fact that Unilever will still have a listing in London is irrelevant. It\u2019s the presence in the indices that matters. Nick Train of fund manager Lindsell Train, which manages a 2.5% stake in Unilever, told the FT he is worried about the \u201clikelihood that we will become forced sellers of the shares for some of our clients at a time and a price not of our choosing.\u201d. He is surely not alone in that fear, since UK tracker funds, in theory, are most exposed to the risk of being forced to dump a major stock at a temporarily depressed price. Yet Columbia Threadneedle is the only other major fund manager to speak up. Others need to realise they have some clout here. Unilever\u2019s board requires a 75% majority in the current UK class of shares to win the day in the autumn vote, which is a tall order if the refuseniks organise themselves. Train urges those UK investors to \u201cgive serious consideration over the summer as to whether this proposal is in their interest\u201d. So they should. Whatever Unilever says about \u201cengaging\u201d with UK shareholders, it seems to have listened to the worries and decided to ignore them.",

      "bodyText": "Fitch could also downgrade some US companies if they are hurt by the trade dispute with China. It already has a negative outlook on the Alabama State Port Authority, due to \u201cuncertainty over trade policy\u201d, and the likely impact on revenues. Fitch explains: The largest portion of the port\u2019s trade value with China is made up of wood pulp and other agricultural products, but it is also exposed more broadly to the metallurgical coal and steel markets. The port has relatively high exposure to commodities, particularly coal and steel, which comprise over 50% of revenues and nearly 50% of overall tonnage. Ratings agency Fitch has identified the US states most vulnerable to a trade war with China. Fitch says that Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and Indiana all exported more than $1.2bn of plant products, such as soybeans, to China in 2016. However, plant-based exports to China made up a bigger percentage of the state economies of South Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska. Fitch explains: Exports to China make up more than 20% of the total agricultural output in both South and North Dakota and in excess of 10% in Iowa and Nebraska. While Illinois is the largest producer of soybeans in the US, the state is likely to be less affected by a fall in demand for US soybeans due to its more diversified, larger economy. Total plant product exports to China as a percentage of the economy of Illinois was less than 1% 2016. Global stock markets are recovering from yesterday\u2019s selloff, despite anxiety over a US-China trade war. In London, the FTSE 100 is up 50 points, or 0.66%, at 7642. The French CAC is 0.7% higher while Germany\u2019s DAX has gained 0.3%. That follows a stronger day in China, where the Shanghai market clawed back yesterday\u2019s losses. This positive mood has extended to Wall Street, where the Dow has jumped over 100 points in early trading. Artjom Hatsaturjants, Research Analyst at Accendo Markets says: The FTSE has staged a strong rebound, retracing nearly all of yesterday\u2019s sell-off. All the while Donald Trump continues to play the disruptive \u2018cat\u2019 amongst the rest of NATO \u2018pigeon\u2019 allies. Sentiment improved despite continued uncertainty on whether US and China still have each other in trade cross-hairs, or if negotiators are ready to sit down again. US washing machine prices have surged by over 13% in the last year, in another sign that protectionism can drive up the cost of living. Donald Trump imposed new tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels in January, saying he wanted to protect US jobs. But today\u2019s inflation report shows that the move has hit shoppers in the pocket. Core US inflation (stripping out volatile factors) also rose last month, from 2.2% to 2.3%. Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics predicts it will keep rising, especially if new levies are imposed on Chinese imports (as tariffs are paid by consumers, not producers). with the labour market exceptionally tight and activity expanding strongly, we think that core inflation has further to rise. The prospect of further tariffs on Chinese imports will only add to that upward pressure. The US economy is heating up, says James Knightley of ING, and that makes future interest rate rises more likely. Here\u2019s his take on the jump in American inflation to 2.9% last month. The US has an economy that probably grew 4% in the second quarter, has an inflation rate rapidly heading to 3% at the same time as arguably experiencing the strongest labour market for 50 years. This suggests that even with the uncertainty generated by trade protectionism the Federal Reserve should continue tightening monetary policy \u201cgradually\u201d. This is certainly the line that we expect the Federal Reserve\u2019s semi-annual monetary policy report to take on Friday. We continue to look for two further rate rises this year \u2013 one in 3Q and one in 4Q18. The jump in US inflation to 2.9% means that American real wages are falling. Average earnings only rose by 2.7% in June, last week\u2019s jobs report showed. That means that pay isn\u2019t keeping pace with rising prices. Economist Joseph Brusuelas thinks a trade war would make that situation even worse: Newsflash: America\u2019s inflation rate has struck a six-year high, as US citizens are hit by higher prices in the shops. The US Consumer Price Index rose by 2.9% in June, compared to a year earlier. That\u2019s te highest rate since 2012. On a monthly basis, prices rose by just 0.1% compared to May, compared to 0.2% a month ago. Fuel prices rose by 0.2% in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says, driven by pricier dairy, cereal, fruit and vegetable products Gasoline prices rose by 0.5%, and housing costs were 0.1% higher. The tariffs outlined by America yesterday would push up the cost of many food products and consumer goods from China, potentially pushing inflation up. The European Central Bank is worried that the increase in trade protectionism in recent months is hurting the European economy. The minutes of the ECB\u2019s last meeting, just released, show that policymakers believe that trade tensions have become a greater threat,. They cite Donald Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium from Europe, and the threat of tariffs on car imports. The minutes say: While the expected upward impact of fiscal stimulus in the United States remained in place, geopolitical risks had not abated and trade tensions were considered to have become more likely. In particular, concerns were expressed about the possibility that such tensions could lead to a more general decline in confidence throughout the global economy, beyond any direct effects from the imposition of tariffs. Against this background, the balance of risks to the global economic expansion continued to be assessed as tilted to the downside. The ECB points out that a trade war can affect the economy in various ways. 1) Tariffs and trade barriers can drive up prices, fuelling inflation 2) Protection leads to falling exports, which hurts economic confidence and weakens demand. The ECB adds: In this context, risks associated with heightened volatility in global financial markets were also highlighted more broadly. Newsflash: The UK government has given Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox the green light for its attempted takeover of Sky. This clears the way for a proper takeover battle between 21CF (which raised its offer to \u00a314 per Sky share yesterday) and US media group Comcast (which hit back with a \u00a314.75 per share bid last night). Sky shares have risen today, to \u00a315.37 each, showing that the City expects another bid.... Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President for the Euro, says Europe needs to protect itself against the threat of a global trade war: \u201cEuropean economic activity remains solid with 2.1% GDP growth forecast for the euro area and the EU28 this year. Nevertheless, the downward revision of GDP growth since May shows that an unfavourable external environment, such as growing trade tensions with the US, can dampen confidence and take a toll on economic expansion. The growing external risks are yet another reminder of the need to strengthen the resilience of our individual economies and the euro area as a whole.\u201d Newsflash: The European Commission has cut its growth forecast for Europe this year, and blamed the rising threat of a trade war. The EC now expects the eurozone and the EU to both only grow by 2.1% this year, down from 2.3% predicted three months ago. It reckons that Europe\u2019s economic momentum has \u201cmoderated\u201d after more than a year of strong growth. It has slashed its forecast for German growth to 1.9% in 2018 (down from 2.3%) and also 1.9% in 2019 (down from 2.1%). Britain is now expected to only grow by 1.3% this year (down from 1.5% in the EC\u2019s spring forecasts) and by 1.2% in 2019 (unchanged). That would make the UK the joint-slowest growing EU economy this year, along with Italy. Pierre Moscovici, Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, says the threat of a trade war is hurting Europe\u2019s economy. \u201cGrowth in Europe is set to remain resilient, as monetary policies stay accommodative and unemployment continues to fall. The slight downward revision compared to the spring reflects the impact on confidence of trade tensions and policy uncertainty, as well as rising energy prices. Our forecast is for a continued expansion in 2018 and 2019, although a further escalation of protectionist measures is a clear downside risk. Trade wars produce no winners, only casualties.\u201d Over in Beijing, China has hit out at America\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on $200bn of its goods -- and called on US companies to help. The Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng warned that the escalating trade dispute between the two countries would hurt the global economy, adding: \u201cChina resolutely opposes such behaviour and will have to take the necessary countermeasures. However, we still don\u2019t know exactly how China plans to hit back (as it doesn\u2019t import enough from America to simply impose reciprocal tariffs). Gao suggested that US firms with operations in China could put pressure on the White House to change course. He cited industrial group GE, Qualcomm and carmakers Ford, BMW and Tesla as examples of companies who have recently increased production capacity in China. Trade war fears have forced South Korea\u2019s central bank to cut its growth forecast today. The Bank of Korea has trimmed its growth outlook for South Korea to 2.9%, from 3%. Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol told reporters that the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed between America and other nations are a serious concern. He added that South Korean exports could be hit (echoing the trade ministry\u2019s earlier warning). Ju-yeol said (via Associated Press): \u201cUncertainties in growth path are higher than ever and the major source of the uncertainties is global trade conflicts. At first we thought the trade conflicts among major economies would not grow further, but as they deepen day by day, now it\u2019s very difficult to tell where they\u2019re headed to.\u201d Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University, also thinks America will lose out if it keeps slapping tariffs on Chinese imports. He told CNBC this morning that trade wars are not easy to win (something Donald Trump claimed earlier this year). They\u2019re easy to lose, and the U.S. is on track to lose this trade war. \u201cThis is live ammunition. This is not just rhetorical discussion any more,. \u201cWe\u2019re in the early stages of fighting skirmishes in a real, live trade war. The question is, how far does it go? And how significant will the ammunition be in the future?\u201d Wayne McCurrie of South Africa\u2019s First National Bank fears that global growth will be damaged if the US-China trade dispute keeps escalating. Tom Rafferty of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out that China could cushion the blow of tariffs if it allows its currency to weaken. Naeem Aslam of City firm Think Markets expects Beijing to retaliate soon: Trump is serious about punishing China, he is picking up the areas where it would hurt the most. Although, market participants still aren\u2019t factoring in a full trade war. The hope is that China and US would be able to resolve this matter through bilateral agreement. But uncertainty around this matter has anchored up. The sad aspect is none of the parties are ready to throw in the towel yet which makes me think that there is no resolution in insight yet. Beijing has threatened for retaliation action against the current measures. Therefore, over the coming days, I would expect a tit-for-tat reaction from China-unless the bilateral discussions resume between the two parties. The alarming area is if China chooses to go after the multinational companies which are operating in China. Certainly, that is the area where it would create more wounds. We think that the odds are high that China would specifically pick on US firms or at least it would shift the grounds in such a way that other foreign firms would have more privileges being in China on relative perspective. After all, China isn\u2019t going to sit on its hand and see its GDP dragging lower by another 0.2% if the new tariffs become effective. The car industry is also worried by America\u2019s belligerent stance on trade. The labour union of South Korean manufacturer Hyundai warned that tens of thousands of US jobs could be lost if China and the US don\u2019t step back from a trade war. Hyundai employs around 20,000 workers at a factory in Alabama, and also operates plants in China, India, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, and the Czech Republic, as well as in South Korea. In a statement, the company\u2019s union warned that overseas factory could be the first to close if sales are hit. \u201cIf South Korean car exports to the U.S. get blocked and hurt sales, the U.S. factory in Alabama that went into operation in May 2005 could be the first one to be shut down, putting some 20,000 American workers at risk of layoffs. The South Korean trade ministry is worried that demand for its \u2018intermediary goods\u2019 will be hurt, if America imposes tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods. These are products which are assembled to create a final product (for example, memory chips and hard drives used to build a computer). The ministry explained: As Chinese electronics, computers and communications equipment were included in the additional list of tariffs, Korean companies are worried their exports of intermediary goods used in those items could decrease if the tariffs are imposed. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders will be trudging wearily to their desks this morning after last night\u2019s gripping World Cup drama, and worrying about the impact of a US-China trade war. Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on an extra $200bn of Chinese imports is causing rising anxiety. South Korea\u2019s government has weighed in this morning, warning that its exports could be hurt by the escalating dispute between Washington and Beijing. South Korea is a major producer of technological products -- such as components used in electrical devices, computers and mobile phones. It fears that demand for these exports could slide if the global trade systems gums up. Deputy Minister for Trade Kang Sung-chun told Reuters that Seoul is watching the situation closely: \u201cWe have detailed analysis (on which products will be affected by the U.S.-China trade war),\u201d \u201cThe impact will be mixed. There will be both positive and negative effects. Some Korean exports could replace Chinese goods to be slapped with tariffs, for example. Global stock markets fell heavily yesterday after the US Trade Representative outlined plans for a 10% tariff on other 6,000 individual Chinese imports (everything from meat and vegetables to stamps and baseball mitts). The FTSE 100 lost 1.3%, or 100 points, while the Dow Jones industrial average ended down 219 points or 0.9%. Shares are rising a little this morning, but any fresh retaliations between the two sides could undermine the rally. Also coming up today The pound could be lively as the UK government publishes its eagerly-awaited Brexit white paper, outlining its preferred future relationship with the EU. The Bank of England is publishing a new assessment of credit conditions, and we also get the latest US inflation data.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s heatwave has hit sales at the homeware retailers DFS Furniture and Dunelm, compounding difficult conditions on the high street and forcing both companies to warn profits this year would be below expectations. Shares in DFS tumbled 10% in early trading after it blamed the long hot spell for a big fall in orders and told the City that earnings in the current financial year would be lower than in 2017 \u2013 its second profit warning in just over a year. Dunelm cut its forecast further after issuing a profit warning in May. The heatwave and the World Cup have given other retailers and pub groups a much-needed boost, bringing shoppers back to the embattled high street, and lifting beer, barbecue and big-screen TV sales in particular. But DFS and Dunelm said hot weather put consumers off buying sofas and home furnishings such as curtains, rugs and bedding. DFS, which recently bought the sofa retailer Sofology and also owns Dwell and Sofa Workshop, said: \u201cIn the fourth quarter to date, exceptionally hot weather, including over key trading weekends, has led to significantly lower-than-expected order intake.\u201d The company has also suffered disruption to ships bringing made-to-order products from east Asia. This means like-for-like revenues are 3% down from last year over the 23 weeks to 7 July, and 4% lower over the 49 weeks to 7 July. DFS warned profit for the year to the end of July would fall below last year\u2019s \u00a382.4m. Until Thursday, City analysts had been forecasting a small rise in profit to \u00a384.5m. Dunelm, Britain\u2019s biggest homeware chain \u2013 which like DFS trades from out-of-town superstores in retail parks \u2013 has also been hit by weak consumer spending. It ended up with more leftover stock than usual after its summer sale, which has hurt profit margins. DFS expects the furniture retail market to remain tough over the next 12 months, arguing consumer confidence remains weak. Analysts say big-ticket items tend to be the first things consumers cut back on when they feel the pinch, while homeware sales also tend to suffer during hot weather. Like-for-like sales at Dunelm\u2019s stores fell 4.6% in the 13 weeks to 30 June, but once online sales were factored in \u2013 up nearly 42% \u2013 sales were flat.

      "bodyText": "The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has urged the British government to dramatically increase public spending on rail, green energy and digital infrastructure to support the economy\u2019s long-term future, saying that ministers could treble their investment over the longer term. The Paris-based thinktank, which has 34 of the richest countries as members, said the UK\u2019s lack of public investment since the financial crash in 2008 was a drag on economic growth. It said a spending increase from around 2.9% of GDP at the moment to 6% would need a large increase in taxes but would boost GDP by at least 3% and, over the longer term, need only a rise in taxes or borrowing worth 1% of GDP to do it, offering the biggest return compared to other policy moves. While the report, which looks ahead to the challenges faced by major economies over the next 40 years, warns that a global trade war triggered by the US will damage the long-term outlook, it said growth and living standards will continue to rise across the OECD. \u201cPermanently raising public investment in all OECD countries to 6% of GDP raises aggregate living standards by more than 4% by 2060 (as much as 6-9% in some countries). Fiscal burdens rise by much less than the cost of the additional investment and the policy is even self-financing in some countries,\u201d it said. The report will be welcomed by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who has championed public investment, especially in transport, in his first two budgets. In the aftermath of the financial crash, public investment was cut to 1.5% by the former chancellor George Osborne before Hammond succeeded him and pledged annual rises for the rest of the current parliament to 2022. However, reaching a public investment target of 6.5% of GDP \u2013 which is the average achieved by Luxembourg, Hungary, New Zealand, Slovenia and Norway \u2013 is likely to be considered a stretch too far for a Tory chancellor. The OECD said the UK had made progress towards reforming its pensions system, liberalising product markets and making the labour market more flexible to improve output and growth, making public investment among the most fruitful policy areas. Pension reforms mean that the UK is less likely to be badly hit than other OECD countries by the extra health and retirement costs stemming from an ageing population. A trade war involving the US, China and the European Union that returns the world to tariffs last seen in 1990 would depress long-run living standards by 14% for the world as a whole and as much as 15-25% in the most affected countries, the OECD said.",

      "bodyText": "New data from the Bureau of Statistics reveals just how drastically over the past seven years we have shifted towards white-collar and service-sector jobs and also how much of the surge in new jobs last year was due to a big uptake in workers taking a second job. The labour force figures are often touted as recording the number of \u201cjobs\u201d, whereas in reality they count the number of employed. There are actually more jobs than employed people because some people work more than one job. This discrepancy is also a problem for the ABS because while its labour force figures come from a survey of people, much of its information about jobs \u2013 such as job vacancies \u2013 comes from surveying businesses. The ABS has been trying to marry-up the data. Last year it released its first annual labour account data, and this week it has now released the first of the quarterly series of the data. The hope is to have the quarterly labour account figures be released in line with the quarterly national account GDP figures. This would mean data on the labour side of the economy would be nicely joined with that of the production and consumption side. And this is important because, while the monthly labour force figures provide a great deal of information, they don\u2019t tell us everything about how people are working. One key measure that this new data shows is the growing number of people holding a second job. Over the seven years from September 2010 to September 2017, the number of people working has risen by 11.1%, but the number of people working in secondary jobs has risen by 13.8%. In the 12 months to September last year, secondary jobs grew by 7% compared with 2.8% growth in \u201cmain jobs\u201d: The growth of secondary jobs accounted for 15% of all new jobs in that 12-month period \u2013 which is a stunning amount, given even with this surge, only 7% of employees work more than one job. But that current level is well up from the recent low of 6.6% at the end of 2016: While the current figures are not too alarming, the increase in secondary jobs in the recent past does fit within the narrative of flat household incomes, low wages growth and rising underemployment. The only reason you work a second job is because your main job is not paying enough money, either due to a low base rate of pay or too few hours. The big growth in people taking a second job suggests the below-inflation wage growth is having an impact and forcing people to get a second job to make ends meet. The split of jobs into main and secondary also highlights the quality of job growth across industries. In the 12 months to September last year, real estate services, and the information media and technology industries, saw a decline in the number of main jobs but a surge in the number of secondary jobs. Similarly, 92% of the new jobs in the administration and support industry were secondary jobs. This last point is not too surprising because the administration and support industry is the main source of secondary jobs. It only accounts for 5.1% of all main jobs in the economy, but a stunning 20% of all secondary jobs: The figures also highlight the shift in the nature of our work. In 2010, construction and manufacturing were the third and fourth most common industries for jobs. Now they rank sixth and seventh, having been overtaken by three services industries \u2013 accommodation and food services, professionals, scientific and technology, and education: The shift from blue-collar to white-collar work and also to the services sector is seen most starkly when we compare the number of jobs in manufacturing and in the professional, scientific and technology, and accommodation and food services industries. Seven years ago the number of jobs in all three industries was roughly the same. Now there are more than 1.1m jobs for people working in accommodation and foods services and in professions such as architecture, engineering, computer systems design, law and accountancy. By contrast, the number of jobs in manufacturing has fallen to 870,000: And this also highlights the problems of the changing economy. Unsurprisingly, given the level of expertise required to be an engineer or lawyer, the average income of workers in those industries are higher than in manufacturing \u2013 an average income per hour of $55.80, compared with $43.60. So in that regard the shift from manufacturing to white-collar work would appear to be a general good for the economy \u2013 as people are on average moving to higher-paying work. But while the white-collar jobs may pay more, the jobs in the accommodation and food services sector do not. In September 2016, the average hourly rate of income for those workers was just $23.00. It reflects why, even though in the 12 months to September 2017 the average hourly income for workers in the professional, scientific and technology industry rose 2.8%, the average hourly income for all jobs actually fell 0.2% from $45.19 to $45.08 \u2013 workers overall were shifting from higher-paying jobs to lower-paying ones: This new data from the Bureau of Statistics will certainly become a valuable source of information for policymakers. Over the past few years the rise of underemployment has become a key issue, but this new series of data will also allow us to chart where the new jobs are going, and whether what we\u2019re seeing is a growth of people getting jobs, or more people having to work multiple jobs in lower-paying industries in order to pay the bills. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

The big growth in people taking a second job suggests the below-inflation wage growth is having an impact and forcing people to get a second job to make ends meet. </p> <p>The split of jobs into main and secondary also highlights the quality of job growth across industries. </p> <p>In the 12 months to September last year, real estate services, and the information media and technology industries, saw a decline in the number of main jobs but a surge in the number of secondary jobs. </p> <p>Similarly, 92% of the new jobs in the administration and support industry were secondary jobs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Growth of jobs Sept 2016 to Sept 2017 by industry\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xGI5O/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This last point is not too surprising because the administration and support industry is the main source of secondary jobs. It only accounts for 5.1% of all main jobs in the economy, but a stunning 20% of all secondary jobs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breakdown of main and secondary jobs by industry\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AA3LZ/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The figures also highlight the shift in the nature of our work.</p> <p>In 2010, construction and manufacturing were the third and fourth most common industries for jobs. Now they rank sixth and seventh, having been overtaken by three services industries \u2013 accommodation and food services, professionals, scientific and technology, and education:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in breakdown of jobs from 2010 to 2017\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fA78g/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The shift from blue-collar to white-collar work and also to the services sector is seen most starkly when we compare the number of jobs in manufacturing and in the professional, scientific and technology, and accommodation and food services industries. </p> <p>Seven years ago the number of jobs in all three industries was roughly the same. Now there are more than 1.1m jobs for people working in accommodation and foods services and in professions such as architecture, engineering, computer systems design, law and accountancy. By contrast, the number of jobs in manufacturing has fallen to 870,000:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Shift in jobs from blue collar to white collar and services\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bkegW/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And this also highlights the problems of the changing economy. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, given the level of expertise required to be an engineer or lawyer, the average income of workers in those industries are higher than in manufacturing \u2013 an average income per hour of $55.80, compared with $43.60. So in that regard the shift from manufacturing to white-collar work would appear to be a general good for the economy \u2013 as people are on average moving to higher-paying work.</p> <p>But while the white-collar jobs may pay more, the jobs in the accommodation and food services sector do not. In September 2016, the average hourly rate of income for those workers was just $23.00.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/01/whatever-happened-to-wage-rises-in-australia\">Whatever happened to wage rises in Australia?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It reflects why, even though in the 12 months to September 2017 the average hourly income for workers in the professional, scientific and technology industry rose 2.8%, the average hourly income for all jobs actually fell 0.2% from $45.19 to $45.08 \u2013 workers overall were shifting from higher-paying jobs to lower-paying ones: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average hourly income per employed person\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QeC0G/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This new data from the Bureau of Statistics will certainly become a valuable source of information for policymakers. Over the past few years the rise of underemployment has become a key issue, but this new series of data will also allow us to chart where the new jobs are going, and whether what we\u2019re seeing is a growth of people getting jobs, or more people having to work multiple jobs in lower-paying industries in order to pay the bills<a href=\"xhttp://www.theguardian.com\">.</a></p> <p>\u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist</p>",
