    "webTitle": "Every little hurts: Tesco's battle to regain markets and reputation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest supermarket has stores in nearly every town, but Tesco's crown has slipped after its first profit warning in 20 years and questions over its food quality, stores, customer service and international ambitions. This week, Philip Clarke will report on how his efforts to revive the retailer are progressing in the company's six-monthly update. Clarke, who took charge in 2011, announced a six-point plan to get the vital UK business back on its feet 18 months ago following its first profit fall in two decades. He promised to improve service, make prices and promotions more attractive and stores more friendly. Yet UK performance remains poor, and analysts predict underlying sales will be flat or slightly down. The latest market data, meanwhile, indicates that Tesco is continuing to lose market share both to discounters such as Aldi and quality experts like Waitrose. Tesco operates as far afield as South Korea and Turkey, but what happens in the UK is critical, as business at home accounts for about three-quarters of profits. The good news this week is that profits will be up slightly in the UK \u2013 but analysts don't expect that performance to offset problems abroad \u2013 so overall Clarke will have to reveal that profits have slipped again. It's clear he faces challenges overseas and online, and investors will be watching this week's announcements closely for more detail about how Tesco intends to fight back. Stores After two decades of building ever larger stores, Clarke last year called an end to the supermarket space race, conceding that shoppers had fallen out of love with large out-of-town branches. Tesco will now stick to sites of less than 80,000 sq ft, and Clarke is selling off development land. But with fewer big stores planned, and an already vast number of convenience outlets, how can Tesco rebuild its declining market share in the UK? Clarke is continuing to open some new branches, but is spending \u00a31bn to \"put the love back\" into existing stores, which had become too clinical and where service standards had also slipped. The retailer has put in thousands more staff to improve service and has been testing new ideas in existing stores, such as artisan bakeries run by Euphorium, a specialist baker based in Islington in London; and upmarket Harris + Hoole coffee shops and Giraffe restaurants \u2013 all businesses that Tesco has invested in over the past two years. But so far just three out of at least 50 stores with too much space have been tackled. The company is also using data from its Clubcard loyalty scheme to help tailor the product range and environment to suit local markets more effectively. But, again, just a handful of sites have had a facelift to date. City investors and analysts will want to hear from Clarke how he can do more, cost-effectively, to revive the rest of Tesco's estate. Having already written down the value of land banked for development, but no longer needed, by \u00a3800m, Clarke must also explain how the supermarket can dispose of its assets without further losses. Prices, food, image Last year, Clarke conceded that Tesco's prices had lost their competitive edge. Since then, the company's image has been tarnished further by its links to the horsemeat scandal, strawberry mis-selling and most recently a \"British\" pork chop that tests suggested came from elsewhere. Perhaps Clarke's toughest job is to turn around customer mistrust of the quality of Tesco's food following all those scandals. Despite the economic downturn, strong sales growth at Sainsbury's, Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer show that shoppers see good quality food as important, even when money is tight. Tesco has promised to get more meat from the UK and Ireland but so far has only announced definite plans to source 100% of its fresh chicken here, where it is merely catching up with rivals. The retailer recently launched a fight back with a \"love every mouthful\" marketing campaign and has reorganised stores to make fresh food more prominent. Andrew Kasoulis, an analyst at Credit Suisse, suggests that Tesco's fresh food sales are now rising but other retail watchers say Tesco must invest more in the quality of its food to convince shoppers it has changed. An important part of that will be the relaunch of Tesco's \"Finest\" range in the next few weeks. One smart move is the company's \"price promise\" promotion, where it refunds the difference if shoppers could have paid less for their basket of goods at its three main rivals. The deal is similar to Sainsbury's successful Brand Match campaign, in helping to convince customers that they don't need to shop around \u2013 but there are other competitors. While some shoppers chasing quality are heading to upmarket rivals, others seeking value are deserting for discounters such as Lidl and Aldi. Tesco recently revamped its low-priced Everyday Value range to help it to compete against the discounters, but some analysts argue that what the grocer really needs, to keep shoppers loyal, is to reduce its profit margins and make its main Tesco brand cheaper. Technology Tesco led the way in online shopping and is still by far the biggest internet grocer. But competition has hotted up. Clarke has realised that technology and the internet are a key part of Tesco's future and is now responding with a wave of initiatives. Last week, the supermarket launched the Hudl, its own tablet computer \u2013 perhaps the most positive news to come out of Tesco for some time. The gadget, which has so far been well received and is priced \u00a3119, or less than \u00a3100 with Clubcard points \u2013 shows the company being innovative and bold. Its performance will be watched closely, but perhaps Hudl's most important role is to tie Tesco customers into fast-growing online services, which are all available using one button nestled in the corner of the Hudl screen. A specialist centre in Farringdon, London, is about to open where 275 IT experts will be developing a suite of Tesco apps for mobile devices. The company has also invested in Rainmaking Loft, a workspace in St Katharine Docks near the Tower of London, for young tech entrepreneurs whom Tesco can tap for new ideas. It is also developing Blinkbox, a service to stream films and TV, which it bought two years ago and should allow the company to go head-to-head with Netflix and Lovefilm. By Christmas it will also offer an ebook service. The company's new army of young IT specialists is expected to dream up exciting ways to combine big retail power with the internet, which will be vital if Tesco is to remain relevant. The retailer has also been expanding its click-and-collect grocery service, with plans to double the number of stores where shoppers can pick up goods ordered online to 300 by next spring. It is also rolling out collection points for items such as fashion and homewares to its vast estate of convenience stores after increasing the number of products available on the site to 300,000. International Tesco was once proud of its status as Britain's most successful retailer overseas. But that image has been battered in the last two years as Clarke decided to scrap Fresh &amp; Easy, a failed venture in the US, at a cost of more than \u00a31bn. He has also pulled out of Japan \u2013 costing another \u00a340m \u2013 and last month did a deal to fold Tesco's 130 Chinese stores into a joint venture with a larger local partner. Analysts viewed the move \u2013 nine years after Tesco's first store in the country \u2013 as a surrender. In his previous role as head of international operations, Clarke unveiled plans to open 80 vast shopping malls across China that would have made its retail portfolio bigger than the UK. But the closures have not put an end to Tesco's overseas problems. Next week Clarke is expected to report a decline in profits and sales in nearly every country of operation over the last six months \u2013 with poor trade in Europe, particularly Poland and Turkey, adding to difficulties in Korea. Some analysts argue Clarke should withdraw from markets where sales are in reverse, but with fewer opportunities for growth at home, he needs to find new areas of expansion \u2013 and getting the formula right in Europe is vital.",

This week, Philip Clarke will report on how his efforts to revive the retailer are progressing in the company's six-monthly update.</p> <p>Clarke, who took charge in 2011, announced a six-point plan to get the vital UK business back on its feet 18&#xa0;months ago following its first profit fall in two decades. He promised to improve service, make prices and promotions more attractive and stores more friendly. Yet UK performance remains poor, and analysts predict underlying sales will be flat or slightly down. The latest market data, meanwhile, indicates that Tesco is continuing to lose market share both to discounters such as Aldi and quality experts like Waitrose.</p> <p>Tesco operates as far afield as South Korea and Turkey, but what happens in the UK is critical, as business at home accounts for about three-quarters of profits. The good news this week is that profits will be up slightly in the UK \u2013 but analysts don't expect that performance to offset problems abroad \u2013 so overall Clarke will have to reveal that profits have slipped again. It's clear he faces challenges overseas and online, and investors will be watching this week's announcements closely for more detail about how Tesco intends to fight back.</p> <h2><strong>Stores</strong></h2> <p>After two decades of building ever larger stores, Clarke last year called an end to the supermarket space race, conceding that shoppers had fallen out of love with large out-of-town branches. Tesco will now stick to sites of less than 80,000 sq ft, and Clarke is selling off development land.</p> <p>But with fewer big stores planned, and an already vast number of convenience outlets, how can Tesco rebuild its declining market share in the UK?</p> <p>Clarke is continuing to open some new branches, but is spending \u00a31bn to \"put the love back\" into existing stores, which had become too clinical and where service standards had also slipped. The retailer has put in thousands more staff to improve service and has been testing new ideas in existing stores, such as artisan bakeries run by Euphorium, a specialist baker based in Islington in London; and upmarket Harris + Hoole coffee shops and Giraffe restaurants \u2013 all businesses that Tesco has invested in over the past two years. But so far just three out of at least 50 stores with too much space have been tackled.</p> <p>The company is also using data from its Clubcard loyalty scheme to help tailor the product range and environment to suit local markets more effectively. But, again, just a handful of sites have had a facelift to date.</p> <p>City investors and analysts will want to hear from Clarke how he can do more, cost-effectively, to revive the rest of Tesco's estate. Having already written down the value of land banked for development, but no longer needed, by \u00a3800m, Clarke must also explain how the supermarket can dispose of its assets without further&#xa0;losses.</p> <h2><strong>Prices, food, image</strong></h2> <p>Last year, Clarke conceded that Tesco's prices had lost their competitive edge. Since then, the company's image has been tarnished further by its links to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/tesco-sales-fall-horsemeat-scandal\" title=\"Tesco sales tumble on horsemeat scandal\">horsemeat scandal</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/19/tesco-strawberry-deal-fine-birmingham\" title=\"Tesco 'half-price strawberries' deal prompts red faces and 300,000 fine\">strawberry mis-selling</a> and most recently a \"British\" pork chop <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24081526\" title=\"\">that tests suggested came from elsewhere</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps Clarke's toughest job is to turn around customer mistrust of the quality of Tesco's food following all those scandals.</p> <p>Despite the economic downturn, strong sales growth at Sainsbury's, Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer show that shoppers see good quality food as important, even when money is tight.</p> <p>Tesco has promised to get more meat from the UK and Ireland but so far has only announced definite plans to source 100% of its fresh chicken here, where it is merely catching up with rivals.</p> <p>The retailer recently launched a fight back with a \"love every mouthful\" marketing campaign and has reorganised stores to make fresh food more prominent. Andrew Kasoulis, an analyst at Credit Suisse, suggests that Tesco's fresh food sales are now rising but other retail watchers say Tesco must invest more in the quality of its food to convince shoppers it has changed. An important part of that will be the relaunch of Tesco's \"Finest\" range in the next few weeks.</p> <p>One smart move is the company's \"price promise\" promotion, where it refunds the difference if shoppers could have paid less for their basket of goods at its three main rivals. The deal is similar to Sainsbury's successful Brand Match campaign, in helping to convince customers that they don't need to shop around \u2013 but there are other competitors.</p> <p>While some shoppers chasing quality are heading to upmarket rivals, others seeking value are deserting for discounters such as Lidl and Aldi. Tesco recently revamped its low-priced Everyday Value range to help it to compete against the discounters, but some analysts argue that what the grocer really needs, to keep shoppers loyal, is to reduce its profit margins and make its main Tesco brand cheaper.</p> <h2><strong>Technology</strong></h2> <p>Tesco led the way in online shopping and is still by far the biggest internet grocer. But competition has hotted up. Clarke has realised that technology and the internet are a key part of Tesco's future and is now responding with a wave of initiatives.</p> <p>Last week, the supermarket launched the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/23/tesco-launch-hudl-computer-tablet\" title=\"Tesco launches Hudl tablet computer\">Hudl</a>, its own tablet computer \u2013 perhaps the most positive news to come out of Tesco for some time.</p> <p>The gadget, which has so far been well received and is priced \u00a3119, or less than \u00a3100 with Clubcard points \u2013 shows the company being innovative and bold. Its performance will be watched closely, but perhaps Hudl's most important role is to tie Tesco customers into fast-growing online services, which are all available using one button nestled in the corner of the Hudl screen.</p> <p>A specialist centre in Farringdon, London, is about to open where 275 IT experts will be developing a suite of Tesco apps for mobile devices.</p> <p>The company has also invested in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/13/tesco-backs-rainmaking-loft-london-technology-hub\" title=\" Tesco backs Rainmaking Loft technology hub in London\">Rainmaking Loft</a>, a workspace in St&#xa0;Katharine Docks near the Tower of London, for young tech entrepreneurs whom Tesco can tap for new ideas.</p> <p>It is also developing Blinkbox, a service to stream films and TV, which it bought two years ago and should allow the company to go head-to-head with Netflix and Lovefilm. By Christmas it will also offer an ebook service.</p> <p>The company's new army of young IT specialists is expected to dream up exciting ways to combine big retail power with the internet, which will be vital if Tesco is to remain relevant.</p> <p>The retailer has also been expanding its click-and-collect grocery service, with plans to double the number of stores where shoppers can pick up goods ordered online to 300 by next spring. It is also rolling out collection points for items such as fashion and homewares to its vast estate of convenience stores after increasing the number of products available on the site to 300,000.</p> <h2><strong>International</strong></h2> <p>Tesco was once proud of its status as Britain's most successful retailer overseas. But that image has been battered in the last two years as Clarke decided <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/09/fresh-not-easy-tesco-british-failure-america\" title=\"Fresh, but not so easy: Tesco joins a long list of British failure in America\">to scrap Fresh &amp; Easy</a>, a failed venture in the US, at a cost of more than \u00a31bn.</p> <p>He has also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/18/tesco-japan-sells\" title=\"Tesco offloads Japanese operation\">pulled out of Japan</a> \u2013 costing another \u00a340m \u2013 and last month did a deal to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/09/tesco-withdraws-brand-china-joint-venture\" title=\" Tesco set to withdraw brand from China in new joint venture\">fold Tesco's 130 Chinese stores into a joint venture</a> with a larger local partner. Analysts viewed the move \u2013 nine years after Tesco's first store in the country \u2013 as a surrender.</p> <p>In his previous role as head of international operations, Clarke unveiled plans to open 80 vast shopping malls across China that would have made its retail portfolio bigger than the UK. But the closures have not put an end to Tesco's overseas problems. Next week Clarke is expected to report a decline in profits and sales in nearly every country of operation over the last six months \u2013 with poor trade in Europe, particularly Poland and Turkey, adding to difficulties in Korea. Some analysts argue Clarke should withdraw from markets where sales are in reverse, but with fewer opportunities for growth at home, he needs to find new areas of expansion \u2013 and getting the formula right in Europe is vital.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nothing about the reaction to Ed Miliband's pledge to cap consumers' energy bills last week should have been surprising. The big six power firms issued grim threats that the lights would go out, and the Tories claimed Labour were dragging Britain back to the bad old statist days of the 1970s. The utility barons' furious reaction was easy to write off, as special pleading, and will have done Miliband no harm at all: along with bankers, fat cat energy bosses (Centrica's Sam Laidlaw took home \u00a35m in each of the last two years) are among the most reviled of the capitalist \"predators\" the Labour leader says he wants to tame. A windfall tax, 1997-style, might have been economically cleaner, and could have been tweaked later in the event of a sharp rise in wholesale prices. But a price cap for shivering families is much better politics. It directly targets one of the biggest outgoings for many households and puts flesh on the bones of what had previously been Miliband's rather abstract notion of a \"cost-of-living crisis\". Since it came ready-packaged with a longer-term plan for fixing the dysfunctional way the energy market works \u2013 by splitting production and supply \u2013 it also avoided being a tokenistic gesture. The second outraged claim, that Labour is returning to its lefty, nationalising, interventionist roots, bears closer examination, because it says a lot about the state of politics in Britain today. To some extent, the left/right, nationalise-it/let-the-market-rip dichotomy has always been a red herring. Conservative governments, not least this one, have always \"intervened\" in markets: that's part of the state's job. While George Osborne will inevitably accuse Miliband of being an unreformed, nanny-statist, trade union stooge at his own conference outing this week, the centrepiece of the chancellor's March budget was Help to Buy, a scheme that involves the taxpayer subsidising mortgages. His rationale of fixing a \"market failure\" could equally well be applied to Labour's plan. Miliband's suggestion last week that Labour could force developers sitting on empty land with planning permission to get on with building or face sanctions was aired earlier this year by the International Monetary Fund, hardly a bastion of socialism; and the Tory mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has promised to make increasing use of compulsory purchase orders to deal with the same problem. With Ed Balls asking the Office for Budget Responsibility to confirm it can barely get a cigarette paper between his post-2015 spending plans and Osborne's, it's not surprising there's a school of thought that, in concrete policy terms, there's little to choose between the parties economically. Labour has no intention of abandoning central bank independence or junking fiscal prudence. Yet for all that, Miliband will have been happy with the \"Red Ed\" sound and fury that followed last week's speech, because he believes New Labour took on too much of what his adviser Lord (Stewart) Wood describes as the post-1979 settlement \u2013 and he's ready to junk it. In an article in the latest Political Quarterly, Wood elucidates what he takes the phrase One Nation Labour to mean; and part of it is rejecting the Thatcherite faith in \"maximally free markets, deregulation, minimal taxation for the wealthiest and trickle-down economics\". So taking on the energy companies is not just a bid to pep up the faithful and give Labour candidates something to offer swing voters on the doorstep: it's a conscious statement of intent \u2013 and the more conciliatory tone of some Tories later in the week suggested Miliband's on to something. The extraordinarily traumatic financial and economic crisis that began more than five years ago has forced pained politicians to rethink the way banks are regulated, but there has been scant acknowledgement that there are lessons for the rest of UK plc, too. The boardroom largesse that made a small number of senior staff staggeringly rich and left the average worker diving into debt to maintain living standards \u2013 with destabilising effects on the economy as a whole \u2013 was hardly confined to firms in the Square Mile and Canary Wharf. Neither was reckless short-termism, nor widespread, wholesale tax avoidance, nor crappy, insecure job contracts. The coalition has made piecemeal progress in some of these areas. Vince Cable is working at the European level to end the practice of quarterly reporting, which drives boards to prioritise short-term returns over the longer-term soundness of the company, while George Osborne has backed OECD proposals for international tax reform. But the Tories' initial knee-jerk response to the energy plans \u2013 Michael Foot was mentioned more than once \u2013 betrayed the fact that for them the post-'79 settlement, with its promise to let the wealth creators rip and the market decide, is very much alive. So far, Miliband's alternative to that long-held cross-party consensus is still a fairly thin one, even after the past week: it involves building more homes and expecting the rich to bear a larger share of taxation. Wood's musings suggest that, as it is fleshed out in the runup to the 2015 election, it may also mean tougher constraints on corporate excess, better bargaining power for workers, and the restoration of the contributory principle in the welfare state. Taken together, all this just might add up to a coherent platform for making markets work better for society. As yet, there is far less of a clear vision from Labour about how best to generate sustainable economic growth, in an environment in which public money is tight, business investment has continued to decline rapidly and households remain heavily indebted. Busting open the banking sector might be a good start \u2013 but perhaps that will have to wait for next year's conference.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mary Rogers has worked at the Post Office all her life. When she started behind the counters in 1971, aged 16, Edward Heath was in Downing Street and you could buy a stamp, with freshly minted decimal coins, for 3p. Many of the customers are old friends who give her cards at Christmas. But tomorrow \u2013 along with 4,000 other post office workers \u2013 Mary will be on the picket line, a reluctant striker in an increasingly bitter industrial dispute. This will be the 12th strike since Easter Sunday, as the Post Office embarks on one of its biggest shakeups since the General Post Office was abolished in 1969. Yet, so far, the sweeping changes have attracted far less attention than the plans to sell off the Royal Mail \u2013 the delivery service that was split from the Post Office counters business in 2012. As the government begins the sale of Royal Mail in October, the Post Office is planning to turn almost one fifth of 372 flagship crown branches into smaller franchised outlets in supermarkets and newsagents. Crown offices only make up 3% of the Post Office's 11,800 branches, but they draw in 20% of customers and sell 40% of financial service products sold by the Post Office \u2013 a crucial growth area for the loss-making network. The franchise plans will not affect the bright airy crown office in Derby, where Rogers works, but she is worried about the fate of colleagues in nearby branches. \"We provide such a vital service,\" she says. \"It is a core part of the town, I don't like the idea of it being at the back of Wilko's.\" She also fears some of her co-workers could lose their jobs if the crown branches transfer into shops: \"Our jobs, thank God, are all right. But it is about other people.\" The Communication Workers Union, which represents post office workers, says the franchise plans will result in the loss of 1,500 jobs, although the Post Office says there will be no compulsory redundancies and that jobs will be found for those who do not wish to leave the service. The Post Office is in talks with several large retailers, including Asda and McColl's, and hopes to replace 35 crown branches with franchised outlets by next March. It is all part of the \u00a370m plan to create a profitable \"21st-century\" post office, says Roger Gale, general manager of the crown network. The crown in Derby is the model of this swish new, tech-smart Post Office. Out are the long snaking queues and the cashiers behind their \"fortress\" \u2013 thick glass barriers that customers often used to have to shout through. In are plush red seats, private offices for discussions with mortgage advisers \u2013 the Post Office began selling home loans last year \u2013 and cheerful advisers to guide customers around the open-plan shop floor. One post office worker shows the self-service postal machines to Jill Durbin, 71, who is sending a present to her grandson. \"Oh my God, it costs more than the darn sweets,\" she says at the \u00a32.60 cost of sending the small parcel. The change in the crown offices has raised alarm across the country, with councils such as Tory-led Westminster, Hastings and Manchester voting against the plans. Conservative MPs can see that their support will be damaged if post offices close, says Ben Harris-Quinney of conservative thinktank the Bow Group. \"I think both the part-privatisation of the Post Office and now the full privatisation of the Royal Mail are likely to lead to post office closures,\" he says. \"This will damage communities and the Conservative vote.\" Adrian Bailey, the Labour MP who chairs the parliamentary select committee on business, innovation and skills, says some unprofitable crown services have to transfer into shops to stop the network shrinking. \"The fact is, not every post office can last forever,\" he says. The Post Office rejects claims that the franchise plans will lead to closures or poorer service. \"Franchising is to make sure the Post Office stays in those towns and cities in a cost-effective and sustainable way,\" says Gale. The government, which is paying \u00a31.3bn in subsidies into the Post Office over four years, wants the crown branches in profit by March 2015. \"The crown network loses \u00a337m of taxpayers' money every year and we are determined to get rid of that loss,\" says Gale. But for now he doesn't see any end in sight to the dispute. Nor does the union. For post office workers such as Rogers, who lose pay every time they strike, this means the strikes could continue until Christmas, the busiest time for the Post Office. \"Nobody wants to go on strike. But sometimes you have to stand up and be counted,\" she says.",

      "body": "<p>Mary Rogers has worked at the Post Office all her life. When she started behind the counters in 1971, aged 16, Edward Heath was in Downing Street and you could buy a stamp, with freshly minted decimal coins, for 3p.</p> <p>Many of the customers are old friends who give her cards at Christmas. But tomorrow \u2013 along with 4,000 other post office workers \u2013 Mary will be on the picket line, a reluctant striker in an increasingly bitter industrial dispute.</p> <p>This will be the 12th strike since Easter Sunday, as the Post Office embarks on one of its biggest shakeups since the General Post Office was abolished in 1969. Yet, so far, the sweeping changes have attracted far less attention than the plans to sell off the Royal Mail \u2013 the delivery service that was split from the Post Office counters business in 2012.</p> <p>As the government begins the sale of Royal Mail in October, the Post Office is planning to turn almost one fifth of 372 flagship crown branches into smaller franchised outlets in supermarkets and newsagents. Crown offices only make up 3% of the Post Office's 11,800 branches, but they draw in 20% of customers and sell 40% of financial service products sold by the Post Office \u2013 a crucial growth area for the loss-making network. The franchise plans will not affect the bright airy crown office in Derby, where Rogers works, but she is worried about the fate of colleagues in nearby branches.</p> <p>\"We provide such a vital service,\" she says. \"It is a core part of the town, I don't like the idea of it being at the back of Wilko's.\"</p> <p>She also fears some of her co-workers could lose their jobs if the crown branches transfer into shops: \"Our jobs, thank God, are all right. But it is about other people.\" The Communication Workers Union, which represents post office workers, says the franchise plans will result in the loss of 1,500 jobs, although the Post Office says there will be no compulsory redundancies and that jobs will be found for those who do not wish to leave the service.</p> <p>The Post Office is in talks with several large retailers, including Asda and McColl's, and hopes to replace 35 crown branches with franchised outlets by next&#xa0;March.</p> <p>It is all part of the \u00a370m plan to create a profitable \"21st-century\" post office, says Roger Gale, general manager of the crown network.</p> <p>The crown in Derby is the model of this swish new, tech-smart Post Office. Out are the long snaking queues and the cashiers behind their \"fortress\" \u2013 thick glass barriers that customers often used to have to shout through. In are plush red seats, private offices for discussions with mortgage advisers \u2013 the Post Office began selling home loans last year \u2013 and cheerful advisers to guide customers around the open-plan shop floor.</p> <p>One post office worker shows the self-service postal machines to Jill Durbin, 71, who is sending a present to her grandson. \"Oh my God, it costs more than the darn sweets,\" she says at the \u00a32.60 cost of sending the small parcel.</p> <p>The change in the crown offices has raised alarm across the country, with councils such as Tory-led Westminster, Hastings and Manchester voting against the plans. Conservative MPs can see that their support will be damaged if post offices close, says Ben Harris-Quinney of conservative thinktank the Bow Group. \"I think both the part-privatisation of the Post Office and now the full privatisation of the Royal Mail are likely to lead to post office closures,\" he says. \"This will damage communities and the Conservative vote.\"</p> <p>Adrian Bailey, the Labour MP who chairs the parliamentary select committee on business, innovation and skills, says some unprofitable crown services have to transfer into shops to stop the network shrinking. \"The fact is, not every post office can last forever,\" he says.</p> <p>The Post Office rejects claims that the franchise plans will lead to closures or poorer service. \"Franchising is to make sure the Post Office stays in those towns and cities in a cost-effective and sustainable way,\" says Gale.</p> <p>The government, which is paying \u00a31.3bn in subsidies into the Post Office over four years, wants the crown branches in profit by March 2015. \"The crown network loses \u00a337m of taxpayers' money every year and we are determined to get rid of that loss,\" says Gale.</p> <p>But for now he doesn't see any end in sight to the dispute. Nor does the union.</p> <p>For post office workers such as Rogers, who lose pay every time they strike, this means the strikes could continue until Christmas, the busiest time for the Post Office. \"Nobody wants to go on strike. But sometimes you have to stand up and be counted,\" she says.</p>",
