      "bodyText": "Sajid Javid has said that he has received assurances from Tata that it will allow time to find a saviour for its British steelmaking business, including the Port Talbot plant. The business secretary said Tata will impose \u201cno set time-frame\u201d on the sales process and sought to assuage fears that the company could shut the loss-making Port Talbot steelworks within weeks after meeting its senior figures in Mumbai, including the chairman, Cyrus Mistry. Javid said the official sales process for Tata\u2019s steel business will start by Monday, with the company sending out a sales document and appointing advisers. \u201cWhat they have said is that they will allow a reasonable amount of time for this process to be completed,\u201d Javid said. His comments were supported by the tycoon behind Liberty House, which is interested in buying Tata\u2019s UK business. Sanjeev Gupta told the Guardian that it is not in Tata\u2019s interests to close the sites and it would cost the company \u201cbillions and billions\u201d. The government is keen to demonstrate it has a grip on the steel crisis after Javid was forced to return early from a trip to Australia last week when Tata announced it was putting its UK assets up for sale. No minister was in Mumbai last week when the board meeting was held at which the decision was made to reject a costly investment plan and put the British steel business up for sale, and Labour accused the government of being \u201cmissing in action\u201d. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, called on Javid to allow union representatives to be involved in the process to select any potential buyer of the business. \u201cThe workforce\u2019s union representatives have to be part of any negotiation or assessment of bids,\u201d he said, adding that if the government provides taxpayer-backed help to any potential buyer, it must also take a stake. Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, pointed out that the government had had ample warning of the looming crisis in the steel sector, with Labour MPs raising the issue more than 200 times since the general election. But speaking in Mumbai after meeting Tata, Javid said the government was now determined to do everything it could to enable a sale. \u201cThe UK government has made it clear to any potential buyer that we understand that there\u2019s going to be some issues \u2013 whether they\u2019re to do with power, with a plant, with procurement \u2013 whatever those issues are, that we might be able to help with and help further,\u201d said Javid. He added that a number of potential buyers, including Liberty House, had already come forward and said: \u201cWhat I\u2019d like to see is many more come forward, and I hope that\u2019s what happens when the formal process begins, and I\u2019m sure it will.\u201d Gupta, who held talks with Javid on Tuesday, said the UK and Welsh governments were \u201cvery motivated\u201d to find a solution for the steel industry. He also played down fears that Tata could close Port Talbot and the rest of its UK sites before a buyer can be found. \u201cIt is certainly not in their interest in any shape or form to shut it down,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cost would be far, far, far greater [than finding a buyer]. If you talk about the pension liabilities, if you talk about the environmental liabilities, the redundancies \u2013 the costs would be enormous, it would be billions and billions. So I don\u2019t see them wanting to shut it down.\u201d Gupta said the government has stated it will not provide cash towards a rescue deal. \u201cI don\u2019t know about money because they said they can\u2019t do anything which constitutes state aid,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they won\u2019t be able to give anybody money per se, but they can solve problems like power or they can provide commercial loans and things. But they can\u2019t actually give money, that\u2019s against EU regulations.\u201d Gupta admitted that it would be a \u201cbig step forward\u201d for Liberty to buy Tata\u2019s business, which employs 15,000 people, but said that he expects to make a proposal to the Indian company when the sales process start. Trade unions also welcomed Javid\u2019s comments. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, said: \u201cI am encouraged to learn that Tata has committed to be a responsible seller and to allow the time we need to secure a new commercial operator.\u201d Javid\u2019s meeting in India came as the archbishop of Wales, Barry Morgan, warned about the social and economic costs if the Port Talbot plant closes and criticised the government\u2019s inaction. \u201cIt raises the question of an industrial strategy for the UK, since steel is the foundation of the manufacturing base of this country and affects many other industries,\u201d he said. Dr Morgan, who is also bishop of the Diocese of Llandaff, which includes Port Talbot, said: \u201cI am not an economist but it is a fact that business rates in the steel industry in the UK are much higher than in other parts of the EU and energy costs per ton of steel made in the UK are more than double those of Germany.\u201d \u201cThe danger is that if all steelmaking plants are closed, once they are gone, the price of steel will increase and that will have far reaching repercussions on our economy and industry.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A group of former Barclays bank employees accused of conspiring to rig Libor interest rates were paid big bonuses and offered each other wine and coffee in return for favourable rates, a court has heard. Jonathan James Mathew, Stylianos Contogoulas, Jay Vijay Merchant, Alex Pabon, and Ryan Michael Reich deny conspiring to manipulate the US dollar Libor, or London interbank offered rate for more than two years, between 1 June 2005 and 1 September 2007. The third Libor trial in the UK comes after the scandal rocked the financial world and led to billions of dollars in fines for major banks, including Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Deutsche Bank. On the second day of his opening speech at Southwark crown court in London, James Hines QC, a prosecutor for the UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office, said: \u201cMaking money was the name of the game.\u201d He told the jury that Merchant, then director of US fixed income in New York and the line manager of Pabon and Reich, was the highest paid of the group, with a \u00a31.3m package for 2006 and \u00a32.2m for 2007, almost entirely made up of bonuses. Hines told the court the traders were dealing with \u201ceye-watering\u201d sums of money. They stood to gain or lose hundreds of thousands of pounds if they succeeded in manipulating Libor, a key global financial benchmark that determines the cost of borrowing for households and companies. Hines said that moving the Libor rate even by tiny amounts could have a \u201chuge impact on the profitability of the Barclays book\u201d. In February 2006, Pabon wrote in an email: \u201cWe are making money trading like this, so lets keep it up. Hopefully we can get another 200K tomorrow. We are almost there.\u201d Reich was paid $800,000 in 2007, including a $690,000 bonus, while Mathew\u2019s pay package was \u00a3280,750. Pabon was paid a $125,000 salary and a $200,000 bonus in 2005, while Contogoulas received a \u00a360,000 salary and a \u00a3140,000 bonus. Both left Barclays in the summer of 2006, but Contogoulas continued to send requests to the Barclays submitters after he joined a rival bank, Merrill Lynch. The jury heard that on numerous occasions, four derivatives traders \u2013 Merchant, Pabon and Reich, based in New York, and Contogoulas in London \u2013 asked the Libor rate submitters Mathew and co-conspirator Peter Johnson, both based in London, to submit rates that suited their trading at the daily setting of Libor, carried out by 16 banks, including Barclays. In one email in December 2005, Merchant bluntly stated which rate he wanted: \u201c4.48 fixing\u201d \u2013 or \u201cI will get slaughtered\u201d, as he wrote in another message. The email exchanges presented by the prosecution showed that Contogoulas repeatedly offered the Libor submitters coffee or wine in return for favourable rates. In one message he said: \u201cHe [Johnson] has been doing a very good job, I gave him a bottle of wine on Friday to say thank you.\u201d On another occasion Contogoulas joked in an email to Johnson: \u201cRemember when I retire and write a book about this business your name will be written in golden letters \u2026 and you\u2019ll have an open invitation to my bar in the Greek islands he he.\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cI would prefer this not to be in any books!\u201d Hines told the jury: \u201cThe defendants in this case are all very successful, intelligent, well educated and experienced professionals. These men were trusted by Barclays Bank to trade in deals worth billions of dollars.\u201d The case continues.",

These are the companies and individuals that could rescue Port Talbot, Britain\u2019s biggest steelworks in south Wales, and the rest of Tata\u2019s UK steel operations. Liberty House Sanjeev Gupta, the boss of metals group Liberty House, has publicly expressed his interest in buying Tata\u2019s UK business and has held talks with Sajid Javid, the business secretary. Liberty has bought two steel mills from Tata in Scotland, so already knows the company well. In addition, it bought the mothballed Alpha Steel plant in Newport, while Gupta is also involved with the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon. However, trade unions, local MPs and Tata are sceptical about whether he can put together a bid to buy Port Talbot and the rest of Tata\u2019s UK operations. Although Liberty has annual revenues of almost $5bn (\u00a33.6bn), it has never taken on anything of this scale. Gupta has put forward a plan to revitalise Port Talbot. This involves converting its blast furnaces into electric arc furnaces that use scrap steel. However, this would lower production capacity and the government and unions are keen to preserve the blast furnaces. In addition, Gupta is thought to want the government to take on Tata\u2019s pension liabilities and provide substantial financial support towards Port Talbot\u2019s energy costs. Greybull Capital Investment firm Greybull, led by brothers Marc and Nathaniel Meyohas, specialises in turning around struggling businesses. It led a rescue buyout of the airline Monarch, but also backed OpCapita\u2019s acquisition of electricals retailer Comet, which collapsed months later. Greybull is buying Tata\u2019s steelworks in Scunthorpe, which will come with a funding package of about \u00a3400m put together by the government and Tata, which is likely to leave a dowry. Greybull says it is committed to completing this deal, but it is likely to cast an eye over the rest of Tata\u2019s UK business. ThyssenKrupp The German industrial conglomerate was in talks with Tata three months ago about buying the Indian multinational\u2019s European steel business, including Port Talbot and its Dutch sites. However, it is understood to have walked away from a Port Talbot deal owing to concerns about the UK pension scheme, which has 130,000 members and liabilities of \u00a314.5bn, and the mounting losses. Tata sources believe ThyssenKrupp could be encouraged back to the table with significant financial support from the UK government, which is aware of the German company\u2019s interest. The combination of ThyssenKrupp and Tata\u2019s steel businesses would create a major global player that could potentially shield itself against the glut of cheap Chinese imports into Europe. Job losses would be inevitable as the enlarged company consolidated its assets. However, reports in Europe suggest that ThyssenKrupp is focused on combining its European steel asset with Tata without the UK business, which would be closed or sold to another party. This could lead to the formation of a joint venture that is spun off from ThyssenKrupp and Tata. Management buyout Union leaders have backed a turnaround plan for the steel industry that involves about \u00a31.5bn being invested into Tata\u2019s operations over the next decade. They are being advised on the proposals by Syndex UK, an industry consultant. The unions presented the ideas to Javid at a meeting on Monday, asking him to ensure that any new buyer guaranteed to invest in Port Talbot. However, they could decide to try to take control of the sites themselves and activate their own plan. A management buyout, though, will require substantial financial backing from an investor or the government or both. The unions\u2019 plan relies on the government propping up the sites for up to three years before they become self sufficient. Funds to improve Port Talbot and Tata\u2019s other sites would also have to be found.",

      "bodyText": "Premier Foods has laid out ambitious growth plans as it seeks to convince investors to hold out for a better offer from US predator McCormick. The company behind Oxo cubes and Mr Kipling cakes said it had held constructive talks with McCormick, which owns Schwartz dried spices. Premier Foods shares closed up about 5% at 58.5p after the stock market announcement, but are still valued at nearly half of their 2014 peak, depressed by a large debt load and pension liabilities left over from an acquisition spree. It agreed to listen to McCormick\u2019s offer last week, but only after rejecting a 65p-a-share bid that valued the company at \u00a31.5bn including debt. Discussions have included McCormick\u2019s plans for Premier Foods\u2019 sizeable pension scheme, which requires annual payments of more than \u00a350m, according to projections. The talks indicate that a deal could be closer than before, but Premier Foods issued a detailed presentation on Wednesday designed to strengthen its hand with key investors such as Standard Life and the hedge fund manager Paulson &amp; Co. The 44-page document outlines the company\u2019s belief that it can increase sales by more than 4% a year thanks to a tie-up with the Japanese instant noodle company Nissin. Nissin has built a stake of more than 19% in Premier Foods during the takeover saga with McCormick. Premier said investors should consider the potential benefits of the new relationship when assessing the price at which they would be ready to sell. It said it could plug into Nissin\u2019s strength in key markets such as the US, China and Brazil via cooperation on branding and distribution. It also hopes to draw on Nissin\u2019s portfolio of patents to increase sales of its existing products by improving them. The presentation cites Nissin\u2019s low-fat powdered soup \u201cwith mouth-feel of conventional soup\u201d, which it said could improve its Batchelors Cup a Soup. It also highlighted the potential benefits to Batchelors Super Noodles from Nissin\u2019s patent for laser perforation technology, which makes thicker noodles hydrate faster. The benefits of a partnership with Nissin add to Premier\u2019s existing growth plans, which include expansion into the chilled food market and \u201ccake on the go\u201d. It illustrated the potential for its cake to capture more of the \u201con the go\u201d food market, pointing to a Costcutter store in Manchester where its Angel Slice has outsold Snickers and KitKats over a month. The presentation also outlines the company\u2019s plans for expansion in Australia, the US and the Middle East. It expects to spend up to \u00a34m on its growth plans during the 2016-17 financial year. The company said it had already outlined growth plans, excluding its Nissin tie-up, to McCormick\u2019s senior staff after being persuaded to listen to its offer by investors. Paulson &amp; Co and Standard Life, which together hold about 17% of the company\u2019s shares, were instrumental in convincing Premier Foods to listen to McCormick\u2019s offer. The detail Premier Foods provided on the potential of its tie-up with Nissin appears designed to convince them to hold out for an increased bid. The company also said McCormick would \u201cbenefit from significant synergies not reflected in their approach\u201d, but did not expand on the statement in its presentation. The company also reiterated that McCormick\u2019s latest 65p-a-share bid \u201ccontinues to undervalue the Premier Foods business and its prospects\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Why has the $160bn Pfizer-Allergan deal been abandoned? The US Treasury Department announced on Monday changes to rules under which deals could be classified as \u201ctax inversions\u201d, which meant it was no longer as economically attractive for the deal to take place. What is a tax inversion? It is a piece of financial engineering that multinational companies use to reduce their tax bill. One company buys a rival based in a different country with a less onerous tax policy. It then \u201creincorporates\u201d by shifting the address of its headquarters to the country with the lighter tax burden. In many cases the the main business might remain in the original country but the firm simply holds some of its board meetings in the new jurisdiction. What are the rules aimed at preventing tax inversions? The US has made a number of attempts to crack down on so-called \u201cserial inverters\u201d by reducing the tax benefits available to them. Even before this week\u2019s move, The Obama administration had put tighter restrictions on inversions where the US company ends up with a combined stake of between 60% and 80% of its foreign takeover target. The intention was to stop firms buying much smaller foreign rivals simply to switch addresses to a country with a lower tax rate. Now the US Treasury wants to change how it calculates the size of the two companies involved in a deal by ignoring any assets bought by the takeover target from a US company in the past three years. In some cases, that would take the predator company over the 60% threshold by notionally reducing the size of its takeover target. This particularly impacts Pfizer because Allergan has been built through a series of deals. Another new measure targets so-called \u201cearnings stripping\u201d, by classifying loans between related companies as equity during a tax audit. This would also affect the determination of the size of a company. Why do US firms do it? The corporation tax regime in the US is the most onerous among developed economies. American firms are taxed on their domestic earnings at 35% \u2013 although the rate can be higher \u2013 and also on income repatriated from foreign subsidiaries. Most other countries impose a much lower rate than the US on repatriated earnings. If a company can shift its country of incorporation, US tax authorities lose the right to take a slice of income from foreign subsidiaries. This system has led American firms to stash an estimated $2tn (\u00a31.3tn) overseas, rather than repatriate the money. It is also seen as a key motivation behind most tax inversions. Why are they unpopular? Some US firms have been accused of buying smaller European rivals simply to reduce their tax bill, rather than because of any long-term strategic rationale. On Tuesday, President Barack Obama said: \u201cWhen companies exploit loopholes like this it makes it harder to invest in the things that are going to keep America\u2019s economy going strong for future generations.\u201d How old are inversions? The first high-profile inversion took place in 1982, when New Orleans construction firm McDermott moved to Panama, switching its corporate headquarters to the Central American country and slashing the tax rate on its earnings. After a wave of similar deals, the US cracked down in 2004 with an anti-inversion law targeted at firms relocating to tax havens. However, it permitted the company to change address, as long as its merger partner was a quarter of its size or larger. That ruled out moves to tiny tax havens where subsidiaries were unlikely to be big enough to satisfy this criterion. It also made a more attractive destination of Europe, where there are many firms large enough to bypass anti-inversion laws.",

      "bodyText": "Barack Obama\u2019s derailment of Pfizer\u2019s $160bn (\u00a3114bn) merger with Allergan sparked immediate speculation on Wednesday that the US drugs company would turn its attention to another big pharmaceutical takeover. Pfizer, best known for Viagra and its cholesterol pill Lipitor, will pay the Botox producer Allergan $150m for pulling out of what would have been the world\u2019s biggest healthcare deal, first announced in November and now abandoned after the US Treasury Department stunned financial markets with measures to clamp down on tax efficient mergers and takeovers. Shares in the pharmaceutical companies Shire and AstraZeneca were the biggest gainers on the FTSE 100, each rising by more than 4.5%, on speculation that they could be targets for acquisition-hungry Pfizer, which has now failed to pull off two major deals in two years. The merger plan had been motivated by the ability to save as much as $1bn in tax annually by shifting Pfizer\u2019s domicile from New York to Ireland, after Allergan moved its base there a year ago in a similar move. Allergan moved its head office to Dublin after a reverse merger with the Irish drugmaker Actavis. Such deals have been motivated by the US\u2019s relatively high corporation tax rate and its system of taxing profits made overseas as well in the US market. The US president described global tax avoidance on Tuesday as a huge problem, and after the deal was formally abandoned on Wednesday the presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted: \u201cGlad to hear Pfizer is calling off the merger. We need to close the loopholes that let corporations escape paying their taxes.\u201d The Treasury Department did not name Pfizer and Allergan when it announced changes to the rules, but Pfizer blamed the breakdown of the deal on the US government\u2019s move. Allergan\u2019s chief executive, Brent Saunders, a veteran deal maker who has embarked on a number of mergers and acquisitions since joining the company two years ago, also made clear that the deal had been scuppered by the changes. \u201cIt really looked like they [the US government] did a very fine job at constructing a temporary rule to stop this deal and obviously it was successful,\u201d he told CNBC television. Under the changes announced, the merger would not have counted as a so-called tax inversion deal, because the smaller partner, Allergan, could not end up with 40% of the enlarged company because all of its deal-making in the last three years would be excluded from the calculation. Allergan\u2019s shares, which had plunged 15% in the aftermath of the tax changes, were up 3% and Pfizer\u2019s rose 5% after they called off the deal. In 2014, Pfizer\u2019s chief executive, Ian Read, failed to clinch a \u00a370bn takeover of AstraZeneca following resistance from the British drugmaker\u2019s shareholders. Now Read\u2019s ambitions have been thwarted a second time following political invention in the US. Speculation that Scottish-born Reed\u2019s deal with Allergan would fall apart had been mounting since the Treasury Department\u2019s announcement on Monday. While Saunders held a call with investors and made clear that his dealmaking ambitions had not been thwarted, Read was not immediately as visible. He said in a statement that a possible division of Pfizer into two parts \u2013 one focused on patented-protected innovative drugs and the other on older products that have come off patent or are close to it \u2013 was still on the table. \u201cWe plan to make a decision about whether to pursue a potential separation of our innovative and established businesses by no later than the end of 2016, consistent with our original timeframe for the decision prior to the announcement of the potential Allergan transaction,\u201d he said. Even so, there was speculation about his ambitions for future deals. \u201cThe possibility now is that Pfizer goes shopping again, and you might be prepared to develop a case that maybe a firm like Shire becomes the bid target,\u201d Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG, told Reuters. Others were more cautious. \u201cThe market has naturally assumed that with the deal off, [Pfizer] is desperate and must be suddenly on the hunt again. This may not necessarily be the case,\u201d said Tim Anderson, a pharmaceuticals analyst at Sanford Bernstein. He said the fact Pfizer was still talking about a decision by the end of the year about whether to split in two appeared to indicate that the company had \u201cgiven up on inversion of a larger target\u201d such as AstraZeneca or GlaxoSmithKlein, which would still meet the threshold for full US tax relief. Read was urged to find other ways to grow. \u201cPfizer will now need to review its strategy after a lost three years. Other big pharma companies will be following suit,\u201d said John Colley, a professor at Warwick Business School. \u201cPerhaps now Pfizer and other pharmaceutical businesses can focus on drug development rather than financial engineering. In 2015 around $600bn of acquisition activity occurred in the pharmaceutical industry, a significant proportion was driven by US tax rules and avoiding tax,\u201d Colley said. Other deals have fallen foul of US rule changes. Shire, which is based in Dublin for tax purposes but managed in Boston, was to have been taken over by the US drugs group AbbVie in 2014 before the latter pulled out of the agreed deal after a detailed examination of the tax inversion rules. Shire is now itself in the throes of taking over the Illinois-based Baxalta, which develops treatments for rare blood conditions. Read said Pfizer had approached the deal with Allergan \u201cfrom a position of strength and viewed the potential combination as an accelerator of existing strategies \u2026 We remain focused on continuing to enhance the value of our innovative and established businesses\u201d.",

In 2015 around $600bn of acquisition activity occurred in the pharmaceutical industry, a significant proportion was driven by US tax rules and avoiding tax,\u201d Colley said.</p> <p>Other deals have fallen foul of US rule changes.

The Circle app will allow customers to transfer money with messages and emojis, and make currency transfers between pounds and dollars. Euros will be added later. Barclays is providing Circle, which is based in Boston and backed with investments by Goldman Sachs, the infrastructure to operate in the UK. Circle has received an e-money licence from the Financial Conduct Authority, which has granted about 80 such permissions although this is the first one for a company operating a digital currency. The FCA does not regulate bitcoin. Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and chief executive of Circle, said customers would not be buying bitcoin through the app, which allows money transfers without fees. Circle uses bitcoin to facilitate transfers for customers outside its own system.

    "webTitle": "FTSE rises as Pfizer deal collapses  - live updates", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The final scores in Europe showed some reasonable gains in the wake of the oil price rise, itself fuelled by the bigger than expected fall in US crude stocks. A boost to pharmaceutical stocks also helped matters, as investors bet that Pfizer would turn its attention to another target following the collapse of its $160bn deal to buy Allergan. The closing figures for Europe were: The FTSE 100 finished 70.40 points or 1.16% higher at 6161.63 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.64% to 9624.51 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.81% to 4284.64 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.77% to 17,240.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.13% at 8398.6 In Greece, the Athens market bucked the trend, slipping 1.27% to 554.12 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 70 points or 0.4%. On oil, Chris Beauchamp of IG said: The positive sheen on stock markets this afternoon would likely have been more of a thin veneer had it not been for a surge in oil prices thanks to the first fall in US stockpiles in two months. More of this is needed however to convert the still robust community of oil bears that expect further declines. West Texas is up 5.1% at the moment to $37.74 a barrel, while Brent crude is 5.2% higher at $39.84. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The oil price rise has energised markets which were threatening to drift in an uncertain fashion towards the close of trading. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: It\u2019s been a decent session for London\u2019s FTSE-100 with the blue chip index seeing gains accelerate into the close. A large fall in the US crude inventory data is certainly helping bolster sentiment with WTI oil lining up for another go at the $40 a barrel mark and as we keep noting this asset really does seem to be driving momentum for the market as a whole. West Texas Intermediate - the US crude benchmark - is currently up 4.8% at $37.62 while Brent crude is 4.2% better at $39.47. Back with the news that Pfizer and Allergan have called off their merger, and the collapse has been welcomed by the Democratic frontrunner in the US election: Brent crude, which was up around 1.8% before the release of the US crude figures, is now up 2.85% at $38.85 a barrel. David Morrison at Spreadco said: Crude was already in positive territory for the day with WTI and Brent climbing back above their technically-significant levels of $36 and $38 per barrel respectively. This push higher began late yesterday and bucked the downward trend that\u2019s been in place since mid-March. The sell-off over the last few weeks is a reaction to the dysfunction apparent within OPEC ahead of the planned meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to freeze output. Suggestions from Kuwait that there would be a positive announcement on a production freeze at this month\u2019s meeting was partly behind the strength in the oil price earlier in the day. Here is Reuters on the drop in US crude inventories: U.S. crude stocks unexpectedly fell from record highs last week as refineries continued to hike output and imports fell, while gasoline stocks rose, snapping a six-week decline, data from the Energy Information Administration showed on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 4.9 million barrels in the last week, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations for an increase of 3.2 million barrels.... Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose by 357,000 barrels, EIA said. Refinery crude runs, which have remained at record seasonal levels for most of this year thanks to unusually strong gasoline margins, rose by 199,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates rose by 1 percentage point, although usage may ebb with more maintenance expected throughout this month. Gasoline stocks, which swelled this winter to record highs and remain at unusually high levels for this time of year, rose by 1.4 million barrels after six consecutive declines, compared with expectations for a 1.0 million barrels drop. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 1.8 million barrels, versus expectations for a 333,000 barrels drop, the EIA data showed. U.S. crude imports fell last week by 446,000 barrels per day. Here is the notification on the crude move from the Energy Information Administration: A surprise weekly drop in US crude stocks has pushed oil prices even higher. It\u2019s become rather a mixed bag as far as markets are concerned, as Europe heads towards the close of trading. The FTSE 100 is holding onto its gains, up 20 points or 0.3%, but Germany\u2019s Dax is marginally in the red while France\u2019s Cac has managed to edge higher. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost its early gains and is now 49 points or 0.28% lower, ahead of the minutes of last month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Whilst the FTSE held into its oil- and pharma-inspired gains the picture was far more mixed across the rest of the market. The Dow Jones [has slipped], a lack of data and hesitation ahead of this evening\u2019s Fed meeting minutes suppressing the appetite of US investors. It will be interesting to see what is uncovered with the latest insight into the inner workings of the central bank. Reports of discord between a dovish Yellen and the FOMC\u2019s more hawkish members have only grown in the past few weeks, and investors will likely be keen to see what kind of rhetoric was used by both sides in March\u2019s meeting, especially if it helps provide an idea of when the balance might shift in favour of those supporting a rate hike. The FTSE, meanwhile, managed to outperform the rest of the major global indices... thanks to two of its key sectors. Firstly Brent Crude\u2019s $39 per barrel-pushing rebound helped to instil the semblance of stability in the oil stocks (even if their mining peers have been dragged down by a one month low-showing from copper). Secondly the likes of AstraZeneca and Shire saw unexpected growth as the day continued, the fallout from the failed Pfizer/Allergan merger causing many to speculate that the former might be go shopping again to satisfy its M&amp;A-thirst. More detail of the state of the US job market has just been issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The report says: Unemployment rates were lower in February than a year earlier in 296 of the 387 metropolitan areas, higher in 76 areas, and unchanged in 15 areas, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Eleven areas had jobless rates of less than 3.0 percent and 11 areas had rates of at least 10.0 percent. Nonfarm payroll employment increased over the year in 323 metropolitan areas, decreased in 62 areas, and was unchanged in 2 areas. The national unemployment rate in February was 5.2 percent, not seasonally adjusted, down from 5.8 percent a year earlier. In its latest pronouncement ahead of its meeting next week, the International Monetary Fund has called for labour markets to be reformed to boost jobs. Larry Elliott writes: The protracted weakness of the global economy has highlighted the need for lower taxes on employment and higher public spending to get the unemployed back into work, the International Monetary Fund has said. Expressing concern about sluggish growth in the west since the 2008-09 downturn, the Washington-based IMF said it was time for ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing to be accompanied by a range of structural reforms. The IMF issued its advice in a chapter from the half-yearly World Economic Outlook (WEO) released before the report\u2019s publication next week. Romain Duval and Davide Furceri, economists from the IMF\u2019s research department, said: \u201cIn the current environment of persistent weak economic activity in many advanced economies, there is a strong case for product and labour market reforms, complemented by macroeconomic policy support, to boost jobs and growth.\u201d The chapter from the WEO said an example of product market reform would be to make it easier for new firms to break into markets such as retailing and professional services. Labour market reforms included higher public spending to help the jobless find work, cutting unemployment benefits to encourage the jobless to take low-paid work, cutting taxes on employment, and making it easier for employers to hire and fire full-time staff. The full story is here: As the oil price continues to rise, buoyed by hopes of production freezes after comments from Kuwait, US markets are edging higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up while the S&amp;P 500 is 0.09% higher and Nasdaq has added 0.17%. And after falling 15% on Tuesday on talk that its takeover by Pfizer would fall through, Allergan has recovered slightly, up 0.5% at the open. Here\u2019s our latest report on the collapse of the Pfizer and Allergan deal: The world\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical deal was called off on Wednesday when Pfizer and Allergan responded to changes in the US tax regime by abandoning their $160bn merger. In what will be regarded as a victory for the US president, Barack Obama, in his drive to clamp down on tax avoiding deals, Pfizer \u2013 best known for Viagra and its cholesterol pill Lipitor \u2013 will now pay the Botox producer Allergan $150m for pulling out of the deal. The transaction was first announced in November and is the second major deal Pfizer has attempted that has collapsed in two years after it failed to clinch a \u00a370bn takeover of the British drugmaker AstraZeneca in 2014. There was immediate speculation that Pfizer might again turn its attentions to a UK-listed company, with shares in Shire and AstraZeneca each rising by about 3% to lead the FTSE 100 higher. Both Pfizer and Allergan set out their credentials to remain standalone entities, though Pfizer\u2019s chief executive, Ian Read, said a possible division into two parts \u2013 one focused on patented-protected innovative drugs and the other on older products that have come off patent or are close to it \u2013 was still on the table. \u201cWe plan to make a decision about whether to pursue a potential separation of our innovative and established businesses by no later than the end of 2016, consistent with our original timeframe for the decision prior to the announcement of the potential Allergan transaction,\u201d Read said. The full story is here: Most of Europe\u2019s main markets are still up: The pound is down against the dollar and the euro on renewed fears over what an exit from then EU would mean for the UK economy. Sterling fell 0.6% to a near two-year low of 80.85 pence against the euro. It hit a five-week low against the dollar, down 1% at $1.4025. The pound was also down against a basket of currencies at the lowest level since December 2013. The falls came as the latest poll on the EU referendum showed 43% of voters wanted to leave, while 44% were opposed to Brexit. Peter Frank, currency strategist at BBVA: The closeness of opinion polls means that there is a large risk that Brexit could happen. This scenario risks a huge slide in sterling. Foreign direct investment and portfolio flows are needed to recycle the UK\u2019s record trade and current account deficits. A Brexit vote ... could halt such sterling supportive net capital inflows. The FTSE 100 continues to make gains on the back of the collapsed $160bn deal between Viagra-maker Pfizer and Botox-producing Allergan. The index is up 0.7% or 42 points at 6,133, with pharmaceutical companies Shire and AstraZeneca at the top of the leader board, up by 3.7% and 3.4% respectively. Investors appear to be betting that now the deal has collapsed, UK pharma companies might be back on the shopping list. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG: The possibility now is that Pfizer goes shopping again, and you might be prepared to develop a case that maybe a firm like Shire becomes the bid target. The implications of the new [US tax inversion] rules would have to be worked out, but if you\u2019ve got cash sloshing around the sector, people are wondering who will benefit. Allergan\u2019s full statement on the collapse of the Pfizer deal can be found here. The company said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the deal would no longer happen, but argued it still had a strong future as a standalone company. Brent Saunders, chief executive and president: While we are disappointed that the Pfizer transaction will no longer move forward, Allergan is poised to deliver strong, sustainable growth built on a set of powerful attributes. Leading therapeutic franchises with strong brands across seven therapeutic areas provide the foundation for continued strong growth in 2016 and beyond. Our pipeline is one of the strongest in the industry, loaded with 70 mid-to-late stage programs including 14 expected approvals and 16 regulatory submissions in 2016 alone,\u201d Pfizer has officially confirmed that it is walking away from its proposed $160bn deal with Ireland-based Allergan. It follows moves by US President Barack Obama to clamp down on so-called tax inversion deals, where companies relocate their headquarters in order to benefit from lower tax rates. Pfizer said the deal was terminated by \u201cmutual agreement\u201d. It will pay Allergan a break fee of $150m (\u00a3106m). Pfizer said it was pulling out as a result of the proposed changes in the US, which it judged to be an \u201cadverse tax law change\u201d. Ian Read, Pfizer\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said: Pfizer approached this transaction from a position of strength and viewed the potential combination as an accelerator of existing strategies. We remain focused on continuing to enhance the value of our innovative and established businesses. Our most recent product launches, including Prevnar 13 in Adults, Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz, have been well-received in the market, and we believe our late stage pipeline has several attractive commercial opportunities with high potential across several therapeutic areas. We also maintain the financial strength and flexibility to pursue attractive business development and other shareholder friendly capital allocation opportunities. We plan to make a decision about whether to pursue a potential separation of our innovative and established businesses by no later than the end of 2016, consistent with our original timeframe for the decision prior to the announcement of the potential Allergan transaction. As always, we remain committed to enhancing shareholder value. Read the full statement here. S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence has published a report on what impact share price falls in the first quarter have had on the market value of Europe\u2019s top banks. HSBC held on to the top spot despite a near 19% fall in value over the first quarter. S&amp;P notes: HSBC Holdings Plc remains atop the ranking, but with its shares down nearly 19% in the first quarter, its market capitalisation expressed in terms of euros is no longer more than double that of runner-up Lloyds Banking Group Plc. Deutsche Bank AG dropped to 20th by market capitalisation from 14th three months earlier, having seen its shares fall by one-third during the first quarter. PAO Sberbank of Russia rose five spots to 12th, while Allied Irish Banks Plc returned to the top 20 by rising 11 places from 26th. KBC Group NV, Standard Chartered Plc and UniCredit SpA dropped out of the top 20 during the quarter. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP whose Aberavon constituency is home to Tata\u2019s Port Talbot plant has been speaking of his hopes that a deal can be done to save the steel plant. This from Guardian reporter Sean Farrell: Losses at Tata Steel have halved from the previously reported \u00a31m a day, giving weight to management\u2019s claims that it can turn the business around, the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said. Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency is home to Tata\u2019s Port Talbot plant, said the government should not rush into backing the wrong deal for the business,which Tata put up for sale last week. He welcomed the interest of metals magnate Sanjeev Gupta in a possible rescue plan but was doubtful about Gupta\u2019s proposal to replace Port Talbot\u2019s giant steelmaking blast furnace with an operation built around recycling scrap steel. Kinnock has been a fierce critic of the government\u2019s handling of the crisis at Tata Steel, which employs 15,000 people including about 4,000 at the Port Talbot plant in south Wales. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, arrived in Mumbai on Wednesday to meet Tata\u2019s bosses a week after Kinnock travelled to the city to lobby the Indian conglomerate when Javid was on a trip to Australia. Javid is now trying to help broker a purchase of the business, possibly with government support for the buyer. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Today programme, Kinnock said: \u201cIt\u2019s very good that Sajid Javid has finally found his way to Mumbai. The proposals Mr Gupta has outlined are very interesting indeed. I\u2019m going to be meeting with him very soon \u2026 But there are quite interesting ideas bubbling under and we need to make sure we don\u2019t rush to something because the government is in such a shambles.\u201d Read the full story here. European markets continue to rise, with the FTSE 100 up 0.5% at 6,122.42. The index of leading UK shares is being boosted by some upbeat news from China and a rebounding oil price (Brent crude oil is currently up 2.3% at $38.73 a barrel). But it is also benefitting from the expectation that Pfizer is about to walk away from its $160bn merger with Allergan. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, explains: A jump in the price of oil and surprisingly positive service sector data from China has helped lift European shares off three-week lows on Wednesday. Reports that the Allergan-Pfizer merger has been terminated has counter-intuitively sparked buying in other UK and Irish pharmaceutical groups. Speculation that Pfizer will look for another partner in its quest to relocate its headquarters and lower its tax burden has sent the shares of Shire and AstraZeneca flying. Best selling cars in the UK in March: Ford Fiesta Vauxhall Corsa Ford Focus Volkswagen Golf Nissan Qashqai Volkswagen Polo Vauxhall Astra Mini Fiat 500 Audi A3 Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, has issued a note of caution on UK new car sales, which have seemed unstoppable in recent years. He suggests consumer appetite will start to wane, with a knock-on effect for the wider economy. The key drivers of the recovery in car sales are weakening. Unsecured borrowing costs, while still falling, are not declining as sharply as they did in 2015. Meanwhile, consumer confidence has deteriorated this year and the intensification of the fiscal squeeze in the new fiscal year, which began this week, likely will depress sentiment further. Car sales contributed 0.3 percentage points to the 2.8% year-over-year rise in overall household spending in 2015, so this slowdown will be discernible in the headline consumption numbers. Phil Harrold, PwC\u2019s automotive leader, is much more upbeat: Today\u2019s figures reflect continuing business and consumer confidence, which will undoubtedly be boosted following the recent motor friendly budget that saw no changes to vehicle excise duty and fuel duty frozen for a sixth year. Business users continue to replenish fleets as more economical vehicles become available and consumers continue to access the very cheap finance deals that show no signs of abating. Of particular interest is the growth of alternatively fuelled vehicles as technology becomes more advanced but, more crucially, consumer acceptance levels rise. New car sales rose by 5.3% to 518,707 in March, boosted by the fact it was a plate change month. It was the best ever month since the bi-annual plate change was introduced in 1999, according to figures published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. It rounded off a record quarter, with more than 770,000 new cars registered between January and March. That was a 5.1% increase compared with the same period in 2015. Consumers have been attracted by cheap car finance deals, as well as lower emission vehicles with lower running costs. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT welcomed the increase in sales but warned consumer confidence could be undermined \u201cby political or economic uncertainty\u201d. There is a 35-40% chance that the UK will vote to leave the EU on 23 June, according to analysts at IHS. They point out that it would take two years to actually exit following the referendum, but what is unknown is whether the process of Brexit would be \u201csoft\u201d or \u201chard\u201d. And this would have broader implications for the performance of the UK economy. The most favourable outcome to a vote for the United Kingdom to exit the European Union would be what IHS terms a \u201csoft\u201d exit. Under this scenario, the UK would conduct amicable and constructive negotiations with the EU resulting in full trade agreements and full UK access to the European Single Market. On the migration front, the UK would attract highly skilled workers, perhaps through the adoption of a points system as used by Australia. A reduction in the number of less skilled workers coming into the country would have an upward impact on UK earnings; though, this scenario would also hurt the UK\u2019s competitiveness by putting upward pressure on unit labour costs, IHS says. Under a \u201chard\u201d exit scenario, the exit could be contentious and lengthy. The UK would struggle markedly over the short and longer term and would find itself excluded from, or having limited access to, the European Single Market. With the UK having limited access to the European Single Market and struggling for trade agreements, there would be significantly lower levels of new foreign direct investment. The City of London\u2019s position would be compromised and it would lose appreciable business to Frankfurt and Paris. Finally, under this scenario, the UK\u2019s migration policy would result in a lack of incoming workers needed for lesser-skilled jobs, and the resultant reduced workforce would limit potential UK growth. More reaction on those better than expected German industrial production numbers... Jonathan Loynes, Capital Economics: February\u2019s surprisingly small fall in German industrial production offers hope of a pick-up in GDP growth in the first quarter. But it is too early to conclude that the eurozone\u2019s main growth engine is now firing on all cylinders. Overall, an encouraging set of figures, given the importance of the German industrial sector. But with other evidence still downbeat, not least on the all-important consumer sector, there is little here to point to a broader upturn either in Germany or the currency union as a whole. Carsten Brzeski, ING: Another disappointment. German industrial production posted the expected decline in February, providing further evidence that the economy\u2019s former backbone has become weak. Only the construction sector remains an almost inexhaustible source of growth. Industrial production has become a kind of problem child over the last months. Despite tentative signs of stabilisation, industrial production has stagnated for a long while. Still, there are some tender rays of hope at the end of the tunnel: the recent drop in inventories combined with a pick up in corporate loans and capacity utilization at the highest level since end-2011 suggests that it is too early, yet, to give up on the German industry. In Germany, official figures showed industrial output fell by 0.5% in February, compared with January. While that doesn\u2019t sound like great news, it was a far better result than the 1.8% drop economists polled by Reuters were expecting. Andreas Scheuerle, economist at Dekabank, said: Looking at January and February together, the picture is looking bright. Industrial production is pointing upward. But nobody should take this as a sure-fire success for the rest of the year. The problems on global sales markets are not solved yet. Scheuerle said the data pointed to German growth of 0.5% in the first quarter. The industrial output data was also a welcome relief following shockingly poor figures for industrial orders, published on Tuesday. Orders had been expected to increase by 0.2% in February, but instead fell by 1.2%. In corporate news, the largest pharmaceuticals merger in history appears to be on the rocks. It is thought the $160bn (\u00a3113bn) deal between US giant Pfizer (best known for Viagra) and Dublin based Allergan (Botox producer) could be abandoned after the US government took new steps to clamp down on tax avoidance deals. The US Treasury proposed new rules on Monday, which would make so-called tax inversion deals - where companies relocate their headquarters to countries with a lower tax rate - less financially appealing. We will bring you official confirmation once we have it. In the meantime, read our full story on events so far here. The FTSE 100 has opened up 0.4% or 22 points at 6,113. All other major European indices have also opened higher. Oil prices rose from one-month lows as traders pinned their hopes on exporters agreeing to freeze production. US crude futures jumped by more than a dollar, or almost 3%, to a high of $36.92 a barrel. Brent crude is up 1.6% at $38.48 a barrel. Business activity in China\u2019s services sector increased in March on stronger demand, according to the latest PMI survey. The Caixin China general services PMI came in at 52.2 in March, up from 51.2 in February. Anything above 50 indicates growth. That has eased fears over the outlook in China, supporting the view that the economy is stabilising. Here is what\u2019s been happening in Asia... Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets and business. Asian investors were in a brighter mood today than their counterparts in the US and Europe yesterday. The Nikkei has closed down just 0.1% at 15,715.36, while the Hang Seng was up 0.1% at 20,203.45. That compared with sharper falls in the US and Europe on Tuesday, as investors became jittery following (another) warning from the IMF about the fragile state of the global economy, and weak eurozone data. Asian investors were encouraged by an improvement in China\u2019s services sector (more to follow), and a rebound in oil prices.",

A reduction in the number of less skilled workers coming into the country would have an upward impact on UK earnings; though, this scenario would also hurt the UK\u2019s competitiveness by putting upward pressure on unit labour costs, IHS says.</p> <p>Under a \u201chard\u201d exit scenario, the exit could be contentious and lengthy. The UK would struggle markedly over the short and longer term and would find itself excluded from, or having limited access to, the European Single Market. With the UK having limited access to the European Single Market and struggling for trade agreements, there would be significantly lower levels of new foreign direct investment. </p> <p>The City of London\u2019s position would be compromised and it would lose appreciable business to Frankfurt and Paris.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Liberty House, the company that could save the British steel industry from collapse, began in a Cambridge student\u2019s dormitory room. Its founder, Sanjeev Gupta, was thrown out of residential halls at Trinity for registering a private business there, which breached the college\u2019s charitable status. Two decades later, the company has annual revenues of almost $5bn (\u00a33.6bn). Gupta is now trying to buy Tata\u2019s UK steel operations, and if he is successful it could save thousands of jobs across the country. Gupta, 44, was born in Punjab, north India, in the early 1970s. His father, who had left school at 11, was a successful industrialist and businessman at a time when the socialist policies of Indira Gandhi were stirring unrest in the country. When Gupta was still a toddler, drought and an oil crisis brought the economy to its knees. Strikes and protests led to the government declaring a state of emergency, which lasted three years. Amid the chaos of those years, Gupta\u2019s father decided to send his son to the UK for schooling. At 12, Gupta left India and became a boarder at St Edmund\u2019s College in Canterbury. Everything in Britain was new and unfamiliar. Gupta scraped through his A-levels, and worked briefly for his father\u2019s business selling bicycles in Turkey before accepting an offer to study economics at Trinity College, Cambridge. It was there he began a business selling chemical products to Nigeria, an activity which got him into trouble repeatedly with the college dean. Even when he was student, Gupta\u2019s business was generating \u00a31m a day. He switched to study economics and business management instead, which was, in his words, a \u201cdoddle\u201d and freed up time to work on his startup. After graduating in 1995, Gupta began trading commodities around the world. With a phone glued to his ear, he rarely took a day off. Alongside his growing financial success, Gupta started a relationship with a woman from Essex. His strict family values meant he kept the relationship a secret for eight years, but she is now his wife. Gupta is one of a string of Indian-born steel tycoons who have seen potential in the UK steel industry in the last decade. As Tata backs out on its investments, Gupta remains optimistic. In an article in India Global magazine he wrote: \u201cThe recovery of domestic and international demand will certainly come, it\u2019s only a question of time.\u201d The businessman has taken bets on British steel in the past, reopening a Newport steel mill in October. He also stepped in last year to save almost 1,000 jobs in the Midlands when Lord Paul\u2019s Caparo steel empire folded, and has just concluded a deal to buy Tata\u2019s mothballed sites in Lanarkshire, Scotland. Gupta kept all the Newport workers on half their salary for two years while the facility was upgraded. His decision to step in and try to buy Tata\u2019s foundering assets could prove a shrewd move. Steel prices are at rock bottom, the government is doing all it can to facilitate the deal and the UK has a wealth of experienced steel workers who know the industry inside out. Gupta could be the man to revive British steel, but he would be getting a good deal out of it too.",

      "body": "<p>Liberty House, the company that could save the British steel industry from collapse, began in a Cambridge student\u2019s dormitory room. Its founder, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/05/steel-crisis-sanjeev-gupta-says-port-talbot-jobs-can-be-saved\">Sanjeev Gupta</a>, was thrown out of residential halls at Trinity for registering a private business there, which breached the college\u2019s charitable status.</p> <p>Two decades later, the company has annual revenues of almost $5bn (\u00a33.6bn). Gupta is now trying to buy Tata\u2019s UK steel operations, and if he is successful it could save thousands of jobs across the country.</p> <p>Gupta, 44, was born in Punjab, north India, in the early 1970s. His father, who had left school at 11, was a successful industrialist and businessman at a time when the socialist policies of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/indira-gandhi\">Indira Gandhi</a> were stirring unrest in the country.</p> <p>When Gupta was still a toddler, drought and an oil crisis brought the economy to its knees. Strikes and protests led to the government declaring a state of emergency, which lasted three years. </p> <p>Amid the chaos of those years, Gupta\u2019s father decided to send his son to the UK for schooling. At 12, Gupta left India and became a boarder at St Edmund\u2019s College in Canterbury. </p> <p>Everything in Britain was new and unfamiliar. Gupta scraped through his A-levels, and worked briefly for his father\u2019s business selling bicycles in Turkey before accepting an offer to study economics at Trinity College, Cambridge. </p> <p>It was there he began a business selling chemical products to Nigeria, an activity which got him into trouble repeatedly with the college dean.</p> <p>Even when he was student, Gupta\u2019s business was generating \u00a31m a day. He switched to study economics and business management instead, which was, in his words, a \u201cdoddle\u201d and freed up time to work on his startup.</p> <p>After graduating in 1995, Gupta began trading commodities around the world. With a phone glued to his ear, he rarely took a day off. </p> <p>Alongside his growing financial success, Gupta started a relationship with a woman from Essex. His strict family values meant he kept the relationship a secret for eight years, but she is now his wife. </p> <p>Gupta is one of a string of Indian-born steel tycoons who have seen potential in the UK steel industry in the last decade. As Tata backs out on its investments, Gupta remains optimistic. In an article in India Global magazine he wrote: \u201cThe recovery of domestic and international demand will certainly come, it\u2019s only a question of time.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/24/why-liberty-sees-a-future-for-the-steel-industry-in-britain\">The businessman has taken bets on British steel in the past</a>, reopening a Newport steel mill in October. He also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/liberty-steel-buying-caparo-advanced-engineering-business\">stepped in last year to save almost 1,000 jobs in the Midlands</a> when Lord Paul\u2019s Caparo steel empire folded, and has just concluded a deal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/24/tata-scottish-steel-works-rescued-by-liberty-house\">to buy Tata\u2019s mothballed sites in Lanarkshire, Scotland</a>. Gupta kept all the Newport workers on half their salary for two years while the facility was upgraded. </p> <p>His decision to step in and try to buy Tata\u2019s foundering assets could prove a shrewd move. Steel prices are at rock bottom, the government is doing all it can to facilitate the deal and the UK has a wealth of experienced steel workers who know the industry inside out. </p> <p>Gupta could be the man to revive British steel, but he would be getting a good deal out of it too. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The protracted weakness of the global economy has highlighted the need for lower taxes on employment and higher public spending to get the unemployed back into work, the International Monetary Fund has said. Expressing concern about sluggish growth in the west since the 2008-09 downturn, the Washington-based IMF said it was time for ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing to be accompanied by a range of structural reforms. The IMF issued its advice in a chapter from the half-yearly World Economic Outlook (WEO) released before the report\u2019s publication next week. Romain Duval and Davide Furceri, economists from the IMF\u2019s research department, said: \u201cIn the current environment of persistent weak economic activity in many advanced economies, there is a strong case for product and labour market reforms, complemented by macroeconomic policy support, to boost jobs and growth.\u201d The chapter from the WEO said an example of product market reform would be to make it easier for new firms to break into markets such as retailing and professional services. Labour market reforms included higher public spending to help the jobless find work, cutting unemployment benefits to encourage the jobless to take low-paid work, cutting taxes on employment, and making it easier for employers to hire and fire full-time staff. Duval and Furceri said there were short- and medium-term benefits to reforms of product markets. \u201cThey boost private investment and hiring as new firms enter into the market, and this effect does not depend markedly on overall economic conditions. For example, the widespread deregulation of air transport and telecommunications that took place in many advanced economies mostly during the 1990s led to large increases in output, productivity and quality of services.\u201d However, they added that some of the proposed changes to labour markets would work only under the right conditions. Policymakers should choose their priorities carefully, carry out the reforms in the right sequences, and make sure they are accompanied by enough economic stimulus to maximise gains. Cutting taxes on labour and higher spending on helping the unemployed into work had more effect when economies were struggling. \u201cIn contrast, reforms to employment protection arrangements and unemployment benefit systems have positive effects in good times, but can weaken aggregate demand and further lower output in bad times.\u201d Where possible, the IMF economists said, less generous unemployment benefits and lower job protection should be accompanied by other policies to offset their short-term cost. \u201cAlternatively, they might be enacted now but come into force only when the recovery is more robust, or be applied only to new beneficiaries \u2014 so-called \u2018grandfathering\u2019 of reforms,\u201d they said.",

      "bodyText": "It was poised to be the biggest pharmaceuticals merger ever. Pfizer, the company responsible for Viagra, was to hook up with Botox maker Allergan in a deal worth $160bn (\u00a3114bn). That was before Barack Obama got involved. Earlier this week, the US Treasury announced it was to tighten up its corporate tax laws to deter mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) activity motivated by the desire to pay less tax. Within 48 hours, the mega deal was history, and a good thing too. Here\u2019s what has been happening. By international standards, the US has a high rate of corporation tax. To avoid paying rates of up to 39%, American companies have come up with a scheme known as tax inversion. They look for a likely partner based in a country with a lower corporate tax regime and suggest a merger. When the merger goes through, the company based in the US moves its HQ \u2013 but not the bulk of its operations \u2013 to the low-tax jurisdiction, where it books the bulk of its profits. At a stroke, the company\u2019s tax bill is cut. Obama has clearly had enough of this. He has instructed the US Treasury to crack down on \u201cabusive\u201d inverters and it is not hard to see why. First, this is the perfect political moment to act. The president explicitly drew a link between the tax avoidance activities of US corporations and the details of how wealthy individuals have salted their billions in offshore tax havens revealed by the Panama Papers. Obama is surfing a wave of anger among ordinary Americans. Second, there are economic costs to the US from these sorts of deals, as Obama rightly noted. If corporations are paying less tax, only one of two things can happen. The US will have less to spend on schools, roads and public health, or taxes will have to be raised on the country\u2019s middle class. Finally, the urge to reduce the tax bill seems to have been more important than the business logic to the deal, despite Pfizer\u2019s protestations at the time it was announced. It would be different if it could be showed that companies were recycling the money they were saving into much higher levels of research and development spending that would provide a new generation of life-saving drugs. There is always talk on these occasions of how the proposed merger creates positive synergy, with great benefits to consumers and employees. That\u2019s bunk, though. The real beneficiaries of mergers tend to be executives, who see the value of their shares go up, and the bankers who collect large fees for arranging the deals. Let\u2019s face it: if the business case was so compelling, the deal would not have been derailed by a less generous tax regime. Get to the chopper: why Japan\u2019s voucher fantasy needs grounding Imagine that the world economy takes a turn for the worse and slips back into recession. Central banks double down on their quantitative easing programmes. That doesn\u2019t increase growth or bring an end to deflation. They push interest rates deep into negative territory. That doesn\u2019t work either. At this point, politicians opt for the helicopter money approach. That\u2019s where central banks print money so that finance ministries can hand it out to citizens in the hope that they will go out and spend the unexpected windfall. If this all sounds like the realms of fantasy, think again. Helicopter money is closer than you think. The Japanese government is toying with the idea of distributing shopping vouchers to all households, which they could use for childcare or other spending. This is helicopter money in all but name. The vouchers are similar to those handed out by UK supermarkets to customers that accumulate points on their loyalty cards. They expire unless they are used within an allotted period. The big question is whether vouchers actually work. In a perfect world, the extra consumer spending would kickstart recovery and become self-reinforcing through a pickup in investment. That, though, was not the experience of Japan the last time it tried the idea at the end of the 1990s and, according to Capital Economics, it might not do the trick this time either. That\u2019s because the Japanese government is planning an increase in sales tax next year, and the likelihood is that consumers will simply spend more in 2016 and then rein back in 2017. The moral for Tokyo is that vouchers will only work if the tax increases are shelved. They probably will be.",

      "bodyText": "The UK has recorded its biggest monthly car sales in almost 20 years, with more than 500,000 new vehicles registered in March. The figures, regarded as a barometer of economic confidence, are up 5.3% on March last year, making it the busiest month for traders since twice-yearly number plate changes were introduced in 1999. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) ascribed the record sales to a combination of consumer confidence, low interest rates and new technology. The British-based manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by Tata, achieved its best retail month in the UK, selling more than 25,000 vehicles, up 16% year-on-year. Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe sector\u2019s strong growth in March rounds off a robust first quarter as British consumers continue to demonstrate their appetite for new cars, especially ultra-low emission vehicles. This confidence should see registrations remain at a high but broadly stable level over the year, but could be undermined by political or economic uncertainty.\u201d The major uncertainty, he said, was the EU referendum, with motor manufacturers having recently joined forces to warn against the possibility of Brexit. Hawes said that for now, economic indicators such as low interest rates, rising house prices and low unemployment were aiding confidence and sales. \u201cFinancing is an important factor, with low interest rates and fixed plans. Consumers appreciate the certainty on how much they are paying for their cars.\u201d New technology was also driving sales, Hawes said. \u201cThere are a few new models out there, which tend to be more fuel efficient. And people do want the connected technology. Young people in particular want features like syncing phones with the car.\u201d Forty-three consecutive months of sales growth came to an end last year, but Britain\u2019s car market has remained more buoyant than in much of the rest of Europe, where trade remains below pre-recession levels. Sue Robinson, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, said the sector was \u201cin a good position for 2016\u201d. Sales to private customers rose by 3.8%, and business fleet sales increased 6% after slight declines earlier in the year. Sales of electric cars and other alternatively fuelled vehicles rose 21.5% from last March, although they represent fewer than 3% of total sales. Volkswagen, whose sales had fallen amid the diesel emissions scandal, halted the trend in March, with a fractional increase on last year. Sales for the year to date, however, are still almost 5% below the same period in 2015, following its admission that it had fitted \u201cdefeat devices\u201d in certain diesel engines to rig tests. About one in seven of the cars sold in the UK is made in the country, with volumes expected to rise until 2020 after recent investment. Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u2019s largest automotive manufacturer, said its two brands had combined to sell 25,127 vehicles, with Jaguar reporting its strongest UK sales in more than a decade.",

      "bodyText": "The largest pharmaceuticals merger in history, between Pfizer and Allergan, has been abandoned after the US government took fresh steps to clamp down on tax avoidance deals. The $160bn (\u00a3113bn) deal, announced in November, was thrown into doubt following the move by the US Treasury on Monday to make so-called tax inversion deals, by which corporations relocate their headquarters to countries with a lower tax rate, less financially appealing. The companies said on Wednesday that the deal had been terminated \u201cby mutual agreement,\u201d a decision \u201cdriven by the actions announced by the U.S. Department of Treasury on April 4, 2016, which the companies concluded qualified as an \u201cAdverse Tax Law Change\u201d under the merger agreement.\u201d Shares in Botox producer Allergan crashed nearly 20% in after-hours trading on Monday , following speculation that the deal would be affected by the US government move. Barack Obama called on Congress to close \u201cone of the most insidious tax loopholes out there\u201d, saying it shortchanges the country. The president said less tax revenue meant less spending on schools, transportation networks and other investments. He said the practice also hurts middle-class Americans because \u201cthat lost revenue has to be made up somewhere\u201d. \u201cWhen companies exploit loopholes like this it makes it harder to invest in the things that are going to keep America\u2019s economy going strong for future generations,\u201d Obama said. Under the deal Pfizer intended to re-domicile from its headquarters in New York to Ireland. Allergan moved its head office to Dublin after a reverse merger with the Irish drugmaker Actavis a year ago. The US tax inversion rules also scuppered US drugs group AbbVie\u2019s $54bn takeover of Britain\u2019s Shire in 2014. AbbVie pulled out of the agreed deal after a detailed examination of the rules, and concluded they made Shire less valuable to AbbVie. John Colley, a professor at Warwick Business School, said: \u201cThe stock market thinks that the US government is likely to be successful with this move. Several pharmaceutical deals are based on similar tax benefits. \u201cIndeed this move may well prevent recent tax inversion deals altogether. If so, US businesses will have to rely on more conventional benefits to justify their overseas merger plans. Pfizer may terminate the deal or alternatively renegotiate a lower price. Certainly their shareholders will not now be happy with the terms of the original deal.\u201d Pfizer chief executive Ian Read has made no secret of his desire to split the company into two parts, one comprising patented-protected innovative drugs and the other with older products that have come off patent or are close to it. The two drugmakers agreed either party may terminate the deal if a change in US law would cause the combined company to be treated as a domestic corporation for federal income tax purposes.",

      "bodyText": "Cyan, an Aim-listed minnow, has seen its shares more than double after unveiling an order bigger than its market value before the deal. The smart metering company has received an order from Iran worth \u00a310m for 360,000 units, after an initial testing period earlier in the year. Its shares have jumped 115% to 0.28p, with its market capitalisation soaring from \u00a39.4m to \u00a319m. Cyan said: The order [from telecommunications contractor Micromodje] is significantly larger than any purchase order received to date by Cyan and marks a step change in the company\u2019s commercial progress. This is one of the first substantial deals secured by a UK company since sanctions were lifted on Iran in January. Iran plans to replace electricity meters for all customers - around 33m meters - within seven years. Cyan executive chairman John Cronin said: Not only is the order ten times larger than any previous orders we have received, but this Iranian order also marks Cyan\u2019s entry into a new territory. Analyst Adam Forsyth at the company\u2019s broker Cantor Fitzgerald issued a buy note with a 1p price target, saying: We think that the rapid follow up to the pilot order announced in February shows that Cyan\u2019s product is easy to deploy and is delivering its expected benefits. We think the company is beginning to gain real market traction, de-risking our investment case. The shipment and installation of hardware will begin towards the end of the current year following integration of Cyan\u2019s hardware with a locally manufactured smart meter. Hardware revenue will be recognised as it is delivered over a two year period. The software licence income will be recognised over a five year initial contract period following successful meter installation and paid annually in advance on a per meter per year basis. This will deliver a recurring revenue stream beyond the initial hardware sales and potentially beyond the initial contract period. [There is] a larger market opportunity \u2013 Iran has begun a national smart metering program (FAHAM in Persian) with the stated goal of replacing approximately 33m meters in seven years and with funding from the state-owned power company. Cyan has already entered into a dialogue with Micromodje on the next planned rollout of 1m smart meters. On a pro-rata basis such a deal could be worth \u00a328m and the total market of 33m units worth up to \u00a3920m. We see delays in securing sales orders as the biggest risk to [our] valuation. Today\u2019s announcement helps to reduce that risk. Order conversion risk here will depend on continuing diplomatic rapprochement with Iran but this does not detract from the endorsement of Cyan\u2019s technology that this deal represents in our view.",

Nic Budden\u2019s basic wage for this year will be \u00a3550,000, up from \u00a3461,250 in 2015, while his maximum bonus will rise from 125% of salary to a maximum of 150%. Including bonuses and share incentive payments, Budden\u2019s total pay packet could hit \u00a32.3m for this year compared with the \u00a3856,000 he was given last year. Chairman Andrew Adcock said the company\u2019s pay committee \u201crecognises that an increase of this magnitude is unusual\u201d but said the hefty rise was agreed upon after \u201ccareful consideration and consultation with key shareholders\u201d. Budden\u2019s pay rise, revealed in the estate agent\u2019s annual report, came despite a difficult year in which the company was affected by a fall in the number of transactions in the London housing market. The slowdown saw the company\u2019s shares slump 33% from 1 June until the end of the year, while it recorded a 3% fall in pre-tax profit to \u00a340m. But Foxtons said Budden still deserved the 19% pay rise because he had been historically underpaid. Budden moved up from the chief operating officer role when Michael Brown moved aside for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d after 12 years with the company, seven of them at its helm. Budden\u2019s potential 2016 cash-plus-shares deal could be worth up to \u00a32.3m, a 700% increase on the \u00a3327,000 he got in 2014, when he became chief executive halfway through the year. Foxtons hinted that its decision to promote from within had allowed the company to set his pay at a comparatively low level while he got used to the top job. \u201cWhen the CEO was appointed to the board in July 2014, his remuneration was set at relatively low levels,\u201d said Adcock. \u201cThis was deemed acceptable by both the CEO and the board as he adapted and grew into the enlarged role. \u201cSince then the CEO has demonstrated strong leadership and has handled well the increasing complexity and size of the business.\u201d He added that Budden was very valuable to the business and that his pay had been compared against those of executives with similar experience. Foxtons also used its annual report to warn that it could suffer if Britain votes to leave the EU. The London-focused estate agent said a vote to leave could damage the capital\u2019s position as a financial centre. \u201cThe market may also be affected by any reduction in London\u2019s standing as a major financial city caused by a decision by the UK to leave the EU,\u201d the company said.",

      "bodyText": "As markets recover some ground following better than expected Chinese data and a revival in the oil price, easyJet shares have hit some turbulence. The budget airline is down 33p or 2% at \u00a314.89 after it reported a 4.3% rise in March passenger numbers to 5.7m compared to the same time last year. But this represented slightly slower growth than in recent months and the load factor - the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available - fell from 92.6% a year ago to 91.3%. It said there were a number of cancellations during the month - 611 in all - mainly due to strikes in France. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: While easyJet points to French strikes as a mitigating factor for March weakness, it is interesting to note that Ryanair did too and yet it still managed to post steady growth in both passenger numbers and loads. Overall the FTSE 100 has climbed 30.54 points to 6121.77, with Shire leading the way, up 120p to \u00a341.69. The pharmaceuticals group has been under pressure on fears that the US tax inversion rules which has scuppered Pfizer\u2019s deal to buy Allegan could damage Shire\u2019s merger with Baxalta. But analysts at Credit Suisse said: Shire has publically stated that they expect an ultimate group tax rate for [the merged company] of around 16.5%, some 3.5 percentage points below where we see the blended rate for the two standalone companies (20%). If we assume that profits from sales/costs synergies are taxed at 20%, and that the regular tax shield on additional debt is also at 20%, this implies other tax benefits of up to $260m by 2020 to get to the 16.5% group rate. If we assume that these extra savings are at risk from heightened US tax scrutiny this would reduce our proforma 2020 earnings per share from $7.05 to $6.76. These assumptions would delay accretion from 2017 to 2019 and move 2020 earnings per share accretion from 10% to 5%. With Shire being an Irish tax domiciled company we are not clear to what extent these rules may be important. But we do not see the possible loss of this level of tax as likely to derail management\u2019s strong desire to complete the transaction. We believe that Shire trades at an unwarranted discount to peers reflecting uncertainty around the scale of the Baxalta transaction, and general biotech derating, despite expected double digit 5 year earnings per share growth. Meanwhile Bank of America/Merrill Lynch analysts suggested Shire itself could be a target following the collapse of the Pfizer-Allergan deal. AstraZeneca has also moved higher, adding 102p to \u00a340.53 on suggestions Pfizer could now look for another partner. Elsewhere Glencore has edged up 0.1p to 142.15p as it unveiled plans to sell a 40% stake in its agricultural business to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $2.5bn. Other mining shares benefitted from the positive Chinese service sector data, which for the moment eased some of the fears of a major slowdown in the world\u2019s second largest economy. Antofagasta has added 10.3p to 443p while Anglo American is up 4.9p at 530.6p. Among the retailers Next has added 100p to \u00a353.50 as Haitong Research moved from sell to buy. Analyst Tony Shiret said: Our overwhelming reaction to the [recent] results is of surprise that management appeared to have relatively few solutions. Even the terms used to describe the travails of the UK Directory spoke to a business that has moved from being amenable to management inputs/levers to one more or less reactive to market conditions. In a sense that is the issue here. There is plenty of opportunity to be exposed to beta in the General Retail sector but alpha is rare. Next has drifted out of the exclusive club. We have made modest reductions to profit forecasts which now assume full deployment of \u201csurplus\u201d cashflow to buy-backs. Our Fair Value is reduced by 2% from 6000p to 5900p reflecting Haitong earnings per share forecast changes. Having said this, the outcome is largely as we expected. We have made modest downgrades and the shares are down 30% price relative over four months and now stand on a comparable valuation to M&amp;S. So long as the margin structure holds at Next we feel they offer decent value and have upgraded from sell to buy. We believe that the new news here has now been discounted into the share price. Clearly there is scope for further newsflow to develop. But on the basis of what we have seen we are now much happier that investors understand the structural issues facing this company.",

      "bodyText": "Losses at Tata Steel have halved from the previously reported \u00a31m a day, giving weight to management\u2019s claims that it can turn the business around, the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said. Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency is home to Tata\u2019s Port Talbot plant, said the government should not rush into backing the wrong deal for the business, which Tata put up for sale last week. He welcomed the interest of metals magnate Sanjeev Gupta in a possible rescue plan but was doubtful about Gupta\u2019s proposal to replace Port Talbot\u2019s giant steelmaking blast furnace with an operation built around recycling scrap steel. Kinnock has been a fierce critic of the government\u2019s handling of the crisis at Tata Steel, which employs 15,000 people including about 4,000 at the Port Talbot plant in south Wales. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, arrived in Mumbai on Wednesday to meet Tata\u2019s bosses a week after Kinnock travelled to the city to lobby the Indian conglomerate when Javid was on a trip to Australia. Javid is now trying to help broker a purchase of the business, possibly with government support for the buyer. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Today programme, Kinnock said: \u201cIt\u2019s very good that Sajid Javid has finally found his way to Mumbai. The proposals Mr Gupta has outlined are very interesting indeed. I\u2019m going to be meeting with him very soon \u2026 But there are quite interesting ideas bubbling under and we need to make sure we don\u2019t rush to something because the government is in such a shambles.\u201d Tata has indicated it will give the government weeks and not months to find a buyer for its troubled UK business, which was said to be losing \u00a31m a day. But Kinnock said, after talks with unions on Tuesday, he believed that figure overestimated Tata Steel\u2019s plight. \u201cWe need to start challenging that figure. It was something that emerged in the autumn. [The loss] has gone down by at least 50% from what it was and is moving in the right direction. It\u2019s a big challenge \u2013 no one is denying that \u2013 but there are opportunities for a fresh start.\u201d He said a management plan rejected by Tata last week had emerged as a serious contender if the government came up with support measures. Kinnock did not say what had caused Tata Steel\u2019s losses to come down. Tata has cut jobs at Port Talbot and other plants, and management has been implementing other efficiency measures as part of a turnaround plan. The pound\u2019s sharp fall may also have helped support export sales. He was doubtful about Gupta\u2019s proposal to scrap Port Talbot\u2019s blast furnace in favour of arc furnaces to recycle scrap steel. He said the blast furnace was technologically advanced and its energy could be reused for other purposes. Without the blast furnace, production would be cut drastically and jobs would be threatened despite Gupta\u2019s assurance that he would seek to keep on all workers at Port Talbot.",

Javid is now trying to help broker a purchase of the business, possibly with government support for the buyer.</p> <p>Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Today programme, Kinnock said: \u201cIt\u2019s very good that Sajid Javid has finally found his way to Mumbai. The proposals Mr Gupta has outlined are very interesting indeed. I\u2019m going to be meeting with him very soon \u2026 But there are quite interesting ideas bubbling under and we need to make sure we don\u2019t rush to something because the government is in such a shambles.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"86737f73fd0ea2d8a022c79af3a120fe295c24f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86737f73fd0ea2d8a022c79af3a120fe295c24f8/0_482_4711_2828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labour MP Stephen Kinnock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour MP Stephen Kinnock.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tata has indicated it will give the government weeks and not months to find a buyer for its troubled UK business, which was said to be losing \u00a31m a day. But Kinnock said, after talks with unions on Tuesday, he believed that figure overestimated Tata Steel\u2019s plight.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to start challenging that figure. It was something that emerged in the autumn. [The loss] has gone down by at least 50% from what it was and is moving in the right direction. It\u2019s a big challenge \u2013 no one is denying that \u2013 but there are opportunities for a fresh start.\u201d </p> <p>He said a management plan rejected by Tata last week had emerged as a serious contender if the government came up with support measures.</p> <p>Kinnock did not say what had caused Tata Steel\u2019s losses to come down. Tata <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/18/tata-steel-last-attempt-revive-port-talbot\">has cut jobs at Port Talbot</a> and other plants, and management has been implementing other efficiency measures as part of a turnaround plan. The pound\u2019s sharp fall may also have helped support export sales.</p> <p>He was doubtful about Gupta\u2019s proposal to scrap Port Talbot\u2019s blast furnace in favour of arc furnaces to recycle scrap steel. He said the blast furnace was technologically advanced and its energy could be reused for other purposes. </p> <p>Without the blast furnace, production would be cut drastically and jobs would be threatened despite Gupta\u2019s assurance that he would seek to keep on all workers at Port Talbot.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sajid Javid flew to Mumbai on Tuesday night for talks with the Indian owner of Tata Steel in an attempt to win more time to secure the future of thousands of British jobs. The business secretary will hold talks with Cyrus Mistry, the chairman of Tata, after a day of crunch meetings in the UK. The talks ended with unions calling for Javid to ensure the Indian company does all it can to find a saviour for its UK sites. About 40,000 jobs are at risk after Tata announced last week it would sell its UK steel business, including the blast furnaces at Port Talbot, the biggest steelworks in the country. Javid held talks about a potential rescue deal for Tata\u2019s UK sites with Sanjeev Gupta, who runs the metals group Liberty House. He has become the most high-profile candidate to potentially buy the business after conducting a series of television and radio interviews. Gupta\u2019s plan is thought to involve replacing the blast furnaces at Port Talbot with electric arc furnaces that process scrap steel. However, this could take years and Gupta has indicated he would need significant financial support, with the government helping with Tata\u2019s pension liabilities of almost \u00a315bn and either cutting environmental taxes or subsidising power projects the tycoon is involved with. The government and unions have already indicated they would like to preserve the blast furnaces at Port Talbot, which make raw steel. Tata sources cast doubt about the prospect of Gupta being able to rescue its UK sites. They cautioned that the prospect of any rescue deal is \u201cslim\u201d. Tata is keen to sell the business to one buyer, rather than breaking up the business, one source said. A buyer for the entire business is likely to require \u201cmega bucks\u201d from the government to make Port Talbot viable, the source added. \u201cThey want to package the whole thing. They don\u2019t want to upset the unions,\u201d they said. Other parties are interested in rescuing the business. These include Greybull, the investment firm, and ThyssenKrupp, the German industrial conglomerate. Speaking after his meeting with Javid, Gupta said: \u201cI am pleased to report that we had a positive meeting today. UK government appears highly supportive and is proactively engaged in finding a long-term solution. \u201cThe next step is for Tata to define the formal sales process and request indications of interest from potential buyers. We await further details on this and then will assess our own next step.\u201d Gupta has pledged to avoid widespread job losses if he manages to buy the business. Trade unions have welcomed Gupta\u2019s interest but said it is too early to judge the merits of potential bidders. Union leaders met with Javid after he spoke to Liberty, when they urged him to secure guarantees from Mistry in Mumbai and also warned against a breakup of the business. Tony Burke, assistant general secretary at Unite, said it had been a \u201cpositive meeting\u201d. He added: \u201cThe unions made clear that we want him to go to India and make it clear that we need time to put together a deal. We are looking for the whole of Tata to be purchased by one buyer. We are against a breakup.\u201d Javid confirmed that Liberty is not the only company to show interest. \u201cIt\u2019s great that this interest is out there,\u201d he said. The business secretary said a meeting with David Cameron and Labour\u2019s Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, had also been constructive. Jones said his message to Cameron during the meeting, which was also attended by George Osborne, had been: \u201cThese plants cannot close.\u201d He told the Guardian that pulling out of the European Union would result in high tariffs on British steel and would \u201cfurther undermine\u201d the country\u2019s steel industry. He said that in their talks Cameron had told him that the government was prepared to step in to help the sale of Tata\u2019s assets. Jones said the prime minister \u201crecognised that work needs to be done on pension liability, on increasing tariffs and high energy prices\u201d. He also said ministers had admitted that losing the steel industry would be a security threat because of the need to produce equipment for the military. \u201cThere will need to be action from the UK government in order to make a sale more attractive. We were surprised by the timescale of weeks,\u201d added Jones. \u201cTata have confirmed that all their assets will be in a saleable position. I don\u2019t think they will want to surrender that reputation for corporate social responsibility.\u201d On Europe, he added: \u201cWhat we do know is that if we weren\u2019t in the EU we\u2019d have enormous tariffs on British steel. We wouldn\u2019t be able to compete with steel producers outside Europe. If there were any barriers to that market [it would] undermine the steel industry further.\u201d It would be \u201cfinancially daft\u201d to pull out of the EU and expect it to help the industry, Jones said. The Welsh first minister insisted that the steel market would improve and get back on track for British companies, saying they needed to just \u201cget over this difficult\u201d period. The comments were echoed by Luis Sanz, the head of Celsa, the second largest steel company in Britain, who said the Chinese were trying to dominate the industry for decades. He warned the UK would not be able to rebuild its capability in the industry if sites were lost. \u201cIt is true that there is an imbalance between steel production and demand at the moment, but it will come to an equilibrium and then whoever holds the production of steel will control the process,\u201d Celsa said.",
