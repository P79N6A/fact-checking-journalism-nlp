Sir Mervyn King's term does not expire until the end of June 2013, but speculation has already started swirling in the Square Mile about who will take over. Canadian central bank governor Mark Carney was forced to deny on Wednesday that he had been informally approached about the post. In a letter to George Osborne, Tyrie said, \"I am concerned that the process for selecting the next governor lacks clarity. The choice of the next governor will be perhaps the most important public appointment the government will make.\" When Alistair Darling was chancellor, he promised to make all appointments to the Bank of England under a new, open process, and vacancies on the monetary policy committee have since been advertised. But the coalition has stressed that it does not consider itself to be bound by that decision, and is as yet undecided about how the appointment will take place. Tyrie urged the chancellor to set out how he will make the appointment and repeated the committee's call to be given a veto over the government's choice of candidate. The cross-party group of MPs already carries out public hearings for new members of the MPC, though its judgments are not binding. The governorship of the Bank is a so-called \"Crown appointment\", with the government recommending a candidate who must be confirmed by the Queen. Tyrie said: \"Having an appointment made through the same system that we have had since the Bank was nationalised in 1946, which is a smoke and mirrors operation, is no longer tenable in the modern age.\" However, a Treasury insider said Tyrie's intervention was premature, insisting that speculation about the Bank appointment had not come from Whitehall, and pointing out that King still has a quarter of his term left to serve. King's successor will be one of the most powerful financial policymakers in the world as the Bank takes on responsibility for supervising the banking sector and safeguarding financial stability under the coalition's shakeup of financial regulation. Tyrie and his colleagues on the committee have made a series of criticisms about the new regulatory set-up, fearing that the Bank and its new governor, who will serve a single eight-year term, will become unassailable. Darling's Treasury had a notoriously rocky relationship with the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street, and King in particular, clashing over the emergency bailout of Northern Rock, which the governor initially warned would create \"moral hazard\" by rewarding reckless behaviour.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barclays is scrambling to head off a damaging revolt over the \u00a317m pay package awarded to its chief executive Bob Diamond by changing the terms of his bonus for last year \u2013 just days before a crucial shareholder vote. In an unscheduled announcement to the stock market that demonstrated its level of anxiety about a potential shareholder rebellion at next Friday's annual meeting, the bank also pledged to bolster dividends to try to address investors' concerns that it paid \u00a32.1bn in bonuses last year \u2013 more than three times the \u00a3700m used to pay shareholders' dividends. The surprise move came after the bank embarked on urgent canvassing of major investors earlier this week, asking them what could be done to limit the dissent prompted by Diamond's \u00a32.7m bonus. There has also been investor anger over the decision to pay a \u00a35.7m tax bill Diamond incurred when moving back to the UK from the US to become chief executive, after more than a decade running the investment bank Barclays Capital. The bank will now more closely link Diamond's bonus to return on equity, a measure of financial performance. Diamond's return-on-equity target is 13% \u2013 well above the 6.6% achieved for 2011, a figure he described as \"unacceptable\". Diamond will have half of his \u00a32.7m share award for 2011 linked to the return on equity in three years' time. Only if the bank's return on equity is greater than its cost of equity (11.5%) will he take that half of the bonus. The same will apply to the \u00a31.8m bonus awarded to finance director Chris Lucas. Until now, neither bonus had any performance criteria attached and would have been released, in shares, to both directors in three years' time. The bank immediately won round Standard Life, which owns 2% of Barclays shares. Guy Jubb, the investor's head of corporate governance, said: \"We now intend to support the remuneration report at next week's AGM.\" However, it was far from clear that other investors had been convinced so easily and Barclays could face a tense week while shareholders lodge their votes not only for the remuneration report but also for the re-election of Alison Carnwath, the non-executive who chairs the remuneration committee. \"Some are tempted to shift but most are not,\" one shareholder said. \"It's a bit late to be doing this if the company thinks this is such a good idea \u2013 and also it does not address the fundamental issues on pay.\" Investor advisory body Pirc kept its recommendation to vote against the remuneration report and Carnwath's re-election, arguing there should have been no bonus at all given the bank's performance. David Paterson, head of corporate governance at the influential National Association of Pension Funds, said it was a \"positive step\" but called on Barclays to \"engage with shareholders after the AGM in order to address the fundamental concerns which many have about the structure of executive pay\". The Association of British Insurers, whose members control a fifth of shares on the stock market, declined to comment on the changes. Last week it issued an \"amber top\" alert to its members, highlighting its concerns about the bonuses of Diamond and Lucas. The ABI had previously pointed out that it was \"business as usual\" at the bank as the amount of revenues it had used to fund bonuses at Barclays Capital had remained static at 35% even though the bank had insisted bonuses were down 25% on the year. The bank appeared to attempt to address this, saying that it was \"fully committed to ensuring that a greater proportion of income and profits flow to shareholders notwithstanding that it operates within the constraints of a competitive market\". Barclays added that it had made no changes to the tax arrangements. Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott said: \"This shouldn't be enough to let them off the hook. What really sticks in the throat of taxpayers and investors is the blank cheque to cover his tax bills after his move from New York to London.\" The changes followed week of shareholder meetings led by chairman Marcus Agius and were \"recognising the strength of opinion expressed by some shareholders, via those meetings, and the executive directors' confidence in the future performance of the bank\", Barclays said. Sticking to its target for a 13% return on equity, the bank said: \"Achieving this target of 13% return on equity will allow the portion of post-tax profits that are distributed as dividends to normalise at a level much higher than today, and Barclays intends to continue to make steady progress towards that as the return on equity improves. The combination of higher earnings and a higher dividend payout ratio will allow a significant increase in the absolute level of dividends received by shareholders\". \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 20 April 2012",

      "bodyText": "Trenchcoat-maker Aquascutum is shutting down its factory in Corby with the loss of 115 jobs, after falling into administration earlier this week. The move prompted a furious response from the GMB trade union, which represents almost all of the factory's workers, and is considering mounting a legal challenge to the redundancies. The administrator, FRP Advisory, said it had conducted a detailed review of Aquascutum's financial position in the two days since it had been appointed. A spokesman said: \"Regrettably, it has been concluded that the company's manufacturing plant in Corby is not viable to continue to trade due to loss-making operations and a lack of funding. We have been forced to begin the shutdown process of the plant, with all 115 staff at the site made redundant with immediate effect. \"Whilst a difficult decision, it has been necessary in order to stem ongoing losses for the business, and to protect the positions of the 135 remaining employees.\" Rachelle Wilkins of the GMB said she had been at the factory when the announcement was made. \"It's absolute devastation down there. There was an audible gasp around the room when the administrators said they would not get their wages next week.\" She said Aquascutum had breached statute law by not consulting on the redundancies and the GMB is now seeking legal advice on whether its members can get compensation. The administrators said the rest of Aquascutum's business would continue to operate as usual for the time being. FRP Advisory is hoping to find a buyer for the 160-year-old brand, whose trench coats have been worn by Cary Grant and Margaret Thatcher. Joint administrator Geoff Rowley said when FRP was appointed: \"Even this afternoon there has been serious interest in Aquascutum. We are well into double figures of people taking an interest.\" Two days later, the administrator said its focus was now on progressing discussions for a sale of the Aquascutum brand and assets. One possible buyer is Hong Kong-listed company, YGM, which holds the rights to sell Aquascutum products in the Asian market. It put out a statement on Tuesday saying the insolvency of Aquascutum \"may present an opportunity\" for YGM to expand its ownership of the brand worldwide. \"[YGM] is currently in its initial stage of discussion in relation to the possible acquisition of the rights relating to the Aquascutum brand outside the Asian Territories,\" it said, adding, \"The discussion may or may not proceed.\" The news of Aquascutum's factory closure clashed with research suggesting manufacturing could help lead the UK out of the downturn. Administrators Begbies Traynor tracks signs companies are in distress, such as legal actions and late account filing. It suggested distress levels at manufacturing companies fell by more than 50% in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, said: \"Manufacturing is the star of the economy at present and the engine that could drive a recovery.\" By contrast, the utilities sector, which includes contractors to local authorities, showed a 67% increase in signs of distress.",

      "bodyText": "Where is the world economy heading? The IMF, at its spring conference in Washington, says the prospect is for stronger growth as long as the Europeans, Americans and Chinese restrain their urge to make a complete hash of their domestic recoveries. Optimists make the point that most countries have stabilised and can provide a platform for private sector growth \u2013 if not this month then in the not-too-distant future. There are exceptions in Latin America, parts of Europe and Africa, where some countries have hit the buffers, but no enough to knock the momentum fostered by the US and supported by the Chinese. However, the interconnected nature of modern economies make them especially vulnerable to peripheral nations. Like a black hole in a far-flung part of the Milky Way, Spain in particular has the capacity to suck in and destroy all around it. Recent figures from the US show an economy that is struggling to maintain last year's growth. Worse, it could run out of steam after the November presidential election. One crucial point, accepted by treasury secretary Tim Geithner, is the likelihood of a tax-receipt drought in 2013 if president Barack Obama is re-elected and cranks up tax on the rich. Already, wealthy Americans are accelerating their bonuses to benefit from this year's lower rates and preparing to delay further bonuses for several years. Even a Mitt Romney government could find itself strapped for cash next year after a surge in receipts during 2012. Much of the recent \"US miracle\" was also based on corporations building up their stocks over the winter, something that will not be repeated this year. Exports to China could save the day, although Albert Edwards, the much-respected head of global research at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, argues there is a good deal of complacency over Beijing's success. He falls firmly into the pessimist camp: China is heading for a hard landing, he says, with serious implications for its currency and world trade. On this analysis, the yuan, which has come under sustained criticism from the US for being overvalued, will fall. You might think this would please the US, except the reason for the fall will not be a rebalancing of China's economy away from exports but the bursting of a massive housing bubble and the appearance of huge bad loans on the books of domestic banks. Which brings us neatly back to Spain \u2013 which, after Ireland, had the most debilitating housing boom and declared on Wednesday that bad bank loans, much of it on empty or derelict property, had risen to more than 8%. There is concern that poorly performing bank loans will need to be indemnified by the government or be allowed to fail. Either way, it would cause havoc \u2013 and it is the fear of this outcome that keeps investors away. The Madrid stock market is down more than 15% in recent months and the cost of insuring bank loans has soared to record levels. The government succeeded in borrowing money on the private markets on Thursday, pushing through a \u20ac2.5bn sale of two- and 10-year bonds, but the sovereign debt market across the EU is underwritten by hundreds of billions of euros supplied by the European Central Bank. Figures show more than \u20ac200bn of Spanish debt is owned by Spanish banks, which means that problems in the private sector will quickly feed through into the public and vice versa. And Spain is paying unsustainably high interest rates to get the loans. It shows that fear still lurks in the international money markets, and that plenty of fund managers are betting something is about to go badly wrong.",

    "webTitle": "IMF chief Christine Lagarde in last-ditch struggle to raise funds", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Christine Lagarde is involved in a struggle to raise funds for the International Monetary Fund amid fears that a fresh eruption of the global financial crisis will leave the organisation short of emergency cash. The fund's managing director was lobbying hard for Britain and other developed nations that have yet to pledge money to build a bigger firewall to provide more than $400bn (\u00a3250bn) in fresh resources. George Osborne, who arrived in Washington on Thursday night for the spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank, has yet to say whether the UK will participate in the fundraising exercise, insisting that the eurozone must show a willingness to sort out its own problems first. With the US refusing to participate in the fundraising exercise, the IMF has already scaled down its target from the $600bn it was looking for when the eurozone crisis was at its height in late 2011. But the upward pressure on Italian and Spanish borrowing costs has raised the prospect that the eurozone's third and fourth-biggest economies might need financial support, providing extra ammunition for Lagarde as she asks for loans both from developed nations and the leading emerging economies. IMF sources said that they did not expect the US to respond to the call in an election year, since any loan made would have to be passed by both houses of Congress. Lagarde said she wanted the US to play its part in the international effort to combat future crises. \"The leading economic power in the world clearly has to have a leadership role,\" she said. Lagarde added that Europe needed to keep up the pace of reform and should aim for a \"deepening integration of the eurozone\". She expressed concern about five \"dark clouds\" \u2013 high unemployment, slow growth, over-rapid deleveraging by banks, strains in the eurozone and higher oil prices \u2013 gathering over the global economy. She said she was looking for further support from \"our broader membership\" to ensure that it could tackle crises and ensure global financial stability. \"The fund needs to participate in building additional firepower to the global firewall we have been advocating. I expect our own firepower to be significantly increased.\" So far, the eurozone has pledged $200bn to the IMF, Japan $60bn and Switzerland $26bn. Four other European countries \u2013 Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Poland \u2013 have between them agreed to contribute $35bn. With concern growing about the health of Spain's banks, Lagarde said she wanted the European authorities to be able to invest directly in financial institutions rather than through governments. Robert Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, said the impact of the European debt crisis was rippling out to poorer countries in the Balkans, south-east Europe and north Africa. \"The eurozone is going to be walking a very fine line,\" he said, adding that the European Central Bank (ECB) had only bought time by providing cheap three-year money to eurozone banks. \"That time has to be used. There needs to be a focus, not just on austerity and macro-economic stability, but on growth.\" Zoellick said the phase in which banks were able to use the low-cost funds from the ECB to purchase government bonds was coming to an end. \"Italy and Spain are vital,\" he added. \"We are not out of this mess yet. It is still a fragile economy.\" The World Bank president said that the outcome for the eurozone would depend on actions taken in individual countries and the structural reforms they implemented. \"It is very difficult to take these steps in a no-growth environment.\" Zoellick, who will be leaving the World Bank in the summer at the end of his five-year term, expressed concern that the new rules for banking regulation drawn up under the Basel III agreement were too tough and would choke off lending. \"Basel III is too strict in my view,\" he said.",

That leaves <strong>Vodafone</strong>, up 1.4p at 171.3p , as the only game in town unless Tata decides to re-enter the arena if a Vodafone bid is made. The mobile phone group has until 5pm on Thursday to make up its mind, and last night CWW said talks between the two companies were continuing.</p> <p>But investors have clearly decided to cash in, in case Vodafone also gets cold feet about a deal or comes up with a lowball offer, and CWW shares have dropped 7.63p to 29.42p. Analysts at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> It is possible CWW has had an indicative bid from Vodafone which gave the Board the confidence to turn Tata down, potentially preferring to recommend a higher offer to shareholders, although this has not been substantiated by either company yet. Certainly we expect CWW shareholders will be disappointed if both bidders walk away at this stage without an opportunity to evaluate potential bids themselves. <br> We note Tata would not be subject to a six-month lock-up to return to the process if Vodafone does make a formal offer now, although we think this is unlikely.  As Vodafone has had two \"put up or shut up\" extensions and over two months for due diligence already since it first announced it was \"in the very early stages of evaluating the potential merits of a potential offer for CWW\", we do not think shareholders would take kindly to another extension unless either: 1) an indicative bid price or range is made public; or 2) adequate information about the process is made public to reassure investors. </blockquote> <p>Overall, ahead of a much hyped Spanish debt auction and US weekly jobless figures, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has gained a little ground, up 31.45 points at 5776.74.</p> <p>A positive update from investment management group <strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong> saw its shares jump 21.5p to 503p.

      "bodyText": "Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide share's have plunged more than 20% as investors' hopes of a bidding war were dashed. After the market closed on Wednesday, potential bidder Tata Communications said it could not reach agreement with the CWW board and pulled out of the bidding. That leaves Vodafone, up 1.4p at 171.3p , as the only game in town unless Tata decides to re-enter the arena if a Vodafone bid is made. The mobile phone group has until 5pm on Thursday to make up its mind, and last night CWW said talks between the two companies were continuing. But investors have clearly decided to cash in, in case Vodafone also gets cold feet about a deal or comes up with a lowball offer, and CWW shares have dropped 7.63p to 29.42p. Analysts at Espirito Santo said: It is possible CWW has had an indicative bid from Vodafone which gave the Board the confidence to turn Tata down, potentially preferring to recommend a higher offer to shareholders, although this has not been substantiated by either company yet. Certainly we expect CWW shareholders will be disappointed if both bidders walk away at this stage without an opportunity to evaluate potential bids themselves. We note Tata would not be subject to a six-month lock-up to return to the process if Vodafone does make a formal offer now, although we think this is unlikely. As Vodafone has had two \"put up or shut up\" extensions and over two months for due diligence already since it first announced it was \"in the very early stages of evaluating the potential merits of a potential offer for CWW\", we do not think shareholders would take kindly to another extension unless either: 1) an indicative bid price or range is made public; or 2) adequate information about the process is made public to reassure investors. Overall, ahead of a much hyped Spanish debt auction and US weekly jobless figures, the FTSE 100 has gained a little ground, up 31.45 points at 5776.74. A positive update from investment management group Hargreaves Lansdown saw its shares jump 21.5p to 503p.
