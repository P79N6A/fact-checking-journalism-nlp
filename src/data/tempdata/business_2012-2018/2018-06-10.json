      "bodyText": "TSB has come under further pressure over the information it provided to parliament about its recent computer meltdown following the disclosure of a technical report into the IT crisis at the embattled bank. The leak comes after MPs on the Treasury committee were told by the Financial Conduct Authority, the City watchdog, that the TSB chief executive, Paul Pester, may have been aware that more wide-ranging problems had caused the computer collapse at the bank. IBM, the computing giant that was hired by TSB to help deal with the crisis after it erupted in April, had made preliminary conclusions that the problems were related to \u201ccustom and package applications, middleware services and the network,\u201d according to the Sunday Times. Indicating that TSB migrated customers on to a new IT platform without sufficient testing, the IBM report continued: \u201cIBM has not seen evidence of the application of a rigorous set of go-live criteria to prove production readiness.\u201d However, three days after TSB received the initial IBM report, Pester told parliament on 2 May that the bank\u2019s issues were restricted to the system\u2019s \u201cmiddleware\u201d \u2013 a term for the technology that sits between customer-facing computer applications and the bank\u2019s back-end databases. A TSB spokeswoman said: \u201cThe IBM document contained a preliminary work plan with very early hypotheses based on observations to date that were produced after only three days of engagement with TSB. To present this document as a clear view on what went wrong wouldn\u2019t be a fair reflection. Similarly, it isn\u2019t a fair reflection of what actions may or may not subsequently have been taken.\u201d The bank added that the IBM report had been shared with the FCA before it was received by the TSB board. \u201cThe FCA and PRA [Prudential Regulation Authority] were given direct access to IBM on the same evening that IBM spoke to the board,\u201d the spokeswoman added. \u201cThere can be no inference that TSB was hiding something. The fact is that the IBM document is not a report on the causes of the migration issues.\u201d The FCA also accused Pester of \u201cportraying an optimistic view\u201d of services after the botched operation in April to upgrade its computer systems continued to cause disruption for customers more than a month on. As many as 1.9m customers were locked out of their accounts. On Friday, the Treasury committee\u2019s chair, Nicky Morgan, said she had \u201clost confidence in [Pester\u2019s] ability to provide a full and frank assessment of the problems at TSB\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The government has been accused of mishandling its flagship industrial policy as Brexit dominates the agenda in Whitehall, with business leaders warning that the strategy is not receiving enough attention. The business lobby has joined Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs in condemning delays that mean ministers have yet to appoint a watchdog to oversee the industrial strategy or give details of the funds available to promote vital industries. Labour has tabled a series of parliamentary questions demanding an update from the business secretary, Greg Clark, from as early as Tuesday over the lack of progress seven months on from the launch of the industrial strategy. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, who lodged the questions last week, said: \u201cThe cabinet is in chaos over Brexit and their inability to focus on anything else is leaving businesses out to dry.\u201d Although Theresa May declared industrial strategy a priority when she became leader of the Conservative party two years ago, there are growing fears among business leaders that the policy is being allowed to wither on the vine. A white paper published last November was 18 months in the making and billed as the government\u2019s principal vehicle for boosting economic productivity \u2013 seen as one of the key reasons behind sluggish wage growth in the UK since the financial crisis. However, Brexit has overshadowed day-to-day life in Whitehall at the expense of the domestic policy agenda. Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cBecause of Brexit the industrial strategy is not getting enough attention. You could have the best possible deal in the world for Brexit but it won\u2019t make a difference if the conditions for growth aren\u2019t right at home.\u201d Labour has called on Clark to urgently explain why the watchdog \u2013 to be called the independent industrial strategy council and promised in last autumn\u2019s white paper \u2013 has not taken shape more than half a year later. Conceived of as a means of keeping tabs on the government\u2019s progress, a chair has yet to be named for the oversight body and there are no members of its board. A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), said it was important to ensure the watchdog had \u201cthe right expertise to monitor our progress in delivering our ambitious, modern industrial strategy\u201d. She added: \u201cWe are finalising the council\u2019s membership and scope. Details will be announced in due course.\u201d Lee Hopley, the chief economist at the EEF manufacturers\u2019 lobby group, said there had been a drop-off in activity since the launch of the white paper. \u201cWe need to measure progress; how do we know if this is working without the council?\u201d Sources told the Guardian of mounting tensions between the business department on one side and No 10 and the Treasury on the other over the level of funding available for the industrial strategy. However, there are increasing concerns businesses could be putting investment on hold as a consequence. Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats and former business secretary in the coalition government, said: \u201cThe lack of progress on the industrial strategy, coupled with the uncertainty caused by Brexit, is already holding back investment and will continue to do so to the tune of many billions of pounds.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce is set to announce more than 4,000 job losses this week as the aero-engine maker attempts to increase profits by cutting middle-management posts. The chief executive, Warren East, has decided to take action after stating repeatedly that the firm has become bloated with unnecessary layers of management and duplicated roles. The job cuts are expected to be unveiled on Friday when the firm is scheduled to update City analysts, some of whom have pencilled in a reduction of up to 10% of Rolls-Royce\u2019s 50,000 workforce. However, the job losses are unlikely to affect frontline engineering jobs after the company and unions agreed a deal last year to protect about 7,000 roles at plants in Derby \u2013 and Hucknall and Annesley in Nottinghamshire \u2013 as part of a \u00a3150m investment in UK aerospace facilities. Instead, areas such as finance, human resources and purchasing are expected to undergo job cuts. Rolls-Royce \u2013 which makes engines for Boeing and Airbus aircraft, as well as for the Eurofighter Typhoon and propulsion systems for Royal Navy nuclear submarines \u2013 declined to confirm the exact number of redundancies planned. A spokesman for the company said: \u201cWe are proposing to move to a considerably simplified staff structure, with fewer layers and greater spans of control across the group. \u201cWe said we had retained restructuring experts \u2026 to support us with this programme. We added that we expected this programme to deliver a significant reduction in costs and assist us in improving performance across the group as a whole.\u201d East, who was appointed as chief executive from the microchip designer ARM almost three years ago, inherited the controls of a great British engineering name but also one that had begun to lurch from crisis to crisis. He was forced to issue a profit warning on only his second day in the job, while historical allegations of corruption led to \u00a3671m in penalties and the company apologising in court last year, after Rolls-Royce was found to have paid millions of pounds\u2019 worth of bribes to secure orders in six countries, including Indonesia, Russia and China. East has pledged to increase Rolls-Royce\u2019s profitability and generate about \u00a31bn of free cashflow by 2020. Free cashflow is a measure of the cash available to a business after spending on core business infrastructure and it is thought vital to Rolls-Royce being able to develop new engines in the future. East has cut 5,500 jobs during his reign so far. In January, Rolls-Royce announced a reduction in operating businesses from five to three \u2013 civil aerospace, defence and power systems - and the company had already begun cutting staff while also indicating more drastic measures were to follow. Around the company\u2019s results in March, East said: \u201cIn the restructuring which followed from the transformation programme we announced in 2015, then approximately 600 senior managers left the organisation and we did, in fact, achieve some simplification. \u201cThe reality is, however, that there is more simplification that we need to do to make ourselves truly competitive and fit for the future. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re embarking on this further restructuring, seeking out duplications that exist. So, we\u2019ll have more to talk about as we get further into it.\u201d In a note to clients last month, analysts at the investment bank JP Morgan said: \u201cWe would not be surprised if [Rolls-Royce] announces a headcount reduction of c10%. We would not be surprised if its upfront restructuring costs were c\u00a3350-400m over [one to three] years.\u201d The research added that JP Morgan expected about \u00a3200m of recurring savings by 2021 because of the job cuts.",

      "bodyText": "Labour has insisted it is not toning down its nationalisation plans despite claims from a water company chief that a mutualisation-style approach has been discussed with opposition leaders. Labour has made forceful public statements on renationalising water \u2013 along with energy and rail \u2013 in recent months but a FTSE 250-listed utility claims the party is looking at alternative means of gaining control over the industry. Susan Davy, the chief financial officer of Pennon, which owns South West Water, said that although Labour was publicly talking about full nationalisation, she had noted a more emollient position during discussions with the party. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty consistent in the way they\u2019re talking about it in the media. But behind the scenes we\u2019re beginning to see a bit more differentiation in how they\u2019re talking about it,\u201d she said in an interview with financialdirector.co.uk. Davy added: \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting to us in the nuances of the Labour policy is that they are now drilling down much more. Their preference seems to be moving towards what we would call mutualisation, where you have some sort of model that allows customers to be owners. That\u2019s where we can have a much more informed conversation.\u201d A Labour spokesman declined to say what areas had been covered in discussions with water industry leaders but said: \u201cAs we announced in the general election, the next Labour government will take public ownership of water by issuing bonds in exchange for shares in the companies. We are not considering mutualisation.\u201d The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has pledged total, \u201cpermanent\u201d and cost-free renationalisation of the water, energy and rail industries if Labour wins power at the next election. In February he attacked the privatised water industry, accusing companies of paying out a \u201cscandalous\u201d sum of \u00a313.5bn in dividends to shareholders since 2010, while claiming huge tax breaks and forcing up water bills by 40% in real terms since privatisation of the industry in 1989. The heads of England\u2019s privatised water companies were criticised by the GMB trade union this month for banking \u00a358m in pay and benefits over the past five years while customers have received above-inflation rises in their water bills. Davy, who received a pay package of \u00a3922,000 last year, said the water industry was seeking to impress on Labour the fact that the large majority of shareholders in water companies are owned by the public. \u201cWhen you look at our model, and that of United Utilities and Severn Trent as well, 70% of our shareholders are pension funds, charities, employees \u2013 all in the UK,\u201d she said. Davy added that Pennon was aligned to Labour\u2019s position, regarding greater public say in how water is managed through its affiliation to the WaterShare initiative, in which an independent panel scrutinises Pennon\u2019s performance, and financial benefits from better-than-expected results are shared with customers. \u201cFrom our perspective, what we are already achieving is a long way to what they want,\u201d she said. The cost of nationalisation would be a significant hurdle, said Davy, referencing the thinktanks Social Market Foundation and the Centre for Policy Studies that recently quoted the cost of water nationalisation of \u00a390bn and \u00a386bn respectively. \u201cWe\u2019re building a body of evidence so they [Labour] can really understand where we\u2019re coming from, rather than us just saying we don\u2019t like the idea of nationalisation,\u201d Davy said.",

    "webTitle": "Deterring onshore windfarms means higher energy bills \u2013 Lord Deben", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ministers must come clean to households about the higher energy bills they face if the UK continues to deter new onshore windfarms, the government\u2019s top climate change adviser has said. Lord Deben, the chair of the committee on climate change (CCC), said there was no logical argument against onshore wind turbines in the parts of the UK that want them. The Conservative peer said the technology was the cheapest form of electricity generation and he hoped the government would rethink its opposition to subsidies to it. The government ended subsidies for the windfarms in 2015 but the energy minister Claire Perry has recently said she is \u201clooking carefully\u201d at a U-turn for windfarms built in Wales and Scotland. Last week, the government gave its backing to windfarms on remote islands, such as the Isle of Lewis. Deben told the Guardian: \u201cThere is no doubt, and I feel very strongly about it, that onshore wind is the cheapest form of electricity. If the Scots want to have it, on which basis should we say they shouldn\u2019t have it?\u201d Advocates believe onshore windfarms could be built for subsidies guaranteeing prices as low as \u00a350 per megawatt hour \u2013 below the average \u00a362.14 awarded to the latest offshore windfarms and far lower than the \u00a392.50 for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. The payments are a top-up on the wholesale electricity price of around \u00a345/MWh, with the difference paid by householders through their energy bills. Hinkley alone is expected to add \u00a310-15 to annual bills by 2030. \u201cIf you don\u2019t build onshore wind, the government has to say how much of an extra cost this is to the public,\u201d said Deben. The CCC advises the government on how to meet its legally binding climate targets. Deben, who as the Conservative MP John Gummer was the environment secretary from 1993 and 1997, added that the government has to make \u201cmajor changes\u201d to meet its carbon targets for 2025 and 2030, implying that a shift on onshore wind could be one of those. Big British, German and Spanish energy companies have been lobbying the government for a shift on onshore wind. Keith Anderson, the chief executive of ScottishPower, said it was \u201ccompletely bonkers\u201d that the windfarms were ineligible for subsidies, given they were low cost and low carbon. \u201c2018 has to be the year we secure the future of onshore wind,\u201d he told a recent industry event. Millions of households have seen their energy bills rise in the past few weeks. All of the big six suppliers have increased their prices, blaming government policy costs such as the clean energy subsidies, along with rising wholesale costs. Deben also issued a challenge to housebuilders to make new homes more efficient, saying they had to face up to the \u201csocial inequity\u201d of future generations facing unnecessarily high energy bills. \u201cEnergy efficiency is a social issue. No house should be built to condemn people in the future to having to pay a great deal for their energy,\u201d he said. He backed better enforcement of building regulations, saying local authorities did not have the resources to check new homes properly. The peer also called on mortgage lenders to begin tying the energy efficiency of properties to the amount buyers can borrow, an idea being given a trial in Wales. His comments were echoed this week by the CCC\u2019s chief executive, Chris Stark, who tweeted that it was \u201cdaft that we don\u2019t give greater priority to household energy efficiency\u201d. Deben still feels new nuclear power is needed as part of the UK\u2019s efforts to cut carbon emissions. However, he said new technology and the falling costs of renewables meant the challenge of ensuring energy security was not as great as in the past. \u201cThe government has got to recognise that keeping the lights on, which is its first worry, is much easier than thought because you can get a huge amount of energy from offshore wind, smart grids and short-term battery storage.\u201d A spokesperson at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: \u201cThe government does not believe that new large-scale onshore wind power is right for England but it could be right for other areas, where local public support exists.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May could hardly have been clearer. While campaigning to be prime minister in 2016, she attacked the levels of corporate pay and said there had to be changes to the way UK companies were run. \u201cIf I\u2019m prime minister,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have not just consumers represented on company boards but workers as well.\u201d May was not the first prime minister to think it would be a good idea for workers to have a say in how companies are run. As prime minister in the 1970s, James Callaghan commissioned a report on industrial democracy from the historian Alan Bullock. When the committee finally reported, a majority supported the idea that there should be equal numbers of trade union and shareholder representatives on the boards of private companies employing more than 2,000 people. Callaghan was such a strong supporter of the proposal that he arranged and attended a meeting of the Bullock committee with the then German chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, who was witheringly dismissive of the idea that workers on boards would lead to profits being diverted from investment to wages. On the contrary, Schmidt insisted, industrial democracy had been one of the pillars on which Germany\u2019s postwar economic miracle had been built. In the end, the Bullock report was kicked into the long grass. Despite support from Callaghan, the leader of the TUC, Len Murray, and Jack Jones, the head of the Transport and General Workers\u2019 Union and a member of the committee, it was strongly opposed by the CBI and by individual trade unions from across the political spectrum. The rest, as they say, is history. The failure to press ahead with the Bullock report\u2019s recommendations will \u2013 along with the failure to put Britain\u2019s North Sea oil receipts into a sovereign wealth fund \u2013 go down as one of the great missed opportunities of the past half-century. Some things have changed since 1977. After the many defeats suffered since Callaghan was followed into Downing Street by Margaret Thatcher, trade unions are all for greater industrial democracy. However, May\u2019s plan produced exactly the same response from employers as Callaghan encountered. Resistance from the CBI has meant May\u2019s proposals have been watered down. Plans for legislation to be presented to parliament on Monday will require companies to publish the ratio of what their chief executive is paid compared wih the average worker and how much executives will benefit if share prices go up but there will be no requirement to put workers on boards. May\u2019s original proposal was hardly revolutionary but the CBI lobbied hard and was able to kill it off with relative ease. Falling trade union membership and tougher laws mean that employers hold the whip hand over their employees. They intend to keep it that way. If UK bosses imagine that having workers on boards will cramp their style, the experience of France suggests they are wrong. Oxfam France has recently published a detailed analysis of the accounts of companies in the CAC 40 \u2013 the roll call of the biggest companies listed on the Paris stock exchange, including AXA, Michelin, Peugeot and Total. It found that Anglo-Saxon-style capitalism \u2013 fat cat chief executives, a focus on shareholder value, widespread use of tax havens \u2013 is alive and well on the other side of the Channel, even though French law insists on employee representation on boards for all large companies. The ratio of chief executive to median pay in France has been rising steadily and is the same as it is in Britain, at about 120 to 1. French companies in the CAC 40 are the highest dividend payers in western Europe; shareholders received two-thirds of profits in 2016 compared with 60% in the UK. In the US, the beating heart of Anglo-Saxon capitalism, shareholders had to make do with 48% of profits. From 2009 to 2016, the dividends paid to shareholders grew four times faster than employee salaries. Truly, this has been a good time to own shares in a CAC 40 company: in the first decade of the 21st century, French companies paid out 30% of their profits in dividends. \u201cAs a result, the distribution of wealth between the various stakeholders in CAC 40 companies has never been so uneven,\u201d the Oxfam France report says. \u201cWhile rewards for shareholders and CEOs have rocketed since the financial crisis, workers have seen their pay stagnate; investments in the long-term future of the companies have often been cut: and tax revenues which governments need to invest in vital public services have dwindled.\u201d This gets to the heart of the matter. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with executives being well rewarded for running successful businesses. Yet something is going seriously awry when rising executive pay sits alongside flatlining earnings for employees; and higher dividend payouts come at the expense of investment. At that point, the old justifications \u2013 risk-taking has to be remunerated and workers benefit from dividends through their pension funds \u2013 wear a bit thin. Employers have got everything they wanted: the right to manage, the emasculation of organised labour, much higher salaries and lower personal taxes. In return, they were supposed to bring about stronger growth, higher investment and rising living standards for all. They have not done so, which is why they are currently held in such low esteem. Schmidt was right all those years ago. Workers want to make sure they will have a job five years down the road and can see the point of investing in the companies\u2019 long-term future. Leaving everything in the hands of shareholders has led to short-termism and failure. The problem with May\u2019s proposals was not their radicalism: it was that they did not go far enough.",

      "bodyText": "They are ghosts from the retail past: Hugh Fraser, James Howell and John Rackham. Long-dead retail entrepreneurs who made their fortunes opening local department stores when they represented an exciting future. But last week the stores, still affectionately called Frasers, Rackhams and Howells by local shoppers who resisted attempts to rebrand them, were on a brutal closure list announced by stricken department store chain House of Fraser. The historic stores dotted around the country in places such as Darlington, Shrewsbury and Cardiff are relics of a golden age when every regional town and city could support its own department store. But in a cutthroat retail climate they are in the firing line, as struggling retailers balk at the investment required to modernise stores. \u201cDarlington had a big revamp a couple of years ago but if you go to Carlisle or Cirencester the stores are very higgledy-piggledy and need investment,\u201d says Graham Soult, who runs retail consultancy CannyInsights. \u201cSome stores have not been touched for a long time and are too far gone to put right now.\u201d The decision by the loss-making department store to pull the plug on half its sites, eliminating as many as 6,000 jobs, could be viewed as another instalment in this year\u2019s high-street crisis, which has seen Maplin and Toys R Us disappear from the high street and major chains including Marks &amp; Spencer, Carpetright and Mothercare announce store closures. But there is more to it at House of Fraser than high street crisis 2.0. Some landlords have been blindsided by the scale of the closure programme and the meagre terms being offered via the company voluntary arrangement, the insolvency process used to jettison stores. The extensive closure programme involves not only provincial outposts, but two stores in central London and large branches in Birmingham and Edinburgh. Landlords are in open rebellion over the plan, which they view as an unfair cherrypicking exercise by House of Fraser\u2019s wealthy Chinese owner, Sanpower, which is chaired by one of China\u2019s richest men, Yuan Yafei. Sanpower has set up a \u00a3140m side deal that will hand control to another Chinese group, C.banner, which owns Hamleys. Making good on the restructuring plan is a prerequisite of the deal that will inject \u00a370m of new funds into the business. House of Fraser\u2019s Cardiff branch, which dates back to 1856, is still known locally as Howells. Azeemeh Zaheer, chief executive of Naissance Capital Real Estate, which owns the premises, said the company only found out the night before the CVA was announced that it was on the list. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d said Zaheer, who claimed the firm had been amenable to a plan that would have cut the size of the shopfloor from 300,000 sq ft to 80,000 sq ft. \u201cWe had been discussing reducing the floor plate of the store and spending money on architects and surveys so we could create a viable shop for them to trade out of.\u201d Department store chains are struggling as the transfer of sales to the internet makes it harder to turn a profit from sprawling high street sites, many of which incurred hefty increases in business rates \u2013 the commercial equivalent of council taxes \u2013 as a result of last year\u2019s revaluation. At the same time, shoppers have reined in spending on clothing and household goods because of a squeeze on spare cash and a shift to renting rather than owning homes. Like many of House of Fraser\u2019s longstanding stores, the grade II-listed site in Cardiff is a hodgepodge of several buildings. House of Fraser was behind on millions of pounds\u2019 worth of repair work. Zaheer says Naissance Capital does not intend to back the CVA, which requires three-quarters of landlords voting to approve it. The property industry\u2019s resistance to having an estimated 3.3m sq ft of retail space \u2013 the equivalent of more than 50 football pitches \u2013 dumped back into its hands without compensation is understandable. Agents are still trying to find homes for about a third of BHS\u2019s 160 stores \u2013 two years after it crashed into administration \u2013 and rivals such as Debenhams are also planning closures. There are a limited number of contenders to fill empty stores, such as Sports Direct, Primark and Days, the new venture of retail entrepreneur Philip Day. But Alex Williamson, House of Fraser\u2019s chief executive, insists the retailer is fighting for its very survival: \u201cIt is a highly emotional, highly regrettable situation that none of us either imagined or wanted to see happen, but there is simply no alternative.\u201d Richard Hyman, an independent retail consultant, said creditors would probably agree to back the CVA, but that House of Fraser\u2019s problems ran much deeper. \u201cHouse of Fraser is telling us that it cannot any longer trade profitably in retail hotspots like central London, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Cardiff. If it cannot find enough of its target customers in these prime locations, where can they? This speaks volumes about its own management team\u2019s confidence in the brand.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>They are ghosts from the retail past: Hugh Fraser, James Howell and John Rackham. Long-dead retail entrepreneurs who made their fortunes opening local department stores when they represented an exciting future.</p> \n<p>But last week the stores, still affectionately called Frasers, Rackhams and Howells by local shoppers who resisted attempts to rebrand them, were on a brutal closure list <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/07/full-list-of-31-house-of-fraser-stores-under-threat-of-closure\" title=\"\">announced by stricken department store chain House of Fraser</a>.</p> \n<p>The historic stores dotted around the country in places such as Darlington, Shrewsbury and Cardiff are relics of a golden age when every regional town and city could support its own department store. But in a cutthroat retail climate they are in the firing line, as struggling retailers balk at the investment required to modernise stores.</p> \n<p>\u201cDarlington had a big revamp a couple of years ago but if you go to Carlisle or Cirencester the stores are very higgledy-piggledy and need investment,\u201d says Graham Soult, who runs retail consultancy CannyInsights. \u201cSome stores have not been touched for a long time and are too far gone to put right now.\u201d</p> \n<p>The decision by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/10/house-fraser-slides-44m-loss-ahead-chinese-takeover\" title=\"\">loss-making department store</a> to pull the plug on half its sites, eliminating as many as 6,000 jobs, could be viewed as another instalment in this year\u2019s high-street crisis, which has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/observer-view-collapse-toys-r-us-maplin-town-centres-retail-crisis\" title=\"\">Maplin and Toys R Us</a> disappear from the high street and major chains including Marks &amp; Spencer, Carpetright and Mothercare announce store closures.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3cec04db-2f8c-447b-a543-928aff466773\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Retailers that have gone bust 2017-18</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Toys R Us:</b> 180 stores employing 3,000 staff, collapsed 28 February.

The company intends to close 60 stores and change its fashion ranges, but faces a struggle to win back young shoppers.</p>\n    <p><b>House of Fraser</b>'s Chinese owner, Sanpower, had to stump up \u00a325m to see the store through Christmas and its debt is rated as junk. The retailer is attempting to reduce the size of its stores by 30% and has asked landlords to cut rents.</p>\n    <p><b>Debenhams</b>, a 178-store chain that is more than 200 years old, is axing one in four of its managers and considering closures to cut costs. It has warned that profits have been hit by lower than expected sales, with profit margins also down as a result of having to cut prices to match rivals.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But there is more to it at House of Fraser than high street crisis 2.0. Some landlords have been blindsided by the scale of the closure programme and the meagre terms being offered via the company voluntary arrangement, the insolvency process used to jettison stores. The extensive closure programme involves not only provincial outposts, but two stores in central London and large branches in Birmingham and Edinburgh.</p> \n<p>Landlords are in open rebellion over the plan, which they view as an unfair cherrypicking exercise by House of Fraser\u2019s wealthy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/13/house-of-fraser-sells-stake-chinese-sanpower\" title=\"\">Chinese owner, Sanpower</a>, which is chaired by one of China\u2019s richest men, Yuan Yafei.

Elton John and Paul Simon have unveiled such spectacles, and this week we get the City equivalent, as we all hum along to the familiar lyrics sung about the Square Mile\u2019s most notable septuagenarian showman. Yes, it\u2019s the WPP annual general meeting week, during which there is some kind of contractual obligation to have a row about founder Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s pay. As the rarely silent knight stepped down in April as chief executive from the advertising company he founded \u2013 amid allegations of personal misconduct \u2013 this will be the final time we get to hear the groans about how much he has just trousered (merely \u00a313.9m in 2017, compared with \u00a348.1m in 2016 and \u00a370.4m in 2015). All of which will be mildly entertaining, but this year\u2019s kicker is that shareholders are curious \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 about those allegations. The former boss has denied wrongdoing, while WPP claims that data privacy laws stop it from saying anything at all (for it, Sorrell really does seem to be the hardest word). Meanwhile, the City rumour mill is working overtime, with hugely varied theories about what the WPP founder is accused of (albeit with one common thread). Shareholders and their advisers are arguing that they need to hear the juice in order to assess if the company has got it right on future Sorrell payouts, with his existing long-term incentive scheme meaning he\u2019ll still be paid by WPP for another five years. As shareholder advisory service Glass Lewis puts it: \u201cAbsent [sic] further information, it\u2019s a bit unclear as to whether treating Sir Martin as a \u2018good leaver\u2019 is appropriate, and the board may face tough questions regarding their \u2018oversight\u2019 of the situation, along with succession planning.\u201d Which brings us to the second number to be performed this week. Who is going to be WPP\u2019s second chief executive? The company will argue it has done rigorous succession planning and that its swift appointment of a brace of joint chief operating officers \u2013 Mark Read, chief executive of WPP Digital, and Andrew Scott, chief operating officer for Europe \u2013 demonstrates as much. Read is thought to be the most likely internal candidate to take over, but an external search (with no public timetable) is now being conducted too. If that irritates shareholders a tad, then there will be other gripes too. Investors will also quiz the board on how they\u2019ve allowed Sorrell to leave without a non-compete clause \u2013 which has allowed him to immediately announce a new advertising venture, S4 Capital. WPP is keen to sound relaxed about this and its current non-execs have alibis, with all of them arriving at the firm after Sorrell\u2019s last contract was signed in 2008. It will also argue that Sorrell can\u2019t use his knowledge of WPP\u2019s contracts to nick clients, and can\u2019t poach staff as they do have non-compete clauses. Still, the suspicion is that there is an additional reason why WPP is not sweating about S4: theories are swirling around the City that Sorrell\u2019s backers will prove to be too nervous to commit funds, just in case the allegations become public and prove scandalous.
