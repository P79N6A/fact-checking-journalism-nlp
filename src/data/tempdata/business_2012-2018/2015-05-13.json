    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Eurozone growth leapt ahead of the UK and US during the first three months of the year after cheap oil, a weak currency and a huge injection of funds by the European Central Bank pushed economic growth to 0.4%. With only four countries slipping backwards, the 19-member eurozone\u2019s recovery outstripped the 0.3% growth rate recorded by the UK and 0.2% by the US in the same period. The rise in GDP was supported by tailwinds from falling fuel prices, which put extra cash into consumers\u2019 pockets, and the export-boosting drop in the value of the euro. Another boost came from the ECB\u2019s long-awaited \u20ac1.1tr (\u00a3790bn) monetary stimulus to bring down the cost of credit, while budgetary policies across the eurozone are not as stringent as they were just a year ago. But is was unclear whether the improving growth rate could be sustained while several of the currency bloc\u2019s major nations wrestle with high unemployment and even higher debts. Peter Vanden Houte, an economist at ING bank, said: \u201cGrowth is clearly broadening across the eurozone. That said, the jury is still out on whether growth has reached enough escape velocity to see a self-sustained recovery, as the first confidence indicators for the second quarter levelled off a bit, now that oil prices have increased and the euro exchange rate strengthened.\u201d This is how some of the eurozone economies fared in first-quarter growth this year: France: 0.6% Beating all expectations, France expanded at the fastest rate for two years leading finance minister Michel Sapin to say it would now beat its 2015 growth target. French exports slowed, however, and a depressed real estate market remained a drag on economic activity, the statistics office, INSEE, showed. Separate figures also revealed weaker than expected employment data, signalling a rise in unemployment beyond 10.4%. IHS Global Insight economist Diego Iscaro said: \u201cThe sharp acceleration in activity during the first quarter ... points to growth in 2015 being somewhat stronger than expected by the government. However, we still do not estimate that the recovery will be strong enough to make a significant dent into France\u2019s high unemployment rate.\u201d Economists at Natixis said exports had started to contribute positively to growth in the second quarter. Italy: 0.3% The eurozone\u2019s third biggest economy grew 0.3% quarter on quarter, slightly more than expected thanks to a pickup in domestic demand. The figures fuelled hopes of a recovery this year after three years of recession. Rome has benefited from being granted more deficit leeway by the EU Commission, which has supported its economic reforms. But Brussels emphasised that the year-old left of centre government of Matteo Renzi should move quickly to privatise state assets, use windfall gains to cut debt and implement an enabling law for tax reform by September 2015. Germany: 0.3% German growth more than halved to 0.3% from 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net trade was a drag on Europe\u2019s largest economy, with imports growing at a faster rate than exports due in large part to the slowdown in China. To speed up growth, Berlin was urged by the EU commission on Wednesday to spend some of its budget surplus and adopt expansionary policies. Finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has already confirmed the government will spend an extra \u20ac10bn on infrastructure, but critics of German austerity believe it could spend more revamping an ageing rail network and crumbling autobahns. Spain: 0.9% Spain, which published growth figures last week, recorded its fastest rate of expansion in seven years in the first quarter. It grew by 0.9% and is set to grow at almost twice the speed of the euro area this year. In Brussels, Madrid is considered the euro poster child, after it imposed strict austerity budgets, liberalised the labour market and tackled the legacy of bad debt held by banks since being hit by the crisis. But unemployment has remained among the highest in the EU at 23% and many of the jobs created in recent years have been in the public sector and construction industry \u2013 repeating a pattern seen before the financial crisis. Greece: -0.2% The Greek economy shrank in the first three months of the year, plunging the troubled country back into recession following a 0.4% fall in GDP in the previous quarter. Analysts said it was clear that more than four months of wrangling over the terms of an extension to the country\u2019s massive bailout programme has taken its toll.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has cut its forecasts for GDP and wage growth, but insisted Britain\u2019s economic recovery remained \u201csolid\u201d. In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) predicted growth of 2.5% in 2015, down from the 2.9% it was expecting in February, after GDP was weaker than expected in the first quarter. The MPC also cut its forecast for next year from 2.9% to 2.6%, and for 2017 from 2.7% to 2.4%. The Bank\u2019s more cautious approach came as new data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the unemployment rate fell to 5.5% in the three months to March, down from 5.6% the previous month. The drop of 35,000 in the number of unemployed people took the total to 1.82 million, a seven-year low. Employment also improved, with the number of people in work rising by 202,000 in the three months to March to more than 31 million, the highest since records began, in 1971. The UK now has an employment rate of 73.5%, which is also a record, although for men the figure is even higher at 78.4%. Some 70,000 of the extra workers were drawn from those aged over 65. Wage growth, excluding bonuses, hit 2.2%. Since inflation dropped to about zero at the beginning of this year, real wages have soared. The inflation report said: \u201cDespite the weakness in the first quarter, the outlook for growth remains solid. Household real incomes have been boosted by the fall in food, energy and imported goods prices. The absorption of remaining slack and a pickup in productivity are expected to support wage growth in the period ahead.\u201d As wages rise and the impact of falling oil prices wanes, the MPC expects inflation to bounce back to its 2% target at the end of its two-year forecasting horizon, allowing it to raise interest rates at the gradual pace currently priced in by the City. That suggests Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, could leave Britain at the end of his five-year term with interest rates at just 1.5% \u2013 well below the levels once considered the norm. When borrowing costs were slashed to the unprecedented level of 0.5% in the depths of the financial crisis in March 2009, analysts saw it as a short-term emergency measure. But the latest forecasts from the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, published the report on Wednesday, backed the City\u2019s expectations that interest rates will start rising only in 2016. Investors are pricing in rates of just 1.4% by the second quarter of 2018 \u2013 though in reality the MPC tends to move in quarter-point steps. The governor\u2019s term ends in July of that year. Howard Archer, UK economist at consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cThe inflation report suggests that interest rates will rise extremely gradually at least through to mid-2018. This is likely to be reinforced now that the Conservatives are set to press ahead with major spending cuts in the next two to three years.\u201d However, the MPC is known to be deeply divided about the likely path for inflation, with hawkish members, including Martin Weale, stressing the risks of inflation. By contrast, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, warned in March that the next move in rates might need to be a cut, to stave off deflation. The Bank has repeatedly had to reduce its forecasts for wage growth. This is because pay has failed to recover as rapidly as the improvement in the labour market would suggest, creating a prolonged squeeze on living standards. The MPC had expected pay growth of 3.5% for 2015, but the inflation report forecasts cut that to 2.5%. Inflation measured on the consumer prices index fell to zero in March, reflecting plunging oil prices, forcing the governor to write a second explanatory letter to the chancellor, George Osborne, about why it has fallen so far below the Bank\u2019s 2% target. In the letter, published alongside the inflation report, Carney said the MPC still expected \u201ca negative out-turn\u201d \u2013 falling prices \u2013 at some point this year; but \u201cinflation should pick up notably once earlier declines in commodity prices start to drop out of the annual comparison towards the end of this year\u201d. In his reply to Carney\u2019s letter, Osborne took the opportunity to stress that he believed the Conservative government had been returned to power with a mandate to press ahead with its deficit-cutting programme. He said: \u201cUltimately, the credibility of our economic policy rests on the strength of our public finances. This new government now has a clear mandate to take the steps needed to return them to surplus and ensure continued economic security.\u201d Carney said the drag on the economy from fiscal policy was one factor that would delay rate rises over the coming months.",

Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Word is coming through that taxes are at the focus of the meeting called by finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. The talks, which are also being attended by Panaghiotis Nikoloudis, the minister in charge of combatting corruption, are aimed at finalising strategy before the cabinet meeting is held. Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led administration has signalled that a barrage of new levies will be among the fiscal measures it will announce in its bid to unlock \u20ac7.2bn in international bailout funds held over by the EU and IMF. Privatisations - not least the sale of Piraeus port still in the hands of the state - are also topping the agenda as the government attempts to quash mounting criticism of its policies from within its own ranks. More fuel for the rising oil price. After Tuesday\u2019s news from the American Petroleum Institute that US stockpiles fell for the second week in a row, the US Energy Information Administration has also recorded a fall in stocks. Crude inventories dropped by 2.2m barrels in the last week, compared with analysts forecasts of an increase of 386,000. The growth in the eurozone is down to Mario Draghi\u2019s QE bounce, reckons economics correspondent Phillip Inman (see also below). Phillip writes: There\u2019s a return to healthy growth in the eurozone. Surprised? It\u2019s called the QE bounce. First the head of the central bank says he will inject \u00a31.1tn into the 19-member economic bloc under a programme of quantitative easing (QE). Next, bank lending gets easier. More importantly, businesses breathe a sigh of relief, realising that after four years of austerity someone has put some serious money behind the eurozone\u2019s recovery. Live Greece back in recession; Bank of England cuts growth forecast - live updatesThe latest eurozone GDP data show France and Italy beat forecasts, but the Greek recovery has been snuffed outRead more Without downplaying the effect of low oil prices on consumer spending, it is the invisible hand of European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi \u2013 working the credit levers to make lending cheaper \u2013 that has done the trick. Full analysis here: Some better news for Greece with the country recording an unexpected budget surplus for the first four months of the year. Reuters reports: Greece\u2019s central government recorded a primary budget surplus of \u20ac2.16bn in the first four months of the year, versus a targeted small budget deficit due to a slash in spending, the finance ministry said on Wednesday. The central government surplus excludes the budgets of social security organisations and local administrations and is different from the figure monitored by Greece\u2019s EU/IMF lenders, but indicates the state of the cash-strapped country\u2019s finances. The government had targeted a primary budget deficit of \u20ac287m for the four-month period, data from the ministry showed. Tax revenues came in at \u20ac14.29bn, broadly in line with a target of \u20ac14.28bn. Public spending stood at \u20ac16.32bn, \u20ac2bn below target as the cash-strapped country cuts back on expenditure to meet its obligations. Wall Street has opened higher after the latest data seemed to push any US interest rate further into the distance, almost certainly beyond the June Federal Reserve meeting at least. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 44 points or 0.25%, while most European markets apart from Germany are also in positive territory. Meanwhile oil continues to rise after Tuesday\u2019s news from the American Petroleum Institute that US stockpiles fell for the second week in a row, with Brent crude up 0.7% at $67.33, near a five month high. Consumers have failed to spash out as much as expected in April, as hopes of a bounceback after the first quarter\u2019s poor weather were dashed, and the chances of an interest rate rise receded further. According to the Commerce Department, April retail sales were unchanged at 1.1% (with the March figure revised upwards from 0.9%). Analysts had expected a 0.2% increase, but sales of big ticket items like cars were disappointing. Wall Street futures have slipped slightly on the news, and James Knightley of ING Bank said: US retail sales for April are softer than hoped, coming in flat on the month versus a 0.2% month on month consensus. Admittedly, the March figure was revised higher by two tenths of a percentage point, but the overall story is one of subdued spending by consumers. Indeed, strip out the volatile components of autos, gasoline and building materials to come up with the so called \u201ccontrol\u201d group \u2013 this has a better fit with overall consumer spending trends \u2013 and we saw flat growth versus a consensus forecast of 0.5% growth. Consequently, we still aren\u2019t really seeing the big recovery that was anticipated in the wake of the weather depressed first quarter. This just really reinforces the view that a June hike isn\u2019t happening and that September looks the more probable start point. And here\u2019s a full breakdown of European growth in the last quarter: A quick recap of the main points, for anyone just tuning in.... Europe\u2019s recovery continues. The eurozone posted growth of 0.4% in the first three months of this year, faster than the UK or America. It\u2019s the fastest expansion in four years: France began the morning as the surprise star performer, growing by 0.6% thanks to strong domestic consumption. The French finance minister said the news was \u2018comforting\u2019. There was also relief for Italy, which posted 0.3% growth. Germany, though, slowed sharply from 0.7% to 0.3%, while Portugal and the Netherlands both grew by 0.4%. And there was gloom for Greece, which contracted by 0.2% -- putting the Greek economy back into recession, along with Finland, which shrank by 0.1%. Analysts say that the ECB\u2019s QE programme is working. Greece remains gripped by its escalating debt crisis, prompting finance minister Yanis Varoufakis to rule out a parallel currency. Government insiders also say that a referendum is now unlikely; Greece simply doesn\u2019t have time to hold one before running out of cash. Alexis Tsipras has called a cabinet meeting to discuss the situation; he\u2019s reportedly planning to address the nation afterwards. In the UK, the Bank of England has cut its growth forecasts, but insisted the country isn\u2019t flirting with deflation. Governor Mark Carney also hailed the \u2018heroic work\u2019 that European policymakers are doing to fix the Greek crisis, and predicted Britain wouldn\u2019t be badly hurt if they failed. The EC is also raising the pressure on Finland to bring its deficit into line. Germany, though, isn\u2019t facing new penalties for running a huge trade surplus: In 2014, Germany\u2019s trade surplus was almost 7% of the country\u2019s GDP. Ben Bernanke, the former head of the Federal Reserve, is one of many experts who is worried: As Bernanke blogged last month: In a slow-growing world that is short aggregate demand, Germany\u2019s trade surplus is a problem. Several other members of the euro zone are in deep recession, with high unemployment and with no \u201cfiscal space\u201d (meaning that their fiscal situations don\u2019t allow them to raise spending or cut taxes as a way of stimulating domestic demand). Despite signs of recovery in the United States, growth is also generally slow outside the euro zone. The fact that Germany is selling so much more than it is buying redirects demand from its neighbors (as well as from other countries around the world), reducing output and employment outside Germany at a time at which monetary policy in many countries is reaching its limits. Persistent imbalances within the euro zone are also unhealthy, as they lead to financial imbalances as well as to unbalanced growth The European Commission has recommended that Britain gets its deficit down, builds more houses, and tackles the skills gap. That\u2019s the conclusion from its latest report into the UK economy, just released: It HEREBY RECOMMENDS that the United Kingdom take action in 2015 and 2016 to: Ensure effective action under the excessive deficit procedure and endeavour to correct the excessive deficit in a durable manner by 2016-17, in particular by prioritising capital expenditure. Take further steps to boost supply in the housing sector, including by implementing the reforms of the national planning policy framework. Address skills mismatches by increasing employers\u2019 engagement in the delivery of apprenticeships. Take action to further reduce the number of young people with low basic skills. Further improve the availability of affordable, high-quality, full-time childcare. You can see all the latest recommendations online, here. Over in Athens the finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has ruled out any suggestion that the crisis-hit country is planning to adopt a parallel currency. Helena Smith reports: Doorstepped as he went to work, the minister insisted that \u201cfor the government there is \u2026 only a political solution\u201d to the huge liquidity problem that protracted negotiations have caused. \u201cIn negotiations there are mutual concessions,\u201d he told reporters gathered outside the finance ministry. Varoufakis was speaking as it emerged that an estimated \u20ac7bn euro had been withdrawn from Greek banks in April alone (when outflows were believed to have dropped considerably). Some \u20ac35bn euro has been removed from the banking system since December, according to finance ministry officials. Government sources have confirmed that prime minister Alexis Tsipras will address the nation after his ministers meet in cabinet session later today. The far left leader is expected to tell Greeks about the state of negotiations. Despite the wide speculation that the talks have engendered, very little has been revealed about the decisions/concessions that have been made. There were reports this morning that differences between Athens and foreign lenders were still huge, with the EU and IMF pushing the anti-austerity government to take additional fiscal measures worth at least \u20ac3bn euros. And as we flagged up earlier, the government appears to have ruled out a referendum, due to lack of time.... Greece\u2019s finance minister appears to have hinted that the government might not last the year. Mario Draghi should get a lot of credit for the revival in the eurozone economy. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing scheme, launched in January, is working. \u201cDraghi has thrown the kitchen sink at Europe, and it seems to be beginning to work. The European economy is showing signs of economic improvement and likely there will be more to come. Already PMI and credit growth are showing decisive improvements. The combination of a lower Euro boosting exports, ultra-low borrowing rates, and enhanced liquidity as a result of QEare all helping the economy. \u201cYes, Greece remains a fly in the ointment, but we don\u2019t see this as the systemic risk it was in 2012. Overall, the Eurozone is reacting to QE just as the US and the UK did, and investors should feel confident that growth will build momentum during the second quarter.\u201d Economists have hailed the news that the eurozone (and indeed the wider EU) grew by 0.4% in the first three months of this year, beating the UK and America. Josie Cox of the Wall Street Journal has rounded up the best reaction. Here\u2019s a flavour: Luigi Speranza, economist at BNP Paribas \u201cOverall, while slightly below our forecasts, the eurozone GDP figure for Q1 was encouraging. \u201cWith plenty of scope for exports and investment to accelerate from current levels, we continue to expect growth of around 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in Q2, despite some possible slowdown in consumption, as oil prices have come back up from their lows.\u201d Azad Zangana, European economist at Schroders \u201cOverall I think this is a very strong set of numbers, even though some of the individual country reports were still mixed. \u201cI think that it will certainly support the case for stocks and help corporate earnings. As this happens, the quite lofty valuations that we\u2019re seeing in equities will start to look more justified.\u201d More here: Eurozone GDP: Reactions From the Market Are European policymakers right to be so complacent about the dangers and consequences if Greece were to leave the eurozone? European policymakers are making heroic efforts to avoid that situation. They and the IMF are working relentlessly.. .there is no complacency, replies governor Carney. That said.... our assessment is that an intensification of the Greek crisis would have an impact on global growth, and only a modest impact on UK growth. And things are quite different than two or thee years ago, in terms of the linkages within the financial system, the improvement in the underlying eurozone economy, and the recent enhancement of the ECB\u2019s toolkit and its willingness to use it. Ludovic Subran, chief economist at Euler Hermes, reckons the Bank of England\u2019s forecasts are still too optimistic: Paul Mason of Channel 4 accuses the Bank of England of dangerous inertia Inflation falls to zero, you do nothing, people feel a short-term rise in real wages. the government wins re-election, you still do nothing, he says. You are two percentage points out of your inflation target, and it feels like 2007 when we sat here with Mervyn King saying all is fine. Something\u2019s going to happen.... Carney replies: What\u2019s going to happen is that the rise in the oil price will feed through to the inflation rate. And there are signs that wages are picking up. Right now, the Bank doesn\u2019t believe there is a need for more stimulus measures. Is the Bank of England worried that the pound is at a seven year high, following a swathe of interest rate cuts by other central banks? Is there a currency war underway, asks Phil Aldrick of The Times. Carney replies that sterling\u2019s strength is a factor in the path of interest rates -- in other words, a strong pound means borrowing costs may stay low for longer. And that\u2019s sent the pound dipping a little... Paul Mason has the microphone..... What are the three big challenges facing the UK economy? Mark Carney says the challenge facing the Bank is to get inflation back to target, and keep it there. But he also cites the need to improve Britain\u2019s \u201cpoor\u201d productivity growth, as it\u2019s the long term driver of living standards. We must also insure that the UK\u2019s financial system has integrity, and is open and innovative. Some of the measures introduced since the financial crisis may need to be adjusted, to ensure they are working, Carney concludes. What does the Governor make of the recent price falls in the sovereign bond market? Carney explains that the Bank had been surprised that the longer-term yield curve has flattened (ie, that governments could borrow so cheaply for a long time). It\u2019s not entirely surprising that they\u2019re moving back up now. Is it technically driven, or fundamentally driven, though? Carney declines the chance to comment too closely on the recent moves. And why has the Bank of England downgraded its forecast for productivity growth? It\u2019s the nature of the jobs being created, and the nature of the people doing those jobs, Carney replies. You get people who are new to jobs, who aren\u2019t as productive as they will be eventually be. What work has the Bank of England done into the impact of the government\u2019s plan for an EU referendum, asks the BBC\u2019s Robert Peston? Carney says the Bank has looked at this issue, though its regular surveys of UK companies. There was an awareness of uncertainty, but firms\u2019 business plans hadn\u2019t been affected by it, yet. And we will keep watching closely, as it could be an \u201cimportant determinant\u201d of whether the economy performs as expected. Back in Greece, there are reports that prime minister Alexis Tsipras could issue a \u2018proclamation\u2019, following today\u2019s cabinet meeting (see 9.51am) Larry Elliott, our economics editor, reminds Mark Carney that growth slowed sharply after the 2010 election. Why should it be different this time? Carney explains that it depends on the path of fiscal consolidation, which depends on the decisions of the government. We\u2019ll adjust our forecast if the government announces new measures, he syas. But the Conservative Party manifesto included \u00a325bn of cuts, and David Cameron has pledged to implement the manifesto in full. Why hasn\u2019t the Bank of England taken that into account? Carney: There were also spending plans, though. We\u2019re not going to speculate, we\u2019re going to wait for the next budget. Onto questions.... Was the Bank of England surprised by the election result, and has it changed its economic forecasts since the Conservative Party won a majority? We forecast many things, but not political outcomes, Mark Carney smiles. The Bank adjusts policy to events, both here and abroad. Today\u2019s forecasts do take March\u2019s budget into account. Carney also touches on the eurozone, and suggests that Britain is pretty-well protected from Greece\u2019s woes. Any intensification in the Greek crisis would probably only have a modest impact on UK growth, he says. Mark Carney is also warning that UK productivity remains weak - one factor, he suggests, is that there has been a \u201cdisproportionate\u201d increase in low productivity jobs since the recovery. Mark Carney, BoE governor, has written a second letter to the chancellor explaining why inflation is below target (it\u2019s currently zero). But he insists that there are no signs that Britain is heading into a protracted period of falling prices, or deflation. The Bank of England\u2019s quarterly inflation report press conference is underway, and being streamed live here. Inflation Report 13 May 2015 Back in the UK, the Bank of England is publishing its quarterly inflation report. And the top line is that the British central bank has cut its growth forecasts for this year, and beyond. The Bank of England now growth this year to come in at 2.5%, down from 2.9% three months ago. [that was before we learned that growth slowed to 0.3% in the first quarter] It also cut its projections for 2016 and 2017 to 2.6% and 2.4% respectively. \u201cGrowth is forecast to be at or a little below its historical average rate throughout the forecast period\u201d Eurostat also reports that Cyprus\u2019s economy grew by 1.6% in the last quarter, as it fights back from its bailout crisis of 2013. That means just two countries are in recession - Finland and Greece. This chart confirms that the nascent Greek recovery has been snuffed out: Greece has fallen back into recession! The Greek economy shrank by 0.2% in the first three months of this year, following a 0.4% contraction in the last three months of 2014. Greece had returned to growth last year, offering hopes that the worst of its crisis was behind it. Instead, the political uncertainty that has gripped the country for months has hit demand. Here we go! The Eurozone economy grew by 0.4% in the first three months of 2015. That\u2019s thanks to France\u2019s unexpectedly strong growth, up 0.6%, and another solid month in Germany, up 0.3%. That\u2019s broadly in line with forecasts, and means the eurozone expanded faster than both Britain and the United States. Over in Athens prime minister Alexis Tsipras has called another cabinet meeting for this afternoon. This follows a marathon five-hour session on Tuesday, where cabinet ministers representing his anti-austerity government hotly debated concessions and \u201cred lines\u201d. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Ministers emerging from yesterday\u2019s meeting were in two minds over the prospect of a referendum being held to approve any deal that is ultimately agreed. A public vote would require at least 30 days to set up from the day of announcement, constitutional lawyers say. With public coffers practically empty - and public sector pension and salary payments looming - there is a growing realisation that there may simply not be enough time. German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble\u2019s almost mocking acceptance of the idea has also given the government cause for concern, insiders say. The interior minister Nikos Voutsis gave voice to the government\u2019s new thinking telling parliament this morning: \u201cWe will have neither a referendum nor elections [but] an honourable compromise.\u201d A compromise, it is fast emerging, would include Athens rolling back on pledges to increase the minimum wage to \u20ac751 and reintroduce a 13th Christmas bonus for pensioners. Back in the eurozone...and Portugal has reported growth of 0.4% in the first three months of 2015. That\u2019s a little weaker than expected, but matches the growth in the last three months of 2014. The pound has hit a five-month high against the US dollar, up half a cent to $1.5727. Traders are welcoming this latest drop in UK unemployment, and calculating that it may herald an interest rate rise. Reminder, the Bank of England issues its new quarterly inflation report in an hour.... Breaking news: the UK\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to 5.5%, its lowest level since the summer of 2008. The number of people out of work fell by 35,000 to 1.83 million, according to data just released by the Office for National Statistics. And encouragingly, average earnings rose by 1.9% in the three months to March, up from 1.7%. At first glance, it\u2019s a good set of figures. So, the big news is that the eurozone\u2019s five largest members all posted growth in the first three months of this year. A reminder of the key points so far: Germany: grew by +0.3% in the first three months of 2014. Slowdown. Worse than expected. France: grew by +0.6%. Acceleration. Better than expected. Italy: +0.3%. Acceleration. Better than expected. The Netherlands: +0.4%. Slowdown. Worse than expected. We already know that Spain\u2019s economy grew by 0.9% in first quarter of 2015 (Madrid released its data last month). So, there\u2019s a good chance that the eurozone grew by as much as 0.5%. Just 40 minutes to wait.... It\u2019s a morning of surprises... at 0.3%, Italy grew as fast as Britain and Germany last quarter. Don\u2019t fancy our chances.... Get the bunting out! Italy\u2019s economy expanded by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2015, faster than expected. However, that still means growth was flat over the last 12 months. More to follow.... Corrrection. It appears that Austria is not reporting GDP data today, as I thought. Its statistics office did issue a preliminary estimate of 0.1% growth late last month. Slovakia\u2019s economy grew by 0.8% in the last quarter, beating forecasts of 0.6%. European stock markets are rallying this morning, led by France. The French CAC has jumped by 0.9%, as traders welcome the news that its GDP rose by 0.6% last quarter. The FTSE 100 is up 0.5%, and Germany\u2019s DAX has gained 0.6%. And the bond markets are calmer too, after yesterday\u2019s wild selloff. It\u2019s not a great day for Finland -- not only is its economy shrinking, but it\u2019s about to get ticked off by Brussels for borrowing too much. The Netherlands economy experienced a slowdown in the last quarter. Dutch GDP rose by 0.4%, down from 0.8% in the last three months of 2014 (which I think has been revised up from 0.5%) Bad news for Finland. Its economy shrank by 0.1% in the first three months of the year, its statistics office has estimated. And that follows a 0.3% contraction in the last three months of 2014, meaning it is in recession. As this chart shows, Finland has been struggling since the end of 2012 Finland is suffering from a cocktail of problems. Growth has been hit by austerity measures imposed to bring its deficit down to European targets. It has been struggling to cope with the decline of Nokia, and tougher times in the forestry industry. Finland has also felt the impact of the sanctions imposed on Russia, its neighbour, over the Ukraine crisis. No wonder its its new coalition government looked so serious yesterday: Romania has beaten forecasts with quarterly growth of 1.6%. More data is coming in. Hungary\u2019s economy grew by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the first three month of 2015, or 3.4% compared to a year ago. Its statistics office said there was robust growth in manufacturing (mainly vehicles and electronics) and food production. Analysts at BNP Paribas reckon the French GDP paints a unduly positive picture, because it is driven by household spending rather than business investment. It\u2019s worth remembering that the oil price has risen since the start of this year, so that stimulus effect may now fade away. (Brent crude costs $67 per barrel today, compared with $47 in mid-Jabuary. In the comments section, johnsnow92 has kindly explained why net trade had a negative impact on Germany\u2019s growth rate: France\u2019s finance minister, Michel Sapin, says today\u2019s forecast-beating growth 0f 0.6% is \u201cclearly comforting\u201d, and bodes well for the rest of the year. Sapin told reporters: \u201cThis first figure is very encouraging,....Our growth perspectives for 2015 are today clearly comforting.\u201d Thomas Gitzel, chief economist at VP Bank, blames weaker global demand for Germany\u2019s slowdown: \u201cWeak global trade is hitting German industry - an export heavyweight - and if the consumers start refraining from spending too, overall economic growth will decline rapidly.\u201d \u201cBut there\u2019s no reason to be miserable - the euro is weak and interest rates are low, both of which point to somewhat solid growth in the coming quarters.\u201d (quotes via Reuters) Germany\u2019s economy is rather like its top football team, says ING economist Carsten Brzeski, good, but not quite good enough. He writes: As witnessed in yesterday\u2019s soccer Champions League semi-final: a solid performance is not (always) sufficient to stay at the top. As Bayern Munich will probably now discuss new investments in its current squad, the German government should do the same for its economy. And that should include more efforts to stimulate the jobs market: The labour market seems to have reached a level of full employment. New structural reforms would be needed to push unemployment below the level it has now been fluctuating around for two years. As regards investment, except for the construction sector, industrial production has moved rather horizontally for almost four years. IHS Global Insight economist Diego Iscaro predicts that the French economy will grow faster than expected this year, but its jobless rate will remain too high: The sharp acceleration in activity during the first quarter ...points to growth in 2015 being somewhat stronger than the 1.0% expected by the government,\u201d \u201cHowever, we still do not estimate that the recovery will be strong enough to make a significant dent into France\u2019s high unemployment rate\u201d. Who predicted this last year? France\u2019s economy has grown twice as fast as Germany between January and March, and also twice as fast as the UK. And here\u2019s a Destatis chart, confirming that Germany\u2019s growth rate has slowed: Germany\u2019s growth rate slowed because imports grew faster than exports. Destatis, the stats body, explains: According to provisional calculations, exports of goods and services were slightly up at the beginning of 2015 compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, imports recorded a much stronger increase. However, household consumption rise, and business investment jumped markedly. Just in: Germany\u2019s economy grew by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2015, weaker than expected. That\u2019s a big drop on the 0.7% growth achieved in the last three months of 2014. Economists had expected growth of 0.5%. More to follow.... This charts shows how household spending (consumption) drove French growth in the last quarter, while business investment (GFCF) dipped. The big drop in net trade is because imports outpaced exports. The full report is here. France needs to keep growing at this rate to bring its jobless rate down from record levels, says Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi. Although France\u2019s recovery is impressive, it was driven by consumer spending rather than business investment. That\u2019s not a great sign. INSEE, the statistics office, explains: In the three first months of 2015, household consumption expenditure accelerated (+0.8% after +0.1%) while total gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) decreased again (\u20130.2% after \u20130.4%). Overall, total domestic demand (excluding inventory changes) increased: it contributed for +0.5 points to GDP growth (after +0.1 points in Q4 2014). And trade had a negative impact on GDP: exports growth slowed to +0.9% (from +2.5%) while imports accelerated (+2.3% after 1.5%). Here we go..... and France has smashed expectations. The French economy grew by 0.6% in the first three months of this year, having stagnated in the previous quarter. That\u2019s the best growth figures in at least two years, and much stronger than expected. FRENCH PRELIMINARY Q1 GDP +0.6 PCT Q/Q (F\u2019CAST + 0.4 PCT) VS REVISED 0.0 PCT IN Q4 2014 - INSEE Details to follow.... Today\u2019s GDP data may show growth in France and Italy picked up, predicts Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: France, in particular is set to see a significant rebound in economic activity, from 0.1% to 0.4% for Q1, however it is difficult to see how this will be sustained given that its manufacturing sector PMI\u2019s have stayed stuck in contraction for the last eleven months. Germany on the other hand is expected to see a little bit of a slowdown from 0.7% to 0.5% in Q1, while Italy is expected to show its first growth in over a year, coming in at 0.2%, up from 0%. If all these numbers come in as expected the broader EU GDP number is expected to come in at 0.4%. Today\u2019s growth data should show that the European recovery is gaining momentum, write my colleague Katie Allen: Eurozone politicians are hoping for glimmers of a long-awaited economic rebound this week, with growth in the single-currency bloc forecast to beat both the UK and US. Economists expect the lower oil price to have provided a fillip to eurozone growth in the opening months of the year and have pencilled in a 0.5% pick-up in GDP, according to a Reuters poll ahead of Wednesday\u2019s figures. That would be the fastest for four years..... Good morning. Today we discover whether the European recovery is continuing. Countries from across the region are reporting growth figures for the first quarter of 2015, and it could paint a relatively encouraging picture. Economists believe the eurozone could have grown by as much as 0.5% in the first quarter of the year. That would be its strongest growth since 2011. It would also beat the UK, which expanded by 0.3%, and the US which barely managed any growth at all. So why the turnaround, after years of weak growth? The weak euro and cheaper oil prices have both provided a stimulus recently. But credit must also go to the European Central Bank\u2019s new QE scheme, for shoring up confidence and encouraging bank lending. And here are some of the main events... 6.30am BST (7.30am CEST): France 7am: Germany 8am: Austria , Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia 8.30am: The Netherlands 9am: Italy, Poland 9.30am: Portugal 10am: Greece, Cyprus, and the eurozone as a whole. And once that\u2019s all over, the Bank of England will be releasing its latest Quarterly Inflation Report, outlining the state of the UK economy. Press conference from 10.30am. We\u2019ll also have an eye on Greece\u2019s bailout talks, as usual. A busy morning ahead....",

Just recently the burrito bowls made headlines in the US when Hillary Clinton stopped by an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/21/hillary-clinton-chipotle-sales\">Ohio location</a> and ordered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2015/apr/14/hillarys-flawless-chipotle-choice-how-campaign-meals-can-make-or-break-a-politicians-image\">a chicken burrito bowl</a>.</p> <p>The Huhtamaki workers from a number of the facilities in the US are demanding better working conditions, higher pay, healthcare and the right to unionize. Their hope is that if they can get the Chipotle shareholders on their side, they can convince Huhtamaki officers to meet with them and hear their demands.</p> <p>The workers are being supported by the United Steelworkers Union, which is part of the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US. Of Huhtamaki\u2019s 21 facilities in the US, only six are unionized. Employees at four of the other plants are represented by the United Steelworkers Union. </p> <p>\u201cIt might be worth noting that Hutamaki makes our bowls at two different facilities, both of which are unionized,\u201d Chris Arnold, Chipotle spokesman, told the Guardian. \u201cSo Hutamaki employees who make anything for us are members of a union.

      "bodyText": "Protesters gathered outside Chipotle\u2019s headquarters in Denver, Colorado, on Wednesday to urge the shareholders to \u201cput people over pigs\u201d. The crowd of about 50 people gathered outside the building, where the company was having its annual shareholders meeting, to bring attention to the treatment of workers employed by Huhtamaki, which supplies Chipotle with the bowls used for its signature dish: the burrito bowl. Just recently the burrito bowls made headlines in the US when Hillary Clinton stopped by an Ohio location and ordered a chicken burrito bowl. The Huhtamaki workers from a number of the facilities in the US are demanding better working conditions, higher pay, healthcare and the right to unionize. Their hope is that if they can get the Chipotle shareholders on their side, they can convince Huhtamaki officers to meet with them and hear their demands. The workers are being supported by the United Steelworkers Union, which is part of the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US. Of Huhtamaki\u2019s 21 facilities in the US, only six are unionized. Employees at four of the other plants are represented by the United Steelworkers Union. \u201cIt might be worth noting that Hutamaki makes our bowls at two different facilities, both of which are unionized,\u201d Chris Arnold, Chipotle spokesman, told the Guardian. \u201cSo Hutamaki employees who make anything for us are members of a union. We have no relationship with the plant that\u2019s at the center of this issue.\u201d Huhtamaki did not respond to Guardian\u2019s request for comment. Among the protesters is Duane Calloway, 53, a forklift driver at a Huhtamaki plant in Commerce, California. The city is located in the south-east area of Los Angeles County. On Tuesday, Calloway flew to Denver to take part in Wednesday\u2019s actions. AFL-CIO paid for his flight and accommodations. Calloway has worked for the company for over seven years; at the moment he earns almost $15 an hour and works full time. Forklift drivers are among the higher-paid employees at the plants. Some of the machine operators at the plant make as little as $9 an hour, according to the union. It remains to be seen whether Chipotle workers, whose starting salary is $21,000 a year, will support the Huhtamaki workers in their efforts. In April of this year, judge Melissa M Olivero ruled that Chipotle violated labor laws when it threatened workers for discussing their pay and fired Patrick Leeper for missing work in order to join the Show Me $15 protest in 2013. \u201cIt is always a top priority for us to remain compliant with all local and federal labor laws,\u201d Chipotle said at that time. The push for a $15 minimum wage is \u201cthe big fight out here\u201d, Calloway told the Guardian. Even though he is already getting paid almost $15 an hour, he said he knows it could get better. \u201cCompared to other companies that are union, I should be getting more than I am getting.\u201d The efforts to unionize have been on going for more than a year. \u201cOne of my friends \u2013 he has been in the union \u2013 he approached me back in November 2013 and five of us got together and we started working on this,\u201d said Calloway. In an effort to form a union, the workers reached out to local AFL-CIO representatives and \u201chave been going at it since then\u201d. Calloway said that there is support for a union among the workers, but many remain scared. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of older people there.

The union insists the consultants were brought in to persuade workers not to join the union. Wednesday\u2019s protest is Calloway\u2019s first. He said that his wife is supportive of his efforts to unionize his workplace. \u201cShe loves it. She is on disability right now, which is why we really need this union.\u201d he said. \u201cWe live paycheck to paycheck.\u201d This story has been updated to include a comment from Chipotle.",

      "bodyText": "The last time Britain\u2019s unemployment rate was as low as 5.5% was during the period of phoney calm between the run on Northern Rock and the collapse of Lehman Brothers. At that point, with the economy in the early stages of recession, official interest rates were 5%. Over the past year, employment has grown by 564,000, with an additional 202,000 jobs created in the last three months alone. Yet interest rates stand at 0.5%, which is where they have been for the past six years. And, judging by the latest smoke signals from Threadneedle Street, the Bank of England has no intention of raising them any time soon. Why is this? Why is it that an economy that is creating jobs at a healthy lick has borrowing costs lower than they have been in the Bank\u2019s history, a level that was considered a temporary response to a dire calamity back in 2009? The answer is that the UK economy has changed significantly since the pre-financial crisis days. When the jobless rate was last at 5.5%, wages were growing by around 4% a year, while today they are growing at about half that level. In spring 2008, productivity was improving by a bit more than 2% a year, in line with its historic trend. Productivity growth has been non-existent for the past three years and there has been no improvement in the economy\u2019s efficiency since the recession began. The weakness of investment is one reason productivity growth has been so poor, because workers are not using the latest kit. But the Bank points out in its quarterly inflation report that during the past two years employment growth has been concentrated in lower-skill occupations. An increase in the supply of labour means employers have plenty of potential employees to choose from. Half the 568,000 increase in employment growth over the past year was accounted for by inward migration. There are other factors. Low interest rates have allowed some firms to stay afloat that would otherwise have gone out of business. This may have prevented capital from flowing to more innovative companies. There is evidence that businesses have crimped on the development of the skills that make workers more productive. The Bank\u2019s view is that productivity will eventually recover and will return towards, \u2013 but remain below \u2013 pre-crisis rates of growth. It has to be said, however, that Threadneedle Street does not provide a particularly compelling explanation for why this should happen. It has been wrongly anticipating a pick-up in productivity for years. Instead, a more likely path for the economy would appear to be that the UK\u2019s strong employment record attracts more inward migration at the same time as the government\u2019s social security cuts divert people from welfare into work. The supply of labour will remain strong, contrary to the Bank\u2019s forecast, keeping the lid on wages and depressing productivity. On Tuesday, some City analysts were pointing to the slight rise in the rate of earnings growth as a sign of increasing inflationary pressure from the labour market, but this has to be put into perspective. If you take average weekly earnings in the latest three months and compare them to the previous three months, wages are up by a solitary pound. That hardly constitutes a return to the 1970s. To be fair to the Bank, it fully acknowledges that there is a great deal of uncertainty about what will happen to both wages and productivity. But it envisages that next year, there will be a return to the 4% earnings growth that prevailed before the storm broke. That 4% was split pretty much down the middle between 2% inflation and 2% productivity growth. A return to those days looks a long way off. Core inflation (excluding energy, food and budget changes in excise duties) is running at 1% and productivity growth is zero. That explains why the Bank will, quite rightly, be cautious about tightening policy.",

The pound jumped more than a cent against the dollar after the news. Analysts said the rise in wages could push the Bank of England to bring forward its first interest rate rise since 2007 to later this year, rather than in 2016. But sterling fell back an hour after the unemployment statistics were published due to a downbeat outlook for the British economy by the Bank of England. The Bank governor, Mark Carney, cut this year\u2019s UK growth outlook and warned that productivity, the main impetus behind higher wages, remained weak. Markets have expected a rate rise in 2016 after the halving of GDP growth to 0.3% in the first three months of the year. Those investors who considered bringing forward their expectation of a rate rise until this year are likely to sit on their hands as a result of Carney\u2019s comments.

The drop of 35,000 in the number of unemployed people took the total to 1.82 million, a seven-year low.

      "bodyText": "Incentive plans that have allowed bosses at companies including advertising giant WPP to collect tens of millions of pounds in pay should be abolished, according to a committee of independent experts. The complex multi-year pay deals known as long-term incentive plans or LTIPs, now a feature of most FTSE 100 bosses\u2019 remuneration, have driven executive pay up to \u201cunwarranted levels\u201d without delivering the same improvement in company performance, according to a report. \u201cWe need to recognise the flaws in the system and stop paying CEOs on metrics that encourage gaming,\u201d the authors said. \u201cWe have looked at the growing complexity of awards that has pushed directors\u2019 pay into the stratosphere and found there is little discernible link with corporate success. In fact, there is an argument that it is actually damaging the economy.\u201d Produced by a commission convened by the High Pay Centre, whose members included Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, and former Hermes fund manager David Pitt-Watson, the report concludes a year-long inquiry into how corporate Britain\u2019s top brass are rewarded. City economist Andrew Smithers, also on the committee, argues that many pay plans effectively encourage executives to slash investment \u2013 either in equipment or human resources \u2013 to a potentially unsustainable level, while pursuing speculative takeovers and concentrating resources on share buybacks in order to increase the share price, boosting their LTIP payouts \u2013 which are usually in the form of shares in the company. LTIP payments to FTSE 350 directors increased by more than 250% between 2000 and 2013, about five times as fast as returns to shareholders, the report says. Evidence that performance-related pay actually improved performance was weak, said the report\u2019s authors, while targets linked to profits and the share price can \u201ccreate perverse incentives that are damaging to businesses and the wider economy in the long-term\u201d. WPP founder and chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s long-term pay plan, which sparked repeated shareholder protests, boosted his total pay to \u00a330m in 2013 and \u00a343m in 2014, making him the best paid UK public company boss two years running. At Cable &amp; Wireless, a notoriously value destroying demerger saw the telecoms company split in two and its top executives share some \u00a388m in LTIP rewards over five years, just as the share price collapsed. Energy company BG Group was forced to cut the \u00a325m it promised incoming boss Helge Lund earlier this year. The debacle was followed by protests this spring at Man Group and RSA Insurance, where chief executive Stephen Hester\u2019s comparatively modest \u00a35m package was rebuffed by about 16% of investors. \u201cPerformance-related pay has failed on its own terms,\u201d said High Pay Centre founding director Deborah Hargreaves. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t encourage or reward good business performance. The only effect it has is to make executive pay packages more complex, less aligned with the interests of the company and much, much bigger.\u201d Annual bonus payments should be made in cash and not shares, according to the committee, to prevent executives benefiting from sudden increases in the share price triggered, for example, by takeover bids. It said \u201cgolden hello\u201d payments of the kind proffered to Lund should not be made unless the position being filled had been advertised as part of an open recruitment process and recommended that the corporate remuneration committees that set pay should include people from a wider range of backgrounds. The typical remuneration committee member is paid about 16 times the UK average, research by the Trades Union Congress has found, and more than a third of committee members are themselves executives of other companies. LTIPs usually constitute the largest element of executive pay. They are typically three years in length and were used by about 90% of FTSE 100 companies in 2013, up from 30% in the mid-1990s. Over the same period, the average value of LTIP payments to FTSE 100 lead executives increased from 40% of pay to more than 200%. The so-called shareholder spring that brought the first big protest votes over pay in 2012 has returned in 2015, with revolts in recent weeks at the bookmaker Ladbrokes, satellite operator Inmarsat and broker Tullet Prebon. Last month, British Gas owner Centrica also faced a row over pay for its new boss, Iain Conn, when one in three investors failed to back his deal.",

The only effect it has is to make executive pay packages more complex, less aligned with the interests of the company and much, much bigger.\u201d</p> <p>Annual bonus payments should be made in cash and not shares, according to the committee, to prevent executives benefiting from sudden increases in the share price triggered, for example, by takeover bids.</p> <p>It said \u201cgolden hello\u201d payments of the kind proffered to Lund should not be made unless the position being filled had been advertised as part of an open recruitment process and recommended that the corporate remuneration committees that set pay should include people from a wider range of backgrounds.</p> <p>The typical remuneration committee member is paid about 16 times the UK average, research by the Trades Union Congress has found, and more than a third of committee members are themselves executives of other companies.</p> <p>LTIPs usually constitute the largest element of executive pay. They are typically three years in length and were used by about 90% of FTSE 100 companies in 2013, up from 30% in the mid-1990s. Over the same period, the average value of LTIP payments to FTSE 100 lead executives increased from 40% of pay to more than 200%.</p> <p>The so-called shareholder spring that brought the first big protest votes over pay in 2012 has returned in 2015, with revolts in recent weeks at the bookmaker Ladbrokes, satellite operator Inmarsat and broker Tullet Prebon. Last month, British Gas owner Centrica also faced a row over pay for its new boss, Iain Conn, when one in three investors failed to back his deal.</p>",
