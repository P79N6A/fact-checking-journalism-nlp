      "bodyText": "GKN, the FTSE 100 aerospace and automotive company which issued a shock profit warning in November, has rejected an unsolicited \u00a37bn approach from rival Melrose and announced plans to split in two. A bid battle is now likely as Melrose, which specialises in buying struggling businesses, turning them round and selling them at a profit with the proceeds given back to shareholders, will pursue its interest despite GKN\u2019s opposition. GKN\u2019s shares jumped by more than a quarter to an all-time closing high of 420p on the news, above the initial 405p cash and share offer on the table from Melrose. But Melrose shares subsequently climbed 6%, lifting the value of its offer to 419p a share. Analyst Sandy Morris at Jefferies said the Melrose move could draw out rival bidders, such as US group Spirit AeroSystems or Germany\u2019s tyre and automotive group Continental. Private equity companies could also be interested. GKN said the Melrose approach was \u201centirely opportunistic\u201d and undervalued the company. But Melrose responded, saying: \u201c[We believe] that there would be significant operational and commercial benefits arising from Melrose\u2019s ownership of GKN\u2019s businesses, reversing a history of existing GKN management not delivering on margin targets.\u201d Melrose chief executive Simon Peckham added: \u201cWe think it has a good business which is underperforming. The fight is about who is best placed to manage the business properly. It\u2019s really down to the shareholders now.\u201d The proposed takeover was immediately criticised by Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable, who said it was a serious threat to the government\u2019s industrial strategy and accused Melrose of \u201casset stripping\u201d. But Peckham dismissed the charge. In a reference to GKN\u2019s plan to split in two, he said: \u201cThe only bit of financial engineering being announced is by the board of GKN, not us. We have a great record of investing in businesses.\u201d GKN, which used to be known as Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds and traces its history back to 1759, has struggled in recent years and its profit warning came after a downturn in its US aerospace business. It expects to write down between \u00a380m and \u00a3130m as the value of stocks at the division had been overestimated. The biggest factory, in St Louis in Missouri, makes air frames for F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets. Following the warning, its proposed chief executive Kevin Cummings was ousted from the business even before he took up the post and was replaced by non-executive director Anne Stevens on a temporary basis. Now Stevens, a former senior executive at Ford, has been handed the job permanently. GKN said Stevens had conducted a review which would lead to the company splitting its aerospace division \u2013 formed by the purchase of a stake in Westland helicopters in 1988 \u2013 from its automotive business. It said both businesses would benefit from being separate companies with distinct investment profiles and capital allocation policies. But Melrose maintained it would be better to improve the performances of both divisions before any split. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe separation of the automotive and aerospace units has been on the cards for years, with little obvious crossover between the two businesses. Historically, the pension deficit has held the group together, but with the sprawling footprint likely to have contributed to recent profit warnings, the reasons for divorce now seem to outweigh the costs of splitting. \u201cThe money to be made from a split is likely to have been what drew turnaround specialist Melrose to the table in the first place \u2013 the challenge for newly confirmed chief executive Anne Stevens is to deliver a better result for shareholders than the 405p she turned down today.\u201d GKN said current trading was in line with expectations, with 2017 profits expected to be slightly ahead of the 2016 figure of \u00a3678m before the US write-off. Melrose said it had approached GKN a week ago and given the company a deadline of Friday to respond, but instead GKN went public about the proposed deal. Melrose now has until 9 February either to make a firm bid or walk away. The three men who built Melrose into a \u00a34.4bn business The key directors behind Melrose have a track record of buying up underperforming companies, turning them round and selling them on at a profit. Christopher Miller was a protege of Lord Hanson, the 1980s wheeler dealer who built up a corporate empire with a number of aggressive takeovers. After leaving Hanson, Miller bought into small shoe retailer Wassall, alongside David Roper, an accountant who had previously been at Warburg merchant bank and whom he worked with in Switzerland before his Hanson days. Along with Peckham, a solicitor, they turned Wassall from a company worth just \u00a31.9m into a wide-ranging engineering business, thanks to a series of ever larger takeovers. Roper was given the nickname \u201cthe Grinder\u201d, supposedly for his detailed financial analysis of companies targeted for takeover. Eventually Wassall was itself sold to US buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for \u00a3672m in 2000. After spending a couple of years doing little but improving their golf handicaps, according to Roper, he and Miller teamed up with Peckham again to set up Melrose. They put in \u00a33m of their own money and floated the company on Aim in 2003 with a market capitalisation of \u00a310m. Once more they used the company to mount a series of acquisitions \u2013 diecast specialist Dynacast, engineering groups McKechnie, metering business Elster among them \u2013 before disposing of them and returning the proceeds to shareholders. Melrose\u2019s current businesses are ventilation equipment manufacturer Nortek and generating equipment group Brush. Miller, Roper and Peckham, along with Melrose finance director Geoff Martin, hit the headlines last year when it emerged that they would share a bonus pot of \u00a3160m, one of the biggest corporate paydays in the City. Setting out their philosphy, Roper once said: \u201cWe find fundamentally good businesses which are badly managed but need a change of culture.\u201d A takeover of GKN would be their biggest deal yet, and their biggest challenge.

      "bodyText": "The UK financial regulator has been accused of \u201csleepwalking into another huge misselling scandal\u201d by a Labour MP, after an investigation into how thousands of former steelworkers may have lost out following complex pension transfers that earned financial advisers large fees. Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions select committee, accused the Financial Conduct Authority of failing to protect steelworkers who were part of the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) amid concerns of a \u201cfeeding frenzy\u201d by financial advisers. Tata was forced to offload the \u00a315bn BSPS to pave the way for a 50-50 merger of its European operations with Germany\u2019s ThyssenKrupp to create the second biggest steel producer in Europe after ArcelorMittal. But more than 2,000 steelworkers subsequently transferred out of their final-salary schemes after receiving allegedly unsuitable advice. The FCA is now broadening its probe into the pensions advice given to people leaving final salary-style pension schemes, demanding information from 45 advisory firms. But Field suggested that regulatory action had been too slow, despite considerable warning signals. He said the FCA ordered one financial adviser, Active Wealth, to cease advising on new pension business but the move was \u201c14 months after it first started digging, and just weeks before the original deadline for BSPS members to make a decision on their pension\u201d. He added that while Active Wealth was \u201calready on their radar\u201d the FCA first contacted the firm about pension scheme in November 2017 \u2013 two months after BBC investigators presented it with evidence they had uncovered. Active Wealth was one of two financial adviser firms that were called to appear in front of the committee but failed to attend. Information subsequently supplied reveals that Active Wealth handled transfers worth an average of nearly \u00a3400,000 for each steel worker, \u201crepresenting upwards of \u00a340m transferred out of BSPS on their advice alone\u201d. Questions remain over how much the workers paid their advisers, said Field. \u201cThe highest and average fees paid to them so far [were] described as \u00a31,500 and \u00a31,443 respectively. The fees seem very small relative to the huge transfer values and it is unclear how many BSPS clients signed up to an ongoing adviser charge or what that might cost them ultimately in total.\u201d Field said: \u201cFrom their intervention in this affair it seems clear that the FCA\u2019s actions still effectively protect these businesses\u2019 ability to make money out of pension funds, rather than protecting pension savers. They must take care they are not sleepwalking into yet another huge misselling scandal.\u201d A letter sent to Field by Megan Butler, the FCA\u2019s head of supervision, promised to extend an earlier probe of 13 pension advisory firms where the evidence suggested that only half gave suitable advice. The regulator said in a statement: \u201cThe Financial Conduct Authority wholly rejects the conclusion of the committee about our actions on BSPS. The FCA strongly believes that we have taken all the appropriate action we can within our remit on this issue.\u201d In its response to the committee, Active Wealth said it had fully complied with regulatory rules and that its \u201capproach has been to act in the best interests of its clients and to provide advice which is tailored to meet the client\u2019s investment objectives\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The pound has surged to its highest level against the dollar since the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU following reports that Spain and the Netherlands are willing to back a soft Brexit deal. Sterling hit a high of $1.3691, a gain of almost 1.5 cents \u2013 more than 1% \u2013 after Bloomberg reported that the two countries were keen to maintain the closest possible ties between the EU and Britain, after Brexit. The pound was changing hands for $1.49 before the Brexit vote on 23 June 2016, but plunged when it became clear the British public had voted to leave the EU. It hit a low of about $1.20 in January 2017. Bloomberg reported: \u201cSpanish economy minister Luis de Guindos and his Dutch counterpart Wopke Hoekstra met earlier this week and discussed their common interests in Brexit, according to the person. \u201cBoth have close trade and investment ties and are concerned about the impact of tariffs. They are also worried about losing UK contributions to the EU budget, the person said.\u201d A spokesman for Spain\u2019s economy ministry said the two finance chiefs discussed the importance of the UK for both countries, and agreed to keep talking on their common interests while at the same time backing Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator. A spokesman for Hoekstra declined to comment. However Neil Jones, head of European hedge-fund sales at the Japanese bank Mizuho, played down the significance of the discussions. \u201cIt\u2019s not so significant as the rally would suggest. Just because two of the 27 members say this, it doesn\u2019t mean a softer Brexit will happen. I doubt it\u2019s as straightforward as that.\u201d Analysts said the pound was also boosted by a broader weakness in the dollar. \u201cSterling jumped 1% today to reach its best level since the Brexit vote after a bout of dollar weakness and some good news on Brexit delivered another boost to pound bulls,\u201d said Neil Wilson, a senior market analyst at ETX Capital. The pound was also up slightly against the euro at \u20ac1.1256, but with the single currency itself strong after news of a breakthrough in German coalition talks, the rise was limited to about 0.1%. The sharp fall in sterling since the Brexit vote has pushed up the cost of goods and services imported from abroad. As a result inflation has risen from 0.5% in June 2016 \u2013 the month of the referendum \u2013 to 3.1% in November, putting increased strain on household finances as UK wage growth fails to keep pace with price rises. However, British exports have become more competitive. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) earlier this week showed UK factories boosted their output for an eighth consecutive month in November, an achievement last seen in May 1994.",

      "bodyText": "The FTSE is still climbing, putting it on course for a new record close. Markets are up on both sides of the Atlantic. In Europe: And in the US: That\u2019s it for today. Thanks for the comments and please join us again on Monday. Have a good weekend. AM The rise in the pound seems to be down to this report from Bloomberg: Spanish and Dutch finance ministers have agreed to work together to push for a Brexit deal that keeps Britain as close to the European Union as possible, according to a person familiar with the situation. Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos and his Dutch counterpart Wopke Hoekstra met earlier this week and discussed their common interests in Brexit, according to the person. Both have close trade and investment ties and are concerned about the impact of tariffs. They are also worried about losing UKv contributions to the EU budget, the person said. The pound is at the highest level against the dollar since the referendum: Big day for the pound! It has hit the highest level against the dollar since the EU referendum in June 2016. The pound surged to $1.3691, apparently on reports that Spain and the Netherlands are willing to back a soft Brexit. It hasn\u2019t been that high since the result of the referendum was clear on 24 June 2016. At that point the pound was at $1.49. The pound also picked up against the euro, currently up 0.1% at \u20ac1.1263. The headline consumer price index increased by 0.1% in December, according to data from the US Labor Department. It was below the 0.2% predicted by economists polled by Reuters survey and took the annual rate to 2.1%. US retail sales rose 0.4% last months as consumers bought a range of goods in the runup to Christmas. The Commerce Department revised the figure for November to show growth of 0.9%, up from an earlier estimate of 0.8%. Sales were up 4.2% in 2017, compared with 3.2% in 2016. US inflation and retail sales data due at 1.30pm UK time will give the latest insight into the state of the world\u2019s largest economy. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC, looks ahead to the figures: If today\u2019s US CPI (consumer price inflation) numbers show a ... weak tone questions may once again be asked as to the likely pace of US rate rises this year, as well as some puzzlement as to why recent sharp rises in oil and other commodity prices aren\u2019t showing up in the headline rates. Expectations are for monthly CPI to come in at 0.1%, down from 0.4% in November while the annual rate is expected to show a drop to 2.1% from 2.2%. Of more importance will be US retail sales for December after the strong performance in November of 0.8%, and the Black Friday effect. Can the momentum of this November number carry over to Cyber Monday as well as the lead up to Christmas with another decent number? With wage growth in the US above the level of headline inflation you would like to think so and a number of 0.5% is expected. A half decent number here could well give the greenback a lift, after yesterday\u2019s sharp fall. European markets have built on earlier gains, and are up across the board: Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, has taken a look at the currency markets: The euro was pretty damn ebullient this Friday following the news that Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU were moving to the next stage of their German coalition talks with the Social Democrats. Combine that with the lingering effects of yesterday\u2019s ECB meeting minutes, which were read to be hawkish by investors, and the euro rocketed 0.8% higher against the dollar, taking it to a brand spanking new 3-year peak. The dollar\u2019s issues weren\u2019t just against the euro \u2013 the greenback also plunged 0.7% against the pound, allowing cable to tease its own 4-month high. It appears the dollar was softened up by yesterday\u2019s disappointing US producer price inflation reading, allowing fears over today\u2019s prospective dip in both inflation and retail sales. Of course the Dow Jones\u2019 many multinationals are more than fine with the dollar\u2019s decline, putting the US index on track for a 25,700-tickling half a percent climb when the bell rings on Wall Street. GKN\u2019s shares have jumped by more than a quarter to an all-time high of 420p, above the initial 405p cash and share offer on the table from turnaround specialist Melrose. But Melrose shares have subsequently climbed 7%, lifting the value of the offer to 422p a share. Analysts at Jefferies said the company could be worth as much as 504p a share. Anxiety over falling real pay is entrenched throughout the UK workforce, irrespective of income level, according to a report out this morning from the Royal Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. The thinktank - whose chief executive, Matthew Taylor, recently led an employment review for the prime minister - said the link between employment and economic security had been \u201cfundamentally broken\u201d since the 2008 financial crash. Read the full story here: The pound is up 0.6% against the dollar, at $1.3617. It is the highest since 20 September 2017. Sterling\u2019s gain reflects the broader weakness of the dollar, which is down against the euro and a basket of other major currencies. Alvin Tan, currency strategist at Societe Generale, explains: Sterling is benefiting from the dollar weakness and the growing euro strength rather than any pound-specific factors, which if anything have been underwhelming this week. The pound is currently down 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1230. GKN is by far the biggest FTSE riser this morning, with shares in the firm hitting an all-time high: Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, gives his take: GKN has made up for years of lumbering progress in a flash. A takeover offer, subsequent rejection, new chief executive, transformation strategy, trading update and planned separation of the business all in one go \u2013 it\u2019s hard to describe GKN as a Mondeo now! The separation of the automotive and aerospace units has been on the cards for years, with little obvious cross over between the two businesses. Historically, the pension deficit has held the group together, but with the sprawling footprint likely to have contributed to recent profit warnings, the reasons for divorce now seem to outweigh the costs of splitting. The money to be made from a split is likely to have been what drew turnaround specialist Melrose to the table in the first place \u2013 the challenge for newly confirmed chief executive Anne Stevens is to deliver a better result for shareholders than the 405p she turned down today. Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats and the former business secretary, doesn\u2019t appear to be a fan of Melrose: Melrose is pressing ahead with its \u00a37bn hostile approach for GKN, which has been unanimously rejected by the board of the engineering giant. Melrose has issued its own statement in response to the one put out by GKN, essentially saying it will carry on regardless. The turnaround specialist believes that it can \u201cre-energise and re-purpose\u201d GKN. Melrose says: Melrose believes that there would be significant operational and commercial benefits arising from Melrose\u2019s ownership of GKN\u2019s businesses, reversing a history of existing GKN management not delivering on margin targets. GKN announced today its intention to separate the businesses. Melrose believes that shareholder value would be maximised by it significantly improving the businesses prior to any separation. The potential acquisition represents a significant opportunity for Melrose to execute on its strategy of maximising inherent value of specialised industrial businesses it owns. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey has urged the government to take action to limit the consequence of a potential collapse of construction giant Carillion. The government is one of Carillion\u2019s biggest clients, working across the NHS and education and on major contracts such as HS2. Long-Bailey says: The collapse of Carillion could provoke a serious crisis. It would have major implications for the outsourced government contracts the company holds, as well as the firm\u2019s thousands of workers, those in the supply chain and those who rely on Carillion\u2019s pension fund. The government, who despite warnings carried on with its programme of outsourcing public services to this company, must stand ready to bring these contracts back into public control, stabilise the situation and safeguard our public services. Read the full story here: The euro is at a three-year high against the dollar after a breakthrough in German coalition talks. News that Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democratic Union bloc and the centre-left Social Democrats have cleared a first hurdle towards the formation of the next German government sent the euro up as high as \u20ac1.2136 at one point- the highest since December 2014. The euro is up 0.8% against the dollar at a $1.2120: Over to Greece now where workers are staging a mass walk-out in opposition to a proposed new wave of reforms and austerity measures. One of the most contentious measures would restrict the right to call industrial action. Helena Smith reports from Athens: In what is being billed the first major industrial action of the year, public and private sector workers have staged a walk-out. Transport workers, seamen, state doctors, bureaucrats and construction workers, have all voiced opposition to the measures demanded by international creditors if debt-stricken Greece is to complete its latest bailout compliance review. The multi-bill, widely seen as the last one before Greece exits bailout supervision, contains some of the harshest reforms yet. Unions and labour groups are particularly incensed by a new law that will restrict the right to call strikes and is much the focus of today\u2019s protests. Leading members of prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist Syriza party have also expressed vehement opposition. Tsipras has urged them to see the bigger picture, arguing the measures are a necessary evil if the country is to regain economic independence and return to capital markets to borrow funds required to refinance its staggering debt mountain. Parliament is expected on 15 January to vote through the contentious bill. The government must legislate about 100 \u2018prior actions\u2019 if time-tables are to be kept and further rescue funds dispensed at the next EU leaders\u2019 summit on 22 January. Europe\u2019s major markets are all up this morning, with the exception of France\u2019s CAC which is roughly flat. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,770 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.2% at 13,224 France\u2019s CAC: flat at 5,489 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 23,390 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.4% at 10,479 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: flat at 397 The bid for GKN by Melrose might be considered audacious, given its smaller market value. Shares in both companies are up sharply after news of the approach emerged. GKN is top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, while Melrose is the FTSE 250\u2019s biggest riser. Garry White, chief investment commentator at Charles Stanley, says Melrose might be onto something: So after the day was looking a little thin on corporate news, GKN has delivered the goods with a triple whammy of news: The company, valued at \u00a37.2bn, has rejected an \u201cunsolicited\u201d offer of 405p a share from Melrose. GKN shares are currently up 25% at 416p GKN said it intends to separate its automotive and aerospace businesses, \u201crecognising the strategic optionality for shareholders in having separate companies with distinct investment profiles and capital allocation policies\u201d Anne Stevens, currently interim chief executive, will take on the top job with immediate effect, the company said GKN shares have jumped 24% this morning after the engineering giant said it had rejected an \u201cunsolicited\u201d offer of 405p a share from turnaround specialist Melrose. In a statement to the stock exchange, GKN (which makes parts for the car and aerospace industry), explained: The board of GKN has considered the proposal together with its financial advisers ... and has unanimously rejected it, having concluded that the proposal is entirely opportunistic and that the terms fundamentally undervalue the company and its prospects. GKN shares are currently trading at 413p and the jump pushed the FTSE 100 to a new intraday high of 7,774 at one point. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The FTSE 100 is up in early trading, following a fresh record close on Thursday and another record finish on Wall Street. It is up 0.05% at 7,766. The index of the UK\u2019s leading shares is up despite a 0.4% dip in the price of Brent crude oil to $68.94 a barrel. After a flurry of Christmas trading updates from UK retailers on Thursday, it\u2019s a much quieter day on the corporate front. An exception is discount retailer B&amp;M, which has reported a sharp increase in sales over Christmas period after opening more than 30 new UK stores over the last nine months. Also coming up: 1.30pm GMT: US retail sales for December will reveal whether or not consumers in the world\u2019s largest economy had the appetite to spend in the runup to Christmas 1.30pm GMT: US inflation data for December will be viewed in the context of the next move on rates by the Fed",

      "bodyText": "Anxiety over future job and pay prospects has become entrenched among UK workers against a backdrop of falling living standards, Brexit uncertainty and the prospect of automation, a report has warned. Four out of five working people are concerned that inflation will outstrip their pay in future, despite high levels of employment, the Royal Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce said. The thinktank \u2013 whose chief executive, Matthew Taylor, recently led an employment review for the prime minister, Theresa May, \u2013 said anxiety about falling real pay was widespread across all income bands as it warned the link between employment and economic security had been \u201cfundamentally broken\u201d since the 2008 financial crash. \u201cHaving a job is no longer a guarantor of economic security: more than 7 million people in working households live in poverty, wage growth lagged behind inflation for most of the last decade, and close to 8 million people in the UK live with problem debt,\u201d said Atif Shafique, a senior researcher at the RSA. \u201cTen years after the crash, and we need a step change. Community, place, identity and personal responsibility all have an important role to play,\u201d he said. The study of more than 2,000 adults, carried out by Populus for RSA, argues that a new focus on economic security is needed to meet working Britain\u2019s challenges in the 2020s, as automation leaps forward. RSA also called for a universal basic income to complement paid work, providing everyone with a means to save. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said the pay crisis in Britain should be the government\u2019s first priority. \u201cWorking people are in the middle of the longest pay squeeze since Napoleonic times, with real wages still lower than before the financial crisis,\u201d she said. The financial crisis took a heavy toll on UK living standards, as prices roses faster than wages in the six years from 2008. Following a brief respite in 2015 and 2016, falling real pay returned in 2017 as the sharp fall in the value of the pound, triggered by the Brexit vote, drove up the cost of imported goods and fed higher inflation. Inflation rose from 0.5% in June 2016 \u2013 the month of the referendum \u2013 to 3.1% in November. Wage growth has failed to keep pace, despite low unemployment, and was 2.3% in October. The TUC said its own analysis of figures from the Office for National Statistics found that while UK corporate profitability rose to 12.6% in 2017 from 11.4% in 2007, real wages over the same period fell by 4.4%. \u201cWorking people aren\u2019t getting their fair share. Profitability is up, but real wages are still in freefall,\u201d O\u2019Grady said. \u201cNot only does Britain deserve a pay rise, but this evidence shows that business can afford it too.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The private equity backers of discount retailer B&amp;M have banked \u00a31bn from their investment in the discount chain which sells cut price curtains, biscuits and pet food. Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice (CD&amp;R) has sold its holding in the retailer in a series of tranches and on Friday sold its remaining 5% stake for \u00a3200m as it cashed in on strong Christmas trading in its stores. In total the investor will have made \u00a31.5bn out of the chain\u2019s 2014 stock exchange listing. CD&amp;R is thought to have paid the Arora brothers, the entrepreneurs who turned B&amp;M into a national discount chain, more than \u00a3500m for a 60% stake in 2012. The Aroras, whose father ran a cash and carry in Manchester, bought B&amp;M in 2005. The Arora family has also made more than \u00a31bn from share sales to date. Brothers Simon, Bobby and Robin have all been involved in the business but Simon, the eldest, is the chief executive. They shared an initial \u00a31bn payout with CD&amp;R when B&amp;M made its market debut in June 2014. When it listed B&amp;M\u2019s shares were worth 270p but on Friday they closed up 5% at 417p after the retailer reported strong Christmas figures. The brothers are estimated to be worth close to \u00a32bn by the Sunday Times Rich List. B&amp;M is chaired by former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy, who is also a CD&amp;R adviser. The investment will also have been a lucrative one for Leahy, who is stepping down as chairman in March. But it is not clear how much he has made because his interest was held via a Cayman Islands registered fund, which controlled CD&amp;R\u2019s stake. Despite its roots in Blackpool \u2013 it was founded by Malcolm Billington in Lancashire resort town in 1976 \u2013 B&amp;M is officially headquartered in Luxembourg. Christmas proved to be a tough period for retailers but B&amp;M emerged as a winner as hard-up shoppers headed to its stores for cut-price chocolates, toys and alcohol. Its blue and orange stores have become a magnet for shoppers who fill their trollies with household brands such as Kellogg\u2019s, Whiskas and Walkers, which are sold more cheaply than in the more established supermarkets. In the months leading up to December, Britons put the brakes on spending as inflation, which is running at about 3.7%, forced shoppers to cut non-essential purchases as they struggled to absorb higher food bills. With shoppers on the hunt for the best deals B&amp;M\u2019s UK chain clocked up like-for-like sales growth of 3.9% in the 13 weeks to 23 December. Total sales climbed nearly 13% to \u00a3837.3m as the retailer expanded to 569 stores. \u201cB&amp;M continues to go from strength to strength,\u201d said Simon Arora, who is chief executive of its parent company, B&amp;M European Value Retail. \u201cDespite the demanding comparatives from the very strong Christmas in 2016, our buying, supply chain and retail teams achieved another outstanding performance this year by doing what we do best, which is delivering great value for customers week in, week out.\u201d Bryan Roberts, the global insights director at the retail marketing firm TCC Global, said B&amp;M\u2019s success came at the expense of the big four supermarket chains, which all lost market share over Christmas. \u201cB&amp;M\u2019s pricing is superb,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cYou can now do a pretty decent branded shop there across food, drink, cleaning products and grocery, health and beauty. You do still find packs of Kellogg\u2019s with the writing in Arabic, but more and more big suppliers are waking up to the opportunity and selling direct to them.\u201d Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

The investment will also have been a lucrative one for Leahy, who is stepping down as chairman in March. But it is not clear how much he has made because his interest was held via a Cayman Islands registered fund, which controlled CD&amp;R\u2019s stake. </p> <p>Despite its roots in Blackpool \u2013 it was founded by Malcolm Billington in Lancashire resort town in 1976 \u2013 B&amp;M is officially headquartered in Luxembourg.</p> <p>Christmas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/11/tesco-and-john-lewis-enjoy-a-good-christmas-but-ms-downbeat\">proved to be a tough period for retailers</a> but B&amp;M emerged as a winner as hard-up shoppers headed to its stores for cut-price chocolates, toys and alcohol. </p> <p>Its blue and orange stores have become a magnet for shoppers who fill their trollies with household brands such as Kellogg\u2019s, Whiskas and Walkers, which are sold more cheaply than in the more established supermarkets.</p> <p>In the months leading up to December, Britons put the brakes on spending as inflation, which is running at about 3.7%, forced shoppers to cut non-essential purchases as they struggled to absorb higher food bills.</p> <p>With shoppers on the hunt for the best deals B&amp;M\u2019s UK chain clocked up like-for-like sales growth of 3.9% in the 13 weeks to 23 December. Total sales climbed nearly 13% to \u00a3837.3m as the retailer expanded to 569 stores.</p> <p>\u201cB&amp;M continues to go from strength to strength,\u201d said Simon Arora, who is chief executive of its parent company, B&amp;M European Value Retail. \u201cDespite the demanding comparatives from the very strong Christmas in 2016, our buying, supply chain and retail teams achieved another outstanding performance this year by doing what we do best, which is delivering great value for customers week in, week out.\u201d</p> <p>Bryan Roberts, the global insights director at the retail marketing firm TCC Global, said B&amp;M\u2019s success came at the expense of the big four supermarket chains, which all lost market share over Christmas.</p> <p>\u201cB&amp;M\u2019s pricing is superb,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cYou can now do a pretty decent branded shop there across food, drink, cleaning products and grocery, health and beauty. You do still find packs of Kellogg\u2019s with the writing in Arabic, but more and more big suppliers are waking up to the opportunity and selling direct to them.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.<br></em></li> </ul>",
