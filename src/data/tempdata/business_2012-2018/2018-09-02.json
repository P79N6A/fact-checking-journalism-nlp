      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley faces a potential shareholder revolt at Sports Direct\u2019s annual meeting next week amid claims of his \u201ccontinued failures\u201d as chief executive of the sportswear company, including a proposed multimillion-pound payment to his daughter\u2019s fianc\u00e9. Two shareholder advisory groups are urging investors to vote against the re-election of Ashley and the company\u2019s chairman, Keith Hellawell, over the retailer\u2019s poor treatment of employees and alleged poor governance. The row comes three weeks after Ashley\u2019s sportswear group snapped up the department store chain House of Fraser for \u00a390m. Ashley is currently in talks with landlords over how many of House of Fraser\u2019s 59 outlets will close. In a voting advice, Pensions &amp; Investment Research Consultants (Pirc) said governance worries included \u201cthe excessive influence of Mike Ashley over the board and the running of the company\u201d, and the fact there were no female directors on the board, which was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d. It also claimed that the board had \u201cconsistently failed\u201d to deal with concerns about employment practices that were the subject of a scathing MPs\u2019 report in 2016, which branded conditions as those akin to a \u201cVictorian workhouse\u201d. A second advisory group, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), said there were \u201congoing operational, governance and risk oversight concerns\u201d, and it criticised the company\u2019s \u201capparent unwillingness\u201d to address the worries of independent shareholders. It said these concerns had been \u201cexacerbated\u201d this year by the appointment of Michael Murray, Ashley\u2019s future son-in-law, to a key management role \u2013 his title is \u201chead of elevation\u201d \u2013 alongside a proposal to pay him \u00a35m for his property consultancy work. ISS and Pirc both criticised Hellawell, a former police chief constable and ex-government \u201cdrugs tsar\u201d, with the former saying that previous no-confidence votes from independent shareholders suggested that his continuation in the position of chairman was \u201cnot tenable\u201d, and the latter highlighting \u201cconcerns over the lack of leadership ... due to the influence of the chief executive\u201d. As a result, both shareholder advisory groups are recommending that Sports Direct investors vote against Ashley, who owns 61% of the company, and Hellawell at the meeting in central London on 12 September. They are also calling for shareholders to oppose the re-election of the non-executive director Simon Bentley, who is chairman of Sports Direct\u2019s audit committee. Murray, who turns 29 this month, was put in charge of Sports Direct\u2019s property in 2015. However, ISS said the potential \u00a35m payment to his company MM Prop Consultancy was not subject to shareholder approval, and added that even though he was technically an outside contractor, the contract on offer was \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than that of Jon Kempster, Sports Direct\u2019s recently appointed chief financial officer, whose base salary is \u00a3150,000. Murray began his career running festivals and student nights while still at Reading University, and he met Anna Ashley on holiday in Majorca in 2011. The couple now reportedly live together in a \u00a310m home in Belgravia, central London. Sports Direct\u2019s finances have also been under scrutiny of late: in July the firm said its pre-tax profits fell 72.5% to \u00a378m. Meanwhile, a Guardian investigation in 2015 had found that temporary workers at the company were effectively receiving hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. Sports Direct recently raised the stakes in its negotiations with House of Fraser store owners, warning that it would be the fault of \u201cgreedy landlords\u201d if hundreds of retail jobs were lost as a result of looming closures. Last week, a report named Sports Direct as \u201cthe UK\u2019s least reputable retailer\u201d. The claim was made by the Reputation Institute, which describes itself as the world\u2019s leading research and advisory firm for reputation. It said the sports retailer performed worst on four measures in the report: workplace, governance, citizenship and leadership. A spokesperson for Sports Direct said: \u201cWe hope shareholders will continue to recognise the further positive progress that we have made over the last 12 months.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s leading role in evaluating new medicines for sale to patients across the EU has collapsed with no more work coming from Europe because of Brexit, it has emerged. The decision by the European Medicines Agency to cut Britain out of its contracts seven months ahead of Brexit is a devastating blow to British pharmaceutical companies already reeling from the loss of the EMA\u2019s HQ in London and with it 900 jobs. All drugs sold in Europe have to go through a lengthy EMA authorisation process before use by health services, and the Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in Britain has built up a leading role in this work, with 20-30% of all assessments in the EU. The MHRA won just two contracts this year and the EMA said that that work was now off limits. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even allocate the work now for new drugs because the expert has to be available throughout the evaluation period and sometimes that can take a year,\u201d said a spokeswoman. In a devastating second blow, existing contracts with the MHRA are also being reallocated to bloc members. Martin McKee, the professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who has given evidence to select committees about Brexit, said it was a disaster for the MHRA, which had about \u00a314m a year from the EMA. The head of the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry said it was akin to watching a \u201cBritish success story\u201d being broken up. Mike Thompson, the chief executive of the association, said: \u201cClearly we\u2019ve all been incredibly proud of the MHRA\u2019s role over the last few years. They\u2019d established themselves as one of the most respected regulators across all of Europe and industry. It\u2019s been a British success story.\u201d The EMA said that because of the long lead-time involved in assessing medicines it could no longer award the lead contracts to British people since there was no guarantee they would be part of the EU after March 2019. It is understood the MHRA bid for 36 EMA contracts this year but were only awarded two, and these were for drugs for which evaluation had already begun. The situation is a stark contrast to 2016 when the UK was the lead assessor, known as the rapporteur, on 22 applications, and was joint lead or co-rapporteur on 19 multinational applications. This made it the number one in Europe, with Germany\u2019s regulator behind with 22 lead contracts but only 12 co-contracts. The EMA now also requires all existing drugs assessors to transfer their personal knowledge of their specialist fields to counterparts in a European member state. \u201cYou might have been working on a cancer drug for decades and built up so much expertise and you are the absolute specialist in your field and now have to transfer all your knowledge to someone else. It must be like handing over your baby,\u201d said one source in the EMA. Thompson suggested the removal of the MHRA from the approvals system was the EU\u2019s loss. The MHRA did one-third of all the manufacturing inspections and in terms of patient safety they had picked up one third of all \u201cadverse events\u201d. He said: \u201cThis is a pre-eminent regulator. As part of the withdrawal agreement the UK regulator ... they will just be an observer in that system.\u201d McKee said: \u201cThe MHRA has benefited enormously from its close links with the EMA. The fracturing of those links will impact severely. on its budget, much now from the EMA, and its ability to attract and retain skilled staff.\u201d The loss of these valuable specialist contracts underlines the punishing impact Brexit is having on services that supports the pharma industry in Britain. The EMA has already started its move from Britain to its new headquarters in Amsterdam. It employs 900 staff in its Canary Wharf offices, in London, and 84 have already relocated to the Dutch capital, the EMA said. It expected that about 300 of its staff would be unable to relocate and have to find new jobs because of Brexit. The ABPI said the change in approvals meant a huge cost to the medicines companies. Thompson said: \u201cCompanies are having to build extra laboratories to try to prepare to batch-release medicines made in the UK on the continent. That\u2019s a huge cost for us. Hundreds of millions of pounds that we\u2019re having to spend that frankly we\u2019d rather spend on researching new medicines. We have no choice because we have to ensure what we do is legal. It\u2019s probably wasted money in the end. \u201cWe regret that, because the MHRA is a highly respected agency. We\u2019d hope that could be resolved as soon as possible. Ultimately it will be difficult for them to hang on to the capability that they have spent many years building up.\u201d The MHRA said it hoped its relationship with the EMA could be salvaged in negotiations. An MHRA statement said: \u201cWe want to retain a close working partnership with the EU to ensure patients continue to have timely access to safe medicines and medical devices. This involves us making sure our regulators continue to work together, as they do with regulators internationally, and we would like to explore with the EU the terms on which the UK could continue to participate in the EMA.\u201d",

It\u2019s been a British success story.\u201d</p> <p>The EMA said that because of the long lead-time involved in assessing medicines it could no longer award the lead contracts to British people since there was no guarantee they would be part of the EU after March 2019.</p> <p>It is understood the MHRA bid for 36 EMA contracts this year but were only awarded two, and these were for drugs for which evaluation had already begun.</p> <p>The situation is a stark contrast to 2016 when the UK was the lead assessor, known as the rapporteur, on 22 applications, and was joint lead or co-rapporteur on 19 multinational applications. This made it the number one in Europe, with Germany\u2019s regulator behind with 22 lead contracts but only 12 co-contracts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24c98589739a67e57a57d1a61ff64bcdc4e471fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24c98589739a67e57a57d1a61ff64bcdc4e471fb/0_0_932_169/500.png\" alt=\"European Medicines Agency applications for medicines marketing approval.\" width=\"500\" height=\"91\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European Medicines Agency applications for medicines marketing approval.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EMA/European Medicines Agency</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The EMA now also requires all existing drugs assessors to transfer their personal knowledge of their specialist fields to counterparts in a European member state.</p> <p>\u201cYou might have been working on a cancer drug for decades and built up so much expertise and you are the absolute specialist in your field and now have to transfer all your knowledge to someone else. It must be like handing over your baby,\u201d said one source in the EMA.</p> <p>Thompson suggested the removal of the MHRA from the approvals system was the EU\u2019s loss. The MHRA did one-third of all the manufacturing inspections and in terms of patient safety they had picked up one third of all \u201cadverse events\u201d. He said: \u201cThis is a pre-eminent regulator. As part of the withdrawal agreement the UK regulator ... they will just be an observer in that system.\u201d</p> <p>McKee said: \u201cThe MHRA has benefited enormously from its close links with the EMA. The fracturing of those links will impact severely. on its budget, much now from the EMA, and its ability to attract and retain skilled staff.\u201d</p> <p>The loss of these valuable specialist contracts underlines the punishing impact Brexit is having on services that supports the pharma industry in Britain.</p> <p>The EMA has already started its move from Britain to its new headquarters in Amsterdam. It employs 900 staff in its Canary Wharf offices, in London, and 84 have already relocated to the Dutch capital, the EMA said. It expected that about 300 of its staff would be unable to relocate and have to find new jobs because of Brexit.</p> <p>The ABPI said the change in approvals meant a huge cost to the medicines companies.</p> <p>Thompson said: \u201cCompanies are having to build extra laboratories to try to prepare to batch-release medicines made in the UK on the continent. That\u2019s a huge cost for us. Hundreds of millions of pounds that we\u2019re having to spend that frankly we\u2019d rather spend on researching new medicines. We have no choice because we have to ensure what we do is legal. It\u2019s probably wasted money in the end.</p> <p>\u201cWe regret that, because the MHRA is a highly respected agency. We\u2019d hope that could be resolved as soon as possible. Ultimately it will be difficult for them to hang on to the capability that they have spent many years building up.\u201d</p> <p>The MHRA said it hoped its relationship with the EMA could be salvaged in negotiations.</p> <p>An MHRA statement said: \u201cWe want to retain a close working partnership with the EU to ensure patients continue to have timely access to safe medicines and medical devices. This involves us making sure our regulators continue to work together, as they do with regulators internationally, and we would like to explore with the EU the terms on which the UK could continue to participate in the EMA.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "The World Trade Organisation is hurtling towards crisis. Set up more than two decades ago to break down protectionist barriers and to ensure countries play by the rules of international commerce, the WTO is firmly in Donald Trump\u2019s isolationist sights. Up to now, the White House has been waging war by stealth. Trump has garnered the big headlines for his broadsides against China, the European Union, and Canada, while at the same time conducting a quiet war against the WTO. But now the president has aired his discontent publicly, warning that the US will pull out of the WTO unless it treats America better. \u201cIf they don\u2019t shape up, I would withdraw from the WTO,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg. This matters to every one of the WTO\u2019s 164 members, but it matters especially to Britain, which has said it would be prepared to trade with other EU countries on WTO rules if it proves impossible to negotiate a bespoke Brexit deal. In fact, in little more than a year\u2019s time, the WTO could become ineffective, opening the way for a trade free-for-all in which countries can engage in unfair trade without any legal restraints. This comes at a time when relations between Washington and Beijing are worsening. China has, rightly, come to the conclusion that Trump sees trade as a modern way of prosecuting the containment strategy used by the US against the Soviet Union during the cold war. But it is the existential threat to the WTO that poses the real prospect of a full-scale global trade war. The root cause of the problem is something arcane \u2013 the WTO\u2019s system for settling disputes between member states, which up until now has been considered one of the achievements of the last successfully complete global trade negotiations \u2013 the Uruguay Round, signed in 1994. The new procedure \u2013 which was strongly supported by the US during more than seven years of talks \u2013 has two stages. If a country brings a complaint against another member that cannot be resolved by bilateral agreement it is initially dealt with by a disputes panel. The panel makes a ruling, but states can appeal against the decision. The WTO\u2019s appellate body then adjudicates and its decisions are final and binding. Trump has claimed that the US has been badly treated by the appellate body but this is not true. As a nation of lawyers, the US has been good at fighting its corner at the WTO and wins more times than it loses. It is also in the privileged position of knowing that one of the appellate body\u2019s seven members is always an American. The real gripe of Washington is that over the years the appellate body has increasingly been making trade laws rather than enforcing the ones that already exist, thus encroaching on national sovereignty. Interpreting trade rules is a complex and contentious business. The Americans, and some other countries, think member states rather than unelected appeal judges should decide ambiguous or contentious issues and that it is wrong for the appellate body to establish precedents for future cases. Trump\u2019s reluctance to accept that foreign rulings are binding on the US has also been evident in his decision to pull the US out of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and in the negotiations over the future of Nafta, but it is the WTO row that has the most serious implications. Under WTO rules, the appellate body has seven members, each elected for four-year terms, which can be renewed once. When an appeal is lodged, the case must be heard by at least three judges. But as judges have ended their terms, the US has blocked fresh appointments. The list of judges is already down to four and will be down to the minimum of three when the Mauritian member, Shree Baboo Chekitan Servansing, retires at the end of September. Two more members will go by the end of next year, at which point the appeals process will come to a halt. The Petersen Institute, a Washington-based think tank, explained the implications in a recent paper. \u201cShould that happen, the WTO would lose its system of final appellate review, and its panel rulings would seldom become binding. Aggrieved countries would then lose their legal rights under WTO rules. Failure to resolve this crisis thus runs the risk of returning the world trading system to a power-based free-for-all, allowing big players to act unilaterally and use retaliation to get their way.\u201d Trump might think America would do better under the law of the jungle but he is wrong about that. He would pave the way for the global economy\u2019s other big beasts \u2013 China, the EU, and Japan \u2013 to use unfair trade practices against the US without any legal constraint. US unhappiness with the mission creep of the WTO appellate body predates Trump and, as the tacit support for its stance from other member states shows, is not without merit. There are ways out of the current impasse. The Petersen Institute paper says one way forward would be for the the appellate body to submit matters of legal uncertainty to WTO committees for further discussion and negotiation by member states. This, though, presupposes that the US is actually interested in remaining a WTO member and that the other 163 members want the US to stay. At present, many would say good riddance if Trump walked. But the stakes are high. The WTO would stagger on without the US but would become a zombie organisation. It would be rendered as ineffective by the lack of American presence as was another Geneva-based body \u2013 the League of Nations \u2013 between the two world wars.

    "webTitle": "Wonga has gone, but the gig economy that made it necessary is still with us", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The demand for Wonga-like payday lenders is only going to rise and rise. Blame the digital age and its emphasis on speed and flexibility in all things. Wonga, which sank on Thursday under a mountain of compensation claims, is likely to rise from the ashes in a new guise and compete again with the many other financial firms offering instant loans at huge interest rates. The target market \u2013 that of people on low to average incomes who live from one micro-job to the next \u2013 is only going to get bigger. Wonga failed because it was too greedy and at times crossed the ethical line. Under a new management, a firm that plays it straight could still prosper. Wonga started life as an entrepreneurial business built for the age of the smartphone. A clever app that allowed applicants to quickly get small amounts of cash was a godsend to many who feared falling victim to crippling bank charges. The exorbitant interest rates it charged, which reached more than 5,000%, might result in a \u00a320 bill after just a few days. But that was nothing compared to the \u00a330-a-day unauthorised overdraft charges imposed by some high-street lenders. Friendly TV advertising softened the firm\u2019s image and by 2013 it was heading for a \u00a31bn flotation on the stock market. By 2014, things were going wrong. The company was forced to write off \u00a3220m of loans and explain why founder Errol Damelin had quietly sold \u00a317m worth of shares before quitting. Some investors discounted these tribulations as the teething problems faced by countless other firms that make the transition from being young, raw disrupting businesses to more mainstream players. But anti-poverty campaigners were having none of it and MPs such as Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy helped to persuade the financial regulator that a cap on payday loan rates was needed. The Financial Conduct Authority settled on a formula that meant that annual rates could not exceed 1,500%. This broke Wonga\u2019s business model. But even then it might have survived had it not been found issuing fake legal letters to customers in arrears. It was ordered to pay compensation of \u00a32.6m. More importantly for the company\u2019s ailing finances, claims-management companies used this blunder and others to pursue hundreds of complaints and seek compensation. It is this unquantifiable liability that has proved to be the company\u2019s final undoing. This week Wonga\u2019s administrators will begin the process of selling on its \u00a3400m loan book, most probably to a rival. And then the new owners will set about offering loans again to the many and growing number of people living from hand to mouth, for whom it takes only a small jolt to be in financial jeopardy. That could mean not being able to afford the weekly food shop or, worse, the monthly rent. When there are around 2 million people paid the minimum wage, 5.5 million self-employed people and millions of workers who cope on part time wages, it is not difficult to see that low pay is still a feature of British working life. Every year, more jobs that were once full-time and salaried are converted to being part-time and self-employed in the name of flexibility and cost-effective management. Many of the people who seek a payday loan are those who have become part of this \u201cdynamic\u201d economic structure that is, in fact, anything but dynamic. It is a way of conducting business that demoralises workers and in turn depresses productivity. That is not a reason to ban the next Wonga. But it is a reason to keep it tightly regulated \u2013 and then look to the underlying causes that force people to live from hand to mouth. Where now for Google in its third decade? Twenty years into Google\u2019s existence as a company, it faces serious challenges. Assailed by the US president with false claims of bias, fined in Europe for its monopoly tactics, struggling to expand beyond its core business of putting adverts on screens, and attacked by its own staff for considering a move back into China, the road ahead looks steeper than the one behind. Google was incorporated on 4 September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, then Stanford University graduates. Ten years later, the world lay before it. Its Android phone software put Google search front and centre on every Android phone; it is now the default search engine on billions of phones and PCs. YouTube remains the world\u2019s biggest video service. But recently Google has looked less sure-footed. \u201cMoonshot\u201d projects such as internet drones and self-driving cars , as well as contact lenses that monitor diabetes, have been culled, or have struggled. So Google squashes more ads around search results, YouTube videos, and maps: advertising generates 85% of its revenues. That is why China\u2019s billion pairs of eyes is so tempting, despite censorship: it is all upside, advertising-wise. But privacy concerns are mounting, fuelled by the Snowden revelations and the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Europe has the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d. In its home state of California, a grassroots drive led in June to the passage of the US\u2019s strongest data privacy laws, which Google and Facebook also opposed. Its biggest worry, though, should be that both Trump\u2019s Republicans and Democrat opponents opponents think Google is too powerful, and that monopoly law should somehow be invoked to \u201crein it in\u201d. There is a historical echo: Microsoft dominated the 90s, but was never the same after a US antitrust trial that began in 1998, 23 years after its founding. Google is three years younger than Microsoft was then: Page and Brin are not out of the woods yet. Power deal should cause a red alert Shrinking the big six energy firms to five will not harm competition and push up household bills, the competition watchdog declared last week. The Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s verdict marks a 180-degree turn on its opinion of npower and SSE\u2019s merger just four months ago. Back then, the view was that consolidation would substantially cut competition and drive up household bills. So what\u2019s changed? Not a lot, unless you count the large suppliers losing hundreds of thousands more customers to keenly priced rivals. The logical conclusion is that lobbying by advocates of the deal appears to have won the day. A more generous interpretation would be that confidential data shared by the firms backs up the CMA\u2019s finding that few people switch between the pair, and consumers will see little difference. Naturally, SSE and npower pitch the merger as good news for householders, arguing the new company will be more efficient and agile. But while the new firm will be on a par with British Gas for size, it will still be burdened by the high costs that legacy suppliers face. This means it is unlikely to yield a bonanza for householders because those costs will have to be passed on. The reality is the merger is an existential reaction to an energy market that has become a hostile environment for the big six. None seems able to stem its losses to smaller, more competitively priced firms. Npower shed 350,000 customers between July 2017 and July 2018. SSE lost 430,000 between March 2017 and March 2018. And come December, the government\u2019s price cap will cut profit margins on the default tariffs that most of SSE\u2019s customers are on. The big danger is that the new firm reacts by trying to cut its way out by axing jobs, and tarnishes its customer service record. Npower and SSE might have cleared the CMA, but they have bigger challenges to tackle next.",

      "body": "<p>The demand for Wonga-like payday lenders is only going to rise and rise. Blame the digital age and its emphasis on speed and flexibility in all things.</p> <p>Wonga, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/30/wonga-collapses-into-administration\" title=\"\">sank on Thursday</a> under a mountain of compensation claims, is likely to rise from the ashes in a new guise and compete again with the many other financial firms offering instant loans at huge interest rates. The target market \u2013 that of people on low to average incomes who live from one micro-job to the next \u2013 is only going to get bigger. Wonga failed because it was too greedy and at times crossed the ethical line. Under a new management, a firm that plays it straight could still prosper.</p> <p>Wonga started life as an entrepreneurial business built for the age of the smartphone. A clever app that allowed applicants to quickly get small amounts of cash was a godsend to many who feared falling victim to crippling bank charges.</p> <p>The exorbitant interest rates it charged, which reached more than 5,000%, might result in a \u00a320 bill after just a few days. But that was nothing compared to the \u00a330-a-day unauthorised overdraft charges imposed by some high-street lenders. Friendly TV advertising softened the firm\u2019s image and by 2013 it was heading for a \u00a31bn flotation on the stock market.</p> <p>By 2014, things were going wrong. The company was forced to write off \u00a3220m of loans and explain why founder Errol Damelin had quietly sold \u00a317m worth of shares before&#xa0;quitting.</p> <p>Some investors discounted these tribulations as the teething problems faced by countless other firms that make the transition from being young, raw disrupting businesses to more mainstream players.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every year, more jobs that were once full-time and salaried are converted to being part-time and self-employed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But anti-poverty campaigners were having none of it and MPs such as Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy helped to persuade the financial regulator that a cap on payday loan rates was needed. The Financial Conduct Authority settled on a formula that meant that annual rates could not exceed 1,500%.</p> <p>This broke Wonga\u2019s business model. But even then it might have survived had it not been found issuing fake legal letters to customers in arrears. It was ordered to pay compensation of \u00a32.6m. More importantly for the company\u2019s ailing finances, claims-management companies used this blunder and others to pursue hundreds of complaints and seek compensation. It is this unquantifiable liability that has proved to be the company\u2019s final&#xa0;undoing.</p> <p>This week Wonga\u2019s administrators will begin the process of selling on its \u00a3400m loan book, most probably to a rival. And then the new owners will set about offering loans again to the many and growing number of people living from hand to mouth, for whom it takes only a small jolt to be in financial jeopardy. That could mean not being able to afford the weekly food shop or, worse, the monthly rent.</p> <p>When there are around 2 million people paid the minimum wage, 5.5&#xa0;million self-employed people and millions of workers who cope on part time wages, it is not difficult to see that low pay is still a feature of British working life.</p> <p>Every year, more jobs that were once full-time and salaried are converted to being part-time and self-employed in the name of flexibility and cost-effective management.</p> <p>Many of the people who seek a payday loan are those who have become part of this \u201cdynamic\u201d economic structure that is, in fact, anything but dynamic. It is a way of conducting business that demoralises workers and in turn depresses&#xa0;productivity.</p> <p>That is not a reason to ban the next Wonga. But it is a reason to keep it tightly regulated \u2013 and then look to the underlying causes that force people to live from hand to&#xa0;mouth.</p> <h2>Where now for Google in its third decade?<br></h2> <p>Twenty years into Google\u2019s existence as a company, it faces serious challenges. Assailed by the US president with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/28/trump-twitter-google-not-partisan-bias\" title=\"\"> false claims of bias</a>, fined in Europe for its monopoly tactics, struggling to expand beyond its core business of putting adverts on screens, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/17/google-staff-protest-against-plan-for-censored-chinese-search-engine\" title=\"\">attacked by its own staff</a> for considering a move back into China, the road ahead looks steeper than the one behind.</p> <p>Google was incorporated on 4 September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, then Stanford University graduates. Ten years later, the world lay before it. Its Android phone software put Google search front and centre on every Android phone; it is now the default search engine on billions of phones and PCs. YouTube remains the world\u2019s biggest video service.</p> <p>But recently Google has looked less sure-footed. \u201cMoonshot\u201d projects such as internet drones and self-driving cars , as well as contact lenses that monitor diabetes, have been culled, or have struggled. So Google squashes more ads around search results, YouTube videos, and maps: advertising generates 85% of its revenues. That is why China\u2019s billion pairs of eyes is so tempting, despite censorship: it is all upside, advertising-wise.</p> <p>But privacy concerns are mounting, fuelled by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/18/google-not-gchq--truly-chilling-spy-network\" title=\"\">Snowden revelations </a>and the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Europe has the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d. In its home state of California, a grassroots drive led in June to the passage of the US\u2019s strongest data privacy laws, which Google and Facebook also opposed.</p> <p>Its biggest worry, though, should be that both Trump\u2019s Republicans and Democrat opponents opponents think Google is too powerful, and that monopoly law should somehow be invoked to \u201crein it in\u201d. There is a historical echo: Microsoft dominated the 90s, but was never the same after a US antitrust trial that began in 1998, 23&#xa0;years after its founding. Google is three years younger than Microsoft was then: Page and Brin are not out of the woods yet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd979f9fd29cccc146cf6ce58cecbc0b7bc5f99b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd979f9fd29cccc146cf6ce58cecbc0b7bc5f99b/0_50_1992_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google\u2019s co-founders, Larry Page, left, and Sergey Brin in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google\u2019s co-founders, Larry Page, left, and Sergey Brin in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Randi Lynn Beach/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Power deal should cause a red alert</h2> <p>Shrinking the big six energy firms to five will not harm competition and push up household bills, the competition watchdog declared&#xa0;last&#xa0;week.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/30/npower-sse-merger-wins-go-ahead-from-competition-watchdog\" title=\"\">Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s verdict</a> marks a 180-degree turn on its opinion of npower and SSE\u2019s merger just four months ago.

Not a lot, unless you count the large suppliers losing hundreds of thousands more customers to keenly priced rivals.</p> <p>The logical conclusion is that lobbying by advocates of the deal appears to have won the day. A more generous interpretation would be that confidential data shared by the firms backs up the CMA\u2019s finding that few people switch between the pair, and consumers will see little&#xa0;difference.</p> <p>Naturally, SSE and npower pitch the merger as good news for householders, arguing the new company will be more efficient and agile.</p> <p>But while the new firm will be on a par with British Gas for size, it will still be burdened by the high costs that legacy suppliers face.
