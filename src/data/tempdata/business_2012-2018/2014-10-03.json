    "webTitle": "RBS wants more women in senior roles", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is considering introducing targets for the number of senior female employees in an attempt to address the gender imbalance at the group. Alison Rose, head of commercial and private banking at RBS, said she supported the idea of \u201caspirational targets\u201d for the bank. More than half of its staff are women, at 53% of the total. In clerical jobs, the percentage is 67%, but the proportion of executive roles held by women at RBS is 20% and none of these women sits on the main board. Rose is one of two women on the 11-strong executive committee, one rung below board level. Previously in a senior role in RBS\u2019s investment bank, Rose said the financial services industry was notorious for having a lack of women in senior roles. \u201cAs a business head it is a business imperative. If I\u2019m not recruiting, retaining or developing the most talented workforce I possibly can, I\u2019m not going to be delivering the best results \u2026 it is ridiculous we don\u2019t have more talented women coming through the organisation into the financial services sector,\u201d said Rose. In her new division \u2013 which employs 9,500 and generates about a third of RBS\u2019s operating profit \u2013 a quarter of its relationship managers, who deal directly with customers, are female. Asked if RBS was considering targets for hiring women, she said: \u201cWe are.\u201d She added: \u201cWhat I\u2019m focusing on is a long-term programme that gets more women up to the board level.\u201d This year Lloyds Banking Group set a goal for 40% of the top 5,000 roles to be held by women by 2020, up from 28% now. The lack of women in senior executive roles at British companies has been under scrutiny since 2011 when Mervyn Davies, in a government-commissioned report, set a goal for FTSE 100 companies to double the number of women in boardrooms to 25% by 2015. While women now account for more than 20% of boardroom roles, the majority of these are non-executives, with only 7% of executive roles held by women. At RBS, three of the eleven boardroom directors are female non-executives. The gender balance in FTSE 100 boardrooms will be updated next week when a half-yearly report is delivered to the business secretary, Vince Cable, who has been a champion of increasing the number of women in boardrooms. Promoted to head one of the three new divisions set up by RBS boss Ross McEwan in February, Rose presented her strategy for the division earlier this week. Rose said she intended to \u201crefresh, retrain and repopulate\u201d the workforce in a unit that provides banking services to companies big enough to be in the FTSE 250 index and individuals wealthy enough to be banked by Coutts, the private banking arm of RBS. Rose pointed to a need to train staff by bringing in professional accreditation, which covers a range of issues including ethics. The division has seen a 50% cut in management jobs and 120 products removed from sale in recent months. Rose\u2019s research shows the NatWest brand performing better than its parent company, RBS. There is, she said, a \u201cbrand drag that comes from RBS\u201d. She said the answer was not to ditch the RBS brand and replace it with NatWest but deal with the issues, such as negative publicity about its treatment of small business customers in its soon to be disbanded global restructuring group. To counter criticism from politicians that the bank is withdrawing loans from businesses, RBS has written to 300,000 small business customers offering \u00a312bn of new lending. Some \u00a31.3bn has been taken up and customers have said they might use another \u00a32.6bn.",

Florence Newell, a councillor in the town, says: \u201cTwo or three years ago, the council approached Morrisons but they said they would not get enough custom and turned us down flat.\u201d She says millions of pounds were ploughed into the Tesco project, including diverting the course of a river that snakes behind the store, and says there has been disruption to the busy A141 at its front. \u201cEven the people who didn\u2019t want a Tesco are very angry.\u201d Grocery Insight analyst Steve Dresser says Tesco will have to start paying rent when the developers hand over the keys to Chatteris next month, but, by mothballing, will avoid the big, fixed running costs of heating, lighting, refrigeration and staff. \u201cOnce you start opening stores, then costs accumulate,\u201d says Dresser. While Tesco\u2019s shares maybe unpopular in the City, the bigger problem for Lewis is regaining popularity among shoppers. They are turning their back on the major supermarkets and heading for the discounters, such as Aldi and Lidl, for their no-nonsense low prices. In the car park of the busy Aldi store in Ely, Jaguar S-types and Skodas nestle side by side, pointing to a broad demographic of shoppers who no longer fear the social stigma of being spotted in a no-frills discount shop, lured by the promise that their basket of shopping will be 15% cheaper than at the major chains. \u201cI used to be a Tesco shopper\u201d, says Kylie Bullman, with her toddler son in tow. \u201cI shop at Aldi now because it works out a lot cheaper.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "After the recent slump in share prices - the FTSE 100 for example was at a near 10 month low on Thursday - investors were cautiously tipping their toes back in the water. The worries which have hit markets hard - signs of economic weakness around the world, a disappointing update from the ECB, protests in Hong Kong, air strikes on Isis, trouble in Ukraine and concerns about the spread of ebola - have not gone away. But many investors clearly felt the falls had gone too far. The more positive mood was helped by the US revealing a better than expected non-farm payroll figure, with 248,000 jobs added in September compared to expectations of 215,000. July and August figures were also revised upwards. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 81.52 points or 1.26% higher at 6527.91 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.92% to 4281.74 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 1.54% to 20,200.62 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.44% at 10,567.6 Germany\u2019s Dax was closed for unity day In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 168 points or 1% higher. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, have a good weekend, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. George Osborne has caused a stir by telling businessmen at the Institute of Directors\u2019 conference to counter what he sees as an anti-free market movement led by trade unions and charities. Katie Allen reports: Speaking to business leaders at the Institute of Directors\u2019 annual convention, Osborne said principles of enterprise and business as a force for widespread prosperity were \u201cup for grabs\u201d for the first time in his adult life. Osborne told the audience at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall: \u201cYou have to get out there and put the business argument. Because there are plenty of pressure groups, plenty of trade unions and plenty of charities and the like, that will put the counter view. Katie\u2019s full story is here. And she has asked the TUC to comment on Osborne\u2019s remarks: TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u201cThe Chancellor accuses unions of being anti-business, yet many of Britain\u2019s most successful companies and sectors \u2013 such as car-makers \u2013 depend on the labour and skills of trade unionists just as much as their managers. He has let down his guard to show how much he agrees with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s \u2018enemy within\u2019 rhetoric. \u201cBut the real issue today is that the Chancellor is doing nothing to fairly share the benefits of recovery. He has rewarded soaraway executive pay with tax cuts for the super-rich, but been happy to see the longest and deepest cut in living standards for everyone else, only this week announcing cuts in the benefits that low paid workers desperately need when the real value of their pay is falling.\u201d And some comments from delegates at the IoD on Andy Street\u2019s comments about France, courtesy of Katie Allen: John Rider, a turnaround expert from the West Midlands, who knows Street from local business alliances, felt the comments on France were out of character. \u201cI have got a lot of time for Andy but I am surprised at his comments on France,\u201d said Rider, a former regional chairman for the IoD in the West Midlands. \u201cBut I understand. It is difficult to do business [in France] and some of the protection of people is rigid and stops you making any change.\u201d \u201cIf you employ people in France you are trapped for donkey\u2019s years by red tape, bureaucracy, people and they seem pretty comfortable about it.\u201d Another delegate, who happens to be French, thinks Street has overlooked the might of some important French sectors, not least luxury goods. \u201cL\u2019Oreal is still number one in the world. John Lewis actually sells a lot of French products,\u201d says Veronique Raynaud, who has lived in London for 16 years. \u201cJohn Lewis is probably doing very well from all the French community living near Sloane Square and buying French products.\u201d \u201cYou can make comments on policies of government, on taxes, but can you make a comment on not investing in a country? It\u2019s a bit of a blanket comment to make. It\u2019s not very informed.\u201d Others were sympathetic to Street\u2019s follow up claim that his comments on France were \u201ctongue in cheek\u201d. \u201cWe have all made mistakes and he\u2019s not an expert on the French economy. He may have had a lapse of the tongue,\u201d said one conference delegate, who \u2013 perhaps taking a PR lesson from Street\u2019s faux-pas \u2013 declined to be named. Meanwhile the founder of Uber has provided the Institute of Directors with a different take on what people like Andy Street see as France\u2019s shortcomings, writes Katie Allen: Travis Kalanick, chief executive of the taxi app company, tells the conference Uber was born in Paris. \u201cI like to say we were founded in Paris,\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t go near what may or may not have been tongue in cheek comments from John Lewis boss Street, but Kalanick recounts being in the French capital with his co-founder. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get a taxi... I don\u2019t know if you have ever tried to get a taxi in Paris... my co-founder said I wish I could push a button and get a ride.\u201d Some say sclerotic. Some say the mother of invention... Back with the comments on France from John Lewis managing director Andy Street. As a reminder he said, among other things, that France was \u201csclerotic, hopeless and downbeat\u201d and said the Gare du Nord was \u201cthe squalor pit of Europe\u201d. My colleague Katie Allen is at the Institute of Directors\u2019 annual meeting and has been talking to its director general Simon Walker. She reports: Walker told the Guardian that Street\u2019s remarks had taken him aback a little but he sympathised with concerns about the French economy: \u201cI\u2019m a little surprised. I have a house in France and spend as much time as I can in France\u2026 the wine is better, the people are stylish\u2026 I even quite like Gard du Nord. \u201cThe French economy is a disaster area and I think his analysis is basically right. \u201cI have certainly worked in companies that wouldn\u2019t invest in France because of its rigid and inflexible labour market\u2026 France is protectionist and protectionism is something that has to be fought.\u201d But he said it was wrong to think of France as devoid of economic dynamism. \u201cThere are many entrepreneurs in France.\u201d As for how France compares to its neighbours, Walker added: \u201cSclerotic is a legitimate word to use with regard to France and other parts of the eurozone as well.\u201d Aside from freeing up labour in France, the country should also reduce its government spending as a share of GDP, currently an \u201cunsustainable\u201d 58%, Walker said. He would not take Street\u2019s lead in recommending people take investments out of France, Walker said. \u201cI think you invest where you can find open markets and that\u2019s always a bit of a myth with France, because this is the country that blocked the takeover of a yoghurt company,\u201d Walker said, referring to the government\u2019s blocking of a buyout of Danone in 2005. But he would not tell IoD members where to do business. \u201cI think we should trade wherever we can. We have people who export to North Korea. Don\u2019t give up hope on anywhere,\u201d Walker concluded. Jean Claude Juncker, the EU\u2019s president designate has held lunchtime talks with Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras during his flying visit to Athens. The meeting - at the Benaki Museum in Athens - took place in \u201ca very good climate\u201d according to local media. Helena Smith reports: The visit was aimed at concentrating minds on reform efforts Greece has to make as mission chiefs representing the country\u2019s troika of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF, conduct a fifth review of the Greek economy with government ministers in Athens. Greek media reports said that the incoming president was also keen to discuss \u201cthe post-bailout [memorandum] Greece\u201d as the country prepares to exit its \u20ac240bn international financial support programme. Over the working lunch with Samaras, Juncker focused specifically on Greece\u2019s desire to disengage from the Washington-based IMF, whose disbursement of aid instalments was originally not due to end until March 2016 (unlike euro area countries whose support for the debt-stricken nation expires this year). In a move that took many aback, Samaras announced the end of the \u201cmemorandum period\u201d for Greece during talks with the German chancellor Angela Merkel last week, saying that Athens would seek to end engagement with the IMF \u201cearly.\u201d The leader, who earlier this week announced he would seek a vote of confidence in his government next week, has said that it is now vital that Greece ends oversight by foreign lenders and takes ownership of its own reform/modernisation programme almost five years after seeking international aid to avoid bankruptcy. Juncker, readers of this blog will recall, is a hardened \u201chellenophile\u201d and one of the strongest supporters of Greece throughout the eurozone crisis when as euro group chairman he was in charge of much EU policy towards the country. If the US non-farm payroll numbers are better than expected, then the just-released service sector for September has shown a dip from August. The services sector purchasing managers index fell to 58.9 from 59.5, but up from an earlier flash reading for September of 58.5. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: A slowing in the pace of service sector growth in September matched a similar easing in the pace of manufacturing output growth seen during the month, suggesting the overall pace of economic expansion dipped to the weakest since May. But this has not stopped the US market - and indeed European ones - from rebounding from recent weakness. In early trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 143 points or 0.85%. A US interest rate rise in the second quarter is looking increasingly unlikely, according to Rob Carnell of ING. He said: There were some elements in this release for the doves to cling on to. Wages growth, despite anecdotes of strong hiring, labour shortages and building wage pressure, slipped back to 2.0% year on year from 2.1%, on a 0.0% month on month change. This is disappointing. That said, with oil prices plunging, and headline inflation in the US likely to fall sharply in coming months, thoughts of a second quarter 2015 rate hike from the Fed are looking increasingly unlikely, so wages are less of a pivot for policy-makers than they were several months ago when CPI inflation was pushing above 2.0%. Alastair Winter, chief economist at Daniel Stewart (the boutique investment bank), says Fed chief Janet Yellen will worry that wages aren\u2019t rising faster, and the other downbeat elements to the report. But that may not stop rates rising in the first half of next year. Alistair writes: \u201cWelcome as the drop in the unemployment rate is, I very much doubt it will make much difference to the FOMC in its march towards the first rate hike in March or June 2015. The kindly Ms Yellen will wring her hands over the stubbornly high numbers of long-term unemployed, the part-timers wanting to be full-time and the \u2018discouraged workers.\u2019 The realistic Ms Yellen will fret more over the slow growth of average earnings and the sticky participation rate. Then she will conclude there is not much more she can do about any of them.\u201d Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services, says the drop in the US jobless rate is a relief after various weaker data recently. Here\u2019s his take on the non-farm report: Key points: a) Payrolls: a solid beat at +248k vs. expected 215K, with August revised up by 38K, and July up by 31K Positives: 1) Government jobs increase +12K Disappointments: 1) gain paced by Services +207K, notably Retail +35K 2) Leisure/Hospitality +33K, so a continued lack of breadth: 3) Manufacturing just +4K with August revised down to -4K b) Unemployment Rate: down to 5.9% from 6.1% will be grist to the mill for the Fed hawks, but the doves will note that the Underemployment Rate at 11.8% while falling from 12.0% is still far too high, especially at this stage of the cycle, though +232K rise in Employment encouraging,though offset by fresh low on the Participation Rate at 62.7% from 62.8% c) Average Hourly Earnings: soft at Flat m/m 2.0% y/y - though given that the Payrolls gains were paced by lower paid services jobs, this should not come any surprise. d) Average Weekly Hours: Hoorah the headline reading at 34.6 has finally broken the 34.5 ceiling that has been in place since 2012, though Manufacturing Hours only marginally higher - again unsurprising given Manufacturing payrolls. With America\u2019s jobless rate now the lowest since summer 2008, there is more pressure on the Fed to normalise monetary policy. So reckons Marcus Bullus, trading director of MB Capital: \u201cAfter this robust number, and decent upward revisions for both July and August, the hawks will once again be circling. \u201cPolicymakers will also be encouraged by the fall in the number of discouraged workers. More people are starting to believe in the economy again and that matters a lot. However, there\u2019s no avoiding the fact that wages aren\u2019t rising faster: \u201cAnaemic wage growth continues to be the major conundrum facing markets and policymakers alike. \u201cYou\u2019d expect to see wages rising with more gusto in an improving jobs market, but this just isn\u2019t happening. These two tweets sum up the non-farm payroll: As the dollar strengthens, the gold price takes another tumble: The dollar is surging, as traders calculate that the fall in the US unemployment rate will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates before too long. It has gained over a cent against the pound, to $1.6006. The initial reaction in the financial markets is that this is a strong jobs report. The other disappointment is that America\u2019s labor force participation rate has fallen again, from 62.8% to 62.7%. That shows that more people have dropped out of the workforce altogether, which helped to drag the overall jobless rate down to 5.9% [because it measures the proportion of people who could be in work, but aren\u2019t] But there is disappointment too - today\u2019s non-farm payroll shows no change in average hourly earnings in September compared with August. That suggests that the recovery isn\u2019t really feeding into American\u2019s wage packets. Wall Street economists had been hoping for a 0.2% increase month-on-month. That left wages 2.0% higher than a year ago. More good news, last month\u2019s weak non-farm payroll report has been revised higher. It now shows that 180,000 new jobs were created in August, not the 142,000 first estimated. And July\u2019s NFP is higher too - up to 243k, from 212k before. BREAKING: The US non-farm payroll shows that 248,000 new jobs were created across America last month. That\u2019s a stronger reading than expected. And the US unemployment rate has fallen to 5.9%, which is the lowest since July 2008. But it\u2019s not all good news --- the labour force participation rate is a little lower, and average earnings are unchanged. Lots more details to follow.... Right, time for the last major piece of economic news of the week (hurrah!) The US non-farm payroll is announced in a few moments, showing how many new jobs were created in America last month. And economists expect a reading of at least 200,000.... Andy Street\u2019s comments about the French economy have already caused a stink in Paris, where a deputy mayor called them \u201cfalse and idiotic\u201d. Our correspondent Kim Willsher reports: Jean-Louis Missika, a deputy Paris mayor in charge of economic development and the attractiveness of Paris to investors, told The Guardian that if Andy Street was joking, perhaps Paris should respond in kind. \u201cWhat he says is false and idiotic. As we say, everything excessive is exaggerated, but then it seems French bashing is all the fashion chez vous. \u201cFactually it\u2019s false because figures show that last year Paris attracted more foreign investment than London, and because Paris is a dynamic city with a quality of service that is often better than in London.\u201d John Lewis\u2019s managing director, Andy Street, has apologised unreservedly for his comments about France. In a statement, Street said: \u201cThe remarks I made were supposed to be lighthearted views, and tongue in cheek. On reflection I clearly went too far. I regret the comments, and apologise unreservedly\u201d. As covered earlier (and all over the UK press), Street describing France as \u201csclerotic, hopeless and downbeat\u201d. He made the comments at an event in London, following a trip to Paris where he received a retail award that was \u201cmade of plastic and is frankly revolting\u201d. ITV\u2019s Joel Hills is reporting that John Lewis\u2019s MD has now apologised for his French gaffe: The bold declaration by John Lewis\u2019s MD that France was in decline and \u201cfinished\u201d continues to reverberate around the media today. Over on FT Alphaville, Bryce Elder was tickled by Andy Street\u2019s description of Gare du Nord as a \u201csqualid\u201d railway station. Such a contrast with Britain\u2019s own architectural heritage, eh?: When not doing his bit for Entente cordiale, Bryce also got the City excited by discussing rumours that Tesco might need to raise \u00a33bn from its own shareholders. We can say with a degree of certainty that a rights issue, \u00a33bn ish probably, is among the options being considered. That sent Tesco\u2019s shares down another 4.5%; a spokesperson has now said there are \u201cno current plans\u201d for a rights issue. No mention of future plans, of course.... The Institute of Directors had hoping to hear from Alex Salmond at today\u2019s annual conference. But after the Scottish first minister pulled out, organisers called in Peter Kellner, president of pollsters YouGov, to cover all things Scottish referendum. And he spoke about how public trust in those in power, including business people, has been eroded. From the Hall, Katie Allen reports: Kellner talked about the vote on Scottish independence but also had a message for the audience of business leaders. Providing some welcome context for George Osborne\u2019s earlier complaints about the rise of an anti-business movement, Kellner flagged up the dwindling reputations of those in power - be it in central government, local government or business. There had been a marked decline in recent years of trust in politics, driven by the weapons of mass destruction (WMD) revelations (or lack thereof) and later on the expenses scandal. But YouGov had also noted that the reputation of business leaders had declined as a group by tracking various figures in positions of power, Kellner said. He told the audience that people picked politicians largely based questions around apparent characteristics such as \u201care they self-serving or public spirited?\u201d Similarly, businesses must ask themselves how their behaviour plays out in public. If they are judged by stories of \u201czero-hours, bad pay for cleaners, bad treatment of people in China and Bangladesh... bonuses that appear unforgiveable, tax arrangements that are not ... sociable ... these play like the WMD story on reputations,\u201d Kellner warned. George Osborne\u2019s broad message to the Institute of Directors this morning is that stability and tax cuts go hand in hand. He was speaking just two days after PM David Cameron promised billions of pounds of income tax cuts if the Conservatives win the next election. But that\u2019s not guaranteed. Political expert Peter Kellner told IoD members that next May\u2019s poll could deliver another coalition. Asked about the UK government\u2019s push for reforms in the European Union, Osborne sought to emphasise it was not an entirely selfless project. The chancellor declared: \u201cWe want economic reform in Europe not just for ourselves but for the French, the Spanish [and other countries too]. \u201cWe do it not just for ourselves but because we want to live in a prosperous economy,\u201d he said. On the subject of immigration, increasingly linked in British political debate to the European Union, Osborne appeared to sympathise with some voters\u2019 concerns. \u201cFree movement of people was never envisaged as freedom to move and claim benefits.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important that we find a way through this... there are very real concerns of many members of the British public.\u201d The IoD, though, is concerned that the clampdown on free movement could hurt the economy, as their head of Europe and trade policy Allie Renison flags up: Osborne ended with a plea to business to take a stand in what he sees as a new wrangle over the role of enterprise in society. \u201cThat issue felt like it had been resolved when the Berlin wall fell,\u201d he says. \u201cI would urge the business community not to stand on the sidelines.\u201d And \u2013 preaching to the choir somewhat \u2013 he told the audience to put the \u201cbusiness argument\u201d against the trade unions, charities and others who - Osborne believed - question the role of business. Osborne\u2019s own vision is of a business-friendly \u201clow tax economy that delivers prosperity for people for generations to come.\u201d There endeth the lesson from the Book of Capitalists..... Asked by an IoD member from the West Midlands about why the UK still struggled to grow exports, George Osborne said problems in the eurozone, a key market, were a short-term challenge and longer term small and medium sized businesses needed to look further afield. \u201cVery, very weak growth in the eurozone\u201d is the \u201cbiggest near-term risk\u201d, he told the Annual Conference. Long-term, \u201cwe have not connected ourselves enough with the fast growing economies in Asia and the like.\u201d He said small and medium sized business in the UK appeared \u201ctoo daunted\u201d about launching into new markets, not the case for small and medium sized businesses in Germany. For its part, the government has expanded UKTI, he said, and was taking cues from business rather than seeking to come up with export policies out of Whitehall. \u201cBut I am the first to say we have more work to do in this space.\u201d George Osborne also promised that Westminster will meet its pledge to Scotland\u2019s oil and gas industry.... ...even if he\u2019s a bit vague on the details. The eurozone remains the biggest threat to the UK recovery, Osborne says (perhaps he was thinking of this morning\u2019s poor PMI surveys...) George Osborne is explaining to the IoD annual conferenve how the raft of measures announced this week add up (Katie Allen writes) The chancellor lays out three points he sees as key to the party\u2019s policies. Firstly, stability and reassurance that the deficit will come down is crucial, especially for businesses. \u201cWe have got to reduce the deficit which is still too high\u201d and so he has announced things you would not normally hear ahead of an election, he says, such as a benefits freeze. Secondly, the Conservatives \u201cunashamedly put business at the heart of our political message.\u201d Hence competitive business tax rates, he says. Thirdly, \u201cwe have got to make work pay ... That the system works for hard working people, making sure people pay less tax, people on low pay are taken out of tax\u201d and that there is help for people on middle incomes too. Overall, he says, the government has showed: \u201cwe can achieve both those things, economic stability and low taxes.\u201d Simon Walker, IoD director-general, is introducing George Osborne at the Institute of Directors annual conference now. Walker says the theme of this year\u2019s business jamboree is \u201cgame changer\u201d (reports my colleague Katie Allen from the conference). Walker says much has changed since last year\u2019s meeting, including the creation of half a million jobs and stronger growth than most other advanced economies. But it is also a year when the country almost broke apart. Part of the reason for that is some people are feeling the effects of the recession rather than the recovery from recession, he says. Walker also urges members to make sure that business gets across the message that is a force for good.... Heads-up... UK chancellor George Osborne has begun speaking at the Institute of Director\u2019s Annual Convention..... John Lewis, the retail chain, is in the spotlight this morning after its managing director described France as \u201csclerotic, hopeless and downbeat\u201d. Andy Street urged British entrepreneurs to flee the country while there\u2019s time, declaring: If you\u2019ve got investments in French businesses, get them out quickly.\u201d Street also blasted the Gare du Nord as the \u201csqualor pit of Europe\u201d (?!), in remarks which The Times reckons were \u2018tongue in cheek\u2019. \u2018Head in hands\u2019 might be more appropriate. More here: John Lewis boss: \u2018France is sclerotic, hopeless and downbeat \u2026 it\u2019s finished\u2019 The UK services PMI report suggests that Britain\u2019s economy grew by around 0.8% in the third quarter of this year, according to Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson. He reckons the economy is \u2018moderating\u2019, after several strong quarters: \u201cSeptember\u2019s PMI surveys suggest that the UK most likely enjoyed another spell of above-trend economic growth in the third quarter, but the recovery appears to be losing its legs. \u201cThe PMI surveys are collectively signalling GDP growth of 0.8% in the third quarter, down from 0.9% in the three months to June but still strong by historical standards. However, the pace of expansion hit a six-month low in September and is showing signs of moderating further as we move towards the end of the year.\u201d Here comes the UK data....and the news is that Britain\u2019s dominant service sector recorded decent growth in September. But growth did slow a little, to its slowest in three months, and there are fears that the recent strong recovery is \u201closing its legs\u201d. The UK services PMI dipped to a three month low last month, dropping to 58.7 from 60.5 in August. (50 is the cut-off point between expansion and contraction) Markit says that overall growth remains \u201csharp\u201d, and the good news is that new business continued to increase. It adds: Capacity remained under pressure, with backlogs of work continuing to increase, and companies were suitably encouraged to add to their payroll numbers. Confidence in the future also helped to support payroll expansion, with latest data showing business expectations at a three-month high. September\u2019s poor PMI surveys show that eurozone economic growth in the last quarter was weak, says Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit: \u201cThe PMI suggests the eurozone economy remained stuck in a rut in the third quarter. After GDP stagnated in the second quarter, we can only expect modest growth of 0.2-0.3% in the third quarter based on these survey readings, with momentum being lost as we head into the final quarter of the year. There are some pockets of growth: Ireland\u2019s economy is recovering strongly, Spain is seeing a still-robust upturn and the German service sector is providing an important prop to growth in the region as a whole. But the overall picture is one of a euro area economy that is struggling against multiple headwinds. These include a lack of domestic demand in many countries, subdued bank lending, sanctions with Russia and a reluctance of companies to expand in the face of an uncertain economic outlook. And if things don\u2019t improve, there will be more pressure on the European Central Bank to \u201cbroaden the scope of its planned asset purchases\u201d to buy riskier assets and even sovereign debt, Williamson concludes. Here\u2019s a reminder of this morning\u2019s data: Europe\u2019s economic woes have deepened, with private sector growth slowing to the lowest rate in 10 months. That\u2019s the conclusions of this morning\u2019s data, and surveys earlier this week. Markit\u2019s Eurozone PMI composite output index, which tracks activity across thousands of firms, has fallen to a ten-month low of 52.0 in September, down from 52.5 in August. Markit pulls no punches, saying: The ongoing malaise in the eurozone economy continued at the end of the third quarter, with the latest PMI data showing a further waning of output and new order growth. As covered earlier in the blog, Italy (details) and France (details) are the two main worries. France saw solid declines in both manufacturing production and service sector activity. The contraction in Italy was centred on the service sector, as manufacturing output expanded. The data is also a blow to hopes that Europe\u2019s employment crisis might be improving. Staffing levels fell at the steepest pace for 16 months in France. Job creation accelerated in Germany, but slowed in Ireland and Spain. Headcounts stabilised in Italy, following a slight decrease in August. Reaction to follow.... Germany\u2019s service firms have defied the slowdown in France, Italy and Spain, with activity growing at a faster rate. The German services PMI rose to 55.7 in September, up from 54.9 in August, showing growth accelerated. Activity and new order growth picked up after dipping in August. But it\u2019s not all good news. Confidence towards the business outlook among German firms falls to 15-month low. Markit\u2019s Oliver Kolodseike says:\uf0a7 companies expect the introduction of a national minimum wage in January 2015 to have at least some negative effect on economic growth. Russian sanctions and the weak eurozone economy may be a factor. France\u2019s economy has moved deeper into trouble too. Its service sector contracted in September for the first time in three months, according to Markit, dragging the wider French private sector into contraction too. Service sector firms reported a fall in new business, and an increase in staff layoffs. Alarmingly, French service sector firms cut staffing levels at the sharpest rate in 17 months. Markit says: There were reports from the survey panel linking job losses to company restructuring policies and, in some cases, decisions not to replace voluntary leavers. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, adds: \u201cSeptember\u2019s PMI data rounded off another disappointing quarter for the French private sector economy. Based on the survey\u2019s activity readings, GDP still looks to be tracking close to stagnation, continuing the stalling performance seen since the start of the year. Jobs across the private sector were cut at the sharpest rate for 16 months in September, suggesting that companies are braced for a prolonged period of weakness.\u201d And this is worrying too! Italy\u2019s service sector suffered a deeper contraction than expected last month. Markit\u2019s Italian services sector PMI fell to 48.8, down from August\u2019s reading of 49.8. That shows a sharper drop in activity, indicating that Italy\u2019s service sector remained in contraction at the end of the third quarter, Markit reports that new business fell, due to \u201ca general weakening of client demand in September\u201d. Phil Smith, economist at Markit, says the reading puts \u201canother dent in the hopes of the [Italian] economy climbing out of recession in the third quarter\u201d. \u201cWeakness in demand was evident as new business intakes went down another notch, which in turn pressured businesses into making further notable reductions to their charges. Manufacturers likewise reduced their output prices, suggesting broad-based deflationary forces. \u201cA halt in service sector job cuts and improved business sentiment were the relatively positive takeaways from the latest data, with the former a step in the right direction in terms of seeing demand-side trends improve.\u201d Now this is worrying... growth in the Spanish service sector has slowed, and new orders grew at the lowest rate in almost a year. Spain\u2019s recent revival tailed off last month, according to data firm Markit, with employment levels broadly unchanged. Its Spanish services PMI fell sharply to 55.8 in September from 58.1 in August; that still shows growth, but not as robust. It\u2019s the slowest rise in activity for three months. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit, doesn\u2019t sound too alarmed, predicting that Spain\u2019s economy still grew solidly in the last quarter. But still.... \u201cThere were signs of a growth slowdown in the Spanish service sector at the end of Q3, particularly with regards to new business which increased at the weakest pace for almost a year. There was also disappointing news on the employment front, with the recent spell of job creation coming to an end. Russia\u2019s private sector only managed to post small growth last month, according to HSBC\u2019s survey of the sector. The Russian composite PMI slid to just 50.9, close to the 50-point mark showing stagnation. Firms reported falling optimism, with business expectations close to their lowest point since the financial crisis began. Employment levels fell for the 15th month running, and firms reported \u201cweakening demand, a lack of funds among clients and weak international demand\u201d. Alexander Morozov, HSBC\u2019s chief economist for Russia, warned that the country is sliding into recession: Overall, the Russian economy must have continued very slow growth in September amid strong and intensified cost pressures and increasing uncertainties about future business development. Such weak mechanical growth is better than the absence of growth, but we do not see drivers for stronger growth while downside risks to growth are abundant. Lower oil prices and persistent decline in fixed investment are just few of them. A mild recession remains our base case scenario for the coming quarters. Here\u2019s the full report. Ireland\u2019s recovery from the depths of its austerity slump continues, with service sector firms reporting the 26th month of consecutive growth. Investec\u2019s monthly PMI survey, based on interviews with purchasing managers at Irish firms, found that new business had expanded at its fastest since May 2006. Irish firms are also more confidence, with 60% expecting activity to rise in the next year. Philip O\u2019Sullivan, Chief Economist at Investec Ireland, says Ireland is benefiting from the recovery in the UK economy: Panellists reported that the growth in New Business was a result of clients\u2019 increased willingness to commit to new projects given signs of improvement in the Irish economy. Growth in New Export Business also accelerated during September, with the UK cited as a particular source of strength. The overall Service sector PMI rose to 62.5 in September, showing strong growth, after August\u2019s 62.4. There\u2019s gloomy news from China overnight -- its services sector has grown at the slowest pace in eight month, partly due to the weakening housing market. Official figures showed that new orders actually shrank in September, for the first time since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) fell to 54.0 in September from 54.4 in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. That still shows growth, but the slowest since January, adding to concerns that the Chinese economy is slowing. Today\u2019s report also shows that China\u2019s real estate sector shrank in September, as did the aviation and logistics sectors. Cai Jin, the vice-chairman of China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, reckons China\u2019s property slide may have bottomed out: Business activities in the property market have stabilized at low levels but stayed within the contractionary area, suggesting overall activities remained sluggish.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. After yesterday\u2019s nervy sell-off, Europe\u2019s stock markets are expected to bounce back a little today as traders prepare for the latest US jobs report. September\u2019s non-farm payroll, due at 1.30pm BST, is expected to show that hiring picked up again after just 142,000 or so new jobs were created in August. And a positive jobs report is likely to drive investors to conclude that the US Federal Reserve will move closer to its first interest rate hike since the crisis began. Stan Shamu, IG\u2019s man in Melbourne, sets the scene: After recent comments by Fed members who increasingly sound more hawkish, this week\u2019s non-farm payrolls data will carry significant weight and go a long way towards shaping rate hike expectations. After a slump the previous month (142,000), non-farm payrolls are expected to bounce back strongly with a reading north of 200,000. Analysts feel a strong reading today could then see the Fed drop its \u2018considerable time\u2019 reference as far as rates lift-off is concerned. This month\u2019s FOMC meeting will also be when QE wraps up and therefore is likely to be pivotal for the greenback. In the meantime, we\u2019ll be watching the latest service sector data from Europe for signs that the economy may be recovering. Economists expect to see the Italy and France\u2019s service sectors both contracted again last month, while firms in Germany and the UK report stronger growth. We\u2019ll have all the data by 9.30am BST.....",

The worries which have hit markets hard - signs of economic weakness around the world, a disappointing update from the ECB, protests in Hong Kong, air strikes on Isis, trouble in Ukraine and concerns about the spread of ebola - have not gone away. But many investors clearly felt the falls had gone too far. The more positive mood was helped by the US revealing a better than expected non-farm payroll figure, with 248,000 jobs added in September compared to expectations of 215,000. July and August figures were also revised upwards.

      "body": "<p>After hitting a near ten month low on Thursday, markets managed to regain some lost ground, helped by better than expected US jobs figures.</p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 81.52 points or 1.2% higher to 6527.91 on Friday, as bargain hunters returned after the recent slump and the US reported 248,000 new jobs were created in September, better than an expected figure of 215,000.</p> <p>But the index has fallen 121 points or 1.8% since Monday after a 2.76% slide the previous week, on a toxic cocktail of concerns. Slowing economic growth, as evidenced by this week's manufacturing and service sector surveys, a disappointing update from the European Central Bank which failed to provide the hoped for stimulus to boost the flagging eurozone, worries about the repercussions of the current protests in Hong Kong, air strikes on Isis, the troubles in Ukraine and the spread of Ebola.</p> <p><strong>Tesco</strong> continued its slide in the wake of last month's warning it had discovered a \u00a3250m profit shortfall. Its shares lost 6.05p to 172.15p, a new eleven and a half year low, on talk of a possible dividend cut and a \u00a33bn rights issue. The cash call suggestion was denied to Reuters, with a spokesman saying it had \"no current plans\" for such a move.</p> <p>Other supermarkets continued to lose ground amid the relentless market share gains of discounters Aldi and Lidl. <strong>Morrisons</strong> dipped another 1.1p to 157.8p but despite this week's disappointing results, <strong>J Sainsbury</strong> recovered 2.6p to 227.4p.</p> <p>Commodity shares were under pressure again on concerns about Chinese growth prospects, as well as the recent falls in the oil price. With the strength of the dollar and talk of oversupply, Brent Crude fell another 1.7% on Friday to $91.8 a barrel.</p> <p><strong>Fresnillo</strong> fell 29.5p to 720p, <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> lost 38.5p to 2949.5p and <strong>Tullow Oil </strong>slipped 9.5p to 600p.</p> <p><strong>RSA Insurance</strong> fell 5.7p to 469.9p despite Deutsche Bank raising its price target from 440p to 505p.</p> <p>But <strong>easyJet</strong> soared 88p to \u00a314.59 as the budget airline raised its full year profit forecast from \u00a3545m-\u00a3570m to \u00a3575m-\u00a3580m, as it benefited from a strong summer travel period, lower fuel costs, favourable currency movements and a strike at Air France, which added around \u00a35m to revenues.</p> <p>British Airways and Iberia owner <strong>International Airlines Group</strong> was close behind, adding 17.3p to 365.2p, while cruise company <strong>Carnival </strong>sailed 101p higher to \u00a324.44, helped by the falling fuel prices.</p> <p><strong>Tui Travel</strong> - in the throes of merging with parent Tui AG - rose 12.9p to 393p as Natixis raised its price target from 395p to 420p in the wake of Thursday's trading update. Oriel was also positive, saying:</p> <blockquote> The update confirms that Tui Travel is on track to deliver an outcome for 2013/14 in line with our expectations. We consider the merger is a logical combination of two groups, which was virtually inevitable at some stage. The merger will unlock trapped value in Tui AG and should produce useful benefits, with Tui Travel shareholders benefiting from strong earnings per share accretion. Accordingly we consider the shares have good upside. </blockquote> <p><strong>United Utilities</strong> added 25.5p to 810p as it responded to regulator Ofwat's draft determination, saying it was \"seeking amendments to a small number of relatively minor specific issues.\" As part of this, customers could see their bills cut by up to 4.1%.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Debenhams</strong> ended 1.75p higher at 61.75p after Thursday's late news that Mike Ashley's <strong>Sports Direct International, </strong>15p better at 610p, had snapped up a 4.6% stake in the department store group to add to its recent derivative trade which could leave it holding a total of 11.2%.</p> <p>But transport group <strong>Go-Ahead</strong>, whose Govia joint venture recently took over the Great Northern and Thameslink franchise, lost 16p to \u00a325.23 after Shore Capital cut its recommendation from buy to hold. Analyst Martin Brown said its target of more than \u00a3100m of operating profit from its bus business by 2016 - the Target 100 project - was on track. But he added:</p> <blockquote> In terms of UK bus we now believe the market has all but baked in the delivery of Target 100, leaving little room for significant outperformance versus expectations. To our minds, it is therefore the rail business that must deliver in order for the shares to materially push on from here. <br> Unfortunately as a starting point, we are significantly downgrading our rail forecasts for 2015 and 2016 by 44% and 47% respectively. These downgrades result in our group operating profit forecasts falling by 15%, 23% respectively.  The broker has cut 2015 profit forecasts for Southeastern, reflecting a \u00a37m shortfall in the contribution from Great Northern and Thameslink compared to earlier expectations, and a \u00a310m loss from London Midland rather than breakeven. There are a number of reasons behind the downgrades; below we look at each year in turn. For 2016, Brown said: <br>London Midland is again the source of much of the downgrade with our forecast for this franchise of a \u00a312m profit, now a \u00a38m loss. The good news for investors is that the London Midland franchise ends in April 2016, with a direct award to Go-Ahead out to June 2017 anticipated ahead of the conclusion of bidding process for the new franchise. In addition, we introduce bid costs of \u00a38.5m for 2016 for the first time. Clearly this a negative in the short term, however it also reflects Go-Ahead's recent wins and momentum in rail, success breeds success or words to that effect. Our rail central costs also rise by \u00a31m. <br> <br>We remain firm supporters of the Go-Ahead management team and the strategy they continue to implement, however [the soon to be awarded] Crossrail aside, with no significant rail franchise news likely until the end of 2015 we believe there is better value elsewhere in the sector. <br> <br>In our opinion in order to reach \u00a330 a share Go-Ahead would need to increase its Target 100 towards Target 115- 120, which seems unlikely in the near term or it needs to win both Transpennine and Northern franchises. While the latter is most definitely possible, it will be 12 months before we find out. <br> <br>While not in our forecasts, we see scope for Go-Ahead to return via a special dividend or buy back up to \u00a3150m of cash to shareholders or around 14% of its market cap in the year to June 2016. </blockquote> <p>Finally <strong>Software Radio Technology</strong>, which supplies technology and products to track marine vessels around the globe, jumped 4.5% to 26p after it reported a 70% increase in first half revenues to \u00a35.4m and a profit of \u00a30.5m, compared to a \u00a3434,000 loss the previous year.</p> <p>The company, originally bought from Securicor in 2002 after current chief executive Simon Tucker overheard a train conversation suggesting that it might be up for sale, specialises in products using the International Marine Organisation's AIS standard, and has around 95% of its market. Part of its growth has come from governments mandating ship owners to use tracking equipment, and a key US ruling on the issue for American shipowners is due in December.

      "bodyText": "After hitting a near ten month low on Thursday, markets managed to regain some lost ground, helped by better than expected US jobs figures. The FTSE 100 finished 81.52 points or 1.2% higher to 6527.91 on Friday, as bargain hunters returned after the recent slump and the US reported 248,000 new jobs were created in September, better than an expected figure of 215,000. But the index has fallen 121 points or 1.8% since Monday after a 2.76% slide the previous week, on a toxic cocktail of concerns. Slowing economic growth, as evidenced by this week's manufacturing and service sector surveys, a disappointing update from the European Central Bank which failed to provide the hoped for stimulus to boost the flagging eurozone, worries about the repercussions of the current protests in Hong Kong, air strikes on Isis, the troubles in Ukraine and the spread of Ebola. Tesco continued its slide in the wake of last month's warning it had discovered a \u00a3250m profit shortfall. Its shares lost 6.05p to 172.15p, a new eleven and a half year low, on talk of a possible dividend cut and a \u00a33bn rights issue. The cash call suggestion was denied to Reuters, with a spokesman saying it had \"no current plans\" for such a move. Other supermarkets continued to lose ground amid the relentless market share gains of discounters Aldi and Lidl. Morrisons dipped another 1.1p to 157.8p but despite this week's disappointing results, J Sainsbury recovered 2.6p to 227.4p. Commodity shares were under pressure again on concerns about Chinese growth prospects, as well as the recent falls in the oil price. With the strength of the dollar and talk of oversupply, Brent Crude fell another 1.7% on Friday to $91.8 a barrel. Fresnillo fell 29.5p to 720p, Rio Tinto lost 38.5p to 2949.5p and Tullow Oil slipped 9.5p to 600p. RSA Insurance fell 5.7p to 469.9p despite Deutsche Bank raising its price target from 440p to 505p. But easyJet soared 88p to \u00a314.59 as the budget airline raised its full year profit forecast from \u00a3545m-\u00a3570m to \u00a3575m-\u00a3580m, as it benefited from a strong summer travel period, lower fuel costs, favourable currency movements and a strike at Air France, which added around \u00a35m to revenues. British Airways and Iberia owner International Airlines Group was close behind, adding 17.3p to 365.2p, while cruise company Carnival sailed 101p higher to \u00a324.44, helped by the falling fuel prices. Tui Travel - in the throes of merging with parent Tui AG - rose 12.9p to 393p as Natixis raised its price target from 395p to 420p in the wake of Thursday's trading update. Oriel was also positive, saying: The update confirms that Tui Travel is on track to deliver an outcome for 2013/14 in line with our expectations. We consider the merger is a logical combination of two groups, which was virtually inevitable at some stage. The merger will unlock trapped value in Tui AG and should produce useful benefits, with Tui Travel shareholders benefiting from strong earnings per share accretion. Accordingly we consider the shares have good upside. United Utilities added 25.5p to 810p as it responded to regulator Ofwat's draft determination, saying it was \"seeking amendments to a small number of relatively minor specific issues.\" As part of this, customers could see their bills cut by up to 4.1%. Among the mid-caps Debenhams ended 1.75p higher at 61.75p after Thursday's late news that Mike Ashley's Sports Direct International, 15p better at 610p, had snapped up a 4.6% stake in the department store group to add to its recent derivative trade which could leave it holding a total of 11.2%. But transport group Go-Ahead, whose Govia joint venture recently took over the Great Northern and Thameslink franchise, lost 16p to \u00a325.23 after Shore Capital cut its recommendation from buy to hold. Analyst Martin Brown said its target of more than \u00a3100m of operating profit from its bus business by 2016 - the Target 100 project - was on track. But he added: In terms of UK bus we now believe the market has all but baked in the delivery of Target 100, leaving little room for significant outperformance versus expectations. To our minds, it is therefore the rail business that must deliver in order for the shares to materially push on from here. Unfortunately as a starting point, we are significantly downgrading our rail forecasts for 2015 and 2016 by 44% and 47% respectively. These downgrades result in our group operating profit forecasts falling by 15%, 23% respectively. The broker has cut 2015 profit forecasts for Southeastern, reflecting a \u00a37m shortfall in the contribution from Great Northern and Thameslink compared to earlier expectations, and a \u00a310m loss from London Midland rather than breakeven. There are a number of reasons behind the downgrades; below we look at each year in turn. For 2016, Brown said: London Midland is again the source of much of the downgrade with our forecast for this franchise of a \u00a312m profit, now a \u00a38m loss. The good news for investors is that the London Midland franchise ends in April 2016, with a direct award to Go-Ahead out to June 2017 anticipated ahead of the conclusion of bidding process for the new franchise. In addition, we introduce bid costs of \u00a38.5m for 2016 for the first time. Clearly this a negative in the short term, however it also reflects Go-Ahead's recent wins and momentum in rail, success breeds success or words to that effect. Our rail central costs also rise by \u00a31m. We remain firm supporters of the Go-Ahead management team and the strategy they continue to implement, however [the soon to be awarded] Crossrail aside, with no significant rail franchise news likely until the end of 2015 we believe there is better value elsewhere in the sector. In our opinion in order to reach \u00a330 a share Go-Ahead would need to increase its Target 100 towards Target 115- 120, which seems unlikely in the near term or it needs to win both Transpennine and Northern franchises. While the latter is most definitely possible, it will be 12 months before we find out. While not in our forecasts, we see scope for Go-Ahead to return via a special dividend or buy back up to \u00a3150m of cash to shareholders or around 14% of its market cap in the year to June 2016. Finally Software Radio Technology, which supplies technology and products to track marine vessels around the globe, jumped 4.5% to 26p after it reported a 70% increase in first half revenues to \u00a35.4m and a profit of \u00a30.5m, compared to a \u00a3434,000 loss the previous year. The company, originally bought from Securicor in 2002 after current chief executive Simon Tucker overheard a train conversation suggesting that it might be up for sale, specialises in products using the International Marine Organisation's AIS standard, and has around 95% of its market. Part of its growth has come from governments mandating ship owners to use tracking equipment, and a key US ruling on the issue for American shipowners is due in December. If passed as expected, some 28,000 boats will need to install the equipment in seven months, a prospect which analysts believe could be worth some $35m in revenues to the business. Tucker said: With many more projects in progress, coupled with the existing mandates and the pending US mandate in particular, we are excited about the future.",

      "bodyText": "John Lewis\u2019s managing director has apologised for a string of derogatory remarks about France, as the deputy mayor of Paris dismissed his tirade as \u201cfalse and idiotic\u201d. Andy Street told a gathering of British entrepreneurs on Thursday night that France was \u201csclerotic, hopeless and downbeat\u201d and urged them to get out if they had investments there because the country was \u201cfinished\u201d. His comments sparked outrage in France and a sharp rebuttal from Jean-Louis Missika, a deputy Paris mayor in charge of economic development and the attractiveness of Paris to investors. He told the Guardian that if Andy Street was joking, perhaps Paris should respond in kind. \u201cWhat he says is false and idiotic. As we say, everything excessive is exaggerated, but then it seems French bashing is all the fashion chez vous. \u201cFactually it\u2019s false because figures show that last year Paris attracted more foreign investment than London, and because Paris is a dynamic city with a quality of service that is often better than in London. \u201cBut this guy has shops in London, right, so of course he wants to attract people away from the shops in Paris. I think it\u2019s called publicity.\u201d Street, who is launching a French-language version of John Lewis\u2019s website soon, apologised on Friday afternoon as the reaction to his comments snowballed. Waitrose, the John-Lewis-owned supermarket, also has a deal to sell food on Eurostar. \u201cThe remarks I made were supposed to be lighthearted views, and tongue in cheek,\u201d said Street. \u201cOn reflection I clearly went too far. I regret the comments, and apologise unreservedly.\u201d However, the French embassy in the UK also offered a riposte. Mindful that the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, visits London next week, the embassy said France was the fifth biggest country for foreign direct investment, showing that Street was in a small minority among business people. \u201cSaying that \u2018nothing works in France\u2019 shows how wide of the mark those comments are. Everyone who has lived in France knows that it enjoys world-class public services. Public transport for example is excellent, and at a price that Mr Street is unlikely to find in many countries. People working in France enjoy one of the best healthcare systems in the world. And ultimately, workers\u2019 average productivity is higher in France than in many other developed countries. \u201cPrime Minister Manuel Valls will deliver a speech at the Guildhall on Monday. If Mr Street takes the time to listen to it, he will find out that far from being sclerotic, France is engaged in wide-ranging structural reforms. France is the fifth biggest economy in the world, the second in Europe. It would be senseless for any major international business to overlook such a market.\u201d Street made his comments, reported in the Times, at an event in London marking the end of a John Lewis competition for startup companies. Earlier this week he was in Paris to pick up a retail award for his company. He told the gathering of entrepreneurs that the award was \u201cmade of plastic and is frankly revolting\u201d. \u201cIf I needed any further evidence of a country in decline, here it is. Every time I [see it], I shall think, God help France,\u201d he said. The eurozone\u2019s second largest economy - behind Germany - is struggling for growth under president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and the country is not budgeting to come within the EU\u2019s 3% budget deficit target until 2017. The French economy has been hampered by low growth and poor tax receipts in recent years. David Cameron annoyed the French government two years ago when he promised to \u201croll out the red carpet\u201d for French companies seeking to avoid higher taxes on the rich. Street also branded the Gare du Nord in Paris \u201cthe squalor pit of Europe\u201d, in contrast to London\u2019s revamped St Pancras station at the other end of the Eurostar line. Missika said that the problems of the Gare du Nord were \u201cknown and being addressed. We are able to identify our problems, you know, and do something to treat them.\u201d Street is not the first British executive to make undiplomatic comments in off-guard moments. In 2000, Christopher Gent, the then chief executive of Vodafone, deployed a German accent while watching a cricket match to describe the head of takeover target Mannesmann as being \u201cmore into German poetry and chess\u201d. In 2010, Sir Alan Sugar offended Nigeria\u2019s high commission when he told a contestant on The Apprentice that he had received a dubious business offer from Nigeria that did not materialise.",

      "bodyText": "Miller Homes has scrapped its planned flotation as investors grow wary of prospects for the UK housing market. The Edinburgh-based housebuilder had planned to raise \u00a3140m by selling shares to investors on the stock market. The initial public offering (IPO) would have valued the company at between \u00a3450m and \u00a3550m. Announcing the flotation last Tuesday, Miller said it was an excellent time for housebuilders, with growing demand for new houses, a growing economy and an improved mortgage market. Since then, shares of publicly traded rivals such as Barratt Developments have been hit as investors have become jittery about the property market. In a brief statement to the stock exchange, Miller said its shareholders, led by the private equity firm Blackstone, would continue to back the housebuilder without raising money in the public markets. \u201cIn light of the recent financial markets volatility, the shareholders of Miller Group have elected not to proceed at this time with a public offering of Miller Homes. The shareholders are excited to support Miller Homes in its next phase of growth as the company builds upon the momentum evidenced in its recent operational and financial results.\u201d House prices fell for the first time in 17 months in September, Nationwide said on Tuesday. Potential homebuyers are reported to be worried about warnings of a property bubble and the effect of interest rate rises expected to start early next year. The Bank of England is also seeking new powers to intervene in the buy-to-let market to stop a runaway housing market disrupting the financial system. Miller cancelled its IPO as Aldermore, the specialist bank for small businesses, said it would press ahead with its share sale. Aldermore, which announced its intention to float last week, set the price range for its shares at between 217p and 265p, with the midpoint valuing the bank at \u00a3800m. Miller is the third property company to cancel an IPO in a little over two months. Urban Exposure, an investment vehicle that finances construction of new homes, and Clipstone, a property management firm, both cancelled planned floats. After a frenzy of demand for flotations early in the year, investors have become more choosy after a series of IPOs left them out of pocket. But after companies raised \u00a312.2bn in the past nine months, flotation advisers expect the market to pick up again after the summer lull and to see a strong pipeline of deals going into next year. Miller\u2019s cancelled float means Tony Rice, the chairman recruited to take the company public, will leave the company along with two other non-executive directors.",

      "body": "<p>After four days of decline, leading shares have managed a slight recovery, with <strong>easyJet</strong> soaring after a well received trading update.</p> <p>The budget airlline raised its full year profit forecast from \u00a3545m-\u00a3570m to \u00a3575m-\u00a3580m, as it benefited from a strong summer travel period, lower fuel costs, favourable currency movements and a strike at Air France, which added around \u00a35m to revenues.</p> <p>The news has sent easyJet flying 97p or 7% higher to \u00a314.68, the biggest riser in the leading index. Analysts were also positive on the update. Robin Byde at Cantor Fitzgerald said:</p> <blockquote> EasyJet is trading on a 2015 PE of 10.5 times which is about in-line with the European sector, but at a 17% discount to its 5-year average historic PE metric. We forecast that easyJet will pay a dividend for 2014 of 46.5p, yielding 3.3% (based on a 40% payout ratio). <br> We also believe that there is a significant chance that the board will announce a special dividend. Last year easyJet paid a total dividend of 77.6p including a 44.1p special  Aside from its attractive valuation and dividend yield, we think that easyJet will continue to take market share from the flag carriers in key markets such as Germany, France and Italy as these companies attempt to restructure their own short-haul operations. We reiterate our buy recommendation and target price of 1,600p. </blockquote> <p>Jefferies said:</p> <blockquote> We expect modest consensus upgrades and a positive market reaction. We are more cautious into winter but fuel help, and a higher profit base, leaves us happy with our above consensus 2015 estimates for now. <br> </blockquote> <p>Close behind easyJet was <strong>Tui Travel</strong>, up 12.3p at 392.4p as Natixis raised its price target from 395p to 420p in the wake of Thursday's trading update.</p> <p><strong>United Utilities</strong> is up 25p at 809.5p as it responded to regulator Ofwat's draft determination, saying it was \"seeking amendments to a small number of relatively minor specific issues.\" As part of this, customers could see their bills cut by up to 4.1%.</p> <p>Overall, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is currently up 52.55 points at 6498.94. On Thursday it hit its lowest level since December last year, on a toxic cocktail of concerns. Slowing economic growth, as evidenced by recent manufacturing surveys, a disappointing report from the European Central Bank which failed to provide the hoped for stimulus to boost the flagging eurozone, protest in Hong Kong, air strikes on Isis and the spread of Ebola.</p> <p>But despite new service sector surveys showing slowing growth, investors were dipping their toes back in the water ahead of the US non-farm payroll numbers in the afternoon. Mike McCudden at Interactive Investor said:</p> <blockquote> With the FTSE 100 finding a new low for 2014 the bargain hunters are out in earnest this morning. The bounce in the US market has managed to stem the selling pressure in the short term but many investors will await for the key jobs data later today before they commit. <br> While geo-political risks remain amidst growing concern over the downturn in China and the fate of the euro zone, the bounce witnessed today may indeed be a short term blip. </blockquote> <p>There was no blip, short term or otherwise, for <strong>Tesco</strong> after its recent travails. With investment guru Warren Buffett saying his investment in the supermarket was a mistake, its shares are down another 2.55p to 175.65, a new eleven year low.</p> <p><strong>RSA Insurance</strong> has fallen 5.6p to 470p despite Deutsche Bank raising its price target from 440p to 505p.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Debenhams</strong> has added 3p to 63p after news that Mike Ashley's <strong>Sports Direct International</strong> had snapped up a 4.6% stake in the department store group to add to its recent derivative trade which could leave it holding a total of 11.2%.</p> <p>Sports Direct is up 14p at 609p and analysts at its broker Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> The relevant issues here are what Sports Direct's intentions are, the financial implications and how to probability-weight a small amount of knowledge into the share prices of Sports Direct and Debenhams. <br> Sports Direct is now in four Debenhams units \u2013 Harrow, Southsea, Bristol and Guildford \u2013 up from the initial two. There is no information on how these are going and they are all at such an early stage that we would not regard any disclosure as meaningful.  Investors have been averse to the Group's M&amp;A activity in our view as it does not conform to the predictable pattern best-liked by retail-followers. But we would point to the value created for shareholders over time by the aggregate of the Group's various strategies.

The budget airlline raised its full year profit forecast from \u00a3545m-\u00a3570m to \u00a3575m-\u00a3580m, as it benefited from a strong summer travel period, lower fuel costs, favourable currency movements and a strike at Air France, which added around \u00a35m to revenues. The news has sent easyJet flying 97p or 7% higher to \u00a314.68, the biggest riser in the leading index. Analysts were also positive on the update. Robin Byde at Cantor Fitzgerald said: EasyJet is trading on a 2015 PE of 10.5 times which is about in-line with the European sector, but at a 17% discount to its 5-year average historic PE metric. We forecast that easyJet will pay a dividend for 2014 of 46.5p, yielding 3.3% (based on a 40% payout ratio). We also believe that there is a significant chance that the board will announce a special dividend. Last year easyJet paid a total dividend of 77.6p including a 44.1p special Aside from its attractive valuation and dividend yield, we think that easyJet will continue to take market share from the flag carriers in key markets such as Germany, France and Italy as these companies attempt to restructure their own short-haul operations. We reiterate our buy recommendation and target price of 1,600p. Jefferies said: We expect modest consensus upgrades and a positive market reaction. We are more cautious into winter but fuel help, and a higher profit base, leaves us happy with our above consensus 2015 estimates for now. Close behind easyJet was Tui Travel, up 12.3p at 392.4p as Natixis raised its price target from 395p to 420p in the wake of Thursday's trading update. United Utilities is up 25p at 809.5p as it responded to regulator Ofwat's draft determination, saying it was \"seeking amendments to a small number of relatively minor specific issues.\" As part of this, customers could see their bills cut by up to 4.1%. Overall, the FTSE 100 is currently up 52.55 points at 6498.94. On Thursday it hit its lowest level since December last year, on a toxic cocktail of concerns. Slowing economic growth, as evidenced by recent manufacturing surveys, a disappointing report from the European Central Bank which failed to provide the hoped for stimulus to boost the flagging eurozone, protest in Hong Kong, air strikes on Isis and the spread of Ebola. But despite new service sector surveys showing slowing growth, investors were dipping their toes back in the water ahead of the US non-farm payroll numbers in the afternoon. Mike McCudden at Interactive Investor said: With the FTSE 100 finding a new low for 2014 the bargain hunters are out in earnest this morning. The bounce in the US market has managed to stem the selling pressure in the short term but many investors will await for the key jobs data later today before they commit. While geo-political risks remain amidst growing concern over the downturn in China and the fate of the euro zone, the bounce witnessed today may indeed be a short term blip. There was no blip, short term or otherwise, for Tesco after its recent travails. With investment guru Warren Buffett saying his investment in the supermarket was a mistake, its shares are down another 2.55p to 175.65, a new eleven year low. RSA Insurance has fallen 5.6p to 470p despite Deutsche Bank raising its price target from 440p to 505p. Among the mid-caps Debenhams has added 3p to 63p after news that Mike Ashley's Sports Direct International had snapped up a 4.6% stake in the department store group to add to its recent derivative trade which could leave it holding a total of 11.2%. Sports Direct is up 14p at 609p and analysts at its broker Espirito Santo said: The relevant issues here are what Sports Direct's intentions are, the financial implications and how to probability-weight a small amount of knowledge into the share prices of Sports Direct and Debenhams. Sports Direct is now in four Debenhams units \u2013 Harrow, Southsea, Bristol and Guildford \u2013 up from the initial two. There is no information on how these are going and they are all at such an early stage that we would not regard any disclosure as meaningful. Investors have been averse to the Group's M&amp;A activity in our view as it does not conform to the predictable pattern best-liked by retail-followers. But we would point to the value created for shareholders over time by the aggregate of the Group's various strategies. If Sports Direct was not aggressive it would not now be on the point of becoming a major international force.",

Raecorp International, also known as RCI Military Logistics, won a series of defence contracts worth more than $13m to supply port services to the Royal Australian Navy, including work at Manus Island and in ports around the world. Almost 100 local and foreign companies have been left without payment and may never be able to recover their losses. The list of creditors includes government agencies such as the tax office and Workcover Queensland, as well as companies such as Telstra, Vodafone and port authorities around the world. The owner of the company, William Rae, is a Brisbane businessman who was the founding director of the Brisbane Bombers\u2019 bid for NRL status and was later involved in a takeover bid for the Gold Coast Titans. Creditors owed money by Raecorp have been unable to contact Rae. His last known place of business in Queensland is empty and has been put on the market. His past business ventures have spanned a broad range of fields and several continents, including one venture in which he boasted that his company provided wagyu beef to the White House. Raecorp\u2019s insolvency raises serious concerns that the Department of Defence ignored warning signs about its stability before it was awarded the contract. A Guardian Australia investigation into Raecorp\u2019s activities shows courts had found that the business or related entities had acted inappropriately at the time it was awarded. The relationship between the Department of Defence and Raecorp has deteriorated so badly that Raecorp attempted to sue the department in April over a pay dispute relating to the company\u2019s work assisting the defence force while the Manus Island detention centre was being built in 2013. Raecorp\u2019s conduct concerned the department so much that it referred the company to the Australian federal police (AFP) for investigation in June 2013. The department has severed its remaining ties with Raecorp, but has defended awarding the contract to the company. Greens senator Scott Ludlam said it was \u201can extraordinary debacle\u201d and called on the Department of Defence to investigate the circumstances of awarding the contract. \u201cThere should be an inquiry from defence as to how this was allowed to occur,\u201d he said. \u201cHow was this contract awarded in the first place given the case history that was in the public domain and how can we prevent it happening in the future?\u201d Rae has not replied to emails or calls. His solicitor and a former business associate also failed to respond to requests for comment. A \u2018lack of business honesty and integrity\u2019 Raecorp has been the subject of several adverse findings by courts and other public authorities dating back to 2007. An early warning came in 2010, when the US defence logistics agency found that in 2007 Raecorp had filed inappropriate tax claims, had not complied with terms of its contracts and had failed to pay subcontractors.

Raecorp was named as a co-defendant in the case, which also involved one of Rae\u2019s other companies, UBS Provedores, and a 2006 contract with the United States Defence Energy Support Center (Desc). In 2007 a US district court judge took issue with claims that Rae\u2019s company had not been paid for services it had provided to a Norwegian shipping company, Wilhelmsen. \u201cUBS [Provedores] claims that the reason it has not been paid by the US government for the bunkering is because Wilhelmsen failed to produce substantiating documentation. There is nothing in the record to support UBS\u2019 assertion that it had not been paid. To the contrary, documentation from both DESC and Military Sealift Command indicate that UBS has been paid in full for the Wilhelmsen bunkerings,\u201d the judgment said. Despite these findings, the Australian Department of Defence entered into the contract with Raecorp in early 2011. The department\u2019s procurement guidelines note that one risk factor to be considered in awarding a tender is \u201cwhether there is a history of controversy and litigation\u201d. Guardian Australia put detailed questions to the department about how Raecorp was awarded the contract. A spokeswoman said in a statement: \u201cDefence conducted the tender process in full accordance with the commonwealth procurement guidelines in existence at the time. Asked whether any review of procurement processes had been undertaken, she said: \u201cDefence regularly reviews its procurement practices to ensure that procurement and contracting requirements deliver value for money. Defence conducts risk assessments in its procurements and considers risks and their potential impact when making decisions relating to value for money assessments, approvals of proposals to spend public money and the terms of the contract.\u201d The AFP confirmed the department referred the company for investigation in June 2013. \u2018Shredding of documents\u2019 alleged The collapse of Raecorp has left frustrated creditors, who have been unable to contact Rae and may never be able to recover their losses. The list of creditors includes almost 100 entities, including the tax office and Workcover Queensland, as well as port authorities in Australia and overseas. One of the largest is the Total Food Network, which is owed $184,988 for work it provided in Papua New Guinea. Company director Lui Garozzo said the group had suffered serious losses as a result of its dealings with Raecorp. \u201cWe didn\u2019t just lose on product we bought and sold. We had to air-freight product to very remote places so the impact on the business is quite large,\u201d he said. Some companies have started to take legal action. The ANZ Bank is suing Rae personally for $1m relating to a credit card arrangement. Another creditor, Freshcorp, succeeded in gaining an order against Rae from the Western Australian magistrates court in August for $8,408 worth of goods it provided. In April Raecorp was ordered by the Queensland civil and administrative tribunal to pay Australian Reef Pilots $12,221. In emails between the company and Rae obtained by Guardian Australia, Rae told the company the reason for not paying its outstanding debt was a legal dispute with the commonwealth. \u201cDue to a dispute with the commonwealth, we are currently awaiting funds from the commonwealth and when funds reach RCI we will on forward to yourself,\u201d Rae wrote. Rae\u2019s email appears to refer to a court action for damages Raecorp had brought against the defence department in the Queensland district court in April 2014. The statement of claim shows that the company is claiming $83,806 from the department for invoices that were not paid. The department has argued in response it owes Raecorp no money, and that all invoices were paid. In the last correspondence Rae had with the company, Australian Reef Pilots warned it would seek an enforcement warrant issued by the magistrates court over the payment. Rae responded: \u201cUnderstand the below. This has just come to my attention and understand your below concerns yet it arrived on my desk today and I sent you the below email upon acknowledge. Please feel free to call me at any time and as I said below payment will be done and I am giving my word and I apologise and happy to meet and discuss as well.\u201dThe company was not paid. A Brisbane magistrates court enforcement officer later attempted to execute the warrant at Raecorp\u2019s last known address in Queensland. The bailiff\u2019s report notes multiple attempts had been made to execute the warrant, but the business was found to be empty and a neighbouring business had reported \u201cshredding of documents\u201d. After Raecorp went into voluntary liquidation, creditors met the appointed liquidator to discuss the debts on 23 June. The chief executive of Reef Pilots, Simon Meyjes, told Guardian Australia: \u201cThere\u2019s millions involved in this, and we\u2019re an unsecured creditor. It was quite obvious we were only a small fish in a very big pond.\u201d The creditors who attended the meeting asked how events had escalated so far, and at least one asked whether the liquidator would pursue an insolvent trading claim against Rae. \u201cThe chairperson outlined the investigations that would be undertaken and what would be required to pursue a claim,\u201d the meeting\u2019s minutes said. \u201cThe chairperson advised he would submit a report to Asic [the Australian Securities and Investments Commission] and may require funding to pursue a claim should it be commercial to do so.\u201d The Department of Defence spokeswoman said: \u201cAny outstanding debts incurred by Raecorp are now a matter for the company\u2019s liquidator to resolve.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Wonga, the controversial payday lender, has been forced by the new City regulator to write off \u00a3220m of loans to 375,000 borrowers that it now admits should never have been given loans. The company, which charges annualised interest rates of up to 5,853% a year and has been accused by MPs of \u201clegal loan sharking\u201d, said it would entirely wipe out loans to 330,000 people, and scrap interest and charges owed by a further 45,000 customers. Some of the loans are understood to be more than a year old and have ballooned from a few hundred pounds to thousands. Wonga\u2019s new chief executive, Andy Haste - who has been brought in to overhaul the tarnished brand \u2013 said the company had been wrong to lend money to people who could never afford to pay it back. \u201cWe are taking action to address the failing of the past. This business had been too focused on growth and cared more about the loan outcome than the customer outcome. We are clearly very sorry for what\u2019s happened to our customers and are doing everything to put that right.\u201d He said Wonga lacked experienced credit professionals and \u201clent to people we should not have lent to\u201d, adding: \u201cThe checks were not sophisticated enough and not strong enough.\u201d Wonga was forced to take action by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, in an unprecedented crackdown on the payday loans industry. FCA officials have investigated Wonga\u2019s practices at its offices in Camden, north London, and have hauled in Haste and other bosses to its head office in Canary Wharf. Wonga was required to write off the debts because the FCA found that it had granted the loans without checking people could afford the repayments. The checks were found to be so poor that many borrowers had no chance of ever repaying the loan because of their dire financial circumstances, with many living on unemployment or disability benefits. \u201cWe are determined to drive up standards in the consumer credit market and it is disappointing that some firms still have a way to go to meet our expectations,\u201d said Clive Adamson, the FCA\u2019s director of supervision. \u201cThis should put the rest of the industry on notice \u2013 they need to lend affordably and responsibly.\u201d The latest FCA action comes just months after Wonga was censured by the regulator for sending threatening letters to its customers from fake law firms named after its employees. Wonga will write off all the outstanding debts of 330,000 people who are more than 30 days in arrears. A further 45,000 people who are less than 30 days in arrears as of 2 October can repay their loans without interest or charges. The customers affected will be notified by 10 October. Wonga refused to state the original value of the loans or how long they had been outstanding. It estimated the write offs \u2013 which are more than five times its annual profits \u2013 will cost it about \u00a335m as it has already made provisions for many of the loans never being repaid. Haste, a respected City veteran who joined the company in the summer, said he would \u201cnot apportion blame\u201d to Wonga\u2019s founder Errol Damelin, who quit the firm in June. Damelin described Wonga\u2019s interest rate as a \u201cgreat deal\u201d and called for tougher regulation to \u201ckeep the bad guys out\u201d. The lender, he claimed, used sophisticated algorithms to ensure it did not lend to people who couldn\u2019t afford to repay. Damelin, who founded Wonga in 2006, had hoped to collect a \u00a3100m windfall from floating Wonga on the stock market at a suggested \u00a31bn valuation. Sources at the company said plans for a float have been scrapped. Haste said the company, which has been accused by the Archbishop of Canterbury of destroying lives, needs an urgent image overhaul and may even change its name. MPs on Thursday called for Haste, Damelin and other Wonga bosses past and present to be hauled before parliament. John Mann, a Labour MP on the Treasury select committee, said: \u201cI welcome today\u2019s latest step to crack down on irresponsible payday lenders \u2026 this is a company that has taken advantage of people in dire financial circumstances. \u201cSadly, it comes as no surprise to learn that Wonga knowingly lent money to people who will never be able to afford to repay a loan and it is morally right that they have been forced to write off these loans. Fellow Labour MP and Treasury select committee member Pat McFadden, said: \u201cThese findings drive a coach and horses through the claim that Wonga has been lending responsibly.\u201d Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chairman of the Treasury committee, said: \u201cMany consumers are still being treated badly by financial firms \u2013 new cases just keep coming. We will want reassurance that these firms have cleaned up their act, and Wonga may well be one of them.\u201d Stella Creasy, the Labour MP who has campaigned against payday lenders\u2019 practices and was subjected to personal attacks from Wonga staff, welcomed the FCA\u2019s crackdown but said writing off the loans \u201cdoes not go far enough to make up the damage and misery caused to so many lives \u2026 The FCA are clearly turning over stones and finding some very unpleasant things underneath\u201d. \u201cThey will have my full support if they see something criminal and want to take action.\u201d . Wonga said it intended to make good affected customers\u2019 credit ratings and was contacting credit reference agencies. The company could be forced to make further payouts in the future as the FCA searches for other Wonga customers who should not have been granted loans but did manage to pay them off. Wonga said it had changed its lending criteria immediately to put greater scrutiny on customers finances and their \u201cloan to income ratio\u201d. It will also prevent people who have been in arrears or rejected for a loan from reapplying for at least 30 days. Previously someone who had made late repayments, but then paid off a loan could immediately apply for another one. Wonga warned investors, already reeling from a 53% fall in profits announced on Tuesday, that the changes will lead to \u201ca material drop in the number of loans to new and existing customers\u201d.",
