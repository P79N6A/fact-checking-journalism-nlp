      "bodyText": "The red cup fiasco failed to take the froth off Starbucks\u2019s 2015 sales. The coffee giant reported better-than-expected sales growth during its holiday quarter. One in six American adults received a Starbucks gift card over the holiday \u2013 up from one in seven in 2014. Total net revenue rose 11.9 to $5.37bn, Starbucks announced on Thursday. Additionally, global sales at cafes open for more than a year rose 8% in the first quarter. Analysts expect those sales to rise by 7.3%. Net income attributable to the company fell to $687.6m, or 46 cents per share, from $983.1m, or 65 cents per share. The company came under fire during the holiday season after it introduced plain red cups instead of the traditional cups that used to be adorned with Christmas-themed illustrations. Some customers even went as far as to accuse the company of waging a war on Christmas. Donald Trump, 2016 presidential candidate and Republican frontrunner, was so outraged over the lack of Christmas design on Starbucks\u2019s cups that he suggested a boycott of the chain. \u201cI have one of the most successful Starbucks in Trump Tower. Maybe we should boycott Starbucks? I don\u2019t know. Seriously, I don\u2019t care. That\u2019s the end of that lease, but who cares?\u201d Trump told a crowd in Springfield, Illinois, in November. \u201cIf I become president, we\u2019re all going to be saying Merry Christmas again, that I can tell you.\u201d The company said that the two-toned red cups were designed that way for \u201ccustomers to tell their Christmas stories in their own way\u201d. \u201cThis year we wanted to usher in the holidays with a purity of design that welcomes all of our stories,\u201d said Jeffrey Fields, Starbucks\u2019s vice-president of design and content. \u201cWe\u2019re embracing the simplicity and the quietness of it.\u201d The minimalistic red cup design did not seem to upset the majority of the customers, as a record $1.9bn were loaded on Starbucks cards in the US and Canada during the first quarter. \u201cWe\u2019ve entered fiscal 2016 with another record-breaking quarter and a continuation of the accelerating momentum we saw in our business throughout 2015,\u201d said Scott Maw, Starbucks\u2019s chief financial officer. Membership in the Starbucks loyalty program increased by 23% and the number of active members surpassed 11 million in the US. During the first quarter, the company opened 528 net new stores globally. A record 281 of those stores were in China and Asia Pacific. Earlier this month, Starbucks said that it is on track to open 500 stores in China this year. By 2019, it expects to have a total of 3,400 stores in China. \u201cOver time, it\u2019s conceivable that China could become our largest market,\u201d said Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. Starbucks currently has 2,000 stores in China, making it the company\u2019s second largest market after the US. The company has more than 12,000 stores in the US.",

      "bodyText": "The veteran billionaire speculator and philanthropist, George Soros, has launched an astonishing attack on Donald Trump, accusing the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for the US presidency of \u201cdoing the work\u201d of Islamic State. Speaking at a dinner in Davos, Soros broke off from giving his views on the fragile state of global financial markets and the migration crisis to decry Trump and Ted Cruz, a rival Republican, of driving muslims to terrorism. \u201cBy fear-mongering, he and [Ted] Cruz are doing the work of Isis,\u201d Soros said. \u201cThey want people to turn against the Muslim community and make the Muslim community think there is no alternative to terrorism. It turns the Muslim community into a breeding ground for Isis.\u201d Trump caused controversy when he said there should be \u201ca complete and total ban\u201d on Muslims entering the US. Trump\u2019s words brought a strong response from Soros, who said it was \u201charmful\u201d when people did things out of fear. The investor, made famous by his attack on the pound that led to Britain\u2019s departure from the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992, said the migration crisis was causing Europe to \u201cfall apart\u201d, adding that refugees had been treated better when he was fleeing totalitarianism in the 1940s and 1950s. \u201cI was a migrant for 15 years, but migrants were treated better in those days. I could study, get a job, get travel documents, and think about making $100,000 before retiring. All this while I was a displaced person.\u201d Soros said Vladimir Putin was making the migration crisis worse by authorising Russia\u2019s bombing of civilians in Syria. \u201cHe wants the EU to collapse,\u201d he said. He added that he did not think the Russian president was serious about reaching a political solution to the civil war in Syria. \u201cThe EU is in an existential crisis as a result of migration,\u201d Soros said. \u201cThe EU is falling apart.\u201d Backing the idea of a Marshall Plan for countries neighbouring Syria, Soros said he was thrilled that the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, a strong supporter of budgetary austerity, had backed the idea. Soros said: \u201cMost people know that something has gone terribly wrong. It has to be put right.\u201d Soros said on migration: \u201cWe have reached a tipping point where the influx reduces the capacity of receiving countries assimilate or integrate the refugees and we have a panic. It is like a cinema on fire without exit signs.\u201d On the global economy, he said the same conditions were in place as those that caused the crisis in 2008. \u201cThere is a financial crisis and a bear market,\u201d said Soros. \u201cThe source of the disequilibrium is different. In 2008 it was US sub-prime housing. Today it is China, where a hard landing is practically unavoidable.\u201d Soros said 2016 was going to be a difficult year. There would be no further rate rises from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank would ease policy in March.",

He added: \u201cBy fearmongering he and (Ted) Cruz are doing the work of Isis. They want people to turn against the Muslim community and make the Muslim community think there is no alternative to terrorism. It turns the Muslim community into a breeding ground for Isis. Last month, Donald Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d on Muslims entering the US. This prompted a huge petition to have the businessman and presidential candidate banned from the UK, which MPs debated earlier this week. During the debate, Trump was labelled (among other things) a \u201cridiculous xenophobe\u201d. Soros said Vladimir Putin was making the crisis worse by his bombing of civilians in Syria. \u201cHe wants the EU to collapse.\u201d Soros then warned that European countries were in crisis, due to the number of people who have fled to the region: \u201cWe have reached a tipping point where the influx reduces the capacity of receiving countries assimilate or integrate the refugees and we have a panic. It is like a cinema on fire without exit signs.\u201d Soros said 2016 was going to be a difficult year. There would be no further rate rises from the Federal Reserve and the ECB would ease policy in March, he predicted (as Mario Draghi hinted today). George Soros, the billionaire financier turned philanthropist, has warned the World Economic Forum tonight that the migration crisis is putting the European Union in jeopardy. Larry Elliott was at the event, and reports: George Soros said: \u201cThe EU is in an existential crisis as a result of migration. The EU is falling apart.\u201d Backing the idea of a Marshall Plan, Soros said: \u201cMost people know that something has gone terribly wrong. It has to be put right.\u201d As we covered in this liveblog this morning, Germany\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has called for billions to be spent helping the troubled countries in the Middle East, to stem the flood of refugees into Europe. Soros added that the same conditions were in place as caused the crisis in 2008. \u201cThere is a financial crisis and a bear market. The source of the disequilibrium is different. In 2008 it was US sub prime. Today it is China where a hard landing is practically unavoidable.\u201d The Greek government says the talks between Lagarde and Tsipras were \u201csincere\u201d. Helena Smith has the details: The Greek government has just issued one of its famous briefing papers calling Tsipras\u2019 talks with IMF chief Christine Lagarde \u201csincere.\u201d The Greek PM \u201cunderlined that time is a critical parameter for the successful conclusion of the Greek programme and the first evaluation [of the economy\u2019s performance,]\u201d the paper said. Both agreed that from now on there should be \u201cdirect communication\u201d between the Greek government and the IMF \u201cso that each side has a clear view of the positions of the other,\u201d it noted. After saying it would be preferable if the IMF did not participate in Greece\u2019s latest bailout, Athens reluctantly agreed last week to the Washington-based body remaining amongst the lenders. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has met with Alexis Tsipras at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. It was a good meeting, one insider says. And the IMF has now issued a statement, reiterating that Greece needs significant debt relief, as well as pension reforms which are causing such anger in Athens. \u201cThe managing director reiterated that the IMF stands ready to continue to support Greece in achieving robust economic growth and sustainable public finances through a credible and comprehensive medium-term economic program. \u201cSuch a program would require strong economic policies, not least pension reforms as well as significant debt relief from Greece\u2019s European partners to ensure that debt is on a sustainable downward trajectory.\u201d While the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras was addressing delegates in Davos earlier today, opposition against the policies his government is being forced to apply intensified as thousands took to the streets. Our correspondent, Helena Smith, reports from Athens. Opposition to the pension and tax measures set as the price of further bailout funds mounted today as thousands of protestors \u2013mostly from the professions \u2013 joined farmers and fishermen and public sector unionists in denouncing the policies. As Tsipras hob-nobbed in Davos, around 10,000 demonstrators took to the streets \u2013 following up farmer blockades that also expanded - in further evidence that after months (some might say years) of being relatively inactive, the protest movement is once again gaining steam. For the most part, lawyers, doctors and engineers, many said they belonged to Greece\u2019s vast sector of self-employed who stood to be hard hit by the reforms. \u201cA lot of us here voted for the left and feel really betrayed,\u201d Baltis Kapopoulos, an Athenian engineer, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible that the left should be tainted by such policies,\u201d he said in front of the Greek parliament, a placard emblazoned with the words \u2018You won\u2019t kick us out of the country\u2019 above his head. At 29, Kapopoulos said he had no desire to leave Greece but like many might be forced to by the measures. \u201cIf they go through, pensions will drop, contributions will soar and taxes will double. There\u2019ll be a lot of black market work with no insurance. And it\u2019ll be the end of small firms.\u201d \u201cI think the reason there has been such a delay in protest is because people have been shocked. We voted \u2018no\u2019 in the referendum [last July] and 48 hours later, Tsipras went and accepted everything,\u201d he said of the leftist\u2019s spectacular surrender to creditors\u2019 demands under threat of Greece\u2019s ejection from the euro zone. \u201cEither we react now or we never will. It\u2019s the last chance if we don\u2019t want to be forced to leave our country.\u201d Felix Salmon, the sharp-as-a-very-sharp-tack financial columnist, has delivered his verdict on this year\u2019s Davos. And it\u2019s a zinger, surpassing Felix\u2019s earlier criticism of the annual shindig in the mountains. He argues that the excitement and chatter behind the scenes about Donald Trump (the antithesis of the spirit of Davos), shows that WEF\u2019s vision of an open, inclusive approach to solving the world\u2019s problems is failing. Especially as we seem to be collecting more problems, not fewer, from stock market turmoil and oil, to the Middle East. Over to Felix: This year, then, is proving itself to be the Davos of denial, the year that the disconnect between rhetoric and reality became more obvious than ever. The founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, is on some level a plutocratic power-broker just like many other rich and powerful men, but his dream of bringing the world together in the service of peace and prosperity is, or was, a genuine one. It has even been bought into by leftist critics who complain that Davos is \u201cincreasingly where global decisions are being taken and moreover is becoming the default form of global governance.\u201d The truth, however, is that with the exception of a few public-health initiatives, the Davos model of \u201cmulti-stakeholder initiatives\u201d and \u201cglobal redesign\u201d has utterly failed in its stated aims. The grandiloquence is as lofty as ever, but the world has not come together; instead, it is fracturing, and the World Economic Forum\u2019s manifold Leaders are reduced to the status of impotent spectators. Some men just want to watch the world burn; Davos Man wants nothing less. But, right now, that\u2019s all he can realistically do. In the financial markets, ECB president Mario Draghi has provided some respite today with his assurances that the central bank will review policy in March - hinting fresh stimulus could come sooner than many investors had been expecting. London\u2019s bluechip FTSE 100 index rebounded from a three-year low on Draghi\u2019s remarks, which followed assurances from his Bank of England counterpart Mark Carney this week that UK interest rates would stay at their record low amid turmoil on global markets and signs that the domestic economy had softened. The FTSE 100 closed up 100 points, or 1.8%, at 5,773.8 but it is still down more than 7% from the start of the year having sold off with other leading bourses around the world on worries over global growth and China\u2019s downturn. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 2% and on Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.2% and the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.8% at the time of the London close. Analysts cautioned that while Draghi\u2019s words had soothed markets for now, they would need to be followed with real action. Many recalled December\u2019s disappointment when ECB action was deemed much less aggressive than Draghi\u2019s prior promises had led investors to believe. \u201cECB president Draghi once again saw the equity markets confirm his \u2018super\u2019 status as they jumped almost as soon as he started his speech,\u201d said Alastair McCaig, analyst at online trading company IG. \u201cAll in all it was very impressive, especially when you consider he didn\u2019t actually promise anything, but he was convincing enough to get JP Morgan, RBS and Barclays to bring forward their calls for further easing from June to March.\u201d Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, commented: \u201cAlthough equity markets have lapped up the prospect of additional easing like manna from heaven, any euphoria derived from promises of central bank action may prove to be fleeting. Despite Draghi\u2019s assurances, it\u2019s still not clear if the ECB is willing to commit to the sort of massive, unconditional and open-ended QE programmes that we have seen from the Bank of Japan and the Fed.\u201d Now here\u2019s a turn-up. Davos attendees have voted that the answer to inequality lies more in wealth distribution than greater opportunity, we hear. At the start of the debate, the audience were split 65%-35% in favour of opportunity. But after a spirited debate, the vote was switched, reports Philip Jennings of the UNI Global union. George Osborne has denied that the EU renegotiations are hurting the UK economy, and claimed that the recent market volatility is actually a good thing: Speaking to CNBC here in Davos, he said: \u201cInternationally we need a big of a sense of perspective which is, underlying all this volatility are some transformations and transitions which are fundamentally good for the world \u2013 China becoming a more consumption based economy, energy being cheaper\u2026in the European Union and the euro zone, the European Central Bank ready to\u2026step in and support the euro zone.\u201d \u201cBecause of the very sharp falls in the oil price the markets are unstable\u2026but fundamentally for most western economies\u2026the fall in the price of energy is a good thing.\u201d This rather sums Davos up: Businesses at Davos are being urged to provide more financial assistance to help the world prepare for the next major pandemic. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, has warned that we are simply not ready for another serious outbreak, similar to the Ebola crisis that struck Africa last year. Speaking at Davos he says: Pandemics are not that rare, we have had a dozen in the last decade. He cites Sars, bird flu, Mers, influenza and the Zika virus as examples of diseases which could create a new pandemic. At the moment, vaccines do not exist for any of these viruses. This leaves the world very vulnerable, and we need to address it at the time between epidemics. As well as life-saving drugs, Farrar says countries also need to prepare their response plans, so they are not caught out when a pandemic begins. A new report, from the Commission on Creating a Global Health Risk Framework for the future, estimated that epidemics and pandemics cost the global economy $60 billion annually. Victor Dzau, who oversaw the commission, says: \u201cThe report calls the attention globally that this isn\u2019t just a health issue, it\u2019s a global security issue\u201d The report called for the World Health Organisation to be strengthened, and for more money for R&amp;D. In total, Farrar tells me, just 60 cents or 40p per person would make a dramatic difference in fighting pandemics. That\u2019s $4.5bn, which could come from governments and philanthropic groups as well as business. As Farrar puts it: If we did that, we could go a long way to avoiding another Ebola, or worse. Dr Zia Khan of the Rockefeller Foundation says businesses must do their bit: \u201cWe are looking to the business community, as well as G7 and others, to take up as a call to action. It is directly relevant to them\u201d. If you\u2019re just tuning in, please click here to see our earlier summary of the comments made by the French and Dutch PMs today. Our politics liveblog had rounded up Cameron\u2019s speech - here. In brief, they are that: Cameron said that he was \u201cnot in a hurry\u201d to get an EU deal by February (really, prime minister?) Cameron said there would still be many \u201cimperfect\u201d things about the EU even if he got the reform package he wanted. He urged business to start campaigning now for Britain to stay in a reformed EU. He said Britain could have \u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d in a reformed EU. Lets get back to Davos. And Carlos Ghosn, the CEO of Renault-Nissan, just told me that his company will cope fine if Britain chooses to leave the EU. Asked about the possibility of Brexit, Ghosn said: I\u2019m not worried. Whatever is the decision of the UK we will adapt to it. We will adapt to it. If the UK stays, we will continue what we\u2019re doing. If the UK decides to move out, we will adapt to the situation. I don\u2019t think there is a reason to worry. We knew for many years that this was possible. So we\u2019ll deal with it. But might you be forced to move jobs out of the UK, if we leave the EU? Frankly it\u2019s too early to talk about that. To sum up, ECB president Mario Draghi said the ECB would review and may reconsider its monetary policy in March, and that interest rates were likely to stay at low levels for some time. That hint of further stimulus was enough to send the euro lower against the pound and dollar, and give markets a boost. He also dismissed suggestions the ECB\u2019s governing council was split over December\u2019s decision to cut the deposit rate and extend the length of the QE programme. Last minutes showed governing council was divided, how confident are you you can get a majority for more easing measures. On the 2% target, ex-chief economist of ECB said target should be in longer term not medium because it harms ECB credibility. Disagree that minutes show such divisions. Today\u2019s line of communication was unanimous. We have got a majority over last four years, so should have no doubts the council has the willingness and cohesion necessary to take actions needed. On second point, when people say it should be lower than 2% while others say above, camps are divided. [Economist] confirmed validity of the target. The horizon of reaching this objective is his argument. View of council is we should reject any suggestion we may do less than what\u2019s necessary, in order to achieve target without undue delay. There are global events which could adversely affect objective, but not reason to give up. And with that, it\u2019s all over. Could markets get ahead of themselves as before December meeting? I abstained from blaming markets as such. Communication is a two way affair, hard to put blame of some disappointment on one side only. The council is open to use all necessary instruments to cope with the situation which is materially different from what it was at the beginning of December. In October, said you would re-examine in December and there was action. Is there any difference now? How worried are you about recent drop in inflation expectations? All inflation expectations have declined, and more worryingly, their correlation with inflation has increased. The council has the power, the willingness to act. What is message for countries like Spain whose disinflation is less effective. Is there a need for fiscal change in eurozone. Spain has achieved one of most significant progress in reform, country is now on its way to continue recovery and structural reforms. With very low inflation rates, the internal revaluations become more difficult. One of reasons inflation at 2% makes even more sense in a monetary union like ours. No disagreement on fiscal policy between ECB and EC. We are not the guardians, that is the EC. Fiscal consolidation should be growth friendly based on tax cuts, government spending control and possibly investment. There has been a wave of stock market selling, especially bank shares and Italian bank shares. You more or less gave a clean bill of health to banks, markets seem to disagree with your assessment. On non performing loans, you have asked for information so what is the purpose of this action? This allows me to clarify a confused perception. The NPLs were fully assessed in comprehensive assessment. Nothing new. The provisioning for these was fully determined. So no new unexpected provisioning or requests for more capital will be made by banking supervisor. On Italy, its banks have a level of provision similar to that prevailing in eurozone area, and a level of collatoral. European supervisor is aware it takes years to deal with NPLs, cannot be resolved with short period of time. Good example is Ireland - successful in terms of recovery and they are dealing with NPLs gradually. The questionaire was sent to several banks, not only Italy. It is an enquiry on how banks are managing NPLs. The purpose is to look at different national practices to get one best practice in time. Not an initiative to get banks to deal with NPLs urgently. Don\u2019t think markets disagree but there has been confusion. Hope this helps. Causes of movements in markets? Difficult to assess. Whether it will be transient or not, whether market adjust to a different level, better question for market analysts to answer. Regarding the fall in the oil price - wouldn\u2019t it be better to ignore effect of that. History suggests they will rise again for sure [and lift inflation], why not wait? When we have dramatic movement in commodities we look at three factors: persistence of these changes, if it was a short term effect we would look through it but this has not been our experience. Materiality, the size. Since December oil fell by 40%. Look at second round effects - low commodity prices do feed into other prices and that could generate what we want to avoid, spiralling down phenomona. So far don\u2019t have that, but have to be vigilent. We have to take seriously that low commodity prices for a long period may have second round effects that we want to take action against. Comment on China risks. On refugees, chancellor Merkel is taking a big risk and if situation worsens she could leave, was there a discussion on this domestic German crisis. On China, there have been three main developments - weaker PMI, situation in forex market, situation in stock market. All this generated sizeable capital outflows. We are monitoring. So far indicators suggest there is a gradual deceleration in line with our expectations. But outlook for eurozone area after these developments has been revised downwards. There has been a renewed decline in commodity and oil prices since December. On oil, supply and demand factors and what is happening in China is contributing to demand side. What do we expect? Chinese authorities have reputation for acting responsibly. In last two weeks they have been regaining control of policy. On refugees, can\u2019t talk about one country. Large change but could become opportunity. One of constraints on purchases is political. On financial turmoil have you seen signs of stress among investors, customers. If there were constraints, we will have technical work so we can use all instruments. On second point, best answer to recent developments is to make sure banking sector is resilient. Is a factual statement that all the actions taken have produced a much stronger banking sector than it was before the crisis. But should be cautious about not being too self congratulatory. The commodity volatility we are seeing would previously have tested banking system, but we have seen, they stand pretty resilient. Are you concerned about banking system and financial stability in light of what\u2019s happening in world. We are constantly monitoring financial sector, banking sector, trying to see whether central banks\u2019 monetary policies could become a source of financial instability. So far we have not seen signs of the potential financial instability of the like we have seen in the pre-crisis times. Not our mandate to protect banks\u2019 profitability but we are aware of consequences. Best answer is to ensure economy returns to growth, stable growth. Best answer for banking sector as well. You said no limits to what you could do, could you extend purchases to other classes of assets such as equities, lower other rates not just deposit. On refugee issue, are you concerned of effects of border closures on economy? I can only reiterate there are no limits. If we are to decide about a specific policy we want to be confident there are no technical limits to the size of its deployment. On refugees, this is an extraordinary development which is and will be changing the face of our society in Europe. It is in our hands, the opportunity, the ability to transform this development into an opportunity for future growth in Europe. We are not surrendering in front of these global actions. Our mandate is to reach a level of inflation at if not below 2%, even more determined in face of adverse events. Last month, you said monetary policy was adequate, now reviewing. Does this harm credibility. Inflation could fall below zero despite everything, do central banks not have as much control. Monetary policy has been quite effective - improvement in all financial conditions, now translated into real economic improvements. In December measures we decided were appropriate. But based on prevailing circumstances. We looked at exchange rate, price of oil, growth prospects of emerging markets. Since then, these circumstances have changed. Oil fallen by 40%, exchange rate fallen, and you can see situation of financial and commodity markets. Those measures in December were quite significant (NB one criticsim was the measures were watered down) The credibility of ECB would be harmed if we did not review and reconsider monetary policy stance when we have the full information. We have the determination to act and there are no limits within our mandate. The governing council was unanimous on this line of communication. (there was talk of a split) Now for questions. You will reconsider monetary policy stance in March, what measures do you have left and what can they do? Could you clarify position on Portugals Novo Banco where ECB not said to be involved in the bail in? Draghi: On second question, we are not the resolution authority. On monetary policy: In a speech in New York I said there are no limits to deploying instruments to reach objective of inflation at 2%. Don\u2019t want to discuss specifics of instruments. The euro is dropping as Draghi speaks, on the prospect of further action including perhaps further rate cuts: But European markets seem to like the talk, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.2% and France\u2019s Cac climbing 1.3%. ECB president Mario Draghi said the bank had decided to keep key interest rates unchanged, and it expected them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. He said the asset purchases under the QE programme were proceeding smoothly. He said it was clear that its monetary policies were working. Developments in the real economy, financing conditions have improved, strengthened the eurozone\u2019s resilience recent global market shocks. Extension of QE until March 2017 was appropriate, there was a significant addition of liquidity to the banking system. But he added: \u201cYet as we start the new year, downside risks have increased again amid heightened uncertainty about emerging market prospects, commodity markets, geopolitical risks. Eurozone inflation dynamics are also weaker than expected in December. It is necessary to review and reconsider our monetary policy stance in early March, when new economic projections become available.\u201d He said the fall in the oil price should help consumers and businesses, but the risks to eurozone growth remained to the downside. Inflation expectations will be low in coming months, and pick up only later in 2016. Here\u2019s the full text of the European Central Bank rate decision ahead of president Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference: At today\u2019s meeting the governing council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.30% respectively. And here\u2019s a comment from David Katimbo-Mugwanya, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management: The ECB will be keen to take stock in the coming weeks, preferring to appraise the effectiveness of its December policy actions rather than easing further in the immediate future. The central bank will have taken note, nevertheless, of persistent disinflationary pressures stemming from oil and commodity price weakness. Crowds are gathering in the Congress Hall for David Cameron\u2019s speech on Britain\u2019s Place in the World. As covered this morning, we expect the PM to call on business leaders to back him over the EU renegotiations. As it\u2019s a massive UK political story, my colleague Andy Sparrow is going to live blog it himself, here: You can watch the session live here: Just bumped into Jamie Dimon, boss of JP Morgan, whose bank is planning to back the In campaign on the UK EU referendum. He would not say how much the bank is spending - \u201cWe\u2019ve just started doing (it)...Wish we didn\u2019t have to do it at all\u201d. Q: So will JP Morgan stay if there is a no vote? That will depend on how Brexit happens, and which operations the bank could and couldn\u2019t keep in Britain, Dimon replies. He continues: \u201cBritain\u2019s been a great home for financial companies and it\u2019s benefited London quite a bit. We\u2019d like to stay there but if we can\u2019t, we can\u2019t. I can\u2019t tell the British people what to do, it\u2019s up to them\u201d Time for a quick recap. Britain\u2019s future in, or out, of Europe has dominated the morning of the second day of the World Economic Forum in Davos. A series of European politicians have urged the UK not to quit the European Union. Dutch PM Mark Rutte said Europe needs Britain\u2019s \u201coutward looking , trade oriented, growth oriented\u201d approach, and urged UK business and community leaders to speak out. French PM Manuel Valls said Brexit would be a tragedy, while German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble called it a disaster for Britain, and the EU. Valls also suggested that David Cameron will not succeed in completing his renegotiations next month. The migration crisis has also loomed large: Sch\u00e4uble called for a new Marshall Plan to tackle Europe\u2019s refugee crisis, saying billions must be spent. Rutte said that the Dublin agreement, under which migrants seek residency in the first EU country they register in, must be reformed. Otherwise the Schengen agreement allowing free movement across most EU countries will collapse. And Greek PM Alexis Tsipras said the EU needs to do more to help \u201ctransit countries\u201d such as Greece and devise a properly thought-out and paid-for relocation and resettlement plan. Tsipras also clashed with Sch\u00e4uble over Europe\u2019s approach to growth and austerity. The Greek PM wants more help; Germany\u2019s finance minister wants more competitiveness. Elsewhere in Davos... US Treasury secretary Jack Lew has hinted that markets have over-reacted to the oil price slump and China\u2019s slowdown. The chief economist of Brazil\u2019s biggest bank has warned its economic woes could last until 2018 A top Chinese official has defended Beijing\u2019s handling of the crisis.... ...after Christine Lagarde said China has a communication problem. The boss of HSBC has warned that it is hard to raise money for green energy right now The European Central Bank has kept its interest rates unchanged, as expected. After December\u2019s cut, it has left the deposit rate at -0.3%. Its benchmark refinancing rate is steady at 0.05%. The euro has inched up to $1.0915 following the news. Now for ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference, due shortly. Italy hopes to agree a plan with the EU to help its struggling banks by next week at the latest, Reuters is reporting. The report says the idea is to set up vehicles to help banks sell bad loans, with a disposal price equivalent to between 20% and 30% of the nominal value of the loan. The latest proposal submitted by Italy is being discussed with a technical meeting due on Friday. Yesterday, there were reports that some customers were withdrawing savings from Monte Paschi bank, with its chief executive saying said the fall in deposits was \u201climited\u201d and that the bank could cope with it.. Jack Lew managed to crack a joke; things can\u2019t be that bad. The US Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, is discussing the state of the US economy, and the wider globe. Lew begins by warning that the world economy isn\u2019t strong enough: I look around the world and there are a lot of headwinds. We\u2019ve seen very slugging growth in demand for some years now, and that\u2019s led to a not-strong-enough global economy. And now that things are developing in parts of the global economy that are disruptive, people are reacting to it. And he argues that people are being too negative over recent developments, such as the slump in crude oil. For anyone consuming oil, lower oil is a tax cut. And on China, Lew says the situation isn\u2019t dramatically different than last year. They are in a long and difficult transition, from an export-driven economy to a consumer one. That\u2019s a tough and disruptive process. The big issue in China is whether it can stick to its own economic reform plan, and deliver the growth that it, and the world economy, needs. He said it was important to see how China handled its currency - which was deprecated last summer - and called for \u201can orderly transition\u201d with the exchange rate, and for the Chinese to allow industrial capacity to \u201cright size. \u201cThese are big ifs\u201d, Lew said. And Lew also hints that investors may be getting too jumpy. I know it\u2019s been bumpy days in the market, but I try to look beyond the hour to hour, day to day, to what the big trends are. I\u2019m not minimising that it\u2019s been choppy in the markets, but I think you do need to look at some of these underlying trends in a long-term way. Ilan Goldfajn, chief economist at Brazil\u2019s biggest bank, Ita\u00fa Unibanco, says that his country\u2019s economic malaise is unlikely to be tackled until 2018. Goldfajn warned that : \u201cBrazil has a fiscal problem, it has an external problem and it has a political problem.\u201d The impeachment proceedings against Brazil\u2019s president Dilma Rousseff meant there had \u201cbeen a lame duck government from day one\u201d. Congress was blocking any attempts to resolve Brazil\u2019s economic problems, in part caused by the collapse in commodity prices and in part by mismanagement. Every country in South America had seen its growth rate halved since the end of the commodity super-cycle, Goldfajn said, but Brazil had done much worse than that. It had gone from growth of 4% a year to contraction of 4% a year. The political impasse would last until the next presidential election in 2018, he fears, saying: \u201cThe most likely scenario is that the economic problems are not going to be resolved until then. The economy will eventually not be in recession but there won\u2019t be a recovery either.\u201d Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, warned Davos that Brexit would be disastrous for all involved: BP\u2019s chief executive Bob Dudley says the current situation in the oil market reminds him of the 1986 crisis, where oversupply led to a collapse in prices, reports Reuters. Speaking in Davos, Dudley said he expected further pressure on prices this year as Iran ramped up exports: The first and second quarter will be very difficult....It is a big shock for producing countries. It reminds me of 1986. Prices will remain low for longer but not forever. He said markets would begin to rebalance later in 2016 as the glut of oil reduces and investment falls. Brent crude is currently down 0.4% at $27.76 a barrel. Manuel Valls has also told reporters here that he doesn\u2019t think David Cameron will agree a renegotiation deal next month: French PM Manual Valls says it would be a \u201ctragedy for Europe\u201d if the UK quit the Union. He tells Davos that David Cameron is making some good points, and that a more simple and effective Europe would be good for everyone. We must find a compromise, and everyone must contribute to it. Our British friends must understand we will move forwards hand in hand, together, Valls continues. And he warns that the sight of Britain going it alone, at a time when countries need to work more closely to tackle the world\u2019s problems, would be disastrous: Nothing would be worse than to see a country like UK leave, it would lead to more populism. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has told Davos that Europe \u201cneeds\u201d the United Kingdom to stay within the European Union. He also called on business and community leaders at Davos to campaign for the In side in the upcoming referendum, echoing David Cameron\u2019s speech this afternoon. Rutte says: The UK is outward looking , trade oriented, growth oriented, and we do not have enough of that storyline, that tradition, that culture within the European Union. The European Union can only survive if it is relevant to its people, and it can only be relevant if it leads to economic growth, more jobs and prosperity. It is also crucial for the UK to not lose its place in Europe: I believe the United Kingdom will be worse off outside the EU. It will not have the influence it has in the world today.... Isn\u2019t it strange to even debate a Brexit at a time the world is facing all these huge issues and challenges? Rutte goes on to call Cameron \u201cinfluential\u201d and an \u201cexcellent prime minister\u201d. We would all be worse off if he left, so all 28 countries must work together to create an EU that is more competitive, more outwardd-looking, more growth-oriented. If we could achieve that, the whole episide will have a positive ending Are you optimistic about the upcoming summit? Rutte says he is fairly optimistic that leaders could get to an postiive outcome in February, but not certain. He\u2019s also fairly optimistic about the referendum, and urges Davos attendees to speak out. I hope that all of you, business leaders, community leaders, with influence in the United Kingdom will participate. Don\u2019t leave it all to the politicians. You should not preach, as that will never work, but to explain to the British public why it is important in your view for the UK to be part of the European Union. Music to David Cameron\u2019s ears, I expect, as he tours Davos today. Asked about the IMF\u2019s role in the Greek bailout, Sch\u00e4uble appears to admit that he was over-ruled by chancellor Merkel: And the German parliament approved the 3rd bailout on those terms: Sch\u00e4uble responds to Tsipras, saying he does agree that Europe should help countries who need it. But Europe also need to be competitive. Germany has its own problems, including demographic (its ageing population). If we want to make Europe stronger, then we should implement what we agreed to implement. We could just say implementation, stupid. Back to Alexis Tsipras. He says Greece has made great efforts to reform its economy in recent years, through an unprecedented downturn. We lost 25% of our GDP, and unemployment skyrocketed, says the Greek PM. Tsipras then inplicitly criticises Europe\u2019s approach to Greece, saying: Greece needs considerable structural reforms. We must all understand that next to balanced budget, we also have to have growth. Greece needs to tackle corruption, boost investment, and help the state to rebuild itself. And he demands more solidarity, saying: We need a co-ordinated growth strategy, and Europe must help to diminish the inequalities between North and South. We need more Europe, and show more solidarity as well. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble refuses to say whether Germany can cope with another million refugees this year. And he says Europe must spend billions on the areas where refugees are fleeing. He agrees with Alexis Tsipras that Europe cannot become a fortress This problem will cost the European public more than expected, But it cannot be ignored. Sch\u00e4uble says, if Europe is to guarantee its security. It is a problem of and for Europe. Everything that goes wrong with these regions won\u2019t end up in Canada, it will end up in Europe. Alexis Tsipras says all European countries must share the burden of the refugee crisis. Europe must create a two-way system for migration, so people can be returned home. He also calls for much more co-operations between countries; Greece simply cannot cope alone. Next question, on migration, goes to Dutch PM Mark Rutte. Can the Schengen Agreement survive the refugee crisis? Rutte says that 35,000 people have already arrived on the shores of Europe this year. When spring comes, and the numbers quadruple, we cannot as a European Union cannot cope with the numbers any longer. This is the immediate agenda for the next few months. And the priorities include: Success of EU-Turkish union Successful hotspots in Greece and Turkey and Italy Schengen is crucial, Rutte continues. But we also have the Dublin agreement, and it isn\u2019t working. Before we kill Schengen, we have to make Dublin work.... No-one wants to kill Schengen, but if it is only a fair-weather system then it cannot survive. Manuel Valls, France\u2019s prime minister, kicks off the European session by saying security and terrorism are one of the biggest challenges faced by the continent. We are at war against terrorism. A world war. And we as Europeans need to face up to this. And European must work together to fight it, pooling resources, and also sharing more information - including a common programme of oversight of flights and airports. So could EU forces be deployed to hot spots in the Middle East? We need more Europe, not less, says Valls, as he thanks everyone who offered help and support to France after the Paris terror attacks. The Middle East is just two hours from Europe - we cannot ignore what is going on there. We must move away from this selfishness, and find the means to deal with this historic challenge. Hundreds of people are pouring into the Davos Congress Hall for the main set-piece event of the morning - the Future of Europe session. It will pit Greece\u2019s Alexis Tsipras against Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Schauble, with France\u2019s Manual Valls, the Netherland\u2019s Mark Rutte, and Eni chairman Emma Marcegaglia. You can watch it live, here: Perhaps we spoke too soon. The attempted rally in Europe seems to be petering out, with the FTSE down around 8 points and Germany\u2019s Dax off 24 points. Dow futures are also falling, now indicating a 130 point decline at the opening bell. David Morrison at Spread Co said: Equities are on the slide again as crude oil continues its relentless decline. Both WTI and Brent are trading below $28 for the usual supply/demand reasons. However, there are also concerns as speculation mounts over the possibility that Saudi Arabia may unpeg the riyal from the US dollar. The strength of the greenback combined with the low oil price is a serious drain on the Kingdom\u2019s reserves and breaking the peg would be one way of easing the pain. Looks like another topsy-turvey day. Here\u2019s our report on today\u2019s session on the Chinese economy: A senior Chinese official has defended the country\u2019s economic policies and urged investors to stop fixation on fluctuations in its stock market. Fang Xinghai, Office of the central leading group for financial and economic affairs, told the World Economic Forum that while the stock market was down 40% from its peak it was up 30% over 18 months, He also insisted that there was no basis on which to devalue the currency and said the country was commitment to moving to shadowing a basket of currencies. He declared: \u201cChina\u2019s record of honouring itss commitment is superb\u201d. He is speaking against a backdrop of countries concerned about the Chinese economy, its currency - which was devalued during the summer - and the volatility in its stock market. Gary Cohn, chief operating officer of Goldman, said most market participants believed China would devalue its currency this year. He joined Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, in calling for better communication over its polices. Lagarde said: Given the massive transitions in China, there is a communication issue - this is something that markets do not like. Uncertainty, not knowing exactly what the policy is. Not knowing exactly what the renmimni is valued against - the dollar, or a basket of currencies. Better and more communication\u201d would serve the country better, she said. Gary Cohn, chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, agreed with Lagarde and urged the Chinese to stick its polices once they have been communicated. Fang Xinghai has also told Davos that there is need for more co-operation with global policymakers around the world,\u201dWe have to cooperate more closely to overcome this soft patch,\u201d Fang said. Taken to task by Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associations about what this co-operation meant, Fang said it meant in all areas. More on the ECB ahead of today\u2019s meeting: Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, has weighed in on the Brexit question, arguing Britain should stay in Europe: Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, is reported to have pulled out of Davos to deal with the problems in the Italian banking sector: Yesterday, there were reports that customers were pulling funds out of the Monti Paschi bank, on concerns over its bad debts. European markets are holding onto their early gains, while US futures are suggesting a dip of around 45 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average when Wall Street opens. David Morrison at trading company Spread Co said: The reaction to the overnight Asian Pacific slump from European equities and US stock index futures has been surprisingly muted. At the time of writing, all the major indices are in positive territory. On the face of it this is quite encouraging, particularly as crude is still trading near its 2003 lows. But once again, what looks like the beginning of a recovery in equities could easily turn out to be nothing more than a \u201cdead-cat bounce.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt there have been signs of stress in global equities for a while now. As far as the US is concerned, in the latter half of 2015 the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (Alphabet)) were responsible for holding up the major indices as the broader market declined. Technically, the major indices formed a topping pattern as they failed to make fresh highs after the China-inspired summer sell-off. Stress in the high yield bond market was becoming apparent even before the Fed hiked rates. That hike now looks as if it will go down as one of the worst-timed rate rises in history, even crowning the ECB\u2019s classic efforts in 2011. To top it all, China suffered a second melt-down just as we began the New Year. The Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has admitted that Europe blundered by not dealing with its banks faster. A group of demonstrators have been spotted in Davos. They\u2019re protesting against China\u2019s activities in the Pakistani territory of Balochistan, where Beijing is developing a large new economic zone. Rough translation: Protests in Davos are not so large now. And that\u2019s because of the huge security presence in this ski resort, which clamps down on any signs of dissent. Top Chinese official Fang Xinghai has hit back at Christine Lagarde\u2019s complaint about communications failings (see earlier post) Fang is the vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and a senio advisor to the premier Li Keqiang. With markets in turmoil, oil sliding to new lows, concerns about Chinese growth and worries about whether central bankers have run out of ammunition to support the global economy, the president of the European Central Bank will be on the spot later to spell out where he thinks we go from here. Mario Draghi will unveil the ECB\u2019s latest measures - more QE? Perhaps not yet - in a statement and press conference in Frankfurt. After last month, when the measures announced proved a disappointment, and the more hawkish elements on the ECB clearly prevented the bank from doing more, Draghi\u2019s comments will be widely watched. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Today\u2019s focus is likely to shine on the first ECB rate meeting of 2016, against a continuing backdrop of weak inflation in the euro area. With last month\u2019s December disappointment still fresh in the memory ECB President Mario Draghi will have to convince the markets that the ECB has a plan, and the ammunition to cope with the further slide in inflationary pressures that are likely to ripple across Europe in the coming weeks. It is clear that the hawks won out last month preventing the ECB from acting in a much stronger fashion, and in the process giving the ECB President a bloody nose, after he had indicated the prospect of much stronger action. How Mr Draghi navigates these divisions will be particularly pertinent given how they were revealed in the most recent minutes, especially given that the next projections in March are likely to see inflation expectations guided lower. This is because since last month\u2019s December meeting oil prices have slid another 35%, which means that while the ECB President might come across as dovish later today, after last month\u2019s disappointment markets may not necessarily take him at his word. Economists at Unicredit said: ECB president Mario Draghi will likely sound dovish today, but we expect him to strike a reasonable balance. Mr. Draghi will be careful to avoid fuelling too much speculation about further action to avoid a repetition of the December experience, when the announcement of QE2 fell short of high expectations. At the time, the market\u2019s disappointed reaction resulted in a 3% rally in euro-dollar exchange rate. Today, we do not expect the meeting to cause any major move in exchange rates, as the market seems prepared for a relatively balanced debate. The euro has held up well since the 3 December meeting, and it would take a strong (unexpected) dovish signal of imminent action to change this pattern. Mic Mills at Capital Index said: All eyes today will be on the ECB with the interest rate decision at 12:45 [GMT] followed by Draghi giving the post meeting press conference at 13:30, which after last month will need to persuade the markets that there is more in the cupboard, as there seems to be no respite in sight when it comes to deflationary pressure. FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga said: For an extended period falling commodity prices have left the Eurozone engaged in an ongoing one-sided battle against stubbornly low inflation levels, while stalling domestic economic growth continues to test the European Central Bank\u2019s credibility. It is widely expected that the ECB will remain on standby today and keep rates unchanged, but Mario Draghi may reiterate his dovish mantra and threaten further QE in an attempt to talk down the value of the Euro. At an HSBC breakfast on climate change, the bank\u2019s chief executive Stuart Gulliver has said the current state of the financial markets is not exactly conducive to raising private funds to tackle global warming. \u201cThe markets are showing signs of quite significant distress and it is not a high priority for fund managers to set up a green fund\u201d, Gulliver says. He also says that the crash in oil prices may have the \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of deterring investment in alternative energy sources because the R&amp;D costs will be considered too high. Gulliver says that following the Paris climate change conference governments and the private sector had to raise $5tn a year over the next two decades. \u201cIt is a vast financing challenge\u201d, he says. Despite the falls in Asia, European markets have made a positive start, if not a totally convincing one. The FTSE 100 is up 31 points or 0.5%, while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.1%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is 0.5% better and Spain\u2019s Ibex has added 0.5%. Germany\u2019s Dax, despite Deutsche Bank saying it expected to report a record loss of \u20ac6.7bn for 2015, is ahead by 0.2%. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has warned that Beijing needs to improve the way it communicates with the markets. Currently, investors are being spooked as they watch China embark on a huge economic rebalancing. She tells today\u2019s discussion on China that: Given the massive transitions in China, there is a communication issue - this is something that markets do not like. Uncertainty, not knowing exactly what the policy is. Not knowing exactly what the renmimni is valued against - the dollar, or a basket of currencies. China\u2019s rebalancing is \u201cperfectly manageable\u201d if the right policies are taken, she adds. Ji\u0101ng Ji\u00e0nq\u012bng, the Chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, has argued that China can\u2019t be blamed for the stock market turmoil. Speaking on a panel in China\u2019s economy, Ji\u00e0nq\u012bng said a range of factors are being it. He cites the slow pace of recovery in the world economy, meaning growth is flat. The US interest rate hike, and economic policies in the EU have also created volatility. And commodity prices are under pressure. So the world all over is facing volatility. Some reasons are normal, some are abnormal. There is a certain degree of panic in the market. Policymakers must implement structural reforms to lead the world economy out of this period of low growth, and regulators should work together to reduce volatility. European markets are expected to make an uncertain start after Wednesday\u2019s rout, which saw the FTSE 100 head into bear market territory. A recovery on the Dow Jones Industrial Average from its worst levels \u2013 albeit still showing a 249 point fall \u2013 may give some support, although Asian markets lost their early gains to head into the red again. Here are the opening calls in Europe: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Now that equity markets, both here in Europe and in the US have slipped into bear market territory the big question now is where do we go to next. That looks highly likely to depend on oil prices and a late rebound off the lows yesterday did see US markets recoup a large portion of their losses, the Dow was 566 points down at one stage, but they still finished the day below their previous lows in August. This late rebound should be enough to see European markets open higher this morning, a welcome respite after yesterday\u2019s sell-off, but it is going to need a significant turnaround in sentiment to recoup the losses seen so far this week, and prevent markets from posting their third successive weekly decline. Oil in fact is slipping back again, with Brent crude down 1% at $27.58 a barrel. David Cameron is to call on the UK\u2019s business chiefs to support him in the upcoming EU referendum to secure Britain\u2019s place in a reformed EU. The prime minister is using his trip to Davos to drum up support, ahead of a potentially decisive EU summit in February where he could secure concessions from fellow European leaders. The PM is expected to say that: \u201cThis is a once-in-a-generation moment and the stakes are high.\u201d Cameron\u2019s message to business chiefs is that if they want Britain to remain in the EU with less red tape and a more complete single market, they need to come out and back the In Campaign. He\u2019ll say: If you want a more competitive Europe, where the single market is completed, where there are more trade deals and fewer regulations: join me in making that case. \u201cIf you believe, like I do, that Britain is better off in a reformed European Union, then, when the time comes, help me make that case for Britain to stay.\u201d Business leaders in Davos have been very unwilling to talk on the record about the Brexit issue, while many international delegates have sounded more worried about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU. So Cameron will certainly be in demand today, as he holds a series of \u2018bilateral\u2019 meetings. Good morning from Davos, where the second day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. Yesterday\u2019s stock market plunges have sent a shiver through this little ski resort, as the \u201cglobal elite\u201d gather to debate the major issues of the moment. And world leaders and business chiefs will be monitoring events in the markets closely again, following a wild day\u2019s trading in Asia overnight. Today\u2019s session will be dominated by Europe, with prime minister David Cameron giving a big set-piece speech in the afternoon. Cameron is also due to meet with Argentina\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, in what could be a thawing of relations between the two countries. Greece is also in focus today, as prime minister Alexis Tsipras tries to lobby creditor nations to cut Athens some slack on austerity and debt relief. He\u2019s expected to meet with Christine Lagarde during the day. And there\u2019s also a big focus on geopolitics, with the migration crisis and the turmoil in the Middle East. Some sessions which we\u2019ll try to cover include: 8.45am CET (7.45am GMT): Where is the Chinese economy headed? Including IMF chief Christine Lagarde 10.15am CET A debate on the future of Europe, including French PM Manuel Valls, Greek PM Alexis Tsipras, Dutch PM Mark Rutte and German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble 12.30pm CET: Treasury secretary Jack Lew discusses \u201cglobal financial priorities in 2016.\u201d 2pm CET: David Cameron on Britain\u2019s place in the world 3pm: How to educate Syria\u2019s displaced children",

At the time of writing, all the major indices are in positive territory. On the face of it this is quite encouraging, particularly as crude is still trading near its 2003 lows. But once again, what looks like the beginning of a recovery in equities could easily turn out to be nothing more than a \u201cdead-cat bounce.\u201d </p> <p>There\u2019s no doubt there have been signs of stress in global equities for a while now. As far as the US is concerned, in the latter half of 2015 the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (Alphabet)) were responsible for holding up the major indices as the broader market declined. Technically, the major indices formed a topping pattern as they failed to make fresh highs after the China-inspired summer sell-off. Stress in the high yield bond market was becoming apparent even before the Fed hiked rates. That hike now looks as if it will go down as one of the worst-timed rate rises in history, even crowning the ECB\u2019s classic efforts in 2011. To top it all, China suffered a second melt-down just as we began the New Year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a09a2de4b08d8673c97368\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-21T08:45:17.336Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has admitted that Europe blundered by not dealing with its banks faster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/carmelcrimmins/statuses/690089322658267137\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Davos\">@Davos</a> Dijsselbloem says Europe was &quot;foolish&quot; to leave it so late to deal with its banks <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WEF16?src=hash\">#WEF16</a></p>&mdash; Carmel Crimmins (@carmelcrimmins) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carmelcrimmins/status/690089322658267137\">January 21, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GiovanniBossi/statuses/690089156509351936\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Davos2016?src=hash\">#Davos2016</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wef\">@wef</a> &quot;Future-proofing finance&quot; Dijsselbloem, &quot;we need a capital market where risks are well priced&quot;.

Perhaps not yet - in a statement and press conference in Frankfurt. After last month, when the measures announced proved a disappointment, and the more hawkish elements on the ECB clearly prevented the bank from doing more, Draghi\u2019s comments will be widely watched. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s focus is likely to shine on the first ECB rate meeting of 2016, against a continuing backdrop of weak inflation in the euro area.</p> <p>With last month\u2019s December disappointment still fresh in the memory ECB President Mario Draghi will have to convince the markets that the ECB has a plan, and the ammunition to cope with the further slide in inflationary pressures that are likely to ripple across Europe in the coming weeks.</p> <p>It is clear that the hawks won out last month preventing the ECB from acting in a much stronger fashion, and in the process giving the ECB President a bloody nose, after he had indicated the prospect of much stronger action. How Mr Draghi navigates these divisions will be particularly pertinent given how they were revealed in the most recent minutes, especially given that the next projections in March are likely to see inflation expectations guided lower.</p> <p>This is because since last month\u2019s December meeting oil prices have slid another 35%, which means that while the ECB President might come across as dovish later today, after last month\u2019s disappointment markets may not necessarily take him at his word.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2494b2fe927581f6e47d8b56b40c51998ee852c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2494b2fe927581f6e47d8b56b40c51998ee852c/0_0_3252_1951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ECB President Draghi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ECB President Draghi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Economists at Unicredit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>ECB president Mario Draghi will likely sound dovish today, but we expect him to strike a reasonable balance. Mr. Draghi will be careful to avoid fuelling too much speculation about further action to avoid a repetition of the December experience, when the announcement of QE2 fell short of high expectations.</p> <p>At the time, the market\u2019s disappointed reaction resulted in a 3% rally in euro-dollar exchange rate. Today, we do not expect the meeting to cause any major move in exchange rates, as the market seems prepared for a relatively balanced debate. The euro has held up well since the 3 December meeting, and it would take a strong (unexpected) dovish signal of imminent action to change this pattern.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mic Mills at Capital Index said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All eyes today will be on the ECB with the interest rate decision at 12:45 [GMT] followed by Draghi giving the post meeting press conference at 13:30, which after last month will need to persuade the markets that there is more in the cupboard, as there seems to be no respite in sight when it comes to deflationary pressure.</p> </blockquote> <p>FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For an extended period falling commodity prices have left the Eurozone engaged in an ongoing one-sided battle against stubbornly low inflation levels, while stalling domestic economic growth continues to test the European Central Bank\u2019s credibility. It is widely expected that the ECB will remain on standby today and keep rates unchanged, but Mario Draghi may reiterate his dovish mantra and threaten further QE in an attempt to talk down the value of the Euro.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d6da6384bd05914d2eb086e464d9e446b2bf2e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d6da6384bd05914d2eb086e464d9e446b2bf2e5/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ECB rate and QE decision due.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ECB rate and QE decision due.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-01-21T08:58:02.662Z\">at 8.58am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56a091ebe4b08d8673c97361\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/larryelliott\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-21T08:11:36.547Z\">8.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">HSBC boss warns over green financing</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"60c1e45493bfa16c021d9905dee6f6ef601ed854\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60c1e45493bfa16c021d9905dee6f6ef601ed854/0_0_3000_2037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gulliver looks on at a panel discussion during the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong<br>Stuart T Gulliver, Group Chief Executive of HSBC Holdings plc, looks on at a panel discussion during the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong, China January 18, 2016.

      "bodyText": "Here comes Wall Street, answering David Cameron\u2019s call for the voice of business to be \u201cheard in Britain and across the whole continent\u201d. Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan, suggests his bank would quit the UK if Britain exits the European Union. \u201cBritain\u2019s been a great home for financial companies and it\u2019s benefited London quite a bit. We\u2019d like to stay there but if we can\u2019t, we can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cCan we have that in writing?\u201d some UK voters may respond. Overpaid investment bankers, especially Wall Street types, are not held in high general esteem in the UK. Vague threats to leave the country will be viewed in many quarters as arrogant and may well be counterproductive for the Remain camp. If Dimon really wants to contribute to the debate \u2013 as opposed to throwing out one-liners \u2013 he should study how UK financial institutions behaved during the Scottish referendum. The likes of Standard Life and Royal Bank of Scotland avoided ambiguity and instead described the changes they would make to their businesses if voters chose independence. In RBS\u2019s case, its actions would have amounted to little more than taking the registered office south of the border without moving jobs and operations. Is Dimon saying JP Morgan\u2019s departure from the UK would be automatic, with 19,000 jobs moving to Paris, Frankfurt or wherever? Would the bank make its decision only after seeing the terms of a negotiated exit? Or would it hedge its bets in case, as some argue, the City overcomes any short-term loss of business with the EU by expanding trade with emerging markets? There are big differences between the three positions. If JP Morgan has conducted a proper analysis of its options, let\u2019s hear the details rather than airy soundbites. The same applies to other companies. Chief executives are entitled to give their personal opinions on EU membership, but the interesting material \u2013 and the stuff that may sway opinions \u2013 is what Brexit would mean for how companies are managed and where they would invest. That needs to be supported by robust analysis. Shareholders, too, deserve more than glib remarks. If the EU referendum poses the most important question the UK will answer for a generation, it would be useful to know which boards have plans to deal with the potential direct consequences for their companies. \u201cWe\u2019re off, maybe,\u201d doesn\u2019t do the job. Grim reading for Pearson Two years ago, John Fallon, Pearson\u2019s chief executive, said the educational publisher was in the middle of \u201ca short but difficult transition\u201d. Short has become long and difficult has become very difficult. About 4,000 jobs, 10% of the workforce, will be axed, creating a \u00a3320m restructuring bill. Was Fallon just too timid the first time? The way he tells it, certain \u201ccyclical\u201d factors have lasted longer than expected and thus more is required. But don\u2019t worry, this time Pearson really is confident that its markets will come good. Fifty years of data, apparently, show that when US employment stabilises, enrolments in colleges rise at 1%-1.5% a year, which in theory will generate extra demand for Pearson\u2019s textbooks and learning materials. Throw in the restructuring savings of \u00a3350m and Pearson will be making \u00a3800m of operating profits by 2018, versus \u00a3600m-ish expected for this year, Fallon says. While shareholders await those sunny uplands, they can enjoy a steady dividend of 52p even though it would barely be covered by pre-restructuring earnings this year, even if things go well. The cushion is the proceeds from selling the Financial Times and the 50% stake in the Economist. That\u2019s the theory, and the markets lapped it up \u2013 shares rose by 17%. The celebration looks highly premature. When managements grumble that cycles are taking longer to turn than they expected, it often means their markets have changed permanently for the worse. Maybe US states are finding ways to squeeze their education budgets harder; maybe, in the digital age, students prefer to rent vital textbooks and won\u2019t pay the old prices. You can\u2019t blame Fallon for adopting a one-last-heave approach, but the evidence of the past two years suggests Pearson\u2019s markets can change faster than the company. That dividend, offering a 6.7% yield, doesn\u2019t look safe yet. Another look at HBOS \u201cThis is not before time,\u201d said Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the Treasury select committee, dryly. You bet. Seven years after the collapse of HBOS, the Financial Reporting Council will take a look at KPMG\u2019s audit of the failed bank\u2019s accounts for 2007, specifically the use of \u201cgoing concern\u201d provisions. This is only a preliminary investigation, but thank heavens something is happening. The FRC resents suggestions of foot-dragging, arguing that new material in the official regulatory report on HBOS, published in November, has prompted the fresh look. Well, OK, but November was two months ago, and Tyrie and others have been screaming for the FRC to wake up ever since. Get a move on, chaps.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer, the UK\u2019s biggest clothing retailer by value and which sells one in every four pairs of knickers bought in Britain, has launched new websites in Australia and New Zealand in the British retailer\u2019s latest attempt to expand overseas. Australian shoppers are already among M&amp;S\u2019s biggest online spenders, buying via the retailer\u2019s UK website which delivers to more than 30 countries worldwide. The new, dedicated sites for Australia and New Zealand feature local currency and sizing and have tailored editorial content highlighting items relevant to the local seasons. David Walmsley, director of M&amp;S.com, said: \u201cAustralia is firmly established as one of our top performing international delivery markets and our new localised website presents a key growth opportunity for our international online business.\u201d The website launch in Australia will be supported with an ad campaign using the tagline \u201cBritish style for Australian life\u201d. M&amp;S has long been rumoured to be planning a high street store in Australia, and the new website is only likely to fuel those expectations. But a spokesperson for M&amp;S said: \u201cWhile we always look at new opportunities, we have no current plans to open stores in Australia.\u201d International expansion has been a key part of a turnaround plan put in place by M&amp;S\u2019s chief executive, Marc Bolland, who is to leave the business in the spring. He launched the company\u2019s first dedicated overseas website in France in 2011 and that was soon followed by stores. M&amp;S now has dedicated websites in nine international markets including Germany, Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The Australian and New Zealand sites are its first dedicated websites outside Europe. But M&amp;S already sells online in China via the Tmall marketplace and in India via the Myntra and Flipkart sites. Overseas expansion has proved trickier than expected. International profits halved in the first half of this year as a result of exchange rate headwinds in Europe as well as economic and political issues in Russia and Ukraine. In 2014, M&amp;S said it had hoped to open 250 international stores over three years, but last year it said those plans amid the civil war in Ukraine and an economic slowdown in China, where M&amp;S has closed stores.",

    "webTitle": "IMF demands EU debt relief for Greece before new bailout", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Union will need to provide significant debt relief for Greece if it is to persuade the International Monetary Fund to put its financial clout behind the country\u2019s third bailout package, the Washington-based organisation has said. After what was described as a cordial meeting between the IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, and the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, the fund said it was only prepared to support the recession-ravaged eurozone country on a strings-attached basis. It said Greece had to be prepared to implement a tough package of economic reform and the country\u2019s eurozone partners had to be willing to write down Greece\u2019s debts. The IMF took part in the first two Greek bailouts but is concerned that, at 175% of GDP, Greece\u2019s debts are too burdensome and will prevent a lasting recovery. Lagarde told Tsipras the IMF regarded reform of Greece\u2019s pension system, which accounts for 17.7% of GDP, as vital. The IMF said of the talks: \u201cThe managing director reiterated that the IMF stands ready to continue to support Greece in achieving robust economic growth and sustainable public finances through a credible and comprehensive medium-term economic programme. \u201cSuch a programme would require strong economic policies, not least pension reforms as well as significant debt relief from Greece\u2019s European partners to ensure that debt is on a sustainable downward trajectory.\u201d The Greek government said the talks had been sincere. Earlier in the day, Tsipras told Davos he was committed to reforming the Greek economy, which lost 25% of its GDP through austerity programmes which sent jobless rates to twice the eurozone average. But he criticised Europe\u2019s insistence on lowering budget deficits, saying: \u201cWe must all understand that, next to balanced budgets, we must also have growth \u2026 We need to be more realistic, and show more solidarity too.\u201d The German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, appeared unimpressed by Tsipras\u2019s call for greater solidarity, and suggested he needed to deliver on the promises made to creditors. \u201cMy advice is, if we want to make Europe stronger we should implement what we agreed to implement. We can simply say, \u2018implementation, stupid\u2019,\u201d Sch\u00e4uble said, in a dig at the Greek leader echoing the catchphrase from Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 US election campaign. The scale of the challenge facing Tsipras was clear in Athens on Thursday. As he rubbed shoulders with fellow world leaders in the Swiss ski resort, thousands of protesters marched through the Greek capital to oppose pension reforms. Many were professionals, such as doctors and engineers, adding their voices to existing protests by farmers and fishermen. Lagarde had earlier called on China to take action to halt the turbulence in financial markets by providing clearer communication about its strategy of reform. Sidestepping questions about whether she wanted a second term at the IMF, she said: \u201cGiven the massive transitions in China, there is a communication issue \u2013 this is something that markets do not like. \u201cUncertainty, not knowing exactly what the policy is. Not knowing exactly what the renmimni is valued against \u2013 the dollar, or a basket of currencies.\u201d Chinese delegates repeatedly insisted they were not losing control of the economy, growth of which has slowed to 6.8% in the last quarter, its slowest pace in 25 years.

Lagarde told Tsipras the IMF regarded reform of Greece\u2019s pension system, which accounts for 17.7% of GDP, as vital.</p> <p>The IMF said of the talks: \u201cThe managing director reiterated that the IMF stands ready to continue to support Greece in achieving robust economic growth and sustainable public finances through a credible and comprehensive medium-term economic programme.</p> <p>\u201cSuch a programme would require strong economic policies, not least pension reforms as well as significant debt relief from Greece\u2019s European partners to ensure that debt is on a sustainable downward trajectory.\u201d <br></p> <p>The Greek government said the talks had been sincere.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Tsipras told Davos he was committed to reforming the Greek economy, which lost 25% of its GDP through austerity programmes which sent jobless rates to twice the eurozone average. But he criticised Europe\u2019s insistence on lowering budget deficits, saying: \u201cWe must all understand that, next to balanced budgets, we must also have growth \u2026 We need to be more realistic, and show more solidarity too.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/jan/21/international-monetary-fund-cuts-growth-forecasts-for-next-two-years-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4g2cy\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2442495\"            data-video-name=\"International Monetary Fund cuts growth forecasts for next two years \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/1/21/1453350637075/BK_2967_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56a05ef1e4b0c28fe0ef0fed\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/1/21/1453350637075/BK_2967_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/01/21/160121economics_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10548593&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10548593&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10548593&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10548593&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/> </video> </figure>   <p>The German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, appeared unimpressed by Tsipras\u2019s call for greater solidarity, and suggested he needed to deliver on the promises made to creditors. \u201cMy advice is, if we want to make Europe stronger we should implement what we agreed to implement.

      "bodyText": "David Cameron has been told by the British Chambers of Commerce that he should put fixing the domestic economy before glad-handing the international elite gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos. John Longworth warned the prime minister and the chancellor, George Osborne, that they were at risk of taking their eye off the ball and should put their focus on protecting the UK economy from the crisis in the financial markets that risks threatening business confidence. \u201cBig summits like Davos have their place, but they don\u2019t change the growth prospects for businesses back home,\u201d Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, wrote on theguardian.com. Cameron delivered a set-piece speech to the delegates in Davos on Thursday while Osborne is scheduled to hold his traditional lunch with business leaders from the UK on Friday and speak on a panel on Saturday. Longworth warned that global events and stock market jitters \u2013 global stock markets have had their worse ever start to a year amid fears of a repeat of the 2008 crisis \u2013 were threatening to undermine business confidence. Uncertainty about interest rates \u2013 with the US raising rates and the UK pushing back the date on the first rise since 2007 \u2013 were also a concern. \u201cBritish firms are at a crossroads. After a period of sustained growth, we need a renewed focus on fixing the fundamentals to create a business environment that supports continued expansion. What happens at Davos is ultimately far less important than the tough choices that remain unresolved back at home,\u201d said Longworth. \u201cSo while our politicians mix with celebrities and global CEOs, discussing matters such as the refugee crisis and climate change, it is imperative that the UK government does not get distracted from the more mundane, but no less critical, issues that threaten business success,\u201d said Longworth, who is not in Davos. \u201cThe PM and chancellor need to come back from Davos and focus on how both global and domestic factors are impacting the prospects for the multitude of businesses who make up the economy,\u201d he added. Longworth has a shopping list of reforms that the BCC would like the government to implement. He listed a relaxation of tax and compliance burdens on UK firms, reforms to \u201coutdated and cumbersome\u201d business rates and improving access to finance. He also criticised the delays over Heathrow\u2019s third runway. \u201cThe delay over a decision on airport expansion is a prime example of how politics has been put before what\u2019s best for growth, leaving us in a situation where airport capacity has not matched growth in demand and is a drag on our economy,\u201d he said. Just before Christmas, the official estimate of GDP was revised down by the Office for National Statistics in a blow to Osborne. The official data had only shown growth in the three months to September was 0.5%, but this was being cut to 0.4%. The annual rise in GDP in the year to the end of September was reduced from 2.3% to 2.1%. Osborne warned earlier this month that the UK faced a \u201cdangerous cocktail of new risks\u201d and warned against a \u201ccreeping complacency\u201d that Britain was immune from the problems that have troubled global financial markets in the opening weeks of 2016.",

      "bodyText": "This week the great and the good have converged on Davos for the annual World Economic Forum. As they seek to divide and conquer the world between them, it is worth sparing a thought for businesses that are the backbone of the economy, fighting to grow and thrive. Amid an increasingly uncertain global outlook, a softening domestic economy and some disappointing policy decisions here at home, it is these bedrock businesses \u2013not just the global elite \u2013 who should be front of mind. Confidence is essential to economic growth. Low interest rates and stable governments over the last few years have helped to reassure both UK firms and external investors that it is safe to invest, take risks, and pursue new opportunities. However, global events and stock market jitters are threatening to undermine business confidence, with potentially far-reaching consequences. The divergent actions of major central banks \u2013 with the US Federal Reserve edging rates up and the European Central Bank reducing them \u2013 are likely to add to this uncertainty. So while our politicians mix with celebrities and global CEOs, discussing matters such as the refugee crisis and climate change, it is imperative that the UK government does not get distracted from the more mundane, but no less critical, issues that threaten business success. The PM and chancellor need to come back from Davos and focus on how both global and domestic factors are impacting the prospects for the multitude of businesses who make up the economy. British firms are at a crossroads. After a period of sustained growth, we need a renewed focus on fixing the fundamentals to create a business environment that supports continued expansion. What happens at Davos is ultimately far less important than the tough choices that remain unresolved back at home. The UK needs to see swift action from the government on infrastructure investment before a lack of capacity stifles business productivity. The delay over a decision on airport expansion is a prime example of how politics has been put before what\u2019s best for growth, leaving us in a situation where airport capacity has not matched growth in demand and is a drag on our economy. The government also needs to further reduce the tax and compliance burdens on UK firms. It is long past time to deliver on promised reform of the outdated and cumbersome business rates system, to enable firms to focus on the work at hand and to encourage re-investment in new staff and equipment. Improving access to non-equity capital is also vital to helping businesses to invest in growth and expanding their operations. We also face a growing skills gap exacerbated by the failure to adequately prepare young people for the workplace, causing businesses to look overseas in search of the skills they need. When it comes to confidence and investment the apprenticeship levy, pensions auto-enrolment and the national living wage are further adding to uncertainty and business costs, at a time when business needs to invest for our economy to thrive. Big summits like Davos have their place but they don\u2019t change the growth prospects for businesses back home. At the current time, our leaders cannot afford to take their eye off the ball. Too many politically difficult but important decisions have been put off for too long, and instead of looking to win international approval the PM and chancellor should concentrate on weatherproofing the UK economy before the storms hit.

      "body": "<p>This week the great and the good have converged on Davos for the annual World Economic Forum. As they seek to divide and conquer the world between them, it is worth sparing a thought for businesses that are the backbone of the economy, fighting to grow and thrive. </p> <p>Amid an increasingly uncertain global outlook, a softening domestic economy and some disappointing policy decisions here at home, it is these bedrock businesses \u2013not just the global elite \u2013 who should be front of mind. Confidence is essential to economic growth. Low interest rates and stable governments over the last few years have helped to reassure both UK firms and external investors that it is safe to invest, take risks, and pursue new opportunities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/21/david-cameron-told-to-put-fixing-uk-economy-ahead-of-networking-in-davos\">David Cameron told to put fixing UK economy ahead of networking in Davos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, global events and stock market jitters are threatening to undermine business confidence, with potentially far-reaching consequences. The divergent actions of major central banks \u2013 with the US Federal Reserve edging rates up and the European Central Bank reducing them \u2013 are likely to add to this uncertainty. So while our politicians mix with celebrities and global CEOs, discussing matters such as the refugee crisis and climate change, it is imperative that the UK government does not get distracted from the more mundane, but no less critical, issues that threaten business success.</p> <p>The PM and chancellor need to come back from Davos and focus on how both global and domestic factors are impacting the prospects for the multitude of businesses who make up the economy. British firms are at a crossroads. After a period of sustained growth, we need a renewed focus on fixing the fundamentals to create a business environment that supports continued expansion. What happens at Davos is ultimately far less important than the tough choices that remain unresolved back at home.</p> <p>The UK needs to see swift action from the government on infrastructure investment before a lack of capacity stifles business productivity. The delay over a decision on airport expansion is a prime example of how politics has been put before what\u2019s best for growth, leaving us in a situation where airport capacity has not matched growth in demand and is a drag on our economy.</p> <p>The government also needs to further reduce the tax and compliance burdens on UK firms. It is long past time to deliver on promised reform of the outdated and cumbersome business rates system, to enable firms to focus on the work at hand and to encourage re-investment in new staff and equipment. Improving access to non-equity capital is also vital to helping businesses to invest in growth and expanding their operations.</p> <p>We also face a growing skills gap exacerbated by the failure to adequately prepare young people for the workplace, causing businesses to look overseas in search of the skills they need. When it comes to confidence and investment the apprenticeship levy, pensions auto-enrolment and the national living wage are further adding to uncertainty and business costs, at a time when business needs to invest for our economy to thrive.</p> <p>Big summits like Davos have their place but they don\u2019t change the growth prospects for businesses back home. At the current time, our leaders cannot afford to take their eye off the ball. Too many politically difficult but important decisions have been put off for too long, and instead of looking to win international approval the PM and chancellor should concentrate on weatherproofing the UK economy before the storms hit.</p> <p><em>John Longworth is director general of the British Chambers of Commerce</em></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "VW has dismissed a call from the EU\u2019s industry chief to pay compensation to European drivers who bought cars with emissions test-cheating software. El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska, the European commissioner for industry, urged the German carmaker to pay compensation to 8.5 million European drivers who had bought cars fitted with defeat devices when she met VW\u2019s chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, in Brussels on Thursday. Bie\u0144kowska, a former deputy prime minister of Poland who oversees EU industry policy, is seeking to raise pressure on the German carmaker to pay compensation, although she has no formal powers to force payouts. In the US, where the scandal was uncovered, the group has agreed to pay $1,000 (\u00a3704) to 500,000 drivers. US owners of VW diesel cars with 2.0 engines will get $500 on a prepaid visa card and $500 in dealership credits, described by the company as a goodwill gesture, because it cannot yet remove the illegal software. In Europe, VW has promised to remove the device, but has no plans to pay compensation. The company argues it has done nothing illegal under EU law. In talks that were described as brief and open, the commissioner \u201cinvited the group once again to reflect on adequate ways to compensate consumers\u201d, a spokeswoman said. \u201cShe repeated her clear view that EU consumers should be treated in the same way as US customers.\u201d But officials admit they cannot force VW to pay out. \u201cThe scope for action by the commission is pretty much nil, so we can only send political messages,\u201d one said. A spokesman for VW in the UK said: \u201cWe don\u2019t see the case for compensation for two main reasons. One is that the vehicles are going to be fixed. There is no hindrance and people can continue to use their vehicles normally.\u201d The second reason, he said, is that the history of car recalls shows no reduction in resale value \u2013 disputing the argument that customers would lose out if they want to sell their cars. He added that VW cars sold in the US were \u201ctechnically different\u201d and had to pass stricter tests, while the company had not yet found a fix for the cars. \u201cFor all those reasons we decided to compensate US customers.\u201d VW\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg did not immediately respond to request for comment, but a group spokesman told the New York Times earlier this week that the company had not broken the law in Europe, because the devices installed in millions of cars were not \u201cforbidden\u201d under EU law. The scandal erupted last autumn when VW admitted that 11m of its cars were designed to cheat emissions tests. The company has set aside \u20ac6.5bn to deal with the crisis, although it could face fines of up to $18bn in the US as a result of a criminal investigation. The fallout has not only weighed on VW sales but called into question European regulators\u2019 ability to police car pollution standards. Bas Eickhout, a Dutch Green party member of the European parliament, said national authorities and the European commission had allowed the \u201cregulatory breakdown to occur\u201d. Speaking on Thursday, after the parliament announced it would begin an investigation into the VW scandal next month, he said: \u201cThe commission has serious questions to answer over revelations it failed to act on evidence that car manufacturers were using manipulation to avoid complying with EU car pollution rules. It must also explain why it sat on its hands in the face of evidence that many vehicles on the market exceeded EU pollution norms.\u201d In the UK vehicle standards are enforced by an executive arm of the department of transport, the VCA. The fact the scandal was uncovered in the US has caused soul searching in Europe, as officials scramble to overhaul vehicle-emissions tests. The European commission will push for the power to recall vehicles in breach of EU emissions standards, as well as the ability to fine carmakers that break pollution rules, when it announces a sweeping overhaul of car-sale regulations next week. However, the proposals could be weakened during the EU\u2019s lengthy legislative process and may run into opposition from countries with powerful car industries, such as Germany, France and the UK. The tension between the drive for tougher standards and leeway for the car industry is already visible as the EU struggles to bring emissions tests out of laboratory and into the real world. Last year, the British and German governments led efforts to water down reformed testing procedures for NOx emissions, a pollutant that causes the premature death of around 23,500 Britons each year. EU member states agreed to give carmakers more leeway to exceed pollution limits, as well as more time to adapt to stricter tests. These rules could yet be rejected by the European parliament in a make-or break vote next month, forcing lawmakers back to the drawing board.",

      "bodyText": "Pearson, Barclays and Virgin Media have added to the list of British employers announcing significant job cuts this week as they announced plans for thousands of redundancies. Education book publisher Pearson said it would cut 4,000 jobs, or 10% of its workforce, and undergo a restructuring to tackle problems with its business in the US, Brazil and South Africa. Most job losses will be lost in the US, where revenues have fallen most, but will also see the loss of around 500 jobs in the company\u2019s UK operations. Shares in the former owner of the Financial Times rose 17.4%, however, after it accompanied the cuts announcement with a pledge to maintain its dividend. Barclays also announced that it will cut about 1,200 jobs in investment banking worldwide and close a share trading operation in Asia. Some UK jobs are expected to go, but most redundancies will be in its investment banking businesses in Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. The latest Barclays cull comes on top of the 7,000 jobs cut since 2014 and the plan to chop a further 19,000 roles announced by new chief executive Jes Staley. In the telecommunications sector, Virgin Media said it was cutting 900 jobs, affecting sites in London and Birmingham. The company said the overhaul was about \u201cmaking sure we\u2019ve got the right people in the right areas\u201d. It added: \u201cIt\u2019s not a cost-cutting exercise, it\u2019s about tightening up the ship.\u201d The situation appeared to be gloomier for the 2,000 staff employed by shoe shop chain Brantano. Administrators at PwC have taken over the running of the business and will attempt to save the 140 stores and 60 concessions across the UK. The head office in Coalville, Leicestershire, employs around 200 staff. But PwC said Brantano, which includes the Jones the Bootmaker brand, was hit hard by the shift to online shopping, leading to speculation that only a few shops will survive. The threat to Brantano workers follows a series of redundancies at major employers this week. Sheffield Forgemasters told 100 staff they are in line for redundancy, just days after Tata Steel cut 1,050 jobs mainly at Port Talbot in south Wales. Asda is set to cut 1,000 jobs, including at its head office, where 3,000 people are employed. The chain, which is owned by US retail giant Walmart, said the job cuts were needed while it funded a revamp of its largest stores. Official figures show the UK jobs market is buoyant and that most sectors are seeking workers, though skills shortages have meant that many job vacancies go unfilled. The most recent data from the Office for National Statistics show there were 756,000 job vacancies for October to December 2015, 46,000 more than a year earlier and the highest since comparable records began in 2001.",

      "bodyText": "JP Morgan, the biggest bank in the US, has hinted it could quit the UK if Britain votes to leave the EU. The warning came as a number of US investment banks lined up to offer financial support to the In campaign. The bank\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s been a great home for financial companies and [EU membership] has benefited London quite a bit. We\u2019d like to stay there, but if we can\u2019t, we can\u2019t.\u201d JP Morgan employs about 19,000 people in the UK, with its main offices in Canary Wharf, Bournemouth and Glasgow. The bank employs Tony Blair as an adviser. Dimon was speaking on the sidelines of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos as it emerged that the bank is offering cash support to the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign. On Wednesday, it was revealed that Goldman Sachs has also pledged several hundred thousand pounds to the campaign. Morgan Stanley, which employs about 5,000 people in Britain, is understood to be planning a donation and Bank of America is reported to be considering doing so too. Dimon\u2019s suggestion that JP Morgan might quit the UK came as David Cameron called on business chiefs attending the Davos meeting to support him in keeping Britain in the 28-member union. \u201cI hope that businesses and NGOs and other organisations don\u2019t hold back,\u201d he said, urging them to make their views known before official campaign period gets underway. This is a once-in-a-generation moment and the stakes are high,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want a more competitive Europe, where the single market is completed, where there are more trade deals and fewer regulations: join me in making that case. If you believe, like I do, that Britain is better off in a reformed European Union, then, when the time comes, help me make that case for Britain to stay.\u201d Cameron has promised an in/out referendum by the end of next year, when he has completed renegotiations with Brussels. He aims to secure a reform deal next month but said he was in \u201cno hurry\u201d and would wait until the end of next year to hold the vote if necessary. Dimon refused to detail the exact scale of JP Morgan\u2019s donation to the in campaign but it is likely to be a significant sum of money. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve just starting. [I] wish we didn\u2019t have to do it at all.\u201d He added: \u201cI can\u2019t tell the British people what to do, it\u2019s up to them.\u201d The bank\u2019s plans to donate to the in campaign mean Wall Street could contribute millions of dollars to influence the vote while Britain\u2019s banks do not. Barclays\u2019 chairman, John McFarlane, has spoken in favour of Britain staying in the EU but Barclays\u2019 policy is not to make political donations. Allie Renison, head of Europe and trade policy at the Institute of Directors, said it was not clear whether the US banks\u2019 intervention would benefit or harm the In campaign. \u201cThese businesses employ thousands of people in the UK and businesses from outside the UK may be seen as having more credibility because they take an independent view. But I think it will be something the Out campaign is able to use to argue that staying in the EU is in the interests of big corporates, not all companies.\u201d Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, described the donations as \u201cthe unholy alliance of big banks and big politics\u201d. However, not all business leaders at Davos agree that a Brexit would be problematic. Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Renault-Nissan, told the Guardian he was unworried about the prospect of an out vote. Ghosn said: \u201c Whatever is the decision of the UK we will adapt to it. I don\u2019t think there is a reason to worry. We knew for many years that [an exit] was possible. So we\u2019ll deal with it\u201d. The US banks are free to make donations now because the rules of the referendum have not been set and the campaigns are not officially registered. Once the rules are established, businesses\u2019 ability to contribute may be restricted. US investment banks have based their European operations in London since the 1970s. They then made the City the centre of their international operations partly because of the UK\u2019s position between the time zones of Asia and the US. Moving operations to countries such as Ireland, France or Germany would be disruptive but the banks say they may have to do so if Britain no longer has the necessary trade agreements with the EU. The future of Europe has been debated among the 2,000 delegates to the annual gathering in the Swiss Alpine ski resort. The French prime minister, Manual Valls said it would be a \u201ctragedy for Europe\u201d if the UK electorate voted to leave. He added: \u201cWe must find a compromise, and everyone must contribute to it.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank brought respite to volatile financial markets after indicating it is ready to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone as soon as March. The ECB left interest rates on hold at its latest policy meeting but its president, Mario Draghi, acknowledged growing uncertainty about the economic outlook as he said the central bank would review its policy in March \u2013 sooner than many investors had been expecting. London\u2019s bluechip FTSE 100 index rebounded from a three-year low on Draghi\u2019s remarks, which followed assurances from his Bank of England counterpart, Mark Carney, this week that UK interest rates would stay at their record low amid turmoil on global markets and signs that the domestic economy had softened. The FTSE 100 closed up 100 points, or 1.8%, at 5,773.8 but it is still down more than 7% from the start of the year having sold off with other leading bourses around the world on worries over global growth and China\u2019s downturn. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 2%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.2% and the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.8% at the time of the London close. In December, the ECB expanded its quantitative easing programme - where the bank pumps money into the financial system by acquiring bonds \u2013 and trimmed a deposit rate paid on reserves held at the central bank. But the action was deemed too modest by market players at the time. Many had been expecting more aggressive moves following signals from Draghi that he was serious about lifting eurozone inflation out of the doldrums. Referring to a tumultuous start to the year on global markets, which has seen trillions of dollars wiped off the value of world shares and a 40% drop in oil prices since the last ECB policy meeting, Draghi used a news conference on Thursday to defend December\u2019s moves as entirely appropriate at the time. He told reporters: \u201cAs we start the new year, downside risks have increased again amid heightened uncertainty about emerging market economies\u2019 growth prospects, volatility in financial and commodity markets and geopolitical risks.\u201d \u201cIt will therefore be necessary to review and possibly reconsider our monetary policy stance at our next meeting in early March.\u201d On currency markets, the euro weakened to a two-week low against the dollar on the prospect of more monetary policy easing from the ECB as soon as March. Draghi\u2019s comments also moved oil prices: Brent crude was up more than 6% from the previous session at $29.60 per barrel. The price had fallen below $28 this week as worries about oversupply intensified on the prospect of fresh supply from Iran after the lifting of sanctions last week. Analysts cautioned that Draghi\u2019s words had soothed markets for now, but they would need to be followed with real action. \u201cECB president Draghi once again saw the equity markets confirm his \u2018super\u2019 status as they jumped almost as soon as he started his speech,\u201d said Alastair McCaig, analyst at online trading company IG. \u201cAll in all, it was very impressive, especially when you consider he didn\u2019t actually promise anything, but he was convincing enough to get JPMorgan, RBS and Barclays to bring forward their calls for further easing from June to March.\u201d Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at the foreign exchange company Monex Europe, said any euphoria on the back of promises of central bank action may prove to be fleeting and that it remained unclear if the ECB was willing to commit to the sort of \u201cmassive, unconditional and open-ended QE programmes\u201d seen from the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve. \u201cAs commodity prices fall and base effects from the euro fade, deflation will again threaten the eurozone and inflation expectations could begin to fall apart. If this is how 2016 plays out, vague promises will no longer be enough to keep the economy on track and the ECB will be forced to put its money where Draghi\u2019s mouth is,\u201d Berich said.",

Several supermarkets said they were already running low on stocks of ginger nuts and some have already sold out of Carr\u2019s water biscuits. The factory in Caldewgate was inundated with 5ft of floodwater on 6 December. Owner United Biscuits said it would take several months to restart the brick ovens which give its water biscuits their distinctive taste and crunch. It said it had been unable to find alternative facilities elsewhere in the country to pick up production. The biscuit manufacturer has placed newspaper adverts headed: \u201cFlooding in water biscuit factory. Oh the irony.\u201d The ad said the factory had suffered significant damage and the heavy rain had \u201ctaken its toll on our community\u201d. Around 400 staff, contractors and suppliers are now working to get the factory back into full working order. Production on one line, McVitie\u2019s Gold Bar, has restarted. United Biscuits said: \u201cDue to floods in Carlisle we are experiencing a shortage of a number products under the McVitie\u2019s, Jacob\u2019s, Carr\u2019s and Crawford\u2019s brands. We apologise if consumers are finding it difficult to get hold of some of these products and we are working hard at our Carlisle site to resume normal service as soon as possible.\u201d There had been fears that the business, which employs more than 600 people and is one of Carlisle\u2019s biggest employers, would not be restarted because it had been also hit by flooding in 2005. It only reopened thanks to a \u00a31m government grant. According to the local paper Carlisle News &amp; Star the insurance claim for the factory this time round could be as high as \u00a350m. The figure is likely to include compensation for lost production, as well as repairs to the building and equipment. Mike Heaney, factory general manager at United Biscuits, said: \u201cResuming factory production is a priority for us and our teams are well on track with this as our Gold Bar production has started. However we also recognise the importance of community at a time like this. Many of our employees have taken the time to support those most affected by the floods and keep spirits high, providing local rescue centres with supplies and carrying out local door-to-door biscuit drops. \u201cUnited Biscuits greatly appreciates the support that has been offered, and our thoughts remain with the thousands of people in Cumbria who have been impacted by the floods.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Workaholics of Wall Street, Jamie Dimon has some news for you. It\u2019s time to kick off those wingtips, slip out of that suit and chillax. The JPMorgan Chase boss has become the latest financier to worry that his bankers are working too hard for their bonuses. On Thursday the bank announced an initiative called \u201cPencils Down\u201d, aimed at helping its employees improve their work-life balance. Previously, young bankers were allowed one work-free weekend a month. Now the bank wants them to take every weekend off unless they are working on a \u201clive\u201d deal. Work-free weekends are \u201crealistic to what this generation wants\u201d, Carlos Hernandez, JPMorgan\u2019s head of global banking, told the Wall Street Journal. Wall Street\u2019s banks first began to review their weekend policies in 2013 after the death of a 21-year-old Bank of America Merrill Lynch intern, Moritz Erhardt. Erhardt was found dead after having an epileptic seizure in a shower after working a 72-hour shift. \u201cOne of the triggers for epilepsy is exhaustion and it may be that because Moritz had been working so hard his fatigue was a trigger for the seizure that killed him. But that\u2019s only a possibility,\u201d coroner Mary Hassell said at the time. Despite the fact that his death could not be definitely linked to work-related exhaustion, it left a lasting effect on the banking industry. James Gorman, chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley, said that Erhardt\u2019s death \u201chas caused everyone to step back and say, \u2018Hey, have we got this right?\u2019\u201d Goldman Sachs began to require that all analysts and associates be out of office and not work between 9pm on Friday and 9am on Sunday. JPMorgan implemented a policy of giving young bankers one work-free weekend a month, also known as \u201cprotected weekend\u201d. Other banks like Bank of America, Citigroup, Barclays and Deutsche Bank implemented similar policies to help their young staff maintain some semblance of a work-life balance. Yet the real culprit behind work-life imbalance at banks is the actual workload, say some bankers. \u201cIf you have 80 hours of work to do in a week, you\u2019re going to have 80 hours of work to do in a week, regardless of whether you\u2019re working Saturdays or not. That work is going to be pushed to Sundays or Friday nights,\u201d one junior banker at Deutsche Bank told the New York Times, when policies limiting weekend work first came about. While in Davos in 2014, Gorman said that he wasn\u2019t sure if limiting weekend work was \u201cthe right answer\u201d. Morgan Stanley did not introduce an official rule about work on weekends. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how you stop work if there\u2019s a deal on,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s more common sense, it\u2019s more upward feedback and evaluation. If we have individuals who are not managing the young folks properly, we need to deal with that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The new Barclays boss, Jes Staley, has kicked off a fresh wave of cuts at the group\u2019s investment banking arm, with plans to axe 1,200 jobs and pull out of several Asian countries. Barclays said it would close offices in nine countries around the world, with the Asia Pacific region bearing the brunt of the cuts. The bank will pull out of Australia, Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, but will offer banking coverage for those countries from other locations. It will keep offices in Hong Kong, China, Japan, Singapore and India, and hold on to its prime brokerage and derivatives business in Asia. Barclays\u2019 investment bank is also exiting Russia and will cover the country from London instead. It is scaling back cash equity sales around the globe, with the planned withdrawal from some central European and Middle Eastern countries as well as in the Asia Pacific zone. The bank\u2019s China business is not affected by the cutbacks. Staley, a former JPMorgan Chase banker who took the reins at the end of last year, and Barclays chairman John McFarlane will update the City on strategy at the bank\u2019s annual results on 1 March. Barclays said it expects to report investment bank income broadly flat on 2014. The bank said the cutbacks form part of the strategy announced in May 2014 to focus on the UK, the US and serving clients globally, while exiting certain product lines. The bank stressed that it would still have a strong presence in Asia. The bank\u2019s then-boss Antony Jenkins unveiled 19,000 job cuts as it dramatically scaled back its investment bank. Staley said: \u201cWith these actions, we are accelerating the investment bank strategy outlined in 2014, focusing on its core strengths and running the business for returns. We continue to build on the business\u2019s dual home markets in the UK and US and remain committed to a strong presence in Asia and EMEA, consistent with operating a leading global investment bank within the Barclays group.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown called for governments, business and charitable foundations to provide the money to put every Syrian refugee child in school, as he warned that the greatest humanitarian disaster since the second world war risked creating a lost generation. The former British prime minister, now the UN special envoy for education, told the Davos economic summit that the current market turmoil should not be used as an excuse for inaction. He said: \u201cWhatever the difficulties in financial markets and whatever difficulties countries have with their individual aid budgets, we have to come together in the face of this great humanitarian crisis.\u201d Brown, who praised the Guardian for its Christmas appeal for refugees which raised more than \u00a32m, said there were now 60 million displaced people around the world, 20 million of them refugees. \u201cSyria is at the epicentre with the fastest growing problem \u2013 12 million displaced persons, 4 million of them refugees, 2 million of them children.\u201d The former prime minister said that within a year the number of Syrian refugee children would swell to close to 2.5 million, and that $750m (\u00a3530m) was needed to fund an extra 1m school places. He added that $500m had already been raised from a variety of sources, including the EU and the World Bank, but an additional $250m was needed by 4 February, when the UK will host an international conference on the refugee crisis in London. \u201cWithout action now, these young Syrians will become a lost generation.\u201d Brown added that young Syrians had to be given hope. \u201cThere is no solution to the exodus to Europe without an expansion of education.\u201d Jim Yong-kim, the president of the World Bank, said the refugee problem had intensified and he had been asked by the UN chief, Ban Ki-moon, to rethink the humanitarian response to the crisis so that emergency assistance formed part of a long-term development plan. Speaking to the Guardian in Davos, Jim said the bill for refugees was soaring and a new approach was needed. \u201cPeople are attached to staying where they are but there has to be hope of finding work. \u201cWe have to build up the productive capacity of countries with large numbers of refugees. We have to make it attractive to stay in these countries.\u201d Justine Greening, the UK\u2019s international development secretary, strongly backed the idea of spending more on schools as part of a comprehensive approach designed to build up economies in the Middle East. She said: \u201cBillions of euros can be spent on failure or they can be put it into a constructive, positive response which meets what the refugees really want \u2013 education and a job.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "About 2,000 jobs are at risk after the shoe retailer Brantano called in administrators on the back of a tough Christmas on the high street. The accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has been appointed as the administrator and has said it will try to save the business. The collapse of Brantano is the first high-profile failure on the high street this year. Retailers suffered a difficult period in the run-up to Christmas, traditionally the most lucrative time of year. Consumers shopped online instead of on the high street and warmer than average weather dampened demand for winter clothing. Brantano, which is owned by private equity firm Alteri, has 140 shops and 60 concessions across the UK, employing about 2,000 staff. The firm was founded in Belgium in 1953 and expanded into the UK by buying 47 Shoe City shops in 1998. The administrator has already received more than 10 expressions of interests from private investors and other retailers about buying the chain. PwC has pledged that it will try to find a buyer for Brantano as a whole, with its shops remaining open for the moment. However, the retailer could be broken up if retailers look to buy its prime sites. Brantano\u2019s shops are primarily large out-of-town units in retail parks, while the concessions are located in garden centres. In the past few years, many retailers have gone into administration before or after Christmas, including Woolworths, HMV, Zavvi, and Jessops. Brantano\u2019s collapse is likely to raise questions about the role of Alteri, which just three months ago paid an estimated \u00a312m to buy Brantano and Jones Bootmaker from Dutch company Macintosh. PwC insisted that Alteri had made \u201csustained efforts\u201d to rescue Brantano. Tony Barrell, lead administrator at PwC, said Brantano had been hit hard by the change in consumer shopping habits: \u201cThe continuing challenging conditions for bricks and mortar retail stores are well documented. Like many others, Brantano has been hit hard by the change in consumers\u2019 shopping habits and the evolution of the UK retail environment. \u201cThe administrators are continuing to trade the businesses as normal while we assess the trading strategy over the coming days and weeks. Staff will be paid their arrears of wages and salaries, and will continue to be paid for their work during the administration.\u201d The administration only involves Brantano (UK) Limited, the UK arm of the brand. Jones Bootmaker is not affected.",

    "webTitle": "Jaguar Land Rover races past Nissan to become UK's biggest carmaker", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jaguar Land Rover has become the biggest carmaker in Britain for the first time, capping a remarkable turnaround for the company after it almost collapsed in 2009. It produced 489,923 cars in 2015, up by 9% year on year, moving ahead of Nissan, which produced 476,589, a 4.7% decline. JLR produces cars at three plants: Castle Bromwich and Solihull in the West Midlands and Halewood in Merseyside. Nissan had been the biggest car manufacturer in Britain since 1999. Its factory in Sunderland, which will be 30 years old this year, remains the biggest plant in the country. JLR was on the brink of collapse seven years ago after global car sales slumped on the back of the financial crisis. In 2009, it produced 158,000 cars. Since then, Tata, the Indian owner of the luxury carmaker, has revitalised the company by pumping more than \u00a311bn into research and development. The company now employs 35,000 people in the UK, double the figure five years ago. Its popular models include the Range Rover Evoque and the Jaguar F-Type. The number of cars manufactured in Britain reached the highest level for a decade in 2015 thanks to the success of JLR, Mini and Toyota. Car manufacturing increased by 3.9% year on year in 2015 to 1,587,677 cars, the biggest output since 2005. This included a 2.7% rise in the number of cars exported to an all-time high of 1,227,881. As well as the growth at JLR, there was a 12.4% increase in production for Mini, the third biggest manufacturer in the country, and Toyota, the fourth. George Osborne, the chancellor, hailed the figures as evidence that the UK economy is rebalancing. \u201cBacking Britain\u2019s car industry has been a priority for this government and today we see the industry going from strength to strength,\u201d he said. \u201cI am hugely encouraged that manufacturing is at a 10-year high and exports \u200eare at a record level. All this means jobs and the security of a pay packet for workers and their families. \u201cOur plans to rebalance the economy mean we have to continue to build on our great manufacturing strengths in the Midlands and the north of England, and work together to ensure that Britain continues to prosper as a global leader in car production.\u201d The all-time record for car production in Britain was achieved in 1972, when 1.92m vehicles were manufactured. The increase in 2015 was achieved despite the slowdown in China. The US overtook China to become the single biggest export market for the UK, with demand up by 26.5%. This meant that the US accounted for 10.9% of exports, compared to 7% for China, although the European Union was the biggest export market as a whole, accounting for 57.5% of UK car exports. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which produced the figures, said: \u201cDespite export challenges in some key markets such as Russia and China, foreign demand for British-built cars has been strong, reaching record export levels in the past year.\u201d Hawes said it was vital for the automotive industry that the UK remained in the EU. \u201cContinued growth in an intensely competitive global marketplace is far from guaranteed and depends heavily on global economic conditions and political stability,\u201d he said. \u201cEurope is our biggest trading partner and the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union is vital for the automotive sector in order to secure future growth and jobs.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Financial Reporting Council is considering an investigation into KPMG\u2019s auditing of HBOS, the bank that almost collapsed at the peak of the financial crisis. The accounting regulator said its conduct committee had asked its head of enforcement, Gareth Rees, to make inquiries into whether KPMG committed misconduct when it signed off HBOS\u2019s books for 2007. Rees will examine whether it was correct for KPMG to allow HBOS to be classed as a going concern in its 2007 accounts, and whether major worries about the bank\u2019s viability should have been included in the financial statements. Rees\u2019s inquiries are preliminary and may not lead to a full inquiry but the decision to start the process represents a significant step amid political pressure for a full investigation of KPMG\u2019s role. If a full inquiry goes ahead, the firm and individual accountants who worked on HBOS could face punishment. HBOS, which traded as Halifax and Bank of Scotland, was forced to ask shareholders for \u00a34bn to prop up its finances in April 2008 just two months after its annual accounts gave it a clean bill of health. The bank almost imploded in September 2008 and was rescued by Lloyds in a government-engineered takeover. The combined bank was bailed out by taxpayers a month later at a cost of \u00a320bn. The FRC said it asked Rees to investigate after reading a report by financial regulators into HBOS\u2019s collapse published in November. The FRC has already looked at HBOS\u2019s bad debt provisions and decided there were not grounds for a full investigation but it has come under pressure to look further into KPMG\u2019s conduct. After the HBOS report was published, Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury committee, criticised the FRC for not conducting a full investigation into KPMG\u2019s auditing of HBOS. Tyrie wrote to the council urging them to get on with an investigation quickly. Tyrie said on Thursday: \u201cThis is not before time. A great deal depends on the quality of audited accounts. They were found wanting during the financial crisis. It is essential that everybody fully understands why. That is why this investigation is so important. The committee will be keeping a close eye on it.\u201d Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors business lobby group, said it was essential that investors had faith in the audited accounts of UK companies and that the FRC needed to conduct a thorough review to maintain confidence. Walker said: \u201cShareholders and customers deserve to know what role the firm\u2019s auditors, KPMG, played in this scandal. External audits must be rigorous and fit for purpose, especially when it comes to systemically important and bewilderingly complex financial institutions. \u201cThere is more at stake here than just the integrity of a few regulators and the inquiry cannot just be about spreading blame. Shareholders need confidence in the financial statements offered by companies and they have a right to know that auditors are properly scrutinising the books.\u201d A spokesman for KPMG, one of the big four accountancy firms, said it supported a thorough review of the HBOS affair and that it was important for conclusions to be reached speedily. He added: \u201cWe were pleased that the [Prudential Regulation Authority] and Financial Conduct Authority] report issued last November recognised that KPMG provided robust challenge and delivered clear warnings to HBOS and that this resulted in a more prudent approach to provisioning than would otherwise have been adopted. We will continue to cooperate with the FRC as it makes its preliminary enquiries.\u201d",

Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, announced in Davos on Thursday that he was creating his organisation\u2019s first high-level panel on women\u2019s economic empowerment, which will come up with a plan of action later this year. The move resulted from an initiative by Justine Greening, the UK\u2019s development secretary, who has argued that providing opportunities for girls and women will lead to stronger growth and higher levels of prosperity. The UN said women globally earned 24% less than men for doing the same work, and that 75% of women\u2019s work in developing countries was informal and unprotected. It cited a report by the McKinsey Global Institute showing that an additional $28tn (\u00a320tn) could be added to the world economy if women played an identical role in markets to men. The UN panel will publish its recommendations in September, and they are likely to include the provision of better access for women to finance, the ability to set up a business and the right to set up a bank account in countries where it is currently forbidden. The he World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are supporting the new UN panel. \u201cThe empowerment of the world\u2019s women is a global imperative,\u201d Ban Ki-moon said. \u201cYet despite important progress in promoting gender equality, there remains an urgent need to address structural barriers to women\u2019s economic empowerment and full inclusion in economic activity. If the world is to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, we need a quantum leap in women\u2019s economic empowerment.\u201d Greening, who is a member of the panel, said: \u201cInvesting in girls and women isn\u2019t just about basic human rights, it\u2019s about fully unlocking the potential of half the world\u2019s population. The UK is already at the forefront of this effort. \u201cAt the Department for International Development I have put improving the lives of girls and women at the very heart of our work and Britain is successfully leading the fight against FGM and child marriage, as well as getting girls into school and women into jobs. \u201cStrong economies need the contribution of everyone, including women, and this panel will spearhead a movement to put women\u2019s economic empowerment on the global agenda like never before.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The federal government has decided not to take action against Adani for its failure to declare its Australian chief executive ran a mining company in Zambia which had pleaded guilty to serious environmental harm. The ABC reported that prior to approving Adani\u2019s proposed $16bn Carmichael mine in Queensland, the federal environment department wrote to Adani\u2019s Australian head, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, and asked for information about any executive officer who had \u201cbeen the subject of any civil or criminal penalties or compliance-related findings, for breaches of, or noncompliance with environmental laws ... [and] information about his or her roles both in Australia and in other countries\u201d. In its response, the company failed to mention that Janakaraj himself had been in charge of a copper mine in Zambia that had polluted a major river with dangerous contaminants in 2010, the ABC reported. Under section 489 of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, providing false or misleading information could be an offence. The Zambian mine was owned by Konkola Copper Mines, for which Janakaraj was head of operations. KCM was convicted on four charges, including wilfully failing to report the pollution in the Kafue River, the ABC reported. Janakaraj himself was not charged over the contamination. The federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, approved Adani\u2019s Carmichael mine with the limited information. A month later ABC revealed KCM\u2019s convictions. The federal environment department then approached Adani to ask why it had not provided this information. The department decided the omission was a mistake and did not warrant further action. \u201cThe Department of the Environment has completed its inquiries into the omission of a component of the environmental history of one of the executive officers of Adani Mining Pty Ltd,\u201d a spokesperson for the department told Guardian Australia over email. \u201cAs a result of these inquiries it was found that the omission did not result in environmental harm, that the omission was likely due to a mistake and that Adani officials provided full cooperation ... In this instance and having due regard to the available responses within the Compliance and Enforcement Policy: Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the department elected to not take further compliance action on this matter.\u201d Ariane Wilkinson, a lawyer at Environmental Justice Australia, said that \u201cwhether or not Adani\u2019s omission to the department caused environmental harm completely misses the point\u201d. \u201cThis was an important omission in checking Adani\u2019s environmental history, something that must take place before approvals are given. Properly considering a company\u2019s environmental history should inform whether or not you give an approval in the first place, and what kind of conditions you apply,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cThe department\u2019s weak response is disappointing, but also unsurprising. It\u2019s a good example of why the Australian community needs access to the law to hold decision-makers and corporations to account, and to protect our environment.\u201d The Carmichael mine remains subject to a challenge in the federal court by traditional owners who say Adani misled the National Native Title Tribunal about how many jobs it would create. Doubts also remain over whether the mine will get the financing it needs to go ahead. Adani has also asked the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to be given special treatment and protected from further challenges. If the mine does go ahead, it would produce more annual emissions than New York City, totalling about 79m tonnes of CO2 each year. An Adani spokesman told the ABC that Janakaraj was committed to proactive and good environmental management.",

      "bodyText": "The latest figures on building activity in Australia show that in the September quarter of last year a record level of residential building work occurred. And yet, despite the apparent building boom, the market still expects the Reserve Bank to cut rates by July this year. In the September quarter last year a record $13,622m in private sector residential building work occurred: This was up 1.2% on the June quarter and marked the ninth consecutive quarter of positive growth in trend terms. As with most of the housing boom since 2012, the growth is mostly coming via the building of apartments and other non-house residential buildings \u2013 blocks of flats, attached townhouses, semi-detached houses, etc. The quarterly growth of \u201cother residential\u201d buildings remained a solid 3.1%, whereas for the first time in two years, there was a decline in the trend growth of the value of houses being built: Such has been the splurge in building of apartments that houses, which back in the 1980s accounted for 75% of all residential building work, and which even at the start of 2012 accounted for 62% of the total, in September accounted for just 51% of private sector building numbers: And yet, while the residential building sector looks to be booming, the current market settings are predicting that the Reserve Bank will cut rates in July. This is a change from late last year when the market had effectively given up on another rate cut. The RBA\u2019s language at the time seemed to suggest that in terms of more rate cuts, they had called stumps. But now, the market thinks a cut could come as early as May and is actively pricing in a rate cut by July: It rather beggars belief. Employment is growing solidly, the housing market, despite a slowing of investment, is still rising well. Another rate cut now \u2013 especially at a time when the dollar is bumping along below $US0.70 \u2013 would seem out of joint with the usual conditions required for a cut. Perhaps a small reasoning lies in the drop off of building of actual houses, as opposed to the more investor-driven apartments. In the September quarter, building work commenced on 28,249 houses \u2013 just six more than there were in the September quarter in 2014: The market may be betting that given concerns in the broader world economy \u2013 such as the IMF once again downgrading its projections for world growth in 2016 and the relatively slow growth in China \u2013 that an interest rate cut is needed to keep the housing market (and Australian economy) going. But it\u2019s a pretty risky bet \u2013 and that\u2019s pretty much all the market predictions for future interest rates are. The market is certainly not infallible \u2013 in February 2014, it expected the cash rate to rise in 2015 from 2.5% to 3.0%; instead it fell to 2.0%. It\u2019s a risky bet because it places a fair bit of faith in the strength of the rules set down by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (Apra) to limit investor activity. While theoretically Apra setting a limit of 10% annual investor credit growth should allow for the RBA to cut rates and keep the housing market from overheating, given the current levels of housing debt, the RBA would have to be reticent to cut rates further with a view to stimulate a sector that already is doing OK. And given the explosion in apartment buildings in the past three years, the RBA would also be wary of oversupply of such buildings \u2013 especially in Sydney and Melbourne. The data suggests there is already a lot of building work still to be done. In the past two years, rather unusually, the commencement of building work on apartments has far outstripped the completion of such building work: So while there does already look to be a good deal of work coming down the pipeline, there is also the issue of oversupply. In the past 12 to 18 months there has been a massive surge in both Sydney and Melbourne of the number of apartments that have been approved for building, but for which work has not yet commenced. In September 2013, NSW had 7,464 apartments approved for building, but which were yet to commence construction; two years later that figure is up to 12,354 \u2013 a 65% increase. In Victoria, the increase in that period is an astonishing 82%: Now sure, some of these will end up being built, but the sharp rise also suggests the supply of new such buildings is outstripping the demand for them to be built. The picture is thus one of a residential sector where house construction has come somewhat off the boil, but apartment building continues to soar. And while the market might think a rate cut is coming, I suspect we would need to see a sharp fall in private sector housing activity as well as a slowdown in employment growth before the RBA will be inclined to act.",

This is a change from late last year when the market had effectively given up on another rate cut. The RBA\u2019s language at the time seemed to suggest that in terms of more rate cuts, they had called stumps.</p> <p>But now, the market thinks a cut could come as early as May and is actively pricing in a rate cut by July:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Market expectations of the RBA cash rate.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aVrd4/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It rather beggars belief. </p> <p>Employment is growing solidly, the housing market, despite a slowing of investment, is still <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jan/18/dont-get-too-excited-about-the-cooling-housing-market-the-cost-of-loans-is-skyrocketing\">rising well</a>. Another rate cut now \u2013 especially at a time when the dollar is bumping along below $US0.70 \u2013 would seem out of joint with the usual conditions required for a cut.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jan/18/dont-get-too-excited-about-the-cooling-housing-market-the-cost-of-loans-is-skyrocketing\">Don't get too excited about the cooling housing market \u2013 the cost of loans is skyrocketing | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps a small reasoning lies in the drop off of building of actual houses, as opposed to the more investor-driven apartments. </p> <p>In the September quarter, building work commenced on 28,249 houses \u2013 just six more than there were in the September quarter in 2014: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of private sector residential building commencements.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dAtf2/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The market may be betting that given concerns in the broader world economy \u2013 such as the IMF <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/update/01/pdf/0116.pdf\">once again downgrading</a> its projections for world growth in 2016 and the relatively slow growth in China \u2013 that an interest rate cut is needed to keep the housing market (and Australian economy) going.</p> <p>But it\u2019s a pretty risky bet \u2013 and that\u2019s pretty much all the market predictions for future interest rates are. The market is certainly not infallible \u2013 in February 2014, it expected the cash rate to rise in 2015 from 2.5% to 3.0%; instead it fell to 2.0%. </p> <p>It\u2019s a risky bet because it places a fair bit of faith in the strength of the rules set down by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (Apra) to limit investor activity. While theoretically Apra setting a limit of 10% annual investor credit growth should allow for the RBA to cut rates and keep the housing market from overheating, given the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/15/how-australian-households-became-the-most-indebted-in-the-world\">current levels of housing debt</a>, the RBA would have to be reticent to cut rates further with a view to stimulate a sector that already is doing OK. </p> <p>And given the explosion in apartment buildings in the past three years, the RBA would also be wary of oversupply of such buildings \u2013 especially in Sydney and Melbourne. </p> <p>The data suggests there is already a lot of building work still to be done. In the past two years, rather unusually, the commencement of building work on apartments has far outstripped the completion of such building work:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Number of private sector residential non-houses commenced and completed.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mbIyr/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So while there does already look to be a good deal of work coming down the pipeline, there is also the issue of oversupply. </p> <p>In the past 12 to 18 months there has been a massive surge in both Sydney and Melbourne of the number of apartments that have been approved for building, but for which work has not yet commenced. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Dwellings approved not commenced\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5XENc/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption>Dwellings approved but not yet commenced - NSW.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In September 2013, NSW had 7,464 apartments approved for building, but which were yet to commence construction; two years later that figure is up to 12,354 \u2013 a 65% increase. </p> <p>In Victoria, the increase in that period is an astonishing 82%: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Dwellings approved but not yet commenced - Victoria.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/x9j17/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>Now sure, some of these will end up being built, but the sharp rise also suggests the supply of new such buildings is outstripping the demand for them to be built. </p> <p>The picture is thus one of a residential sector where house construction has come somewhat off the boil, but apartment building continues to soar. And while the market might think a rate cut is coming, I suspect we would need to see a sharp fall in private sector housing activity as well as a slowdown in employment growth before the RBA will be inclined to act. </p>",
