      "bodyText": "When Facebook was preparing to float in May 2012, former analyst Henry Blodget \u2013 now the high-energy editor of the Business Insider website \u2013 was unambiguous. The stock was, he said, \"muppet bait\" \u2013 so widely anticipated and hyped that there was no chance of beating the market by subscribing to the IPO and then \"flipping\" the shares on the first day. The $38 launch came, and the price duly went down. Blodget's warning had been correct. Plenty of professionals and amateurs made paper losses. Yet 15 months on, Facebook shares have finally reached $38 again, having roared back from $26 in just over a week. (They closed at $38.05 on Friday.) Suddenly Facebook, like the Muppets themselves, is enjoying something of a revival. Analysts who had written off the social network's chances against Google had to eat their words. Revenues jumped 53% in the second quarter to $1.81bn, the company said last month. And a significant, and growing, proportion of that \u2013 41% of all its advertising revenue \u2013 came from mobile. This is important, because more and more people are using the internet through their smartphone. In the past year Facebook's mobile-only users have more than doubled, to 219 million, while the number of people using the mobile site some of the time is up to 600 million, from 441 million. That growth, and the decline in its desktop-only users (falling by about 38 million a quarter) suggests that by the end of this year mobile-only users will outnumber the desktop-only ones. For a site that began on the desktop in 2004, it will be a significant moment, and in terms of making money it had looked like a significant challenge. Until now, perhaps. Richard Holway, a veteran industry analyst at TechMarketView, recently called Facebook \"a passing fad\". But even he says he is \"in awe of what they have achieved in the past six months\". In particular, he's impressed at how Facebook has converted its growing base of mobile users into a source of advertising revenue. \"Incorporating adverts into the news feed \u2013 thing people see on the mobile site \u2013 rather than irritating them with ads on the side, or flashing and taking over the screen, is so clever. People find that acceptable. To have cracked a way of getting people to accept mobile ads is quite an achievement,\" Holway says. Richard Windsor, a former Nomura technology analyst who now runs his own consultancy, said of Facebook's second-quarter figures: \"One out of every 20 items [in the news feed] is an advertisement, and there has been no drop in satisfaction, which mean the advertising is relevant to the users and they are tolerant of it. How far Facebook can push this is uncertain, but I suspect this could probably go to one item in 10 items before users start getting annoyed.\" For Mark Zuckerberg, who in June had to suffer being upbraided by angry shareholders at the company's first annual meeting as the stock sat 37% below its offer price, this is a welcome relief. Yet he still faces searching questions about Facebook's future. During the earnings call for the second-quarter figures, he was asked about a Pew Internet poll from May which suggested that American teenagers are abandoning Facebook for instant messaging services such as WhatsApp and Twitter, and image-sharing sites like Snapchat. \"Based on our data, that's simply not true,\" Zuckerberg shot back. They may not be joining the service much, but \"we've been fully penetrated in the teen demographic for a while now\". But to Holway, that message means Facebook has hit a plateau: \"And we all know what comes after a plateau.\" Granted, from its plateau Facebook can look down on a lot of rivals, including Yahoo and Microsoft, Apple's iAds, and music services Pandora and Spotify. According to eMarketer, which tracks mobile market ad spending, Facebook's mobile revenues will more than triple this year to just over $2bn, and it will more than double its share of the global mobile advertising market \u2013 to almost 13%, up from just over 5% when it started selling mobile ads in 2012. The challenge remains Google, which scooped more than half the global $8.8bn mobile ad market in 2012. Despite Facebook's growth, in 2013 Google will account for 56%, eMarketer predicts. Windsor warns: \"The problem is that when Facebook has maximised the monetisation of social networking, growth will grind to halt. The better things are now, the more quickly this will happen.\" Overall, he still thinks Facebook is \"a one-trick pony offering very little outside of its core social networking service\". He points out that despite Facebook being one of the most-used social networking apps, it accounts for just 26% of the time the average person spends on a smartphone. Google has services for 66% (email, browsing, maps, social networking). That, he suggests, is why Google makes so much more from mobile. Facebook tried to address that with the release in April of Facebook Home, an app that would transform phones running Google's Android software into an all-Facebook, all-the-time experience. There was also a dedicated phone, the HTC First (made with the Taiwanese handset maker), which would have Facebook Home installed from the start. It was a colossal flop. Reports suggested AT&amp;T sold a few thousand of the handsets in the US before axing it, leaving HTC with excess products. Meanwhile the Guardian's revelations about Facebook's co-operation (along with others) with the US National Security Agency had hurt it at a time when it wanted to re-emphasise privacy. It may not be a coincidence that on Wednesday it announced that all connections to Facebook are now encrypted \u2013 though data on its servers won't necessarily be. Holway suggests that as the world moves more and more to mobile, Facebook may actually have an edge over Google. \"Facebook seems to be making more per mobile click than before,\" he says. \"Whereas what has spooked the markets about Google is that it is making less per click on mobile.\" That has seen Google's share price decline as it has seen those less valuable clicks - while Facebook is turning mobile views into money. Even so, he sticks to his warning about \"a passing fad\". That followed his own experience in Hong Kong recently, where he walked through a commuter carriage one morning looking at what people were viewing on their smartphones and tablets. \"I couldn't find a single one who was on Facebook,\" he says. \"And these were people aged 18-30 going to work, on a Mass Transit train which provides free Wi-Fi. That was a real eye-opener to me.\" It was on that basis that he called Facebook a \"passing fad\" \u2013 though he notes that even if it is, Zuckerberg's dream need not die. It can just buy the companies its target audience has shifted to. In May it was rumoured to be bidding for Waze, the Israeli social mapping company. Google won that auction, but the intention was clear: Facebook wants to vacuum up all other emerging \"social\" networks. Facebook has already bought photo-sharing site Instagram for $1bn; there's no reason why it might not follow that with Snapchat, which has entranced tens of millions of teens the world over with its short-lived shared photos. \"Facebook is worth $95bn,\" Holway laughs. \"You can buy an awful lot of companies with that.\" Perhaps the \"muppets\" will see some benefits after all.",

      "bodyText": "We nearly all do it: no sooner have we got through airport security than we are into the shops, splashing out on everything from Gucci loafers to headphones, Havaianas and headache pills. At Heathrow alone, 70 million passengers a year with an hour or so to kill add up to serious spending power. So popular are the airport's shops that last year sales per square foot at its retail outlets hit a staggering \u00a32,782 \u2013 making it one of the most productive shopping destinations in the country. By comparison, Oxford Street's Selfridges took around \u00a31,500 per square foot in the same period, and Harrods in Knightsbridge a relatively paltry \u00a31,000. Some retailers have known about the power of airports for years \u2013 WH Smith's once near basket-case high street business was helped back to financial health by its airside stores. Dixons' four Heathrow stores are among the five best-performing stores in the company's portfolio. Average spend per shopper at Heathrow now stands at \u00a338.86, up from \u00a324.68 in 2002, an increase of 57%, while retail sales through the airport have increased 47% in the past decade, to \u00a31.7bn last year. The new Terminal 2, due to open next June and servicing, among others, the 27 Star Alliance airlines, including US Airways, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines, will have a two-level departure lounge lined with shops. Its retail space has proved so popular that there have been five businesses vying for each of the available 69 sites \u2013 52 shops and 17 bars or restaurants. Heathrow management says it has \"defined a fresh retail vision\" for the shops, which includes concepts like \"SoLoMo\" \u2013 dedicated \"social location mobile\" apps to help customers find their way around the stores . Department store group John Lewis will open its first airport store here, selling mainly John Lewis own-brand products and its own designer ranges. Sean Allam, the group's director of commercial operations, hopes the new outlet will raise the profile of the brand abroad: \"We expect the venture to build awareness of the John Lewis brand to target customers in a number of overseas territories, supporting both our online and wholesale business.\" Fashion brands such as Mulberry, Dior, Gucci, and many more are finding airport outlets lucrative, thanks to the spending power of wealthy passengers with time on their hands. Muriel Zingraff-Shariff, retail director at Heathrow, explains: \"A lot of women business passengers, who come in and out every week, tell us it's great because while they're here \u2013 having to be here early \u2013 they can do some shopping, which they never have time to do in town because they're too busy.\" Over in Terminal 5, Nandita Mahtani, a fashion designer heading to Mumbai, is a case in point. She has just left the Tiffany's store clutching a small bag. She says: \"I've bought some gifts for friends back home. I knew I would buy something in the airport because I didn't have time when I was in London.\" Around 70% of Heathrow's passengers are from outside the European Union and it is the airport of choice for international businessmen and women travelling via the UK. Last year spending by tourists from the Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), with their fast-growing, high-spending middle classes, increased by 18%. A walk through Terminal 5 is like a stroll down Paris's Rue St Honor\u00e9 or Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, with Burberry, Bulgari, Smythson and Prada all there. And unlike on the high street, the doors are open, and there are no buzzers or burly security men. Zingraff-Shariff jokes: \"If anyone tries to steal anything, they're not going to get very far in an airport.\" Dolce &amp; Gabbana moved in last year, opening its first non-Italian airport store. It replaced a Nokia shop, in a clear sign that the airport and its rich passengers wants more fashion brands. A Mulberry spokesman said the brand's airport stores were among its best performers. Four of Burberry's 11 UK stores are in airports, targeting what chief executive Angela Ahrendts calls the travelling luxury consumer. \"When Chinese consumers travel,\" she said recently, \"they spend six times more than when they stay at home \u2026 Saying 'I bought this in London' adds cachet.\" Heathrow charges retailers a nominal rent but takes a cut of their turnover. Last year, Heathrow made \u00a3542m from retail, according to its annual report, compared with \u00a3329m in 2008. Over at Gatwick, a new shopping area in the South Terminal cost \u00a321m. Here, around 70% of passengers are British holidaymakers rather than businesspeople, and the stores reflect that difference. Instead of the Burberrys or Mulberrys, there are popular high-street brands including Zara, SuperDry and Ted Baker. Spencer Sheen, head of retail at Gatwick, says: \"There was underinvestment in the past, and there was pent-up demand from passengers who wanted to start enjoying themselves once they got through security.\" Ray Kelvin, chief executive of Ted Baker, says that its airport stores \u2013 in Glasgow and Stansted as well as Gatwick \u2013 had served the business well: \"It has helped us to export our brand internationally, as well as servicing the British traveller on last-minute purchases before going on a vacation.\" Julian Dunkerton, chief executive of SuperDry, agrees: \"We've just opened at Gatwick North and it's going really well. We're a perfect match for airport crowds with people wanting last minute items before they get away.\"",

    "webTitle": "Why the 'dash for gas' has got off to a false start", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For all the talk of a dash for gas, the government-backed race for a new generation of power stations has had few willing participants thus far. So the suggestion last week by the chief executive of Drax, the UK's biggest coal-fired power station, that she might invest in new gas plants was a surprise. Nonetheless, her words were hedged with a caution shared by the rest of the energy industry. \"We could start to look at it. But it would depend very much on the details of the government's energy market reforms,\" said Dorothy Thompson. But even with the caveats, this was the biggest expression of enthusiasm for new gas power that the UK has seen in some time. The government is desperate to bring new gas-fired energy generation on stream, as a way of avoiding shortfalls in electricity supply when ageing coal and nuclear power stations are taken out of service. But there is a marked absence of building projects and a distinct chill where new investment is concerned. At least 14GW of new gas-fired power stations have received planning consent, according to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. So in theory construction work on this new dawn of gas power could start immediately. But there is only one such station being built \u2013 the 800MW Carrington plant in Manchester, owned by Irish utility ESB \u2013 and none of the big companies have active plans to begin work on any others. Centrica, owner of British Gas, confirmed last week that its plans for a site in King's Lynn were still on hold. Scottish and Southern Energy made a pointed reference to the government's electricity market reform, which aims to ensure that there is enough investment in power generation to avoid blackouts, while meeting 2050 greenhouse-gas targets. On top of that, electricity supply must be cost effective, even though a key part of government energy policy is the so-called capacity mechanism, which will put gas-powered plants on standby to fill gaps in solar and wind-powered electricity supply. SSE said: \"Although projects such as Abernedd are close to being 'shovel-ready' and others such as Keadby 2 are at an advanced stage of development, unless there is a significant change in UK government policy around EMR [electricity market reform] and the timing and operation of a future capacity mechanism, and clear market signals suggesting the need for increased gas-fired generation capacity, SSE does not expect to take any final investment decisions to construct these projects until at least 2015. This will effectively mean no new capacity will come into operation until 2017/18 at the earliest, given the lead times for constructing new CCGT plant.\" RWE npower said it had applied for a permit at its Willington site, but that this was \"in the very very early stages\". The mismatch between the government's aspirations and the industry's actions is growing larger. Ministers need to show progress by the next general election if their energy strategy is to have any credibility. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, told the Guardian last year he wanted at least 20 new gas-powered plants, while some estimates predict a need for about 30 sites. Gas is viewed as a key back-up for renewable energy, as \u2013 unlike nuclear \u2013 it can be turned on relatively quickly if demand spikes and it is much greener than coal. The prospect of an indigenous gas source from shale has also been touted by ministers. Another key advantage, from the coalition's point of view, is that gas stations can be constructed relatively quickly, taking about two to three years and costing about \u00a31bn each. With energy chiefs citing the danger of power shortages in years, gas could be used to plug the gap. So why aren't companies following the government's script? Part of the reticence is down to the government itself. Investors are waiting to see how the capacity market, or those power plants designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs in low-carbon generation, will work in practice. One energy executive said: \"We are like everyone else in this industry \u2013 waiting to see the details of what the government comes up with and whether it works.\" But, more worryingly for the government, the economics of gas are also unattractive. \"No one is making money on gas,\" said another industry insider. \"The margins are so thin. Coal is making piles of money.\" Peter Atherton, energy analyst at Liberum, said companies also faced the prospect of building plants that would be running at only a fraction of their capacity for most of their 25-year lives, in order to meet the government's carbon budgets in the 2020s and 2030s. Plants could end up operating at only 20% of capacity, or being kept on standby to be used only during the winter peak, he said. That, together with poor economics of gas at present, added up to \"far too much risk\" for investors, he said. \"The attractiveness of gas has gone from being a small positive to a massive negative.\" Energy UK, which represents the energy industry, said companies would need further reassurance from government and better market conditions. A spokeswoman said: \"People need to have confidence to build any form of major project and, when it comes to gas power stations, continued uncertainty weakens market signals and undermines confidence that new investments will make a profit. Gas is also more expensive than coal and carbon which are currently very cheap.\" The department of energy said that it was for private sector investors to make their own decisions on infrastructure investments. \"It is a commercial decision for the applicant to decide whether or not to proceed with the proposed project.\"",

      "bodyText": "The most dangerous chancellor of my career, one George Osborne \u2013 Jeffrey to President Obama \u2013 tells us the economy is \"on the mend\". I, too, am on the mend. The difference is that the fracture to my shoulder was the result of an accident, whereas the austerity policy was no accident, but deliberately inflicted on an economy that had been gently recovering from the financial crisis. I repeat, from the financial crisis, not a fiscal crisis. The coalition, egged on, alas, by the Bank of England, made two egregious errors of judgment in 2010. In the chancellor's case, these errors were encouraged by a cynical political calculation related to the electoral timetable. In the Bank of England's case, quite apart from its errors of judgment about the nature of the crisis, there was the additional question of whether a body that had been granted independence in monetary policy should have been interfering in fiscal policy. The first error was to compare the British economic situation to that of Greece. I have found during my travels that even lay people who had no idea of the strength of the British position as an international borrower \u2013 an average maturity on our national debt of 14 years, not 14 weeks \u2013 found comparisons to Greece risible. The second error was to accept the view that, before the onset of the financial crisis, the British fiscal position was out of control. It has to be conceded, however, that the coalition's judgment that it could fool a lot of the people a lot of the time with this blatant misrepresentation was all too shrewd. In which context I strongly recommend the spring issue of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy. It covers the economic record of the 1997-2010 Labour government in considerable and balanced detail, warts and all. The chapter of particular relevance to the austerity policy is the one by the economist Simon Wren-Lewis, who is widely respected in the profession, and who played a notable role in the famous \"five tests\" study published in 2003 \u2013 which ended in the conclusion that Britain should not join the eurozone. Wren-Lewis finds that fiscal policy (taxation and spending) was actually too tight in the early years of that administration, overcompensated in the middle period, and failed to correct sufficiently in the final years. But in the face of the great recession, the supposed benefits of tighter policy in the latter years would have been small: \"The debt-to-GDP ratio in 2007 was lower than its level in 1997, and the net borrowing requirement was fairly close to a neutral 2% deficit, so it cannot be said that fiscal policy was seriously deficient over this period.\" Wren-Lewis concludes that, with the onset of the recession, \"the Labour government had two key fiscal decisions to make: by how much, and by what means, to try and stimulate the economy \u2026 and how quickly to plan to correct the deficit caused by the recession and any countercyclical action it took \u2026 my own view is that the government was absolutely right to try to use fiscal policy to mitigate the impact of the recession, and it was also right to plan to correct the deficit relatively slowly.\" This rigorous academic observes that is it is unfortunate, but hardly surprising, that the Labour record of this time has become highly politicised. \"The line that the Labour government was responsible for leaving a disastrous fiscal position which requires great national sacrifice to put right is pure spin,\" he says. Unfortunately, it was not just the British government that made the wrong diagnosis and chose the wrong policy after the crisis. Alas, most of continental Europe chose, or in many cases was forced, to go down the blind alley of austerity. Jack Lew, the relatively new US treasury secretary, wrote recently in the Financial Times: \"While long-term fiscal policy requires tough decisions, we knew we could not cut our way to prosperity.\" This highlights the difference between the UK/eurozone approach and that of the US. Again, as Lew says: \"To remain on the path of continued growth, we need to avoid self-inflicted wounds while we are still trying to make up lost ground.\" Lew has now taken up the baton from Gordon Brown when it comes to politicians who understand the nature of the huge deficiency of demand in the world economy. People go on about the need for supply-side policies, but the fact is that there is no shortage of supply, but of demand, which continues to be constrained by the vogue for totally unnecessary and hugely destructive policies of austerity. The wonderful summer weather has lifted the spirits, and there have been minor improvements in economic performance and the outlook for both the UK and the eurozone. But we cannot rely indefinitely on Mario Draghi (the president of the European Central Bank) and his promise to do \"whatever it takes\" to save the situation \u2026 The crucial part of Draghi's statement that people ignored was the second half: \"within our mandate\". The ECB's mandate is far too deflationary. The irony is that, outside the eurozone, we are not bound by that mandate. What we have been bound by is the misjudgment of our policymakers.",
