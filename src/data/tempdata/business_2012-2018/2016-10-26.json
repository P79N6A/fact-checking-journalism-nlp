      "bodyText": "A report by the Community Council of Australia has shattered perceptions that Australia is a country of the \u201cfair go\u201d, finding it is less fair, less safe, and with a higher incarceration rate than comparable OECD nations. The Australia We Want report was released on Thursday before a National Press Club address by the council\u2019s chairman and World Vision Australia\u2019s chief executive, Tim Costello. It paints a damning picture of a society characterised by rising inequality, rising suicide rates and above-average carbon emissions. The report\u2019s author, the Community Council of Australia\u2019s chief executive, David Crosbie, said he was \u201cshocked\u201d that Australia rated so poorly against other developed countries. The national incarceration rate increased by 6% to 196 people for every 100,000 in 2015, higher than any country in western Europe. In the Northern Territory imprisonment rates are four times the national average, at 885 for every 100,000, and higher than the rate of imprisonment in the US. The Indigenous incarceration rate was 15 times the national rate, at 2,253 for every 100,000 in 2015. \u201cIncarceration rates are like the canary in the coalmine, they tell you how your most vulnerable are being treated,\u201d Crosbie told Guardian Australia. He said it was disingenuous to suggest imprisonment rate was connected to crime, because only 25% of prisoners had been convicted of a violent offence. In 2015 almost 10,000 prisoners had not been convicted at all and were on remand awaiting court dates. \u201cThe incarceration rates are entirely a product of policy we implemented and enacted,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not an accident.\u201d Crosbie compared the report to a credit rating delivered by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s which sought to take a picture of the health of the economy by considering a range of interconnected indicators. It set a baseline for community organisations to work against in order to enact what a group of 60 not-for-profit organisations set as the core values of Australian society. \u201cI think if we start saying we believe these things \u2026 then we need to work to make sure that we achieve them,\u201d he said. Crosbie suggested the mantra of \u201cbudget repair\u201d had become harmful to the overall health of Australian society because it promoted and rewarded individual economic gain at the cost of a connected, resilient society. Suicide rates in Victoria, the Northern Territory and South Australia increased by more than 20% last year, which Crosbie said should be considered a \u201ccrisis\u201d. \u201cIf 300 extra people had been killed by terrorism we would do what it took, whatever it cost, to stop it,\u201d he said. The national suicide rate is 12 deaths for every 100,000 people, or 7.8 deaths by suicide a day. But the indicator Crosbie was most surprised by was perceptions of safety: only 48% of Australian women said they felt safe walking alone at night, significantly lower than the OECD average of 60.6%. Australian men, in comparison, felt safer than the OECD average, with 76% reporting they felt safe at night. Crosbie said Australians had traditionally expected government to deliver change in social policy areas but \u201cthat has been a bit lost over the last six years because the capacity of government to fix things has been lost due to instability\u201d. \u201cI think our faith in the ability of government to deliver a substantial agenda and make a difference over time has been significantly damaged,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of faith that if the government said it wanted to reduce suicide rates that it would go about it in a way that would actually reduce suicide rates.\u201d Costello said the report was an opportunity to \u201cimagine an Australia where incarceration rates are actually falling, where the suicide rate is less than the road toll and where your postcode doesn\u2019t define your chance of getting an education or a job\u201d. He called on businesses, individuals and not-for-profit organisations to be \u201cmore than passengers in an economy,\u201d saying: \u201cWe must build the Australia we want.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The City regulator has said it is keeping a close watch on algorithmic traders of the type that may have been connected with the flash crash in the pound earlier this month. Sterling plunged in a few minutes of early trading in Asia on 7 October, prompting the Bank of England to say it was looking into possible causes of the sudden movement. On Wednesday, a senior official at the Financial Conduct Authority was asked how it regulated algorithmic trading \u2013 computers programmed to take bets on markets. Megan Butler, director of supervision at the City regulator, said: \u201cOur approach is to recognise that a poorly designed, poorly controlled, inappropriately used algo[rithm] can have a very significant impact on proper operation of the market.\u201d Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, said the use of such trading systems had been discussed with companies in the City in the run-up to the EU referendum on 23 June. Bailey, who took over at the FCA in July after a long career at the Bank, was setting out his \u201cmission\u201d for the regulator as he pledged to clean up the behaviour of major financial companies after a \u201cvery sorry\u201d history of scandals. There had been two financial crises in the past decade, he said, the first about the strength of the banking industry, which called into question \u201cour financial stability at the level of the whole system\u201d. \u201cThe second crisis has involved the conduct of business by financial firms,\u201d he said, highlighting the mis-selling of payment protection insurance to individuals and interest rate swaps to businesses, the rigging of the Libor rate and foreign exchange markets, as well as breaches of money laundering rules. \u201cThis is a very sorry history and the future needs to be radically different from the past. We owe this to the public, who are the consumers of financial services,\u201d said Bailey, as he launched a consultation on the regulator\u2019s mission. His appointment followed the decision by the then chancellor, George Osborne, not to renew the contract of Martin Wheatley, the first head of the FCA when it was set up after the financial crisis. When the regulator was launched, Wheatley said he would \u201cshoot first and ask questions later\u201d. But Bailey said he was not steering the FCA towards a different approach around regulating City firms. \u201cI should also point out that this is not a document about Brexit. In fact, that is the only time the word appears in the document. \u201cThis is because we believe that the issues we are setting out in the mission are at the heart of financial conduct regulation, whatever we do next,\u201d he said.. In a speech to a City audience later on Wednesday, he said any attempt to water down the rules put in place since the financial crisis should be resisted. \u201cWe should not now start to regret the policies that are in place, but remember the scale of the crisis and what has been avoided,\u201d Bailey said. Earlier this week, a report by the thinktank New City Agenda, which Bailey described as disappointing, warned that regulations were being scaled back. Bailey was speaking alongside his successor at the Bank, the deputy governor Sam Woods, who told guests at Mansion House that banks needed to make sure their business models could cope with extra regulation and the low interest rate environment. \u201cThis is a first-order issue for us,\u201d said Woods, who is the chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority. \u201cFirms need to review their business models for the new world,\u201d said Woods, indicating that rules would continue to be implemented despite the Brexit vote.",

    "webTitle": "Goldman Sachs: in the headlines despite its renowned discretion", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs featured prominently in the headlines this year, even before the leak this week of Theresa May\u2019s pre-EU referendum speech to staff at the investment bank. The New York-based bank has been dragged into the BHS scandal, the bitter run-up to the US presidential election and the furore over the appointment of the former European commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso as chairman of Goldman Sachs International. The high court in London also heard allegations in June that Goldman bankers paid for prostitutes, private jets and five-star hotels, and held meetings on yachts to win business from a Libyan investment fund set up under the Gaddafi regime. These allegations were part of a $1.2bn claim against Goldman by the Libyan Investment Authority, which said the bank duped it into signing deals it did not understand. The high court ruled in Goldman\u2019s favour this month. The prime minister spoke in May at the investment bank\u2019s \u201cTalks at GS\u201d series. The list of past speakers at these Goldman Sachs events has highlighted the company\u2019s allure and influence in London and other financial centres around the world. According to Goldman\u2019s website, the \u201cTalks at GS\u201d involve the bank inviting \u201cleading thinkers from a broad range of backgrounds to share their views and expertise\u201d. As well as May, who spoke at Goldman on 26 May, other speakers have included Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue, Eddie Jones, the England rugby union coach, and Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury. The investment bank is not the biggest in the world (that title belongs to JP Morgan Chase based on their respective stock market values) but Goldman consistently tops the global league table for the number of mergers and acquisitions it has worked on, and its alumni have ended up in some of the most powerful jobs in the world. It was infamously described by Rolling Stone magazine in 2010 as a \u201cgreat vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money\u201d. Former Goldman employees who have moved on to high-profile positions in public life include Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, Hank Paulson, the former US treasury secretary, and Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister. In the UK, Jim O\u2019Neill, the former chief economist of Goldman Sachs, had been a Treasury minister in the Conservative government until his resignation last month, while Paul Deighton, the former chief operating officer in Europe, was commercial secretary to the Treasury under George Osborne and has just been named chairman of Heathrow airport. Howard Wheeldon, a veteran analyst in the City, claimed Goldman was perceived as a \u201ccut above the rest\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is informed and always one step ahead of its peers, quiet and yet super efficient, influential because it creates knowledge required, always up with events and yet, by the same token, invisible to its peers. There simply is no one better \u2013 the Rolls-Royce of global investment banking.\u201d Another City source said there was a business adage that \u201cno one ever got fired for hiring Goldman Sachs\u201d. Goldman is renowned for its discretion and secrecy, appreciated by wealthy clients looking for someone to manage their money or a company working on a big acquisition. So the bank will have been disappointed to find its name in the news in relation to the British prime minister, particularly because the story was leaked from within the bank and involved a secret event held behind closed doors. A spokesman for Goldman declined to comment when asked if the company was investigating the source of the leak. The bank was involved in a similar controversy with Hillary Clinton this year after it emerged the US Democratic presidential candidate was paid $675,000 for speeches to Goldman employees and clients. Clinton did not reveal the details of her speeches, but WikiLeaks released transcripts in October that showed she had avoided directly criticising Wall Street. Two of Goldman\u2019s most senior employees in Europe \u2013 Michael Sherwood and Anthony Gutman \u2013 were also summoned before MPs in June as part of a parliamentary investigation into the demise of the retailer BHS. Goldman had offered informal advice to Sir Philip Green before he sold BHS to Dominic Chappell.

Sherwood and Gutman found the public hearing and inquiries into Goldman\u2019s business practices awkward. At one stage, Michelle Thomson, the SNP MP, even said: \u201cMr Sherwood, I have been keeping quiet to this point, but I have been sitting watching everyone\u2019s faces and, if you don\u2019t mind my saying, you look somewhat uncomfortable.\u201d But the parliamentary appearance of two senior Goldman figures also provided a unique insight into how the investment bank does business, including its determination to stay close to leading clients. \u201cGoldman Sachs is slightly different from other firms,\u201d Sherwood told MPs. \u201cOur starting account size is larger and we are really in the high net worth business and that is all. We are in the business where we cover large corporations, high net worth individuals, governments. They may not do things for a very long period of time, but, at particular times in their lifecycle, they might do significant transactions and we want to be in the goalmouth when those things happen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The revival in the oil price has proved short lived, as doubts over producers agreeing to curb output at next month\u2019s Opec meeting began to outweigh the news of a surprise drop in US crude stocks. So Brent crude is currently down 1.3% at $50.13 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 0.9% lower at $49.47. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. A fall in commodity shares along with the usual concerns about Brexit and the US election, along with some disappointing results from the likes of Apple, have left most European markets nursing losses. However a revival in the oil price after a surprise drop in US crude stocks saw Wall Street reverse earlier falls and drag European shares off their worst levels. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 59.55 points or 0.85% at 6958.09 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.44% to 10,709.68 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.14% lower at 4534.59 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.29% to 17,280.74 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.37% at 9173.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.09% to 589.46 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 53 points or 0.29%. With Wall Street turning positive in the wake of the oil price recovery, European markets are coming off their worst levels, albeit still down on the day. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: US markets continue to dictate the tone, as disappointing numbers from Apple weigh on sentiment, while investors keep a nervous eye on falling oil prices. While scepticism around the OPEC deal was palpable, no one really expected it to unravel this quickly, but a procession of nations bearing their own \u2018sick notes\u2019 as to why they couldn\u2019t possibly be expected to participate has shown that the unanimity on display recently was simply a front. In addition, sentiment has been hit by news that the Trump campaign for president may not be quite as DOA as previously thought. When combined with the disappointing numbers from Apple, it is clear to see why markets remain under pressure. At least oil prices have stabilised, with the weekly crude inventories providing their usual burst of volatility. The drop in stockpiles might provide some temporary relief, but overall if the OPEC deal continues to unravel then we could see the lows tested in short order. Oil prices have recovered some ground from earlier falls after a surprise fall in US crude stocks. Crude inventories dropped by 553,000m barrels last week to 468.16m, compared to expectations of a 4m barrel rise, according to the Energy Information Administration. So Brent crude, which had fallen as low as $49.65 a barrel on concerns that producers will not agree to curb output at next month\u2019s meeting, is now at $50.63, down 0.32%. West Texas Intermediate is now up 0.12% to $50.02 a barrel. The European Central Bank is likely to extend its QE programme beyond the current March end date, according to Reuters: The European Central Bank is nearly certain to continue buying bonds beyond its March target and to relax its constraints on the purchases to ensure it finds enough paper to buy, central bank sources have told Reuters. The moves will come in an attempt to bolster what is being heralded as the start of an economic recovery in the euro zone. ECB policymakers are due to decide in December on the future shape and duration of their 80 billion euros (\u00a371.58 billion) monthly quantitative easing (QE) scheme, based on new growth and inflation forecasts. They did not discuss specific options at last week\u2019s meeting and no policy proposal has been formulated. But sources familiar with the matter said it was all but sure that money printing would continue in some form beyond March, currently the ECB\u2019s earliest end-date. US new home sales have come in slightly better than expected, although there is some confusion in the figures. They rose to 593,000 units in September, up 3.1% from the August figure of 575,000, which was itself revised down from 609,000. This was lower than the 600,000 expected but given the revision, the rise itself was better than the forecast 1.5% fall. The US service sector grew more strongly than forecast in October, according to a report. The initial Markit US services PMI for this month came in at 54.8, up from the 52.3 expected and 52.3 in September. Markit\u2019s composite PMI, which includes services and manufacturing, rose from 52.3 in September to 54.9, the highest level since November 2015. Markit said the surveys suggested that the US economy was growing at an annualised rate of 2% at the start of the fourth quarter. Tim Moore, a senior economist at IHS Markit, said: The latest survey data reveal a decisive shift in growth momentum across the US service sector, which mirrors the more robust manufacturing performance seen during October. Service providers experienced the fastest upturn in new business volumes since late 2015, which survey respondents linked to improving domestic economic conditions and signs of greater business investment in particular. That said, job creation remained relatively subdued in October, with firms reporting cautious hiring plans and efforts to alleviate pressures on margins. October\u2019s survey findings contained positive signs for near-term growth prospects, with service sector companies the most upbeat about the business outlook since August 2015. Moreover, the month-to-month rise in this index was one of the largest seen over the past two years. The fall on Wall Street has helped push European markets lower, with the FTSE 100 dropping by 91 points (1.3%). Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.97% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 0.6%. The US stock market is dropping at the start of trading, following the UK\u2019s lead. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has shed 90 points, or 0.5%. Energy companies have slipped after the oil price hit a three-week low today. And Apple has fallen more than 3% after it posted falling sales and profits last night. Laura Hinton, the head of people at PwC, argues that bosses must proactively do more to address the gender pay gap. She says: It\u2019s encouraging to see the gender pay gap reducing, but the underlying reasons for the gap remain the same. Women are still more likely to work part time, have lower-paid jobs and leave the workforce after having children. Until we tackle these underlying causes, it will be hard to reach true equality in the workplace. In February, the government outlined plans to force large companies to reveal how much they pay their male and female staff, starting in 2018. Hinton says this has already worked at her company: At PwC, publishing our gender pay gap has allowed us to understand the reasons for the gap and helps hold ourselves accountable to make practical changes. For example, we know that when senior women leave us, they are more likely to be replaced by a male. We are challenging ourselves on this by testing our recruitment processes, making more senior jobs available as flexible or part time and targeting women who have been out of the workplace for a number of years via our return to work programme. The Resolution Foundation is playing a blinder today, and has created some more charts to show what\u2019s happening in Britain\u2019s labour market. This chart shows how the \u201cnational living wage\u201d has driven up earnings for customer service jobs above their pre-crisis level. Elementary occupations (unskilled jobs) are close behind. I was surprised by this chart, which shows that wages in London are the furthest from pre-crisis levels. And rising inflation is going to drive down real wages this year. A quick catchup on the other news today. Andrew Bailey, the head of the Financial Conduct Authority, has promised to clean up Britain\u2019s financial sector after a long run of scandals and misbehaviour. Vodafone has apologised after being fined \u00a34.6m for taking pay-as-you go customers\u2019 money without providing a service in return, and for flaws in its complaints handling processes. And a major new housebuilding project has been approved in Thamesmead, south-east London, at a site famous for staging A Clockwork Orange. It\u2019s not been a great morning in the City. The FTSE 100 has shed 68 points, nearly 1%, to 6,949. Mining stocks continue to struggle after copper company Antofagasta cut its production targets this morning. The FTSE is also catching up with last night\u2019s rally in the pound back to $1.22, which came after the London stock market closed. A stronger pound is bad for international companies that earn dollars. Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG, says the pound could spike ... if a legal challenge to Brexit is successful. The continuing legal hearing against the government\u2019s decision to view the referendum result as binding seems like the event risk no one is talking about. Should the legal challenge succeed, it would push the decision to a vote in parliament, bringing about a sharp appreciation in the pound and subsequent weakness for the FTSE. The oil price is also under pressure, with Brent crude dropping through the $50 a barrel mark for the first time in three weeks. City analyst Alberto Gallo of Algebris Investments points out that UK borrowing costs have been rising since the start of October, as the price of British gilts has dropped. This morning\u2019s warning that Britain faces an \u00a384bn budget shortfall over the next five years is rippling through the City, and beyond. The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year UK government debt has risen to 1.14%, up six basis points from 1.08% last night. That means the price of the bonds has fallen; traders may be anticipating that the government will have to issue much more debt over the next few years. George Eaton, political editor of the New Statesman, has written a good piece about chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s dilemma [riffing off the charts I posted earlier]. Here\u2019s a flavour: Were he to seek a current budget surplus, rather than an overall one (as Labour pledged at the last general election), Hammond would avoid the need for further austerity and give himself up to \u00a317bn of headroom. This would allow him to borrow for investment and to provide support for the \u201cjust managing\u201d families (as Theresa May calls them) who will be squeezed by the continuing benefits freeze. Alternatively, should Hammond merely delay Osborne\u2019s surplus target by a year (to 2020-21), he would be forced to impose an additional \u00a39bn of tax rises or spending cuts. Were he to reject any further fiscal tightening, a surplus would not be achieved until 2023-24 - too late to be politically relevant. The most logical option, as the Resolution Foundation concludes, is for Hammond to target a current surplus. But since entering office, both he and May have emphasised their continuing commitment to fiscal conservatism (\u201cHe talks about austerity \u2013 I call it living within our means,\u201d the latter told Jeremy Corbyn at her first PMQs). For Hammond to abandon the goal of the UK\u2019s first budget surplus since 2001-02 would be a defining moment. Hopefully, poorly paid people should get another boost this financial year as the national living wage pushes up salaries: Rupert Harrison, former advisor to former chancellor George Osborne, appears to feel vindicated by the news that Britain\u2019s lowest paid workers got a 6.2% pay rise last year (or 4% more than average) However.... that\u2019s still less, in cash terms, than a smaller pay rise on a much larger salary. And it\u2019s important to remember that today\u2019s report does not include self-employed workers, whose pay has been lagging behind. And here\u2019s where the money goes.... More gender gap detail from the ONS: Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s report into UK pay: Britain\u2019s gender pay pay varies, depending how many hours people work each week. For part time jobs, women actually get paid more on average than men. The ONS says: For jobs where the number of paid hours worked by an employee is between 10 and 30, more women work in these jobs and the gender pay gap is in favour of women. But the dial shifts the other way, once you look at full time jobs - where the gender pay gap is in favour of men. This chart shows how men get paid more for doing jobs that are predominantly done by men: And this tweet shows how men still dominate senior positions, and on the factory floor, while women do the majority of administrative and caring positions. The CBI, which represents Britain\u2019s bosses, says it welcomes the \u201cfurther progress\u201d in closing the gender pay gap. And they point out that it\u2019s illegal to pay women less than men for doing exactly the same job. The gap is caused by a wide range of factors, and there is a way to go to address it. But it\u2019s crucial it is not confused with unequal pay, which is already illegal. It\u2019s important that the Government and firms work together on approaches that really change outcomes, such as the availability of childcare, career progression and improved careers advice.\u201d The TUC is alarmed that full-time male workers earned 9.4% more than women last year, marginally down on 9.6% in 2015. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: \u201cThe full-time gender pay gap is closing at a snail\u2019s pace. At this rate, it will take decades for women to get paid the same as men. \u201cWe need a labour market that works better for women. This means helping mums get back into well-paid jobs after they have kids. And encouraging dads to take on more caring responsibilities. \u201cThe government should also scrap tribunal fees, which stop women getting justice from bad employers who have discriminated against them.\u201d New research from the World Economic Forum shows that O\u2019Grady is right to be worried. They\u2019ve calculated that, at current progress, the global gender pay gap won\u2019t be eradicated until the year 2186. Here are the most important charts from today\u2019s survey of UK hours and earnings. This shows how people who\u2019ve been in their job for at least 12 months enjoyed their biggest pay rise since the financial crisis in 2015: But, real income are still below their pre-crisis level, once you adjust for inflation. Today\u2019s report shows that setting minimum pay levels has a real impact on the lowest paid. Those at the bottom end of the distribution saw their pay rise by 6.2%, compared to 2.5% for the best paid 5%. And Britain still has a gender pay gap. The average full-time male earner receives almost \u00a3100 per week more than his female equivalent (\u00a3578 per week compared with \u00a3480). Newsflash: Wages in the UK have grown at their joint fastest rate since the financial crisis. That\u2019s the topline from the annual assessment of Britain\u2019s labour market, just released by the Office of National Statistics. They say: In April 2016 median gross weekly earnings for full-time employees were \u00a3539, up 2.2% from \u00a3527 in 2015. The 2.2% growth seen this year is the joint highest growth in earnings seen since the economic downturn in 2008 (matching that seen in 2013). Adjusted for inflation, weekly earnings increased by 1.9% compared with 2015. This repeats the trend seen in 2015, which exhibited the first increase since 2008, and is due to a combination of growth in average earnings and a low level of inflation at that time. Weekly earnings grew by 2.2% for full-time workers compared with 6.6% for part-time workers. And the gender pay gap narrowed, slightly. Women now earn 9.4% less than men, per hour, down from 9.6% in 2015. The ONS says: This is the lowest since the survey began in 1997, although the gap has changed relatively little over the last six years. Here are some more key points: There are also some interesting charts, which I\u2019ll post next... The PPI scandal is the gift that keeps on taking, if you\u2019re a long-suffering investors in Lloyds Banking Group. Lloyds shares have fallen by 3% this morning after the bank, partly owned by the taxpayer, revealed it has set aside another \u00a31bn to cover compensation claims from customers wrongly sold payment protection insurance. This takes Lloyd\u2019s total PPI bill to \u00a317bn, or nearly half the \u00a337bn set aside by the UK banking sector. Lloyds also reported that profits in the last quarter fell by 15%, but are 50% up over the year to date. CEO Antonio Horta Osorio said Lloyds hadn\u2019t suffered from the Brexit vote, although some businesses are holding back from new investments. And asked about his own future, following recent stories about his private life, Horta Osorio said: I am very happy at Lloyds. I like the team here and I like the strategy. The pound is calm this morning, trading around $1.219 against the US dollar. But UBS Wealth Management has warned that sterling could fall to between $1.10 and $1.20m \u201cif concerns over the future of the UK\u2019s trade relationships continue to dominate\u201d. But... if Britain recovers from the initial Brexit shock, the pound be worth $1.36 in a year\u2019s time. Geoffrey Yu, Head of the UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management, says: \u201cWe expect the UK economy to bear the brunt of Brexit uncertainty in the coming months, levelling out as we move further into next year. Though the pound should recover accordingly, we cannot underestimate the central role that politics has played in sterling\u2019s fate up until now. With the terms and conditions of the UK\u2019s future trade links still unclear it is too early to rule out further downside risks in sterling.\u201d Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The market got another dose of Brexit negativity this Wednesday morning, with the Resolution Foundation claiming that Britain faces a \u00a384 billion black hole in the next half a decade. Shares are dipping in early trading in London, as investors digest this gloomy assessment of Britain\u2019s public finances. The FTSE 100 index of top shares has dropped back through the 7,000 point mark, down 35 points or 0.5% at 6983. Mining shares are leading the fallers, after copper producer Antofagasta cut its production targets for 2016 and 2017. That could imply slower global growth; also bad news for Britain\u2019s fiscal position. You can read Resolution\u2019s report yourself, here: Pressing the reset button We shouldn\u2019t pin all the blame for Britain\u2019s deteriorating public finances on June\u2019s referendum. Resolution point out that the fiscal picture was already looking murky, before the public voted to leave the EU. They say: It\u2019s worth noting that not all of the deterioration is likely to reflect \u2018Brexit effects\u2019. Monthly public finance updates from the ONS suggest that the government had already veered off course before the June referendum, with tax receipts performing particular poorly. Indeed, given that most economic measures are yet to show any fall-out from the vote (Sterling being the obvious exception), it\u2019s reasonable to assume that much of the weakening in the latest (September) outturn figures would have existed even in the absence of Brexit. And of course we simply don\u2019t know what Brexit will mean, whether banks will leave the City (maybe...) or if the weak pound will trigger a manufacturing renaissance. How should Philip Hammond react to the deterioration in Britain\u2019s public finances? According to Resolution, the chancellor has two options. He could: Soften the target. Instead of trying to eliminate the deficit, he could just aim for a \u2018current budget balance\u2019, which would exclude borrowing for long-term investment. Delay the target. So, still aim to eliminate the deficit, but admit it\u2019s not going to happen by 2019-20. Softening the target would require borrowing an extra \u00a361bn over the next five years --- and crucially, that would be ON TOP of the \u00a384bn black hole. As Resolution puts it: Such an approach would have serious ramifications for how the government\u2019s approach to fiscal policy is viewed. This chart shows those two options in more detail: This \u00a384bn black hole isn\u2019t Philip Hammond\u2019s only headache. Resolution Foundation also believe the government will break its target of cutting the national debt as a share of national income. They predict: Rising debt as a proportion of GDP in 2017-18, breaking the secondary rule by around \u00a310 billion in that year. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Let\u2019s get the bad news out of the way first. Britain\u2019s new chancellor faces an \u00a384bn black hole over the next five years, as the Brexit vote takes a bite out of the public finances. The Resolution Foundation has calculated that the UK government is on track to borrow more each year, and take in less tax receipts, over the lifetime of the current parliament. With growth slowing, and tax revenues disappointing, Resolution sees the UK running up a deficit of \u00a313bn in 2019-20, rather than the \u00a310bn surplus predicted before the Eu referendum. That means finding more than \u00a380bn to plug the gap, as this tweet shows (the gap between the red and blue lines = \u00a384bn). Chancellor Philip Hammond has already suggested he will \u2018reset\u2019 fiscal policy in the autumn statement, in four weeks time. And Resolution Foundation chief economist Matt Whittaker suggests Hammond will have to abandon the government\u2019s goal of balancing the books this parliament, unless he fancies imposing significant extra tax rises or spending cuts. As Whittaker puts it: \u201cThe good news for Philip Hammond is that by softening his fiscal target he has significant political and economic room for manoeuvre. \u201cBut the trade-off for this approach is significantly higher borrowing in the coming years. The chancellor will need to decide if that is a price he is prepared to pay for adjusting to new economic times and setting out a direction for the new government.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: This may not reassure international investors, as they wonder whether to hold British financial assets. UK government debt, or gilts, could weaken if Hammond is forced to tap the markets for tens of billions of extra debt to cover this black hole. No wonder that Theresa May was very concerned that Brexit would hurt Britain\u2019s economy (our front page scoop today), in the run-up to the vote: Also coming up today... Two of Britain\u2019s biggest companies are in the spotlight this morning, for the wrong reasons. Lloyds Banking Group is reporting results this morning, and revealing another \u00a31bn provision to cover the cost of the PPI (payment protection insurance) scandal And Vodafone is just been hit with a \u00a34.6m fine for customer failings. We\u2019ll have more on both those stories shortly. At 9.30am the Office for National Statistics publishes its annual survey of hours and earnings in the UK. That should give new insight into Britain\u2019s labour market, and the pay gender gap. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

This would allow him to borrow for investment and to provide support for the \u201cjust managing\u201d families (as Theresa May calls them) who will be squeezed by the continuing benefits freeze.</p> <p>Alternatively, should Hammond merely delay Osborne\u2019s surplus target by a year (to 2020-21), he would be forced to impose an additional \u00a39bn of tax rises or spending cuts. Were he to reject any further fiscal tightening, a surplus would not be achieved until 2023-24 - too late to be politically relevant. </p> <p>The most logical option, as the Resolution Foundation concludes, is for Hammond to target a current surplus.

      "bodyText": "The biggest windfarm operator in the UK is considering selling its oil and gas business, four decades after it was set up to manage Denmark\u2019s North Sea oilfields. Dong Energy, which is majority owned by the Danish government, said it had appointed JP Morgan to perform a strategy review that could result in the sale of the oil and gas business. Offloading oil assets would result in the company, whose initials stand for Danish Oil and Natural Gas, focus on wind power instead, completing its transformation from fossil fuels to renewables. Dong did not say whether selling its oil and gas operations would result in a change of name and added that it had yet to decide on the division\u2019s future. The company floated on the Copenhagen stock exchange this year, saying it would use the flow of cash from oil sales to fund ongoing investment in renewable energy projects. But on Wednesday, Dong said it might now look to raise funds more quickly by selling the division. Any sale could help it cement its position as the UK\u2019s leading exponent of wind power. Dong has stakes in windfarms that can produce more than 2.2GW in total, equivalent to about 4% of the UK\u2019s predicted peak demand of 52.7GW during cold weather. It has plans to add a further 1.5GW of wind power capacity, including the Hornsea 1 project 55 miles off the coast of Grimsby, which would be the world\u2019s largest offshore windfarm.",

      "bodyText": "The ousted chairman of Tata has issued an excoriating critique of the Indian conglomerate and its leadership as he accused the business of causing \u201cimmeasurable harm\u201d to his reputation. Cyrus Mistry hit back this week after Tata Sons, the corporation that owns Jaguar Land Rover and the Port Talbot steelworks, announced his departure with sources close to the firm citing a \u201clack of performance\u201d. His exit followed disagreements with Ratan Tata, a scion of Tata\u2019s founding family, who will take over as interim chairman until a successor is found. Now Mistry has lashed out at the company and its senior executives in a lengthy email to board members, some of whom were present at the meeting that ended his tenure. He said he was \u201cshocked beyond words\u201d at being axed: \u201cI cannot believe I was removed on grounds of non-performance. Apart from the invalidity and illegality of the business that was conducted, I have to say the the board of directors has not covered itself in with glory. \u201cTo \u2018replace\u2019 your chairman without so much as a word of explanation and without affording him an opportunity of defending himself in a summary manner must be unique in the annals of corporate history.\u201d He said he was writing to \u201cemphasise the total lack of corporate governance\u201d at the company, warning that the abrupt decision and lack of explanation had \u201cdone my reputation and the reputation of the Tata Group immeasurable harm. All this does not augur well for the future of the group.\u201d The acrimonious nature of Mistry\u2019s departure could herald future clashes because the Mistry family has an 18.4% stake in Tata Sons, the largest shareholding not held by the Tata family. Mistry expressed his concern that a string of Tata businesses, including Port Talbot steelworks owner Tata Steel Europe, were likely to see their notional value slashed by $18bn (\u00a314.7bn). \u201cA realistic assessment of the fair value of these businesses could potentially result in a writedown over time of about Rs 118,000 crores ($18bn),\u201d he said. Mistry has been at the heart of negotiations with the German company ThyssenKrupp about merging their European steel operations, raising doubts about the impact his departure will have on the future of the Port Talbot site in Wales. Tata is also in talks with the UK government about financial support for Tata Steel UK, which employs 11,000 people, and a restructuring of the unit\u2019s pension scheme. Tata has warned that Tata Steel UK will be included in a deal with ThyssenKrupp only if talks with the government are constructive. Mistry reserved particular criticism for Ratan Tata, highlighting the appetite for expansion of the man he took over from in 2012 and citing plans for a partnership with Malaysia-based airline Air Asia as evidence. \u201cEarly into my tenure, our foray into the aviation sector began when Mr Tata ushered me into his office and handed me a report on Air Asia,\u201d he said. He claimed Tata wanted to forge a partnership with Air Asia, something to which Mistry strongly objected. \u201cMy pushback was hard but futile.\u201d Mistry concluded by saying he had been forced into the position of a \u201clame duck\u201d chairman. \u201cWhile I would be lying if I said I am not disappointed, I have a sense of pride and dignity intact in the efforts I have taken to professionalise and institutionalise, regardless of the outcome if effort, I now witness.\u201d Analysts and investors in India were shocked by the sudden schism in the company. Tata has become renowned for long-term continuity and stability, with Ratan Tata spending more than two decades as chairman before making way for Mistry. In a brief statement, the Mumbai-based Tata said on Monday that Mistry was stepping down after a \u201cdecision was taken at a board meeting held here today\u201d. But the 148-year-old company, which makes a range of products, from cars to Tetley tea, gave no public reason for the surprise departure of Mistry after four years in charge. Tata said its committee would aim to find a new chairman within four months. It also issued a rallying cry from Ratan Tata, urging the group\u2019s various units \u201cto act as leaders in their respective markets and enhance returns to shareholders\u201d. \u201cThe companies must focus on their market position vis-a-vis competition, and not compare themselves to their own past. The drive must be on leadership rather than to follow,\u201d said Ratan Tata.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group has taken another \u00a31bn hit for payment protection insurance, in a move it hopes will cap its bill for the mis-selling scandal at \u00a317bn. The fallout has cost the industry has already reached \u00a337bn and looks likely to rise further in the coming days when other high street banks could add to their existing provisions for mis-selling the insurance product. George Culmer, Lloyds\u2019 finance director, said the \u00a31bn top-up should be the last \u201cbig\u201d addition to the bank\u2019s PPI bill and was driven by the decision by the Financial Conduct Authority to set a deadline of June 2019 \u2013 rather than spring 2018 \u2013 for claims. Lloyds has incurred the largest single bill for the scandal as it also owns HBOS, which it took over during the 2008 banking crisis. The charge for PPI was revealed as the bank reported its profits for the first nine of months of the year, which were 50% higher at \u00a33.2bn despite the PPI charge. In the third quarter, however, profits were down 15% at \u00a3811m. Listed among the charges taken by the bank was another provision of \u00a3150m for packaged accounts, where products such as travel insurance and roadside assistance policies are bundled up alongside current accounts. The taxpayer still owns a 9% stake in Lloyds \u2013 down from 43% at the time of the financial crisis \u2013 and the slump in its shares has forced chancellor Philip Hammond to abandon a plan to sell shares to the public at the discount. Instead Hammond has signalled that the remaining shares will be sold to City investors on the stock market. The shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, down about 2.5%, but regained their losses as analysts digested the implications for the bank returning cash to shareholders next year. The shares are still well below the 73.6p average price at which taxpayers bought them during the crisis. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the chief executive, who in August apologised to staff for the hit to the bank\u2019s reputation because of revelations about his private life, said the sale of the remaining stake would not be his cue to leave. \u201cI am very happy at Lloyds. I \u2026 like the team here and I like the strategy,\u201d said Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who took the helm in 2011 and immediately began the process of PPI payouts. Lloyds started with a \u00a33.2bn provision, which at the time was thought to have been enough to tackle the compensation payouts. He said: \u201cThe hard work undertaken in the last five years to transform and simplify the business has allowed the UK government to sell most of its stake in the group, returning \u00a317bn including dividends on its original \u00a320bn investment. We welcome the recent decision to recommence the sale of its shares.\u201d Since the rescue of HBOS approximately 45,000 jobs have been axed, and Horta-Os\u00f3rio would not be drawn on any further cost-cutting programmes as he said 60% of transactions with the bank could be conducted digitally. Lloyds is the first major bank to report its third quarter results, which cover the period since the Brexit vote, and Horta-Os\u00f3rio played down the impact on consumers, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t see any change in consumer trends.\u201dBut, he said, with small business customers \u201cthere has been some impact on businesses holding back on investment\u201d. The bank also said its pension scheme had turned from a \u00a3430m surplus deficit of \u00a3740m as as a result of the plunge in bond yields caused by the low interest rate environment. Culmer said there was no need for immediate action to cut the deficit. Analysts were watching for signals about the size of dividends to shareholders. Gary Greenwood, at Shore Capital, said there was potential for payouts. \u201cThe real highlight is a much stronger than expected capital generation, which means that management has reiterated its guidance for the group to deliver full-year pre-dividend capital generation equivalent to 1.6% of risk-weighted assets \u2013 around \u00a33.6bn or 5p per share \u2013 for the year as a whole,\u201d he said. Horta-Os\u00f3rio also reiterated remarks he made shortly after the EU referendum, hinting that Hammond should announce more spending on infrastructure in next month\u2019s autumn statement. \u201cWe strongly believe the economy requires a fiscal stimulus in terms of infrastructure and housebuilding. Interest rates have never been so low,\u201d the Lloyds boss said.",

We welcome the recent decision to recommence the sale of its shares.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n<p>Since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/lloyds-banking-group-accused-of-death-by-a-thousand-cuts-as-it-axes-1340-jobs\">the rescue of HBOS approximately 45,000 jobs have been axed, </a>and Horta-Os\u00f3rio would not be drawn on any further cost-cutting programmes as he said 60% of transactions with the bank could be conducted digitally.</p> \n<p>Lloyds is the first major bank to report its third quarter results, which cover the period since the Brexit vote, and Horta-Os\u00f3rio played down the impact on consumers, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t see any change in consumer trends.\u201dBut, he said, with small business customers \u201cthere has been some impact on businesses holding back on investment\u201d.</p> \n<p>The bank also said its pension scheme had turned from a \u00a3430m surplus deficit of \u00a3740m as as a result of the plunge in bond yields caused by the low interest rate environment. Culmer said there was no need for immediate action to cut the deficit. </p> \n<p>Analysts were watching for signals about the size of dividends to shareholders. Gary Greenwood, at Shore Capital, said there was potential for payouts.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe real highlight is a much stronger than expected capital generation, which means that management has reiterated its guidance for the group to deliver full-year pre-dividend capital generation equivalent to 1.6% of risk-weighted assets \u2013 around \u00a33.6bn or 5p per share \u2013 for the year as a whole,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Horta-Os\u00f3rio also reiterated remarks he made shortly after the EU referendum, hinting that Hammond should announce more spending on infrastructure in next month\u2019s autumn statement. </p> \n<p>\u201cWe strongly believe the economy requires a fiscal stimulus in terms of infrastructure and housebuilding. Interest rates have never been so low,\u201d the Lloyds boss said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline has reported better than expected quarterly results thanks to strong sales of its flu vaccine and a weaker pound. The UK\u2019s largest drug company has emerged as a big beneficiary from sterling\u2019s 18% decline since the Brexit vote. GSK generates 96% of its sales overseas but makes many products in the UK, including Sensodyne and Aquafresh toothpastes, at its Maidenhead factory. Sales rose by 23% to reach \u00a37.5bn in the third quarter. At constant exchange rates, sales were up 8% and earnings rose 12%. Analysts had forecast sales of \u00a37.3bn, according to Thomson Reuters estimates. Another area where GSK could benefit is \u201cparallel trade,\u201d which involves the shipment of drugs from low-cost countries such as Greece and Spain to countries such as Britain and Germany, where prices are higher. The outgoing chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, who will hand over to the company\u2019s consumer healthcare chief Emma Walmsley at the end of March, said parallel trade could \u201ccease in entirety,\u201d depending on the terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. There had been a decline in parallel trade since the referendum, he said, and \u201cif the pound remains suppressed or at these new lower levels, you would expect to see less import, more export\u201d. GSK\u2019s vaccine sales exceeded City expectations in the third quarter, in particular flu vaccines, while new HIV and lung medicines also sold well, offsetting declining demand for ageing blockbuster drugs such as Advair for asthma. Witty said the vaccine business had \u201cnever been healthier,\u201d despite the company\u2019s decision to withdraw its cervical cancer vaccine Cervarix from the US market. Shingrix, a new shingles vaccine which is seen as a potential blockbuster with annual sales of more than $1bn, has been filed for approval in the US and is due to be filed in the EU before the end of the year. Witty said after Walmsley\u2019s appointment a month ago, the \u201cfeedback from the overwhelming majority of shareholders has been positive and constructive\u201d. \u201cThat is the right response, given Emma\u2019s tremendous credentials for this role and her personal passion for GSK,\u201d he said. Walmsley will be the most powerful woman in the global drugs industry and one of seven female FTSE 100 chief executives. However, her appointment came as a disappointment to some investors who had hoped for the arrival of an outsider to push through a spin-off of the consumer healthcare arm. Witty said GSK was on track to achieve core earnings growth of 11-12% at constant exchange rates this year, marking a turnaround after several years of poor performance and a bribery scandal in China. He said the company saw no need to make any contingency plans around immigration after the Brexit vote. EU nationals account for 14% of GSK\u2019s UK based workforce. Witty was optimistic that \u201cultimately there are going to be some pragmatic decisions made\u201d that would ensure companies were able to attract global talent.",

      "bodyText": "The Peabody housing association has been given approval to build more than 1,500 homes in south-east London, revamping a 1970s concrete estate that served as the backdrop to A Clockwork Orange. The first residents are expected to move into the new homes in Thamesmead in 2019. Peabody\u2019s plans mark the first phase of a \u00a31.5bn regeneration programme, one of the biggest in Europe, which could deliver up to 20,000 new homes across 40 hectares (100 acres). The developing body owns 80% of the land. Thamesmead will be connected to central London by Crossrail, known as the Elizabeth line, from a rebuilt Abbey Wood station scheduled to open in December 2018. Up to 45% of the 1,500 new homes are expected to be affordable: a mix of social rent, shared ownership and intermediate market rent (set at about 80% of the market rental value of similar local properties). They range from one-bedroom flats to maisonettes and four-bedroom townhouses. Existing tenants will get a new home on the same tenure. Peabody\u2019s executive director for Thamesmead, John Lewis, said a \u201cbig hurdle was jumped\u201d when the plans were unanimously agreed by Bexley council\u2019s planning committee on Tuesday night. Existing residents had been consulted and the responses had been positive overall, he said. The project is Peabody\u2019s most ambitious to date. The housing association, one of the oldest in London, is preparing to begin construction next summer, with the final phase to be completed in 2024. Peabody will build 525 homes at Southmere village, 230 of which will be affordable, plus a library, cafes, restaurants and shops around a public square on the banks of Southmere Lake. About 1,000 more homes will follow at three other nearby sites, comprised of between 35% and 45% affordable and social housing. The average house price in the area is 44% of the London average. More than 40% of homes in Thamesmead are socially rented at present, more than double the average for England. \u201cAs well as creating much-needed quality new homes, the development will create thousands of new jobs and will attract new businesses too,\u201d Lewis said.",

      "bodyText": "Vodafone has been fined \u00a34.6m by Ofcom for \u201cserious and sustained\u201d breaches of consumer protection rules. It is the second-largest fine ever handed out by the regulator, after a \u00a35.7m penalty imposed on ITV in 2008 over the \u201cabuse\u201d of premium-rate phone lines in a number of hit shows. Ofcom carried out two investigations into the telecoms company. Vodafone was fined \u00a33.7m for taking pay-as-you go customers\u2019 money without providing a service in return; and \u00a3925,000 for flaws in its complaints handling processes. The penalties have to be paid to Ofcom within 20 working days. The money will be passed on to the Treasury. Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom\u2019s consumer group director, said: \u201cVodafone\u2019s failings were serious and unacceptable, and these fines send a clear warning to all telecoms companies. Phone services are a vital part of people\u2019s lives, and we expect all customers to be treated fairly and in good faith. We will not hesitate to investigate and fine those who break the rules.\u201d Vodafone apologised for its failings and said it had reimbursed all but 30 pay-as-you-go customers who could not be identified. The company made a donation of \u00a3100,000 to charity. The average refund per customer was \u00a314.35. \u201cWe deeply regret these system and process failures,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis has been an unhappy episode for all of us at Vodafone: we know we let our customers down. We are determined to put everything right \u2026 We offer our profound apologies to anyone affected by these errors.\u201d One Ofcom investigation found 10,452 pay-as-you-go customers lost out when Vodafone failed to credit their accounts after they paid to top up their mobile phone credit, after the company introduced a new billing system. Affected customers lost a combined \u00a3150,000 over a 17-month period between late 2013 and early 2015. Ofcom said Vodafone took action only after the regulator intervened. The billing chaos left many mobile users disconnected and out of pocket. Complaints about Vodafone\u2019s monthly contracts more than doubled last year, according to figures from Ombudsman Services, and are triple the industry average. Vodafone said the IT project was the largest it had undertaken and involved moving more than 28.5m customer accounts from seven billing platforms to the new system. A second investigation found that Vodafone failed to comply with rules on handling customer complaints. Ofcom said Vodafone\u2019s customer service agents were not given clear guidance on what constituted a complaint, while its processes were insufficient to ensure that all complaints were appropriately escalated or dealt with in a fair, timely manner. Vodafone also failed to ensure that customers were told, in writing, of their right to take an unresolved complaint to a third-party resolution scheme after eight weeks. The consumer organisation Which? said it was \u201cright that Ofcom has hit Vodafone with a hefty fine for such poor behaviour\u201d. Alex Neill, managing director of home and legal at the group, said: \u201cIt must swiftly address the issues repeatedly highlighted by its customers and the regulator, and introduce a complaints system that actually works.\u201d",

Vodafone was fined \u00a33.7m for taking pay-as-you go customers\u2019 money without providing a service in return; and \u00a3925,000 for flaws in its complaints handling processes. The penalties have to be paid to Ofcom within 20 working days. The money will be passed on to the Treasury.</p> <p>Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom\u2019s consumer group director, said: \u201cVodafone\u2019s failings were serious and unacceptable, and these fines send a clear warning to all telecoms companies. Phone services are a vital part of people\u2019s lives, and we expect all customers to be treated fairly and in good faith. We will not hesitate to investigate and fine those who break the rules.\u201d</p> <p>Vodafone apologised for its failings and said it had reimbursed all but 30 pay-as-you-go customers who could not be identified. The company made a donation of \u00a3100,000 to charity. The average refund per customer was \u00a314.35.</p> <p>\u201cWe deeply regret these system and process failures,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis has been an unhappy episode for all of us at Vodafone: we know we let our customers down.

Ofcom said Vodafone\u2019s customer service agents were not given clear guidance on what constituted a complaint, while its processes were insufficient to ensure that all complaints were appropriately escalated or dealt with in a fair, timely manner.</p> <p>Vodafone also failed to ensure that customers were told, in writing, of their right to take an unresolved complaint to a third-party resolution scheme after eight weeks.</p> <p>The consumer organisation Which? said it was \u201cright that Ofcom has hit Vodafone with a hefty fine for such poor behaviour\u201d.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "MPs have launched an inquiry into pay and working conditions in the UK to reflect growing concerns about the rise of casual employment, agency work and the informal gig economy. The business, energy and industrial strategy committee said it would investigate the rights of workers not permanently employed amid unease about exploitation as work becomes more precarious. MPs said the investigation was in response to revelations about conditions at Sports Direct and Asos and concerns about treatment of couriers and drivers at Uber, Hermes and Deliveroo. Ministers have ordered a crackdown on companies using large numbers of self-employed or agency workers after an investigation by the Guardian into low pay at the delivery company Hermes. After the Guardian\u2019s investigation into working conditions at Sports Direct, the committee produced a damning report into the retailer that condemned practices akin to a Victorian workhouse. Sports Direct highlighted wider concerns about the treatment of casual workers as the economy shifts from full-time employment. Iain Wright, the committee\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cIn our Sports Direct inquiry we exposed shocking examples of poor working practices, of agency workers paid less than the minimum wage and exploited through dubious voluntary schemes, such as pre-paid debit cards and deductions from pay for insurance services. \u201cIn recent months we\u2019ve seen growing evidence of agency workers and those working in the gig economy being exposed to poor working conditions. This growing trend raises questions over employment status and lack of worker rights.\u201d The inquiry raises the prospect of bosses of gig economy companies such as Hermes and Asos facing questions from MPs. Mike Ashley, Sports Direct\u2019s majority owner, and Sir Philip Green, the former owner of BHS, have undergone gruelling sessions before the committee. From drivers delivering packages to online shoppers to app-driven services such as Uber and Deliveroo, the gig economy, which has transformed delivery services, relies on large networks of self-employed contractors. Their status means they are not entitled to earn the \u201cnational living wage\u201d or receive benefits such as sickness and holiday pay. Unions have warned that a surge of people in self-employment demonstrates how workers are increasingly pressured to take up uncertain, low-paid employment as power has shifted from labour to employers after the long recession that followed the financial crisis. The committee said it would seek to establish the status and rights of agency and casual workers and the self-employed for the purposes of tax, benefits and employment law and how to protect them. Other subjects include treatment of and possible limits on the use of agency workers; which rights should apply to permanent and non-permanent staff; the use of zero-hours contracts; and enforcement of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d. Drivers for the taxi-app company Uber are waiting on an employment tribunal verdict, due on 28 October, on their claim that they should be classed as workers rather than as self-employed. Deliveroo, which delivers meals to people\u2019s homes from restaurants, backed down in August over changes to contracts for its drivers after weeks of protests. Wright said: \u201cThe nature of work is undoubtedly changing. It will change further with growing use of technology and a spreading of automation across the economy. \u201cThis might provide flexibility and choice for some people, but unleash insecurity and squeezed working conditions for others. With these economic and technological changes shaking up the world of work, it\u2019s vitally important that workers are protected.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "With Apple reporting its first fall in sales in 15 years, one of its suppliers has seen its shares come under pressure. Chip designer Imagination Technologies, which gets around half its revenues from the iPhone maker, is down nearly 2% at 235.75p after the overnight news from the US. Apple\u2019s revenues declined by 8% to $215.6bn (\u00a3177bn) while profits fell 14% to $45.7bn. But analysts at Liberum said Apple sold more iPhones in the fourth quarter than expected, and maintained the company\u2019s update was positive for Imagination: Apple sold 45.5m iPhones in its fourth quarter, higher than market expectations of 44m. The company said that demand is outstripping supply in the vast majority of places, particularly for the iPhone 7 Plus. Guidance for the December quarter is for $76bn to $78bn of revenue, broadly in-line with market expectations and flat year on year. Apple\u2019s share was down after results because of gross margin being guided down in the current quarter, with no revenue upside despite Samsung\u2019s issues. However, from Imagination\u2019s point of view these results and guidance is positive in our opinion. Strong third quarter iPhone shipments are positive, while the flattish December quarter guidance with supply shortages suggests that there is unlikely to be an inventory correction. This is likely to support higher royalties for Imagination from Apple in 2017.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares have fallen back, with some profit taking in mining shares and a slide in Lloyds Banking Group following its figures. Antofagasta is the biggest faller so far, down 40.5p at 500p after it said full year copper production would be at the lower end of its guidance and suggested it might reconsider a hydroelectric project at its Los Pelambres mine because of cost overruns. Other miners have given up some of their recent gains, with Anglo American down 21.5p at 1092.5p and BHP Billiton 22.5p lower at 1238.5p. A dip in the oil price on continuing doubts about whether production curbs can be agreed by Opec next month has also hit sentiment in the commodities sector. Meanwhile Lloyds Banking Group has lost 1.74p to 53.61p after it unveiled a fresh \u00a31bn provision for mis-selling payment protection insurance. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 63.37 points to 6954.27, not helped by new Brexit worries. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The market got another dose of Brexit negativity this Wednesday morning, with the Resolution Foundation claiming that Britain faces a \u00a384 billion black hole in the next half a decade. That report immediately dragged on the FTSE, which fell by 0.5% after the bell. The pound seemed slightly less effected by the news; against the dollar it saw flat, just below the 1.22 mark it slipped under yesterday, while against the euro it shed another 0.2%. The Resolution Foundation\u2019s warning wasn\u2019t all weighing on the UK index, however.... The FTSE was also dealing with the 3% slide seen by Lloyds following its third quarter report, with the bank revealing it had incurred another \u00a31 billion charge related to the mis-selling of PPI. Supermarkets were lifted by positive comments from Goldman Sachs, with Tesco up 1.6p at 211.75p and Sainsbury 1.7p better at 241.9p. Goldman also helped FirstGroup, up 1.7p to 106.5p, as it raised its target price from 146p to 168p. Elsewhere education group Pearson is down 5.5p at 741p following reports it is considering a disposal. Ian Whittaker at Liberum said: The Economic Times in India reports that Pearson is in talks to sell part or all of their online education company TutorVista. The article suggests that Pearson will have to sell the assets at a loss given there has been a revenue decline. Pearson has not commented but a sale of part or all of the business would raise further questions on Pearson\u2019s strategy, its M&amp;A track record and, probably less so, whether the sale is being used to raise cash.

A dip in the oil price on continuing doubts about whether production curbs can be agreed by Opec next month has also hit sentiment in the commodities sector.</p> <p>Meanwhile Lloyds Banking Group has lost 1.74p to 53.61p after<strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/26/llyods-hit-by-fresh-1bn-ppi-bill\"> it unveiled a fresh \u00a31bn provision for mis-selling payment protection insurance.</a></strong></p> <p>Overall the<strong> FTSE 100 </strong>has fallen 63.37 points to 6954.27, not helped by new Brexit worries. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The market got another dose of Brexit negativity this Wednesday morning, with <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/26/hammond-80bn-black-hole-economic-worsens-brexit-treasury\">the Resolution Foundation claiming that Britain faces a \u00a384 billion black hole in the next half a decade</a></strong>. </p> <p>That report immediately dragged on the FTSE, which fell by 0.5% after the bell. The pound seemed slightly less effected by the news; against the dollar it saw flat, just below the 1.22 mark it slipped under yesterday, while against the euro it shed another 0.2%.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation\u2019s warning wasn\u2019t all weighing on the UK index, however.... The FTSE was also dealing with the 3% slide seen by Lloyds following its third quarter report, with the bank revealing it had incurred another \u00a31 billion charge related to the mis-selling of PPI.</p> </blockquote> <p>Supermarkets were lifted by positive comments from Goldman Sachs, with<strong> Tesco</strong> up 1.6p at 211.75p and <strong>Sainsbury</strong> 1.7p better at 241.9p.</p> <p>Goldman also helped <strong>FirstGroup</strong>, up 1.7p to 106.5p, as it raised its target price from 146p to 168p.</p> <p>Elsewhere education group <strong>Pearson</strong> is down 5.5p at 741p following reports it is considering a disposal. Ian Whittaker at Liberum said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Economic Times in India reports that Pearson is in talks to sell part or all of their online education company TutorVista. The article suggests that Pearson will have to sell the assets at a loss given there has been a revenue decline. Pearson has not commented but a sale of part or all of the business would raise further questions on Pearson\u2019s strategy, its M&amp;A track record and, probably less so, whether the sale is being used to raise cash. Reiterate Sell. </p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "Underlying inflation has slipped again, from 0.5% in June to 0.4% in September, keeping alive the prospect of another interest rate cut. But economists are split over when that may be. Bureau of Statistics figures released on Wednesday show underlying inflation is growing at an annual rate of 1.7%. The Reserve Bank\u2019s target is 2-3%. \u201cIt gives the RBA an excuse to cut interest rates to 1.25% next Tuesday and we wouldn\u2019t rule this out\u201d, said a Capital Economics briefing note to clients. \u201cWe continue to expect the Reserve Bank to cut the cash rate to 1.25% at the November board meeting, although we hold this view without great conviction,\u201d Commonwealth Bank\u2019s chief economist, Michael Blythe, wrote in a note. The RBA governor, Philip Lowe, dedicated a speech last week to reasons why inflation was so low globally. He said low inflation and wages in Australia had seen a drop in inflation expectations among consumers and businesses, although not to unprecedented levels. The RBA board meets on Tuesday, Melbourne Cup day, to decide on interest rates. \u201cLooking to the future, we expect that the various factors holding inflation down will continue for a while yet,\u201d Lowe cautioned last week. \u201cBut this does not mean that we have drifted into a world of permanently lower inflation in Australia. \u201cThe experience elsewhere suggests that we do need to guard against inflation expectations falling too far, for if this were to occur it would be more difficult to achieve the inflation target.\u201d Blythe argued on Wednesday that inflation may have bottomed in Australia, for four reasons. He said the slowdown in inflation rates for services and non-tradeable goods appeared to have ended, while the proportion of consumer price index (CPI) categories that are recording price rises of less than 2% a year had stopped rising. He also said the categories of goods excluded from CPI were tracking sideways in annual growth terms, while a measure of \u201cstructural price\u201d growth had picked up recently. The RBA would have to juggle conflicting priorities and may decide to tolerate lower inflation, and for longer, for the good of the economy. \u201cA central bank concerned about low inflation and the risk to inflation expectations may certainly cut,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut a central bank worried about housing, debt and financial stability may leave interest rates alone.\u201d The ABS figures for headline inflation complicated the story. They showed a rise in the annual growth rate of headline inflation from 1% to 1.3% between the March and September quarters. Headline inflation is different from underlying inflation because its includes prices of goods that can be volatile. The rise in headline inflation to 1.3% was mainly due to a large 19.5% quarterly increase in the price of fruit and a 5.9% rise in the price of vegetables. The RBA is likely to look through those numbers because they reflect adverse weather conditions, including floods, in major growing areas, which affected supply. Other large price increases included electricity (up 5.4%) and tobacco (up 2.3%), which were partially offset by falls in communication (-2.3%) and fuel (-2.9%). Shane Oliver, AMP Capital\u2019s chief economist, said both headline and underlying inflation are in line with the RBA\u2019s inflation forecasts, and the rise in headline inflation may reduce the likelihood of inflation expectations deteriorating in the short term. For that reason, the RBA probably will not cut rates next week. \u201cThe RBA can afford to be patient in waiting for inflation to head back to target and thereby avoid the risk of adding to financial instability (read a further acceleration in Sydney and Melbourne home price gains) with another rate cut for now,\u201d he said.",
