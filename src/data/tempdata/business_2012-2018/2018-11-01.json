      "bodyText": "And finally.... Wall Street has closed higher, for the third day in a row. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 264 points to 25,380, up around 1%. That means it\u2019s put on over 900 points in the last three days - quite a bounceback. The S&amp;P 500 also gained just over 1%, while the tech stock revival left the Nasdaq 1.7% higher. Donald Trump\u2019s tweet citing progress in talks with China\u2019s president Xi over their trade conflict boosted morale in New York. Traders are also anticipating a good US jobs report tomorrow, while also hoping that the US Federal Reserve might see fit to ease up on interest rate hikes. On that note, goodnight! GW Back in New York, shares continue to recover from last month\u2019s losses. The Nasdaq is up 1.5%, as technology stocks such as chipmakers rebound. Brexit optimism, and the prospect of UK interest rate rises next year, are driving the pound higher and higher tonight. Sterling has gained more than two cents, a big move, against the US dollar to almost $1.30. This has slightly weighed on stocks, with the FTSE 100 dropping 13 points or 0.2% to 7,114. Heads-up, UK savers and borrowers. Richard Falkenh\u00e4ll, senior FX strategist at Nordic bank SEB, predicts two UK interest rate hikes in 2019 - possibly starting in just three months time. He says: With inflation staying above the target next year and the year after, and with a tight labour market, the BoE will continue with a slow tightening of policy with one or two hikes per year. We expect the next hike in May 2019, followed by one in November 2019. Falkenh\u00e4ll suspects the BoE is too optimistic about UK growth, but also reckons earnings growth could strengthen: There is uncertainty related to the domestic cost pressure in the UK where we believe inflation will fall back faster than the BoE projects. There are signs of accelerating wage growth and it will be important to see if this development continues. If wage growth accelerates further towards 3.5-4%, the next hike could be in February 2019, if there is a EU withdrawal deal in place.\u201d A group of top business leaders, academics, economists, entrepreneurs are meeting today at Number 10 Downing Street to tackle Britain\u2019s long-standing productivity crisis. The Industrial Strategy Council will oversee the government\u2019s efforts to boost innovation, improve the business environment, raise wages, enhance Britain\u2019s infrastructure networks, and play a key role in areas such as artificial intelligence and clean growth. It\u2019s a tough gig -- UK productivity has been a problem since at least the second world war, resisting a series of governments\u2019 efforts to raise output closer to Japanese or German levels. But the council, whose membership is being announced today, has a high-quality, experienced bench of talent (and gender-balanced, too). It will \u201chold the government to account\u201d, says business secretary Greg Clark, by producing success measures for the industrial strategy, and holding the government to account on them. Here\u2019s the full membership list: Andy Haldane (Chair) - Chief Economist, Bank of England Dame Kate Barker - Commissioner of the National Infrastructure Commission and recently Chair of the Industrial Strategy Commission. Emma Bridgewater - Founder of Emma Bridgewater Ceramics. Professor Diane Coyle - Bennett Professor of Public Policy at the University of Cambridge. Jayne-Anne Gadhia - Ex-Chief Executive, Virgin Money. Member of the Scottish Business Taskforce. Christine Gaskell - Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) Chair, Cheshire and Warrington. Rupert Harrison - Managing Director of BlackRock. Dame Vivian Hunt - Managing Partner UK and Ireland, McKinsey, Chair of CBI London Council. Dame Rotha Johnston \u2013 Chair of Northern Ireland Screen. Professor Juergen Maier - Chief Executive of Siemens plc. Sir Paul Marshall - Co-founder and Chairman, Marshall Wace LLP. Sir Charlie Mayfield - Chairman, John Lewis Partnership, Chair of Be the Business Lady Nicola Mendelsohn - Advertising executive; Vice-President for Europe, the Middle East and Africa for Facebook. Non-Executive Director of Diageo. Archie Norman - Chair, Marks &amp; Spencer. Formerly Chief Executive of Asda, Chair of ITV, McKinsey Consultant and Director at GEEST, Railtrack and Kingfisher. Hayley Parsons - Welsh entrepreneur and investor, and Founder of GoCompare Roy Rickhuss - General Secretary of Community and member of the Executive Council of the General Federation of Trade Unions and the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation. Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell - President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Manchester and Professor of Physiology, Co-chair of the Council for Science and Technology and past President of the Royal Society of Biology Professor Jennifer Rubin - Executive Chair of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), Professor of Public Policy at Kings College London Rohan Silva - Co-founder of Second Home, Senior Visiting Fellow at LSE Cities. Matthew Taylor - Chief Executive, Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA). Prime Minister Theresa May explains why the Strategy matters: \u201cOur modern Industrial Strategy is key to building a successful economy that works for everyone and creating high-quality jobs across the UK. \u201cThis Council gathers some of the most influential figures in business, academia, and civil society. Together, they will share their expertise and skills to measure the progress of our strategy and ensure it is boosting people\u2019s wages and improving productivity of British businesses.\u201d In other news, US president Donald Trump has claimed progress in the US-China trade wars. That has helped push shares up in Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average has gained 190 points (0.75%) in the first hour of trading. It\u2019s a little late for Halloween japes, but is Mark Carney really serious when he suggests the Bank of England could raise interest rates in a no-deal Brexit scenario? He\u2019s absolutely right that inflation could rise sharply if the pound slumps, and expensive tariffs are imposed on European goods. Also, if supply into the economy is squeezed (because goods can\u2019t get into the UK), new inflationary pressures would be created as consumers and businesses fought to get their hands on raw materials and finished goods. But in that situation, the economy would also be reeling from a serious shock. Businesses and households would need reassurance, not a painful interest rate hike to drive up the cost of credit. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reckons the Bank is trying to concentrate minds in Westminster and Brussels. He writes: The idea that the MPC would actually kick the economy on the way down is highly implausible. It is the equivalent of George Osborne saying before the referendum that there would be an emergency budget to raise taxes and cut spending by \u00a330bn in the event of a vote to Leave. But Osborne was trying to influence millions of voters: Mark Carney and his MPC colleagues are seeking to concentrate minds among a much smaller constituency: the policymakers negotiating a deal and the MPs who will eventually vote on it. Which is why Project Fear Mk II might just work. Ed Conway of Sky News isn\u2019t convinced either, saying: Consider what happened two years ago. The then-chancellor and the Bank warned before the referendum that interest rates might rise if the UK voted leave. Most economists and commentators, myself included, said that this seemed deeply implausible. Lo and behold, at the first practicable moment after the referendum the Bank cut interest rates. It even pumped an extra few tens of billions of pounds into the economy through quantitative easing. In short, it did precisely the opposite of what it warned about before the referendum. It is hard to conclude that the same working assumptions shouldn\u2019t apply this time around as well. The pound has continued to climb, and is on track for its best day since January. Sterling has risen as high as $1.293, up more than one and a half cents, on hope that the UK and EU are making progress. Mark Carney\u2019s comments about how the economy should pick up pace under a smooth Brexit is also helping: Mark Carney warns that a no-deal Brexit would put the UK into new territory. There\u2019s no real precedent for a big supply shock hitting a major advanced economy, in the era of inflation targeting, he points out. Q: Did you really tell the cabinet that the Chequers deal would allow the UK to claw back three-quarters of its lost output since the referendum? Governor Carney declines to comment on his recent briefing with cabinet ministers, but he does repeat that Chequers would be \u201cbetter than average\u201d. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Q: What exogenous risks could hurt the UK economy? Mark Carney say the Bank expects UK growth to fall below potential in the last three months of 2018, partly due to fluctuations in the data as Brexit looms. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent weight in, saying Britain\u2019s open economy makes it particularly susceptible to external jolts. The eurozone does look like it\u2019s growing slower than last year, Broadbent points out (growth halved to 0.2% in the last quarter). Back to Brexit.... Q: Is the prime minister\u2019s Chequers deal closer to WTO terms, or closer to a \u201cvery very close\u201d relationship with the EU, in terms of your forecasts? Chequers is closer to the latter than to the WTO scenario, says Carney -- in other words, it would be \u201cbetter\u201d than the Bank\u2019s current average forecast for the Brexit deal. But he cautions that nothing is agreed yet. It\u2019s government policy, it\u2019s a proposal, therefore there are certain things where Chequers is very clear and certain other things which are up for negotiation, he points out. Q: How confident are you in the financial sector\u2019s preparations for Brexit? Carney says he is confident that UK banks have taken appropriate steps to prepare for Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. But he indicates he is less confident with preparations by European banks, saying we need to move to \u201cactual legal certainty\u201d about how cross-border issues are handled after Brexit. This is a MASSIVE issue; there are literally trillions of euros of derivative contracts between banks in the City and the rest of the EU. A no-deal Brexit creates huge issues. Earlier this week, Brussels indicated that they would allow EU traders to use UK derivatives clearing services even if Britain crashes out of the EU without an exit deal. Those comments are welcome, Carney says, but it\u2019s not enough. Mark Carney gets a break from the barrage of Brexit bouncers, with a googly about central bank independence. Q: The US Federal Reserve is under pressure from Donald Trump not to tighten policy, while the European Central Bank has also been criticised by politicians over its stimulus plans. Does this concern you, and why is central bank independence important? The governor jokes that he\u2019s \u201cin favour\u201d of central bank independence, before explaining (at some length) that it underpins credibility. Households, businesses and the financial markets can have more confidence that the Bank of England will control inflation and protect financial stability, if it is both independent and accountable. That\u2019s particularly valuable at times when economies are at risk of sudden shocks. Q: Your report shows that wages are going up, but the savings ratio is going down, so are households spending every extra penny they get? Carney says that households have concerns about the general economic situation, but much less concern about their personal financial situation. There is \u201cclearly a range\u201d of possible Brexit outcomes, Carney continues with an expressive hand wave, particularly about the final end-state relationship. Q: Are you worried that the Bank could become a rule-taker if Britain and the EU agree a financial services deal based on equivalence (as was reported by The Times this morning). Carney declines to comment, but does point out that the government has downplayed that report. Q: Some pro-Brexit economists say a no-deal Brexit is nothing to fear - so why should people listen to the Bank of England instead? Carney reminds the press conference that the BoE correctly predicted the pound would slump if Leave won the 2016 referendum, and the knock-on impact on inflation and incomes. He adde that the Bank\u2019s forecasts are underpinned by its network of agents across the country, and its panels with businesses. They mean the Bank can see the current impact of Brexit, and how a disorderly exit will hit supply and demand. [I think this is a reference to Economists For Free Trade, who have some very optimistic forecasts for the post-Brexit world] Q: You say a no-deal Brexit isn\u2019t likely, but is it more likely than at our previous press conference three months ago? Tough to say, says Carney. But the looming deadline is concentrating minds, and causing companies to defer investment plans. Q: You say a no-deal Brexit would deliver \u201can immediate and material hit\u201d to the economy -- what will that mean in practice? At a minimum, there will be logistical challenges getting goods through ports, and a knock-on impact on some firms\u2019 ability to run at full capacity, says Carney, Q: What will that mean for ordinary people? It depends on the ability of individual firms to prepare for it, the governor replies cagily, particularly those which currently have seamless access to the EU. Q: The government has said this week that austerity is over, but won\u2019t austerity be back if there is a disorderly exit from the EU? Fiscal decisions are a matter for politicians; we set monetary policy around them, Carney says - declining to stray from \u2018his lane\u2019. Regarding the budget.... there has been a shift in the sand towards a more accommodative fiscal stance (because Philip Hammond boosted spending and cut taxes on Monday), but the Bank is still digesting the consequences. On possible future interest rate rises, Mark Carney says he does expect a \u201crebound\u201d in the economy if a Brexit deal is agreed. We are currently at the point of \u201cmaximum uncertainty\u201d over Brexit now, so it\u2019s understandable that businesses are being very cautious, and holding their spending back. Q: Are you saying that you can\u2019t rule out raising interest rates, even if a no-deal Brexit pushes the UK into recession? Carney says a no-deal, no transition Brexit is unlikely, but the Bank has to be ready. Second, it all depends what happens to supply, demand, and the exchange rate, he reiterates. Thirdly, there would be a \u201cpotentially fairly large\u201d hit to supply, more rapid than one is accustomed to in an advanced economy. So the MPC would have to balance the impact on the exchange rate, and any tariffs, against its desire to provide what support it can to the economy. There are scenarios where policy would need to be tightened in the event of a no-deal, no-transition, disorderly Brexit, but that isn\u2019t what we expect to happen, Carney concludes. In other words, the Bank could be forced to raise interest rates if the pound slumped, pushing up import costs, and tariffs were slapped on imported goods too. Carney is explaining that the Bank must decide how to balance inflationary pressures against any future supply shock. Whatever happens after Brexit, we will set monetary policy to ensure price stability and support the economy during the transition, Mark Carney pledges. Three factors will be crucial when deciding future interest rate moves, he explains: Demand: Withdrawal from the EU will effect demand for UK goods. The impact will be more negative if Brexit is disruptive Supply: There will be a drag on supply as the process of adjusting to Brexit unfolds. If this process is gradual, the impact will be limited. But \u201can abrupt and disorderly withdrawal\u201d could lead to severe disruption at the UK border The value of the pound: It could rise if the financial markets have an optimistic view of Britain\u2019s future prospects, but a \u201cdisruptive\u201d Brexit could push the pound down. A weaker pound would push up inflation. Carney adds that there is little that monetary policy can do to help with large, negative supply shocks. On Brexit, governor Carney says that UK companies are now \u201cunderstandably postponing investment\u201d until they have more clarity about the future. UK households are more \u201csanguine\u201d, though. Bank of England governor Mark Carney begins his press conference, by explaining that Britain\u2019s economy is facing a \u201cseries of transitions\u201d. They are: Global financial conditions are tightening, and trade growth is slowing UK fiscal policy is moving to a more accommodative stance The UK economy is adjusting to a new, and currently uncertain, relationship with the European Union Here\u2019s our news story on the Bank of England decision: The Bank of England press conference is underway. You can watch it here. There aren\u2019t any big shocks in the Bank\u2019s new forecasts, but it has trimmed its growth and inflation outlook for 2019: You can see the latest quarterly inflation report online, here. The Bank are helpfully tweeting some charts from today\u2019s quarterly inflation report. Importantly, the Bank of England is signalling that interest rates could fall OR rise after Brexit, depending on how events turn out. It says: The economic outlook will depend significantly on the nature of EU withdrawal, in particular the form of new trading arrangements, the smoothness of the transition to them and the responses of households, businesses and financial markets. The implications for the appropriate path of monetary policy will depend on the balance of the effects on demand, supply and the exchange rate. The MPC judges that the monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction. The Bank has published a handy explanation for today\u2019s decision, and flagged up that interest rates will probably rise \u201ca bit more\u201d over the next few years. Over the past few years, our economy has needed interest rates to stay very low as we recovered from the global financial crisis. But things have been changing. Our economy now needs a little less support because it is growing a little faster than it has capacity to and inflation is above our 2% target. To ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the target, we need to keep the economy growing at around its speed limit. That is why we raised the official interest rate from 0.5% to 0.75% in August. After raising interest rates in August, this month we have left them unchanged. If the economy performs as we expect, we think we will need to raise interest rates a bit more over the next few years. We expect any rises in interest rates to happen at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. Interest rates are likely to remain substantially lower than a decade ago. And here\u2019s a topline view of the economy: The Bank of England is hopeful that UK business investment will pick up -- if Britain secures a smooth transition deal as it exits the European Union. The Bank says: Business investment has been more subdued than previously anticipated, as the effect of Brexit uncertainty has intensified. Under the smooth transition assumption on which the forecast is conditioned, greater clarity is expected to emerge over the coming months, boosting investment growth. The Bank is also concerned that trade disputes could escalate, hurting the global economy. It says: The global economy continues to grow at above potential rates, supporting UK net trade. Growth has softened, however, and become more uneven across countries, and downside risks have risen. Global financial conditions have tightened, particularly in emerging market economies, and activity has slowed in the euro area. Trade restrictions have increased and there is a risk of further escalation. The Bank of England has also warned that uncertainty over Brexit is weighing on the economy. The minutes of today\u2019s meeting say: \u201cThe recent intensification of Brexit uncertainty appeared likely to keep business spending subdued in the near term. Breaking: The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged, at 0.75%. More to follow! October was a brutal month for the markets, despite yesterday\u2019s Halloween rally. November has got off to a better start, though, with Europe\u2019s main indices all up: It\u2019s nearly time for the Bank of England to announce its decision on interest rates, and release its latest quarterly inflation report. That report will show the Bank\u2019s new growth and inflation forecast, so should guide us as to the next rate rise (assuming it doesn\u2019t come today!). Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool suggests rates shouldn\u2019t rise next year. He writes: I have plotted annual GDP growth in the UK (%) together with the Bank\u2019s 1-quarter ahead and 1-year ahead forecasts (most likely outcomes based on market expectations of interest rates). Since 2006, the Bank has over-predicted next quarter\u2019s growth by an average of 0.35% per annum and next year\u2019s growth by an average of 0.94% (!) per annum. Since the EU referendum vote, the Bank has improved its forecasting record but still over-predicts next quarter\u2019s growth by an average of 0.15% per annum and next year\u2019s GDP by an average of 0.31% per annum. So history is telling us that we will the Bank\u2019s GDP growth rate forecast for 2019 needs to be trimmed by a sizeable 0.31% to infer the \u201ccorrect\u201d GDP growth rate. This is a good reason to put any planned interest rate hikes for 2019 on hold\u2026 The slowdown in UK manufacturing is another example of how a cheap currency isn\u2019t enough, on its own, to spur exports. But Sacha Chorley, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, argues that sterling\u2019s weakness since the 2016 EU referendum vote may be cushioning some blows. He says: \u201cManufacturing has been crushed by concerns over Brexit, with so many uncertainties surrounding imports and exports leading to a steady decline in manufacturing growth, which is headed back toward the levels seen immediately after the referendum. \u201cIt is particularly notable that this is happening amid a climate of a depreciated pound. Normally this would be expected to stimulate export orders, so it is possible the figures may have been weaker without the exchange rate on the pound falling. The sub-50 employment score is also notably weak, indicating firms are trying to keep a lid on hiring. This will be linked to new order expectations and cost cutting. Newsflash: The Appledore shipyard in Devon is to close, in another blow to British manufacturing. Babcock, the engineering and defence firm, has decided to shut Appledore after new orders dried up, ending a 163-year history. In a statement, it says: Babcock International has today announced it has taken the difficult decision to exit operations at its Appledore facility in Devon, ending its site lease in March 2019. Babcock\u2019s focus is now firmly on its workforce and its determination to protect their employment within the business. To that end, the company will offer relocation opportunities for all 199 Appledore employees at other Babcock facilities, 140 of whom are already on short-term redeployment to its Devonport operations. Babcock very much regrets having to take this course of action and recognises the impact it will have on its dedicated and professional workforce. The company will now engage in a consultation period, working closely with its employees and their Trade Unions representatives during this difficult time. The Appledore Yard was founded in 1855, and is situated on the estuary of the River Torridge in North Devon. It has produced, or helped produce, survey vessels for the Royal Navy, patrol vessels for the Irish Naval Service, ferries, dredgers and commercial vessels, plus two tall ships for the Tall Ships Youth Trust. Unions had fought to preserve the shipyard. Yesterday they handed the Minister of Defence a petition with 10,000 signatures, urging it to save Appledore. Reaction to the slowdown at British factories last month is flooding in. Justin Benson, head of automotive at KPMG UK, says manufacturing is misfiring. \u201cWith the UK manufacturing PMI for October dropping by 2.5 points, it suggests that business confidence is on a downward trend. Combine that with Brexit, trade negotiations between the US and China, German elections and Italian debt, the picture it paints is one of increased geopolitical uncertainty. Shannon Murphy, assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes, says UK factories will remain under the cosh until they have some certainty on Brexit: \u201cOur clients are reporting that their customers are cutting contracts for new orders from six months to three. The focus is narrowing from long-term plans as businesses try to manage uncertainty. Until firms have more clarity about what a future relationship with the EU looks like, investment levels are likely to continue to flatline and confidence will remain low. It\u2019s a good time to review credit management procedures.\u201d Economist Samuel Tombs of Pantheon fears the UK economy is weakening: Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, is more confident - pointing out that today\u2019s manufacturing PMI report does show (modest) growth last month. \u201cThe drop in the PMI reading is disappointing but let\u2019s not lose sight of the fact it has remained above 50 \u2013 the indicator of growth \u2013 for 27 consecutive months. \u201cOur recent sector survey suggested that once we have clarity about the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU we\u2019ll likely see further growth, with many manufacturers expecting this to deliver a shot of confidence to the sector. But the changes in Europe aren\u2019t the only headwind facing exporters, with some automotive firms citing slow growth in emerging markets like China as a driver behind recent operational changes. \u201cMore positively firms across automotive, aerospace and rail sectors are continuing to honour long-term investment plans, despite uncertainty. Economics professor Prem Sikka says the government must do more: City economists had expected UK factory growth to dip a little last month, but today\u2019s report is much gloomier than feared. As well as trade wars and Brexit, car manufacturers have been struggling to meet new tougher emissions tests, leading to lower production and a testing backlog. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says the slump in the UK manufacturing PMI (to just 51.1, from 53.6) is a real worry. He says Brexit has hurt confidence, and is deterring some firms from hiring new staff. Brock explains: \u201cAlarm bells were ringing in the sector this month as the Index slipped closer to edge of the no-change mark with purchasing falling for the first time in over two years. Overall activity was marred by a drop in export orders and continuing weak domestic demand as Brexit took another bite out of client confidence. \u201cTo see inflows of new orders first decline since the middle of 2016 following the referendum, will send shivers down the spine of business. Any hope that the current situation would not continue to impact has surely now evaporated. Employment was also affected with lower levels of hiring, as companies tried to control their costs. Job seekers will find the hiring landscape less friendly during the run-up to departure. Capital Economics also fear that UK factories are heading towards stagnation: Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, says Britain\u2019s manufacturers suffered \u201ca worrying turnaround\u201d for the worst last month. He fears that the sector could actually shrink over the next few months. At current levels, the survey indicates that factory output could contract in the fourth quarter, dropping by 0.2%. New orders and employment both fell for the first time since the Brexit vote as domestic and overseas demand were hit by a combination of Brexit uncertainties, rising global trade tensions and especially weak demand for autos. Markit found that some firms have been protecting cash flow and cost-cutting, rather than restocking their inventories. Business confidence weakened in October too, Dobson adds, amid \u201crising Brexit-related uncertainties and escalating global trade tensions.\u201d UK factories were hit by a drop in foreign demand in October, for the second time in the past three months. Markit says: Some companies reported that Brexit uncertainties had negatively impacted inflows of new work from within the EU. Others focussed more attention on rising global trade tensions and weaker demand from the world autos sector. NEWSFLASH: UK manufacturing growth slumped last month, as factories were hit by a drop in orders. Data firm Markit reports that conditions in the UK manufacturing sector slowed sharply during October. It blames the trade wars trigged by Donald Trump, and the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. In a new healthcheck, Markit says: Output growth weakened, while new order inflows and employment both declined for the first time since July 2016 (the PMI survey directly following the EU referendum). The drop in new business was partly driven by rising global trade tensions and Brexit uncertainties. This dragged the UK manufacturing PMI (a broad measure of activity) down to just 51.1 in October, a 27-month low, from 53.6. Any reading over 50 shows growth. New orders and employment levels both declined for first time in 27 months, it adds. More to follow! Today\u2019s housing data might dampen the mood at the Bank of England -- house prices growth has slipped to a five-year low. Prices were flat month-on-month in October, which dragged annual house price inflation down to just 1.6%. A former Bank of England policymaker, Andrew Sentance, argues that the BoE should stop prevaricating, and raise interest rates today (spoiler alert: it won\u2019t (probably)...) He writes: On the productivity front, low interest rates may be contributing to the problem rather than providing the solution. Only when interest rates return to more normal levels will businesses have the right incentives to raise productivity and efficiency. A further quarter-point rise in interest rates on Thursday is therefore unlikely to dent growth prospects in the UK economy. Indeed, in the US \u2014 where interest rates have been raised from around zero to around 2% since 2015 \u2014 economic growth has been very strong and resilient. The MPC and the Treasury need to adjust to low economic growth in the UK. It appears to be the \u201cNew Normal\u201d, and the sooner we recognise that the better. Sterling is jumping sharply today, following reports the UK and the EU are close to an agreement on a crucial part of Brexit. The Times newspaper has got the City excited, by reporting that Theresa May has struck a deal with Brussels that would give UK financial services companies continued access to European markets after Brexit. A government source told the newspaper that British and European negotiators have reached a \u201ctentative agreement on all aspects of a future partnership on services, as well as the exchange of data\u201d. The breakthrough is apparently based on the idea of regulatory equivalence -- in broad terms, the EU and UK agreeing that both sides\u2019 rules are equally strict. That would allow City firms to keep operating in Europe, even after they lose their current \u2018passporting\u2019 rights. But there are disadvantages -- equivalence isn\u2019t as concrete as passporting, and one side could be forced by the other side to implement new rules to avoid breaching equivalence (the FT has a good explanation here). Still, the news has cheered currency traders -- sending the pound soaring by nearly one and a half cents to $1.29. Mohammed Kazmi, portfolio manager at private bank UBP, believes the Bank of England could hint at a 2019 interest rate hike today: The Monetary Policy Committee meeting is once again coming at a time of great uncertainty for the BoE with the Brexit deal still hanging in the balance. A lack of clarity herein, coupled with rising external risks following the tightening of financial conditions globally, should keep the bank firmly in a wait-and-see mode. Recent wage growth strength should provide Carney with enough confidence to continue to commit to a rate hike next year, especially with this hike not fully priced until end-2019 now. The pound has been an underperformer recently amongst the majors given the political backdrop and rating agency comments; however, the BoE is unlikely to change this course, with concrete progress on a transition deal required for a turn instead, especially given the stronger dollar backdrop. Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Robert Wood concurs that rate will stay on hold today, telling clients (via Reuters): \u201cUntil a deal is done - or not - we suspect the BoE is in suspended animation,\u201d Brexit uncertainty makes if effectively impossible for the Bank of England to raise borrowing costs at noon today, economists reckon. As CNBC puts it: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Brexit uncertainty the Bank of England would probably be thinking about putting interest rates up this week,\u201d Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told CNBC via email, adding that interest rates look \u201cunnecessarily low. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Bank of England is centre-stage today, as it meets to set UK interest rates and update us on its view of the UK economy. It\u2019s a year since the BoE raised borrowing costs for the first time in a decade (from 0.25% to 0.5%), which was followed by a second small increase in August (to 0.75%). The City doesn\u2019t expect a hike today, but we could get some firm hints about when borrowing costs return to the giddy heights of 1% or more. The Bank\u2019s quarterly inflation report will also show if the Monetary Policy is more optimistic about UK growth prospects. With wage growth running at a nine-year high of 3.1%, and growth holding up despite Brexit uncertainty, the Bank\u2019s policymakers may be getting twitchy. Does Britain really need such low borrowing costs, and weak savings rates, a decade after the financial crisis? Last month, chief economist Andy Haldane claimed that things are looking up: \u201cI think there is more compelling evidence of a new dawn breaking for pay growth, albeit with the light filtering through only slowly,\u201d Of course, the Bank can\u2019t really consider raising interest rate until Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is resolved. Yesterday, Brexit secretary Dominic Raab suggested a deal would be done within three weeks, only to execute a dizzying and ungainly u-turn a few hours later... But still, Carney\u2019s comments could lift or sink sterling. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, says: Traders\u2019 attention will turn to the Bank of England monetary policy decision today which is expected to keep interest rates on hold. While Mark Carney\u2019s speech and the Quarterly Inflation Report may move the Pound slightly, it\u2019s still all about the Brexit deal that will decide the fate of the currency. We\u2019ll discover if the Brexit fog is chilling the economy this morning, when data firm Markit publishes its latest survey of factory firms. The manufacturing PMI is expected to fall to 53 from 53.8, which would show slowing growth.

The then-chancellor and the Bank warned before the referendum that interest rates might rise if the UK voted leave. Most economists and commentators, myself included, said that this seemed deeply implausible.</p> <p>Lo and behold, at the first practicable moment after the referendum the Bank cut interest rates. It even pumped an extra few tens of billions of pounds into the economy through quantitative easing.</p> <p>In short, it did precisely the opposite of what it warned about before the referendum.

      "bodyText": "The chair of the Commons housing select committee has urged the government to give details of how it will crack down on rogue landlords, in the wake of an investigation by the Guardian and ITV. Clive Betts, the Labour MP who leads the housing, communities and local government committee, wrote that the investigation \u201chighlighted significant issues around the effectiveness of current government policies\u201d for the private rental sector, in a letter sent to housing minister James Brokenshire on Wednesday. MPs are \u201cincreasingly concerned that government efforts to protect the most vulnerable tenants in the sector are not working\u201d, Betts wrote. The Guardian/ITV investigation revealed that convicted landlords who have been ruled unfit to rent out properties are continuing to collect rent, often paid from housing benefit. Legislation currently allows landlords who have failed a \u201cfit and proper\u201d person test in one borough to continue to rent out properties in other council areas. The investigation also revealed that no entries had been made at the end of August in a database designed to track rogue landlords and property agents. The database is not currently available to the public, despite being hailed as a important tool to allow local councils to clamp down on landlords. Prime Minister Theresa May last week promised to give tenants access to the database, in a U-turn. The government had planned to prevent public access to the information. Betts, the Labour MP for Sheffield South East, said MPs were \u201cconcerned\u201d by the reports. He asked the government to clarify the number of entries in the database since it was launched in April this year, as well as when the database will be made publicly available. The government had previously estimated that there were as many as 10,500 rogue landlords in England alone. The Guardian/ITV investigation found evidence of millionaire landlords cutting off electricity at their rental properties, stolen deposits and illegal forced evictions that left tenants homeless. The plight of tenants in private rented accommodation has risen up the political agenda in recent months. The government is currently supporting a private member\u2019s bill, sponsored by Labour MP Karen Buck, which will give tenants new powers to take their landlords to court if homes are not fit for human habitation during their tenancy. The bill, which passed its third reading last week, has also been backed by groups representing landlords, tenants, and local authorities. Betts wrote: \u201cWe believe it is important for the government to take steps to ensure that the new rights granted by this bill are not illusory, and that tenants \u2013 especially those who are most vulnerable \u2013 are able to enforce them in practice \u2026 Tenants in the private rented sector need far greater protections from retaliatory eviction, rent increases and harassment from their landlords.\u201d A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cThis government is committed to tackling the minority of rogue landlords who exploit tenants. Through fines, banning orders and the new rogue landlord database, we have provided councils with new enforcement tools and we expect them to use these powers to crack down on bad landlords. \u201cEveryone deserves a safe place to call home, and we will continue to work with the sector to ensure this is the case.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The chair of the Commons housing select committee has urged the government to give details of how it will crack down on rogue landlords, in the wake of an investigation by the Guardian and ITV.</p> <p>Clive Betts, the Labour MP who leads the housing, communities and local government committee, wrote that the investigation \u201chighlighted significant issues around the effectiveness of current government policies\u201d for the private rental sector, in a letter sent to housing minister James Brokenshire on Wednesday.</p> <p>MPs are \u201cincreasingly concerned that government efforts to protect the most vulnerable tenants in the sector are not working\u201d, Betts wrote.</p> <p>The Guardian/ITV investigation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/23/rogue-landlords-rental-law-guardian-itv-news\">revealed that convicted landlords who have been ruled unfit to rent out properties are continuing to collect rent</a>, often paid from housing benefit. Legislation currently allows landlords who have failed a \u201cfit and proper\u201d person test in one borough to continue to rent out properties in other council areas.</p> <p>The investigation also revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/23/governments-rogue-landlord-list-empty-after-six-months\">no entries had been made at the end of August in a database designed to track rogue landlords</a> and property agents. The database is not currently available to the public, despite being hailed as a important tool to allow local councils to clamp down on landlords.</p> <p>Prime Minister Theresa May last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/24/government-policing-of-rogue-landlords-labelled-pathetic\">promised to give tenants access to the database</a>, in a U-turn. The government had planned to prevent public access to the information.</p> <p>Betts, the Labour MP for Sheffield South East, said MPs were \u201cconcerned\u201d by the reports. He asked the government to clarify the number of entries in the database since it was launched in April this year, as well as when the database will be made publicly available.</p> <p>The government had previously estimated that there were as many as 10,500 rogue landlords in England alone.</p> <p>The Guardian/ITV investigation found evidence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/23/mould-evictions-vermin-stories-of-a-30m-property-empire\">millionaire landlords cutting off electricity at their rental properties</a>, stolen deposits and illegal forced evictions that left tenants homeless.</p> <p>The plight of tenants in private rented accommodation has risen up the political agenda in recent months. The government is currently supporting a private member\u2019s bill, sponsored by Labour MP Karen Buck, which will give tenants new powers to take their landlords to court if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2018/jan/18/fought-hard-homes-fit-for-habitation-bill-heres-why\">homes are not fit for human habitation</a> during their tenancy.</p> <p>The bill, which passed its third reading last week, has also been backed by groups representing landlords, tenants, and local authorities.</p> <p>Betts wrote: \u201cWe believe it is important for the government to take steps to ensure that the new rights granted by this bill are not illusory, and that tenants \u2013 especially those who are most vulnerable \u2013 are able to enforce them in practice \u2026 Tenants in the private rented sector need far greater protections from retaliatory eviction, rent increases and harassment from their landlords.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cThis government is committed to tackling the minority of rogue landlords who exploit tenants. Through fines, banning orders and the new rogue landlord database, we have provided councils with new enforcement tools and we expect them to use these powers to crack down on bad landlords.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone deserves a safe place to call home, and we will continue to work with the sector to ensure this is the case.\u201d</p>",

The UK\u2019s old ambition for a \u201cmutual recognition\u201d pact was ditched in the summer because the EU wouldn\u2019t tolerate anything that looked like cherry-picking. Thus Thursday\u2019s excitement, which provoked a sharp rise in the pound, was about likely agreement on a regime based on regulatory \u201cequivalence\u201d, a looser arrangement that would at least maintain access to EU markets for UK banks, insurers and asset managers. Even on that score, however, it would be wise not to order champagne yet. First, both UK and EU officials were sniffy about a deal actually being done. Second, everything depends on a wider withdrawal agreement being signed. Third, equivalence alone wouldn\u2019t represent a triumph, since this is one area of the Brexit negotiations where London holds a few decent cards \u2013 the UK, as the governor of the Bank of England has put it, is \u201cthe banker for Europe\u201d. The real ambition, then, is to secure a version of \u201cenhanced equivalence\u201d that acknowledges that status. Equivalence, under EU rules, is just recognition that another country\u2019s financial rules are equally as robust. On day one, that would obviously be the case with the UK. The important part \u2013 the \u201cenhanced\u201d part \u2013 is about future arrangements. A deal in which the EU can unilaterally remove equivalent status from the UK at 30 days\u2019 notice, as it can for other outside countries, would be almost useless. A period of 18 months, at least, is needed for stability, say many finance executives. But it is even more important that any new setup minimises the chances of such standoffs happening but also allows the UK to be more than a humble rule-taker. The aim is a deal in which UK financial officialdom gets a formal voice and rights of arbitration. If all that happens, there would be something to applaud. But it would be astonishing if the bargaining has reached the nitty-gritty stage. It seems more likely that any initial agreement on financial services will merely cover broad principles, with details left to be thrashed out next year. Yet the degree to which the City becomes a rule-taker is the crucial bit. In the circumstances, sterling\u2019s 1% jump was odd. No need for Patisserie saviour to glaze over everything Patisserie Holdings shareholders have overcome their shock and would now like some answers as to how a \u00a340m black hole could appear in the accounts. Luke Johnson is testing their patience. The executive chairman and 37% shareholder did a fine thing when he lent \u00a320m of his own money to save the business from collapse, but his refusal to offer even a sketchy account of how Patisserie landed itself in such a sticky mess is becoming tiresome. Johnson\u2019s line \u2013 repeated often at Thursday\u2019s shareholder meeting to approve \u00a315.7m in fundraising from other shareholders \u2013 is that nothing can be said for the time being in case it would prejudice investigations by the Serious Fraud Office and others. But the fact of an SFO inquiry is not a reason for a board to take a complete vow of silence. It\u2019s just a prompt to be careful about what is said. Johnson could answer several questions safely. For example: since installing a reporting function \u201cappropriate for a quoted company\u201d is one of two conditions Patisserie says must be satisfied before trading in the shares can resume, what progress has been made? And how was it possible to have inappropriate financial controls for so long? Johnson could also explain why the board\u2019s own investigation into the affair hasn\u2019t been handed to an outside law or accountancy firm. The SFO is obviously the right body to investigate allegations of fraud, but Patisserie\u2019s owners also want an unvarnished view of potential incompetence in the boardroom. That would be best delivered by a fully independent outfit. Having PwC assist a board-led inquiry is not the same. Johnson should rethink. He\u2019s rightly been applauded for his rescue act, but his obligations to co-investors don\u2019t end there.",

    "webTitle": "Bank may not cut interest rates in support of no-deal Brexit, says Carney", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned that there is no guarantee it would cut interest rates to support growth and jobs under a disorderly Brexit and said it might have to raise borrowing costs instead. In its quarterly health check on the economy, Threadneedle Street\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said he still expected London and Brussels to come to an agreement. However, he added that it should not be assumed that the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee would respond to a chaotic Brexit by repeating the cut in interest rates it delivered after the EU referendum in 2016. Carney said that the MPC would assess the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the demand for goods and services, the supply-side potential of the economy and the value of the pound before deciding on its response. Only if the shock to demand were greater than that to supply would it cut rates. \u201cSince the nature of EU withdrawal is not known at present, and its impact on the balance of demand, supply and the exchange rate cannot be determined in advance, the monetary policy response will not be automatic and could be in either direction,\u201d the governor said. A threat to increase interest rates by the MPC will add pressure on the European Research Group of Tory MPs, who currently prefer adopting World Trade Organization trade tariffs to accepting Theresa May\u2019s Chequers deal. James Smith, economist at banking group ING, said it was far more likely that rates would be cut if negotiations ended in failure. \u201cIn a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario, the Bank has suggested rates could go in either direction. However, given the wide-scale disruption that would likely occur, we suspect policymakers would \u2018look through\u2019 any spike in prices caused by a weaker pound, and cut interest rates or increase quantitative easing fairly swiftly.\u201d Carney said the Bank was working on the basis that there would be an agreement, because both the UK and the EU wanted one. Announcing the latest decision of its rate-setting committee on Thursday, the Bank said the MPC voted unanimously to keep the base rate at 0.75%. On the assumption that there is a smooth Brexit, the MPC thinks it will need to raise rates gradually from their current level of 0.75% in order to keep inflation close to its 2% target. Threadneedle Street believes businesses will unlock investment that has been put on hold while there has been uncertainty about the future UK-EU relationship, pushing growth up from 1.5% in 2018 to 1.7% in each of the next two years. Apart from Brexit, the MPC expressed concern that the slowdown in the global economy and the impact of the US-China trade dispute would have an impact on the UK. The inflation report cited weaker GDP growth across the eurozone and in China over recent months. Several large developing world countries have also seen their growth rates tumble, leaving the US as one of the main pillars keeping global rates from falling below their recent average. \u201cA broad-based increase in barriers to trade between countries could have a material impact on global activity and, in turn, on the UK economy,\u201d it said. In the UK, the job market has strengthened since the Bank\u2019s last quarterly report in August and wages have risen more strongly than expected. Wage increases are expected to push up prices in the shops over the Bank\u2019s forecast period of the next two to three years. However, offsetting this trend is a more subdued increase in import costs compared with last year, when a slump in sterling pushed up imports prices at a faster rate. The Bank said its quarterly inflation report, which it published alongside the interest rate decision, was finalised before Philip Hammond\u2019s budget on Monday and had therefore excluded the chancellor\u2019s spending plans. But it is understood that the Bank would consider Hammond\u2019s budget to be a mild economic stimulant that could mean interest rates rise faster than expected. At the moment, the MPC is expected to increase the base rate once in each of the next three years, though the financial markets, which are increasingly fearful of a no-deal Brexit, only anticipate two rate rises over that period. Central bank officials have for some time expected the government to secure an agreement with Brussels that will pave the way for a trade deal, leaving the import and export of goods and services little changed. This remains the government\u2019s policy and the Bank believes it has little choice but to base its forecasts on this scenario.",

However, given the wide-scale disruption that would likely occur, we suspect policymakers would \u2018look through\u2019 any spike in prices caused by a weaker pound, and cut interest rates or increase quantitative easing fairly swiftly.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5cabd7be-b5eb-47dd-abff-1cb3bed9e36e\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Lenders have already bumped up the cost of fixed rate mortgages ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s decision to raise base rate from 0.25% to 0.5%, and mortgage borrowers on tracker and variable rates will see their monthly payments become more expensive in the coming days.&nbsp;\u200b</p>\n    <p>Savers will gain as banks and building societies improve the rates available on deposit and Isa accounts, although increases are unlikely to come for several weeks.</p>\n    <p>How much consumers and businesses cut back on spending and investment in the face of higher rates will depend on signals from the Bank about the trend for future increases.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Carney said the Bank was working on the basis that there would be an agreement, because both the UK and the EU wanted one.</p> \n<p>Announcing the latest decision of its rate-setting committee on Thursday, the Bank said the MPC <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-summary-and-minutes/2018/november-2018\">voted unanimously to keep the base rate at 0.75%</a>.

      "bodyText": "Defence firm Babcock International is to close a historic shipyard in Devon, despite a last-ditch \u00a360m offer of work from the government. The closure of Appledore shipyard, located at the mouth of the river Torridge, near Barnstaple on the north Devon coast, will put almost 200 jobs at risk. The company will end its lease on the site in March 2019 after 11 years, having failed to find enough work to sustain the yard, which generated revenues of \u00a324m in the last financial year. The yard had recently completed a four-ship order for patrol vessels for the Irish navy. Babcock, which has a stock market value of \u00a33bn and is listed on the FTSE 250, rejected offers from the government of work which would have taken place at its separate Devonport shipyard, where 140 Appledore staff are on \u201cshort-term redeployment\u201d by the firm. Babcock made revenues of \u00a35.4bn in the last financial year. The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, wrote that Babcock indicated that the \u00a360m contract was not \u201cenough to secure the long-term future of the yard\u201d, in a leaked letter sent on Wednesday to Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general and local Conservative MP. The closure came after a week of talks between defence officials and Babcock. Williamson said it remained a \u201ccommercial decision\u201d for Babcock. The 199 employees at the yard will all be offered the opportunity to relocate to Devonport, located almost two hours away by car near Plymouth. The closure is the latest economic blow for the north Devon community, which has suffered from the gradual winding down of the shipyard as well as the decline of its centuries-old fishing industry. Unions and staff were informed of Babcock\u2019s decision on Thursday. The firm has begun a consultation period with the workers. Jake McLean, the representative of the GMB union at Appledore, said the decision was \u201ca devastating blow to the workforce and the local community\u201d. \u201cWe want answers from the government and Babcock about the package that was offered to save the yard,\u201d he said. The shipyard traces its history back to 1855 and played a part in the shipbuilding effort during the second world war. Appledore recently played a key role in the new Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers, the HMS Queen Elizabeth and the HMS Prince of Wales. Appledore delivered more than 10,000 tonnes of manufactured components for the ships to Rosyth, in Scotland, for final assembly. Babcock\u2019s statement said it was a \u201cdifficult decision\u201d to close the yard, and said its \u201cfocus is now firmly on its workforce and its determination to protect their employment within the business\u201d.",

Patisserie Holdings, which has more than 200 cafes and nearly 3,000 staff, has been forced to raise new cash after saying that \u201cfraudulent activity\u201d had been uncovered that left the business close to collapse. The group\u2019s multimillionaire chairman, Luke Johnson, put up \u00a320m of his own money to keep the group in business after an initial internal investigation found that it was nearly \u00a310m in debt instead of having \u00a328m in the bank, as it had last reported. On Thursday morning, the company sought shareholder approval for two share placings that will raise \u00a315.7m, \u00a310m of which will be used to pay back half of Johnson\u2019s emergency loans. Shareholders holding 99% of Patisserie Holdings\u2019 stock who voted on Thursday approved the placing. Johnson said that a share placing, which involves the sale of 31.54m shares to institutional investors at 50p each, a hefty discount to the 429.5p price of Patisserie Holding\u2019s stock when its shares were suspended last month, was \u201cthe only course of action open to the company\u201d. He said no other options had been put forward to shareholders because the company was \u201cwithin hours of going into bankruptcy\u201d when it agreed the placing with institutions. Johnson thanked shareholders who had sent messages of support and said he wanted to reassure them that \u201cmanagement is doing everything we can to address the situation, get to the bottom of what happened and safeguard the company and its future.\u201d But he said: \u201cIt won\u2019t be quick or easy but we are determined to succeed.\u201d Johnson said trading at the cake shop group was currently \u201cfine\u201d and one of two stores closed in the wake of the accounting scandal had reopened on Thursday. He said he could not give further details about the company\u2019s investigation into its accounting black hole as that risked prejudicing enquiries under way by authorities including the Serious Fraud Office. The company has called in forensic accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers to trawl through its accounts and Johnson said all the details of its findings would be laid out \u201conce we are confident we have got to the bottom of it\u201d. But a number of shareholders at the meeting backed Angus Forbes, an independent shareholder, who said Patisserie Holdings should be \u201cdiscussing all the options\u201d and not rushing ahead with the heavily discounted placing which discriminated against small scale investors. He said that if the company\u2019s fundraising plan went ahead he would \u201cwant the company to go to hell\u201d but if it offered all shareholders an equal chance to put money in then it would be \u201can act of solidarity\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "New home registrations in Britain have reached their highest level in more than a decade, boosted by a number of large developments in London, according to an industry body. But the National House Building Council (NHBC), which released the figures, also warned of caution in the industry until the economic impact of Brexit becomes clearer. The NHBC said 43,578 new homes were registered between July and September, up 15% from the same period a year earlier. It is the highest total since the third quarter of 2007, when 49,520 new homes were registered just before the start of the global financial crisis. The figures are taken from builders responsible for around 80% of homes constructed in the UK. Builders are required to register houses with the NHBC, the main warranty and insurance provider in the UK, before starting work. The private sector accounted for 33,520 new homes, up 16%, with another 10,058 homes in the affordable sector, up 12%. New home registrations in London increased 141% to 6,007 from 2,492 a year earlier, an unusually low number following the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017. Housing associations are involved in a number of big London developments, including Swan Housing Association\u2019s \u00a3300m project in Poplar with 1,500 planned homes, half of which are slated as affordable. Developer Countryside Properties and London &amp; Quadrant (L&amp;Q) Housing Trust have teamed up to redevelop the former Ford factory site in Dagenham with up to 3,000 homes, half of them affordable. Housing associations also play a big part in the north-west of England, where L&amp;Q has gone into partnership with Trafford Housing Trust in Manchester. There was a further boost from build-to-rent projects, including Delancey\u2019s Elephant &amp; Castle revamp with 374 rental flats. Seven of the UK\u2019s 12 regions recorded growth, led by London, Yorkshire and the Humber up 39%, the south-west up 34% and Scotland up 20%. Housebuilding has recovered since the lows during the financial crisis to more than 217,000 homes in England in the 2016-17 financial year, according to official figures. The government\u2019s target is 300,000 new homes a year by 2022, but the majority of housebuilders think it will be missed by at least 50,000, a Knight Frank survey has shown. Steve Wood, NHBC\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe upturn in registrations over recent months is good news for the industry and shows that there remains a strong demand for high quality new homes in many parts of the UK.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe industry remains cautious in the short-run until the economic impact of Brexit is clearer.\u201d The property firm Jones Lang LaSalle predicted a swift recovery in house prices from the second half of next year. Despite the deadlocked negotiations between London and Brussels, JLL believes there is a 90% chance of a Brexit deal being reached, and that prices will rise quickly thereafter, starting in London and southern England, where some areas have recorded sharp declines in recent months. The firm predicts 11.4% growth in house prices across the UK over the next five years. In prime central London areas, prices are forecast to grow 15% between 2019 and 2023.",

    "webTitle": "Third of Britons have stopped or reduced eating meat - report", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One in eight Britons are now vegetarian or vegan, according to a report on food shopping that underlines a revolution in the UK\u2019s eating habits. A further 21% claim to be flexitarian, where a largely vegetable-based diet is supplemented occasionally with meat, which means a third of UK consumers have deliberately reduced the amount of meat they eat or removed it from their diet entirely. The findings in the annual food and drink report from the supermarket chain Waitrose come as food choices assume an increasingly important role in the debate over countering climate change. A series of influential reports have said that avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way consumers can reduce their environmental impact on the planet, because farming animals is such a CO2-intensive process. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely encouraging to learn how many Britons are choosing to reduce their consumption of animal products\u201d said Nick Palmer, the head of Compassion in World Farming UK. \u201cScience proves that the healthiest diet is one that is plant-heavy. By eating less meat, fish, eggs and dairy and choosing higher welfare when we do, we can all help animals, people and the planet.\u201d The Waitrose report is based on research among shoppers across all British supermarket chains. The retailer\u2019s executive chef, Jonathan Moore, said: \u201cVegetarianism has grown and evolved. More people dip in and out of it. There was a time when choosing a plant-based diet was about taking an ethical stand based on unwavering principles. For many, this distinction between vegetarians and meat-eaters still exists but for others the lines have blurred.\u201d Publication of the findings represents awkward timing for Waitrose. It comes a day after the editor of its food magazine, William Sitwell, said he was stepping down after an email exchange with a freelance journalist emerged in which he mocked vegans and suggested they should be force-fed meat. The number of vegans in the UK, who shun all animal products including dairy and eggs, has grown fourfold in the past four years from 150,000 to 600,000, according to the Vegan Society. Waitrose was the first UK supermarket to install dedicated vegan sections in 134 of its stores in May. It has also launched a range of more than 40 vegan and vegetarian ready meals. Vegan dining out is also booming, the report notes, with the Good Food Guide highlighting restaurants with dedicated vegan menus for the first time this year after many high street chains and pubs increased their non-meat-and-dairy options. \u201cThis year, we\u2019ve seen vegan food go mainstream\u201d said Natalie Mitchell, Waitrose\u2019s head of brand development. \u201cWhether cooking at home, buying prepared food or trying the newly vegan-friendly restaurants, people are discovering that it tastes amazing.\u201d About 60% of vegans and 40% of vegetarians surveyed said they had adopted the lifestyle over the past five years, with 55% citing animal welfare concerns, 45% health reasons and 38% environmental issues. People in the 18-to-34 age group were more likely to switch to veganism, with much less enthusiasm among the over-55s. Many of the vegan and vegetarian respondents said they missed bacon sandwiches and pork scratchings. Waitrose\u2019s report is based on millions of the supermarket\u2019s transactions in shops and online, bolstered by a poll of 2,000 adults who shop across a range of retailers. The research chimed with consumers\u2019 growing fears among about their impact on the environment. Scientific research published this year found that without meat and dairy consumption, global farmland use could be reduced by more than 75% \u2013 an area equivalent to the US, China, the EU and Australia combined \u2013 and still feed the world. The Waitrose report found that 88% of respondents who saw the final episode of BBC\u2019s Blue Planet II about the effect of plastics on our oceans had since changed their behaviour. Waitrose said it had fielded an 800% increase in questions about plastics from customers in the wake of the episode. The supermarket also hailed jackfruit, a fleshy fruit grown in south-east Asia, Brazil and Africa, as a popular ingredient in its vegan-friendly ready meals and a meat-free alternative to pulled pork. In the drinks aisle, Waitrose singles out the popularity of organic wine. Sales have increased by 53% year-on-year, and it collection of 54 wines from 18 regions is set to grow further. Waitrose\u2019s managing director, Rob Collins, said: \u201cBeing mindful of how we live and eat has become a priority in today\u2019s world. As we become increasingly mindful of our own health, the wellbeing of our family and that of the planet, we\u2019re reshaping how we shop, cook and eat.\u201d",

A series of influential reports have said that avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way consumers can reduce their environmental impact on the planet, because farming animals is such a CO<sub>2</sub>-intensive process.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s extremely encouraging to learn how many Britons are choosing to reduce their consumption of animal products\u201d said Nick Palmer, the head of Compassion in World Farming UK. \u201cScience proves that the healthiest diet is one that is plant-heavy. By eating less meat, fish, eggs and dairy and choosing higher welfare when we do, we can all help animals, people and the planet.\u201d</p> <p>The Waitrose report is based on research among shoppers across all British supermarket chains. The retailer\u2019s executive chef, Jonathan Moore, said: \u201cVegetarianism has grown and evolved. More people dip in and out of it. There was a time when choosing a plant-based diet was about taking an ethical stand based on unwavering principles. For many, this distinction between vegetarians and meat-eaters still exists but for others the lines have blurred.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2018-10-31T16:18:52/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Vegan chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2018-10-31T16:18:52/embed.html\">Vegan chart</a> </figure>  <p>Publication of the findings represents awkward timing for Waitrose. It comes a day after the editor of its food magazine, William Sitwell, said he was stepping down after an email exchange with a freelance journalist emerged in which he mocked vegans and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/31/waitrose-magazine-editor-william-sitwell-steps-down-over-email-mocking-vegans\">suggested they should be force-fed meat</a>.</p> <p>The number of vegans in the UK, who shun all animal products including dairy and eggs, has grown fourfold in the past four years from 150,000 to 600,000, according to the <a href=\"https://www.vegansociety.com/\">Vegan Society</a>. </p> <p>Waitrose was the first UK supermarket to install dedicated vegan sections in 134 of its stores in May. It has also launched a range of more than 40 vegan and vegetarian ready meals. Vegan dining out is also booming, the report notes, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/06/good-pub-guide-2019-pubs-urged-to-keep-food-simple\">Good Food Guide </a>highlighting restaurants with dedicated vegan menus for the first time this year after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/04/bleeding-vegan-b12-burger-marstons-uk-pub\">many </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/04/bleeding-vegan-b12-burger-marstons-uk-pub\">high </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/04/bleeding-vegan-b12-burger-marstons-uk-pub\">street chains and pubs</a> increased their non-meat-and-dairy options.</p> <p>\u201cThis year, we\u2019ve seen vegan food go mainstream\u201d said Natalie Mitchell, Waitrose\u2019s head of brand development. \u201cWhether cooking at home, buying prepared food or trying the newly vegan-friendly restaurants, people are discovering that it tastes amazing.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/25/veganism-intensively-farmed-meat-dairy-soya-maize\">If you want to save the world, veganism isn\u2019t the answer | Isabella Tree</a> </p> </aside>  <p>About 60% of vegans and 40% of vegetarians surveyed said they had adopted the lifestyle over the past five years, with 55% citing animal welfare concerns, 45% health reasons and 38% environmental issues. People in the 18-to-34 age group were more likely to switch to veganism, with much less enthusiasm among the over-55s. Many of the vegan and vegetarian respondents said they missed bacon sandwiches and pork scratchings.</p> <p>Waitrose\u2019s report is based on millions of the supermarket\u2019s transactions in shops and online, bolstered by a poll of 2,000 adults who shop across a range of retailers. The research chimed with consumers\u2019 growing fears among about their impact on the environment. Scientific<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth\"> research</a> published this year found that without meat and dairy consumption, global farmland use could be reduced by more than 75% \u2013 an area equivalent to the US, China, the EU and Australia combined \u2013 and still feed the world.</p> <p>The Waitrose report found that 88% of respondents who saw the final episode of BBC\u2019s Blue Planet II about the effect of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/plastic\">plastics </a>on our oceans had since changed their behaviour. Waitrose said it had fielded an 800% increase in questions about plastics from customers in the wake of the episode.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2018-10-31T16:18:01/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Reusable drinks container chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2018-10-31T16:18:01/embed.html\">Reusable drinks container chart</a> </figure>  <p>The supermarket also hailed jackfruit, a fleshy fruit grown in south-east Asia, Brazil and Africa, as a popular ingredient in its vegan-friendly ready meals and a meat-free alternative to pulled pork. In the drinks aisle, Waitrose singles out the popularity of organic wine. Sales have increased by 53% year-on-year, and it collection of 54 wines from 18 regions is set to grow further. </p> <p>Waitrose\u2019s managing director, Rob Collins, said: \u201cBeing mindful of how we live and eat has become a priority in today\u2019s world.
