    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "While some British fans might have struggled to root for Germany in the World Cup final, they should be backing Europe's largest economy when the latest UK GDP numbers are published on Friday. One German manufacturer has been quietly involved in the domestic economy for more than a century and, in more recent years, has been in the vanguard of attempts to bolster the UK's industrial sector. Munich-based Siemens provided Britain's first electric street lighting in Godalming, Surrey, in 1881 and is now a big player here with nearly 14,000 employees, 13 factories and revenues of \u00a33.4bn. J\u00fcrgen Maier, the UK chief executive of Siemens, moved to Britain with his family as an 11-year-old in 1971, and was shocked by what he saw. His earlier years were spent in an affluent part of south-west Germany, a world away from the grit of Leeds where he found himself. \"I saw lots of crime. Not much after I arrived there were riots going in the city,\" he says. \"I saw a very sorry state of British city infrastructure. The city was run-down, it was dirty, it was grimy, the buildings were not clean, and you could just feel Britain was run-down.\" Sitting in a hotel in Liverpool where he is hosting \"Make it Britain\", part of the International Festival for Business, Maier turns his mind to the future. His new post, at the company he has worked for since 1986, comes as Britain is on the verge of \"reindustrialisation\", he says. The deep pain inflicted on the UK by the financial crisis has triggered a major rethink about what sustainable economic growth might look like in the future. The answer, it has been decided, lies in greater manufacturing might. The government has made growth in the sector a key ambition, seeking to lessen Britain's reliance on financial services and debt-fuelled spending, and increase the contribution of manufacturing and exports to the economy. Back in 2012, George Osborne outlined a hope to double exports to \u00a31 trillion by 2020, and put British factories at the centre of the 2014 budget, which the chancellor said was aimed at \"makers, doers and savers\". Renewed backing for manufacturing followed years of neglect under successive governments, as the country's priorities shifted towards services, the housing market and consumer and public spending. In 1948, British industry \u2013 including manufacturing, oil and gas extraction, and utilities \u2013 accounted for 41% of the economy. By 2013, it was just 14%. Maier says it could take 20 years before Britain again establishes itself as a global leader in manufacturing and innovation. Germany is the country to which British manufacturers aspire. When asked which country is the one they would associated with high-value manufacturing, 76% of the audience at the Make it Britain conference chose Germany. Just 9% said the UK. \"Within 10 years we will see some notable difference, but to get the same level of response about the UK in Spain, or in Germany, I think it will take 20 years,\" says Maier. \"But don't get me wrong: the world is starting to wake up and say these Jaguar Land Rovers are pretty good coming out of Britain.\" Siemens found itself at the centre of a political row in 2011 when its German-based train-manufacturing unit was selected as the preferred bidder for a \u00a31.4bn contract to build trains for the London Thameslink rail route \u2013 instead of the Bombardier factory in Derby. Amid the uproar, Siemens's existing UK presence was forgotten. It is investing \u00a3160m in a new factory in Hull, where new wind turbines will roll off the production line from 2016. The company's turbines already provide 50% of the UK's wind capacity. But the investment might not have been made had the government not produced its industrial strategy. \"Factory decisions are always heavily contended. There is massive competition because China will want to have the factory, America might want to have the factory, Germany obviously will,\" says Maier. \"So each factory will be fought for. What I'll say is that, five years ago, the chance of Britain winning such a debate was lower than it is today.\" But there are vast challenges, and the prospect of a British exit from the European Union does not sit well with Siemens. Not surprisingly, the German industrial giant, which has global revenues of \u00a360bn, would prefer the UK \u2013 its fourth biggest market \u2013 to remain within the union. For now Siemens is watching and waiting, but a Brexit would make Maier's life tougher when arguing the case for a new UK factory. \"For Siemens in the UK, without a question Britain remaining as part of the EU is better for us because it just makes things easier in terms of the ultimate tariffs that might arise between imports and exports. We feel strongly that Britain needs to be a strong player inside this common European market. \"Would it [affect] investment decisions between UK facilities versus other European cities? Yes it would. It would make life tougher for us as Siemens in the UK.\" An exit could trigger five years of uncertainty, Maier estimates, creating more caution among foreign companies with money to spend. He adds: \"One thing is for certain, uncertainty is a real poison for investment.\" The UK faces a huge challenge as it attempts to reinvent itself as an industrial leader. Maier says Britain is playing catch-up with a German manufacturing sector that is far ahead of the UK in both scale and confidence. \"Manufacturing is about half the scale of what it is in Germany just because we let it slip and we lost a lot of our manufacturing to other countries. We've had less of a strategic approach, we've had fewer communities built around manufacturing, so we don't have the confidence and the market climate to allow manufacturing businesses to invest more, and that's our big achilles heel.\" The UK's large financial services sector did not help either, according to Maier. The banks adopted a short-term approach to business, not wanting to put their money into capital-intensive engineering businesses where a longer-term view on returns is required. While the UK is good at the clever, technical stuff such as science and engineering, it lags behind on other key credentials such as leadership, he says. Part of the problem, he believes, is that British bosses tend to be less well travelled than peers from other countries. They're not the best at turning a small company into a large one. \"You get more of that if you're a better educated, more travelled business leader. In Britain we do need to think about our leadership training cultures. Are our business schools really delivering enough? But as a man leading the UK arm of a German company, he says there is not much between the two countries in terms of efficiency. \"The rates of productivity at British factories have been catching up to Germany levels and are pretty much on a par with them. That's without massive investment in innovation and capital equipment and automation in factories. Just imagine if we did that, how good productivity could be? We could leap ahead.\" For now, though, football is not the only area where Germany leads Britain.",

      "bodyText": "Euan Sutherland, who quit as chief executive of the Co-operative Group after only 10 months in the job amid a high-profile row over his remuneration package, is to receive a \u00a31m payoff. The size of the sum, the equivalent of 12 months' basic salary, has angered some Co-op members at a time when the organisation is looking to make up to 6,000 employees redundant. The Co-op insists such payments are routine. In a statement it said: \"Euan Sutherland was on a 12-month notice period as group chief executive. When he resigned in March, the board did not feel it appropriate to ask him to work his notice period and exercised its right to put him on gardening leave, which is normal practice for a senior executive.\" But critics say Sutherland chose to quit and therefore should not be entitled to a year's salary for doing nothing. Sutherland left the Co-op in March after details of his \u00a33.6m remuneration package \u2013 including a retention bonus, equivalent to 100% of his salary for his first year in the post, regardless of performance \u2013 were leaked to the Observer. Grassroots members were also furious that several other senior directors brought in by Sutherland were handed near \u00a31m salaries \u2013 and equivalent retention bonuses. The HR director, asked to leave the business after only 12 months' service, was given a \u00a32.5m payoff. Members were angry that the deals were agreed by the board but not shared with them. Shortly before his resignation, Sutherland took to Facebook to vent his frustration at the opposition to the remuneration scheme, saying that \"an individual, or individuals [are] determined to undermine me personally\". \"I think that members will be appalled at this news of a further management stitch-up,\" said Peter Hunt, former general secretary of the Co-operative party and chief executive of Mutuo, a body that promotes mutual business to opinion-formers and decision-makers. \"After the secret retention bonuses that made all of the executives into cash millionaires, we now hear that Euan Sutherland has been paid \u00a31m just for quitting.\" The controversy surrounding Co-op executive pay came after the group was brought almost to the brink when a \u00a31.5bn black hole was found in its bank's balance sheet. The bank's former chairman, Paul Flowers, pleaded guilty to possessing class-A drugs including crack cocaine and ketamine. Sutherland, who will not be receiving a retention bonus, is credited with saving the Co-op from sliding into the abyss. \"As chief executive, Euan led a team that saved the Co-operative Bank and started the process of recovery within the wider group,\" the Co-op said. But his attempts to shake up the 150-year-old organisation angered many members. A plan to transform the organisation, produced by City grandee Lord Myners, echoed Sutherland's call to \"modernise or die\" and recommended a shakeup of the Co-op's structure. But the issue of executive pay continues to prove toxic. At the group's recent annual meeting, members endorsed the Myners plan but backed motions opposing the remuneration packages for executives. Now news of the \u00a31m payoff to Sutherland is likely to increase their ire. \"Once again it shows the double standards of management: cutting jobs, cutting funding to co-operative organisations, while doubling their own pay,\" Hunt said. \"This shows the danger of a co-op dominated by its management. We need stronger member control to stop this behaviour. The reforms they are proposing will complete the stitch-up.\"",

      "bodyText": "A woman stands at the side of the road, looking mournfully at a flat tyre. Do you pull over and help her change it? If it was a man, would you do the same? If you answered yes to the first question but no to the second, you are reinforcing a \"damsel in distress\" syndrome that could have grave consequences for our economy. It is a term used by engineering apprentice Jessica Taylor. As the only female technician out of 180 at her company, Taylor has got used to men offering to carry heavy parts. Back at school, every time she used a drill in woodwork class, she would be waiting for the usual \"won't you let one of the boys do that?\" comments. Taylor has always loved taking things apart and seeing how they work. At primary school this did not make her stand out particularly, but by secondary school it did. That is where she started being \"the only girl\". Now she is the one woman of 40 students in her mechatronic engineering class at college, which is part of her apprenticeship at Avery Weigh-Tronix, a maker of industrial weighing machines. How young women like Taylor end up in the minority, and what happens to turn teenage girls off physics and, more widely, engineering is a question that has drawn plenty of research and just as many campaigns. One of these, Wise, was launched as Women Into Engineering and Science 30 years ago. The Women's Engineering Society emerged even earlier, in 1919, when women who had worked in engineering roles in the first world war lobbied to keep them when the war ended. Now this question must be top among the priorities of new education secretary Nicky Morgan, because for all the initiatives so far, the figures remain dismal. For more than 25 years, only a fifth of students taking physics to A-level have been girls, despite equal success between the sexes in GCSE physics and science, according to the Institute of Physics. That pattern of dwindling numbers continues as girls move into the workplace. Women made up just 4% of apprenticeship starts in engineering but more than 90% for hairdressing in 2011-12, according to unionlearn, the TUC's skills organisation. The UK has the lowest proportion of female engineers in the European Union, at less than 10%. There are too few women engineers in the UK \u2013 and there are too few engineers altogether. George Osborne will struggle to lead an effective \"march of the makers\" if the sector fails to draw on the whole working population. So the workforce misses out due to stereotyping and women themselves miss out, too. Engineering has long paid higher-than-average salaries, and pay in the sector is on the rise. The average advertised salary for engineering jobs is up 5% over the past year to \u00a336,391, according to jobs search engine Adzuna. If doors to the rising number of engineering jobs are to be opened to more girls, action is needed from four sides: business, the current workforce of female engineers, parents, and the education system. The business case is clear. Beyond the urgent need for a wider recruitment pool, businesses know that better diversity has a direct impact on their bottom line. And yet the Institution of Engineering and Technology found in its latest annual survey of skills that more than a third of employers were not taking action to attract women into the sector. That goes some way to explaining why half of the women who study engineering do not go on to jobs in the field, according to manufacturers' organisation EEF. It wants the industry to work harder to quash the idea that an engineer \"is the man who comes to fix the photocopier\", in the words of EEF policy adviser Verity O'Keefe. There are some promising examples. When consultancy Accenture was unable to meet its target of 50% female IT apprentices at its Newcastle office, it helped set up after-school coding clubs for girls. The company also runs app building workshops for girls under the Stemettes initiative. Other projects have seen women going into schools to talk about their careers, including under a recent national campaign called Your Life. For women who have become part of the minority in engineering, there is also a growing recognition of the need for mutual support. Keeping female engineers in the sector is still a problem, says Adeline Ginn, who founded Women in Rail after she noticed how many women in her industry were talking about a career change. She now runs self-confidence workshops and networking events for women. But for all the work by businesses and charities, too often girls' horizons are narrowed early on. Parents and schools are key to changing this. Apprentices like Taylor are the ones who resisted the \"that's not for you\" attitude of so many adults around them. But it should not be just the defiant girls who make it. Both young girls and boys will be making sandcastles on sweltering beaches this weekend. Parents and schools need to ask how they can keep them all interested in designing, building and fixing. Our neighbouring countries, where engineering is held in higher esteem, are way ahead on this. All of us in the UK would do well to adopt the mantra of the Women's Engineering Society: \"Girls can't what?\"",

    "webTitle": "China syndrome bodes ill for GlaxoSmithKline's results", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "We've had the sex and the drugs, but sadly no rock'n'roll (so far) in the saga of GlaxoSmithKline's murky dealings in China. As you may recall, the company is under investigation for bribery, including allegations that its sales executives paid billions of yuan to doctors to encourage them to use its drugs. Latest revelations in the lurid affair included news that a sex tape of the former head of its China division, Mark Reilly, and his Chinese girlfriend was emailed to 13 company executives last year, including chief executive Sir Andrew Witty. On top of that, the company admitted last week that in 2001 it had fired staff in China for bribing officials, in a case that pre-dates the current allegations. All of this has distracted from the nuts and bolts of the company's business. On Wednesday it will report second-quarter results, which are expected to show a 12% fall in revenues to around \u00a35.9bn, thanks to foreign exchange volatility and competition from generics. It is clear Glaxo is going through a transition phase. Sales of its key respiratory drug, Advair, are under pressure and sales of newer drugs have yet to pick up. The company has also sold its Lucozade and Ribena brands, and a product portfolio worth around \u00a38bn is currently on offer to private equity bidders. There was also a complex transaction with Novartis, with Glaxo swapping its cancer treatment division for Novartis' vaccine business and entering into a consumer healthcare joint venture. Analysts at Charles Stanley said: \"Following completion of these deals (expected in the first half of 2015) Glaxo is to make a \u00a34bn capital return to shareholders. We will be looking for confirmation that these deals are still on track to complete.\" As for China, first-quarter sales were down around 20% \u2013 and given all that's going on, the City does not expect any immediate improvement. Perhaps Glaxo could amuse hacks waiting on the conference call with a track by China Crisis (OK, not strictly rock'n'roll) to complete the set. Cable's royal road to recriminations Vince Cable must wish he'd been out of the office when the decision was made to push the button on the Royal Mail flotation. Ever since the October listing, the business secretary has heard nothing but accusations that he sold it too cheaply, culminating in a report earlier this month in which MPs criticised the privatisation process, which they said cost taxpayers \u00a31bn. To make it worse, the company is rarely out of the headlines. Last week its French business was caught up in an investigation into alleged price-fixing, and two events this week will again throw the spotlight on it and, almost inevitably, its share price. On Tuesday a first-quarter trading update is expected to show overall revenues up 2%, with letter volumes down 4% but parcel revenues up 5%. There is no doubt times are getting tougher, with competition from rival TNT Post progressing faster than expected and Amazon - a key parcel customer - developing its own distribution system. Two days later comes its annual meeting, when its new army of shareholders can quiz the board. Unlike Cable, they must be happy with the share price since flotation, despitethe concerns about trading. And the other bad news for Cable is that even the sellers among City analysts put a target well above the 330p flotation price. Presumably Cable still thinks this is \"froth\" though. Apple's IBM link beats everything They used to say no one ever got fired for buying IBM, and although that was many mainframes and PCs ago, Apple seems to be hoping some of that past corporate cachet rubs off. In a move almost as unlikely as Michael Gove joining the NUT, the two companies which were once such bitter rivals announced they were getting together to develop iPhone and iPad apps and services for business users. The move will also mean IBM's sales force pushing Apple products to its own corporate customers. More details could come when Apple unveils third-quarter figures on Tuesday. Analysts expect revenues of around $38bn, benefiting from a weak performance from rival Samsung. As is the way, the world's Apple followers will be seeking hints of new products, with the iPhone 6 said to be starting production shortly, for launch around September. Analysts at Barclays said an iWatch could be launched later in the year, with a focus on lifestyle and personal fitness: \"Nike could be a major partner for Apple in this initiative. We expect this product to ship after Thanksgiving and view it as a very attractive companion product for current iPhone users.\" Then there is the \u00a31.8bn acquisition of Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine's Beats Electronics, partly designed to help Apple overcome declining digital music sales due to streaming services. European regulators are due to decide by the end of July whether to approve the deal with the headphone maker.",

      "body": "<p>We've had the sex and the drugs, but sadly no rock'n'roll (so far) in the saga of GlaxoSmithKline's murky dealings in China.</p> <p>As you may recall, the company is under investigation for bribery, including allegations that its sales executives paid billions of yuan to doctors to encourage them to use its drugs. Latest revelations in the lurid affair included news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/30/glaxosmithkline-pharmaceuticals-industry\" title=\"\">a sex tape of the former head of its China division, Mark Reilly, and his Chinese girlfriend was emailed to 13 company executives last year</a>, including chief executive Sir Andrew Witty.</p> <p>On top of that, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/17/us-gsk-china-idUSKBN0FM0VL20140717?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews\" title=\"\">the company admitted last week </a>that in 2001 it had fired staff in China for bribing officials, in a case that pre-dates the current allegations.</p> <p>All of this has distracted from the nuts and bolts of the company's business. On Wednesday it will report second-quarter results, which are expected to show a 12% fall in revenues to around \u00a35.9bn, thanks to foreign exchange volatility and competition from generics.</p> <p>It is clear Glaxo is going through a transition phase. Sales of its key respiratory drug, Advair, are under pressure and sales of newer drugs have yet to pick up. The company has also sold its Lucozade and Ribena brands, and a product portfolio worth around \u00a38bn is currently on offer to private equity bidders.</p> <p>There was also a complex transaction with Novartis, with Glaxo swapping its cancer treatment division for Novartis' vaccine business and entering into a consumer healthcare joint venture.</p> <p>Analysts at Charles Stanley said: \"Following completion of these deals (expected in the first half of 2015) Glaxo is to make a \u00a34bn capital return to shareholders. We will be looking for confirmation that these deals are still on track to complete.\"</p> <p>As for China, first-quarter sales were down around 20% \u2013 and given all that's going on, the City does not expect any immediate improvement. Perhaps Glaxo could amuse hacks waiting on the conference call with a track by China Crisis (OK, not strictly rock'n'roll) to complete the set.</p> <h2>Cable's royal road to recriminations<br></h2> <p>Vince Cable must wish he'd been out of the office when the decision was made to push the button on the Royal Mail flotation. Ever since the October listing, the business secretary has heard nothing but accusations that he sold it too cheaply, culminating in a report earlier this month in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/11/royal-mail-sale-lost-1bn-says-select-committee\" title=\"\">MPs criticised the privatisation process, which they said cost taxpayers \u00a31bn.</a></p> <p>To make it worse, the company is rarely out of the headlines. Last week its French business was caught up in an investigation into alleged price-fixing, and two events this week will again throw the spotlight on it and, almost inevitably, its share price.</p> <p>On Tuesday a first-quarter trading update is expected to show overall revenues up 2%, with letter volumes down 4% but parcel revenues up 5%. There is no doubt times are getting tougher, with competition from rival TNT Post progressing faster than expected and Amazon - a key parcel customer - developing its own distribution system.</p> <p>Two days later comes its annual meeting, when its new army of shareholders can quiz the board. Unlike Cable, they must be happy with the share price since flotation, despitethe concerns about trading.</p> <p>And the other bad news for Cable is that even the sellers among City analysts put a target well above the 330p flotation price. Presumably Cable still thinks this is \"froth\" though.</p> <h2>Apple's IBM link beats everything<br></h2> <p>They used to say no one ever got fired for buying IBM, and although that was many mainframes and PCs ago, Apple seems to be hoping some of that past corporate cachet rubs off.</p> <p>In a move almost as unlikely as Michael Gove joining the NUT, the two companies which were once such bitter rivals announced they were getting together to develop iPhone and iPad apps and services for business users.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Former chancellor Kenneth Clarke has cast serious doubt on the underlying strength of the British economy, saying there is a \"long, long way\" to go before it is competitive enough to deliver sustainable growth and compete with emerging powers such as China and Brazil. In an interview with the Observer to mark the end of an illustrious career that has spanned more than 40 years in government, Clarke says Britain has to break out of the \"ludicrous cycle\" of house price booms followed by crashes, and must focus on creating a productive manufacturing base in tandem with vibrant financial and other service industries. Admitting to tensions with David Cameron since the 2010 election \u2013 and voicing frustration at attempts by the Tory press office to keep him off TV and radio \u2013 Clarke insists that on economic policy he is completely \"on message\" with the government. However, in stark contrast to recent bullish messages about growth and job creation from the prime minister and chancellor, Clarke stresses that the economy is \"fragile\", vulnerable to shocks, and still lacks the strong productive base necessary to compete long-term in global markets. \"It's not firmly enough rooted on a proper balance between manufacturing and a wide range of services and financial services,\" he says. \"I mean, we have this mystery of why we can't get productivity to start rising again.\" Clarke says the coalition has saved the country from economic calamity by reining in spending, and declares himself a \"great fan\" of George Osborne. But he fights shy of triumphalism, making it clear that \"a bit of cyclical upswing\" in recent months should delude no one into believing the job anywhere near done. While he believes that the Conservatives are likely to be the largest party at the next election, and should use their economic record so far as the trump card against Labour, he doubts that they can win outright. Looking back across a career that included spells as health secretary, education secretary, chancellor of the exchequer and justice secretary, and three unsuccessful campaigns to lead the Conservative party, he says that the Tories' internal splits over Europe are wider than ever, and his party is no longer the disciplined fighting force that it was when he first became an MP, in 1970. \"I belong to a Conservative party that used to be able to win elections \u2026 it was the self-discipline of the party that was extraordinary,\" he says. Now, however, he sees a lot of Tory MPs who regard being members of the governing party as \"a secondary consideration\" to banging the anti-EU drum. Winning a majority in May next year is a \"mountain to climb\", he says. Clarke, now 74, stepped down from the Cabinet on Tuesday in Cameron's reshuffle, but says he will stand again at next year's election, partly in order to fight to keep Britain in the EU in the event of an in/out referendum, which Cameron has promised to hold by the end of 2017. While he avoids any direct criticism of the prime minister, he says he thinks his own appointment after the 2010 election as justice secretary \"turned out to be a slight mistake\" because, as someone on the left of the party, \"unfortunately my views didn't coincide with No 10's \u2026 David and I didn't fall out exactly, [but] there was constant friction.\" He also accuses the Tory press office of trying to keep him off the media and says he had a \"great row with them\" a few months ago when they told the BBC he was ill and couldn't go on Question Time, when, in fact, he was in rude health and raring to go. When he rang the producer, he says, \"she said 'I'm told you're ill'. After that I got even more freelance.\" A vote to leave the EU would, Clarke says, leave Cameron and future PMs as diminished figures on the world stage, and the UK unable to shape economic rules that would directly affect this country's economic future. \"Being prime minister will be a less important job if we leave the European Union. You'd become a minor player in all kinds of situations.\" Deriding the view of Eurosceptics that the UK could forge its own bilateral agreements outside the EU, he says: \"The idea that the United Kingdom could negotiate a serious trade deal with the United States on its own \u2026 is ridiculous.\" Housing bubbles followed by collapses remain a British disease that has now spread outside London. \"I very much hope the British are going to get out of this ludicrous cycle of ridiculous housing booms followed by housing crashes,\" he says, adding that Bank of England governor Mark Carney is now addressing the problem. The focus for the next five years must be on pushing on with reforms to create higher levels of skills, more training, better education, more research and development and \"boosting science which is difficult with the British who aren't very interested in science. All that. We have got a long, long way to go.\" Echoing one of the central messages of Labour leader Ed Miliband, he says: \"We don't want to be a low-skills, low-productivity, long-hours economy.\" He adds: \"We're only halfway through \u2026 We've saved the country from calamity but we've got a long way to go before we get a competitive economy, with sustainable levels of growth and all that.\" \u2022 Kenneth Clarke: I had a lot of views, but they didn't coincide with No 10's",
