      "bodyText": "Prices in British shops have moved into their third year of decline as a result of widespread supermarket discounting and cheaper fresh food , according to new industry figures. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said shop prices in May were down 1.9% on last year\u2019s levels, unchanged from April\u2019s rate of decline and the 25th straight month of deflation. The fall will reinforce expectations that the broader official measure of inflation in the UK will remain low for some months to come after turning negative in April. The BRC found food prices again fell 0.9% in May while non-food deflation held at 2.5%. Within those categories, fresh food fell at a record pace of 1.9% thanks to meat, milk, cheese and eggs all being cheaper than a year ago, according to the BRC report with market research company Nielsen. Comparable records began in December 2006. Shop price deflation enters a third year \u201cRetailers continue to use price cuts and promotions to stimulate sales which is helping to maintain shop price deflation, and we see little evidence to suggest that prices will rise in the near future,\u201d said Mike Watkins, Nielsen\u2019s head of retailer and business insight. He predicted that discounting will help keep the official consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation low for some time. \u201cWith many food retailers still using price cuts to attract new shoppers, this is lowering the cost of the weekly shop and so the overall CPI figure in the UK. Deflation and price led competition will continue to be a key driver of sales growth for some time yet,\u201d added Watkins. In non-food, the BRC said deep deflation was recorded in clothing and footwear, electricals and books, stationery and home entertainment. Health and beauty remained in inflationary territory. For now, economists and policymakers appear unconcerned about inflation turning negative, saying it will likely boost consumer spending. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has told people to \u201cenjoy it while it lasts\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Alexis Tsipras\u2019s decision to head to Brussels on Wednesday night suggests he\u2019s not prepared to accept the creditors\u2019 new proposals without a fight. By meeting Jean-Claude Juncker, Tsipras may be hoping to get support for his own 47-page list of proposals, rather than cave in (or be seen to cave in) to the former Troika... The financial markets, incidentally, are pricing in an eventual Greek debt restructuring, sooner or later..... Just when we thought things were over...... Athens journalists are reporting that prime minister Alexis Tsipras will visit Brussels tomorrow. He\u2019ll be carrying the Greek proposal to end the deadlock, rather than the one being sent by creditors to Athens tomorrow..... OK, events really seem to have calmed down for the night, so I\u2019m going to wrap up here. Big day tomorrow, when we learn how the offer crafted by Greece\u2019s lenders goes down in Athens. Will it be acceptable to the Athens government, paving the way to unlock bailout funds and avert a default that could rock Europe to its core? Tune in on Wednesday to find out..... GW Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, sums up the situation tonight: A full moon is rising over Athens tonight. A good omen?.... Reuters is now also reporting that the ECB, IMF and EC have agreed a cash-for-reforms proposal to put to Greece on Wednesday (as Peter Spiegel tweeted earlier) PPS: Christine Lagarde is expected to brief the IMF board about the situation in Greece, having jetted back across the Atlantic following the Berlin talks. She\u2019ll need good answers about Greek debt sustainability, and the prospect of the Fund receiving its \u20ac1.6bn this month. PS: The latest word from Brussels is that creditors have completed a deal to present to Athens on Wednesday, the FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel reports. That means technical teams have finished their work, which was prompted by last night\u2019s emergency meeting in Berlin. Roll on Wednesday, when we\u2019ll also be treated to a press conference with ECB chief Mario Draghi #cannotwait With Monday\u2019s late night meeting but seemingly no proposals yet agreed by either Greece or its creditors, investors continue to be nervous as the clock ticks down towards the country running out of money. With eurozone inflation coming in higher than expected, there was also the concern that the ECB\u2019s supportive bond buying programme might end sooner than anyone anticipated. So markets had another nervous day, with the final scores showing: The FTSE 100 fell 25.31 points or 0.36% to 6928.27 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.94% to 11,328.80 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.41% lower at 5004.46 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.6% to 23,576.16 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.3% at 11,271.4 The Athens market fell 2.47% to 804.96 But on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shrugged off early Greece jitters, and is currently up 34 points or 0.18%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up although we may be back if anything major develops. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over in Athens, the minister of state Nikos Pappas has also racheted up the pressure this afternoon describing the proposal the Greek government has made as \u201ccomplete, unified and solid,\u201d reports our correspondent Helena Smith. \u201cGreece last night officially submitted a text of proposals to the institutions that were complete, unified and solid just as the decision on the 20 February called for,\u201d said the minister referring to the decision of creditors to extend Greece\u2019s current bailout until the end of June. \u201cWhoever has something specific to say about the proposal, so be it. There is no more time to waste. As the prime minister Alexis Tsipras himself said recently, \u201cwhoever wants a solution should contribute now, whoever doesn\u2019t want a solution should hold their tongue.\u201d The statement is important not least because Pappas, who rarely speaks in public, is Tsipras\u2019 closest ally. The Glasgow-educated politician is the only man to have attended the tete-a-tetes the Greek prime minister has had with Merkel in recent months. More support for Greece from the European Central Bank (ahead of tomorrow\u2019s meeting) it would appear: That would be an increase of \u20ac500m. And another suggestion the two sides - Greece and its creditors - remain some way apart in their separate proposals: Here\u2019s the latest summary from Reuters about the state of play between Greece and its creditors: Greece\u2019s creditors are close to finishing a draft agreement to put to the leftist government in Athens, a source close to the talks said on Tuesday, injecting new momentum into long-running negotiations to release aid for the cash-strapped country. Hours earlier, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said Athens had submitted its own proposal to lenders - an apparent effort to pre-empt a take-it-or-leave-it offer by the creditors and to show Greek voters that Athens made its move first. The statements of proposal and counter-proposal came after leaders of Germany, France and the lending institutions held emergency talks on the Greek debt crisis in Berlin late on Monday in a sign of top-level concern about the impasse. But: And: The US concern about the situation in the eurozone has been reinforced by a speech in Washington by Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard. Although mostly about the US economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy, one of the points Brainard mentions involves the eurozone: Recently, the euro area has seen some encouraging data on retail sales, industrial production, and inflation, auguring well for some sustained improvement in aggregate demand within the euro area. Nonetheless, there remain risks and uncertainties surrounding foreign growth that could prolong or intensify foreign headwinds going forward. Most immediately, negotiations between Greece and its creditors are challenging, and the risk of further deterioration cannot be ruled out. While the euro area has broadened its policy toolkit and most member states have made significant strides in building resilience in the past couple of years, the recovery is still fragile in several member states, and vulnerabilities to financial stresses remain. Reuters has further comments from Brainard: 02-Jun-2015 15:38:32 - BRAINARD SAYS COMPROMISE OVER GREECE STILL POSSIBLE 02-Jun-2015 15:38:54 - BRAINARD SAYS FED \u201cVERY ATTENTIVE\u201d TO POTENTIAL VOLATILITY IF GREEK TALKS DON\u2019T WORK OUT A quick recap.... The Greek bailout crisis is rattling towards a crescendo, as its creditors scramble to put the finishing touches to a proposal to send to Athens \u2013 possibly by the end of the day. Last night\u2019s emergency summit in Berlin has been followed by further technical work today, as the IMF, the ECB and the European Commission. Lenders hope to get the proposal onto Alexis Tsipras\u2019s desk within hours, paving the way to a \u2018political agreement\u2019 by Friday. The WSJ suggests creditors are prepared to compromise on some key issues..... ....while the FT reports that Brussels is also considering a new plan to extend Greece\u2019s bailout over the summer. But there is also \u201cstrong foreboding\u201d in Europe\u2019s capitals that the crisis could spiral out of control. Our Europe editor Ian Traynor reports: The radical Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and his governing hard-left Syriza movement \u201cis underestimating unity in the rest of the EU,\u201d said a senior EU official involved in five years of negotiations with the Greeks. \u201cThat will probably cause default or breakdown. No one is trying to prevent it anymore.\u201d Greek insiders they\u2019ve heard nothing official yet. And prime minister Alexis Tsipras is refusing to be bounced into an ultimatum by lenders. Instead, Tsipras has fired his own 47-page proposal to creditors, which suggests we could face further nailbiting deadlock. He told a press conference today that: \u201cWe are not waiting for them to submit a proposal, Greece is submitting a plan - it is now clear that the decision on whether they want to adjust to realism ... the decision rests with the political leadership of Europe.\u201d There are also rumblings among Tsipras\u2019s own party that elections could be called, if whatever creditors propose is not acceptable. 28 June and 5 July have been mooted (good luck to anyone booking holidays this summer). But the Bank of Greece governor, Yannis Stournaras, has warned that most Greeks want to stay in the euro. Hopes of a deal sent the euro surging today, with the latest eurozone inflation data providing extra rocket fuel. Euro CPI rose by 0.3% annually in May. But eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem calmed the excitement, saying a deal isn\u2019t theoretically possible this week, and more work is needed.... What does Dijsselbloem mean by saying a Greek deal is \u2018not theoretically possible this week\u2019? He\u2019s probably concerned that any deal would need to be signed off by his eurogroup, which next meets on June 18. Some European parliaments may also want a vote. But as flagged earlier, creditors are hoping for a \u2018political deal\u2019 by Friday, and a concrete agreement a week later. Dijsselbloem may also be irked that he missed out on the Berlin mini-summit. Oh dear. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the eurogroup of finance minister, has just dampened our hopes. EUROGROUP HEAD DIJSSELBLOEM SAYS: GREECE DEAL NOT THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE THIS WEEK EUROGROUP\u2019S DIJSSELBLOEM SAYS GREEK GOVERNMENT MUST BE \u201cHONEST WITH VOTERS\u201d ABOUT FINANCES Over in Athens the government is still insisting that it has had no contact with creditors since the 5-way meeting of institutional heads, the EU president and German and French leaders last night, reports Helena Smith. In a tersely worded statement, prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist led coalition announced: \u201cThe Greek government has not received an agreement plan from the institutions, nor has there been contact between the prime minister or some other official of a government with corresponding officials from the institutions.\u201d But detailed reports regarding the content of Greece\u2019s proposal are beginning to filter through with government sources saying the proposal runs to 47 pages and is divided into \u201celements\u201d agreed by teams of technical experts, known as the Brussels group, and \u201celements\u201d that have yet to be resolved. The anti-austerity government, has it seems, agreed to overhaul the social security system and roll back on pension reform - but is still insisting that the primary surplus demanded of Athens be less than 1%. It is also believed to be digging in its heels on its primary demand of reducing what it has repeatedly said is an unsustainable debt load - perhaps the biggest impediment to any kind of deal for creditors. Expressions of optimism are coming in thick and fast with officials saying they expect an agreement to be sealed within days. The governor of the Bank of Greece and former finance minister Yannis Stournaras (no friend of the government) has also said that he believes the distance between the two sides is finally being bridged and that a compromise is not far away. Stournaras reminded an audience at London\u2019s Chatham House that 80% of Greeks did not want euro exit and 65% were willing to make further sacrifices to stay in the single currency. There is growing angst in the eurozone\u2019s corridors of power about the looming ultimatum for Greece, reports our Europe editor, Ian Traynor. Last night\u2019s emergency talks in Berlin have shown that a political deal will be needed, but the failure of creditors to reach a common position is causing alarm: In Brussels and eurozone capitals, there is a strong sense of foreboding that the extreme brinkmanship on both sides is careering out of control and will end badly. The radical Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and his governing hard-left Syriza movement \u201cis underestimating unity in the rest of the EU,\u201d said a senior EU official involved in five years of negotiations with the Greeks. \u201cThat will probably cause default or breakdown. No one is trying to prevent it anymore.\u201d Several eurozone countries are particularly reluctant to take a soft line with Greece: \u201cBelgian, Finnish, Dutch opinion is hardening. The Germans are actually the softies compared to the Slovakians and Estonians.\u201d We\u2019ll have more from Ian later... This episode of the Greek crisis will probably end with another helping of EU fudge, writes our economics editor, Larry Elliott. After all, a Grexit is too alarming and Athens remains unwilling to cave in: Greece does not want to leave the euro. Merkel does not want to be the politician held responsible for derailing the European project. So there is a temptation to do what Europe has done throughout its six-year sovereign debt crisis: play for time. This would involve Greece\u2019s creditors providing bridging finance that would allow Tsipras to meet the series of debt repayments due this summer and for a referendum to be held on whether the Greeks believe yet more austerity is a price worth paying for staying in the euro. Athens would give a solemn commitment to step up the pace of economic reform; the troika would say that any backsliding will result in the money being cut off... So if Greece\u2019s lender are nearly ready to fire over a proposal to Athens, what timescale are we looking at? The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel reports that the IMF, ECB and EU have \u2018narrowed their differences\u2019, and hope to agree a final text outlining what is expected from Athens by the end of Tuesday. Officials are hoping that a \u201cpolitical agreement on principles\u201d can be hammered out before this Friday, when Athens must repay \u20ac300m to the IMF, he writes. A full deal could then be agreed by the end of next week, officials in Brussels reckon. However, there\u2019s still one sticking point -- the budget surpluses that Greece must sign up to (as the old targets are now unachievable given the economic turmoil this year) The IMF remains sceptical and continues to seek assurances that eurozone governments would agree to restructure Greek debt \u2014 mostly now held by EU creditors \u2014 if a credible reform programme is not agreed and the targets are not met. Peter also has another important piece of news... the creditors are also devising a way of getting Greece through the summer once its bailout programme expires on 30 June, he reports. One wheeze is to \u2018repurpose\u2019 almost \u20ac11bn of funds allocated to recapitalise Greece\u2019s banking sector as general purpose bailout aid, which could then be used to repay the ECB in July and August. That would \u201ckick the can down the road\u201d until the autumn, as the ECB could continue to provide emergency liquidity to Greece\u2019s banks. BUT.... is this proposal going to be acceptable to Alexis Tsipras, and the more hardline members of his party, who have been making noises about elections this morning? The euro has jumped on reports that Greece\u2019s creditors are close to agreeing a proposal to send to Athens. It\u2019s a confusing picture (as so often!); Reuters is hearing that a draft deal is almost ready. GREECE\u2019S EU/IMF CREDITORS CLOSE TO COMPLETING DRAFT OF DEAL TO PUT TO GREEK GOVT - SOURCE CLOSE TO TALKS The Wall Street Journal also reckons an accord is imminent, with creditors prepared to compromise a little: Marcus Walker, the WSJ\u2019s European economics editor, writes: Greece\u2019s creditors have reached a consensus on the terms of a proposed deal to put to the Greek government, according to two people familiar with the talks. Officials representing European institutions and the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday morning completed the draft of an agreement to unlock bailout aid for Greece, after key European and IMF leaders met in Berlin late Monday to overcome differences between Greece\u2019s creditors, they said. Eurozone governments and the IMF have agreed to press Greece for far-reaching economic overhauls, while the IMF has softened its insistence that Europe offer explicit commitments to relieve some of Greece\u2019s debt burden, the people said.... Caution is needed here; there\u2019s no guarantee that any proposal from the creditors will match the \u2018comprehensive plan\u2019 pinged to Berlin by the Greeks. But still, any sign of progress is being cheered by the market, sending the euro to its highest level in 10 days. Speculation about elections at the end of June continues to swirl in Greece, this time from the junior member of the country\u2019s coalition: Many papers are being exchanged between Athens and its creditors, says European Commission spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt. She\u2019s taking the daily media briefing in Brussels right now, and was asked about these \u201ccomprehensive proposals\u201d which Greece apparently whizzed over to the Berlin talks last night. This is known as \u2018paperology\u2019 in the trade; the EU doesn\u2019t like talking about it. Breidthardt also cautioned against being over-optimistic, warning that the two sides \u201care not there yet\u201d. Looks like Alexis Tsipras got a warm reception from employees at the Greek education ministry this morning: EU insiders say the proposals sent by Greece last night weren\u2019t comprehensive enough.... Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras is insisting he\u2019s not prepared to be bounced into a deal by creditors. The Syriza leader insists that his government sent \u201crealistic\u201d plans of its own to Berlin last night, which he urges them to back... He says: \u201cWe have submitted a realistic plan for Greece to exit the crisis....and end divisions in Europe. \u201cWe are not waiting for them to submit a proposal, Greece is submitting a plan - it is now clear that the decision on whether they want to adjust to realism ... the decision rests with the political leadership of Europe.\u201d But EU officials say that Merkel et al considered a paper drawn up by the Commission, showing the \u2018core principles\u2019 they need to meet to get a deal. Alexis Tsipras adds that he is optimistic that an agreement will be reached in time. I believe European leader will respect our proposals, he tells his audience in the Athens education ministry. Back in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras is speaking now - repeating that Europe\u2019s leaders are the only people who can deliver a solid agreement. He also revealed that Greece sent a \u201ccomprehensive proposal\u201d to its lenders last night [Tsipras held a cabinet meeting with top ministers on Monday evening]. GREEK PM TSIPRAS SAYS THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE TOUGH, WE ARE DETERMINED, WE ARE NEGOTIATING WITH A STRATEGY IN DIFFICULT CONDITIONS GREEK PM TSIPRAS SAYS GREECE HAS SPECIFIC, REALISTIC PROPOSALS, WE HAVE ALREADY MADE CONCESSIONS GREEK PM TSIPRAS SAYS GREECE SUBMITTED A COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSAL FOR AGREEMENT TO LENDERS ON MONDAY NIGHT GREEK PM TSIPRAS SAYS DECISION ON AGREEMENT RESTS ON POLITICAL LEADERS IN EUROPE The European Central Bank might have to revise its forecasts higher at tomorrow\u2019s monetary policy meeting, reckons Credit Agricole\u2019s Fred Ducrozet. Breaking: Inflation across the eurozone has started rising again, and by more than many economists expected. The eurozone consumer prices index, which tracks the cost of living across the euro area, rose by 0.3% in May, having been flat in April (and negative since January). The City had expected a reading of 0.2%. Inflation in the service sector rose by 1.3%, up from 1.0% in April, while food, alcohol &amp; tobacco prices rose by 1.2% (up from 1.0%). And the prices of non-energy industrial goods rose by 0.3%. Cheaper oil prices continued to drag the cost of living down, but not as much as previously. Energy prices were down by 5% year-on-year, compared with -5.8% in April). And core inflation, which strips out volatile factors, rose by 0.9%, indicating that underlying price pressures are increasing. It shows that the ECB\u2019s huge quantitative easing programme (buying up \u20ac60bn of bonds with new money each month) is having a real impact. There is much chatter in Athens this morning that the country could hold elections if Greece isn\u2019t given the \u201chonourable compromise\u201d that it wants, says our correspondent Helena Smith. It is indicative of the mood in Athens this morning that even the mild-manned deputy premier Yannis Dragasakis has come out all guns. \u201cAs a government neither do we accept ultimatums not do we bow to blackmail,\u201d tweeted the ex communist who is now in charge of the anti-austerity coalition\u2019s economic policy. If an honourable compromise isn\u2019t reached \u201cthen we\u2019ll have elections,\u201d the labour minister, Panos Skourletis, told SKAI TV. \u201cWhen you are elected you are not given carte blanche,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIf a deal is achieved that is not deemed honourable and promoting of compromise, the people will have to be asked before we sign it.\u201d Nikos Filis, the governing Syriza party\u2019s representative in parliament, also insisted this morning that in the event of an agreement not being endorsed by government MPS (but being voted through with the help of the opposition) the country would necessarily have to go to the polls. The great Greek rumour mill is suggesting that fresh polls could be held on June 28. It should be noted that prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 radical left Syriza party is by far the most popular party - and would almost certainly win an elections hands down. Europe or indeed the IMF would not be dealing with a new face in power! After a calm start, Europe\u2019s stock markets have just fallen into the red, with the FTSE 100 shedding 0.8% or 55 points. Traders are trying to deduce whether last night\u2019s meeting in Berlin between Merkel, Hollands, Draghi, Lagarde and Juncker is a positive sign, or not. KBC strategist Mathias van der Jeugt says: \u201cThe fact that five such political and financial heavyweights met about Greece means they are trying to force a break in the political deadlock and that\u2019s a positive development that\u2019s likely to lift risk sentiment. But we will have to wait to see the Greek reaction.\u201d The Athens stock market is flat this morning. And the euro has risen by 0.35% against the US dollar, to $1.0966. Germany\u2019s minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, is urging Greece to \u201cembrace\u201d its creditors efforts to reach a deal and avoid bankruptcy: GERMAN ECON MIN GABRIEL SAYS THE CONSEQUENCES OF A GREEK BANKRUPTCY WOULD BE \u201cGIGANTIC\u201d FOR EUROPE GERMAN ECON MIN GABRIEL SAYS HOPES GREECE WILL EMBRACE ATTEMPTS BY MERKEL AND OTHERS TO GET A DEAL But it\u2019s not clear that Greece actually has anything to cling onto, as Athens officials say they\u2019ve not yet received any new information from the IMF, ECB and EC. Just in: Germany\u2019s unemployment total has fallen by another 6,000. That leaves the country\u2019s jobless rate at its record low of 6.4%. A Greek official has told Reuters that Athens hasn\u2019t yet received any text or document from its creditors following last night\u2019s meeting. Greece is confident it can meet its next debt repayment, \u20ac300m to the IMF on Friday, as long as it has an agreement with creditors (even if new funds haven\u2019t been released). Over to Spain\u2019s briefly...and the country\u2019s unemployment crisis has eased a little. The number of people out of work fell by almost 118,000 in May, a slightly bigger drop than expected. That brings the total out of work down to 4.215m. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has just revealed that Greece has offered new proposals on pensions reforms. He told France Inter radio that: \u201cWe are starting to work in depth on pensions. The Greek government has made some first proposals and the pros and cons are being considered.\u201d Greece\u2019s creditors have been pushing hard for reform of its pension scheme, which they claim is too generous and encourages citizens to retire early. Many pensioners, though, have already seen their payments slashed since the crisis began -- and in some cases still find themselves supporting the rest of their family. My colleague Helena Smith covered this crucial issue last month: Fight to save the Greek pension takes centre stage in Brussels and Athens There are plenty of rumours and theories swirling this morning, about what the heads of Germany, France, the IMF, ECB and EC discussed last night. Here\u2019s a few: Nikos Filis, the parliamentary spokesman of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s ruling Syriza party, insists Greece will not be bounced into a \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 offer from its creditors. We can\u2019t sign an agreement that was incompatible with our anti-austerity programme, he told Antenna TV, saying: \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about an ultimatum... which is not within the framework of the popular mandate, it is obvious that the government cannot co-sign and accept it.\u201d (quotes via Reuters) Greece\u2019s labour minister, Panos Skourletis, has warned that Athens cannot make more compromises. Any concessions must come from the Greek creditors, he argued, as part of a \u2018political deal\u2019. He told Skai TV this morning that: \u201cThere is no room for more compromises. We are waiting for the other side to assume its responsibilities.\u201d Merkel, Lagarde, Draghi, Hollande and Juncker worked on a technical paper last night prepared by the commission, showing possible ways of reaching a deal , according to the Financial Times. One official said there were no new concessions to Athens in the commission paper. Rather, it was intended to spell out the core principles creditors need to conclude a deal. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, has long argued that Athens accepts 70% of the existing bailout programme, and creditors are hoping any compromise reached in Berlin could serve as the 70% Mr Varoufakis and Mr Tsipras can accept. Officials cautioned that the final creditor position may need to be fleshed out in the coming days, but their intention would be to present it to Athens this week. More here:: FT: Greek bailout monitors hold emergency summit European commissioner Pierre Moscovici says he\u2019s hopeful of a breakthrough with Greece, but warned that more work is needed. Speaking on France Inter radio a few minutes ago, Moscovici said: \u201cThe discussions are fruitful, they are bearing fruit, there is real progress with a better understanding by both the Greek government and its creditors.\u201d \u201cIn the coming weeks we have to find a solution, I think we are doing it but efforts still need to be made on both sides.\u201d He added that he \u2018fervently\u2019 hopes that Greece remains in the eurozone. Last night\u2019s Berlin gathering may have been triggered by growing pressure from America to resolve the Greek crisis, says our Europe editor Ian Traynor. Washington officials fear that a Greek default could trigger the kind of chaos seen after Lehman Brothers failed in 2008, so president Obama could push for action when G7 leaders meet in Bavaria this weekend. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of Greece\u2019s bailout and other events across the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. The Greek crisis has stepped up another notch overnight after German chancellor Angela Merkel held an unscheduled emergency meeting in Berlin. As we covered in last night\u2019s liveblog, a planned meeting between Merkel, Francois Hollande and Jean-Claude Juncker turned into a top-level mini-summit with Christine Lagarde and Mario Draghi. On the table, whether creditors could find a way to break the deadlock with Greece and avert a default, and the risk of the country exiting the eurozone. The meeting lasted from 9.30pm local time until around midnight, as speculation swirled that creditors were planning to make a new offer to Greece. German media reported that Merkel was determined to find a \u201ccommon position\u201d on Greece. One official told Die Welt: \u201cThe endgame is beginning. The meeting is aimed at making the Greeks a final offer.\u201d After the meeting broke up, a German government spokesman gave little detail away, saying only that: \u201cThey agreed that work must continue with real intensity,\u201d \u201cThe participants in the talks were in close contact in recent days and want this to remain the case in the coming days both among themselves and of course with the Greek government.\u201d We may find out in the hours ahead whether the meeting actually yielded a breakthough, or not. Also coming up today We get new inflation data from across the eurozone at 10am BST. Economists predict that process started rising again in June, with the Consumer Prices Index tipped to rise by 0.2%. And we also get unemployment data from Germany and Spain this morning. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: A decline of 115k is expected in Spain which is likely to be most welcome given the current governments unpopularity, but it will still have to go some to make any sort of dent in the current 23% unemployment rate. German unemployment is set to stay at a record low of 6.4%. Last night, we learned that France\u2019s jobless rate had risen to a new history high.

That\u2019s not to be sniffed at. But, if you want to believe that AO is a revolutionary company, you have to think pan-European success will come quickly and confidently. In fact, it\u2019s far too early to tell: revenues in Germany, the first new market, were only \u00a35.8m in the first six months of trading there.</p> <p>German start-up losses and set-up costs, plus \u00a32.5m of incentive rewards for executives, meant AO recorded a pre-tax loss of \u00a32.9m for the year. The share price has descended from 285p at float to 170p, making the equity worth \u00a3715m, but that still looks a rich valuation. Flogging fridges and freezers will always be a low-margin activity and it will be at least two years before the success of the German adventure, and any others, can be assessed properly.

The mealy-mouthed, and inadequate, protestations of \u201cconcern\u201d in recent days from the likes of Visa, Coca-Cola, Adidas, McDonald\u2019s and Anheuser-Busch have been a depressing sub-plot to the allegations of bribery and corruption at Fifa.</p> <p>These corporate titans have been able for years to demand that world football\u2019s governing body undergoes root-and-branch reform under a new president. Even after the crisis erupted, they flunked it. They chose timid words over taking a stand. If a consumer backlash follows, the sponsors will get what they deserve.</p>",

Tuesday\u2019s figures met February\u2019s lowered expectations but Roberts\u2019 admission that the UK trading environment remains \u201cchallenging\u201d will do nothing to calm nerves. There is a suspicion that the problem isn\u2019t so much the retail climate, where disposable incomes are improving in the UK, but stiffer online competition from the likes of Dixons Carphone. AO could still boast a 22% rise in UK revenues to \u00a3471m and a 47% improvement in UK top-line profits to \u00a311.2m for the financial year. That\u2019s not to be sniffed at. But, if you want to believe that AO is a revolutionary company, you have to think pan-European success will come quickly and confidently. In fact, it\u2019s far too early to tell: revenues in Germany, the first new market, were only \u00a35.8m in the first six months of trading there. German start-up losses and set-up costs, plus \u00a32.5m of incentive rewards for executives, meant AO recorded a pre-tax loss of \u00a32.9m for the year. The share price has descended from 285p at float to 170p, making the equity worth \u00a3715m, but that still looks a rich valuation. Flogging fridges and freezers will always be a low-margin activity and it will be at least two years before the success of the German adventure, and any others, can be assessed properly. Too many questions, too few answers. Fifa sponsors bear some blame Sepp Blatter\u2019s resignation as the president of Fifa deprives the sponsors of their last opportunity to salvage a scrap of respectability by demanding that he goes. The mealy-mouthed, and inadequate, protestations of \u201cconcern\u201d in recent days from the likes of Visa, Coca-Cola, Adidas, McDonald\u2019s and Anheuser-Busch have been a depressing sub-plot to the allegations of bribery and corruption at Fifa. These corporate titans have been able for years to demand that world football\u2019s governing body undergoes root-and-branch reform under a new president. Even after the crisis erupted, they flunked it. They chose timid words over taking a stand. If a consumer backlash follows, the sponsors will get what they deserve.",

After a mini-summit in Berlin attended by the heads of the European commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the so-called troika is preparing a fresh bail out offer. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government was denying all knowledge of a new plan to break the deadlock, but one thing is certain: this Greek drama can end in only one of three ways. Option one is that Greece leaves the euro, by accident or design. Greece could decide that the troika\u2019s terms are too harsh. The troika could lose patience and throw Greece out. Euro exit could prove the least bad economic choice for Greece, which would devalue and write off a large chunk of its debt. Life would be tough, but the pain might be less prolonged than under seemingly endless externally-imposed austerity. A Grexit now would probably cause fewer economic shockwaves than it would have done two or three years ago, but there would still be knock-on effects on Europe and the wider global community. The political ramifications would be more serious. Greek departure would embolden anti-austerity parties across Europe, most notably Podemos in Spain. It would be the first setback to ever-closer European integration over six decades and would cast a shadow over David Cameron\u2019s renegotiation of Britain\u2019s EU membership . Option two is a Greek cave in. Tsipras has been trying to ride two horses at once : the desire of Greek voters to both end austerity and stay in the euro. The moment is rapidly arriving when Tsipras has to decide which of the two goals is the more important, because it looks as if he can\u2019t achieve both. But if Tsipras is going to capitulate, he is showing little sign of it. The late-night meeting in Berlinsuggests the troika is worried. Angela Merkel hosts a meeting of the G7 in Bavaria this weekend and does not want it to be overshadowed by Greece. All that points to option three, a good old-fashioned euro fudge. This would involve Greece\u2019s creditors watering down their austerity demands and providing the bridging finance that would allow Tsipras to meet the series of debt repayments due this summer. This would provide the breathing space for a referendum to be held on whether the Greeks believe yet more austerity is a price worth paying for staying in the euro, and for negotiations on the big long-term issue: the need for some of Greece\u2019s debt to be written off.

      "bodyText": "Shares in the online appliance retailer AO World have tumbled after the company revealed a pre-tax loss of \u00a32.9m. AO World fell sharply on Tuesday to close at 170p after it revealed worse-than-expected trading figures for its first year as a listed company. The company said the outlook in the UK remained challenging but insisted that it was well positioned to compete. AO World\u2019s share price has been battered since it entered the stock market in February 2014, valued at \u00a31.2bn, despite profits of less than \u00a38m \u2013 a gap that raised eyebrows in the City. The company was forced to issue a profits warning in February, when it admitted it may have been a victim of flotation hype. Since then the sell-off has continued, led by chairman Richard Rose, who offloaded 5.58m shares in March. He sold the shares for 180p, a hefty discount to AO\u2019s float price of 285p when it joined the stock market last year. AO World reported revenues of \u00a3477m for the year ending 31 March, up 24% on last year. Website sales for the UK rose 33% to \u00a3382m. But the firm was dragged into loss-making territory as it spent money on building a web presence in Germany. John Roberts, AO World\u2019s chief executive, said he was pleased with the firm\u2019s progress in Germany. \u201cOur long-term plan is on track and, despite missing our financial expectations for the year, we have continued to take market share in the UK MDA [major domestic appliances] market.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Eurozone inflation turned a corner in May, posting a 0.3% increase after four months of flat or fallingprices. The measure of core inflation, which strips out food, energy and other volatile elements of the consumer prices index, jumped even higher to 0.9%, signalling a resurgence in demand across the eurozone. The euro edged up 1% to push through $1.10 while sterling remained steady at 1.37 as the return of modest inflation combined with hopes for better news on Greece to bolster investor confidence. Inflation in the service sector rose by 1.3%, up from 1.0% in April, while food, alcohol &amp; tobacco prices rose by 1.2% (up from 1.0%). And the prices of non-energy industrial goods rose by 0.3%. Eurozone prices started falling in December, partly because of a sharp drop in global oil prices. The anaemic state of the eurozone recovery, which has lagged the UK and US in the last two years, has also played a major role in keeping a lid on inflation, with high unemployment and stagnant wages. However, over the past couple of months, oil prices have started edging higher. Energy prices in May were down by 5% year-on-year, having been 5.8% lower in April. The rebound in oil prices coincided with the European Central Bank\u2019s \u20ac1.1tn boost to lending across the eurozone, which began to take effect in April. Policymakers at the ECB are expected to feel vindicated as they gather in Frankfurt, Germany, for their latest policy meeting after heavy criticism of their decision to adopt quantitative easing. The move appears to have played a major role in improving household and business confidence to move the eurozone economy up a gear. However, they\u2019re unlikely to get carried away as the headline inflation rate is still way short of the target of just below 2%. Timo del Carpio, European economist at RBC Capital Markets, said: \u201cWhile today\u2019s outturn may provide further breathing room for the governing council by reducing the risk of a more pernicious deflationary environment taking root it is far from sufficient to precipitate a change of course.\u201d ECB president Mario Draghi may even increase his forecast for economic growth when the central bank\u2019s governing council reports on Wednesday.",

    "webTitle": "A more radical approach to debt: do nothing", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the most obvious legacies of the global financial crisis is the sharp increase in public debt. Countries scrambling to avert the collapse of their economies or banking systems built up stocks of debt at a pace previously unseen during peacetime. Attention has more recently turned to how quickly that debt should be paid down. In the UK, Chancellor George Osborne has made cutting the national debt as a share of GDP a key pledge. But now economists at the International Monetary Fund have explored the potential merits of a more radical approach to all this debt: doing nothing at all. In other words, \u201cjust live with it\u201d, they propose. Some countries, such as Greece, have no choice but to pay down debts because they are close to a debt limit at which markets may demand a huge risk premium or even deny them access, according to a staff discussion note written by Jonathan Ostry, Atish Ghosh and Raphael Espinoza from the IMF\u2019s research department. But the case for cutting is not so simple for other countries, those whose debts fall into what the authors call a \u201cgreen zone\u201d. \u201cWhile there are some countries where clearly debt needs to be brought down, there are others which are in a more comfortable position to fund themselves at exceptionally low interest rates, and which could indeed simply live with their debt (allowing their debt ratio to decline through growth or windfall revenues),\u201d Ostry and Ghosh write in a blogpost to accompany the discussion note. Sharp rise in debt ratios The context for such an argument is one where governments have taken on huge debt piles but have \u201clittle or no more public infrastructure to show for it\u201d. At the same time economic growth since the crisis has only been moderate. The IMF experts note that debt is bad for growth, thanks to the distortionary taxation needed to service public debt. \u201cBut it does not follow that paying down the debt is good for growth,\u201d they add. \u201cThis is a case where the cure may be worse than the disease: paying down the debt would require further distorting the economy, with a corresponding toll on investment and growth,\u201d says the discussion note, which the Fund points out does not necessarily represent IMF views or IMF policy. Lacklustre growth There is no one-size-fits-all policy when it comes to public debt, say the authors. Deciding whether a country is in the \u201cgreen zone\u201d is \u201cnot a mechanical exercise but will require judgments based on stress-testing fiscal balance sheets to withstand extreme shocks\u201d. But their final words provide plenty of food for thought for those finance ministers wedded to the idea of getting debt down. \u201cThe mantra that it is always desirable to reduce public debt must not go unquestioned. A comparison of costs and benefits must underpin policy advice. For countries in the green zone, the case for living with the debt is a strong one.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK Center Parcs holiday resorts business has been sold to a Canadian investment firm in a \u00a32.4bn deal. Brookfield Property Partners, a Toronto-based company listed on the New York stock exchange, announced it was buying the UK holiday village company from its private-equity owners, Blackstone. The sale price was not disclosed, although people close to the deal confirmed it was bought for more than \u00a32.4bn. Brookfield topped rival bids from CVC Capital Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Center Parcs is the second high-profile acquisition for Brookfield in the UK this year, following the \u00a32.6bn purchase of Canary Wharf financial district in collaboration with the Qatari Investment Authority. Brookfield will take ownership of five Center Parcs sites in the UK, each consisting of holiday homes set in 400 acres of woodland, with activities ranging from archery to spa treatments. The company said it expected 2m guests this year. Center Parcs Europe will remain a separate business. The first Center Parcs holiday village opened in a forest in the Dutch province of Limburg in 1967. The cottages \u2013 equipped with colour TV and central heating \u2013 were designed by the modernist architect Jaap Bakema, a leading member of the Team 10 architectural group, who was responsible for much of the redesign of postwar Rotterdam. The concept arrived in the UK in 1987 when Center Parcs opened in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire. Soon after opening a second park in Elveden Forest, Suffolk, in 1989, the Dutch owners sold the UK business to Scottish &amp; Newcastle brewers. The holiday company fell into the hands of private equity firm Blackstone in 2006. Under Blackstone\u2019s ownership, at least \u00a3100m was spent upgrading cottages, restaurants and facilities, helping lift occupancy rates to 97%. The private equity company has nearly quadrupled its original investment, but has not disclosed figures. Gerry Murphy, chairman of the Blackstone Group, said it had been an excellent investment. The deal is a departure for Brookfield in the UK, which has so far concentrated its British investments on office buildings and warehouses. However, Brookfield is not new to the leisure industry and already owns hotels in Australia and North America, including resorts in Las Vegas and the Bahamas. Ric Clark, chief executive officer of Brookfield Property Group, said the company saw \u201ccompelling opportunities to grow the business and enhance our investment returns\u201d at Center Parcs. The deal is expected to be completed in July.",

    "webTitle": "Morrisons could cling on to FTSE 100 place after sales boost", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Morrisons looks set to cling on to its place in the FTSE 100 after the supermarket delivered its first quarter of sales growth since December 2013 giving a boost for new boss David Potts. The UK\u2019s fourth biggest grocer looked set to be kicked out of the blue chip index as a result of its declining value, but the shares inched up nearly 2% after new sales data - meaning the retailer might now retain its position in the prestigious FTSE 100. The data was the latest market share figures published by analysis firm Kantar Worldpanel. It showed sales ahead just 0.1% in the 12 weeks to 24 May. But the increase marked out Morrisons as the only one of the UK \u201cbig four\u201d British supermarkets to register growth over the last three months. The news boosted the retailer\u2019s shares to 172.5p which on Tuesday night appeared to have lifted Morrisons\u2019 market value above mobile power company Aggreko, to maintain its place in the leading index rather than be demoted to the FTSE 250 mid-cap index. The likely index changes need to be ratified on Wednesday by the FTSE committee, which compiles the stock market indices. It is still possible that Morrisons could be demoted, if a very large trade which went through just after the market closed is taken into account by the committee. But the tiny increase in sales is a sliver of good news for Potts, who on Thursday faces his first annual shareholder meeting at Morrisons headquarters in Bradford. The former Tesco executive joined the company in March. The retailer is expected to receive criticism for paying out a \u00a31m bonus to its former chief executive Dalton Philips, who was ousted after months of falling sales and profits. Sir Ken Morrison, the group\u2019s former chairman and chief executive, who built his father\u2019s business into a national chain, is expected to attend. Last year he attacked Philips\u2019s strategy as \u201cbullshit\u201d. His views on Potts are not yet clear. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said Morrisons\u2019 sales were being lifted by a combination of online growth and the success of its Match &amp; More loyalty card - both initiatives begun under Philips. But he said some of Potts\u2019 initiatives, such as putting more staff into stores and bringing back staffed express check-outs, also appeared to be bearing fruit. \u201cA committed core of loyal Morrisons consumers is responding positively to recent initiatives and business has been boosted by online sales,\u201d said McKevitt. \u201cMorrisons\u2019 performance is an improvement on what was a difficult May 2014, so this is only the first step in any future recovery.\u201d Morrisons\u2019 rise in sales shows a marked improvement from a 1.1% fall in sales revealed last month by Kantar. In contrast, Asda continued to trail its rivals in the latest figures, with sales falling 2.4% . Sales declined 1.3% at Tesco and there was a 0.3% dip at Sainsbury\u2019s. All the major supermarkets are suffering as they struggle to bring their prices on basic goods closer to those of the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl. Both the German discounters are also seeing sales growth slow as they too have been forced to cut prices to maintain their price lead on the traditional supermarket chain. Lidl\u2019s sales growth slowed to 8.8% in the latest period \u2013 the first time it has dropped to single digits for two years. McKevitt said: \u201cLike everyone else, Lidl is cutting prices and that\u2019s taking money out of the till. If anything, discounters\u2019 prices are falling more quickly [than the major supermarkets] because of their focus on fresh produce and own-label. Brands are able to sustain prices better.\u201d He said the stores were also seeing growth slow as many of their established stores were now at full capacity - with full carparks and queues at the till.

      "body": "<p>Morrisons looks set to cling on to its place in the FTSE 100 after the supermarket delivered its first quarter of sales growth since December 2013 giving a boost for new boss David Potts.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s fourth biggest grocer looked set to be kicked out of the blue chip index as a result of its declining value, but the shares inched up nearly 2% after new sales data - meaning the retailer might now retain its position in the prestigious FTSE 100.</p> <p>The data was the latest market share figures published by analysis firm Kantar Worldpanel. It showed sales ahead just 0.1% in the 12 weeks to 24 May. But the increase marked out Morrisons as the only one of the UK \u201cbig four\u201d British supermarkets to register growth over the last three months.</p> <p>The news boosted the retailer\u2019s shares to 172.5p which on Tuesday night appeared to have lifted Morrisons\u2019 market value above mobile power company Aggreko, to maintain its place in the leading index rather than be demoted to the FTSE 250 mid-cap index.</p> <p>The likely index changes need to be ratified on Wednesday by the FTSE committee, which compiles the stock market indices. It is still possible that Morrisons could be demoted, if a very large trade which went through just after the market closed is taken into account by the committee.</p> <p>But the tiny increase in sales is a sliver of good news for Potts, who on Thursday faces his first annual shareholder meeting at Morrisons headquarters in Bradford. The former Tesco executive joined the company in March.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/31/morrisons-new-bosses-agm-sir-ken\">The retailer is expected to receive criticism for paying out a \u00a31m bonus to its former chief executive Dalton Philips</a>, who was ousted after months of falling sales and profits. Sir Ken Morrison, the group\u2019s former chairman and chief executive, who built his father\u2019s business into a national chain, is expected to attend. Last year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/05/morrisons-former-chairman-accuses-management-ruining-supermarket-philips-gibson\">he attacked Philips\u2019s strategy as \u201cbullshit\u201d</a>. His views on Potts are not yet clear.</p> <p>Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said Morrisons\u2019 sales were being lifted by a combination of online growth and the success of its Match &amp; More loyalty card - both initiatives begun under Philips.</p> <p>But he said some of Potts\u2019 initiatives, such as putting more staff into stores and bringing back staffed express check-outs, also appeared to be bearing fruit. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10da86abf07be1c4f539420e464c2a9298e33d36\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433240022690/d5d08daa-6522-4149-9f3e-b837f4731d43-460x364.jpeg\" alt=\"Kantar Worldpanel\" width=\"460\" height=\"364\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kantar Worldpanel table on market share.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kantar Worldpanel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA committed core of loyal Morrisons consumers is responding positively to recent initiatives and business has been boosted by online sales,\u201d said McKevitt. \u201cMorrisons\u2019 performance is an improvement on what was a difficult May 2014, so this is only the first step in any future recovery.\u201d<br></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Morrisons\u2019 rise in sales shows a marked improvement from a 1.1% fall in sales revealed last month by Kantar. In contrast, Asda continued to trail its rivals in the latest figures, with sales falling 2.4% . Sales declined 1.3% at Tesco and there was a 0.3% dip at Sainsbury\u2019s.</p> <p>All the major supermarkets are suffering as they struggle to bring their prices on basic goods closer to those of the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>Both the German discounters are also seeing sales growth slow as they too have been forced to cut prices to maintain their price lead on the traditional supermarket chain.</p> <p>Lidl\u2019s sales growth slowed to 8.8% in the latest period \u2013 the first time it has dropped to single digits for two years. </p> <p>McKevitt said: \u201cLike everyone else, Lidl is cutting prices and that\u2019s taking money out of the till. If anything, discounters\u2019 prices are falling more quickly [than the major supermarkets] because of their focus on fresh produce and own-label. Brands are able to sustain prices better.\u201d</p> <p>He said the stores were also seeing growth slow as many of their established stores were now at full capacity - with full carparks and queues at the till.</p> <p>Aldi\u2019s sales were up 15.7% in the three months \u2013 taking it to a new market share high of 5.4%.

      "bodyText": "Three tobacco companies are appealing against a \u201chistoric\u201d decision by a Canadian court to award smokers C$15.6bn (\u00a38.2bn) in damages. Quebec superior court justice Brian Riordan said the companies had put profits before the health of their customers, as he issued his long-awaited decision in what is thought to be Canada\u2019s largest class-action lawsuit. Bruce Johnston, a lawyer with one of the firms that took on the tobacco companies, called the ruling \u201chistoric \u2013 not just for the compensation for victims but also for public health and accountability\u201d. More than a million smokers and former smokers in Quebec were seeking damages, on the grounds that the companies knew they were selling a harmful product but concealed the risks. The case covered two groups of plaintiffs: those who became seriously ill from smoking and those who said they could not quit. Riordan found for the plaintiffs in a scathing judgment against three tobacco companies \u2013 Imperial Tobacco Canada, a subsidiary of British American Tobacco; Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges, a subsidiary of Philip Morris; and JTI Macdonald Ltd, part of Japan Tobacco. \u201cThe companies earned billions of dollars at the expense of the lungs, the throats and the general well-being of their customers,\u201d he wrote in a 276-page judgment. \u201cIf the companies are allowed to walk away unscathed now, what would be the message to other industries that today or tomorrow find themselves in a similar moral conflict?\u201d One of the lawsuits was brought by Jean-Yves Blais, who died of lung cancer in 2012 aged 68. At a press conference in Montreal, his widow urged people to quit smoking. \u201cYour health is completely lost,\u201d said Lise Blaise, carrying photos of her late husband. \u201cI waited every year [for a judgment] \u2014 for 17 years. But I had the opinion we were going to win and we did.\u201d Although the cases were launched in 1998, the trial did not begin until March 2012. Proceedings concluded in December 2012 after the court heard from 76 witnesses and reviewed more than 43,000 documents. One lawyer for the plaintiffs, Andre Lesperance, described the ruling as a great victory for the plaintiffs and society. \u201cThese three companies lied to their customers for 50 years and hurt their right to life,\u201d he said. The three firms must now split the damages according to the responsibility assigned by the court: Imperial Tobacco Canada has been ordered to pay two-thirds of the total, C$10.5bn, while RBH has been allocated a 20% share (C$3.1bn) and JTI Macdonald Corp must pay 13% (C$2bn). All three tobacco firms said they planned to contest the decision. Imperial Tobacco Canada said the judgment \u201cignores the reality that both adult consumers and governments have known about the risks associated with smoking for decades\u201d. Its parent company, British American Tobacco, one of the UK\u2019s biggest enterprises, was the biggest faller on the London stock exchange on Tuesday, losing 1.5% of its value. In a statement to investors, BAT said no payments would be made until a request to stay the execution order has been heard. \u201cThere are strong legal grounds with which to challenge both the overall judgment and to seek a stay of the provisional execution order, which Imperial Tobacco Canada will do within 30 days of the original 27 May ruling,\u201d it said. An RBH spokeswoman said the cases were far from over. \u201cWe will vigorously appeal this lower court\u2019s judgment, and believe that we have very strong legal grounds to overturn the judgment in its entirety.\u201d JTI-Macdonald said that Canadians have been well aware of the health risks since the 1950s and health warnings have been on packages for more than 40 years. \u201cJTI-Macdonald Corp fundamentally disagrees with today\u2019s judgment and intends to file an appeal,\u201d it said. \u201cThe company strongly believes that the evidence presented at trial does not justify the court\u2019s conclusions.\u201d The plaintiffs said the companies were required to pay $C1bn within 60 days regardless of any appeal.",

    "webTitle": "Australian MPs allowed to see top-secret trade deal text but can't reveal contents for four years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Australian politicians have been told they can view the current confidential negotiating text for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, but only if they agree not to divulge anything they see for four years, despite expectations the deal could be finalised within months. As 10 years of highly secret negotiations over the 12-nation trade and investment pact draw to a close and the US Congress debates whether to grant president Barack Obama fast-track authority, MPs and senators were briefed on the deal Monday night by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade assistant secretary Elizabeth Ward and other officials. The MPs were told that, despite the negotiations being \u201cin the final stages\u201d and \u201cat the end game\u201d, key provisions had not been agreed \u2013 including intellectual property clauses of deep concern to the Australian government and controversial legal avenues for corporations to take action against governments \u2013 so-called investor state dispute settlements (ISDS). They were also told the ISDS process itself was still being negotiated, including provisions on transparency. They were told they could view the current TPP negotiating text on Tuesday \u201csubject to certain confidentiality requirements\u201d and were shown a document they would be required to sign before any viewing. The document listed requirements which it said were \u201cconsistent with the undertaking by Australia and other negotiating partners to treat negotiating texts and other documents exchanged in the course of negotiations as confidential government information in order to facilitate candid and productive negotiations\u201d. The requirements listed were as follows: \u201cI will not divulge any of the text or information obtained in the briefing to any party, I will not copy, transcribe or remove the negotiating text\u201d and \u201cI further acknowledge that the negotiating text is confidential and sensitive; disclosure of the negotiating text may affect adversely TPP negotiations and Australia\u2019s relations with other TPP partners.\u201d It concluded: \u201cI therefore agree that these confidentiality requirements shall apply for four years after entry into force of the TPP, or if no agreement enters into force, for four years after the last round of negotiations.\u201d Among those attending the briefing were Coalition backbenchers Bruce Scott and George Christensen, Labor backbenchers Stephen Jones, Andrew Giles, Melissa Parke and Terri Butler and independent senator Nick Xenophon. The four-year confidentiality provision mirrors the secrecy provisions printed on the investment chapter of the TPP, which was published by Wikileaks in March. That document said it could be declassified \u201cfour years from entry into force of the TPP agreement or, if no agreement enters into force, four years from the close of the negotiations\u201d and said it \u201cmust be protected from unauthorized disclosure ... and must be stored in a locked or secured building, room, or container\u201d. When Christensen queried the four-year timeframe at the meeting he was told it was needed because the final version of the document might be different from the current version, and that it was similar to the undertakings required of members of the US Congress who wanted to view the text. Among the most controversial provisions of the TPP is the proposed investor state dispute settlement mechanism, which could allow multinational corporations to challenge Australian government policies in international arbitration tribunals, for example plain-packaging laws or environmental or health regulations. The former Labor government put a footnote into the TPP investment text saying Australia did not agree to ISDS provisions. The current government has \u2013 according to the leaked Wikileaks version \u2013 added that it is prepared to agree to ISDS if \u201ccertain conditions\u201d are met. Australia wants exemptions from intellectual property provisions for \u201cany measures comprising or related to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Medicare Benefits Scheme, the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator\u201d. The government is particularly concerned to make sure the agreement does not require Australia to extend the period that drugs remain on patent, because of the huge potential impact on the cost of Australia\u2019s pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Parke said she still had \u201cextremely grave concerns about the ISDS provisions. I note that the briefing confirmed that the Philip Morris scenario could still happen under this agreement\u201d. The tobacco giant is using ISDS provisions in Australia\u2019s free-trade agreement with Hong Kong to challenge plain-packaging laws that have been upheld by Australia\u2019s high court. Xenophon said he was also concerned about ISDS, saying \u201c40 years ago Gough Whitlam abolished appeals to the [British] privy council in what was a watershed moment for Australian sovereignty. We now seem to be going back to the colonial era where court cases, not just appeals, will be determined overseas\u201d. Butler said she also \u201cremained concerned about the ISDS provisions ... I will need a lot more information to be satisfied this is in the national interest, compared with the status quo, which is the bilateral trade agreements we already have with most of these countries\u201d. After the Wikileaks revelations, the trade minister, Andrew Robb, insisted \u201cthe government will not support outcomes that would increase the prices of medicines for Australians or adversely affect our health system more generally; end of story ... Nor would we accept outcomes that undermine our ability to regulate or legislate in the public interest in areas such as health\u201d. In recent interviews and opinion pieces, Robb has said the deal could provide huge benefits for Australian exporters \u2013 including agricultural exports \u2013 and says ISDS provisions have been included in many bilateral agreements Australia has already signed. The only time they have been used against Australia is the ongoing case being brought by Philip Morris but Australian companies have successfully used the clauses against companies in India. He says the government has conducted more than 1000 consultations with different groups about the TPP talks. \u201cIt\u2019s not secretive but of course the whole text is not available because nothing\u2019s agreed until everything\u2019s agreed, so to be putting out bits and pieces over five years, which may or may not end up in the final document, all that\u2019s going to do is be a source of material for those anti-trade groups to worry people and misrepresent, he told the ABC. The TPP is being negotiated with the US, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. The cabinet will decide whether Australia signs any final agreement, and then text will be tabled in parliament and be considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties before implementing legislation is considered by the House of Representatives and the Senate.",

      "bodyText": "Cuisine from Europe\u2019s warmer climes is back on top of the annual list of the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants, which this year sees El Celler de Can Roca of Girona, Spain, reclaim the title it last held in 2013. Victory was achieved at the expense of Noma, a four-time Danish winner known for its clinical servings of deep-fried moss and pine foam, which was bumped down to third to make way for an Italian runner-up, Modena\u2019s Osteria Francescana. But while the list will be toasted in Spain and Italy, the complete absence of any restaurants from France in its top 10 is likely to ensure that Gallic knives remain out after a number of top French chefs including Jo\u00ebl Robuchon and Georges Blanc signed an online petition criticising the 50 Best on a number of grounds. Britain retained toe-holds in the rankings, announced on Monday at London\u2019s Guildhall, although Dinner by Heston Blumenthal fell two spots to seventh place and Brett Graham\u2019s The Ledbury in west London was down 10 positions to 20th. Renowned for its free-style cooking and cutting edge techniques, this year\u2019s overall winner held the title two years ago before slipping to second place last year. El Celler de Can Roca was opened in 1986 by Brothers Joan and Josep Roca. The 50 Best organisation said: \u201cCrucially, this is a restaurant that has never forgotten its humble roots, its sense of familial warmth, or the need to serve remarkably delicious dishes and outstanding wines.\u201d William Reed Media, publishers of the Restaurant magazine and organisers of the yearly list, say that it is created from the votes of an \u201cinfluential group of almost 1,000 international leaders in the restaurant community\u201d. For the first time, consultants Deloitte were also said to have been brought into the mix as an \u201cofficial independent adjudication partner\u201d in order to \u201censure that the integrity and authenticity of the voting process\u201d. The deployment of Deloitte has come against the backdrop of reported comments by Arnaud Tillon, the brand director for Nestl\u00e9 Waters, which owns list sponsor San Pellegrino, who was said to have suggested that a lack of transparency in the list\u2019s methodology was a problem for the company in France. Separately, the list has come under attack from Occupy 50 Best, an online campaign describing itself as \u201cWe, the culinary connoisseurs of all countries and creeds: cooks, critics or simply lovers of Good Food.\u201d It has been behind a petition urging sponsors to stop supporting an \u201copaque, obsequious ranking, where nationalism trumps quality, sexism trumps diversity and the spotlight is on the celebrity chef instead of the health and satisfaction of the customer\u201d. In terms of the international share, France has five restaurants in this year\u2019s 50 Best, which includes seven from the US and nine from Latin America.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, moved to try to defuse Greece\u2019s financial and European crisis late on Monday, converting a routine long-scheduled meeting with French and EU leaders into a mini-summit on Greece. Merkel met France\u2019s president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, for what was billed as a session on how to boost investment in the EU. But they were joined by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, in what turned into a late-night session on Greece. Athens is facing insolvency and payments of \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.1bn) to the IMF within the next few weeks, with the first payment of \u20ac300m due by Friday. Now it appears that the Greek drama is shifting up a gear, heading for its denouement, after five months of negotiations between Greece and its eurozone/IMF creditors going nowhere. Merkel\u2019s staff let it be known that the chancellor wanted the mini-summit in Berlin to deliver a \u201cfinal offer\u201d to Athens, German public television reported. \u201cThe creditors want to agree a common position tonight,\u201d ZDF television said. Merkel wanted the deal sealed before a meeting this weekend in Germany of the G7 countries. Whether the terms of the proposed resolution represented an ultimatum to Greece was unclear. The meeting began in Berlin at 9.30pm local time and lasted until around midnight. Die Welt newspaper quoted German government officials as saying: \u201cThe endgame is beginning. The meeting is aimed at making the Greeks a final offer.\u201d However, after the end of talks a German spokesman said the leaders had agreed \u201cthat work must continue with real intensity\u201d. He added: \u201cThe participants in the talks were in close contact in recent days and want this to remain the case in the coming days both among themselves and of course with the Greek government.\u201d Both sides remain far apart on key sticking points of the bailout terms, with the eurozone and the IMF insisting on liberalising pledges on labour markets, collective wage bargaining, pension systems and privatisation from the Greeks in return for releasing a final \u20ac7.2bn in bailout funds that would tide Greece over for most of the summer. It would then pave the way for further negotiations on a third rescue package for Greece, which might involve a writedown of the country\u2019s unsustainable debt. While it remained unclear what, if anything, the Berlin session would offer Greece, the very fact of its taking place represented a victory of sorts for Alexis Tsipras, the leftwing Greek prime minister elected in January with a mandate to overthrow five years of eurozone \u2013 and German-dictated \u2013 austerity. In a lengthy broadside published at the weekend in Le Monde, Tsipras denounced the eurozone for making \u201cabsurd\u201d demands on Greece, predicted that the creditor governments\u2019 demands of Athens would lead to the break up of the EU, would destroy democracy in Europe and render elections in countries being bailed out pointless. The tirade by Tsipras came despite daily pronouncements from Athens that Greece and the eurozone were on the brink of a settlement. But Tsipras insisted that the crisis had moved beyond the level of financial and technocratic negotiations and would need to be resolved at the level of EU political leaders. Monday night\u2019s session of eurozone and IMF leaders appeared to vindicate that position. The Greek prime minister\u2019s bold move at the weekend appeared to be aimed at forcing Merkel to make up her mind over whether or not she was prepared to see Greece crash out of the single currency zone. Both sides appeared to be locked in an escalating exercise in brinkmanship that would need to be resolved one way or another by national leaders.",
