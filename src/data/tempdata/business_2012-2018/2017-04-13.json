      "bodyText": "Labour has pledged to tackle what it calls an epidemic of high street bank closures by only permitting branches to be shut after a local consultation and with the permission of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Under a policy to be outlined by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the party would replace the current guidance system over closures, called the access to banking protocol, which was agreed between high street banks, consumer groups and the government. Labour cited Consumers\u2019 Association figures saying 1,046 bank branches around the UK closed between December 2015 and January 2017, with 486 more scheduled for closure this year. \u201cHigh street bank closures have become an epidemic in the last few years, blighting our town centres, hurting particularly elderly and more vulnerable customers, and local small businesses whilst making healthy profits for themselves,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s time our banks recognise instead that they are a utility providing an essential public service.\u201d Labour argues that the big four banks \u2013 Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC and NatWest/RBS \u2013 made more than \u00a311bn in combined profit from high street banking during 2015, meaning there was no pressing cost reason for the branch closures. It says its pledge is aimed at assisting small businesses and older customers, who tend to be less likely to use internet or phone banking. The party cited a Social Market Foundation report, which found that 11% of the population carry out their banking only using their local branch, with these tending to be older or poorer customers. The proposal would extend the duties of the FCA and give it power to approve any branch closures. This could only happen after banks consulted customers and the local council and published details of the reasons, including the revenues and costs of the branch in question. The consultation would be overseen by the FCA, which would then \u201censure that the closure of the branch does not degrade the local financial infrastructure\u201d or harm the community in other ways. Responding to the announcement, the Conservative vice-chair and MP for Pudsey, Stuart Andrew, did not specifically comment on the plan, but criticised Labour\u2019s wider policies. \u201cLabour\u2019s plan for our high streets would see corporation tax going back up to 28% and \u00a3500bn of extra debt \u2013 all under a Labour leader who said that we should not be afraid of debt or borrowing,\u201d he said. \u201cOur support for high streets has seen town centre vacancy rates come back down since Labour were in government. Our support for small businesses has seen startup loans to help people launch new businesses, which has already helped 40,000 smaller firms across the country.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Your editorial on the French elections (11 April), with its encouraging mention of the rise of the higher tax and spend candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, failed to mention possibly his biggest electoral draw: the fact that he is a leftwing protectionist. Prior to the 2012 election, polls showed that over 80% of French across the political spectrum thought that free trade had a negative impact on employment. So it\u2019s not just immigration that is fuelling ever-broadening support for Marine Le Pen, it is also the fact that she too is an overt protectionist. These trends have obviously not been lost on the unholy trinity of free trade pushers the IMF, WTO, and the World Bank (Report, 11 April). Having forced nations across the world to accept their open-borders, export-led growth mantra they are now busy crying crocodile tears for the \u201cleft behind\u201d, the inevitable result of their policies. They still rail against protectionism, despite the fact that if it has a progressive end goal, it could enhance the economic and social conditions of the globally disadvantaged. In terms of the relevance of all this to the UK, and at the risk of intruding on public grief, what are the Labour party\u2019s views on these under-publicised protectionist trends? The likes of Trump and Le Pen have been able to turn it into a politically potent and successful issue, so why are so many progressives over here absent from this pivotal debate? Colin Hines East Twickenham, Middlesex \u2022 The attempt by the World Bank, IMF and WTO to defend the role of \u201cfree\u201d trade merely serves to underline their role as advocates of a neoliberal order that impoverishes the many and benefits the few. The call for a \u201crobust global trading system based on the WTO\u201d is aimed at locking in countries to a system that removes decision-making from sovereign states and places it instead in the boardrooms of transnational corporations. When their report states that trade is good for growth, what they really mean is that it is good for corporate balance sheets. And when they refer to helping those \u201cleft behind\u201d, they are inviting us to believe in discredited theories of trickle-down economics which holds that what is good for the rich is good for the poor. As we move into the uncertainties of a new post-Brexit trading regime, it is incumbent upon us to develop alternative models to outdated concepts that automatically equate GDP growth with increased wellbeing. And it\u2019s also time to not only challenge the WTO\u2019s direction of travel but also to recognise it for what it is and campaign for its abolition, replacing it instead with a consensual model of economic integration based on the needs and aspirations of independent states and their regional priorities. As Donald Trump preaches protectionism, he would do well to heed his far wiser predecessor, Thomas Jefferson, when he said: \u201cPeace commerce and honest friendship with all nations \u2026 entangling alliances with none.\u201d Bert Schouwenburg International officer, GMB \u2022 We must not lose sight of the downsides to globalisation and world trade. The rampant consumerism which is driving economic growth is certainly lifting incomes for some while also lining the pockets of global corporations. But only recently (Pollutionwatch, 10 April) you reported that our consumption of Chinese products causes about 55,000 early deaths from air pollution across China every year. While the three organisations say that they want to pay attention to disadvantaged individuals and communities, they will not be able to \u201clift up those who have been left behind\u201d if they are dead. Fiona Carnie Bath \u2022 \u201cWe worked together to ensure that the great recession did not become another great depression\u201d, says Christine Lagarde of the IMF. The truth is quite the opposite \u2013 they and their supporters in the US, the World Bank and the WTO, brought about the crash in 2008 with their insistence on deregulation of the finance business. The aftermath of 2008 is still penalising the poor and what used to be the better-off, both in the rich and poor worlds. Michael McLoughlin Wallington, Surrey \u2022 Doughnut economics is very compelling, but George Monbiot (Opinion, 12 April) and, presumably, Kate Raworth, seem not to have encountered A Blueprint for Survival. This remarkable document was published by the Club of Rome, with spadework by MIT, in 1969. It postulated that pollution would end matters if the world proceeded on its continual pursuit of economic growth. That hasn\u2019t happened, but not for our want of trying. But the important message was how to create a no-growth, vibrant successful economy by pouring all the world\u2019s efforts into recycling, making things that lasted as long as possible and general encouragement of invention centred on conservation of resources and environment. I and my colleagues teaching general studies in FE spent some enlightening weeks with our students exploring the validity of the proposals. I also wrote to my MP asking what the government\u2019s attitude was; I got a nondescript reply. And that\u2019s where matters shuddered to a permanent halt.

      "bodyText": "US markets are down in early trading as Trump\u2019s comments continue to reverberate around Wall Street. Here\u2019s how it looked at the opening bell: Dow Jones: -0.2% at 20,542 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,339 Nasdaq: -0.1% at 5,828 On that note, we\u2019ll close up for the day. Thank you for commenting and please join us again next week. Happy Easter. AM European markets are still in the red this afternoon: FTSE 100: -0.6% at 7,309 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.3% at 12,116 France\u2019s CAC: -0.6% at 5,072 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1% at 19,804 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.7% at 10,289 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.4% at 380 Over in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has used his last cabinet meeting before Easter to call for a \u201cbig political counter attack\u201d from ministers who will soon be called to defend concessions made by his leftist-led government with creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. Slamming the International Monetary Fund for the delays that have stalled bailout negotiations for close to a year, Tsipras said extra pension cuts and tax rises demanded by creditors once Athens\u2019 current bailout expires next year would be legislated in the next 15 days. Discussions on medium term debt relief \u2013 viewed by many as essential for the recession-ravaged Greek economy to finally rebound - would take place at the IMF\u2019s spring meeting next week, giving Athens a sense of what might be in store. The Greek prime minister, who says implementation of reforms depends on debt relief, also predicted an emergency summit of eurozone finance ministers in early May, once technical teams had completed a review in Athens where a deal would be finalised. If that happened, the country could be given access to the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme which would help Greece return to bond markets. The squeeze on real incomes in the UK shouldn\u2019t be too severe according to analysts at Capital Economics. It follows official figures on Wednesday which showed inflation outpaced regular pay growth (excluding bonuses) for the first time in two-and-a-half years in February. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, says: After two-and-a-half years of rising real wages, this week\u2019s inflation and labour market figures confirmed that the pay squeeze has returned. And, with inflation rising faster than expected, some further drop in real earnings looks likely over the coming months. However, the squeeze shouldn\u2019t be as sharp or prolonged as that seen after the financial crisis, and there are other reasons to think that spending growth might hold up rather better this time around. For a start, the labour market still appears to be tightening and we remain optimistic that this should result in at least some pick-up in nominal wage growth this year. And we think inflation should peak towards the end of this year, while nominal wage growth continues to accelerate slowly, paving the way for a faster increase in real earnings next year. Brent crude is up 0.2% at $55.97 a barrel after the International Energy Agency said global demand for oil is close to outstripping supply after nearly three years of surplus production. Oil stocks across the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development fell by 17.2m barrels in March, the IEA said. Paresh Davdra, chief executive and co-founder of RationalFX, says the pound is increasingly at the mercy of developments in other markets: Whilst the pound was once driven by political sentiment over Brexit before Article 50, it now seems more overtly driven by the fortunes of its major peers, achieving strong runs on the back of weakness in the dollar and the euro. This could make for volatile or inconsistent movement for the currency should the dollar or euro prove vulnerable to political drivers which, thus far, appears highly likely. Although being driven by risks in other markets has its benefits, investors will be hoping that the pound is able to gain independently of other currencies in the long term, particularly as the Brexit process progresses. The pound is just about holding on to gains against the dollar - currently at $1.2540 - in what has been a decent week for sterling: It\u2019s all relative though. On 23 June, the day of the EU referendum and before the Brexit vote was known, one pound would buy about $1.49: Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, says the Bank of England will be pleased by signs that lenders are making it tougher for consumers to borrow. If the fundamentals for consumers do weaken further as expected over the coming months, it is vital that banks adopt tight lending standards in granting unsecured consumer credit, or it risks causing serious debt problems for the economy. The Bank of England has clearly become more worried about consumer borrowing and debt levels in recent months. This was highlighted by the households savings ratio falling to a record low of 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Governor Mark Carney has also indicated that the Bank of England will closely monitor consumer dynamics over the coming months and it will be a major factor in their monetary policy decisions. More British lenders plan to tighten the supply of credit to consumers than at any time since the 2008/09 financial crisis. That\u2019s according to the latest quarterly credit conditions survey from the Bank of England, which found that a net balance of 18.8% of lenders expect to rein in supply over the next three months, up from 7.9% in the previous survey. It was the highest proportion since the end of 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed tipping the global economy into crisis. Britain\u2019s economic growth since the financial crisis has been fuelled by consumer spending, and the Bank had already flagged concerns that households will take on more debt to sustain spending as inflation rises and wage growth slows. The survey on Thursday also showed weaker business investment acted as a \u201csignificant drag\u201d on demand for credit among UK businesses. Unite, the UK\u2019s largest union, says it is concerned by Royal Mail\u2019s pension closure and will be studying the implications. Brian Scott, Unite officer for the Royal Mail: This is a cause for serious concern for a hardworking and dedicated workforce. We will study the implications of today\u2019s announcement very carefully and consider all the options going forward. If we don\u2019t achieve a satisfactory outcome, we can\u2019t rule out an industrial action ballot on this issue. We will be consulting our members closely on the next steps in the coming days and weeks.\u201d Royal Mail has responded to the threat of strike action by the Communication Workers Union, which has condemned the company\u2019s decision to close its defined benefit pension scheme. A spokesperson for Royal Mail said: Customers choose Royal Mail because they trust us to deliver. Any industrial action \u2013 or threat of it \u2013 undermines this trust between Royal Mail and our customers, and we could lose business as a result. The CWU said workers on average face losing up to a third of their future pensions. For a 50 year-old worker earning \u00a325,000 a year and retiring at 65, it would equate to a loss of \u00a34,392 a year (\u00a3109,800 over 25 years), the union calculated. Royal Mail responded: Under our proposal, only a very small percentage would see this level of reduction in their pension. If members leave Royal Mail employment before that age, the impact on their benefits would be smaller. The plan has around 90,000 members. The impact of the proposed changes will vary from member to member. For plan members close to retirement, we expect the changes to have a smaller effect. The impact of the proposed changes will depend on age, length of service and which part of the scheme a member is in. We know how important pension benefits are to our colleagues. We continue to work closely with our unions on a sustainable and affordable solution for the provision of future pension benefits. We will write to plan members once further decisions have been made. Investors appear to have welcomed the news that Royal Mail plans to close its defined benefit pensions scheme. Shares are up 0.8% at 422.5p, making it one of the FTSE\u2019s top risers. (The FTSE is down 0.5% at 7,311.). Shares in Royal Mail were up almost 2% earlier. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, gives his take on the plans: Shares in Royal Mail were up 1.9% this morning after the group finally announced it will be shutting its existing pension plan. Despite the scheme currently running a surplus, an impending review of company contributions has been hanging over the group for some time. Royal Mail\u2019s current contributions to this scheme alone are about 10% of total salary costs, including wages of staff who are not members of the scheme. These were expected to more than double to over \u00a31bn in 2018, equivalent to around 25% of the group\u2019s entire 2015/16 UK wage bill. However, with a highly unionised workforce, which has in the past shown itself willing to flex its muscle in defence members\u2019 rights, introducing an alternative plan is likely to prove costly. Whether those costs will be in the form of chunky employer contributions to a new defined contribution scheme or lost revenue from industrial action remains to be seen. The Communication Workers Union is threatening strike action over Royal Mail\u2019s decision to close its defined benefit pension scheme in 2018. The union said it \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d the move, which it says would cost the average worker a third of their future pension. Ray Ellis, acting deputy general secretary for postal workers at the CWU said the views of workers had been ignored: Although Royal Mail\u2019s own consultation exercise revealed massive opposition to its closure plan, the company has decided to ignore the views of its workforce and proceed with closure without consent. CWU has made clear that any attempt by the company to impose change without agreement will be met with the strongest possible opposition including a ballot for industrial action. We will not stand by and watch the company abandon the pension promises it made at the time of privatisation which threatens our members with massive cuts to their future pension benefits and insecurity and poverty in retirement. The CWU represents about 195,000 members in post, telecoms, mobile and financial services companies including Royal Mail, Post Office, BT, EE, O2 and Santander. Corporate news is a little thin on the ground this morning but Royal Mail has confirmed the closure of its defined benefit pension scheme. Julia Kollewe reports: Royal Mail has announced that it will close its 90,000 member pension fund after consulting members and unions, even though the scheme in surplus. It argues that the surplus would run out next year and the scheme would become unaffordable. The company, which was privatised in 2013, currently pays \u00a3400m a year into the fund but it says this could more than double to over \u00a31bn in 2018. The \u00a37.4bn defined-benefit scheme guarantees a pension based on a postal worker\u2019s average salary, and it is thought that Royal Mail will replace it with a less generous defined contribution scheme. The company said: We have concluded that there is no affordable solution to keeping the plan open in its current form. Therefore, the company has come to the decision that the plan will close to future accrual on 31 March 2018, subject to trustee approval. We know how important pension benefits are to our colleagues. We continue to work closely with our unions on a sustainable and affordable solution for the provision of future pension benefits. Major European markets have followed Wall Street and Asia lower this morning. The scores so far: FTSE 100: -0.5% at 7,315 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.2% at 12,130 France\u2019s CAC: -0.5% at 5,075 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 19,899 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.4% at 10,321 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.4% at 380 The weaker dollar is contributing to the fall in equities, as Spreadex\u2019s Connor Campbell explains: The pound obviously relished Trump\u2019s comments, climbing another half a percent in what has already been a very strong week for the currency. This in turn dragged the FTSE lower, the UK index dropping 45 points with the majority of its commodity and banking stocks also in the red. The eurozone indices suffered the same fate, the DAX and CAC falling by 0.5% and 0.6% respectively. That\u2019s because the euro was an even bigger beneficiary of the dollar-situation, rising 0.6% against the US currency to hit a one week peak. Regardless of whether this selloff has been overdone or not, there is little on the economic calendar to displace it from the forefront of investors\u2019 minds, meaning the dollar may struggle to regain its footing until this afternoon\u2019s US session at the very earliest. Elsa Lignos, global head of currency strategy for RBC Capital Markets, says the reaction in the FX markets to Trump\u2019s comments could well be short-lived. Typically, politicians\u2019 currency comments have no lasting effect\u2014the kneejerk reaction may be 50\u2013100pts but it quickly fades. The comments would have more lasting power if they drive Trump to openly look for a dove to replace Yellen, though her term is not up until October 2018. Trump softened his tone on China during the interview with the Wall Street Journal. Having previously branded Beijing the \u201cgrand champion\u201d of currency manipulation, the President said he\u2019d changed his mind: They\u2019re not currency manipulators. The President also refused to rule out a second term for the Fed chair Janet Yellen, despite saying on the campaign trail that she would not be reappointed. He said it was still \u201cvery early\u201d and that she was \u201cnot toast\u201d. I like her, I respect her. It\u2019s very early. Kathy Lien, managing director of currency strategy at BK Asset Management in New York said the dollar sell-off following Trump\u2019s comments was probably an overreaction: The market had a big reaction, but I think it was an overreaction. He may just be hedging his bets by making sure that the American public realises he\u2019s not backing down on trade. The pound is up against both the dollar and the euro this morning. Sterling is up 0.1% against the dollar at $1.2548, and 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1778. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is back above $1.25 following a warning from President Trump that the dollar \u201cis getting too strong\u201d because people have confidence in him. He told the Wall Street Journal: I think our dollar is getting too strong, and partially that\u2019s my fault because people have confidence in me. But that\u2019s hurting -- that will hurt ultimately. Look, there\u2019s some very good things about a strong dollar, but usually speaking the best thing about it is that it sounds good. It\u2019s very, very hard to compete when you have a strong dollar and other countries are devaluing their currency. The President also suggested he would like the Federal Reserve to keep US interest rates low: I do like a low-interest rate policy, I must be honest with you. The comments sent the dollar index - which tracks the US dollar against six major currencies - to its lowest level since 30 March.",

For a 50 year-old worker earning \u00a325,000 a year and retiring at 65, it would equate to a loss of \u00a34,392 a year (\u00a3109,800 over 25 years), the union calculated.</p> <p>Royal Mail responded:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Under our proposal, only a very small percentage would see this level of reduction in their pension. If members leave Royal Mail employment before that age, the impact on their benefits would be smaller. </p> <p>The plan has around 90,000 members. The impact of the proposed changes will vary from member to member. For plan members close to retirement, we expect the changes to have a smaller effect. The impact of the proposed changes will depend on age, length of service and which part of the scheme a member is in.</p> <p>We know how important pension benefits are to our colleagues.

Despite the scheme currently running a surplus, an impending review of company contributions has been hanging over the group for some time. </p> <p>Royal Mail\u2019s current contributions to this scheme alone are about 10% of total salary costs, including wages of staff who are not members of the scheme. These were expected to more than double to over \u00a31bn in 2018, equivalent to around 25% of the group\u2019s entire 2015/16 UK wage bill.</p> <p>However, with a highly unionised workforce, which has in the past shown itself willing to flex its muscle in defence members\u2019 rights, introducing an alternative plan is likely to prove costly.

      "bodyText": "Starbucks has blamed a collapse in UK profits on a list of ills including fewer shoppers visiting the high street and the impact of the Brexit vote. Pre-tax profits at the US coffee chain slumped to \u00a313.4m in the year to 2 October 2016, down 60% on the \u00a334.2m it made in 2015. Its turnover declined from \u00a3405.6m to \u00a3379.9m. \u201cStarbucks in the UK has experienced significant economic and geopolitical headwinds this year which affected sales,\u201d the company said in accounts filed at Companies House. It also pointed to \u201cslowing economic growth\u201d and the \u201cimpact of Brexit\u201d as among the factors hitting consumer confidence. \u201cThe general consumer environment was more cautious than the prior year with footfall noticeably down across the store estate leading to lower sales,\u201d the company added. Sales at stores open more than one year were down by 1% over the period. Starbucks became the poster child for corporate tax avoidance in 2012 after details of its meagre tax contribution emerged. The furore prompted a deal with HMRC to waive tax deductions and pay \u00a320m in voluntary corporation tax over two years, including \u00a311.2m in 2014. The deterioration in the UK chain\u2019s profitability meant the amount of corporation tax due dropped from last year\u2019s \u00a37m to \u00a32.7m. However, a \u00a32.9m payment \u201cin respect of prior years\u201d meant its total bill was \u00a36.7m compared with 2015\u2019s \u00a38.4m. Starbucks is in the process of restructuring the UK chain as it moves away from company-run stores and these changes also weighed on the company\u2019s financial performance. It has been renegotiating leases and closing unprofitable stores as well as transferring shops to its licence and franchise partners. Today just over a third of its 894 stores are actually company-run. \u201cWhilst there are undoubted challenges presented by a more cautious consumer environment, lower high street footfall, and adverse currency impacts, we are investing significantly to drive innovation in our food and coffee offering, and are greatly encouraged by our customers\u2019 response,\u201d said Martin Brok, president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. \u201cThe UK remains one of the most important EMEA markets for us and we will continue to grow where our customers want to find us,\u201d he added. Over the past decade Starbucks has faced fierce competition in the UK as rival chain Costa Coffee grew rapidly to become the market leader. The battle for lunchtime trade has also intensified, with chains from Pret a Manger to Greggs serving up speciality coffees. A recent market report by consultancy Allegra Strategies shows that, despite Starbucks recent experiences, the UK\u2019s thirst for coffee is growing with about 23,000 coffee shops contributing an estimated \u00a38.9bn to the economy. The report said 3.4 new coffee shops opened every day. \u201cThe UK has embraced coffee culture in a phenomenal way that has seen the industry grow and thrive to the size it is today \u2013 and it\u2019s continuing,\u201d said Jeffrey Young, chief executive of consultancy Allegra Strategies.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Unions have threatened to disrupt Royal Mail deliveries with possible strike action, after the company said it would close its defined-benefit pension plan next year. The plan, which has 90,000 members \u2013 two-thirds of Royal Mail\u2019s workforce \u2013 and assets of \u00a37.4bn, is in surplus, but Royal Mail said this would run out next year and the scheme would become unaffordable. The company, which was privatised in October 2013, currently pays \u00a3400m a year into the fund but it says this could rise to more than \u00a31bn in 2018. The scheme, which was closed to new members in 2008, guarantees a pension based on a postal worker\u2019s average salary, and Royal Mail is thought to have plans to replace it with a less generous defined-contribution scheme. Royal Mail said it had consulted members and unions and defended its plans. \u201cWe have concluded that there is no affordable solution to keeping the plan open in its current form,\u201d it said. \u201cTherefore, the company has come to the decision that the plan will close to future accrual on 31 March 2018, subject to trustee approval.\u201d The Communication Workers Union slammed the decision, and vowed \u201cthe strongest possible opposition including a ballot for industrial action\u201d. Unite, the UK\u2019s largest union, also threatened potential strike action if a better pension deal with the company is not reached. Ray Ellis of CWU said the unions had put together an alternative proposal a few weeks ago, called the \u201cwage in retirement\u201d scheme, which would preserve the defined-benefit plan but share the risk between the employer and employees, and would not increase Royal Mail\u2019s costs. He said: \u201cThe company has been at pains to assure us that they are committed to seeking an agreed solution, but at the moment it doesn\u2019t seem to be prepared to accept any element of risk falling on the company.\u201d He added: \u201cWe will not stand by and watch the company abandon the pension promises it made at the time of privatisation which threatens our members with massive cuts to their future pension benefits and insecurity and poverty in retirement.\u201d CWU said employees face losing up to a third of their future pensions. For a 50-year-old member earning \u00a325,000 a year and retiring at 65, this would equate to a loss of \u00a34,392 a year (\u00a3109,800 over 25 years). A Royal Mail spokesperson said under its proposal, only a \u201cvery small percentage\u201d would see this level of reduction in their pension. For those leaving Royal Mail before that age and members close to retirement the changes are expected to have a smaller effect. \u201cThe impact of the proposed changes will depend on age, length of service and which part of the scheme a member is in ... We are not proposing to change the benefits members build up before April 2018.\u201d The spokesperson warned that any industrial action, or threat of it, undermined the trust between Royal Mail and its customers and it could lose business as a result. The 500-year-old organisation is battling a decline in its letter business and faces a fiercely competitive parcel market. The company added that is was still in talks with the unions over a \u201csustainable and affordable solution for the provision of future pension benefits\u201d. Brian Scott of Unite said: \u201cThe Royal Mail Pension Plan is not closing in its entirety as the replacement pension scheme will embrace part of that. It is very likely that it will still be a different form of the current defined-benefit scheme. We will study the implications of today\u2019s announcement very carefully and consider all the options going forward. If we don\u2019t achieve a satisfactory outcome, we can\u2019t rule out an industrial action ballot on this issue.\u201d Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, warned that this could turn into a costly battle for Royal Mail. \u201cWith a highly unionised workforce, which has in the past shown itself willing to flex its muscle in defence members\u2019 rights, introducing an alternative plan is likely to prove costly. Whether those costs will be in the form of chunky employer contributions to a new defined contribution scheme or lost revenue from industrial action remains to be seen.\u201d Other companies including Marks &amp; Spencer and Tata Steel UK also have plans to end defined-benefit pension plans.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s article 50 letter might have dominated the front pages in Britain but it was met with a shrug in San Francisco, where 30 tech leaders from the north of England recently embarked on a four-day mission to woo, impress and tempt cash from Silicon Valley\u2019s top dealmakers. Anxiety over the future of Britain outside Europe has not, it seems, spread to the home of Facebook, Twitter and Google. \u201cInvestors here just don\u2019t know what Brexit means yet,\u201d said Gerald Brady, managing director of the multibillion-dollar lender Silicon Valley Bank. However, that is not stopping EU27 countries from making furtive attempts to lure British entrepreneurs overseas. \u201cOther European countries are trying to attract talent by saying, \u2018Hey, come to Ireland, or Holland or Germany because we\u2019ve got free movement of people and if your number one issue is talent, we\u2019re gonna be able to help you get engineers.\u2019 That\u2019s happening today,\u201d Brady said. Matt Haworth, the co-founder of Manchester-based \u201ctech for good\u201d agency Reason Digital, said he and other entrepreneurs had been targeted with Facebook adverts from authorities in Estonia and Transylvania since Britain voted to leave the European Union. But it will take more than that to lure Haworth and others away from northern England, where a rapidly growing technology sector has led to a boom in investment in Britain\u2019s former industrial heartlands. Investment in northern tech businesses reached a 10-year high last year at \u00a3327m, up from \u00a320m in 2007, according to the government agency Tech North, as startup clusters developed in Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and the north-east. Sunderland, which is about as far removed as you can get from Silicon Valley, has the fastest-growing digital turnover in the UK behind London, according to Tech City UK. GP Bullhound, an investment bank, says the north now has 12 tech \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2013 that is, companies valued at more than $1bn \u2013 which is more than Sweden or Germany. They include some of the UK\u2019s biggest tech businesses, such as the software giant Sage and The Hut, the online retailer with an annual turnover of \u00a3335m. Northern tech businesses received a further boost recently when Virgin Atlantic launched its inaugural flight from Manchester to San Francisco, the first direct UK route outside London. Entrepreneurs hope it will tempt US investors to look outside the capital, where tech companies received \u00a31.4bn of the \u00a31.9bn invested in the industry last year, according to the mayor of London\u2019s promotional firm London &amp; Partners. The northern tech scene might not be under threat from Brexit, but there remains significant barriers to competing with London. Founders complain that UK investors are far more risk-averse than their US counterparts, stifling the growth of young companies. Scott Fletcher, the founder of IT firm ANS, believes Manchester\u2019s wealth of former Premier League footballers, such as Gary Neville, should open their chequebooks to the region\u2019s top tech-talent. \u201cGary Neville is a one in a million in that he\u2019s an entrepreneur as well, but when you approach other footballers all they\u2019ve known all their life is football,\u201d said Fletcher. \u201cThey always have advisers and agents around them who have got a vested interest so trying to get access to them is quite difficult, and they\u2019ll generally go for safer investments. You\u2019ve got to be willing, when you invest in tech startups, to lose all your money.\u201d Jamil Khalil, the founder of Manchester-based social curation platform Wakelet, said \u201cso-called early-stage investors\u201d in Britain made him feel like quitting many times when he was knocked back because the business was not yet making a profit. Luke Massie, the 23-year-old founder of secondary ticket marketplace Vibe Tickets, said Silicon Valley benefited from an \u201cecosystem that props up startups\u201d, unlike the UK. \u201cInvestors over here [in San Francisco] are backing growth, whereas in the UK they\u2019re focused on profitability, which means over here a company like mine can focus on your main challenge \u2013 spending \u00a31 and making two from it,\u201d he said. Andy McLoughlin, a British-born San Francisco-based investor, said Silicon Valley\u2019s view of the UK was still heavily London-centric. \u201cGetting more British startups to the west coast \u2013 where they can taste the pace of innovation and scale of thinking \u2013 can only be a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a single new flight route won\u2019t put the north of England on top-tier Silicon Valley venture capitalists\u2019 radars. It\u2019ll take a sustained ecosystem producing numerous great companies \u2013 something that London has only really started to do in the last five to 10 years.\u201d A more significant challenge to the northern powerhouse lies in the ageing road and rail network, which business leaders say is causing Britain to lose out on potentially billions of pounds in growth and thousands of jobs. The trade minister, Greg Hands, was lobbied privately recently by entrepreneurs to sort out the north\u2019s woeful transport infrastructure at a networking event to mark the launch of the Virgin Atlantic flight. Phase two of the long-delayed HS2 rail network, from the West Midlands to Leeds and Manchester, is scheduled to begin operating in 2033 but businesses have demanded urgent investment to slash travel times between the north\u2019s major cities. Charlie Cornish, the chief executive of Manchester Airports Group, said growth in the north would continue to be held back without government action. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive part of the UK economy, and for Manchester airport to continue to grow and prosper and create more jobs, it will help to narrow that north-south divide. But unless you\u2019ve got connectivity across the north, it\u2019s very difficult to see how you can narrow that north-south divide.,\u201d he said. Speaking at Manchester airport, Hands said increasing connectivity in the north was a government priority. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a big infrastructure programme over the course of this parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cHS2 is obviously right at the centre of that but we\u2019re also looking at smaller large schemes to increase and improve connectivity within the north. One of the things I hear businesses right the way across the north say is that one of the most important issues for them is connectivity to Manchester airport.\u201d",

It\u2019ll take a sustained ecosystem producing numerous great companies \u2013 something that London has only really started to do in the last five to 10 years.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00ac605764a65139bd4346498e98fbaaf2ea91f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00ac605764a65139bd4346498e98fbaaf2ea91f9/0_246_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tallinn.

The Estonian authorities have been trying to woo UK tech firms worried about the end of free movement after Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A more significant challenge to the northern powerhouse lies in the ageing road and rail network, which business leaders say is causing Britain to lose out on potentially billions of pounds in growth and thousands of jobs. The trade minister, Greg Hands, was lobbied privately recently by entrepreneurs to sort out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/02/business-leaders-call-for-transport-revolution-to-rebalance-uk-economy\">the north\u2019s woeful transport infrastructure</a> at a networking event to mark the launch of the Virgin Atlantic flight.</p> <p>Phase two of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/15/delayed-hs2-second-phase-route-plan-unveiled\">long-delayed HS2 rail network</a>, from the West Midlands to Leeds and Manchester, is scheduled to begin operating in 2033 but businesses have demanded urgent investment to slash travel times between the north\u2019s major cities. </p> <p>Charlie Cornish, the chief executive of Manchester Airports Group, said growth in the north would continue to be held back without government action.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a massive part of the UK economy, and for Manchester airport to continue to grow and prosper and create more jobs, it will help to narrow that north-south divide. But unless you\u2019ve got connectivity across the north, it\u2019s very difficult to see how you can narrow that north-south divide.,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Speaking at Manchester airport, Hands said increasing connectivity in the north was a government priority.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a big infrastructure programme over the course of this parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cHS2 is obviously right at the centre of that but we\u2019re also looking at smaller large schemes to increase and improve connectivity within the north. One of the things I hear businesses right the way across the north say is that one of the most important issues for them is connectivity to Manchester airport.\u201d</p>",
