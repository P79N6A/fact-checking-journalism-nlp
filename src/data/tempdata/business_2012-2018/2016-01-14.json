At least three parents had their accounts suspended after ordering four tins of baby formula. There has been an unprecedented shortage of formula in Australia thanks to high demand for the product in China, which has led to Chinese tourists, students and relatives living in Australia bulk-buying it to sell on Taobao and other Chinese websites at premium prices, or to send to their relatives. It has prompted many stores, including the supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths, to limit the number of tins sold to each customer.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "French ministers have said that no \u201cdefeat device\u201d or fraudulent software in Renault engines has been found, after the carmaker\u2019s share price plunged on Thursday following reports that police had raided its premises. Shares in Renault tumbled more than 20% on Thursday morning as investors feared that the French manufacturer could be drawn into the VW diesel emissions scandal, after unions revealed that fraud investigators had searched three sites the previous week. Shares rallied to leave Renault down around 10% by the end of the day. Renault confirmed the raids had taken place but denied that any evidence of defeat devices had been discovered, before France\u2019s ecology and energy minister, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, moved to calm speculation. Royal said that the French independent technical commission set up in the wake of the VW scandal, which presented its results to the minister in a meeting on Thursday, had found nothing wrong in Renault\u2019s cars. She told journalists: \u201cThere is no fraud at Renault. Shareholders and employees should be reassured.\u201d However, Royal confirmed that Renault cars did emit carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions above accepted limits in their tests. Renault pledged in late 2015 that it would invest \u20ac50m (\u00a338m) to bring its cars\u2019 real-world emissions into line with those recorded under official test conditions. As news of last week\u2019s police raid emerged, Renault\u2019s shares fell sharply, wiping \u20ac5bn (\u00a33.7bn) off the company\u2019s market value and depressing European markets. Already down around 2% on the back of lower oil prices, the French stock market, CAC, and its German counterpart, the DAX, extended their losses to more than 3% after the Renault reports. A second French politician, economy minister Emmanuel Macron, played down the raids as \u201cnormal\u201d checks, adding that no stigma was attached to Renault. The company said investigators had decided to carry out additional checks on parts and factories to look at the way it uses exhaust emissions technology, following an earlier investigation by the French government. The CGT union said that investigators took the personal computers of several Renault directors. A union official, Florent Grimaldi, told Reuters: \u201cThere were searches at several Renault sites by fraud investigators. Management has not confirmed that it is about NOx emissions but given the sectors that were inspected we think that it could be linked.\u201d Shares in other carmakers also fell, with Peugeot down 5% even though the company said emissions tests carried out by the French energy ministry on its cars showed no anomalies and that it had not been subject to searches by fraud investigators. In Frankfurt, Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen also fell sharply alongside Renault, although they recovered much of their losses during later trading. Volkswagen\u2019s rivals have been drawn into the fallout from the scandal after increased focus on the real level of emissions from engines, which have been far higher in most vehicles than official test results show, even without the kind of cheat devices used at VW. Volkswagen is still facing fines that could potentially run into tens of billions of dollars in the US since it admitted rigging emissions tests for a range of its diesel vehicles. The Environmental Protection Agency and VW are still in talks over remedies for around 500,000 affected diesel cars in the US, after Californian regulators rejected VW\u2019s plans for a recall earlier this week. VW\u2019s chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, suggested fitting a catalytic converter could address the problem on most vehicles, though German press reports have suggested more than 100,000 cars would need to be bought back. In the meantime, VW has pledged at least $1,000 worth of compensation to American owners. However, VW\u2019s UK managing director has said there will be no compensation paid to British motorists, where 1.2m cars are affected. In a letter to the Commons transport select committee, Paul Willis said that VW did \u201cnot believe it was necessary\u201d to compensate owners and that only \u201cgoodwill payments\u201d tailored to different countries were being considered by the manufacturer. Consumer groups in Britain called on the government to introduce tougher measures. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: \u201cVolkswagen customers will be angry at this news and simply will not understand why US consumers are getting a goodwill payment and they\u2019re not. British consumers deserve to be treated fairly. We urge Volkswagen to reconsider its position.\u201d VW disputes that the software installed in its affected diesel cars constitutes a \u201cdefeat device\u201d in the EU, although it has accepted that the same software constitutes a defeat device in the US, under a \u201cdifferent regulatory framework\u201d. MPs said they would be recalling Willis for further questioning by the committee.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A solid performance by the German economy and hints of a delay to the next US interest rate rise calmed nerves in London and New York after a week of panicked stock market trading that has left many investors counting huge losses. The Dow Jones index of leading US corporations climbed 225 points on Thursday while the FTSE 100 reversed a 130 loss in early trading to finish 42 points lower at 5918. The recovery began following figures showing that Germany\u2019s economy recorded its fastest growth since the early days of the eurozone debt crisis with a 1.7% rise during 2015. Berlin also boasted a second consecutive budget surplus \u2013 in contrast to most European countries including the UK, which continue to run deficits. Official figures showed a surplus of 0.5% of GDP in 2015 after a 0.6% surplus in 2014. New York stock markets continued the rally after James Bullard, a senior member of the US Federal Reserve known for his hawkish comments, indicated that the central bank remained cautious after its December rate rise. He said the turmoil in global oil markets seen earlier in the week, which analysts expect to continue for many months, may have caused a \u201cworrisome\u201d drop in inflation expectations that will make it harder for the Fed to raise rates further. Bullard said: \u201cLow inflation expectations may keep actual inflation lower, all else equal, making it more difficult for the Fed to return inflation to target.\u201d A delay to the Fed\u2019s next interest rate rise will keep borrowing costs at historic lows, pleasing investors that want the consumers and businesses to continue having access to cheap credit. Oil prices rose after dropping briefly below $30 a barrel late on Wednesday, though Brent crude only nudged back to $30.54. The 70% drop in oil prices since the summer of 2014 has proved to be the biggest drag on inflation across the western economies and a cause of instability in the Middle East and other oil producing regions, including Russia. US stock markets were also bouyed by comments from Abby Joseph Cohen, president of Goldman Sachs\u2019 global markets institute. The veteran Wall Street operator said the plunge in US markets earlier in the week obscured expansion in both the American economy and corporate profits. \u201cWhat is happening is really very much an emotional response,\u201d she told Bloomberg TV. \u201cWe need to put things into perspective. Stocks are probably the best place to be.\u201d In early trading, London\u2019s blue chip FTSE 100 index fell to its lowest level in almost five months during early trading, hit by falls in downgraded travel and leisure stocks, though Tesco rose after the UK\u2019s largest supermarket chain posted strong sales figures. The index is down by about 6% since the start of this year and down nearly 20% from last April\u2019s record high of 7,122.74 points. \u201cThis market is in contraction and I expect this contraction to continue for the next six months,\u201d Beaufort Securities trader Basil Petrides said.",

Official figures showed a surplus of 0.5% of GDP in 2015 after a 0.6% surplus in 2014.</p> <p>New York stock markets continued the rally after James Bullard, a senior member of the US Federal Reserve known for his hawkish comments, indicated that the central bank remained cautious <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/16/federal-reserve-us-interest-rate-rise-fed-funds-janet-yellen\">after its December rate rise</a>. He said the turmoil in global oil markets seen earlier in the week, which analysts expect to continue for many months, may have caused a \u201cworrisome\u201d drop in inflation expectations that will make it harder for the Fed to raise rates further.</p> <p>Bullard said: \u201cLow inflation expectations may keep actual inflation lower, all else equal, making it more difficult for the Fed to return inflation to target.\u201d<br></p> <p>A delay to the Fed\u2019s next interest rate rise will keep borrowing costs at historic lows, pleasing investors that want the consumers and businesses to continue having access to cheap credit.</p> <p>Oil prices rose after dropping briefly below $30 a barrel late on Wednesday, though Brent crude only nudged back to $30.54.</p> <p>The 70% drop in oil prices since the summer of 2014 has proved to be the biggest drag on inflation across the western economies and a cause of instability in the Middle East and other oil producing regions, including Russia. </p> <p>US stock markets were also bouyed by comments from Abby Joseph Cohen, president of Goldman Sachs\u2019 global markets institute. The veteran Wall Street operator said the plunge in US markets earlier in the week obscured expansion in both the American economy and corporate profits. \u201cWhat is happening is really very much an emotional response,\u201d she told Bloomberg TV. \u201cWe need to put things into perspective. Stocks are probably the best place to be.\u201d</p> <p>In early trading, London\u2019s blue chip FTSE 100 index fell to its lowest level in almost five months during early trading, hit by falls in downgraded travel and leisure stocks, though <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/14/tesco-beats-forecasts-with-christmas-sales-rise\">Tesco rose after the UK\u2019s largest supermarket chain posted strong sales figures</a>.</p> <p>The index is down by about 6% since the start of this year and down nearly 20% from last April\u2019s record high of 7,122.74 points.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis market is in contraction and I expect this contraction to continue for the next six months,\u201d Beaufort Securities trader Basil Petrides said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The boss of Home Retail Group has insisted the company does not need a takeover despite warning that poor sales at its Argos chain would hit profits. The group, which is in the sights of Sainsburys and received a \u00a31bn approach from the grocer in November, said like-for-like sales, which exclude gains from new store space, had tumbled 2.2% in the 18 weeks to 2 January. City analysts had forecast a 0.3% rise. Online sales rose 10% in December, but that wasn\u2019t enough to make up for a 13% slump at the high street store chain. Sales of games consoles, large kitchen appliances and jewellery were all down. Profit margins were also down by more than 2 percentage points with Argos selling more items at a discount as a result of Black Friday. As a result, Home Retail said profits for the group would now be about \u00a392m, about 10% below the average forecast. The warning is the second downgrade for Home Retail in less than three months. The company said in October that it was not sure if its investment in delivery vans and advertising ahead of Black Fridaywould pay off. The group\u2019s DIY chain Homebase, which is to be sold to Australia\u2019s Wesfarmers for \u00a3340m in a deal announced late on Wednesday, reported a 5% rise in sales at established stores, bolstered by purchases of kitchen and bathroom goods. Chief executive John Walden said that despite the poor performance, Argos was a \u201cstrong business\u201d. \u201cThe capabilities we are building are going to play into the digital future. We are not feeling we would be a weaker business [if Homebase is sold] but a stronger business with an improved balance sheet,\u201d he said. The American said the sale of Homebase would give the group cash to invest in updating Argos\u2019 stores and delivery systems. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a tie-up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel good about what we are building and know what we are becoming is of value.\u201d He said Argos had proved that the idea of concessions in other stores worked and that it would be able to find alternative partners if Homebase, or Sainsbury\u2019s, pushed it out. Tony Shiret, an analyst at Haitong Research, said the rationale for Sainsbury\u2019s buying Argos \u201cshould theoretically have been damaged by the trading results\u201d. He suggested that the supermarket\u2019s shareholders would want a low price to compensate for the risk of a deal. David Jeary, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said: \u201cWe believe today\u2019s trading update [from Home Retail] makes a bid from Sainsbury\u2019s less rather than more likely.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s management team made clear on Wednesday that they would not overpay for Home Retail and Jeary said any share-based offer from the supermarket may not be attractive as it would expose the Argos-owner\u2019s investors to the highly competitive grocery market. \u201cFor Home Retail shareholders its a choice between the devil you know or the deep blue sea,\u201d Jeary said. Sainsbury\u2019s has until 2 February to return with a new bid for Home Retail but has made clear it is only interested in the Argos chain.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An insider dealing ring that made \u00a37.4m from trading in just six stock market companies used burner phones, offshore companies, code names and encrypted memory sticks to mask their crimes, a court was told on Thursday. The conspiracy started to unravel after the Belgravia offices of the veteran trader Ben Anderson, 71, were bugged by City regulators, prosecutors said. Mark Ellison QC told a jury at Southwark crown court that investigators had been able to trace the extensive trading activities of Anderson and his sometime partner, Iraj Parvizi, through a middleman, Andrew Hind, and back to two senior City bankers regularly in possession of price-sensitive information. It was one of the most sophisticated insider dealing rings ever discovered in the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority believes. Anderson, Parvizi and Hind, together with Martyn Dodgson, a former corporate broker for Deutsche Bank, and Grant Harrison, a former broker for Panmure Gordon, all plead not guilty to charges of conspiracy to insider deal between 2006 and 2010. When he was arrested six years ago, Dodgson, who was paid \u00a3601,000 as a managing director at Deutsche Bank, told police he had never had any involvement in share trading or spread betting on shares. Prosecuting counsel told the court he had also said that \u201che would not dare to advise anyone on trading or spread betting as it was too easy to lose a lot of money\u201d. On his keyring, investigators found the key for a secure metal box at his home in Hampstead, north London, which contained an a specialist encrypted flash drive that allows users to store files and browse the internet without leaving a trace or an IP address. Dodgson said he had not used the device in years and could not unlock it. By cross-checking other passwords the banker had used elsewhere, however, investigators were able to discover that the drive was opened by the password \u201cLamborghini55\u201d. On it, Ellison told the court, was incriminating evidence including a spreadsheet which investigators had been able to open after trying another of his well-used passwords, \u201cMaserati\u201d. Dodgson confirmed Hind was a close friend and the two men spoke three or four times a week. If they ever discussed Dodgson\u2019s work in passing, the banker told police, it would never concern trading. He had not known Hind was in the habit of making spread bets. Investigators discovered Hind had bought six encrypted USB sticks, with three being found in a wall safe at his home. When asked for the passwords, he declined to provide them. Investigators have been unable to access the sticks. Hind is said to have used unregistered pay-as-you-go mobile phones \u2013 often known as burners \u2013 to communicate with Anderson and Parvizi. The two traders, who referred to Hind as \u201cNobu\u201d, were already extremely active spread betters so insider trading carried out under cover of their day-to-day dealings was unlikely to ring alarm bells among City regulators, Ellison said. Anderson and Parvizi admit adding their own funds to investments carried out on behalf of Hind, but both insist they had no reason to suspect Hind\u2019s stock picks were based on price-sensitive insider information. In a bugged conversation at Anderson\u2019s office, Ellison told the jury the trader was on one occasion recorded saying: \u201cIf he was ever pulled in, he would deny he ever knew Nobu.\u201d The proceeds, Ellison said, were distributed through offshore companies and foreign bank accounts. In some instances invoices were submitted for services other than trading, or gains were disbursed through cash handovers or payments-in-kind. Hind had given Parvizi an unregistered sim card for his phone and, when the two spoke, they referred to one another as \u201cNobu\u201d and \u201cFatty\u201d. The case continues.",

      "body": "<p>An insider dealing ring that made \u00a37.4m from trading in just six stock market companies used burner phones, offshore companies, code names and encrypted memory sticks to mask their crimes, a court was told on Thursday.</p> <p>The conspiracy started to unravel after the Belgravia offices of the veteran trader Ben Anderson, 71, were bugged by City regulators, prosecutors said.</p> <p>Mark Ellison QC told a jury at Southwark crown court that investigators had been able to trace the extensive trading activities of Anderson and his sometime partner, Iraj Parvizi, through a middleman, Andrew Hind, and back to two senior City bankers regularly in possession of price-sensitive information. <br></p> <p>It was one of the most sophisticated insider dealing rings ever discovered in the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority believes. Anderson, Parvizi and Hind, together with Martyn Dodgson, a former corporate broker for Deutsche Bank, and Grant Harrison, a former broker for Panmure Gordon, all plead not guilty to charges of conspiracy to insider deal between 2006 and 2010.</p> <p>When he was arrested six years ago, Dodgson, who was paid \u00a3601,000 as a managing director at Deutsche Bank, told police he had never had any involvement in share trading or spread betting on shares. Prosecuting counsel told the court he had also said that \u201che would not dare to advise anyone on trading or spread betting as it was too easy to lose a lot of money\u201d.</p> <p>On his keyring, investigators found the key for a secure metal box at his home in Hampstead, north London, which contained an a specialist encrypted flash drive that allows users to store files and browse the internet without leaving a trace or an IP address. Dodgson said he had not used the device in years and could not unlock it. By cross-checking other passwords the banker had used elsewhere, however, investigators were able to discover that the drive was opened by the password \u201cLamborghini55\u201d. </p> <p>On it, Ellison told the court, was incriminating evidence including a spreadsheet which investigators had been able to open after trying another of his well-used passwords, \u201cMaserati\u201d.<br></p> <p>Dodgson confirmed Hind was a close friend and the two men spoke three or four times a week. If they ever discussed Dodgson\u2019s work in passing, the banker told police, it would never concern trading. He had not known Hind was in the habit of making spread bets.</p> <p>Investigators discovered Hind had bought six encrypted USB sticks, with three being found in a wall safe at his home. When asked for the passwords, he declined to provide them. Investigators have been unable to access the sticks. <br></p> <p>Hind is said to have used unregistered pay-as-you-go mobile phones \u2013 often known as burners \u2013 to communicate with Anderson and Parvizi. The two traders, who referred to Hind as \u201cNobu\u201d, were already extremely active spread betters so insider trading carried out under cover of their day-to-day dealings was unlikely to ring alarm bells among City regulators, Ellison said. <br></p> <p>Anderson and Parvizi admit adding their own funds to investments carried out on behalf of Hind, but both insist they had no reason to suspect Hind\u2019s stock picks were based on price-sensitive insider information. <br></p> <p>In a bugged conversation at Anderson\u2019s office, Ellison told the jury the trader was on one occasion recorded saying: \u201cIf he was ever pulled in, he would deny he ever knew Nobu.\u201d <br></p> <p>The proceeds, Ellison said, were distributed through offshore companies and foreign bank accounts.

    "webTitle": "European shares hit by Renault raid and oil volatility but Wall Street rallies - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A rally on Wall Street after Wednesday\u2019s slump helped European shares come off their worst levels, but they still ended the day in the red. Oil recovered some ground after falling below $30 a barrel, with Brent crude currently 2% higher at $30.94, but investors are clearly still worried about the weakness in commodities and the outlook for China. More worries for the car industry, with Renault being raided, added to the downbeat mood and helped push the Dax and Cac - which have a number of listed carmakers - lower. Meanwhile US shares, after a weak start, recovered some of their recent losses, helped by dovish comments from Federal Reserve member James Bullard. Bullard had been pushing for rate rises and finally got his way in December, but a cautious speech in the wake of the oil price fall and the current market rout suggested he might be moderating his views on when further rate rises could be sanctioned. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 42.74 points or 0.72% lower at 5918.23, having earlier touched a new five month low Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.67% to 9794.20 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.8% at 4312.89 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.67% to 19,803.41 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.64% lower at 8787.7 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.62% to 573.92 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 191 points or 1.1% better. On Friday there are a number of economic figures which could add to the volatile mood. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said; We\u2019ve got UK construction statistics due for release in the morning and these will be closely followed as they may offer some respite from the swathe of downbeat economic prints we\u2019ve seen of late. Also, US retail sales and consumer confidence numbers will be under scrutiny as the market looks for clues of any impact from the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hike. It\u2019s been a rollercoaster session, but it\u2019s certainly good to be finishing with losses that are so limited. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. With the US rally helping to pull European shares away from their worst levels, Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: Markets remain stuck in a closely-fought contest between the optimists and pessimists, and while in Europe the latter still appear to be in charge, on Wall Street the buyers are back. Just as US markets yesterday torpedoed a nascent rally, today our American cousins are doing their best to stymie any further bearish momentum. Car makers dominate the news today, with Fiat Chrysler, Peugeot and Renault all hit hard, with the latter two due to an emissions investigation that doubtless has its roots in the VW scandal of 2015. As with banks, investors are learning that scandals do not tend to stop at one firm, and with car firms so prominent on the French and German exchanges, it is no surprise that the CAC and DAX remain firmly in the red. Oil prices are enjoying a rare pause in their downward slide, but it still looks to be only a matter of time before they continue their exploration of the $20 zone. The combination of bearish factors remains the key driver, with no hint of real production cuts coming from the key producers Further helping sentiment was a decent set of figures from JPMorgan, which rose 2%, with strict cost control helping and return on equity holding at a steady 9%. A rebound in oil prices is helping markets recover some of their early losses. Brent crude is now up 2% at $31 a barrel. Did we mention volatile? The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now 161 points higher, helping pull European markets off their worst levels. The European Central Bank could cut its deposit rate further after last month\u2019s reduction, according to the minutes of the December meeting, with inflation in danger of missing its targets. They said: A cut in the deposit facility rate of 10 basis points was seen as unlikely to trigger material negative side effects and was also seen as having the advantage of leaving some room for further downward adjustments. Economist Timo del Carpio at RBC Capital Markets said: The ECB\u2019s latest Meeting Account reveals something of a rift within the Governing Council. However, while we already knew that support for action was not unanimous, the debate itself was not as\u2018binary\u2019 as some might have assumed. In particular, at least some of those who argued against the proposed measures still favoured providing further stimulus of some kind. Thus, while we continue to judge that monetary policy settings will remain on hold at the forthcoming meeting, the actual policy debate looks set to remain as lively as ever, not least in the context of the renewed downside risks to inflation. After a brief attempt at a rally as Wall Street opened, US markets are following the rest of the world lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 59 points or 0.3% lower despite the oil market stablising. So the volatile pattern of recent days is continuing, with sentiment not helped by JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon saying that the US economy could worsen after its recent growth. James Bullard, one of the members of the US Federal Reserve, has been keen to raise interest rates and got his way in December. But with many analysts believing the current market rout and worries about the Chinese economy should delay any further rises from the Fed, even Bullard is sounding more cautious. Reuters reports: The continued rout in global oil markets may have caused a \u201cworrisome\u201d drop in U.S. inflation expectations that will make it harder for the Federal Reserve to reach one of its key policy targets, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Thursday. Since the dramatic fall in oil began in 2014 Fed officials have insisted the impact on U.S. price levels would be temporary, bottoming out at some point and allowing inflation to rise to the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target. Bullard said that in general he still feels that is the case, with low oil prices an overall \u201cbullish factor for the U.S.\u201d that is supporting consumer spending and record levels of auto sales. But he said both market-based and long-term measures of inflation expectations have been declining, and their continued fall \u201cis becoming worrisome.\u201d Household and business expectations about inflation are considered a key component determining actual price increases, and, if they become unmoored to the downside, could pull the rate of inflation lower in a way that is difficult to change. \u201cLow inflation expectations may keep actual inflation lower, all else equal, making it more difficult for the Fed to return inflation to target,\u201d Bullard said. Over in the US, and the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefit rose unexpectedly last week. Initial jobless claims climbed by 7,000 to 284,000, compared with forecasts of a fall to 275,000. But this is the 45th week that claims have been below 300,000, confirming the view that the US jobs market is currently fairly robust. This follows the December non-farm payroll figures which showed a surge in job numbers. Meanwhile US import prices fell 1.2% in December, the sixth monthly decline as the effects of the collapse in oil prices continues to be felt. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, also reckons the BoE won\u2019t raise rates in the next few months: He argues that there\u2019s simply not a strong reason to hike borrowing costs, given inflation is almost zero and wage growth just 2%. \u201cThe outcome of January\u2019s meeting points firmly away from a majority of the MPC favouring a rate rise anytime soon. Notably, none of the three criteria for considering a rate rise as set out by the Governor in a speech in July last year \u2013 quarterly GDP growth in excess of 0.6%, a convincing pick-up in core inflation and a sustained rise in wage growth \u2013 are currently present. \u201cTherefore, we stick with our view that the first hike is most likely to come towards the end of the year. If anything the recent global financial turmoil emphasises that the risks are skewed towards a longer period of inaction. So if not today, when might UK interest rates rise? Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, reckons the Bank of England will sit tight until the EU referendum has been held - perhaps in June, or September. The recent decline in the oil price will have played a part in the MPC\u2019s thinking, not so much because they see it as a signal of poor global growth prospects, but because it will keep inflation lower in 2016 than they would have expected a few months ago. On top of this, there have been some signs of weakness in the average earnings figures, which is an indicator on their key watch list. \u201cLooking ahead, lower sterling should lead to rising import cost inflation, while the bulk of the labour market data is still relatively strong. There will be no interest rate hike ahead of the Brexit referendum however, given the uncertainties which the vote is already creating.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story about the Renault raids that have given the markets a shunt: The UK government\u2019s plan to hold a referendum on EU membership may have helped weaken the pound this year, the Bank of England says. This is the key section from today\u2019s minutes: The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) had fallen by around 3% since the fifteen-day average starting point used in the November Inflation Report projections. This appeared in part to be a reaction to the ECB policy decision on 3 December 2015. Since the start of 2016, however, some market contacts had additionally cited the forthcoming UK referendum regarding EU membership as a possible explanation for the depreciation of sterling. Option-implied sterling volatilities had risen and there had been an increase in the price of protection against the risk of sterling depreciation compared with the price of protection against an appreciation. The Bank of England also flags up that UK workers aren\u2019t getting large pay rises, with wage growth slowing to 2% last month. Despite continued reductions in the rate of unemployment, pay growth remains restrained and appears to have dipped slightly in the most recent data. Another reason not to dust off the rate-hike button today. The Bank of England\u2019s minutes are online here. The Bank of England admits its latest inflation forecasts now look too optimistic, thanks to the tumbling oil price. In the minutes from today\u2019s meeting, it says: Twelve-month CPI inflation rose to 0.1% in November and is likely to rise modestly further in the coming months as some of the large falls in energy and food prices a year earlier drop out of the annual comparison. But the 40% decline in dollar oil prices means that the increase in inflation is now expected to be slightly more gradual in the near term than forecast in the Committee\u2019s November Inflation Report projections. It also points to the turmoil in the markets: Recent volatility in financial markets has underlined the downside risks to global growth, primarily emanating from emerging markets. Breaking: UK interest rates have been left unchanged at 0.5%, extending a run dating back to March 2009. But it wasn\u2019t unanimous. The Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting committee was split 8-1, with Ian McCafferty continuing to push for higher borrowing costs. The prospect of a new chapter in the car emissions scandal has gone down very badly in Europe. The German DAX and French CAC are now both down at least 3%: Renault is leading the rout, with shares plunging by a fifth. Peugeot are down almost 7%. And in Frankfurt, Daimler are down 5.5%, BMW are off 4.5% and Volkswagen are down 4.6%. Shares in other European automakers are taking a tumble too: The Renault raids suggest that the emissions scandal which began at Volkswagen last year is spreading. French unions officials have confirmed that police visited Renault\u2019s offices last week, and seized several computers. AFP has the details French anti-fraud detectives have raided several production sites of automaker Renault, unions said Thursday, possibly to investigate emissions foul play. \u201cAgents from the (anti-fraud unit) DGCCRF intervened in various Renault sites last Thursday,\u201d the CGT Renault union said in a tract. The probe targeted the sites\u2019 engine control units which suggests, the union said, that the raids \u201care linked to the consequences of the Volkswagen rigged-engines affair\u201d. \u201cThey took the personal computers of several directors,\u201d the union said. \u201cWe yesterday (Wednesday) questioned management about this but received no reply,\u201d Franck Daout, a representative of the CFDT union, told AFP. The CFDT said it had been alerted to the raids by some of its shop floor members. Contacted by AFP, neither the anti-fraud unit nor Renault\u2019s management had any comment. In the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal, Renault said last month that it would invest 50 million euros ($55 million) to bring the real emissions of its cars into line with those measured in official test conditions.  Renault is declining to comment on those reports of a fraud raid, Reuters says. Shares in French carmaker Renault just plunged 15%. The newswires are citing reports that the company\u2019s offices were raided by police last week. Sterling has hit its lowest level against the euro in a year, as traders continue to anticipate that UK interest rates aren\u2019t being hiked anytime soon. One pound is now worth \u20ac1.3147, a level last seen in mid-January 2015. That means one euro is worth 76p. A weakening currency puts more pressure on the Bank of England to consider a rate hike, as it would push up the cost of imported goods. But it will be welcomed by British exporters for the same reason. Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde has blogged about this today, pointing out that fashion chain Burberry cited the weaker euro as a threat to its business this morning. She adds: So there we have it Mr Carney...get the pound to plummet. That\u2019s what would make the business world happier. But of course central banks don\u2019t target exchange rates now, do they...? Perish the thought.... Next week is Davos time, when politicians, policymakers, business leaders and other members of the \u2018global elite\u2019 gather for their annual meeting in Switzerland. And climate change will be high on the agenda. The World Economic Forum has surveyed 750 experts, and found that the threat of global warming is even more serious than other dangers - such as weapons of mass destruction, water crises, mass involuntary migration and a severe energy price shock. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: The report, prepared by the WEF in collaboration with risk specialists Marsh &amp; McLennan and Zurich Insurance Group, comes a month after the deal signed in Paris to reduce carbon emissions. The WEF said evidence was mounting that inter-connections between risks were becoming stronger. It cited links between climate change and involuntary migration or international security, noting that these often had \u201cmajor and unpredictable impacts\u201d. Cecilia Reyes, Zurich\u2019s chief risk officer, said: \u201cClimate change is exacerbating more risks than ever before in terms of water crises, food shortages, constrained economic growth, weaker societal cohesion and increased security risks. \u201cMeanwhile, geopolitical instability is exposing businesses to cancelled projects, revoked licences, interrupted production, damaged assets and restricted movement of funds across borders. These political conflicts are in turn making the challenge of climate change all the more insurmountable \u2013 reducing the potential for political cooperation, as well as diverting resource, innovation and time away from climate change resilience and prevention.\u201d New York\u2019s stock market may stabilise today after Wednesday\u2019s rout wiped 364 points (-2.2%) off the Dow Jones industrial average. Here\u2019s what the futures market is predicting when trading begins in four hour\u2019s time: S&amp;P 500: 2 points higher at 1,892 Dow Jones: 32 points higher at 16,183 Nasdaq 100: 6 points higher at 4,189 There\u2019s plenty of time for this to change, though.... In around 90 minutes time, investors and economists will be poring over the minutes of today\u2019s Bank of England meeting. And while everyone expect interest rates to remain unchanged at 0.5% at noon, the question is now whether the BoE hikes this year. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says borrowing costs will remain unchanged for some time: In the current climate of tumbling oil prices, crashing stock markets and a likely next leg lower for inflation expectations, it is clear the UK rate hike forecasts continue to push further back day by day. In recent months, the Bank\u2019s rate-setting committee has been split 8-1, with Ian McCafferty a lone voice calling for rates to rise to 0.75%. But he might change his mind, given recent events. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency firm World First, predicts McCafferty will return to the fold today. Since the last meeting, oil markets have slumped \u2013 crude oil traded below $30 a barrel for the first time in 12 years overnight \u2013 global growth has slowed, equity markets have dipped and fears, rightly or wrongly, of a recession have increased..... This time last year, following a slump in oil prices, Ian McCafferty decided to stop voting for a rate increase having done so since the autumn. This is probably the key development in today\u2019s meeting. McCafferty has shown that he is willing to change his mind when the data changes \u2013 something of which there is a woeful lack of in central banking \u2013 and a unanimous vote for a hold at 0.5% will solidify pound at these low levels. Although Brent crude is clinging on above $30 this morning, its earlier tumble to $29.73 per barrel continues to pull markets down. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says it\u2019s turning into a bad morning for the City (unless you\u2019ve shorted the market, of course): A strong Christmas performance from Tesco has not been enough to counter a wave of fear striking the FTSE 100 as oil prices slumped and travel stocks were sold off following terrorist attacks in Jakarta. Adding to concerns, the offshore Chinese yuan fell despite the PBOC setting a higher fix for the onshore rate as traders bet on future depreciation. There had been signs that the recovery was petering out in the past day or so but equities finally succumbed when Brent crude prices hit a 12-year low early Thursday. Glad to see my typos are causing amusement.... The attacks in Jakarta today (liveblog here) may also be weighing on shares today, although worries over the global economy appear to be the main driver. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says: Investors have once again realised that nothing has changed and a bounce wasn\u2019t really warranted. A depressed oil price remains hindered by global oversupply and the prospect of it getting worse as Iran returns to market, while China jitters continue to shake everything from commodities to financials. Attacks such as those overnight in Jakarta are also becoming much too frequent even if markets have developed thicker skin.\u201d Today\u2019s selloff has pushed the FTSE 100 down to a five-month intraday low. The blue-chip index hit 5836 this morning, a level not seen since the Great Fall of China last summer. And it trading finished now, the Footsie would be at its lowest closing point since November 2012. Merlin, the theme park group, is leading the selloff after being downgraded by JP Morgan: Germany\u2019s economy has recorded its fastest growth since the early days of the eurozoen eurozone debt crisis. New official figures show that GDP rose by 1.7% during 2015, the best result in four years. ING economist Carsten Brzeski says Germany\u2019s solid recovery continues: It was yet another year in which the German economy defied earlier swan songs and, despite many headwinds like the Greek crisis, the slowdown in emerging markets and China and increased geopolitical uncertainties, continued the recovery. But this could be \u201cas good as it gets\u201d, he adds. Without any new structural reforms and investments it is hard to see any sharp acceleration of the economy any time soon. Separate figures have shown that Germany also posted a budget surplus in 2015. I suspect will reassure many Germans, but irk commentators who believe Germany should be spending more to help the European economy pick up. The FTSE 100 is flirting with is now sporting a triple-digit point loss. The blue-chip index is down 110 points right now at 5849, a loss of almost 1.9%. It\u2019s a broad-based selloff, only defied by retailers such as Tesco who posted surprisingly good results this morning. The turbulent market conditions don\u2019t appear to be going anywhere fast, warns analyst Tony Cross of Trustnet. Yesterday\u2019s modest gains on the FTSE-100 have already been eclipsed as investors become increasingly nervous over the outlook for crude oil. Wall Street sold off heavily into the close last night and this is very much setting the pace, leaving the vast majority of London\u2019s blue chip equities trading squarely in the red. Europe\u2019s markets are bathed in electronic red ink this morning, with major indices all losing at least 1%. Several UK retailers are defying the selloff. Tesco jumped almost 7% to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard after surprising the City with a jump in Christmas sales. Burberry are close behind, up 3%, after announcing sales growth in China again. And among smaller companies, JD Sports are up 5.3% after it said profits would beat expectations this year. Even Home Retail are up, gaining 3.6% despite warning that Argos sales were weak. Traders may be betting there\u2019s more chance that the company will succumb to a new takeover offer from Sainsbury..... And we\u2019re off! European market are falling sharply at the start of trading. In London, the FTSE 100 has slid by 73 points, or 1.2%, to 5887, following the losses in Asia earlier today and on Wall Street last night. Other European indices are down around 1.3%, hit by worries over the global economy and China\u2019s slowdown. The FTSE 100 has now lost 5.5% of its value this month - a rough start to the year. Joe Brent of City firm Liberum explains why: In 2016, UK indices have suffered their worst start since 2008. There is plenty to worry about globally; China, emerging markets, commodity prices, monetary tightening, negative earnings momentum, high valuations and a tired looking bull market. Over in the City, the Bank of England\u2019s policymakers are gathering to set monetary policy. But there\u2019s no chance of a rate rise, given the recent market turbulence and weaker economic data that has sent the pound to its lowest level against the US dollar since 2010. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says: Investor sentiment towards the Sterling continues to weaken ahead of the anticipated Bank of England (BoE) rate decision today, in which markets broadly expect rates to be left unchanged at the record 0.5% low. Since the MPC\u2019s December meeting, the overall outlook for the UK economy has dimmed considerably with a downwards revision of Q3 GDP and a decline in industrial productions renewing concerns around the potential slowdown in economic momentum in the United Kingdom. There\u2019s mixed news from fashion chain Burberry this morning. On the upside, its sales in mainland China are growing again after a worrying slide last year. That helped send retail revenue up 1% in the last three months on 2015. On the downside, turnover in Hong Kong and Macau took a hit in the last quarter. CEO Chris Bailey says it was tougher than expected, as market upheaval hits demand for expensive coats and handbags. While Burberry was impacted by the ongoing challenges facing the luxury sector, headwinds in Hong Kong and Macau masked an otherwise stronger performance in many markets. Home Retail has warned that poor sales at its Argos chain would hit group profits. That\u2019s significant, as the company only recently rebuffed a takeover bid from Sainsbury\u2019s. My colleague Julia Kollewe has the details: Argos posted a 2.2% fall in like-for-like sales in the 18 weeks to 2 January, worse than analysts had expected. Walk-in sales slumped 13% in December, with shopping centre and high street stores badly hit, which was only partly offset by 10% growth in digital sales. Home Retail\u2019s other chain Homebase enjoyed 5% growth, boosted by kitchen and bathroom products. The company confirmed that is in advanced discussions to sell the DIY chain to Australia\u2019s Wesfarmers for \u00a3340m. City analysts are impressed with Tesco\u2019s Christmas performance: On a busy morning for retail news, Tesco is grabbing the headlines. Britain\u2019s largest supermarket has defied its critics by reporting a 1.3% rise in sales over the Christmas period. It suggests CEO Dave Lewis is making good progress in his labours to turn the company around. My colleague Fiona Walsh explains: Tesco cheered the City with news of a much stronger than expected performance over Christmas, pushing sales in its core UK supermarkets business up by 1.3%. Most analysts had been expecting sales to fall. Chief executive Dave Lewis said the group, Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, had benefitted from lower prices on what he called \u201can outstanding range of products.\u201d Brent crude is bobbing around $30.50/barrel this morning, after hitting $29.73 last night. That means motorists should be able to look forward to cheaper fuel costs, given that crude has lost a third of its value since December. Industry body RAC insists that fuel prices should follow suit. Spokesman Simon Williams said: \u201cWith no apparent end in sight to the free-falling price of oil, motorists can expect some really low fuel prices in 2016. \u201cBreaking through the pound a litre price point for both petrol and diesel was clearly a welcome landmark, but it looks as though there is more to come. In fact we may get to a bizarre time when a litre of fuel is cheaper than a litre of some bottled waters.\u201d Angus Nicholson of IG has warned that \u201ca negative feedback loop of self-perpetuating fear seems to have gripped global markets\u201d, as shares dive across Asia. Today\u2019s selloff is also being driven by renewed fears over the situation in China, and the possibility that Beijing will devalue the yuan sharply. Angus explains: China\u2019s poor communication of FX (foreign exchange) policy and concomitant selloff in its equities appear to have lit a fire of negativity beneath global market sentiment. The threat of a dramatic devaluation by the Chinese government to ease its deflationary and debt-related pressures hangs heavy on markets like a Sword of Damocles. Despite China\u2019s successful efforts this week to regain control over the offshore renminbi, the possibility of a major one-off devaluation in the currency is probably far higher than a black swan tail risk event. The fact that it is reportedly even being discussed by People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) advisors likely assigns it a probability as high as 20%. Pessimism has swept through Asia today, sending markets down to a three-year low. The sight of Brent crude oil below $30/barrel prompted big losses across the major indices. Japan\u2019s Nikkei tumbled by 4% at one state, and finished the day down 474 points (down 2.7%) at 17,240. The Australian market shed 1.5%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Tin hats on, chaps. It could be a rough day\u2019s trading in the stock markets, after the latest slide in the oil price hits confidence. Last night, Brent crude oil fell through $30 per barrel for the first time since 2004, after new inventory figures showed that US gasoline stockpiles had hit a record high. That sent Wall Street traders into a selling frenzy last night, as my colleague Rupert Neate explains: US stocks fell heavily on Wednesday, with the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 falling 2.5% to take the index below 1,900 points for the first time since September, due to growing concerns about the falling oil price, which dipped below $30 a barrel for the first time in nearly 12 years. The S&amp;P 500, which closed at 1,890 points, suffered its worst day since September and has fallen by 10% since its November peak taking it into \u201ccorrection\u201d territory, something that has not happened since August 2014. Asian markets have already taken a bath, and Europe is expected to follow suit. Spread-betters are calling the FTSE 100 down over 1%: And it\u2019s a big day for corporate news, with a flurry of retailers reporting Christmas trading. That includes Tesco, Home Retail, Burberry, JD Sports, ASOS, Associated British Foods (which owns Primark), Mothercare, Moss Bros and SuperGroup. We\u2019ll do our best to cover them all.",

Oil recovered some ground after falling below $30 a barrel, with Brent crude currently 2% higher at $30.94, but investors are clearly still worried about the weakness in commodities and the outlook for China.</p> <p>More worries for the car industry, with Renault being raided, added to the downbeat mood and helped push the Dax and Cac - which have a number of listed carmakers - lower.</p> <p>Meanwhile US shares, after a weak start, recovered some of their recent losses, helped by dovish comments from Federal Reserve member James Bullard. Bullard had been pushing for rate rises and finally got his way in December, but a cautious speech in the wake of the oil price fall and the current market rout suggested he might be moderating his views on when further rate rises could be sanctioned.</p> <p>So the final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished 42.74 points or 0.72% lower at 5918.23, having earlier touched a new five month low</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.67% to 9794.20</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.8% at 4312.89</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.67% to 19,803.41</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.64% lower at 8787.7</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.62% to 573.92</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 191 points or 1.1% better.</p> <p>On Friday there are a number of economic figures which could add to the volatile mood. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve got UK construction statistics due for release in the morning and these will be closely followed as they may offer some respite from the swathe of downbeat economic prints we\u2019ve seen of late. Also, US retail sales and consumer confidence numbers will be under scrutiny as the market looks for clues of any impact from the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hike. It\u2019s been a rollercoaster session, but it\u2019s certainly good to be finishing with losses that are so limited.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

Just as US markets yesterday torpedoed a nascent rally, today our American cousins are doing their best to stymie any further bearish momentum. Car makers dominate the news today, with Fiat Chrysler, Peugeot and Renault all hit hard, with the latter two due to an emissions investigation that doubtless has its roots in the VW scandal of 2015. As with banks, investors are learning that scandals do not tend to stop at one firm, and with car firms so prominent on the French and German exchanges, it is no surprise that the CAC and DAX remain firmly in the red.</p> <p>Oil prices are enjoying a rare pause in their downward slide, but it still looks to be only a matter of time before they continue their exploration of the $20 zone. The combination of bearish factors remains the key driver, with no hint of real production cuts coming from the key producers</p> <p>Further helping sentiment was a decent set of figures from JPMorgan, which rose 2%, with strict cost control helping and return on equity holding at a steady 9%.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5697c694e4b01b84906dcd9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-14T16:03:06.066Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A rebound in oil prices is helping markets recover some of their early losses.

      "bodyText": "Tesco has impressed investors with much better than expected sales over Christmas after it cut prices and boosted customer service by putting thousands more staff in stores. Shares in Britain\u2019s biggest retailer rose 6% to 168p as it revealed a 1.3% rise in sales at established UK stores in the six key Christmas and new year shopping weeks. Analysts had been expecting a grim trading update \u2013 with sales down by up to 3% until industry data released this week indicated Tesco had turned things around in December. The chief executive, Dave Lewis, who joined Tesco in 2014 to lead a revival of the supermarket after a dramatic slide in sales and profits, said the group had sold more items to more shoppers after it reduced prices on an improved range of products and stepped up its customer service. \u201cThese results show another step in the right direction. We were more competitive than last year,\u201d Lewis said. But he added: \u201cWe are obviously pleased with the performance over Christmas but I don\u2019t think it takes away from conditions that make the market extremely challenging. We recognise there is progress but we continue to see more to do.\u201d Tesco had simultaneously released a trading update for a longer period \u2013 the three months to 28 November \u2013 and it showed sales at established UK stores down 1.5%. But that was still well ahead of expectations and Lewis said that during the previous year Tesco had been issuing a lot of discount vouchers. This Christmas Tesco issued a quarter less discount vouchers than 12 months earlier and Lewis said the grocer had moved away from voucher promotions to lower basic prices. He is expecting food price deflation, which stood at between -1.7% and -2.4% over the quarter, to continue for at least the next year. Lewis said Tesco had cut its own prices by between 2%-2.5% over that period. Over Christmas, Lewis said Tesco had reduced the price of seasonal goods such as turkey, stuffing, vegetables, mince pies and Christmas puddings by an average 5%. Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons also reported better than expected trading over Christmas, in a sign that Britain\u2019s big supermarkets are finally fighting back against the rapidly expanding German discounters. Some analysts estimate that sales at established Aldi stores rose by less than 1% in December as it made its lowest gain in Christmas market share since 2012. But Lewis insisted it was too early to suggest that the traditional chains had Aldi and Lidl on the back foot. Sainsbury\u2019s festive sales were still lower than the previous year, falling by 0.4%, but that was well ahead of City forecasts for a fall of 0.7%. Morrisons reported a surprise rise in sales of 0.2%, its first increase in four years. Tesco said it expected to meet profit expectations as its performance over Christmas was boosted by better availability of products on the shelf and more on-time home deliveries. \u201cThe improvement in the operations is not visible to everybody but we have spent a huge amount of time redesigning the organisation. There has been a fundamental shift in the way we run Tesco, notably in the UK but also in central Europe and Asia,\u201d said Lewis. Lewis said a range of changes had helped Tesco\u2019s largest supermarkets \u2013 the Extra stores \u2013 to achieve sales growth over Christmas after several years of decline. In the three months to 28 November, however, sales were still down in the largest stores, which have been hit by the rapidly rising popularity of small neighbourhood stores and online shopping. Lewis said it was unclear if they had really turned the corner. But he said: \u201cThis idea that big stores are a weight around our neck or some sad dinosaurs clearly hasn\u2019t been the case. As we have improved the offer \u2026 people have seen they can get everything they need under one roof and that is the most convenient form of shopping.\u201d The retailer\u2019s Tesco Express convenience stores also performed well, with sales up 3.5% at established stores. Analysts were impressed by Tesco\u2019s Christmas trading figures, with Phil Dorrell of consultants Retail Remedy describing them as \u201cextraordinary\u201d. He said Tesco\u2019s performance over the festive period was \u201call the more remarkable\u201d as its underlying sales were down by 1.5% in the third quarter. Tesco also saw a pick-up in performance overseas, with sales at established stores up 4.1% over the six-week Christmas period compared with a 2.9% rise in the previous quarter. Sales at established Irish stores, where Tesco faces even greater competition from Aldi and Lidl, rose 2.9%. James Anstead, an analyst at Tesco\u2019s in-house broker Barclays, said: \u201cWe think that this trading performance should impress the market.\u201d He added: \u201cAlthough the UK market continues to face a number of significant challenges \u2013 not least the growth of discounters and deflation \u2013 today\u2019s statement supports us in our more positive outlook on this name.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has kept interest rates on hold this month, noting volatility in global markets and highlighting a sharp fall in oil prices that is likely to keep inflation low. Members of the Bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) voted eight to one to leave rates at 0.5%, where they have been since March 2009, in a repeat of recent votes. Sticking to his recent stance, only Ian McCafferty voted for a rise to 0.75%. Minutes from the policy-setting meeting showed the MPC believed \u201cthe outlook was similar to how it had appeared\u201d when the Bank\u2019s latest economic forecasts were published in November. But the minutes also noted volatility on financial markets, and in share prices in particular, \u201cthat appeared linked to concerns about the underlying strength of the Chinese economy\u201d. \u201cRecent volatility in financial markets has underlined the downside risks to global growth, primarily emanating from emerging markets,\u201d the minutes said. The MPC highlighted a 40% fall in the oil price since November, which implied the increase in inflation that policymakers had been expecting around the turn of the year \u201cwould probably be a little more modest than previously assumed\u201d. The Bank said cheaper oil would \u201cdepress global inflation in the near term\u201d but would also provide some support to spending in the UK and its big trading partners. Oil prices have slumped on the back of a supply glut and waning demand as the global economy slows. On Wednesday, Brent crude dipped below $30 a barrel for the first time in nearly 12 years. World stock markets have also had a tumultuous start to 2016, falling as fears intensify over the economic outlook. Several analysts have warned in recent days that the global economy could suffer a repeat of the 2008 crash if the knock-on effects of a contraction in Chinese output pushes down commodity prices further and prompts panic selling on stock and bond markets. Those concerns, cheaper oil and signs of a slowdown in the UK economy, including news this week of a broad-based downturn in Britain\u2019s industrial sector, have prompted traders to push back their expectations for an interest rate rise. Most economists do not expect a move till the second half of this year or later. Some say uncertainty about the outcome of a planned referendum on the UK\u2019s EU membership, to take place this year or next, may also stay the Bank\u2019s hand. Commenting after the Bank decision, the Royal London Asset Management economist Ian Kernohan said: \u201cThe recent decline in the oil price will have played a part in the MPC\u2019s thinking, not so much because they see it as a signal of poor global growth prospects, but because it will keep inflation lower in 2016 than they would have expected a few months ago. \u201cThere will be no interest rate hike ahead of the Brexit referendum, however, given the uncertainties which the vote is already creating.\u201d The minutes from the Bank meeting said UK economic growth around the turn of the year would probably turn out to be a little weaker than the MPC had predicted in November when it released the quarterly inflation report forecasts. The Bank will update those forecasts in early February and should provide more details on how it views global growth prospects, cheaper oil and the domestic labour market affecting inflation. The Investec economist Chris Hare said: \u201cThe MPC held back on revealing too many bottom lines on how its thinking is evolving \u2013 a more conclusive steer should be revealed at the next inflation report on 4 February.\u201d Investec has shifted its forecast for a rate rise from the second quarter of this year to the final quarter. Similar to December\u2019s meeting, policymakers noted a slowdown in wage growth and the committee said it had discussed how labour costs might be affected by the slightly weaker economic outlook painted by recent indicators. The committee also commented on the relatively calm market reaction to the decision by the US Federal Reserve in December to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. The MPC noted that the US rate rise had been met with a positive reaction in US equity markets and a muted immediate reaction in other financial markets.",

Primark\u2019s difficulties reflect the problems faced by several other big clothing retailers last month, as shoppers left knitwear, coats and winter boots on the shelves during the warmest December on record. Flooding and rain in parts of the country, a reluctance to spend time in town centres in the wake of November\u2019s incidents in Paris, and the growing convenience and popularity of shopping online also kept people away from the high street. Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s sales of clothing and homeware at established stores plunged by 5.8% during the past three months, while Next lowered its profits guidance for the full year. Sales at Debenhams, meanwhile, rose as it stocked fewer coats and sold more perfume and beauty products, increasing online sales by 12%. Primark does not sell its clothes online and so is reliant on its stores. John Bason, finance director of Primark\u2019s parent company, Associated British Foods, said the number of shoppers visiting the clothing chain had not fallen but knitwear, coats and thermals had not sold well. \u201cChristmas was a tough one and we can really point to the weather,\u201d he said, adding that sales had been strong since the beginning of January as the weather had turned colder. He said that Primark, which ended an experiment with online selling because it found it could not do so profitably, was not considering a change of heart. Sales at the chain\u2019s established stores across Europe were flat in the 16 weeks to 2 January, compared with the same period a year before, with growth in Spain and France and a better performance in Germany and Holland offset by a decline in the UK. Analysts had expected growth of 2%. Bason said there would be further expansion overseas: \u201cThere is a huge market in continental Europe that we are going after and we know when we go to new locations we are greeted with wide acclaim. That\u2019s saying this model we\u2019ve got has great sustainable growth for the forseeable future,\u201d he said. Primark plans to open its second store in Italy by summer 2017 and is also expanding in the US, where it now has two stores open and plans to open 10. Bason said the third store was set to open the Danbury Fair mall in Connecticut in a few months\u2019 time and the ninth site, at the American Dream shopping mall in New Jersey, had now been signed for. The company said that sales had been strong in the first seven weeks of the period but had become weaker as a result of \u201cwarmer and wetter weather across Europe leading up to and over the Christmas period\u201d. Profit margins for the chain also fell as the weaker value of the pound against the dollar hit its buying power as it largely buys its stock in the US currency. ABF said the fall in margins at its clothing chain was lower than it had envisaged, as it had managed its stocks well and held back on discounting. However, the group said it continued to expect a \u201cmodest decline\u201d in profits for the year.",

So the FTSE 100 has fallen 101.23 points or 1.7% at 5859.74, on course for a new five year low. Amid a plethora of trading updates from retailers, Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct International is also in the spotlight, as a major investor changed tack and bought more shares.

It bought 2m shares on 12 January to take its stake to 3.61%, giving it a total holding of 5.05% when other financial instruments totalling 1.44% are taken into account. Even so, in the wake of Sports Direct taking a stake in US retailer Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods on Wednesday, its shares are down another 4.4p at 423.4p. A positive performance from rival JD Sports Fashion, up 47p at \u00a311.05, has also dented sentiment towards Sports Direct, which seems to have performed poorly in comparison. Elsewhere Tesco, up 7.7p at 166p, and Burberry, 21p better at \u00a311.33, have benefited from well-received trading updates.

      "bodyText": "Booming sales of trainers have delivered a bumper Christmas for JD Sports Fashion, which said it would beat City forecasts for annual profits. JD\u2019s performance is in stark contrast with bigger rival Sports Direct, founded by billionaire Mike Ashley, which warned on profits last week, blaming the mild winter and tough trade on the high street for worse-than-expected sales. News of JD\u2019s hefty profit upgrade prompted analysts to raise their target price on the stock. The shares leapt as much as 8% to an all-time high of \u00a311.40. Like-for-like sales at its UK and European stores rose 10.6% over the Christmas period. The retailer is confident of beating market expectations for annual profit before tax and one-off items of \u00a3136m by up to 10%. The Investec analyst Kate Calvert talked of a \u201cchampion\u2019s performance\u201d. \u201cJD appears to be in a sweet spot as several years of store and infrastructure investment is starting to bear fruit. We believe there is more to come, seeing an exciting European roll-out opportunity and attractive UK growth prospects,\u201d she said. Most of JD\u2019s 850 shops are in the UK, but it has been opening more stores in the Netherlands, Spain, France and Germany. There has been strong demand at JD for trainers made by Nike and other leading brands, as well as for women\u2019s sportswear, which pushed first-half profits up 80% to a record \u00a346.6m. The retailer has nurtured close links with Adidas and Nike, allowing access to the latest ranges that have made it popular with younger customers. JD also stocks brands such as Giorgio Armani\u2019s EA7 range, which rivals do not. Rebecca Marks, of retail consultants Conlumino, injected a note of caution: \u201cEven JD\u2019s resilience to competition may not be able to deflect the ongoing impact of currency issues as it looks to increase its European store numbers, and continues to faces challenges with its outdoor arm.\u201d JD is trying to turn around its loss-making outdoorswear business, which trades under the Millets, Blacks and Ultimate Outdoors brands.",

      "bodyText": "A catastrophe caused by climate change is seen as the biggest potential threat to the global economy in 2016, according to a survey of 750 experts conducted by the World Economic Forum. The annual assessment of risks conducted by the WEF before its annual meeting in Davos on 20-23 January showed that global warming had catapulted its way to the top of the list of concerns. A failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation was seen as likely to have a bigger impact than the spread of weapons of mass destruction, water crises, mass involuntary migration and a severe energy price shock \u2013 the first time in the 11 years of the Global Risks report that the environment has been in first place. The report, prepared by the WEF in collaboration with risk specialists Marsh &amp; McLennan and Zurich Insurance Group, comes a month after the deal signed in Paris to reduce carbon emissions. The WEF said evidence was mounting that inter-connections between risks were becoming stronger. It cited links between climate change and involuntary migration or international security, noting that these often had \u201cmajor and unpredictable impacts\u201d. Espen Barth Eide, the WEF\u2019s head of geopolitical affairs, said there was a risk of Europe fragmenting as a result of \u201cpeople on the move\u201d. Speaking at a press conference in London to launch the report, Eide said: \u201cI am concerned about the continued support in national politics for keeping Europe together.\u201d Eide added that if enough countries decided to pursue a non-integrated approach to coping with migration it would have \u201cprofound effects on Europe\u2019s politics and its economy\u201d, and would have a knock-on impact on the rest of the world. \u201cIf things unravel at the core, what does it mean in other parts of the world?\u201d Cecilia Reyes, Zurich\u2019s chief risk officer, said: \u201cClimate change is exacerbating more risks than ever before in terms of water crises, food shortages, constrained economic growth, weaker societal cohesion and increased security risks. \u201cMeanwhile, geopolitical instability is exposing businesses to cancelled projects, revoked licences, interrupted production, damaged assets and restricted movement of funds across borders. These political conflicts are in turn making the challenge of climate change all the more insurmountable \u2013 reducing the potential for political cooperation, as well as diverting resource, innovation and time away from climate change resilience and prevention.\u201d The WEF said the broad range of risks \u2013 from environmental to geopolitical and economic \u2013 was unprecedented. It added that risks appeared to be rising, with global average surface temperatures increasing by more than 1C over pre-industrial levels for the first time, and the number of forcibly displaced people at 59.5 million \u2013 almost 50% more than in 1940, when the second world war was being fought. \u201cData from the report appears to support the increased likelihood of risks across the board, with all 24 of the risks continuously measured since 2014 having increased their likelihood scores in the past three years,\u201d the WEF said. When asked which risk was most likely to materialise in 2016, respondents chose large-scale involuntary migration. This follows last year\u2019s refugee crisis, in which hundreds of thousands of people arrived in Europe fleeing conflicts in the Middle East and north Africa. This was followed by extreme weather events, climate change, interstate conflict with regional consequences, and major natural catastrophes. \u201cEvents such as Europe\u2019s refugee crisis and terrorist attacks have raised global political instability to its highest level since the cold war,\u201d said John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk and Specialties. \u201cThis is widening the backdrop of uncertainty against which international firms will increasingly be forced to make their strategic decisions. The need for business leaders to consider the implications of these risks on their firm\u2019s footprint, reputation and supply chain has never been more pressing.\u201d Drzik said at the press conference: \u201cMost risks are rising. It\u2019s a riskier world right now.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s pretty easy to find negative things to say about the economy, but in the past year, contrary to expectations, employment has held up well. The latest job vacancy figures released on Wednesday by the ABS showed that the fight to get a job is now the easiest since the start of 2013. But the figures also show that the battle for jobs is quite varied across the nation, with things getting hard in the west and easier in the east. Employment growth was pretty much the only big win Joe Hockey could point to in his time as treasurer. While the unemployment rate did rise from 5.7% to a peak of 6.2%, much of the rise was due to an increase in participation. The actual growth of employment continued to improve through 2014 and 2015. And while many (including me) have found the employment figures a bit too good to be true at times, they continued to largely hold up, and so too have the job vacancy figures. In November last year, there were 167,000 job vacancies (trend terms) \u2013 the most since August 2012. The number of vacancies grew by 11.6% in the past year \u2013 the strongest annual growth since February 2011: But looking at the number of job vacancies alone doesn\u2019t tell the full story \u2013 though as a general rule more vacancies is better. Economists look at the job vacancy rate, which is the number of vacancies as a percentage of people in the labour force. They also look at the number of unemployed per vacancy. In effect, these two measures give an indication of the number of vacancies relative to the size of the workforce and also how hard it is to get a job. On both of these measures, the employment market is as good as it has been since February 2013: The job vacancy rate of 1.32% has been improving for two years, and there are now across the country on average 4.5 unemployed for every job vacancy \u2013 significantly better than the 5.2 per vacancy 12 months ago. Economists also like to compare the job vacancy rates with the unemployment rate to arrive at what is known as the Beveridge Curve. Over the past 20 years, a job vacancy rate of 1.32 would on average mean there should be a lower unemployment rate \u2013 somewhere around 5.5% rather than the current 6.0%. But we shouldn\u2019t get too excited about this. The relationship between the two figures is never perfect, but it is worth keeping an eye on. If the unemployment rate remains higher than would be expected given the number of vacancies, it may be a sign that the employment market is not working as effectively as it should. It also could mean that there is a mismatch between the types of jobs available and the people looking for work. One issue is that these job vacancy and unemployed per vacancy figures are averages across the nation. A look at the state breakdowns shows little similarity: Vacancies are growing solidly in NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, but Western Australian job vacancies have been declining now for over two years. The picture of the changing nature of the economy is seen in the comparison of unemployed per vacancy in NSW, Victoria and WA over the past six years since the GFC: In May 2012 there were an astonishingly low 1.55 unemployed per job vacancy in WA; now it is 5.3 \u2013 a number greater than in both NSW and Victoria. Across the nation, the ACT and NT are the easiest places to get work, with NSW\u2019s 3.8 unemployed per vacancy the best of the states: While the job vacancies in South Australia have been growing solidly, it is now the toughest place to get work, with on average 7.1 unemployed fighting for each job vacancy \u2013 worse than the 6.9 in Tasmania. It\u2019s also worth noting that the largest number of job vacancies does not always align with the largest sectors of employment. There are almost always more vacancies in the administration and support industry than in all others except for the retail industry, despite the industry only accounting for around 3.5% of all employment: The education sector is the toughest sector with respect to vacancies compared to actual employment. Unfortunately the job vacancy figures do not distinguish between full-time and part-time and casual positions. Thus while it may seem that the administration and support industry is the way to go to get a job, these figures tell us nothing about the type of employment and wages such vacancies are offering. But even with these caveats the figures do suggest the employment situation is much improved on where it was a year ago. The figures also suggest the Turnbull government has quickly reversed the Abbott/Hockey cuts to the public service. The job vacancies for public sector jobs in the ACT is a good proxy for the federal public service, and the 1,600 such vacancies in November last year was the most since November 2011, and well up on the record low 200 in August 2014: While the figures are overall quite positive, they are now referring to the situation two to three months ago. Given the gloom around at the moment the question whether these figures are just a nice remembrance of things past, or it they are a sign of solidly growing employment that will continue into 2016.",

They also look at the number of unemployed per vacancy. </p> <p>In effect, these two measures give an indication of the number of vacancies relative to the size of the workforce and also how hard it is to get a job.</p> <p>On both of these measures, the employment market is as good as it has been since February 2013:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Job vacancy rates - Australia (trend)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9Re4G/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The job vacancy rate of 1.32% has been improving for two years, and there are now across the country on average 4.5 unemployed for every job vacancy \u2013 significantly better than the 5.2 per vacancy 12 months ago. </p> <p>Economists also like to compare the job vacancy rates with the unemployment rate to arrive at what is known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beveridge_curve\">Beveridge Curve</a>. </p> <p>Over the past 20 years, a job vacancy rate of 1.32 would on average mean there should be a lower unemployment rate \u2013 somewhere around 5.5% rather than the current 6.0%. </p> <p>But we shouldn\u2019t get too excited about this. The relationship between the two figures is never perfect, but it is worth keeping an eye on. If the unemployment rate remains higher than would be expected given the number of vacancies, it may be a sign that the employment market is not working as effectively as it should. It also could mean that there is a mismatch between the types of jobs available and the people looking for work.</p> <p>One issue is that these job vacancy and unemployed per vacancy figures are averages across the nation. A look at the state breakdowns shows little similarity:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of job vacancies by state.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1Rqvu/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Vacancies are growing solidly in NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, but Western Australian job vacancies have been declining now for over two years.</p> <p>The picture of the changing nature of the economy is seen in the comparison of unemployed per vacancy in NSW, Victoria and WA over the past six years since the GFC:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployed per job vacancy.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7dJgd/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In May 2012 there were an astonishingly low 1.55 unemployed per job vacancy in WA; now it is 5.3 \u2013 a number greater than in both NSW and Victoria.</p> <p>Across the nation, the ACT and NT are the easiest places to get work, with NSW\u2019s 3.8 unemployed per vacancy the best of the states:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployed per job vacancy by state.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zWpT3/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>While the job vacancies in South Australia have been growing solidly, it is now the toughest place to get work, with on average 7.1 unemployed fighting for each job vacancy \u2013 worse than the 6.9 in Tasmania.</p> <p>It\u2019s also worth noting that the largest number of job vacancies does not always align with the largest sectors of employment. There are almost always more vacancies in the administration and support industry than in all others except for the retail industry, despite the industry only accounting for around 3.5% of all employment:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Job vacancies and employment by industry.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ewV7P/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The education sector is the toughest sector with respect to vacancies compared to actual employment.&#xa0;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jan/11/deja-vu-for-australian-economy-as-china-woes-portend-another-bad-year\">Deja vu for Australian economy as China woes portend another bad year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unfortunately the job vacancy figures do not distinguish between full-time and part-time and casual positions. Thus while it may seem that the administration and support industry is the way to go to get a job, these figures tell us nothing about the type of employment and wages such vacancies are offering.&#xa0;</p> <p>But even with these caveats the figures do suggest the employment situation is much improved on where it was a year ago.&#xa0;</p> <p>The figures also suggest the Turnbull government has quickly reversed the Abbott/Hockey cuts to the public service.&#xa0;</p> <p>The job vacancies for public sector jobs in the ACT is a good proxy for the federal public service, and the 1,600 such vacancies in November last year was the most since November 2011, and well up on the record low 200 in August 2014:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Public sector job vacancies - ACT.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6Xuod/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While the figures are overall quite positive, they are now referring to the situation two to three months ago.

      "bodyText": "A shortage of skilled workers in the construction industry pushed up wages in the sector in 2015 and could threaten some of the government\u2019s biggest housing and infrastructure programmes, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) has said. Bricklayers and quantity surveyors were in particularly short supply, with six in 10 Rics survey respondents having difficulty finding them for projects. Construction wages increased by more than 6% in the year to October, three times the average wage rise for UK workers, Rics said on Thursday. The organisation\u2019s latest construction market survey, covering the last three months of 2015, found labour shortages were considered the biggest barrier to growth by 66% of industry professionals. The government has repeatedly pledged to act to boost housebuilding to tackle the UK\u2019s housing crisis, with the latest announcement of plans to create 13,000 homes in southern England made just last week. However, while the number of houses being built has recovered from a low hit after the financial crisis, they remain below their 2007 peak, and well short of hitting the target of 250,000 new homes a year many experts say are needed to keep up with demand. Research by the Guardian found that major firms had land for more than 600,000 homes which had not been built, while the Local Government Association recently said the number of unbuilt properties with planning permission had reached a record high. On Wednesday the chief executive of the UK\u2019s biggest housebuilder described the skills shortage as \u201cthe number one challenge for housebuilders\u201d. David Thomas of Barratt Developments said: \u201cAt any given point in time we are employing about 16,000 subcontractors.\u201d Rics said the building industry had lost skilled workers during the downturn, and had not been attracting new trainees and recruits. Some of the workers who had stayed on while business contracted were also reaching a stage where they wanted to retire. It called on the government to create a strategy to encourage people into the sector, including making it easier for younger people to find out about, and get training for, different roles. The chief economist at Rics, Simon Rubinsohn, said: \u201cWhile workloads are still growing at a relatively healthy pace, labour shortages in the construction sector are causing delays at different stages in the development process and leading to significant problems with project planning. More than 60% of our survey respondents said that these resulting planning delays were an impediment to growth. \u201cThat said, industry wages are becoming increasingly attractive, and I would hope that over time this will encourage skilled workers to return to the sector, as well as drawing school leavers and graduates towards construction-industry careers.\u201d Rics also reported a \u00a3274m fall in net lending to the sector in the three months to November and said 64% of those surveyed had \u201chighlighted continuing issues around financial constraints\u201d. However, despite these concerns, 45% said they expected profit margins to rise this year. In September, the Adzuna website said construction workers were among the workers experiencing the biggest growth in earnings, with an average salary of \u00a338,159. Some bricklayers are thought to be commanding more than \u00a3200 a day.",
