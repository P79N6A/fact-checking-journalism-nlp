      "bodyText": "Total debt While the government plans to cut its annual deficit year on year until 2025, Britain\u2019s households are going in the opposite direction. Figures for household debt show that since 2012 households have added to their debt mountain and the trajectory puts the ratio of household debt to GDP heading back towards the peak seen in the boom years before the financial crash. In March 2012, total household debt stood at \u00a31,518.5bn in today\u2019s prices compared with \u00a31,630.1bn in March 2017. So in the past five years household debt has increased by an inflation-adjusted rate of 7.3%. It is not a surprise to many analysts that with wages growth adjusted for inflation (and excluding bonuses) crawling ahead by just 0.7% over the same five-year period, consumers are turning to credit to buy essential items. Ultra-low interest rates may have kept the cost of mortgage loans lower than expected by the government\u2019s official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. But there are concerns that borrowing on loans, credit cards, overdrafts and second mortgages has rocketed. Making matters worse, many households have doubled up on their debts by getting into arrears on their monthly bills, especially council tax. Unsecured credit In 2007 unsecured consumer debt \u2013 mainly on credit cards, store cards, loans and overdrafts \u2013 peaked at 45% of household income. In the years immediately following the financial crash, households were more inclined to kick their credit habit. Saving increased and borrowing declined, as the level of unsecured debt fell to 35% of income by 2012. But since 2012 households have increasingly failed to clear their credit and store card bills at the end of the month. High interest rates on those cards had sent their debts rocketing and the OBR now predicts unsecured household debt will reach 47% of income by 2021. Bank of England figures show unsecured consumer credit jumped 4.9% in the past year when adjusted for inflation. The total increased from \u00a3192bn (in today\u2019s money) in July 2016 to \u00a3201.5bn in July 2017. This marks a slowdown on the previous two years when growth hit 12% and inflation was almost non-existent, but maintains the trend for UK GDP growth to come almost entirely from an increasing population and consumer spending with borrowed money. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. The government\u2019s official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, once predicted that the UK\u2019s economic revival would be built on the foundations of business investment, higher exports and an improvement in productivity that would lead to higher wages. It didn\u2019t materialise. Instead a mix of low wages growth, government cutbacks on welfare and public services, and more recently the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote have forced millions of households to borrow to buy essentials. Car finance Loans linked to car purchases have rocketed in recent years driven by loans in the form of personal contract plans (PCPs). These plans cover the depreciation on a car over three to five years, making them cheap to finance on a monthly basis. Deposits can also be as low as a few hundred pounds. As a result PCPs have grabbed 86% of the new car market, which means more than 1m cars a year are bought with this new style of finance. Another measure of its success is the rise of auto-finance from dealerships - when the funds are provided by car makers - which has more than doubled in the past five years from \u00a314.6bn in 2011, in today\u2019s money, to \u00a331.7bn in new credit issued in 2016. But the industry does not produce figures for the level of total debt on PCP loans. It also fails to publish the level of sub-prime lending to the poorest households. The lack of transparency about the scale of lending in recent years and how much was directed at people who might not be able to keep up their payments in a downturn, has fuelled fears that the rapid growth in specialist car loans is a repeat of the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal. PPI was a previously niche product that was widely adopted by the finance industry before leading to a wave of compensation claims from customers. The industry says lending to people with poor credit histories is low and the credit is offered against an asset - the car - which can be repossessed in the event the owner cannot pay, protecting the lender from defaults. Mortgages The government helped to revive the mortgage market after the banking crash with its Help to Buy scheme, which subsidised the deposits of first time buyers. It also backed a Bank of England project to support lenders offering cut-price mortgage rates to buyers and re-mortgagers. Critics of the schemes believe they have encouraged thousands of people who could not afford a mortgage under more normal conditions to take on huge debts. More than 40% of mortgage borrowers have never experienced an increase in interest rates and the fear is that many in this group would be unable to cope. Some might only be able to make repayments with dramatic cutbacks in other spending, but this has knock-on effects for the economy. Others might face repossession or need forebearance by their lender, increasing the lender\u2019s liabilities. A rise in the Bank of England\u2019s 0.25% base rate is now possible before the end of the year after one of Threadneedle Street\u2019s policymakers who is renowned for wanting to keep rates low, Gertjan Vlieghe, said he felt the time was nearing for a hike. Many economists believe the first rate hike could come in November. Students Student debt has soared in recent years following sweeping changes to the way universities are funded. Until 2013, the majority of university funds came from central government. A hike in fees to \u00a39,000 and then \u00a39,250 this year, has shifted the burden to students, who borrow from the Student Loan Company (SLC). The most recent figures to the end of March show outstanding debt on loans jumped by 16.6% to \u00a3100.5bn, up from \u00a386.2bn a year earlier. The government expects to write off around 40% of the total, though critics of the scheme expect that figure to rise to 60%. Low wages growth over the next couple of decades, rising taxes to cope with an ageing population and the shift to insecure working practices and the gig economy are likely to make it more difficult for graduates to repay their loans in full. Arrears Council tax arrears have increased 12% in the past five years. Data from the water industry shows that the total level of unpaid bills increased from \u00a31.9bn to \u00a32.2bn in the four years between 2010-11 and 2014-15 (in 2014-15 prices). This is an increase of about 17% over four years. Outstanding debt on electricity and gas bills added another \u00a31.24bn to the arrears total in 2016-17. But there is little clear data to show the extent of rent arrears and arrears on other household essentials, such as broadband services and mobile phone contracts. Citizens Advice said its greatest concern was the rapid rise in arrears as households struggle to maintain payments for basic services. The debt advice charity said many families are unable to make ends meet and arrears were a reflection of this dire situation as much as consumer finance debts. Councils and other government agencies have gained a reputation for taking a harder line with arrears than high street banks, which are more likely to agree a debt management plan to repay debts. they will often write-off at least some of the debt. Councils, though, will employ debt collectors at an earlier stage, racking up bailiff bills and legal costs, which are then added to the arrears. UK: the international perspective A country\u2019s debts have four elements - household debt, corporate debt, government debt and the trade balance, if it is in deficit. The US and the UK are the two G7 countries that have fuelled GDP growth with increasing amounts of consumer debt in recent years. The UK also runs a large trade deficit and operates with a shortfall in government spending. Corporations, on the other hand, have hoarded cash and as a group have the healthiest balance sheets in modern times. Continental European countries have been more circumspect in allowing household debt to increase. Banks in Germany and France have been more reluctant to lend, though partly in response to their own failure to deal with bad debts left overhanging from the 2008 crash. Just to give the full comparison with the UK, Germany has a large trade surplus, a government budget surplus and a bouyant corporate sector with relatively few borrowings Canada has a particular problem with household debts relative to disposable incomes after a property boom that has pushed house prices to record levels. The UK\u2019s trade deficit, which is the largest in the G7, shows that not only are consumers spending more than they earn each year, they are spending it on imports and borrowing from foreigners. In Japan the high level of household debt illustrates a more general reluctance among the population to put up with meagre wage growth. The growth in Japanese consumer spending is higher than wages growth and tax receipts are lower than government spending, leaving household and government debt to rise. This year Japan\u2019s public sector debt to GDP ratio is expected to breach the 250% mark, compared to the UK\u2019s 89% and Germany\u2019s 68%. Japan survives by virtue of its huge trade surplus, which its declining population must work increasingly hard to maintain.",

    "webTitle": "Why is Ryanair cancelling flights and what can you do?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair\u2019s decision to cancel 40-55 flights a day for the next six weeks will leave as many as 400,000 passengers with their holidays and travel plans ruined. Why is Ryanair doing this? The official line from Ryanair\u2019s Facebook page is that \u201cWe have messed up in the planning of pilot holidays and we\u2019re working hard to fix that.\u201d Ryanair has also fallen victim to pilots defecting to Norwegian, which has taken 140 staff from its Irish rival this year already. Of the 4,500 comments on Ryanair\u2019s Facebook page on Monday morning, the most popular was: \u201cPublish all cancelled flights now for the next six weeks so we can make alternative arrangements and stop treating your customers like idiots.\u201d Ryanair\u2019s share price fell significantly \u2013 by about 3% \u2013 on Monday morning, knocking about \u00a3500m off its stock market valuation. Is my flight cancelled? Ryanair was informing customers at short notice about cancellations. But now it has published a full list of cancellations on its website and anyone with a reservation for a cancelled flight will be informed by email. Ryanair has told passengers: \u201cYour flight is operating as scheduled unless you have received a cancellation email.\u201d My flight has been cancelled. I need to get to my destination. What do I do? EU rules state: \u201cYou have the right to be rerouted to your final destination shown on your ticket at the earliest opportunity under comparable transport conditions or rebooking at a later date if that is more convenient for you.\u201d The trouble is, the meaning of \u201cearliest opportunity\u201d has not been tested in courts. If Ryanair is able to put you on another of its flights later in the day to the same destination, it is almost certainly fulfilling its obligations. But if, say, you are heading to Barcelona for a long weekend on Friday, and it says it won\u2019t get you on a flight until Sunday, then it is likely to be breaching the EU rules. Michael O\u2019Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, said on Monday the company would not book passengers on to rival airlines to get them to their destination on time. If Ryanair refuses to re-route you when seats are available on, say, BA or easyJet, then you can purchase a ticket yourself and send the receipt to Ryanair and request a refund. But there is no guarantee Ryanair will pay. EasyJet, for example, argues that if it can fly you to your destination within 48 hours, then it will not allow a switch to a rival airline. I\u2019ve been cancelled and that\u2019s it \u2013 I\u2019ve not been offered a re-routing If that is the case, then Ryanair is in breach of EU rules, and you are entitled to be reimbursed for the cost of buying another flight. As the EU website states: \u201cIf the air carrier does not offer you the choice between reimbursement and re-routing, but decides unilaterally to reimburse your original ticket, you are entitled to an additional reimbursement of the price difference with the new ticket (under comparable transport conditions).\u201d What compensation must Ryanair pay? The general rule is that an airline must refund the cost of the ticket plus pay \u20ac250 (\u00a3220) compensation for flights of up to 1,500km, and \u20ac400 (\u00a3353) for flights of 1,500km to 3,500km. Ryanair does not have any routes over 3,500km. However, if the flight is cancelled with more than two weeks\u2019 notice, then Ryanair does not have to pay the EU compensation, and is only obliged to return the cost of the ticket. If the flight is cancelled within seven to 14 days of the departure date, you are entitled to compensation unless Ryanair offers you re-routing that departs within two hours of the departure time. If travellers are informed of a cancellation within seven days, the wording of the EU legislation says the \u20ac250 or \u20ac400 must be paid \u201cunless they are offered re-routing, allowing them to depart no more than one hour before the scheduled time of departure and to reach their final destination less than two hours after the scheduled time of arrival\u201d. My return flight home has been cancelled. Will Ryanair pay for hotels? It certainly should. Airlines in the EU have to offer free meals and refreshments, plus a hotel in cases where a stay is necessary. But keep all receipts, and note that alcohol is not covered. The EU rules say: \u201cWhile waiting to continue your trip, you may have the right to meals and refreshments, access to communication, accommodation (if necessary) and transportation to and from the accommodation.\u201d My Airbnb is non-cancellable. Will Ryanair pay for that? No. You will have to seek compensation via your travel insurance. Airlines fight any attempt to pay \u201cconsequential\u201d losses for things such as hotel bookings and car hire. Lawyer Coby Benson of flight compensation specialists Bott &amp; Co said: \u201cIf the flight is cancelled, there is nothing a passenger can do to recover consequential losses. So you have to try your travel insurer instead.\u201d Can I cancel and rebook with another airline while Ryanair is dithering around? This would be a risky move. It\u2019s appalling that so many passengers are in the dark about their travel plans, but if you cancel now, and the Ryanair flight does go ahead, you will not receive any refunds or compensation. Twitter is littered with complaints from travellers devastated by the Ryanair cancellations under the #Ryanaircancellations. One bride-to-be posted about her wedding plans \u2013 with 30 flights booked for friends next week. Like thousands of others, she is furious that Ryanair has failed to publish a full list of cancelled flights. Can I take Ryanair to court for my losses? Good luck with that. While EU rules give passengers some compensation rights, they also allow Ryanair to domicile its business in Ireland and demand that any legal case go through the Irish courts. \u201cRyanair argues that the Irish courts have exclusive jurisdiction. We simply can\u2019t issue court proceedings against them in England,\u201d said Benson. Affected passengers could try the Irish small claims court, or the European small claims procedure. But the latter is extremely risky; if you lose, you will have to pay Ryanair\u2019s costs, which could be very large. However, Ryanair is signed up to the aviation alternative dispute resolution process in the UK, at aviationadr.org.uk. This settles claims for passengers who allege they have been treated unfairly.",

But now it has <a href=\"https://www.ryanair.com/gb/en/useful-info/help-centre/travel-updates/flight-cancellations7\">published a full list of cancellations</a> on its website and anyone with a reservation for a cancelled flight will be informed by email. </p> <p>Ryanair has told passengers: \u201cYour flight is operating as scheduled unless you have received a cancellation email.\u201d </p> <h2>My flight has been cancelled. I need to get to my destination. What do I do?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/dg_move_rights_campaign_typoposter_2009_a1_air_en.pdf\">EU rules</a> state: \u201cYou have the right to be rerouted to your final destination shown on your ticket at the earliest opportunity under comparable transport conditions or rebooking at a later date if that is more convenient for you.\u201d</p> <p>The trouble is, the meaning of \u201cearliest opportunity\u201d has not been tested in courts. If Ryanair is able to put you on another of its flights later in the day to the same destination, it is almost certainly fulfilling its obligations. But if, say, you are heading to Barcelona for a long weekend on Friday, and it says it won\u2019t get you on a flight until Sunday, then it is likely to be breaching the EU rules. </p> <p>Michael O\u2019Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, said on Monday the company would not book passengers on to rival airlines to get them to their destination on time. </p> <p>If Ryanair refuses to re-route you when seats are available on, say, BA or easyJet, then you can purchase a ticket yourself and send the receipt to Ryanair and request a refund. But there is no guarantee Ryanair will pay. EasyJet, for example, argues that if it can fly you to your destination within 48 hours, then it will not allow a switch to a rival airline. </p> <h2>I\u2019ve been cancelled and that\u2019s it \u2013 I\u2019ve not been offered a re-routing</h2> <p>If that is the case, then Ryanair is in breach of EU rules, and you are entitled to be reimbursed for the cost of buying another flight. As the <a href=\"http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm\">EU website states</a>: \u201cIf the air carrier does not offer you the choice between reimbursement and re-routing, but decides unilaterally to reimburse your original ticket, you are entitled to an additional reimbursement of the price difference with the new ticket (under comparable transport conditions).\u201d</p> <h2>What compensation must Ryanair pay?</h2> <p>The general rule is that an airline must refund the cost of the ticket plus pay \u20ac250 (\u00a3220) compensation for flights of up to 1,500km, and \u20ac400 (\u00a3353) for flights of 1,500km to 3,500km. Ryanair does not have any routes over 3,500km. </p> <p>However, if the flight is cancelled with more than two weeks\u2019 notice, then Ryanair does not have to pay the EU compensation, and is only obliged to return the cost of the ticket.<br></p> <p>If the flight is cancelled within seven to 14 days of the departure date, you are entitled to compensation unless Ryanair offers you re-routing that departs within two hours of the departure time. </p> <p>If travellers are informed of a cancellation within seven days, <a href=\"https://www.aviationreg.ie/_fileupload/Image/Regulation%20EC261%202004.pdf\">the wording of the EU legislation</a> says the \u20ac250 or \u20ac400 must be paid \u201cunless they are offered re-routing, allowing them to depart no more than one hour before the scheduled time of departure and to reach their final destination less than two hours after the scheduled time of arrival\u201d.</p> <h2>My return flight home has been cancelled.

    "webTitle": "Fall in migration after Brexit could push up inflation, says Carney", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A sharp fall in migrant workers coming to Britain as a consequence of Brexit could push up wages and cause a spike in inflation in the short term, according to the governor of the Bank of England. Mark Carney was setting out his view on inflation days after the Bank\u2019s rate-setting panel indicated it could raise interest rates for the first time in a decade. Carney said the rapid deceleration of migrant labour could lead to shortages for employers, pushing up wage growth and inflation in the short term. However, in the long term, higher levels of immigration did not push down wages or inflation, he said. In a speech in Washington, he said: \u201cAbrupt decreases in migration could result in shortages in some sectors that have become reliant on migrant labour, and contribute more materially to inflationary pressures.\u201d In the longer term, \u201cBrexit could therefore ultimately have only a modest impact on prices in general equilibrium\u201d. Carney\u2019s intervention is significant as it follows a period of intense political debate about the impact of EU migration on wages and employment in Britain, after a copy of the government\u2019s post-Brexit immigration blueprint was leaked to the Guardian earlier this month. Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, claimed Theresa May suppressed Home Office reports that found little evidence of immigration lowering UK wages. Although the governor argued there would be no long run impact on jobs and wages from Brexit discouraging EU workers, his speech is likely to be seized upon by Brexiters arguing for tighter immigration controls. But he also diffuses another argument \u2013 that Britain would be able to offset any loss of trade ties with the EU by striking new agreements with other countries, as it will take time for businesses to adapt to any new rules. The reduction and reorientation of trade is \u201clikely to weigh on productivity for some time\u201d, he said, while the actual impact will depend on how quickly any lost access to Europe is replaced by other arrangements. The governor also pointed to an increase in UK exports that only go to manufacturers in the EU, before being sold on to end buyers. This has the potential to limit Britain\u2019s ability to trade directly with other countries. \u201cThe UK doesn\u2019t so much export to Europe as through Europe; it is a supplier of components to final goods that are exported beyond the continent,\u201d he said. Carney\u2019s comments come after the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) issued a surprise warning it could raise interest rates as early as November. Speaking in support of that stance, he described Brexit as inflationary, while saying that the rate setting panel has a responsibility to curb such trends. On balance, he said inflation remains likely to overshoot the Bank\u2019s 2% target over the next three years, forcing the MPC\u2019s hand. Other central banks around the world are also seeking to raise interest rates, which means \u201cthe case for a modest monetary tightening is reinforced\u201d. Threadneedle Street has previously talked up the likelihood of a rate hike only to not follow through. But this time, there have been indications from Carney, as well as previously dovish MPC members such as Gertjan Vileghe, who was previously considered the Bank\u2019s strongest opponent of a rate hike. The pound, which surged to its highest level since the Brexit vote in June 2016 on Friday after Vileghe made the case for rate rises, slipped back 0.8% against the dollar on Monday after Carney signalled that any hikes would be gradual and limited. While there has been a slowdown in the number of EU workers coming to Britain and fears raised over labour shortages raised by business leaders, the numbers do not yet point to a sharp decline. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show the rate of increase in EU workers coming to Britain is slowing \u2013 although yet to retreat in absolute terms. There was however a 1.1% drop in the number of workers from eight of the EU\u2019s most recent eastern European member states, including Poland and the Czech Republic, to 997,000 in the three months to June from the same period a year ago.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair\u2019s shares fell 2.4% on Monday, which seems an overly gentle reaction to last Friday\u2019s late shocker that up to 2,000 flights will be cancelled over the next six weeks. The direct short-term impact on Ryanair\u2019s profits may be modest \u2013 the peak high-margin summer season is over \u2013 but the company\u2019s chaotic handling of events suggests the tale is far from over. The first problem is Ryanair\u2019s feeble explanation for the cancellations. The airline threw everything into the mix, from strikes by French air traffic controllers to thunderstorms, ignoring the fact that many are almost annual events. Analysts at RBC called the collection a list of \u201cfootball manager excuses\u201d. They\u2019re right. The obligation on airlines is to have sufficient slack in the system to cope. It was only when Ryanair marketing officer Kenny Jacobs conceded that \u201cwe have messed up in the planning of pilot holidays\u201d that one got close to an admission of fault. The pressures should not have led to a crisis. The fact that rival Norwegian claims to have hired 140 Ryanair pilots this year may have been a contributory factor. The second problem is that even the cancellation programme looks to be an on-the-hoof exercise. To say that you\u2019re cancelling 2% of flights over six weeks is one thing \u2013 but at least tell the customers immediately which planes won\u2019t be flying. A full list should appear overnight, but why cause alarm for the 98% who will be able to fly? Ryanair chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary used to have a phrase for such behaviour. He called it \u201cunnecessarily pissing people off\u201d and vowed to address matters under his \u201calways getting better\u201d programme. Any soft benefits of that self-improvement policy (and O\u2019Leary has claimed they are substantial) may now have evaporated. The third issue is that, even if the immediate financial damage is slight, it\u2019s hard to guess at the size of the real bill. RBC points out that compensation claims are unknown and \u201cwe have yet to see a robust explanation of how affected customers will be accommodated.\u201d Then there\u2019s the open question of whether Ryanair will be obliged to add overheads permanently to avoid a repetition. The City was already debating the cost implications of last week\u2019s \u201cMons ruling\u201d in which Ryanair lost its battle to force employees across Europe to take contractual disputes to the Irish courts. The company says the verdict won\u2019t cost it a single euro. Not everybody is convinced. In the very long run, one suspects O\u2019Leary will emerge smiling. He usually does, and Ryanair remains a formidable operation. Yet City\u2019s initial response feels too breezy. This is a punctuality crisis at Ryanair. When easyJet suffered its own timekeeping pressures in 2010 \u2013 it was called \u201cworse than Air Zimbabwe\u201d at the time \u2013 it took management about a year to restore order. Brexit fallback still no further forward Mark Carney\u2019s bleak assessment of the UK\u2019s post-Brexit economy is no less alarming for being exactly what you\u2019d expect him to say. More worrying \u2013 for being less expected \u2013 views have been expressed in recent weeks by Carney\u2019s predecessor, Lord King. King has usually sounded more cheerful about leaving the EU but he has been damning about the progress of negotiations. The UK needs a \u201ccredible fallback\u201d position \u201cotherwise those negotiating on the other side will not take any notice of what we would like to achieve,\u201d he told the BBC last month. As he said, both sides in the Brexit debate ought to be able to agree on that simple point, which is really just about how to negotiate. King still thought a credible fallback was a \u201cdoable proposition if we start now\u201d. Well, maybe, but it\u2019s hard to point to any progress since he spoke. Carney\u2019s speech, one fears, will merely provoke another pointless re-run of the referendum debate. Geoghegan\u2019s Rentokil career abruptly terminated \u201cOur integrated pest management solution helps you to take a zero tolerance approach to pests,\u201d says Rentokil Initial\u2019s website. There was also a certain ruthlessness about the announcement that non-executive director Chris Geoghegan has \u201cdecided to step down.\u201d There was no bland expression of thanks, or explanation of his departure after only 15 months. The reason is not hard to guess, of course. Geoghegan is the former BAE Systems executive who introduced Bell Pottinger to the controversial Gupta family. That meeting led to the horrible lobbying campaign that aimed to stir up racial tensions in South Africa. Rentokil has a big operation in the country, thus Geoghegan\u2019s continuing presence on the board was surely untenable. Did he jump or was he was pushed? It hardly matters.",

      "bodyText": "The government needs to step in to help tackle the mountain of debt being racked up by the most vulnerable consumers in Britain, the chief financial regulator has warned, as new data shows that personal debt burdens are continuing to rise. New figures seen by the Guardian showed the worsening consequences of Britain\u2019s borrowing binge. According to the Money Advice Service, there are now 8.3 million people in the UK with problem debts. The debt charity StepChange, which has also released fresh data, said the percentage of its clients falling behind on payments went over 40% in the first half of 2017, while the average debt of the people it helps has also risen, from \u00a314,251 in 2016 to \u00a314,367 in the first half of the year. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, told the Guardian \u2013 at the start of a series examining the \u00a3200bn in unsecured consumer credit amassed by households in Britain \u2013 that he was concerned about the sheer number of people who needs loans to make ends meet. He pinpointed gig economy workers, who do not have guaranteed hours, as in special need of credit to smoothe their incomes. StepChange highlighted young people and renters as increasingly vulnerable, with many needing to borrow to cover the most basic everyday bills. Bailey told the Guardian he had visited debt charities across the UK and that many people were facing difficulties with\u201cfrontline debt\u201d such as council tax and utility bill arrears. He said organisations extending that kind of credit were often faster to recoup their losses, which can involve bailiffs, court orders and repossessions, than traditional lenders. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a sustainable solution, in terms of the provision of credit where needed,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cNo one body might solve it on their own,\u201d added the FCA head, who has put the issue of consumer credit at the centre of the watchdog\u2019s agenda this year. Consumer credit, which covers personal loans, credit cards and borrowing for cars, is rising at just under 10% a year, at a time when wages are falling at 0.4% a year taking inflation into account. Some 86% of cars are now bought on PCP (personal contract purchase) credit deals, which effectively leave borrowers leasing their vehicle. Meanwhile, nearly half of all borrowers on credit cards are on zero interest rate offers. Bailey said people working in the gig economy with erratic incomes were in particular need of access to credit, especially those with rent-to-own deals used for buying household items like fridges and washing machines. \u201cThere is a really big question around how do you provide credit. There is a case for people [needing loans] having access to credit, particularly in a world where earnings are more erratic.\u201d Referring to the \u201cso-called gig economy\u201d, he added: \u201cCredit is a means of smoothing [erratic incomes] but the question is how do you structure it in a sustainable fashion,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cIt needs government involvement,\u201d said Bailey. The regulator has been collecting information about the diverse consumer credit market which spans credit cards, car loans and other forms of lending such as rent to own. With warnings from the Bank of England that interest rates could rise from their current record lows of 0.25% as early as November, there are concerns that heavily indebted consumers could start to run into difficulty on their loan payments. StepChange said it was concerned about a steep increase in the number of under-40s and renters who were struggling to make ends meet, adding to the trend for low-income families to rely on credit to buy essential items. Figures from its review of client visits and phone calls in the first six months of the year shows that households were also increasingly falling behind on payments for council tax, water rates and other household bills. StepChange said the average council tax arrears declared by its clients has risen from \u00a3756 in 2013 to \u00a31,012 this year. For electricity bills, arrears have risen from \u00a3521 to \u00a3668. The FCA\u2019s research shows that one in six people with debt on credit cards, personal lending and car loans \u2013 which amounts to 2.2 million people \u2013 are in financial distress. They are more likely to be younger, have children, be unemployed and less educated than others. The FCA has already cracked down on payday lenders \u2013 from 2015 capping the rate of interest they can charge \u2013 and also announced a series of measures intended to help credit card customers laden down with persistent debt. A review into the car loan market is under way. \u201cI don\u2019t think that (PCPs) are irrational at all,\u201d said Bailey, but the regulator is on alert for deals consumers do not understand, particularly regarding mileage limits and the condition of the car, which can result in unexpectedly large demands for payments at the end of the term. Bailey said he was also using the regulator\u2019s \u201cconvening\u201d powers to summon charities and other industry bodies to discuss the state of the rent-to-own market, but said the watchdog would not intervene in any way that would restrict this form of credit. . The credit card market has already been scrutinised, particularly in relation to zero-interest rate balance transfers - when credit card debt is rolled over onto a new card - which can provide free borrowing for up to 43 months. Some 45% of the \u00a365bn of credit card debt is on zero balance transfers and at the end of the interest-free period half the balances are at the same level as when the offer began.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s only just gone 9am at the Stratford Centre in east London, but the debt advice centre in the shopping mall is already full. Three miles from the gleaming towers of Canary Wharf in a former clothes shop, the borough of Newham\u2019s Moneyworks service helps residents struggling to make ends meet. Problems with high cost credit, payday lending and loan sharks are commonplace in this part of the capital. According to research from the Money Advice Service, residents of Newham \u2013 which stretches from the Olympic Park in the west to London City airport and the river in the south and almost to Barking in the east \u2013 are the most likely in the country to be overburdened with debt. It calculates that almost one in four people in the area \u2013 approximately 60,000 people in this borough alone \u2013 have problem debts. The issues are symptomatic of a growing problem with debt in Britain, as borrowing accelerates almost five times as fast as the growth in earnings. Personal debt levels, excluding student loans, now total more than \u00a3200bn, according to the Bank of England. Those levels have not been seen since before the financial crisis. Michael Bruce, a 68-year-old former demolition worker who used to blast concrete from the metal frames of condemned buildings along the banks of the Thames, got a cheap loan from the credit union linked to Moneyworks to fix flood damage at his home. Living on disability benefits, he couldn\u2019t get credit elsewhere and was facing exorbitant charges on products he bought from hire purchase firm Brighthouse. A \u00a3600 washing machine cost him \u00a31,500 after charges for interest from the shop, which has drawn the ire of politicians for the cost of its products. \u201cThey charge ridiculous amounts,\u201d he said. Living with his wife, two children and granddaughter, a change in the benefits system left him \u00a3400 a month worse off. \u201cI was gutted as you\u2019ve still got to live,\u201d he added. Since the steady decline of London\u2019s docklands since the 1960s, the borough which hugs the wider, muddier parts of the Thames, has had high levels of unemployment and a changing population. It was a predominantly white, working class area until as recently as the 1990s, although it now has the highest concentration of black and minority ethnic groups in the country, making up more than 70% of the population. The borough voted narrowly for remain in the Brexit referendum, with 53% voting to stay \u2013 a much narrower result than the 60% average across London. There are some serious social problems. A rise in gang violence has led to more shootings, while the borough has also become a hotspot for acid attacks. Stephen Timms, the Labour MP for East Ham, sits drinking tea in an empty cafe in a park in his constituency, which falls within the borough. \u201cIt\u2019s rather disappointing to learn we\u2019re right at the top of the list for indebtedness. It\u2019s a legacy, I think, of very high levels of unemployment over time, which has led to the problems which the data highlights,\u201d he said. Things have improved in recent years, although living costs have shot up in an area where many jobs are low skilled and low paid. The employment rate in Newham \u2013 which encompasses areas such as West Ham, Stratford, Canning Town, Royal Docks and Beckton \u2013 has gone from about 52% a decade ago to 68.7% \u2013 below the London average of 73.8%. The national average at that time was more than 74%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. Sir Robin Wales, the borough\u2019s elected Labour mayor, points to Moneyworks and a job exchange called Workplace his council has introduced to help ease local problems. He says Workplace has filled more than 35,000 vacancies since launching in 2007, and that Moneyworks is a drain on his budget, as it underwrites loans \u2013 many of which default \u2013 in partnership with the London Community Credit Union. Sat in the back room at Moneyworks (occupying a unit once used by a fashion chain that collapsed under its own huge debts), he said: \u201cWe\u2019re lending to people who can\u2019t get credit. To people that would ultimately end up being the customers for these people [payday lenders and loan sharks]. If we can siphon enough of them off, we\u2019ll break their business model.\u201d East Ham high street in the north-east of the borough has a string of shops closely linked with high levels of debt. Payday lenders, pawnbrokers and bookmakers are dotted at regular intervals. Fixed odds betting terminals are seen as a menace by the political leaders, who want to cap wagers. Whether it\u2019s a case of correlation or causation is up for debate, but there\u2019s no denying rising costs and government austerity have had a big impact. Carl Packman, a researcher at the debt charity Toynbee Hall, which has helped the East End\u2019s poor since 1884, said: \u201cPrevious research has been quite clear on what\u2019s causing a spike in indebtedness in the area: cuts to benefits and public services directly leading to lower income households in areas of deprivation taking on more debt just to get by.\u201d Newham has 4,690 benefit claimants, or 2% of the local population, just above the UK average. Southwark has the most in London, with 7,390, or 2.9% of the local population, according to the Office for National Statistics. There\u2019s been a massive growth in the use of food banks, according to Timms, as benefit cuts hit residents. \u201cQuite a significant number of people who come to see me are struggling with housing and rapidly increasing rents, and of course the effects of the benefits cap. The vice there is getting tighter and tighter,\u201d he said. Household incomes are significantly below the national average. Before housing costs, the median income was \u00a315,704, compared with the national \u00a322,204, according to a 2014 study by the London School of Economics \u2013 the most recent data available. \u201cHousing is a dominant problem in Newham, and across London, but the level of poverty and low income in Newham make pressures on the poorest particularly acute,\u201d it found. About half of the 260,000 residents in Newham rent privately, with about 30% in social or affordable housing. The remaining minority are homeowners. The median monthly cost of a one bedroom flat in the area was \u00a31,200 in March, up from \u00a3801 in June 2011. Half of landlords in the borough fail to declare their income. The Money Advice Service analysis reveals a picture of over-indebted individuals who are defined as those who are likely to find meeting monthly bills a \u201cheavy burden\u201d and those missing more than three bill payments within a six-month period. Newham\u2019s neighbouring London borough, Tower Hamlets, is the next in line as the most heavily indebted in the country, followed by Sandwell in the West Midlands. East Dorset, Mole Valley in Surrey and Chiltern, Buckinghamshire, have the lowest proportion of over-indebted residents in the UK. Colin Kinloch of the Money Advice Service said: \u201cThere are many positives in Stratford, it looks very different shiny and new, and the work the community and the mayor has been doing is to be commended. But it would seem through our data that there are persistent high levels of debt there.\u201d Examples of deprivation abound. Wales said his officers found three people working in a chicken shop paid \u00a31 an hour, all sleeping in a single bedroom. Rent control might work, according to the mayor, but the \u201cbest control in the private sector is you build so many homes that landlords can\u2019t charge the ridiculous amounts they can, because there\u2019s so many homes\u201d. Newham got a shot in the arm from the Olympics in 2012, bringing redevelopment projects and the construction of the Westfield shopping centre with the creation of about 8,000 jobs \u2013 of which 2,000 were taken by local residents. Brexit threatens to unpick some of this success, although it might also bring some short-term relief to the area if migrant workers leave or don\u2019t come in the near future. Fewer workers might mean the potential for higher wages, as the labour market tightens, but many economists dispute the link between immigration and low wages. Wales said: \u201cYou have fewer people here, that could ease the pressure on rents. Fewer people here, could help us get more local people into work. But not being part of Europe, it could mean less jobs, and less good jobs, and as we\u2019re less welcoming [of business], which in turn means less jobs.\u201d Back at the Stratford Centre, the tattier cousin on the other side of the tracks from Westfield, Edward, an unemployed cleaner, says the area has changed for the worse in the 50 years since he was born there. \u201cThere\u2019s too many people coming in. They belong to gangs,\u201d he said. Seeking help with rent arrears and other debts, he\u2019s typical of the Moneyworks\u2019 clientele, and shows why starting the centre comes with great political benefits for Wales and the council. \u201cI used to think he was a money-grabbing whatsit, on the other side of the fence,\u201d he says, fighting back a tear. \u201cSince I\u2019ve been coming in here \u2013 you see the people here \u2013 he\u2019s helped me so much I cannot thank him enough.\u201d",

This left her with more than \u00a328,000 of borrowing to repay alone. The mother of two from Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, used the cards to support her and her husband after their successful engineering company \u2013 which supplied parts to local factories including Heinz \u2013 hit hard times. But hers was the only name on the account and she is now struggling to pay after her husband left her. \u201cThey just kept topping it up, or they\u2019d just give it us. They never asked for any income to support it,\u201d she said. Credit card lenders appear to be targeting people struggling with unaffordable levels of debt, according to research from the charity Citizens Advice, who helped Tracy to manage her problems. Almost one in five people struggling with debts have had their credit card limit raised without them requesting it, leading the charity to demand the Financial Conduct Authority ban the practice. There are growing concerns over the boom in consumer debt in the UK, with more than \u00a368.7bn owed on credit cards in July \u2013 the most on record \u2013 according to the Bank of England. Tracy helped support her husband after he was told in 2007 he would never work again following three back operations. As the sole breadwinner, with the family firm in dire straits, she turned to credit cards to see them through. \u201cWe were managing to pay everything on the minimum payments. It was like robbing Peter to pay Paul \u2013 offsetting one against the other. Using them to pay bills,\u201d she said. At one point, one credit card company was demanding \u00a3700 a month. However, her wages were only \u00a31,000, leaving very little to live on. She went to Citizens Advice in Oldham in 2014, to say she was \u201cin too deep,\u201d while she sold the family home to cut their debts from \u00a373,000 to \u00a343,000. Her husband then unexpectedly left her over a bank holiday weekend last year, leaving her with debts of more than \u00a328,000 on four credit cards and a bank overdraft. \u201cHe left with the debts in my name. He\u2019s taking no responsibility for them,\u201d she said. Rather than go into bankruptcy \u2013 risking her pension \u2013 Tracy is using a voluntary payment package with the help of Citizens Advice that helped to drop the interest on her borrowing. \u201cI want to pay these debts back,\u201d she said. Now renting a room at a friend\u2019s house and working in accounts administration for a garage in Oldham, she still owes more than \u00a324,000, to be repaid at \u00a3254 a month over the next nine years. She says that is far more than she ever borrowed, as interest charges far outstrip the original debts. \u201cI can\u2019t move on with life until I\u2019m about 62, when it\u2019s too late to get a mortgage and start afresh. For a lot of people, they won\u2019t own up to it \u2013 it\u2019s the embarrassment of it all. But it does take the pressure of when you get professional advice,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s debt timebomb is primed and ready to go off at any time. From never-never spending on credit cards to car loans, from overdrafts to payday loans, there is enough high explosive to devastate the economy for a second time in decade. All that is required is for the fuse to be lit. The Bank of England is aware of the risks and has been issuing ever-more explicit warnings about debt as the summer has worn on. One of Threadneedle Street\u2019s senior officials told lenders in July that they were dicing with a spiral of complacency by encouraging people to borrow money they might not be able to pay back. The warnings are fully justified, even if the Bank of England has itself been responsible for the build-up in debt. After all, in the first 313 years of the Bank\u2019s existence, official borrowing costs never once fell below 2%. in 2009 they were cut to 0.5% and left there until shortly after last year\u2019s EU referendum when they were shaved further \u2013 this time to 0.25%. Such low interest rates were deemed necessary in 2009 to prevent what was already the country\u2019s most severe recession since the second world war from turning into a repeat of the Great Depression. The Bank did not envisage keeping rates at record low levels for more than eight years, but that is what has happened. Low interest rates were supposed to encourage people to borrow rather than to save \u2013 and that is precisely what has happened. Household debt levels as a share of national output are edging back to the record levels seen in the boom years in the build-up to the financial crisis. There have been three stages to this process. In phase one, during the crisis and its immediate aftermath, appetite for debt waned markedly and households took advantage of low interest rates to pay off some of the money they had borrowed during the good times. But with higher oil prices pushing up inflation, wage growth weak and austerity biting, this meant recovery from the downturn was slow. As a result, the government took steps to encourage banks to lend and people to borrow. The Funding for Lending Scheme provided incentives for lenders to make credit available for mortgages and business loans, while help to buy provided state subsidies for those trying to get a foot on the housing ladder. The strategy worked \u2013 at least in the short term. Activity increased in the housing market, pushing up property prices and generating a feelgood factor among those fortunate enough to be owner-occupiers. With the collapse in oil prices driving inflation down to zero, the years 2013-16 were good years for consumers: their pay packets went further, unemployment was falling and house prices were going up. Lenders, too, felt more confident and started to offer more attractive deals to borrowers. As Bank of England executive director Alex Brazier noted, the interest rate on a \u00a310,000 personal loan has fallen from 10% in 2010 to 4% today. Credit card companies have been tempting customers with longer periods of 0% interest rates if they switch. Unsecured consumer credit is growing at 10% a year \u2013 six times as fast as the economy\u2019s growth rate. Stage three of the process began in June last year when the UK voted to leave the EU. Both the Treasury and the Bank expected this to have dire consequences for the economy, with the then chancellor George Osborne predicting a deep recession and a 500,000 increase in unemployment within two years. The Bank cut interest rates in early August 2016 in the hope of stimulating some extra demand and was surprised at the result. Instead of collapsing, the economy grew more quickly in the second half of 2016 than it had in the first half. Consumers could see that the fall in the value of the pound would push up the cost of imported goods and so decided to buy big-ticket items \u2013 often with borrowed money \u2013 before prices went up. Spending plans were brought forwards, with the result that strong growth in late 2016 has been followed by weak growth in early 2017. Real incomes have been squeezed because prices have been rising more rapidly than wages. Borrowing has helped to fill the gap. For now, debt is a problem for some individuals but not for the economy as a whole. Debt servicing costs are much lower than they were before the crisis and the unemployment rate is at its lowest since 1975. Difficulties would only really arise if the Bank felt the need to raise interest rates aggressively or if unemployment were to increase sharply for any reason. Both occurred in the bust of the late 1980s and 1990s, when interest rates were doubled to 15% and unemployment rose above 3 million. Imagining the circumstances in which the debt timebomb might go off is not all that difficult. There could be a severe run on the pound if the Brexit talks go badly, which would force the Bank of England to raise interest rates despite its concern about the impact on heavily indebted borrowers. A trade war between the US and China could derail what has been a fairly feeble global economic recovery. In truth, it would not take all that much to light what looks to be a fairly short fuse.",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets have begun the week on a positive note, as investors shrugged off any lingering worries about geopolitical tensions and central bank actions. They seemed reassured that there were no further developments in the North Korea situation over the weekend, presumably on the basis that no news is good news. And despite the recent hints from the Bank of England that a UK rate rise could come as soon as November, new comments from Bank governor Mark Carney that any increases were likely to be gradual and limited saw the pound come of its recent highs. This in turn helped lift the FTSE 100, given that a weaker pound benefits exporters. European markets were also caught up in the optimism, while on on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite all hit new record highs ahead of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 37.81 points or 0.52% at 7253.28 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.32% to 12,559.39 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.3% to 5229.32 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.61% better at 22,364.74 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.2% at 10,338.4 But in Greece, the Athens market fell 1.99% to 760.79 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.34% at 22,344 having earlier hit a new peak of 22,355. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. A sharp fall in migrant workers coming to Britain as a consequence of Brexit could push up wages and cause a spike in inflation in the short term, according to Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, writes my colleague Richard Partington. Setting out his view on inflation days after the Bank\u2019s rate setting panel indicated it could raise the cost of borrowing for the first time in a decade, the governor said the rapid deceleration of migrant labour could lead to shortages for employers, pushing up wage growth and inflation in the short term. However, in the long-term, higher levels of immigration do not have an impact on wages or inflation, he said. In a speech in Washington, he said: \u201cAbrupt decreases in migration could result in shortages in some sectors that have become reliant on migrant labour, and contribute more materially to inflationary pressures.\u201d In the longer-term, \u201cBrexit could therefore ultimately have only a modest impact on prices in general equilibrium.\u201d Carney also warned that a fall in immigration in the wake of Brexit could push up wages and inflation: Abrupt decreases in migration could result in shortages in some sectors that have become reliant on migrant labour, and contribute more materially to inflationary pressures. In addition, the ease with which UK employers have been able to source labour from abroad and move operations offshore as a result of globalisation may have weighed on wage growth \u2013 though the size of such contestability effects is difficult to judge. Brexit is likely to push up inflation, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said, as he repeated his view that interest rates were likely to rise in the coming months. But in his 2017 IMF Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture in Washington, he suggested rises would be limited, and he warned of risks to the UK economy. These comments have seen the pound slip back further against the dollar. Down 0.26% earlier, sterling has now fallen 0.54% against the dollar to $1.3518. Against the euro the pound is down 0.65% at \u20ac1.1302. Carney said: Any prospective increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, and to be consistent with monetary policy continuing to provide substantial support to the economy. There remain considerable risks to the UK outlook, which include the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal. The MPC will respond to these developments as they occur insofar as they affect the behaviour of households and businesses, and the outlook for inflation. On Brexit, Reuters reports: Carney, making a speech at the International Monetary Fund\u2019s headquarters in Washington, said the process of globalisation that has led to deeper integration in the world economy in recent decades had pushed down price growth. But Brexit represented the opposite for Britain, at least in the short term, as less openness to foreign markets and workers was likely to push up inflation and reduce productivity, he said. \u201cOn balance, the de-integration effects of Brexit can be expected to ... be inflationary,\u201d he said. \u201cAt present, the main question concerns the extent to which this adjustment has been brought forward.\u201d ...In his speech on Monday, Carney also said Britain was unlikely to immediately offset any weakening of trade ties with its EU partners by striking new trade agreements with other countries. \u201cBut Brexit is an example of \u2018reculer pour mieux sauter,\u2019\u201d Carney said, using a French expression which means stepping back in order to jump better Bank of England governor Mark Carney is set to give the 2017 Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture, and it can be viewed live here now. US markets continue to fly higher: The pound has slipped back against the dollar after last week\u2019s rises in the wake of suggestions of a UK interest rate rise in November. Part of this is due to an uptick in the dollar ahead of this week\u2019s US Federal Reserve meeting, and part to new concerns over Brexit. Sterling is currently 0.26% lower at $1.3556. Paresh Davdra, chief executive of RationalFX, said: The pound has moved lower against its peers ...following its surge on Friday. The pound remained strong over the weekend, still buoyed by investor anticipation of an interest rate rise later this year, but has cooled off as traders turn their attention to Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s speech on Europe, this Friday. Despite slipping against the dollar this morning, sterling is still much stronger than the weak levels seen in recent weeks. The pound may have also been weighed down slightly by the renewed political controversy over the \u2018Britain will have \u00a3350m a week more to spend outside the EU\u2019 claim from Foreign secretary Boris Johnson over the weekend. In the months since the election, political disunity has made traders cautious, therefore any suggestion of dissent within the government could slow the gains the pound could make off of the prospect of a rate rise. With the Prime Minister in Canada to discuss trade deals, analysts will be looking at more political drivers for the pound this week, in addition to data releases. With investors turning their attention to supposedly riskier assets such as shares, there have been some falls among the traditional havens. Gold fell to a two and a half week low of $1311 an ounce while among equities, there are also falls in defensive stocks like tobacco - Imperial Brands is down 2% - and water companies. Records are indeed being broken on Wall Street in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed to a new peak of 22,332, up more than 0.22%, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.13% to a new high of 2,503. Easing tensions over North Korea are playing a part, while investors are awaiting the latest Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. European markets are holding on to their gains ahead of Wall Street opening shortly. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.3%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.25% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.16%. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open around 40 points higher. Over in Washington, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde is promising a new crackdown on corruption. Channelling Captain Renault in Casablanca, Lagarde is telling a Brookings Institution event that no-one should be shocked to learn that some public officials accept bribes, and that some companies are keen to offer them. Citing the \u201cPanama Papers\u201d revelations, Lagarde says the IMF can and will do more to tackle corruption. She warns: As we assist our members in fighting public corruption, we also are committed to looking at transnational private actors who influence public officials. Private actors may help generate corruption through direct means such as bribery, but they also can facilitate corruption through indirect means, such as money laundering and tax evasion. The recent example of the \u201cPanama Papers\u201d highlights the importance of these facilitators, and underscores the pernicious way corruption can quietly spread across borders. Increased transparency and accountability can help reduce corruption, Lagarde, adds, along with strengthening legal institutions to tackle wrongdoers.... The oddest story of the day is that tens of thousands of euros have been found the toilet at a Geneva branch of UBS. The discovery, a few months ago, has baffled Swiss prosecutors - especially as more euros were discovered clogging the pipes of near by restaurants too. Bloomberg has more details. The stock markets are increasingly being driven by greed this week, says CNN: That\u2019s based on a series of metrics, including market volatility and demand for \u2018put options\u2019 (a right to sell at a certain price, which would be profitable if shares fell). The US stock market is expected to hit new highs when trading begins in two hours time. The S&amp;P 500 index is called up 0.2%, extending Friday\u2019s rally, as anxiety over conflict in the Korean peninsula abates. Charalambos Pissouros, senior analyst at IronFX, says: \u201c....as long as the situation does not escalate into military conflict, market participants may continue to place less and less emphasis on North Korean developments.\u201d A reminder of how the markets have rallied strongly over the last 18 months..... British arms manufacturer BAE has jumped to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard this morning, after announcing a big sale to Qatar. BAE is selling 24 Eurofighter Typhoons to Qatar, in a deal which analysts reckon is worth over \u00a31bn. Defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon says its a significant move: \u201cThis is an important moment in our defence relationship and the basis for even closer defence co-operation between our two countries.\u201d It\u2019s also an important moment in Qatar\u2019s relationship with its neighbours. Three months ago, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt all cut off diplomatic relations, accusing Doha of promoting terrorism. These Middle Eastern tensions could be good for business, as David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Last month, Goldman Sachs added the stock to its conviction buy list, citing Saudi Arabian contracts as the reason behind the move, and now they are selling to Qatar too. Here\u2019s a chart showing how the MSCI All Country World Index hit a new record high this morning. The ACWI tracks 2,400 stocks in 47 countries, so gives a gauge of equity valuations around the globe. As you can see, it has more than doubled since 2009, when the financial crisis triggered a global recession. So what\u2019s behind the recovery, and can it last? Here\u2019s a few thoughts 1) Easy Money. Central banks fired up their electronic money printing presses when the crisis broke, creating hundreds of billions of new euros, dollars and pounds to buy assets and support the economy. The idea was to make encourage commercial banks to lend, and buy riskier assets, but these asset purchase schemes ended up driving bond and share prices to record levels. The European Central Bank (which started later) is still expanding its balance sheet, while the Bank of England isn\u2019t close to unwinding QE. America\u2019s Federal Reserve is further along the path to ending easy money, having started raising interest rates. That\u2019s why Wednesday\u2019s Fed meeting is so important, as it will signal how quickly or slowly it will proceed along this path. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, says: \u201cCentral banks have underpinned equity market valuations since the financial crisis, with excess liquidity and low interest rates both providing the stimulus and the foundations for higher valuations. What global central banks and in particular the Federal Reserve does next is therefore hugely important for investors. 2) Eurozone crisis fades from memory. Although Greece\u2019s economy is still struggling, the prospect of European monetary union fracturing has receded over the last two years. S&amp;P\u2019s decision to upgrade Portugal back to investment grade highlights how the eurozone economy, if not exactly booming, is looking much healthier. 3) China hasn\u2019t suffered a hard landing (yet). Economists have been warning for years that China\u2019s economy is riddled with bad debt, and that its shadow banking sector is going to implode. Beijing, though, seems to be succeeding in curbing the worst excesses without hurting growth. 4) Global economy is still growing. Despite shocks such as Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, and the Brexit vote, the world economy is still managing steady if unspectacular growth. The IMF predicts that global gross domestic product would rise by 3.5% this year, and by 3.6%. That should support corporate profits, and thus share prices (which ought to reflect a company\u2019s earnings potential). 5) Geopolitical worries recede. Markets have notoriously short memories, so the recent dialling down of rhetoric between North Korea and @RealDonaldTrump is also helping to nudge shares higher. Yesterday. US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said American hopes that a \u201cpeaceful pressure\u201d campaign will succeed in denuclearizing North Korea. That sort of diplomatic jaw-jaw tends to reassure investors.... So, 10 years after the financial crisis, what should we worry about? BIS, the organisation for central bankers, gave us a clue last night. It warned that global growth could stumble once interest rates start to rise. This is the \u2018punch bowl\u2019 worry - that the markets are intoxicated on cheap credit, and will slump onto the carpet when it\u2019s taken away. BIS\u2019s Claudio Borio fears that the world could be caught in a debt trap, saying: Debt service ratios are only so low because interest rates have been falling so much. There is a certain circularity in all this that points to the risk of a debt trap: the protracted decline in interest rates to unusually low levels, regardless of the strength of the underlying economy, creates the conditions that complicate their subsequent return to more normal levels. Just in: Prices across the eurozone rose by 1.5% per year last month, up from 1.3% in July, stats body Eurostat says. That confirms the \u2018flash\u2019 reading from two weeks ago, and means inflation is still below the ECB\u2019s goal of close to, but below, 2%. Energy prices rose by 4%, while services costs picked by by 1.6% and food prices gained 1.4%. That ripping noise you can hear is HSBC tearing up its sterling forecasts. The bank has ditched its forecast that the pound would have hit $1.20 by the end of 2017, and languished there through 2018. Now it believes sterling will cling onto today\u2019s $1.35, and only slide slightly next year. Quite a change, triggered by last week\u2019s signals from the Bank of England that interest rates could rise in November. Meanwhile, the pound is slipping back from Friday\u2019s one-year high. Sterling is down almost half a cent at $1.354, having surged last week when the Bank of England dropped several clanging hints that interest rates are going up soon. Traders are looking to prime minister Theresa May\u2019s upcoming Europe speech on Friday, for signs that the UK is heading towards a hard or soft Brexit. They\u2019re also watching the unfolding row between Boris Johnson and the UK\u2019s statistics offices, after the foreign secretary reheated the idea that Britain will have \u00a3350m to spend on the NHS every week after Brexit. The markets are also benefitting from optimism that Portugal is putting the eurozone debt crisis behind it. Portugal\u2019s bond prices have hit a one-year high this morning, after credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s upgraded the country back to investment grade. Lisbon\u2019s stock market has surged by 1.8%. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is also clawing back some of last week\u2019s losses (triggered by the stronger pound). It\u2019s up 31 points at 7246, having hit a five-month low on Friday. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Having been battered in the wake of last week\u2019s sterling super surge, the FTSE is using a quiet Monday morning to claw back some of its losses. Precious metals producers Randgold and Fresnillo are the biggest fallers, down around 1%, as traders move into riskier assets. European stock markets have joined the rally, sending the Stoxx 600 index up to a six-week high. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, agrees that investors are focused on Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. Upbeat U.S. inflation data was not enough to move markets\u2019 expectations of an interest rate hike in December. The odds for an interest rate hike by the end of year stands at 56%, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch; whether this is about to change on Wednesday, relies on the Fed dot plot and Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s speech. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets have hit a new alltime high this morning, as traders regain their appetite for risky assets. The City is relieved that we\u2019ve not seen any fresh missile tests from North Korea in recent days, taking the risk of nuclear war off traders\u2019 minds. Investors are also preparing for a crucial US central bank meeting on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, and give more guidance on how it will unwind its massive bond-purchase programme. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says some Fed policymakers, such as Lael Brainard, may signal that US interest rates will only rise modestly. Markets anticipate that the Fed will keep rates unchanged (with a December rate hike now seen as 50/50), but announce that it will commence balance sheet reduction at a pace of $10bn per month in Q4. The statement will doubtless keep the option of a December rate hike clearly on the table, but markets will as ever hone in on the \u2018dot plot\u2019, with many expecting the likes of Brainard to perhaps adjust their trajectory lower Anything that keep the era of easy money alive is good for share prices. So, the MSCI\u2019s All Country World Index has nudged a new peak of 485.82 this morning, as traders pile back into equities. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reckons the markets may be getting \u2018desensitised\u2019 to the North Korean issue. Short of shots being fired, these tensions are likely to have fairly short term and short lived effects, which helps explain the positive start to the week for Asia shares this morning which in turn is likely to lead to a positive start to this week\u2019s European trading session. Indeed, stock markets in Asia are at their highest level in a decade today. South Korea\u2019s Kospi closed at a six-week high, led by tech shares, and Thailand is also rallying. European stock markets are following suit, gaining around 0.5% at the start of trading: Traders will also we watching out for updated eurozone inflation figures, and a speech from Bank of England governor Mark Carney this afternoon. Here\u2019s the agenda: 10am BST: The final eurozone inflation reading for August. They\u2019re expected to confirm that prices rose by 1.5% last month, up from 1.3% in July, but still below the European Central Bank\u2019s target of just below 2%. 4pm BST: Bank of England governor Mark Carney delivers the 2017 Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture in Washington DC. Investors will be looking for any fresh clues about future UK interest rate rises, but Carney may address an issue with more global appeal....",

And despite the recent hints from the Bank of England that a UK rate rise could come as soon as November, new comments from Bank governor Mark Carney that any increases were likely to be gradual and limited saw the pound come of its recent highs. This in turn helped lift the FTSE 100, given that a weaker pound benefits exporters.</p> <p>European markets were also caught up in the optimism, while on on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite all hit new record highs ahead of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished up 37.81 points or 0.52% at 7253.28<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.32% to 12,559.39</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.3% to 5229.32</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.61% better at 22,364.74</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.2% at 10,338.4</strong></li> <li><strong>But in Greece, the Athens market fell 1.99% to 760.79</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.34% at 22,344 having earlier hit a new peak of 22,355.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day.

Down 0.26% earlier, sterling has now fallen 0.54% against the dollar to $1.3518. Against the euro the pound is down 0.65% at \u20ac1.1302. Carney said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Any prospective increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, and to be consistent with monetary policy continuing to provide substantial support to the economy. </p> <p>There remain considerable risks to the UK outlook, which include the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal. The MPC will respond to these developments as they occur insofar as they affect the behaviour of households and businesses, and the outlook for inflation. </p> </blockquote> <p>On Brexit, Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Carney, making a speech at the International Monetary Fund\u2019s headquarters in Washington, said the process of globalisation that has led to deeper integration in the world economy in recent decades had pushed down price growth.</p> <p>But Brexit represented the opposite for Britain, at least in the short term, as less openness to foreign markets and workers was likely to push up inflation and reduce productivity, he said.</p> <p>\u201cOn balance, the de-integration effects of Brexit can be expected to ... be inflationary,\u201d he said. \u201cAt present, the main question concerns the extent to which this adjustment has been brought forward.\u201d</p> <p>...In his speech on Monday, Carney also said Britain was unlikely to immediately offset any weakening of trade ties with its EU partners by striking new trade agreements with other countries.</p> <p>\u201cBut Brexit is an example of \u2018reculer pour mieux sauter,\u2019\u201d Carney said, using a French expression which means stepping back in order to jump better</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T15:13:48.647Z\">at 4.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59bfdf34e4b08e19a9efc1cf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T15:00:06.592Z\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bank of England governor Mark Carney is set to give the 2017 Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture, and it can be <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/en/News/Events/2017-michel-camdessus-central-banking-lecture\">viewed live here</a> now.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59bfd90be4b07c06ffc86289\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T14:33:13.021Z\">3.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets continue to fly higher:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/charliebilello/status/909778440458469376\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MondayMotivation?src=hash\">#MondayMotivation</a><br>S&amp;P: All-Time High<br>Dow: All-Time High<br>Nasdaq: All-Time High<br>NYSE: All-Time High<br>Global Dow: All-Time High <a href=\"https://t.co/ynBGMwMtTj\">pic.twitter.com/ynBGMwMtTj</a></p>&mdash; Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/charliebilello/status/909778440458469376\">September 18, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59bfd544e4b07c06ffc86276\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T14:20:01.064Z\">3.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound has slipped back against the dollar after last week\u2019s rises in the wake of suggestions of a UK interest rate rise in November.</p> <p>Part of this is due to an uptick in the dollar ahead of this week\u2019s US Federal Reserve meeting, and part to new concerns over Brexit.

Paresh Davdra, chief executive of RationalFX, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound has moved lower against its peers ...following its surge on Friday. The pound remained strong over the weekend, still buoyed by investor anticipation of an interest rate rise later this year, but has cooled off as traders turn their attention to Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s speech on Europe, this Friday. Despite slipping against the dollar this morning, sterling is still much stronger than the weak levels seen in recent weeks.</p> <p>The pound may have also been weighed down slightly by the renewed political controversy over the \u2018Britain will have \u00a3350m a week more to spend outside the EU\u2019 claim from Foreign secretary Boris Johnson over the weekend. In the months since the election, political disunity has made traders cautious, therefore any suggestion of dissent within the government could slow the gains the pound could make off of the prospect of a rate rise.

As you can see, it has more than doubled since 2009, when the financial crisis triggered a global recession.</p> <p>So what\u2019s behind the recovery, and can it last? Here\u2019s a few thoughts</p> <p><strong>1) Easy Money. </strong>Central banks fired up their electronic money printing presses when the crisis broke, creating hundreds of billions of new euros, dollars and pounds to buy assets and support the economy. The idea was to make encourage commercial banks to lend, and buy riskier assets, but these asset purchase schemes ended up driving bond and share prices to record levels.</p> <p>The European Central Bank (which started later) is still expanding its balance sheet, while the Bank of England isn\u2019t close to unwinding QE.</p> <p>America\u2019s Federal Reserve is further along the path to ending easy money, having started raising interest rates. That\u2019s why Wednesday\u2019s Fed meeting is so important, as it will signal how quickly or slowly it will proceed along this path.</p> <p><strong>Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, </strong>head of investment at<strong> Interactive Investor,</strong> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cCentral banks have underpinned equity market valuations since the financial crisis, with excess liquidity and low interest rates both providing the stimulus and the foundations for higher valuations.</p> <p>What global central banks and in particular the Federal Reserve does next is therefore hugely important for investors. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>2) Eurozone crisis fades from memory</strong>. Although Greece\u2019s economy is still struggling, the prospect of European monetary union fracturing has receded over the last two years. </p> <p>S&amp;P\u2019s decision to upgrade Portugal back to investment grade highlights how the eurozone economy, if not exactly booming, is looking much healthier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DeItaOne/status/909687403589324800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">PORTUGUESE BOND YIELDS SET FOR BIGGEST DAILY FALL SINCE FEB 2016, DOWN 22 BASIS POINTS <a href=\"https://t.co/qVasgEegIA\">pic.twitter.com/qVasgEegIA</a></p>&mdash; *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaOne) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeItaOne/status/909687403589324800\">September 18, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>3) China hasn\u2019t suffered a hard landing (yet). </strong>Economists have been warning for years that China\u2019s economy is riddled with bad debt, and that its shadow banking sector is going to implode. Beijing, though, seems to be succeeding in curbing the worst excesses <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-gdp-grows-6-9-in-q2-beats-expectations/articleshow/59625960.cms\">without hurting growth</a>. </p> <p><strong>4) Global economy is still growing. </strong>Despite shocks such as Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, and the Brexit vote, the world economy is still managing steady if unspectacular growth.</p> <p>The IMF predicts that global gross domestic product would rise by 3.5% this year, and by 3.6%. That should support corporate profits, and thus share prices (which ought to reflect a company\u2019s earnings potential).</p> <p><strong>5) Geopolitical worries recede.</strong> Markets have notoriously short memories, so the recent dialling down of rhetoric between North Korea and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@RealDonaldTrump</a> is also helping to nudge shares higher. </p> <p>Yesterday. US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said American hopes that a \u201cpeaceful pressure\u201d campaign will succeed in denuclearizing North Korea. That sort of diplomatic jaw-jaw tends to reassure investors....</p> <p>So, 10 years after the financial crisis, what should we worry about?</p> <p><strong>BIS, the organisation for central bankers, gave us a clue last night</strong>. It warned that global growth could stumble once interest rates start to rise. This is the \u2018punch bowl\u2019 worry - that the markets are intoxicated on cheap credit, and will slump onto the carpet when it\u2019s taken away.</p> <p>BIS\u2019s Claudio Borio fears that the world could be caught in a debt trap, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Debt service ratios are only so low because interest rates have been falling so much.</p> <p>There is a certain circularity in all this that points to the risk of a debt trap: the protracted decline in interest rates to unusually low levels, regardless of the strength of the underlying economy, creates the conditions that complicate their subsequent return to more normal levels.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/17/growing-risk-of-debt-trap-if-interest-rates-remain-low-bank-warns\">Growing risk of 'debt trap' if interest rates stay low, say central bankers</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T10:23:15.165Z\">at 11.23am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59bf8b4fe4b06eeee7d81ae0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T09:04:20.098Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Just in: Prices across the eurozone rose by 1.5% per year last month, up from 1.3% in July, stats body Eurostat says.</strong></p> <p>That confirms the \u2018flash\u2019 reading from two weeks ago, and means inflation is still below the ECB\u2019s goal of close to, but below, 2%.</p> <p>Energy prices rose by 4%, while services costs picked by by 1.6% and food prices gained 1.4%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EU_Eurostat/status/909703571490271232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Euro area annual inflation confirmed at 1.5% in August 2017 (July 1.3%) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eurostat?src=hash\">#Eurostat</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rcCZSYalGk\">https://t.co/rcCZSYalGk</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/jslpebQ5Nm\">pic.twitter.com/jslpebQ5Nm</a></p>&mdash; EU_Eurostat (@EU_Eurostat) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EU_Eurostat/status/909703571490271232\">September 18, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59bf7c9de4b0eedd3619c072\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T08:04:37.904Z\">9.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">HSBC raises sterling forecasts</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>That ripping noise you can hear is HSBC tearing up its sterling forecasts.</p> <p>The bank has ditched its forecast that the pound would have hit $1.20 by the end of 2017, and languished there through 2018.

      "bodyText": "Global stock markets are at record highs, with the MSCI All Country World Index reaching a new peak on Monday and both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 heading for uncharted territory once more. European and UK markets are also attracting investors again, although they are below their best levels owing to the strength of the euro and the pound making exports pricier. Here are five reasons why investors are buying into shares. Political concerns fading Donald Trump\u2019s proposals for tax cuts and a spending spree to boost the US economy gave some impetus to stock markets after his election, but his inability to pass key reforms \u2013 notably on healthcare \u2013 raised doubts about his other plans. The president\u2019s belligerent rhetoric on most subjects also caused some concern. Recently, however, investors believe Trump may have started to understand the reality of his position, and be prepared to compromise to get deals done. Elsewhere Europe seems more stable since the election of Emmanuel Macron as president of France, and this weekend\u2019s German poll is likely to see Angela Merkel retain her position as chancellor, which is expected to be welcomed by the markets. North Korea tensions ease Markets have tended to have a knee-jerk reaction to the recent missile tests by North Korea and the subsequent tensions between the state and the US. But any decline has quickly been recovered. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cTensions with North Korea are likely to remain a distraction, however markets appear to be becoming desensitised to them at this time, and short of shots being fired, these tensions are likely to have fairly short term and short lived effects.\u201d Central banks unlikely to rush to end low rates and QE Markets have now been supported for a number of years by central banks providing cheap money and stimulus packages in the form of quantitative easing \u2013 or buying bonds off financial institutions in the hope they will invest the proceeds back into domestic economies. While the central banks are now beginning to turn off the money taps, they are taking a measured approach which has eased any investor fears of a sudden change of policy. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates three times since last December and while it is expected to leave things on hold at this week\u2019s meeting, another increase in December could be on the cards. However, recent uncertain economic figures for the world\u2019s largest economy, including retail sales, as well as the possible impact of the recent two storms means this is by no means certain. Meanwhile the Bank of England last week hinted it may increase rates in November, but while this gave an immediate boost to the pound, it only reverses the rise the Bank sanctioned in the immediate wake of the Brexit vote. On Monday, the Bank governor, Mark Carney, said any rises would be gradual and limited, bringing sterling back from its highs. The FTSE 100, which lost ground as the pound rose because so many of its constituents earn revenues in a foreign currency, is now recovering some of its losses. As for the European Central Bank, it has also hinted it will begin ending its bond buying programme, but it is in no rush to do so. European economy recovering One of the reasons the ECB can consider ending its stimulus measures is the economic picture in the eurozone. The financial crisis hit Europe hard, especially in the weaker economies such as Spain, Portugal and Greece, which is still in the midst of a bailout programme. But things have started to turn round, with the latest annualised growth numbers showing the eurozone growing at 2.3% compared with 2.2% for the US. Structural reforms, painful and slow as they may have been, are finally beginning to bear fruit. China\u2019s economy holding up Despite fears of a slowdown in China, which would have a dramatic knock-on effect on world growth, the country\u2019s economy \u2013 the world\u2019s second largest \u2013 appears to be holding up. Granted, a number of indicators including industrial production and retail sales proved disappointing in August and below the previous month\u2019s level. But analysts suggest the figures show that China was still growing at an annualised rate of about 5%, and the country\u2019s currency remains strong.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has promised to publish details on Tuesday of all the flights it plans to cancel over the next six weeks following a passenger revolt, a slump in its share price and an expected compensation bill of \u00a330m. The airline said on Twitter that \u201cBetween today and tomorrow all flight cancellations up and until OCT31 will be communicated.\u201d Furious passengers had been swamping the airline with demands to know if their flight was among the 40 to 55 the airline said it would cancel every day over the next six weeks. Initially, Ryanair was making available only lists of cancelled flights up to this Wednesday, 20 September. Ryanair blamed rostering problems for the delays. \u201cWe have messed up in the planning of pilot holidays and we\u2019re working hard to fix that,\u201d it said on Facebook. There have been claims that Ryanair has been haemorrhaging pilots to rival airlines. Norwegian, which is building a new hub in Ryanair\u2019s home airport, Dublin, said: \u201cWe can confirm that 140 pilots have joined Norwegian from Ryanair this year. Pilot recruitment is also under way for more pilots for our new Dublin base opening later this year.\u201d Reports in the Irish media suggest Ryanair has begun offering pilots a \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,800) \u201csigning-on bonus\u201d to join. Shares in the airline fell by 3% in early trading, knocking more than \u00a3500m off its \u00a318bn stock market valuation, although losses were pared back in later trading. The airline said it expected to face a compensation claims of up to \u20ac20m, while analysts at Dublin-based Goodbody Stockbrokers said the final bill was likely to be \u20ac34.5m (\u00a330.4m) as they marked down Ryanair\u2019s full-year profit forecast by 2.3%. The threat of cancellations sparked fury among passengers as millions were left in limbo, unsure whether their holidays would go ahead. Many expressed their disgust on Twitter over how Ryanair was handling the issue. One user said she feared for her wedding, with 30 Ryanair flights booked for her party, while others said that even if their outbound flight was not cancelled, they could not be sure if their inbound flight would be. Ryanair\u2019s usually combative boss, Michael O\u2019Leary, was widely mocked on social media for failing to speak, although the airline hurriedly arranged a press conference for later in the day. Investor groups said that while Ryanair usually brushes off poor publicity, in this case it could damage the airline. \u201cRyanair is notorious for not caring about what sort of headlines they get, working on the basis that all publicity is good publicity \u2013 but not this time,\u201d said Rebecca O\u2019Keefe of Interactive Investor. \u201cPreviously, the carrier was happy to suggest that you get what you pay for and despite negative press lots of flyers embraced the fact that they knew the score and were happy to fly without the frills. \u201cHowever, the current situation is truly damaging, with flyers left high and dry with last-minute cancellations or apprehensive that they might be affected.\u201d O\u2019Keefe said it was unclear whether the delays were caused by poor planning or a shortage of pilots. \u201cIf the former, then it suggests some truly poor processes. If the latter, then we may see wages rise to fill the gaps. Either way, it\u2019s not good news for Ryanair.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The father of the Bell Pottinger executive at the centre of the South Africa scandal that brought down the City PR firm has resigned from his role as a board member of London-listed pest control and hygiene firm Rentokil Initial. Chris Geoghegan \u2013 the father of 34-year-old Victoria Geoghegan who led the secret campaign that aimed to stir up racial tension in South Africa \u2013 has resigned as a non-executive director of Rentokil Initial where he was senior independent director and chair of the remuneration committee. The 63-year-old, a former top executive at defence company BAE Systems, was responsible for introducing the wealthy and controversial Gupta family to Bell Pottinger in January 2016. He received a monthly fee from the agency for his services. Following the meeting Bell Pottinger took on a \u00a3100,000-a-month contract to work for Gupta-owned Oakbay Capital, led by Victoria Geoghegan, which resulted in the PR and social media campaign focusing on \u201ceconomic apartheid\u201d and \u201cwhite monopoly capital\u201d in South Africa. The resignation of Geoghegan, who had only been at Rentokil since June last year, was announced by the company in a two-sentence statement on Monday. Geoghegan, who was on the board of BAE Systems from 2000 to 2007 and worked as joint chief operating officer, has held a string of senior executive roles at Airbus and BAE since starting in the aerospace industry in the 1970s. In July, Victoria Geoghegan was fired from Bell Pottinger at the same time as it made a U-turn, offering an \u201cunequivocal and absolute apology\u201d for an \u201cinappropriate and offensive\u201d social media campaign. The PR agency had initially maintained it was the victim of a smear campaign involving \u201ctotally false and damaging accusations\u201d. On Friday, the fallout of the scandal spread to the South African arm of KPMG, which audits companies owned by the Guptas, with the chief executive, chairman and a string of top executives resigning. The resignations followed an investigation by KPMG International which said that while it did not find any evidence of \u201cillegal behaviour or corruption\u201d at the firm, it did find \u201cwork that fell considerably short of KPMG\u2019s standards\u201d. KPMG donated the equivalent of 40m South African rand (\u00a32.2m) \u2013 the fees earned from Gupta company work from 2002 \u2013 to not-for-profit groups working in education and the anti-corruption sector. KPMG International\u2019s report also investigated the firm\u2019s work for the South African Revenue Service (SARS). KPMG offered to pay back the 23m South African rand (\u00a31.28m) fee for its work, or donate the same amount to charity. On Monday, Tom Moyane, commissioner of SARS, said that the body is to launch legal proceedings against KPMG over reputational damage caused by releasing details of the confidential report it produced for the tax agency. Moyane said that KPMG will be reported to Malusi Gigaba, South Africa\u2019s finance minister, with a view to blacklisting the company for its \u201cunethical\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d behaviour. Earlier this month, Bell Pottinger was expelled from the UK PR trade body for at least five years, and was subsequently put into administration as a client exodus left it unable to pay debts.",

    "webTitle": "Meet the woman fighting Wall Street's Flash Boys", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Like many people on Wall Street and beyond, Sara Furber devoured Michael Lewis\u2019s Flash Boys, the best-selling book that argued high-speed traders had rigged the world\u2019s biggest stock markets. Now, Furber has been tasked with proving that executives and investors really want an alternative. Lewis\u2019s book told the tale of Brad Katsuyama, who, while working at Royal Bank of Canada, spotted what he saw as a gigantic ripoff in the financial markets and set up a company, IEX, he hoped would end it. Last year, he hired Furber, a 20-year Wall Street veteran and managing director at Morgan Stanley, to head up the new stock exchange\u2019s listing business \u2013 poaching business from the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, arguably the two most powerful stock markets in the world. Next month, Furber hopes IEX will be up and running with its first listing as the exchange takes on a market that has been dominated by the two giants. Giants, she and Katsuyama argue, that have allowed the financial markets to be controlled by the interests of a subset of traders more interested in making a very quick buck than in long-term investors. \u201cFrom the outside looking in it was hard to really understand the level of conflicts that existed and the behaviour that existed. Reading Flash Boys was a window into that,\u201d says Furber, sitting in an office 44 floors above downtown Manhattan. Having spent a year here, she says \u201cthe levels of complexity and the level of conflicts that exist in the system still exist and in fact there may be other ones that we are seeing as we get further into it\u201d. As the fledgling exchange tries to make inroads, Furber will become one of Wall Street\u2019s most high-profile women. After two decades in finance she is a little saddened that that is the case. \u201cWomen on Wall Street are an important constituency and I would love to see more of them,\u201d she says. But there has not been as much improvement as she would like to see. \u201cThere are still very few women at the senior ranks and it is still very difficult,\u201d she says. She wonders if part of it is the perceived demands of the job. The biggest lesson she learned was that more responsibility didn\u2019t mean less freedom. \u201cI assumed the higher-profile, more senior position I would have, the less control I would have to manage the life I wanted outside of work. Having children, family balance. \u201cLooking back one of the biggest things I wish someone had told me is it\u2019s inversely correlated. The higher-profile, more responsibility roles, the more flexibility you have to structure your life the way you want. You have better people working for you, you have more authority, you are setting when the meetings are, what the agenda is. That control is really empowering. \u201cNobody looks at me for going to a parent teacher conference,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that level of autonomy exists at lower levels. Whether you are a man or a woman.\u201d IEX has rent Wall Street. In 2014, an argument between Katsuyama and Bill O\u2019Brien, then president of the Bats exchange, on CNBC brought trading to a standstill as the IEX founder and Lewis argued investors were being scammed. \u201cI believe the markets are rigged and I also think you\u2019re part of the rigging,\u201d Katsuyama told O\u2019Brien. Katsuyama (and Lewis) were guilty of \u201cfalsely accusing literally thousands of people and possibly scaring millions of investors in an effort to promote a business model\u201d, said O\u2019Brien. Much of the disagreement centers on the need \u2013 or not \u2013 for the new exchange\u2019s most famous claim to fame: a 38-mile coiled cable designed as a \u201cspeed bump\u201d to slow down the high-speed transactions that now dominate trading. The cable is designed to stop high-frequency traders (HFTs) using their algorithms to trade in and out of shares at speeds that allow them to take advantage of slower investors \u2013 often those looking to make a long-term bet on a company\u2019s fundamental worth. If you are IEX or its supporters this is tantamount to scalping. IEX\u2019s critics charge it is just how efficient markets operate in the digital age. Either way, it\u2019s all very complicated. And that\u2019s the problem, says Furber. Financial complexity is not only too much for ordinary investors, it\u2019s also too much for those on Wall Street. Furber ran investor relations at Merrill Lynch during the credit crisis. \u201cOne of the things that shaped my view incredibly was that there were a lot of people at that time saying: \u2018You just don\u2019t understand the risk, it\u2019s very complex.\u2019 As a smart, educated person, when people create a lot of complexity and opaqueness, we have to trust our gut. If you can\u2019t explain it, there is something fair about our sense of unease. What we are trying to do is create more transparency and simplicity because that creates better trust.\u201d Whoever you agree with, Wall Street does have a problem. Over the last decade the number of listed companies in the US has halved and the number of companies doing initial public offerings (IPOs) is also in freefall, down from about 300 a year in the 1990s to about 100 a year. Big companies like Albertsons, Bloomberg, Koch Industries are staying private. A new generation of tech giants, Airbnb, Pinterest, Lyft and Uber, are staying private for longer. Part of the reluctance to join the stock markets is because the existing exchanges seem more interested in making money for traders than helping long-term investors maximise their returns or companies raise money, says Furber. \u201cThe market structure we have today has evolved over the last 10 to 15 years and it\u2019s being optimised for different participants than companies and investors,\u201d she says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean everything doesn\u2019t work for them,\u201d she says, but there are \u201cpain points\u201d. NYSE and Nasdaq sell tiers of data and higher-speed services to traders who can use that advantage to make quick returns that are unavailable to those that don\u2019t pay up. IEX won\u2019t do that. \u201cEveryone says they are great in clients service but if your business model operates in a way that doesn\u2019t advantage them, I would question that,\u201d she says. On top of that there are a bunch of fees and rebates that IEX will do away with that she argues create \u201cfinancial incentives that aren\u2019t aligning the broker all the time with their client\u201d. But taking on the incumbent powers will not be easy. Nasdaq and NYSE dominate the listings market \u2013 IEX has about a 2% market share of trading in US equities. The two exchanges have fought hard against allowing IEX to become an exchange and its speed bump, arguing it added unnecessary complexity. But the Securities and Exchange Commission gave IEX the go-ahead last June. One of NYSE\u2019s exchanges, NYSE American, is now offering a speed bump too. \u201cIt validates the problems that exist,\u201d she says. The current big exchanges still drive a significant portion of their revenues from selling tiers of data and tiers of speed. \u201cThe people who can pay the most for that are still the people who can optimise those differences as competitive advantages,\u201d she says. \u201cImitation is the sincerest form of flattery,\u201d Furber says with a smile. It can also be the most deadly.",

Now, Furber has been tasked with proving that executives and investors really want an alternative.</p> <p>Lewis\u2019s book told the tale of Brad Katsuyama, who, while working at Royal Bank of Canada, spotted what he saw as a gigantic ripoff in the financial markets and set up a company, IEX, he hoped would end it.</p> <p>Last year, he hired Furber, a 20-year Wall Street veteran and managing director at Morgan Stanley, to head up the new stock exchange\u2019s listing business \u2013 poaching business from the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, arguably the two most powerful stock markets in the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/03/michael-lewis-i-knew-flash-boys-would-be-a-bombshell\">Michael Lewis: 'I knew Flash Boys would be a bombshell'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Next month, Furber hopes IEX will be up and running with its first listing as the exchange takes on a market that has been dominated by the two giants. Giants, she and Katsuyama argue, that have allowed the financial markets to be controlled by the interests of a subset of traders more interested in making a very quick buck than in long-term investors.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the outside looking in it was hard to really understand the level of conflicts that existed and the behaviour that existed. Reading Flash Boys was a window into that,\u201d says Furber, sitting in an office 44 floors above downtown Manhattan.</p> <p>Having spent a year here, she says \u201cthe levels of complexity and the level of conflicts that exist in the system still exist and in fact there may be other ones that we are seeing as we get further into it\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>As the fledgling exchange tries to make inroads, Furber will become one of Wall Street\u2019s most high-profile women.</p> <p>After two decades in finance she is a little saddened that that is the case. \u201cWomen on Wall Street are an important constituency and I would love to see more of them,\u201d she says. But there has not been as much improvement as she would like to see.</p> <p>\u201cThere are still very few women at the senior ranks and it is still very difficult,\u201d she says. She wonders if part of it is the perceived demands of the job. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f52822e71b91cc20e255a394eba923e91725e2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f52822e71b91cc20e255a394eba923e91725e2f/0_452_6782_4069/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sara Fuber.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sara Fuber.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Smith for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The biggest lesson she learned was that more responsibility didn\u2019t mean less freedom. \u201cI assumed the higher-profile, more senior position I would have, the less control I would have to manage the life I wanted outside of work. Having children, family balance.<br></p> <p>\u201cLooking back one of the biggest things I wish someone had told me is it\u2019s inversely correlated. The higher-profile, more responsibility roles, the more flexibility you have to structure your life the way you want. You have better people working for you, you have more authority, you are setting when the meetings are, what the agenda is. That control is really empowering.</p> <p>\u201cNobody looks at me for going to a parent teacher conference,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that level of autonomy exists at lower levels. Whether you are a man or a woman.\u201d</p> <p>IEX has rent Wall Street. In 2014, an argument between Katsuyama and Bill O\u2019Brien, then president of the Bats exchange, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2014/04/01/katsuyama-vs-obrien--who-won-the-fight.html\">on CNBC</a> brought trading to a standstill as the IEX founder and Lewis argued investors were being scammed. \u201cI believe the markets are rigged and I also think you\u2019re part of the rigging,\u201d Katsuyama told O\u2019Brien. Katsuyama (and Lewis) were guilty of \u201cfalsely accusing literally thousands of people and possibly scaring millions of investors in an effort to promote a business model\u201d, said O\u2019Brien.</p> <p>Much of the disagreement centers on the need \u2013 or not \u2013 for the new exchange\u2019s most famous claim to fame: a 38-mile coiled cable designed as a \u201cspeed bump\u201d to slow down the high-speed transactions that now dominate trading. The cable is designed to stop high-frequency traders (HFTs) using their algorithms to trade in and out of shares at speeds that allow them to take advantage of slower investors \u2013 often those looking to make a long-term bet on a company\u2019s fundamental worth.</p> <p>If you are IEX or its supporters this is tantamount to scalping. IEX\u2019s critics charge it is just how efficient markets operate in the digital age. Either way, it\u2019s all very complicated. And that\u2019s the problem, says Furber. Financial complexity is not only too much for ordinary investors, it\u2019s also too much for those on Wall Street. </p> <p>Furber ran investor relations at Merrill Lynch during the credit crisis. \u201cOne of the things that shaped my view incredibly was that there were a lot of people at that time saying: \u2018You just don\u2019t understand the risk, it\u2019s very complex.\u2019 As a smart, educated person, when people create a lot of complexity and opaqueness, we have to trust our gut. If you can\u2019t explain it, there is something fair about our sense of unease. What we are trying to do is create more transparency and simplicity because that creates better trust.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Whoever you agree with, Wall Street does have a problem. Over the last decade the number of listed companies in the US has halved and the number of companies doing initial public offerings (IPOs) is also in freefall, down from about 300 a year in the 1990s to about 100 a year. Big companies like Albertsons, Bloomberg, Koch Industries are staying private. A new generation of tech giants, Airbnb, Pinterest, Lyft and Uber, are staying private for longer.</p> <p>Part of the reluctance to join the stock markets is because the existing exchanges seem more interested in making money for traders than helping long-term investors maximise their returns or companies raise money, says Furber.</p> <p>\u201cThe market structure we have today has evolved over the last 10 to 15 years and it\u2019s being optimised for different participants than companies and investors,\u201d she says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean everything doesn\u2019t work for them,\u201d she says, but there are \u201cpain points\u201d.</p> <p>NYSE and Nasdaq sell tiers of data and higher-speed services to traders who can use that advantage to make quick returns that are unavailable to those that don\u2019t pay up. IEX won\u2019t do that. </p> <p>\u201cEveryone says they are great in clients service but if your business model operates in a way that doesn\u2019t advantage them, I would question that,\u201d she says. On top of that there are a bunch of fees and rebates that IEX will do away with that she argues create \u201cfinancial incentives that aren\u2019t aligning the broker all the time with their client\u201d.</p> <p>But taking on the incumbent powers will not be easy. Nasdaq and NYSE dominate the listings market \u2013 IEX has about a 2% market share of trading in US equities. The two exchanges have fought hard against allowing IEX to become an exchange and its speed bump, arguing it added unnecessary complexity. But the Securities and Exchange Commission gave IEX the go-ahead last June. One of NYSE\u2019s exchanges, NYSE American, is now offering a speed bump too.</p> <p>\u201cIt validates the problems that exist,\u201d she says. The current big exchanges still drive a significant portion of their revenues from selling tiers of data and tiers of speed. \u201cThe people who can pay the most for that are still the people who can optimise those differences as competitive advantages,\u201d she says.<br></p> <p>\u201cImitation is the sincerest form of flattery,\u201d Furber says with a smile. It can also be the most deadly.</p>",

The government has promised the developers of small modular reactors a slice of a \u00a3250m funding pot in a race to position the UK as the place where the first generation of the power stations should be built. Polling by YouGov, however, believed to be the first survey of public attitudes towards the plants, found that 62% of people would be unhappy living within five miles of one. The poll, commissioned by the climate change charity 10:10, found that only 24% would be unhappy living near an onshore windfarm, which the Conservative party has stymied with tougher planning rules.

    "webTitle": "Airbus launches internal corruption investigation after Guardian expos\u00e9", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Airbus, Europe\u2019s largest aerospace multinational, has launched an internal investigation into possible corruption after the Guardian uncovered a series of questionable financial transactions resulting in an unexplained payment. Hundreds of pages of leaked bank records, internal memos and financial statements reveal that two companies secretly controlled by the aviation giant engaged in transactions involving \u20ac19m (\u00a316.7m), a large part of which was then routed to a mysterious company via a tax haven. Approached for an explanation, Airbus was unable to say who had received the money, or why its control of the two companies was concealed. The multinational, which employs 15,000 people at factories in the UK, said, however, that it was determined to investigate \u201chistoric business practices\u201d and uncover any \u201cimproper practices to ensure that they can never happen again\u201d. The company is already facing corruption investigations in various jurisdictions, including the UK. The Serious Fraud Office announced last year that it had started investigating allegations that the firm had lied about its use of middlemen in order to secure financial backing from the British government. A source close to Airbus said the \u20ac19m transaction is unrelated to any of the existing law enforcement enquiries. The internal investigation was launched after the Guardian asked Airbus if the transactions could constitute money-laundering. One of the firms that knew about the transactions has said it had developed \u201creasonable suspicions\u201d about them and had asked a court to investigate. The scheme hinges on an unexplained purchase of shares between two purportedly independent companies in 2007. Eolia, a Maltese company in the business of retrofitting passenger jets to transport cargo, bought 26% of Avinco Holdings, a Dutch company that sells sells secondhand aircraft and helicopters. Both companies present themselves to the world as independent entities. Neither company\u2019s website mentions any significant external support or backing from other firms. In reality, however, both companies were secretly under Airbus\u2019s effective control. Lawyers for Eolia did not dispute that the firm had operated with secret backing. \u201cAirbus had good, and indeed legitimate, commercial reason to protect its involvement in Eolia,\u201d it aid, but that the reasons were confidential. Avinco Holdings was set up in 2000, principally financed by a UAE businessman, who held 14,999 Avinco shares through a holding company. Airbus owned just one share through a shell company called Yellow Sun Holdings in the tax haven of Cura\u00e7ao, in the Caribbean. A secret agreement, however, granted Airbus the right to buy the UAE businessman out at any time, effectively seizing control of the company. In exchange, the businessman received a generous annual dividend equivalent to 20% of his total investment. According to bank documents, Eolia transferred \u20ac19.4m to the businessman\u2019s holding company on 4 January 2007, with the transfer marked \u201cshare purchase Avinco\u201d. Eight days later, the holding company paid \u20ac16.2m to the bank account of a Panamanian company called Rochade Consultancy, and on the same day Rochade paid an identical sum to yet another company, Malana Holding. It is unclear who owns Malana, or where it is incorporated. The \u20ac16.2m transaction then appears to have been accounted for unusually. The businessman\u2019s holding company records the payment to Rochade as an \u201cinterim dividend\u201d in internal financial documents. It is not clear why Rochade, which is not a shareholder in the holding company, would be entitled to any dividend. Airbus said: \u201cAs part of our ongoing compliance upgrade and investigation into historic business practices within the company, Airbus is determined to uncover any non-compliance and improper practices to ensure that they can never happen again. \u201cAirbus cannot comment on the specific issues raised since other parties involved are in legal dispute over ownership and have their own commercial agendas at play. However, Airbus is investigating the situation thoroughly and none of the individuals referenced currently work for the company. \u201cIf non-compliance is identified, the company will take all actions necessary to root it out, inform the relevant authorities and ensure those responsible are held accountable.\u201d Lawyers for Eolia said it had not decided the price paid for Avinco Holdings, but rather that it was \u201cestablished by Airbus and funded by a loan guaranteed by Airbus\u201d. They said the proposed price was \u201cjustified having regard to the potential commercial benefits indicated by Airbus\u201d. They also said Eolia had suspicions \u201cabout the conduct of third parties in relation to the share purchase\u201d. It was \u201cthose reasonable suspicions\u201d which it had asked a Dutch court to investigate as part of a legal case it had initiated against Avinco Holdings. They denied Eolia had been involved in money-laundering and said that until recently the firm had no knowledge of the \u20ac16.2m payment. Neither the UAE businessman nor Avinco responded to requests for comment. Airbus receives huge financial support from the British, French and German governments to help exports. The British support amounted to \u00a3497m in 2015-16. Until 2012, around 80% of all financial support issued to exporters by the British government was given to Airbus, which has factories in Filton near Bristol and Broughton in North Wales. All support was temporarily suspended in 2016 when the SFO started investigating \u201cirregularities\u201d involving its use of middlemen to secure contracts overseas. France opened an investigation this year. Airbus has for the past few years been quietly terminating the operations of a little-known internal division called the Sales and Marketing Organisation, which spent years developing an international network of consultants to help the company secure high-value overseas contracts. The company\u2019s chief executive, Tom Enders, who arrived in the job in 2012, has pushed for the dissolution of the division, which he reportedly referred to as \u201cbullshit castle\u201d. \u2022 If you would like to pass on information in confidence, you can send a message via the Guardian\u2019s SecureDrop service.

Neither company\u2019s website mentions any significant external support or backing from other firms.</p> <p>In reality, however, both companies were secretly under Airbus\u2019s effective control.<br></p> <p>Lawyers for Eolia did not dispute that the firm had operated with secret backing. \u201cAirbus had good, and indeed legitimate, commercial reason to protect its involvement in Eolia,\u201d it aid, but that the reasons were confidential.<br></p> <p>Avinco Holdings was set up in 2000, principally financed by a UAE businessman, who held 14,999 Avinco shares through a holding company. Airbus owned just one share through a shell company called Yellow Sun Holdings in the tax haven of Cura\u00e7ao, in the Caribbean.</p> <p>A secret agreement, however, granted Airbus the right to buy the UAE businessman out at any time, effectively seizing control of the company. In exchange, the businessman received a generous annual dividend equivalent to 20% of his total investment.<br></p> <p>According to bank documents, Eolia transferred \u20ac19.4m to the businessman\u2019s holding company on 4 January 2007, with the transfer marked \u201cshare purchase Avinco\u201d.</p> <p>Eight days later, the holding company paid \u20ac16.2m to the bank account of a Panamanian company called Rochade Consultancy, and on the same day Rochade paid an identical sum to yet another company, Malana Holding. It is unclear who owns Malana, or where it is incorporated.</p> <p>The \u20ac16.2m transaction then appears to have been accounted for unusually. The businessman\u2019s holding company records the payment to Rochade as an \u201cinterim dividend\u201d in internal financial documents. It is not clear why Rochade, which is not a shareholder in the holding company, would be entitled to any dividend.</p> <p>Airbus said: \u201cAs part of our ongoing compliance upgrade and investigation into historic business practices within the company, Airbus is determined to uncover any non-compliance and improper practices to ensure that they can never happen again.</p> <p>\u201cAirbus cannot comment on the specific issues raised since other parties involved are in legal dispute over ownership and have their own commercial agendas at play. However, Airbus is investigating the situation thoroughly and none of the individuals referenced currently work for the company.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/ng-interactive/2017/mar/17/contact-the-guardian-securely\">Contact the Guardian securely</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf non-compliance is identified, the company will take all actions necessary to root it out, inform the relevant authorities and ensure those responsible are held accountable.\u201d<br></p> <p>Lawyers for Eolia said it had not decided the price paid for Avinco Holdings, but rather that it was \u201cestablished by Airbus and funded by a loan guaranteed by Airbus\u201d.<br></p> <p>They said the proposed price was \u201cjustified having regard to the potential commercial benefits indicated by Airbus\u201d. They also said Eolia had suspicions \u201cabout the conduct of third parties in relation to the share purchase\u201d. It was \u201cthose reasonable suspicions\u201d which it had asked a Dutch court to investigate as part of a legal case it had initiated against Avinco Holdings.</p> <p>They denied Eolia had been involved in money-laundering and said that until recently the firm had no knowledge of the \u20ac16.2m payment. <br></p> <p>Neither the UAE businessman nor Avinco responded to requests for comment.</p> <p>Airbus receives huge financial support from the British, French and German governments to help exports. The British support amounted to \u00a3497m in 2015-16.</p> <p>Until 2012, around 80% of all financial support issued to exporters by the British government was given to Airbus, which has factories <a href=\"http://www.aircraft.airbus.com/company/worldwide-presence/airbus-in-uk/\">in Filton near Bristol and Broughton in North Wales.</a><br></p> <p>All support was temporarily suspended in 2016 when the SFO started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/07/uk-office-launches-inquiry-into-airbus-deals\">investigating \u201cirregularities\u201d involving its</a> use of middlemen to secure contracts overseas. France <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-16/airbus-under-investigation-in-france-over-fraud-allegations\">opened an investigation</a> this year. </p> <p>Airbus has for the past few years been quietly terminating the operations of a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-harvey-drones-idUSKCN1BA1CE\">little-known internal division called the Sales and Marketing Organisation</a>, which spent years developing an international network of consultants to help the company secure high-value overseas contracts. The company\u2019s chief executive, Tom Enders, who arrived in the job in 2012, has <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-harvey-drones-idUSKCN1BA1CE\">pushed for the dissolution of the division</a>, which he reportedly referred to as \u201cbullshit castle\u201d.</p> <p><em>\u2022 If you would like to pass on information in confidence, you can send a message via the Guardian\u2019s SecureDrop service.
