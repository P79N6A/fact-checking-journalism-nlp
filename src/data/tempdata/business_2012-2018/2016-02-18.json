      "bodyText": "Iain Conn and David Brown should compare notes after the day they have just had. The two men are in charge of companies battling it out for the unofficial title of most-hated business in Britain. Conn is the boss of Centrica, owner of British Gas, while Brown is the head of Go-Ahead, which operates the Thameslink, Southern and Southeastern rail franchises through its subsidiary Govia. Both released their financial results on Wednesday and faced a barrage of questions about their treatment of customers. Conn had to explain why British Gas had enjoyed a 31% rise in profits after only cutting prices by 15% during a year when wholesale gas prices had fallen by almost half. Meanwhile, Brown was forced to admit that Go-Ahead\u2019s train services in London need to improve \u2013 as the company reported a 17% rise in statutory pre-tax profits. With delicious timing, the consumer group Which? released a survey on the morning of the results that showed Southeastern and Thameslink have the worst customer satisfaction scores in the country, with Southern not far behind. Shareholders in Centrica and Go-Ahead didn\u2019t seem to care a jot about these issues, with shares in Centrica up 7% and Go-Ahead 6%. However, perhaps that was also because Conn and Brown gave convincing answers. Conn said that British Gas has cut the price of gas in line with the costs it had saved. The reason gas prices for customers have not fallen further, he said, is that only 58% of the price is linked to the value of the commodity, with the rest tied up in tax and regulation. Brown, meanwhile, claimed that delays to trains in London are outside the control of Go-Ahead, pinning the blame squarely on Network Rail and its \u00a36.5bn upgrade of London Bridge station. Go-Ahead is investing in 270 new drivers, 150 carriages and free Wi-Fi, he said. Whether customers end up believing the \u201cit\u2019s not our fault\u201d routine of Conn and Brown could largely be determined by two key reports that are on the way in the next few months. The Competition and Markets Authority will publish its views on the energy market next month, while Nicola Shaw, the chief executive of HS1, will shortly reveal her recommendations about the future of Network Rail. If both government reports find there are flaws in the system then Conn and Brown\u2019s claims will gain a lot more credibility. Asda chief\u2019s poor prediction Never, ever, make a prediction as a chief executive. Unfortunately, Andy Clarke, the boss of Asda, ignored this golden rule about running a major company. Last August Clarke said that Asda has reached its \u201cnadir\u201d after posting a 4.7% fall in sales at established stores for the previous three months. Well, guess what, it wasn\u2019t the nadir. Asda revealed on Thursday that like-for-like sales dropped by 5.8% in the final quarter of 2016. A chief executive has nothing to gain by making predictions like Clarke did. If it had tuned out to be the low point for Asda, then Clarke simply delivered what he said he would. But now that it hasn\u2019t turned out that way, it looks like the Asda boss has not got a grasp on the supermarket chain or the market it operates in. His prediction now looks like it was a desperate attempt to alleviate the pressure on him. Dalton Philips made a similar prediction a couple of years ago when he was boss of Morrisons. A few months later he was out of a job. Running Asda is not like running the other supermarket chains. It is one of the biggest businesses in the UK yet the strings are pulled in Bentonville, Arkansas, the home of its parent company, Walmart. Clarke\u2019s paymasters in the US will be happy that Asda\u2019s profits are stable, despite the slump in sales, which is no mean feat in the tumultuous grocery market. But making predictions that don\u2019t come true never looks good for a chief executive. Roger Burnley, the highly regarded former Sainsbury\u2019s executive, joins Asda this year. Clarke\u2019s largely successful five years could be drawing to a close. Housing divide widens The government\u2019s latest housing survey is a treasure trove of facts about the market. But what stands out is the inequalities that have been allowed to develop. It is extraordinary that there are more households that own their home outright \u2013 33% \u2013 than those that have a mortgage \u2013 30%. This is not a London phenomenon, either \u2013 there are actually more \u201cmortgagors\u201d in London than outright owners, which the survey puts down to the younger population in the UK capital. Others stats that highlight the housing crisis in Britain are that the number of households with children that are renting has increased by 1m in the past decade and the proportion of 25- to 34-year-olds living in the private rental sector has increased from 24% to 46%. Nearly half of private renters \u2013 43% \u2013 do not think they will ever buy a property. More houses need to be built in Britain and more regulation is needed to protect tenants in the rapidly growing private rented sector.",

    "webTitle": "ECB expected to take further action to boost eurozone economy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank is expected to take further action to stimulate the eurozone economy at its next meeting in March. Minutes of the ECB governing council\u2019s last get-together show that without an improvement in the outlook for growth for the rest of the year and 2017, policymakers are ready to cut credit costs further to boost bank lending. A risk that emerging market growth prospects will slow further and volatile markets refuse to recover from their recent lows will send already low inflation across the eurozone tumbling again, it said. The strong hint of more interest rate cuts and a possible increase in the level or scope of the current \u20ac60bn (\u00a346.5bn) a month of quantitative easing (QE), follows comments earlier this week from the ECB boss, Mario Draghi, who said the central bank was \u201cready to do its part\u201d to boost growth and inflation. The governing council said: \u201cAt the start of the new year, downside risks increased again amid heightened uncertainty about emerging market economies\u2019 growth prospects, volatility in financial and commodity markets, and geopolitical risks. \u201cIn this environment, euro area inflation dynamics also continue to be weaker than expected. Therefore, it will be necessary for the governing council to review and possibly reconsider the ECB\u2019s monetary policy stance in early March, when the new staff macroeconomic projections \u2013 also covering the year 2018 \u2013 will become available,\u201d it said. In another indication of its readiness for action, the council added that, in the meantime, \u201cwork will be carried out to ensure that all the technical conditions are in place to make the full range of policy options available for implementation, if needed\u201d. Peter Vanden Houte, an economist at ING Financial Markets, said: \u201cThe bottom line is that the ECB looks ready to act again in March. Since the January meeting the economic environment has deteriorated and financial stress has barely softened.\u201d But Vanden Houte said there was a risk the bank would drown the eurozone with extra central bank funds. \u201cThe ECB is starting to hit the boundaries of what monetary policy can achieve. The current medicine of negative interest rates and QE seems to have lost its magic and the risk is now that an overdose might even have the opposite effect than what the ECB is aiming for. Too much of a good thing might be a bad thing, also in monetary policy. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said he expected the ECB to trim its deposit rate by a further 10 basis points to -0.40% at its March meeting and step up its monthly purchase of assets, perhaps by \u20ac20bn-30bn from the current level of \u20ac60bn. \u201cOf course, there is appreciable German-led opposition within the governing council to more QE in particular, so just how much stimulus the ECB delivers in March could yet depend on how oil prices and inflation expectations develop over the next few weeks, and whether global economic uncertainties and financial market turmoil show any signs of easing,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "As you approach the Ring \u2013 the circular trading floor of the London Metal Exchange \u2013 a low murmur crescendoes into a bewildering cacophony. This is where the bulk of the world\u2019s industrial metals are traded, using the traditional \u2018open-outcry\u2019 method that makes the LME unique in the City. It is the first day of trading at LME\u2019s new headquarters and dealers are perched on padded red leather seats in the centre of the circle, shouting bids and offers on contracts for the sale of metals such as copper, zinc and aluminium. Behind them stand the clerks, making frenetic hand gestures known as tic-tacs to convey information about amounts, prices and types of metal without adding to the noise. At the back, often clutching a telephone to each ear, are the account executives, who pass instructions and information to and from clients buying or selling metals. All of the deals happen during five-minute trading windows, each for a different metal. As the window for aluminium opens, very little happens. But as the clock ticks down to the end of the five-minute window, the noise level rises and the entire room seems to be arguing with itself, barking prices and amounts seemingly at random. Everyone is trying to make themselves heard, with some screaming at the top of their lungs to do the best job for their clients - the companies and investors who buy and sell metals. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet today,\u201d says Peter Childs, the head of trading operations. Suddenly, a buzzer sounds to signal the end of the session and the competitive whirlwind gives way to a cordial atmosphere of camaraderie. Anywhere else, this sort of to-do would seem like the total breakdown of law and order but at the London Metal Exchange, this is business as usual. This is the first day of open-outcry trading at the LME\u2019s shiny new headquarters in Moorgate, London, the exchange\u2019s fourth home since it was established above a hat shop in Lombard Street in 1877. Despite anxiety among veteran Ring dealers \u2013 many of whom feared that the circular floor would be abandoned in favour of electronic trading \u2013 the LME\u2019s heritage is going strong. It will need to draw on that strength. Due to the global economic slowdown, the volume of trading on the LME, and therefore its income, has been hit. Its chief executive Garry Jones acknowledges that times are tough but says the LME is \u201cin it for the long term and we\u2019ll ride the ups and the downs\u201d. To offset the metals malaise, the LME is planning to broaden out its market to include transactions related to metals. It is also looking for new member companies, while parent company HKEX plans to start a new trading platform in mainland China, building on the overall strength of the group. Whatever comes next, the Ring looks set to endure for several years yet, providing a rare glimpse into an idiosyncratic world that is somehow still alive in the digital age.",

From Friday, the retailer is to defy logic by only selling straight versions of the breakfast pastries, the French name of which translates as crescent. It claims that demand for the traditionally curved breakfast snacks has fallen and British consumers now prefer straight ones due to their optimised \u201cspreadability factor\u201d and a sense that they are somehow more sophisticated. Harry Jones, Tesco\u2019s croissant buyer, said: \u201cAfter demand for crescent shaped croissants started falling, we spoke to our customers and nearly 75% of them told us that they preferred straight ones. \u201cAt the heart of the move away from curved croissants is the spreadability factor. The majority of shoppers find it easier to spread jam, or their preferred filling, on a straighter shape with a single sweeping motion. \u201cWith the crescent shaped croissants, it\u2019s more fiddly and most people can take up to three attempts to achieve perfect coverage, which increases the potential for accidents involving sticky fingers and tables,\u201d he said. The supermarket said the change is part of a wider range of improvements it is making to key bakery products, including putting more chocolate chips in its own brand brioche and creamier ganache in its chocolate cakes. The owner of one London French bakery viewed the change with scepticism. Michelle Wade, whose Maison Bertaux in Soho is a top destination for croissant connoisseurs, said the pastries ought to be curved until the tips touch. \u201cThey never look like that at Tesco,\u201d she said. Maison Bertaux\u2019s croissants \u201care beautifully curved\u201d, Wade said. \u201cBut, mind you, the thing is that croissants always come out a lot of different shapes because they are hand rolled.\u201d \u201cAnyway it\u2019s good for us because it makes our products more original,\u201d she added. According to legend, the predecessor of the modern croissant was invented in Austria in the 17th century to celebrate the defeat of the Turkish empire at the siege of Vienna, with the shape representing the Islamic crescent. The tale, though probably apocryphal, reportedly led to the snack being banned by Islamic fundamentalists in Syria. Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose confirmed they sold both curved and straight croissants, and had no plans to discontinue either type. \u201cThe easiest way to enjoy a curved croissant is to do it the French way \u2013 by dunking it into a dollop of jam,\u201d a Waitrose spokeswoman said.",

    "webTitle": "Asda suffers worst ever quarterly sales fall", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Asda\u2019s prolonged sales slump has reached a new record low after a poor performance over Christmas. Andy Clarke, the chief executive of the UK\u2019s third-largest supermarket, denied the retailer was in crisis as sales at established stores fell 5.8% in the 13 weeks to 1 January, compared with a 4.5% decline in the previous quarter and a 4.7% slide before that \u2013 previously the worst performance in Asda\u2019s 50-year history. The sixth consecutive quarter of declining sales confirms Asda endured the worst sales performance of all the major grocers over Christmas as it lost out to discounters Aldi and Lidl as well as major rivals Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s. Clarke, who previously described the 4.7% sales slide as a \u201cnadir\u201d for Asda, admitted that the supermarket\u2019s sales performance had been worse than expected. But he insisted Asda had enjoyed a successful Christmas because it had met its strategic objectives in reducing discounting, keeping profits stable and selling out its seasonal products. \u201cThis is a business in financial control and in charge of the decisions we are making not a business in crisis,\u201d Clarke said. He warned that Asda was likely to see continuing falls in underlying sales this year at it steps up price cuts and steers clear of heavy discounts in its bid to win over shoppers. Clarke added: \u201cShort-term tactics taken by some businesses are going to tempt some shoppers to take advantage of those [offers] but we have got a long term sustainable strategy of investing in price and executing [improvements in stores].\u201d The Asda boss said the grocery market had become increasingly challenging in the past three months of 2015 as rivals had stepped up promotional activity. Asda lost customers as it withdrew from the Black Friday discounting frenzy in November and was affected by widespread price cuts for clothing and alcohol by rivals. Other major supermarkets enjoyed a better than expected performance, thanks to soaring sales of sparkling wine, beer and gin at bargain prices. About 2 percentage points of Asda\u2019s fall in sales was the result of its own price cuts, a further 0.4 percentage points were due to withdrawing from Black Friday and much of the rest down to shoppers choosing to buy elsewhere. Clarke said Asda would not be getting involved in Black Friday this year as he believed \u201cthe customer is looking for broader appeal than one day of excitement\u201d. \u201cCompetition in our sector has been fierce and our market share has come under pressure. In that context, our results for the year have been commendably stable, balancing investment in our customers with disciplined financial management in a period when many of our competitors have suffered severe falls in profitability,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the long run we will win in this market. The fourth quarter was softer than we thought but that was about change in the market not about our strategy.\u201d The poor sales performance ramps up pressure on the Asda boss ahead of the arrival of Roger Burnley, the Sainsbury\u2019s director, in October. Burnley is widely seen as a successor to Clarke, but the timing of the likely handover is not yet clear. For now, Asda is to plough ahead with further price cuts as part of a plan to invest \u00a3500m this year. It has launched a new advertising slogan \u2013 \u201cPocket More\u201d \u2013 under which it said it would ensure it had the lowest price on a further 1,600 product lines compared to Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons. \u201cWe will continue to invest in pricing. We have a clear ambition to narrow the price gap to the discounters to 5%,\u201d he said. According to Clarke, Asda was currently about 11% more expensive than the discounters and 8% cheaper than its traditional rivals. Two years ago Asda was 23% more expensive than the discounters, according to Clarke. The cuts will be supported by \u00a3250m worth of productivity improvements and cost cuts this year. Asda is in talks with suppliers in a bid to get better deals and persuade them to \u201cinvest\u201d millions of pounds in promotional activity and other measures to help win back shoppers. It has also cut 200 jobs at head office and is considering axing up to 1,000 jobs in stores, as well as staff perks such as free tea and toast as Clarke seeks the funds to take on the discounters on price. George Scott, senior analyst at consultancy Verdict Retail, said Asda\u2019s latest slide in sales showed the retailer had not done enough to broaden its appeal beyond price in the face of heavy competition from Aldi and Lidl. \u201cAway from price, Asda has a relatively weak reputation for quality, with its more upmarket Extra Special label needing greater product coverage and marketing communications,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "MPs have won access to documents covering controversial and secretive trade talks between Brussels and Washington, but can only take a pencil and paper into the room where the files can be viewed. Confidentiality rules mean no electronic devices \u2013 including phones, tablet and laptop computers, or cameras \u2013 are allowed in the room at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) in Westminster. This is fuelling concerns about a \u201ccloak of secrecy\u201d surrounding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations between the EU and the US government. UK business minister Anna Soubry agreed to provide the room in BIS\u2019s offices on the condition that MPs keep the TTIP documents private. Soubry said pressure on Brussels officials from EU governments had won the concession, but the department was obliged to maintain secrecy. Green MP Caroline Lucas said that access to documents on \u201cthis hugely significant trade deal\u201d was necessary before UK parliamentarians were asked to vote on it. \u201cBut the bad news is that a cloak of secrecy still surrounds TTIP. If the same rules apply here in the UK as they do in Brussels, which is what the minister is implying, then MPs will be bound by a confidentiality agreement if they want to see the text,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cThis opaque process, which shuts citizens out of this crucial debate, is profoundly undemocratic.\u201d A BIS spokesperson said: \u201cSimilar restrictions will apply to those accessing the room as apply to both MEPs and UK officials using existing reading rooms in Brussels. Due to the sensitive nature of these classified documents, all those who are granted access to them are expected to handle and protect them appropriately.\u201d MEPs are also only permitted to view TTIP documents in a secluded room and make notes with pencil and paper. A spokeswoman for the European parliament said: \u201cAlthough note-taking is normally not allowed when consulting classified information, in this case the commission has agreed MEPs can take handwritten notes when consulting the TTIP documents.\u201d The spokeswoman added that an \u201cunprecedented number of documents\u201d had so far been declassified in a \u201ctransparency initiative\u201d. The next round of TTIP talks will begin next week in Brussels between European trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m and her US counterpart, trade representative Michael Froman. Both sides said progress had been made at a week-long meeting in Miami last year and they hoped to get closer to a fully fledged trade deal this year. The aim of the deal is to lower trade tariffs and harmonise regulations covering thousands of goods and services, including financial services. Brussels, which claims it has consulted widely during the talks, estimates that tens of billions of euros of extra trade could flow across the Atlantic after a deal. But TTIP has come under fire for threatening public services and giving powers to corporations outside individual nations\u2019 domestic court systems. A plan to include a separate tribunal system that would allow private companies to settle disputes has caused alarm after a series of incidents in other trade agreements that resulted in multinational companies suing governments. In the most high-profile case, tobacco company Philip Morris took the Australian government to an investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) tribunal when the Canberra parliament agreed to enforce plain cigarette packaging. Earlier this week, anti-TTIP campaigners said that ISDS would also allow corporations to challenge tax changes that hit their profits. A report published by Global Justice Now and the Transnational Institute warns that a deal \u201cwould massively increase the ability of corporations to sue member states of the EU over measures such as windfall taxes on exceptional profits, or use of taxation as a policy instrument\u201d. Nick Dearden, the director of Global Justice Now, said: \u201cDespite the enormous public outcry over companies like Google and Amazon paying ridiculously small amounts of tax in the UK, the government is trying to sign us up to a trade deal that could effectively prevent us from bringing about laws that could address tax injustice. \u201cThe ability to enact effective and fair tax systems to finance vital public services is one of the defining features of sovereignty. The fact that multinational companies would be able to challenge and undermine that under TTIP is testament to the terrifying extent of the corporate grab embedded in this toxic trade deal.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Waltons, already the wealthiest family in the US with an estimated $149bn fortune, added a further $5bn last year from dividends and share buybacks at Walmart. The Walton family collectively owns just over half of Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer which on Thursday reported it made revenues of $482bn in the year to the end of January. That is more than Austria, Thailand or the United Arab Emirates make in gross domestic product (GDP) a year, according to World Bank statistics. Walmart disclosed its earnings to its shareholders by paying out $6.3bn in dividends and repurchasing $4.1bn worth of shares. The Waltons own nearly 54% of Walmart so their share is worth $5.6bn. The Waltons, descendants of Sam Walton, who founded Walmart as a single store in Arkansas in 1962, are the richest family in the US, according to Forbes with a net worth of $149bn. The Walton fortune is almost twice as much as the country\u2019s second-richest family the Kochs with $86bn. After a long battle with its army of more than a million workers, Walmart will from Monday increase its pay to a minimum of $10 an hour. However, new workers will still receive $9 an hour until they have completed in-house training. Walmart said the increases would take average full-time workers\u2019 wages to $13.38 an hour and part-time staff to $10.58. Walmart described the pay hike as \u201cone of the largest single-day, private-sector pay increases ever\u201d. But unions said many Walmart workers still won\u2019t be making enough money to support their families. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to find a unicorn than a Walmart worker who has gotten a meaningful raise, or hasn\u2019t had their hours cut,\u201d Jessica Levin, spokeswoman of the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, which is campaigning for a $15-an-hour living wage, said. \u201cAmerica\u2019s hard-working families expect better from a company that makes billions in profit a year.\u201d The inequity of the Waltons\u2019 wealth compared to the hardship experienced by Walmart\u2019s army of workers has become a talking point in the race for the White House in 2016. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who is taking on Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, said it was unacceptable that the Waltons have more wealth than the bottom 40% of Americans. \u201cToday Walmart is the largest private sector employer in America,\u201d Sanders said in campaign speech in New Hampshire earlier this month. \u201cYet many, many of their employees are forced to go on food stamps, Medicaid and subsidized housing that you pay for through your taxes because the Walton family refuses to pay their workers a living wage.\u201d Sanders said the Waltons were benefiting from \u201cthe rigged economy\u201d in which \u201cthe middle class pays to subsidize the wealthiest family in this country\u201d. \u201cI say to the Walton family, get off of welfare.

Most European stock markets are trading higher, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.5%, France\u2019s CAC 0.8% ahead, and Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.9%. The price of Brent crude has climbed 2.6% to $35.37 a barrel today. A notable exception is the FTSE 100 index in London, which has fallen more than 50 points to 5979.15, a fall of 0.85%. With this, we are closing up for the day. Thank you for all your comments. We will be back tomorrow. There\u2019s been a spate of job loss announcements by major British-based companies in the past fortnight or so, with Centrica today and Bombardier yesterday the latest companies to talk about job cuts. We\u2019ve done a round-up of companies axeing jobs in the UK, and looked at what it means for the wider economy. Allan Monks, UK economist at JPMorgan Chase, said: The one thing everyone is looking for at the moment is a sign that there is a slide in business sentiment. In the manufacturing sector in particular the trend doesn\u2019t look encouraging.\u201d Here\u2019s some reaction to the Asda sales slump, which confirmed its position as the worst-performing of the Big Four supermarkets over the Christmas period, amid a fierce price war. George Scott, senior analyst at Verdict Retail, has looked at the chain\u2019s problems in detail. Asda\u2019s now prolonged story of negative like-for-like sales shows that it has not done enough to broaden its appeal beyond price. Indeed news this week that it has asked suppliers for cash contributions to help cover costs of promotions reflects its predicament. Away from price, Asda has a relatively weak reputation for quality, with its more upmarket Extra Special label needing greater product coverage and marketing communications. While its more functional instore experience sits well with its traditional shoppers, it also needs to do more to improve its staffing levels, adding reasons to visit, if it is to claw back ground from the discounters \u2013 Tesco has been leading by example on this front with good effect.\u201d He noted that Asda had announced some positive steps for this year, including the modernisation of 95 large stores, mostly around layout and merchandising. It also plans to further simplify its head office structure,and has joined the EMD European supermarket alliance, which will give it added buying power and allow it compete more strongly on price. If it is to improve its outlook Asda however needs to evolve its mainstay food positioning. Indeed its George fashion and home label, which has been performing strongly for some time, has exactly the type of balanced consideration of price and quality which that it needs to aim for in food.\u201d Asda has reported a sharp fall in sales over Christmas as it failed to stem an exodus of shoppers to German discount chains Aldi and Lidl. The UK supermarket chain, owned by US retail giant Wal-mart, posted a 5.8% decline in like-for-like sales in the 13 weeks to 1 January, marking the sixth quarter of falling sales. It is a steeper fall than the 4.5% and 4.7% declines seen in the previous two quarters. However, the company stressed that profitability in the quarter remained stable. European shares have hit a two-week high, helped by gains in technology shares led by France\u2019s Capgemini which reported a 20% rise in full-year profits. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.7% to 1304.31. The FTSE 100 index in London is still down, however. It has slipped 24 points or 0.4%, but is holding above the 6000 mark at 6006.36. The minutes of the European Central Bank\u2019s January meeting are out. They show that policymakers thought that the eurozone\u2019s modest recovery was continuing but flagged up rising risks to the growth outlook. They also pointed to weak wage growth and other signs that low energy prices could feed through into the price of other goods and services \u2013 so-called second-round effects that could keep inflation low. The ECB\u2019s governing council left interest rates unchanged at the meeting, but its president Mario Draghi dropped heavy hints that it could ease policy at the next meeting on 10 March. The minutes said: While incoming information had confirmed the ongoing moderate recovery... downside risks had increased again amid heightened uncertainty about the growth prospects of emerging market economies, volatility in the financial and commodity markets and geopolitical risks. Inflation had continued to be weaker than expected, mainly owing to the renewed sharp fall in oil prices, but also to persistently subdued underlying price pressures. Weaker than anticipated growth in wages, in conjunction with declining inflation expectations, could also signal increased risks of second-round effects. After a bit of a wobble earlier on, the rally on European stock markets continues, underpinned by rising oil prices. London\u2019s leading share index, the FTSE 100, is the only exception, trading down 0.3% or 16 points at 6015.05. Germany\u2019s Dax is 1.6% ahead, France\u2019s CAC has gained 0.8% while Spain\u2019s Ibex and Italy\u2019s FTSE Mib are just over 1% higher. Crude oil prices are rising again, adding to yesterday\u2019s 7% leap. Brent crude is up 2.1% at $35.24 a barrel after encouraging comments from Iraq\u2019s oil minister. He said talks would continue between Opec and non-Opec members about how to shore up oil prices, and that producers needed to find a way of restoring \u201cnormal\u201d prices. The Paris-based OECD think tank has called for less austerity and more public investment as it cut its growth forecasts. And Britain\u2019s productivity gap with other major economies has widened to the worst level since records began in 1991. Here is some reaction to the UK\u2019s poor productivity figures. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: For all the good news on rising employment, the UK is still not creating enough quality jobs. The yawning productivity gap between us and other countries shows how much room there is for us to do better.\u201d Workplace management firm Condeco Software is calling for more flexible working, saying the impact on productivity is well-documented. There is increased need to take the potential of flexible working seriously. In research by Vodafone, which surveyed 8,000 global employers and employees, 83% said they had seen an improvement in productivity after introducing flexible working arrangements. In addition, 61% of respondents said profits had increased. This latest report adds to research suggesting that UK businesses could make productivity gains of \u00a38.1bn by optimising flexible working. Oil prices are pushing higher again, with Brent crude rising 2.6% to $35.39 a barrel, after comments from Iraq\u2019s oil minister. Adel Abdul Mahdi said talks would continue between Opec and non-Opec members about how to shore up oil prices, a day after a meeting aimed at reaching a global pact to freeze production ended inconclusively. In his first public comments since the meeting between oil ministers from Iran, Iraq, Qatar and Venezuela in Tehran yesterday, the Iraqi oil minister said producers needed to find a way of restoring \u201cnormal\u201d prices and that rapprochement between the oil cartel and non-Opec members was a step in the right direction. Two of the world\u2019s biggest exporters \u2013 Opec leader Saudi Arabia and Russia, which is not a member of the cartel \u2013 reached a surprise compromise deal earlier this week to freeze output at January levels if other producers join in. A lot hinges on Iran, whose oil minister praised the plan yesterday \u2013 but did not commit to reining in the country\u2019s own growing output. We\u2019ve long known that despite decent economic growth, UK productivity growth isn\u2019t great (why, nobody really knows - it\u2019s called the productivity puzzle). Official figures now show that productivity gap between Britain and other G-7 countries has widened to the biggest since records began in 1991. The figures underscore the challenge for the chancellor, George Osborne, who has made raising the UK\u2019s poor productivity growth a priority. In 2014, output per hour in the UK was 18 percentage points below the average for the rest of the G-7 economies, final figures from the Office for National Statistics showed this morning. For the first time, the ONS has published international comparisons of productivity at a sectoral level. The results show that UK labour productivity trails behind the US in all sub-sectors and particularly in manufacturing. In financial services, the UK\u2019s comparative productivity has worsened sharply since 2009 and trails France and Italy as well as the US. The UK was 5% more productive than Germany but 6% less productive than France, and 22% less productive than the US between 2010 and 2014. When looking at manufacturing, the UK was 24% less productive than Germany, 18% behind France and 45% less productive than the USA. One of the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governors, Jon Cunliffe, said this morning that the recent shift in market expectations regarding the timing of the first interest rate hike was not justified. A month ago, financial markets were expecting the first rate hike from the Bank in 2017, but are now pricing in a rise in the second quarter of 2019. Cunliffe said at an event in Brussels held by the Swiss Finance Council: I can\u2019t see anything in the economic news that would lead to a shift like that.\u201d The OECD has called for its rich-country members to ease up on austerity and collectively agree to spend more on infrastructure projects to boost flagging growth. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development expressed concern about the state of the global economy as it cut growth forecasts made three months ago and warned that low interest rates and money creation by central banks were no longer enough for a lasting recovery. Marking the latest stage in its shift away from support for austerity, the OECD criticised the over-reliance on monetary policy \u2013 low interest rates and the money-creation process known as quantitative easing \u2013 and urged that countries adopt a more balanced approach. The OECD has in the past supported the deficit-reduction programme taken by the UK chancellor, George Osborne, but believes Britain should now join with other countries in spending more on public investment. You can read the full story here. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at online trading firm IG, has sent us his thoughts on the markets. Early trading in Europe has seen markets creep higher with levels of enthusiasm normally shown by teenagers tidying their rooms. The FTSE has an added disadvantage as Shell, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca all go ex-dividend, knocking 24 points off the index. The importance of David Cameron\u2019s negotiations at the EU summit can\u2019t be underestimated, as a failure to get a resolution at this meeting will almost certainly derail a Brexit referendum in June. The IG Brexit binary still indicates a 67% chance that the UK will vote to remain in the EU. Oil continues to levitate just above the $30 level as traders gauge how likely it is that major oil producers will adhere to the new production cap. It was the turn of Iran and Iraq to discuss production levels yesterday, and although Iran made all the right noises it simultaneously failed to make any promises. Considering it has only just managed to get off an oil embargo list, Iran could be forgiven for being a little reluctant to reduce capacity.\u201d Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe said this morning he hopes the Bank of Japan\u2019s move to negative interest rates will support consumer spending and investment. Speaking at a meeting of government ministers, he added that the government is monitoring moves in financial markets and hopes to cooperate with G-7 countries as needed. London\u2019s leading share index, the FTSE 100, is still down 0.6%, suffering under the weight of the commodity sector. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says: The FTSE started the day suffering under the weight of its commodity sector. The miners appear to be falling back to the levels they rose from yesterday, arguably harmed by the fact that, whilst at its highest point since last September the Chinese inflation figures from the early hours of the day underperformed the 1.9% expected by analysts, coming in at 1.8%. Add onto that the slowing momentum of Brent Crude and the oil stocks joined in with the losses, leaving the FTSE with little wiggle room this Thursday. This is despite strong gains from British Gas owner Centrica, up 3.8% to 201.5p, the top riser on the FTSE. Defence contractor BAE Systems was up 2% earlier and is now trading 0.8% higher at 503.5p. Campbell notes: Though Centrica\u2019s better than expected 12% fall in yearly adjusted operating profit to \u00a31.5bn was joined by a 5% fall in revenue to \u00a328bn AND a cut dividend, British Gas\u2019 31% surge in profit to \u00a3574m appeared to be enough for investors, the utility company rising by 3.5% to hit the \u00a32 mark for the first time since the start of February. And whilst not as explosive as rival Rolls-Royce\u2019s gains last Friday, BAE Systems will likely be pleased with its 2% rise this Thursday, that jump seeing the defence and aerospace firm re-cross the \u00a35 mark after revealing a 2% increase in its final dividend and a \u00a31.3bn increase in sales to \u00a317.9bn, the latter aided by a Saudi Arabian aircraft splurge. The United Arab Emirates\u2019 energy minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei has given verbal support to plans by Russia and Saudi Arabia to cap production. He said this morning that oil prices are \u201cnot suitable\u201d and will force producers to freeze their output. State news agency WAM quoted him as saying: Current prices are not suitable... and will force producers to hold production levels and limit investments in the higher cost oil [production].\u201d Amazon said it would open a new 1m sq ft fulfillment centre in in Coalville, Leicestershire, creating 500 new jobs over three years, as it expands aggressively in the UK and the rest of Europe. The company has started recruiting for a range of positions, from operations managers to engineers, HR and IT roles. The centre will open in the autumn. The move forms part of plans to hire 2,500 people for permanent roles in the UK this year. The online giant is also pushing ahead with plans for \u201chundreds\u201d of bookshops in the US, after opening its first bookshop in Seattle recently. Oil prices continue to climb, after Iran welcomed plans by Russia and Saudi Arabia to cap production, although analysts noted that the move would not lead to any output cuts and Tehran did not commit to reining in its own growing output. The price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, jumped 7% yesterday. Today, Brent rose more than 1% in early London trading but is now flat at $34.52 a barrel. Stock markets have got off to a cautious start: The FTSE 100 index is down nearly 40 points, or 0.6%, at 5992.86. The Dax in Frankfurt is 0.15% ahead while the CAC in Paris has edged up 0.1%. Disappointing corporate results are weighing on European stocks. Shares in food giant Nestl\u00e9 dropped more than 4% after sales missed forecasts and it admitted it was struggling to raise its prices. It has been hit by the slowdown in emerging markets, and a recall of its popular Maggi noodles in India. Belgian bank and insurance group KBC also saw its shares fall by 4% after it took an impairment on its operations in Bulgaria and Slovakia. On the agenda today, a report on the state of the global economy from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is out at 10.00 GMT. The number of properties in Britain worth \u00a31m or more is set to more than triple by 2030, widening the gap between the housing haves and have-nots, according to a new report. Less than half a million homes in the UK are currently valued at \u00a31m-plus, but a study by high street lender Santander claims this number will rise to more than 1.6m in the next 15 years. You can read the report on property millionaires here (PDF). Santander said: By 2030 the UK will be even more starkly divided into the housing wealthy and the housing poor than it is now.\u201d But Centrica, Britain\u2019s biggest energy supplier, also said adjusted pretax profits for the group had fallen to \u00a31.1bn in 2015 from \u00a31.3bn the previous year, as the falling oil price took its toll. It is axeing 1,000 jobs this year, as part of 4,000 cutbacks by 2020 that were announced last year. The company is also cutting back investments further, and reduced its dividend by 30% to 12p a share. Following the collapse in wholesale prices, it booked charges of \u00a32.4bn on oil and gas assets and power stations. Here is the full story. On the corporate front, British Gas owner Centrica has reported a leap in annual profits of 31%, to \u00a3574m, at its residential supply business. Our energy editor, Terry Macalister, reports: The soaring profit comes amid growing calls for the big six suppliers to cut their power bills for customers in line with wholesale prices. Fuel Poverty Action, a campaign group for those struggling to pay their energy bills, said the figures showed the company was profiteering at the expense of hard-pressed consumers. \u201cIt is absolutely sickening that British Gas has made bumper profits in a year when there were more winter deaths than at any time this century. We have seen British Gas mercilessly hound hard-up customers even when bills are in dispute,\u201d said a spokeswoman, Ruth London. Meanwhile, Eurotunnel is claiming \u20ac29m (\u00a323m) from the British and French governments for lost revenue caused by refugees trying to get from Calais to the UK. You can read the full story here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets have had a decent run this week, after all the recent turmoil. London\u2019s leading share index, the FTSE 100, posted four consecutive daily gains for the first time this year, its best run since November. The gains have come on the back of a recovery in oil prices, which have been boosted by support from Iran for a plan put forward by Saudi Arabia and Russia to freeze production. Brent crude is now trading at $34.73, up 0.7% on the day. Asian stock markets rose strongly after the minutes of the last US Federal Reserve meeting indicated caution among policymakers regarding the next interest rate hike. Japan\u2019s Nikkei finished 2.3% higher at 16,196.80 while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 2.1% to 19,328.91. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said the minutes showed Fed policymakers are playing for time. Despite the increased uncertainty, [Fed] officials seemed content to wait and see whether the tightening of financial conditions was sustained and, if so, whether it would negatively impact on GDP growth. In the immediate aftermath of that January meeting financial conditions tightened even further, with equity prices tumbling and riskier corporate bond spreads widening. As it stands now, however, the S&amp;P 500 is back at its late January level, the dollar has weakened and, even though junk bond yields have increased, investment-grade corporate bond yields and mortgage rates have actually fallen. The incoming economic data have also improved, with employment, retail sales and manufacturing output recording solid gains in January. The chances of a March rate hike are still very slim, particularly in light of the most recent comments from Fed officials, but we think the Fed will resume hiking interest rates later this year. By the middle of this year, fears of a collapse in both China and the US should have faded and rising domestic price pressures will be even harder to ignore. We expect the fed funds rate to end this year at between 1.00% and 1.25%.\u201d",

The incoming economic data have also improved, with employment, retail sales and manufacturing output recording solid gains in January.</p> <p><strong>The chances of a March rate hike are still very slim, particularly in light of the most recent comments from Fed officials, but we think the Fed will resume hiking interest rates later this year.</strong> By the middle of this year, fears of a collapse in both China and the US should have faded and rising domestic price pressures will be even harder to ignore. We expect the fed funds rate to end this year at between 1.00% and 1.25%.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-18T07:52:38.894Z\">at 7.52am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

BAE Systems said it expected earnings to rise between 5-10% in 2016 due to higher military budgets and more work on cyber security.

Just over a third of the group\u2019s sales come from the US, while Saudi Arabia accounts for a fifth of sales, about the same level as Britain.

      "bodyText": "Major UK-based companies have announced tens of thousands of job losses that are expected to ripple through the economy in the coming months, casting a shadow over Britain\u2019s recovery. Affecting vast areas of the UK economy \u2013 from factories to the high street, banking, media and energy \u2013 the job losses announced in the past fortnight coincided with another wave of panic selling on stock markets and fears of a further global recession. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development expressed concern on Thursday about the state of the global economy. It cut growth forecasts made three months ago and called on its members, including Britain, to ease up on austerity. Two of the UK\u2019s biggest lenders, Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays, along with Credit Suisse, are laying off workers in the UK. BP and Shell have been prompted to cut jobs because of the collapse in crude prices, which has hit oil companies hard. And the British Gas owner, Centrica, reiterated on Thursday that it is to axe 1,000 jobs in the UK this year, as part of 4,000 job cuts by 2020. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: \u201cThese are all fairly highly paid roles \u2026 You\u2019ve got to think that over the next six months you\u2019re going to see some trickle-down effect. A lot of the recovery in the UK has been consumption based, so that ultimately is going to hit consumption rates.\u201d George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said the loss of highly paid City jobs, along with the new stamp duty surcharge on second homes from April, was likely to affect the buy-to-let market and the wider housing market. \u201cWe have a list of 10 reasons why we are nervous about London house prices,\u201d he said. \u201cI imagine a lot of people who work in the financial services industry own buy-to-let property. It could have a knock-on effect on the buy-to-let market and the property market as a whole.\u201d The woes spread far and wide. Britain\u2019s steel industry, in which 5,000 workers have lost their jobs since last summer, has appealed to the government for emergency assistance. Tata, which owns the remnants of British Steel, announced 1,050 job cuts last month. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: \u201cThe UK labour market is becoming more polarised by the day. The loss of important middle-income jobs, in industries such as steel, should concern us all.\u201d Weak wage growth is also a problem. \u201cWhile employment rates may have recovered, real wages are still way below their pre-recession level,\u201d O\u2019Grady added, calling on the government to commit to an \u201cactive industrial strategy\u201d. Wages excluding bonuses had risen by 2% year-on-year at the end of 2015 \u2013 half the pre-crisis average of about 4%, according to the latest official figures published on Wednesday. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that bankers stood a better chance of finding new employment compared with people in engineering roles. \u201cThe biggest effect will be in areas, particularly manufacturing, where it is very difficult for the people that are affected to redeploy their skills because there aren\u2019t similar recruiters.\u201d The headline job losses will be spread out over a period of time, so economists are sceptical that they will push up the UK unemployment rate, which is currently 5.1%. Employment has been growing strongly, with more than half a million more people in work in the final quarter of 2015 than a year earlier; the figure has been boosted by migration and by older people remaining in the workforce for longer. Amazon, for example, is hiring in the UK and the rest of Europe: the online retailer plans to create more than 2,500 permanent jobs across Britain this year. But many high street retailers are struggling, and supermarkets are also cutting back as a fierce price war shows no sign of abating.",

    "webTitle": "Negative interest rates: what you need to know", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "What are negative interest rates? Normally savers earn interest when they deposit their money in banks. Similarly, commercial banks that lodge money with central banks receive interest for doing so. Negative interest rates turn this arrangement on its head. Savers have to pay banks for holding their money and central banks penalise banks for depositing cash with them. Why are we talking about them? Because central banks are increasingly using them to boost growth and raise the level of inflation. At present, it is really only commercial banks that are being charged negative interest rates but there is a possibility, if things get worse, that they will affect members of the public as well. What\u2019s the rationale for negative rates? The idea is that negative interest rates provide banks with an incentive to lend money rather than to hoard it. The same would apply to members of the public, who would be encouraged to spend rather than save. Isn\u2019t this unusual? It is, but it reflects the low level of inflation across the global economy despite seven years of economic recovery. In the past, interest rates would have been strongly positive by this point. Japan has had the longest experience with low inflation and deflation, and on Tuesday the Bank of Japan introduced negative interest rates. It is charging banks 0.1% for their excess deposits. Is Japan the first country to go negative? In recent history, the Swedes were first. Between July 2009 and September 2010 Sweden cut the deposit rate to -0.25% in an attempt to fend off the deep recession that followed the 2008 banking crash and global financial crisis. It reintroduced them in July 2014 and the deposit rate is currently -1.25%. Sweden\u2019s central bank became the first country to lend at a negative rate when in February 2015 it announced a negative repo rate \u2013 its main lending rate to commercial banks. Economists point out that this is largely a technicality because of the way its banking system operates. Switzerland introduced a negative rate in December 2014. However, it has experimented with them in the past; in 1972 it put a 2% penalty charge on deposits by non-residents. Denmark tried to reduce the pressure on its currentcy in July 2012 by having a negative deposit rate between July 2012 and April 2014. After a period of being back in positive territory, it imposed a -0.75% rate on certificates of deposit from September 2014. Eurozone: the 19 countries in the single currency area have had negative rates since June 2014. The deposit rate was set at -0.1% in June 2014 and then cut to -0.2% and to -0.3% in December 2015. Is anyone else thinking about it? The eurozone countries could yet get a deeper negative rate after the European Central Bank meets next month. Analysts at Morgan Stanley note that even the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is \u201cstarting to sound more open to the idea\u201d. There is even some chatter that the Bank of England could end up with negative rates, or at least cut them from the historic low of 0.5% \u2013 an idea raised by its chief economist Andy Haldane last year. Are negative rates helping growth? Analysts at Morgan Stanley think not, warning they are a \u201cdangerous experiment\u201d, particularly for the banking sector. \u201cWe are concerned it erodes bank profitability, creating other systemic risks,\u201d they said. They acknowledge that when there was first a discussion of negative interest rates, it helped bolster sentiment \u201cbecause it ended the debate on whether central banks are running out ammunition\u201d. That has changed. Michael Pearce, a global economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cPolicy loosening has fuelled, rather than soothed, market fears.\u201d What do negative rates mean for banks? If the share-price gyrations of Japanese banks are a gauge, there will be considerable turbulence. Analysts at UBS note that following the announcement of negative rates by the Bank of Japan on 29 January, Japanese bank share prices fell by around 30%. Bank shares globally have already been pummelled this year \u2013 eurozone banks are down 28% \u2013 and analysts at Morgan Stanley calculate that bank profits will be knocked by between 5% and 10%. How does it affect bank customers? Savings rates will remain low and banks will look to make profits in other ways. They could push fees for loans, such as mortgages, or impose charges on current accounts, which might otherwise be seen as \u201cfree\u201d. How might customers react? There is a concern that customers might make withdrawals of cash, although, according to the Swedish central bank, there have been no signs of any substantial rise in the use of cash in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland. This is because the banks did not pass on the negative rates to their customers - but that could change if negative rates were imposed for lengthier periods. Customers might also seek out higher returns elsewhere by looking at riskier investments. What would happen if negative rates became common? According to the Swedish central bank: \u201cThe most obvious problem associated with negative interest rates is that cash will sooner or later become a viable alternative to keeping money in the bank.\u201d Phasing out cash and replacing it with electronic money or putting a tax on money \u2013 known as the \u201cGesell tax\u201d after the economist Silvio Gesell \u2013 could also be an option. But whether policymakers would want to implement this and how it would work in practice is not clear.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>What are negative interest rates?</strong></h2> <p>Normally savers earn interest when they deposit their money in banks. Similarly, commercial banks that lodge money with central banks receive interest for doing so. Negative interest rates turn this arrangement on its head. Savers have to pay banks for holding their money and central banks penalise banks for depositing cash with them.</p> <h2><strong>Why </strong><strong>are we talking about them? </strong></h2> <p>Because central banks are increasingly using them to boost growth and raise the level of inflation. At present, it is really only commercial banks that are being charged negative interest rates but there is a possibility, if things get worse, that they will affect members of the public as well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/oecd-calls-for-less-austerity-and-more-public-investment\">OECD calls for less austerity and more public investment</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>What\u2019s the rationale for </strong><strong>negative rates?</strong><br></h2> <p>The idea is that negative interest rates provide banks with an incentive to lend money rather than to hoard it. The same would apply to members of the public, who would be encouraged to spend rather than save.</p> <h2><strong>Isn\u2019t this unusual?</strong></h2> <p>It is, but it reflects the low level of inflation across the global economy despite seven years of economic recovery. In the past, interest rates would have been strongly positive by this point. Japan has had the longest experience with low inflation and deflation, and on Tuesday <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/16/bank-of-japan-launches-negative-interest-rates-yen-markets\">the Bank of Japan introduced negative interest rates</a>. It is charging banks 0.1% for their excess deposits. </p> <h2><strong>Is Japan the first country to go negative?</strong></h2> <p>In recent history, the Swedes were first. Between July 2009 and September 2010 Sweden cut the deposit rate to -0.25% in an attempt to fend off the deep recession that followed the 2008 banking crash and global financial crisis. It reintroduced them in July 2014 and the deposit rate is currently -1.25%. </p> <p>Sweden\u2019s central bank became the first country to lend at a negative rate when in February 2015 it announced a negative repo rate \u2013 its main lending rate to commercial banks. Economists point out that this is largely a technicality because of the way its banking system operates.</p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39979ff5677eb348ff39d661680d098949a4bcce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39979ff5677eb348ff39d661680d098949a4bcce/0_0_902_653/500.jpg\" alt=\"central banks and negative rates graph\" width=\"500\" height=\"362\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><br><strong tabindex=\"-1\">Switzerland</strong> introduced a negative rate in December 2014.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s poor productivity record has been highlighted by government figures showing the biggest gap with other leading western economies since modern records began in the early 1990s. Output per hour worked in the UK was 18 percentage points below the average for the remaining six members of the G7 group of industrial nations in 2014, the Office for National Statistics said. The gap \u2013 up one percentage point on the previous year \u2013 was the widest since 1991 and showed a particularly marked deterioration since the onset of the financial crisis and deep recession of 2007-09. The shortfall was slightly smaller than the 20-point gap reported in the ONS\u2019s preliminary estimates released in September 2015. In the first half of the 2000s, the UK narrowed its productivity gap with the rest of the G7 to just 4 percentage points but the period since has seen that trend go into reverse. The ONS\u2019s final international estimates of productivity in 2014 found that output per hour in the UK was now 36 percentage points behind that in Germany - the biggest gap ever recorded with a fellow G7 country and up two points on 2013. Britain had a 30-point productivity shortfall with the US in 2014 - up three points on the previous year - and an unchanged 31-point gap with France. Only Japan of the G7 countries had a worse productivity record, the ONS said. The comparisons found that UK productivity was lower than that in the US in every sector of the economy, but was most evident in manufacturing. In the service sector, there had been a sharp deterioration in both financial and non-financial services since 2009. Productivity among all the G7 countries deteriorated since the so-called great recession, but the ONS said Britain had been hit hardest. Productivity was now 14 points below where it would have been had the pre-crisis trend continued \u2013 approximately twice the average for the rest of the G7. Data for 2015 has shown that a pick-up in productivity stopped in the final three months of the year, when the number of hours worked rose more quickly than the output of the economy. The new data also compares UK output per hour with some of the smaller European economies \u2013 Ireland, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands \u2013 with the record equally unimpressive. Britain has a five-point productivity gap with Spain, a 30-point gap with Ireland, a 34-point gap with Belgium and a 45-point gap with the Netherlands. The ONS said on its alternative measure of productivity \u2013 output per worker \u2013 the UK had a 19-point gap with the rest of the G7. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cFor all the good news on rising employment, the UK is still not creating enough quality jobs. The yawning productivity gap between us and other countries shows how much room there is for us to do better.

The move comes as Morrisons\u2019 rival Asda considers scrapping free tea and toast for its employees, and staff canteens, in an attempt to cut costs. The closure of the canteens and withdrawal of in-store services such as pizza making is part of plans to cut up to 1,000 jobs in stores. The supermarket is consulting with about 5,000 in-store staff about changes to their roles, or potential redundancy, and is also cutting about 200 head office jobs. Potts has previously said staff have a key role to play in the revival of Morrisons, which is battling to turn around a fall in sales amid heavy competition from the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl as well as bigger rivals such as Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s. Potts said: \u201cWe asked our staff for their views about their stores and many commented about their restrooms saying they would like them to be more relaxing and offer a better food service. This investment will ensure they are provided with the facilities and food to help them recharge during their breaks.\u201d Next month, Morrisons is to increase pay for 90,000 shop floor staff to \u00a38.20 an hour. That is above the \u00a37.20 \u201cnational living wage\u201d announced by George Osborne in the July budget last year and just below the \u00a38.25 living wage calculated by independent campaigners. Retailers have brought in a wave of wage rises ahead of the national living wage, and also increased publicity about the cost to the taxpayer in working tax credits to support those on low wages. Aldi and Lidl have also publicised the higher than average hourly wages they pay.",

      "bodyText": "The Koch brothers, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and BP\u2019s former boss Tony Hayward have had their mugshots drawn by a group of inmates as part of an art project entitled \u201cCaptured: people in prison drawing people who should be\u201d. None of the executives have been convicted of a crime, but the two New York City-based activists behind Captured have listed the \u201coffenses\u201d they claim the companies the executives oversaw perpetrated alongside the actual crime of the convict who drew them. Goldman Sachs, for example, is accused of \u201cmass deception\u201d and \u201cstealing taxpayers money\u201d. Last month the firm paid $5bn to settle charges it mis-sold mortgage-backed bonds in the run-up the financial crisis, the latest in a series of fines related to its role in a crisis that triggered the worst recession in living memory. His portrait is drawn by Ryan Gragg, who is serving 15 years for murder. Hayward was BP\u2019s boss during the Deepwater Horizon disaster of 2010, the worst oil spill in US history and a disaster that claimed the lives of 11 workers. BP is accused of \u201cmanslaughter\u201d and \u201cenvironmental crimes\u201d among other charges by the project. Hayward was drawn by Benjamin Gonzalez, who is serving nine years for robbery. \u201cIf you took a whole bucket of crimes our convicted artists committed, they would line up with the types of crimes our companies have committed,\u201d said Jeff Greenspan, who created the project with Andrew Tider. The pair were behind the installation of a bust of Edward Snowden at a Brooklyn park, but this project throws their complaints with corporate America into stark relief: inmate Kim Vanpelt, who is on death row for capital murder, drew the CEO of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan. BofA\u2019s rap sheet lists: \u201cconspiracy, fraud, securities fraud, theft.\u201d And the billionaire Koch Brothers are featured for facilitating \u201cmass deception,\u201d \u201cpublic endangerment\u201d and \u201crigging the system\u201d. Greenspan and Tider created the project to bring attention to corporate misdeeds. \u201cFrom what we\u2019ve researched, the actions of CitiBank have done a lot more damage to you and I and everyone we know in the community than just a stolen car,\u201d said Greenspan. The portraits and rap sheets can be seen on the project website and in a $40 book, the entire profits of which will be directed to the Bernie Sanders campaign. To find the artists, the activists approached art rehabilitation programs in prisons, but those groups were not interested in being involved with something political. So the pair turned to eBay, where there is a section devoted to art made by prisoners and sold by family members. They found similar prison art networks on Facebook and began conversations with the families of people whose worked they liked. From there, word spread around prisoners and other artists began sending them work. Each artist was paid $100 for their work, which often had to be paid through a system called JPay, which charges processing fees to prisoners accepting money. Tider said this meant they would have to pay $130 to some artists to cover the fees. Their frustrations with this, and how it takes advantage of people who largely come from underserved communities, inspired the pair to commission a portrait of JPay\u2019s CEO, Ryan Shapiro. \u201cWe learned so much about, on whatever level we can understand, what it\u2019s like to be an incarcerated person in this country,\u201d said Tider. The activists explained the thinking behind the project immediately to the prisoners who were then assigned portrait subjects. Most of the prisoners stuck with the people they were assigned but could draw someone else if they wanted to. Prisoners were told that money raised from the project would go to a charity or cause, but not specifically the Sanders campaign. The pair considered donating to corporate watchdog groups but settled on the Sanders\u2019 campaign. \u201cWe felt the Bernie Sanders campaign has the most potential we feel to actually bring about real reform in how corporations behave and how they\u2019re connected to our government,\u201d said Greenspan. All profits from the book sales go to support efforts to elect the Vermont senator. People involved with the project pledged to put their personal maximum contribution directly to the campaign, and excess money raised will support Sanders-related projects like rallies and other campaign projects. Meanwhile, Tider and Greenspan are still in contact with the prisoners and their families. Greenspan said almost all the inmates admitted their guilt in the course of the project and did not think they should be freed: \u201cThey weren\u2019t saying \u2018hey if the [CEOs] are out of jail, I should be out of jail\u2019, they were saying justice should be distributed evenly.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The OECD has called for its rich-country members to ease up on austerity and collectively agree to spend more on infrastructure projects to boost flagging growth. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development expressed concern about the state of the global economy as it cut growth forecasts made three months ago and warned that low interest rates and money creation by central banks were no longer enough for a lasting recovery. Marking the latest stage in its shift away from support for austerity, the OECD criticised the over-reliance on monetary policy \u2013 low interest rates and the money-creation process known as quantitative easing \u2013 and urged that countries adopt a more balanced approach. The OECD\u2019s chief economist Catherine Mann said: \u201cGiven the significant downside risks posed by financial sector volatility and emerging market debt, a stronger collective policy approach is urgently needed, focusing on a greater use of fiscal and pro-growth structural policies, to strengthen growth and reduce financial risks.\u201d She added: \u201cWith governments in many countries currently able to borrow for long periods at very low interest rates, there is room for fiscal expansion to strengthen demand in a manner consistent with fiscal sustainability.\u201d The OECD has in the past supported the deficit-reduction programme undertaken by the UK chancellor, George Osborne, but believes Britain should join other countries in spending more on public investment. Expressing concern about the weakness of demand, the OECD said in its interim economic outlook, that growth prospects have worsened in the past three months for every member of the G7 group of leading industrial nations \u2013 the US, the UK, Germany, Japan, Italy, France and Canada. \u201cMonetary policy cannot work alone. Fiscal policy is now contractionary in many major economies. Structural reform momentum has slowed.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThe OECD are correct to advise, as Labour has been arguing for months, that we need to increase investment. The time is right to invest now in our future in much-needed infrastructure, so that we avoid paying more at a later date for missing this opportunity. \u201cBut the truth is that since entering No 11, George Osborne doesn\u2019t put his money where his mouth is on infrastructure spending. He cut the level of investment in the UK with investment in infrastructure set to fall as a share of GDP, and he has allowed the Infrastructure Pipeline to become blocked with only 9% of projects listed as started.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cThe OECD\u2019s advice to the UK has not changed: we have the right economic strategy and have made significant progress over the past five years.\u201d The OECD reduced its 2016 global growth forecast by 0.3 points to 3%, leaving it unchanged on 2015 \u2013 the weakest year for global activity in half a decade. It also shaved 0.3 points off its 2017 forecast, reducing it to 3.3%. It added that the performance of the global economy was worse than its long-term average and weaker than would be expected during a recovery in the developed world and amid potential for a period of catch-up in emerging economies. \u201cThe downgrade in forecasts is widespread, reflecting a broad range of disappointing incoming data for the fourth quarter of 2015 and the recent weakness and volatility in global financial markets.\u201d Fiscal policy involves measures that affect tax and public spending, and the OECD said a more expansionary approach was needed to create a more favourable climate for structural reforms that would lead to higher productivity. It advocated that all countries should borrow at ultra-low interest rates for infrastructure projects, and that this would lead to stronger growth and lower debt levels. The call reflects the OECD\u2019s concern that investment has failed to pick up during the recovery. \u201cMany countries have room for fiscal expansion to strengthen demand. This should focus on policies with strong short-run benefits and that also contribute to long-term growth. \u201cA commitment to raising public investment collectively would boost demand while remaining on a fiscally sustainable path.\u201d It added that investment spending had a high multiplier effect, with strong knock-on effects from investment projects on overall growth rates. Quality infrastructure would support future growth and make up for \u201cthe shortfall in investment following the cuts imposed across advanced countries in recent years.\u201d The outlook report added: \u201cThe benefits of structural reforms would be enhanced by a more supportive demand environment, which increases the benefits to firms and workers of the new opportunities created and helps to support the necessary reallocation of resources.\u201d The OECD said it now expected the UK to grow by 2.1% in 2016 and 2% in 2017 \u2013 in both years a reduction of 0.3 points on its November 2015 forecasts. Its estimates for the US have been shaved by 0.5 points to 2% in 2016 and by 0.2 points to 2.2% in 2017. It added that the slow recovery in the eurozone was an important factor dragging on the global recovery and left Europe vulnerable to global shocks. The OECD cut 0.4 points off eurozone growth in 2016 and 0.2 points off eurozone growth in 2017, reducing its GDP estimates to 1.4% and 1.7% respectively. China\u2019s growth has been left unchanged at 6.5% in 2016 and 6.2% in 2017.",

      "bodyText": "The number of properties in Britain worth \u00a31m or more is set to more than triple by 2030, widening the gap between the housing haves and have-nots, according to a report. Less than half a million homes in the UK are currently valued at \u00a31m-plus, but a study by high street lender Santander claims this number will rise to more than 1.6m in the next 15 years. The report (PDF) also warns that affordability will worsen considerably by the end of the next decade as house price rises far outstrip growth in household incomes. The average property price amounts to 7.9 times the average income at present, but by 2030 this is expected to hit a multiple of 9.7. Santander said: \u201cBy 2030 the UK will be even more starkly divided into the housing wealthy and the housing poor than it is now.\u201d There is a stark geographical divide among the projected members of the \u00a31m club, according to Santander. One in four homes in London will cost \u00a31m-plus by 2030, rising to 70% in two boroughs in the capital \u2013 Kensington and Chelsea and the City of Westminster. More than half of homes in three more London boroughs \u2013 Camden, the City of London and Hammersmith and Fulham \u2013 will also be worth more than \u00a31m. Across the south-east, 7% of homes are expected to be valued at that level. However, many areas of the UK \u2013 the north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Humber, Scotland and the East Midlands \u2013 are expected to host a negligible number of such expensive houses (less than 1%). One area, Torfaen in Wales, home to more than 90,000 people, will have none. The report, carried out in partnership with Paul Cheshire, professor of economic geography at the London School of Economics, predicts that prices in London, which are currently 11.5 times average incomes, will soar to a multiple of 16.5 by 2030. Cheshire said: \u201cBy 2030, the divide between housing haves at the top and the have-nots at the bottom will be even wider than it is now. More owners will enjoy millionaire status, as homes that many would consider modest fetch seven figure prices in sought-after areas. \u201cIt will make entering the market more difficult still for new buyers, further highlighting the importance of the right timing, advice, support and financial planning; and not just having a mum and dad who bought a house, but a grandparent, too.\u201d The average property price in the UK, currently \u00a3283,565, is expected to double by 2030, breaking through the \u00a3500,000 mark to \u00a3557,444. For the poorest 25% of households, affordability is expected to get worse in all regions. The price of a house at the bottom of the price chart will be 17 times the income of a person earning the lowest quartile wage in London by 2030. Those hoping to buy will need to head to Northern Ireland, which is set to remain the most affordable region. Despite government initiatives such as the help to buy scheme, steep housing costs have locked many out of the property market, especially in London, where almost one in 10 teachers are still living with their parents after five years in the profession. Young people are among the worst hit. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has warned that the under-35s are becoming permanent renters, with home ownership reserved for the well-off and elderly. The Santander report notes that the cost of borrowing is still at record lows and argues that despite tough conditions, \u201cwith the right support\u201d those who want to get on the property ladder can do so.",

      "bodyText": "The simmering row over high energy prices has been reignited after British Gas\u2019s residential supply business reported a 31% leap in annual profits to \u00a3574m. The soaring profit comes amid growing calls for the big six suppliers to cut energy bills for customers in line with falling wholesale prices. Fuel Poverty Action, a campaign group for those struggling to pay their energy bills, said the figures released on Thursday showed the company was profiteering at the expense of hard-pressed consumers. \u201cIt is absolutely sickening that British Gas has made bumper profits in a year when there were more winter deaths than at any time this century. We have seen British Gas mercilessly hound hard-up customers even when bills are in dispute,\u201d said Fuel Poverty Action\u2019s Ruth London. British Gas, which holds about 40% of UK gas accounts, has announced three price cuts in the last 12 months, which it claims could lower a dual fuel bill by almost \u00a3100 a year. However, critics have always argued that the cuts have been small compared with the savings made from tumbling wholesale costs, partly caused by the collapse in the global price of oil and gas. Iain Conn, chief executive of British Gas\u2019 parent group Centrica, denied the company was profiteering arguing it made a margin of \u00a355 per residential customer each year, up from \u00a342 in 2014 but in line with past averages. Improved British Gas profits last year were the result of a slightly colder winter and lower costs, said Conn, who insisted \u201cwe passed on the impact of falling commodity prices to customers\u201d. Fuel Poverty Action blamed the government for failing to crack down on energy suppliers. \u201cDespite all the headlines, the power of the big six remains absolute, thanks to a government that is happy to leave its citizens to die in cold homes. Cuts to insulation programmes and renewable energy have made customers colder while lining the pockets of big six shareholders,\u201d said London. Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com said the British Gas results should send warning signals to financial regulators finalising a report following a two-year review of the energy markets. \u201cSeeing a major supplier report increased profits at a time of sustained low wholesale prices should strengthen the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s determination to fix the broken energy market. We are urging the CMA to put forward bold recommendations to get more consumers shopping around for energy to increase competition, lower prices and improve customer service.\u201d The strong performance at British Gas came as parent company Centrica made almost \u00a32bn of writedowns due to the plunging price of oil and gas. The figures show total British Gas operating profits at \u00a3809m, down 2% while Centrica group\u2019s adjusted operating profits fell 12% to \u00a31.5bn, roughly in line with analyst forecasts. Centrica said last summer it would be exiting some of the production businesses and has announced plans to cut 6,000 posts across the group or 10% of its workforce. It has simultaneously promised to create 2,000 new jobs. Conn said he was confident that the latest financial results would have no impact on the final CMA report and recommendations which are scheduled to be published next month. The Centrica chief executive said the group was performing well in difficult circumstances and there would be no cut in the dividend to shareholders. \u201cCentrica has delivered a resilient financial performance, with solid 2015 adjusted earnings despite the challenge of falling wholesale oil and gas prices,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A concrete wall six metres high and 600 metres long is needed to prevent refugees and migrants from entering the Channel tunnel at Calais, according to Eurotunnel. The company is asking the British and French governments to foot the \u20ac6m (\u00a34.6m) bill for the work, as well as reimbursing \u20ac29m (\u00a323m) in lost revenue and costs from last year. Eurotunnel said it expected even more migrants to attempt to reach the UK this summer, and has called for a joint control centre linking police, border guards and security staff to be implemented swiftly in preparation. The operator of the tunnel linking the UK with France said disruption at Calais affected its truck and passenger shuttle services in the second half of 2015. Announcing its annual results, it said: \u201cThe security of the fixed link being the responsibility of the two governments, a claim for \u20ac29m has been made via the intergovernmental commission to compensate essentially the revenue losses due to migrant pressure.\u201d The chief executive, Jacques Gounon, said the Treaty of Canterbury made the states\u2019 obligations clear, but said Eurotunnel was still shouldering additional costs for what was a question of public security. He said that while measures taken by Britain and France had meant there had been no disruption or breaches since late October last year, \u201cI regret that when I asked for reaction in the first half [of 2015] I could not persuade the state that action was needed.\u201d He said he expected the governments to \u201cfind a suitable gentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d over the compensation bill, adding: \u201cWhat is important that it is a long-term relationship and what happened before the state reaction is absolutely clear. Traffic in January and February has shown that it is not an issue now.\u201d But, he added, both governments needed to do more and spend more to maintain the tunnel\u2019s security: \u201cThere is a risk of course: we know that millions of migrants could overwhelm Europe this summer and some could go to Calais. We want the funding to be one step in advance of any new migrant invasion. \u201cI would not like to be in the same position [this year] \u2026 It would be better to anticipate a new invasion of migrants this summer. This is a long term issue and we need to be prepared.\u201d The concrete wall would extend the mouth of the tunnel 600m further into France along the Eurostar tracks, which have been identified as a potential weak spot to breach the tunnel security. Eurotunnel carries Eurostar high-speed trains between Paris, Brussels and London, and shuttle trains containing passenger cars, coaches and freight trucks. The company suffered disruption to its services starting in the summer from refugees and migrants, 6,000 of whom now live in the makeshift camps outside Calais known as the Jungle. The \u20ac29m claim mainly covers reduced revenue but also includes the cost of paying employees for extra shifts. People trying to stow away on trains bound for the UK forced rail operators to suspend night-time services on and off from June to October, causing the number of trains running through the tunnel last year to fall 17% to 2,421. The number of people trying to board trains illegally fell dramatically after Britain funded fences in Calais and France deployed extra police, Eurotunnel said. \u201cThe work done in co-operation with the British and French governments ... has enabled Eurotunnel to provide a transport service with no disruption since October 2015,\u201d the company said. Eurotunnel\u2019s services were also affected by the terrorist attacks on Paris in November, which hit cross-channel coach travel as well. For the year to the end of December, operating profit rose 2% to \u20ac387m from revenues of \u20ac1.2bn, up 5%. Eurotunnel transported 2.6m passenger vehicles and 1.5m trucks. The company increased its 2015 dividend by 22% to 22 cents and forecast a further rise in profit this year and next, driven by higher economic activity on both sides of the channel.",

      "bodyText": "The Australian Infrastructure Plan released on Wednesday contains a broad outlook over the next 15 years, which offers attractive views on how Australia might look in 2031. But it also contains much that will be as politically difficult to implement as was the failed attempt to increase the GST. How quickly things change. Last year in May when Tony Abbott released Infrastructure Australia\u2019s (IA) audit report he began his speech by boasting: \u201cYou have got a prime minister for infrastructure here today, you have got a deputy prime minister for infrastructure, and you have got minister Briggs as well.\u201d Now we have a prime minister who doesn\u2019t badge himself with the dopey tag of \u201cinfrastructure prime minister\u201d, the deputy PM is now the minister for agriculture, and minister Briggs is just a cautionary tale. But what doesn\u2019t change is politicians\u2019 love of infrastructure. \u201cThere is nothing better than to see big yellow things pushing dirt around. It is marvellous,\u201d said Barnaby Joyce on Wednesday. Since the Liberal party has come into power there has however been a fall in the sightings of those big yellow things: But there are signs that a change has occurred with the past two quarters showing an increase in the amount of engineering work yet to be done on roads, bridges, rail and harbours: So there is work in the pipeline, even if the level of investment remains only around 2007 levels. But more is not always better, which is where Infrastructure Australia comes in \u2013 its plan outlines the framework for infrastructure development and funding and also a priority list of projects. The overriding factor of the IA plan is Australia\u2019s population. Coming as it did in the same week Australia\u2019s population passed 24 million, the report notes by 2031 Australia\u2019s population should have reached 30 million. Overwhelmingly, the growth will occur in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. The report notes that in the next 15 years, these cities will \u201ccollectively need to accommodate 5.9 million more people\u201d. This leads to two main issues: where to put those people in a manner which continues our way of life (within certain parameters); and how to ensure our economy copes with that growth to ensure the 30 million people continue to enjoy growing living standards. On the first issue, IA recommends more \u201cmedium to high-density development within established urban areas\u201d but it also notes this alone is not enough. Sounding a bit like a time-share brochure, it argues that this higher density housing must also offer \u201chigh-quality design\u201d be \u201cwell-connected by infrastructure to jobs and education\u201d, and also provide \u201caccess to high-quality public spaces, including parks, community facilities and cultural precincts\u201d. How to achieve this? Well the report comes in two parts \u2013 the infrastructure plan, and its latest \u201cpriority list\u201d. In some ways the priority list is the more sexy of the two (well, as sexy as these things can get) as it contains the list of actual projects to be undertaken. The overall plan is more philosophical in nature and outlines how things must change in order to achieve this wonderful future that has \u201chigh-frequency, interconnected public transport systems\u201d that move people about \u201cefficiently and comfortably\u201d. The priority list gets the headlines because the aspects are more concrete (literally). For example, the list includes the now shelved Melbourne East West Link. This project, which was halted by the election of the Andrews Labor government in Victoria, is rated by IA as one of the \u201chigh priority initiatives\u201d. But we should be a bit careful of overselling what that means. There are 30 such projects listed and eight of those are in Victoria. IA does note of the East West Link that the annual cost of delays due to the congestion along Melbourne\u2019s east-west corridor is $73m, and by 2031 the cost will increase to $144m. The cost is no surprise as it was identified last year in IA\u2019s audit report. But it does not actually mean IA is recommending the project proposed by the former Victorian Liberal government and supported by Tony Abbott. Importantly, IA rates the next stage of the project as \u201cinitiative development\u201d \u2013 ie start thinking about what you want to do and then come up with a business case. Given the previous East West Link project was rated at having a return of just 45 cents for every dollar invested, that suggests there is a ways to go before that project will commence. The overall IA plan, while more abstract in nature, also sets out some fairly headline-grabbing points, mostly around funding. When releasing the plan, Malcolm Turnbull suggested that \u201cthere is plenty of money around, both in the private markets and in the general infrastructure investment world\u201d, which is Turnbull-speak for avoiding saying \u201cpublic funds\u201d. While the report does recommend governments take advantage of the very low levels of interest to pay for infrastructure with borrowings, it has an overall sharp focus on private sector funding \u2013 especially user-pays. It recommends a user-pays system for roads \u2013 arguing the current \u201csystem is unfair because the link between usage and charging is weak\u201d. The report notes that our roads are paid through a mix of taxes such as the fuel excise (46%), registration fees (20%), licence fees (2%), stamp duty (10%) and a top-up from other taxes for the remaining 22%. The report argues that the fuel excise is inefficient \u2013 especially as car makers are moving to make cars more fuel efficient \u2013 and the registration fee has no link with the level of use of roads. It recommends dispensing with such charges over 10 years and moving to purely user pays. There are, of course, already user-pay roads \u2013 tolls for motorways and tunnels and bridges \u2013 but this would be of a level thus far unseen in Australia. And given IA is effectively recommending in-car monitoring of travel, motorists would have to be happy with the government knowing where you are every time you go for a drive. Given such tolls would also be the purview of state governments to levy, any moves by the federal government to reduce fuel excise in order to push towards this model would see a massive bunfight of a GST level. It would also require public transport to be a lot better, but under the IA plan, that too would become more expensive. IA argues that only around 20% of the costs of public transport come from users \u2013 the rest is from general taxation. It argues greater cost recovery should come from users, and costs should be lowered via increased competition, arguing, \u201call public transport operators in Australia should be routinely and periodically exposed to a competitive process\u201d. Greater competition via privatisation is also something it recommends for the NBN. It argues that in the \u201cmedium term\u201d the NBN should be split up, either along technology or geographic lines, and sold. It also argues that the NBN will \u201cmaterially improve service levels and the ability of households in rural and remote regions to connect to their wider social networks\u201d, so it might be wise to wait till that actually occurs before finding a bidder. The 200-page report and its 73 recommendations offer some nice opportunities for governments and also a few traps \u2013 little wonder Turnbull was using the traditional kick-the-can-down-the-road response of saying \u201cwe will look at it carefully\u201d and repeatedly promising the importance of a \u201ca fair go\u201d. Because while everyone likes to see \u201cbig yellow things\u201d, there is much less agreement on how they should be paid for, and who should own the infrastructure they produce.",

The report notes that our roads are paid through a mix of taxes such as the fuel excise (46%), registration fees (20%), licence fees (2%), stamp duty (10%) and a top-up from other taxes for the remaining 22%. </p> <p>The report argues that the fuel excise is inefficient \u2013 especially as car makers are moving to make cars more fuel efficient \u2013 and the registration fee has no link with the level of use of roads. </p> <p>It recommends dispensing with such charges over 10 years and moving to purely user pays. </p> <p>There are, of course, already user-pay roads \u2013 tolls for motorways and tunnels and bridges \u2013 but this would be of a level thus far unseen in Australia. And given IA is effectively recommending in-car monitoring of travel, motorists would have to be happy with the government knowing where you are every time you go for a drive. </p> <p>Given such tolls would also be the purview of state governments to levy, any moves by the federal government to reduce fuel excise in order to push towards this model would see a massive bunfight of a GST level. </p> <p>It would also require public transport to be a lot better, but under the IA plan, that too would become more expensive. IA argues that only around 20% of the costs of public transport come from users \u2013 the rest is from general taxation. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/17/negative-gearing-parents-may-have-to-choose-between-themselves-and-their-children\">Negative gearing: parents may have to choose between themselves and their children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It argues greater cost recovery should come from users, and costs should be lowered via increased competition, arguing, \u201call public transport operators in Australia should be routinely and periodically exposed to a competitive process\u201d.<br></p> <p>Greater competition via privatisation is also something it recommends for the NBN. It argues that in the \u201cmedium term\u201d the NBN should be split up, either along technology or geographic lines, and sold. </p> <p>It also argues that the NBN will \u201cmaterially improve service levels and the ability of households in rural and remote regions to connect to their wider social networks\u201d, so it might be wise to wait till that actually occurs before finding a bidder. </p> <p>The 200-page report and its 73 recommendations offer some nice opportunities for governments and also a few traps \u2013 little wonder Turnbull was using the traditional kick-the-can-down-the-road response of saying \u201cwe will look at it carefully\u201d and repeatedly promising the importance of a \u201ca fair go\u201d.</p> <p>Because while everyone likes to see \u201cbig yellow things\u201d, there is much less agreement on how they should be paid for, and who should own the infrastructure they produce.</p>",
