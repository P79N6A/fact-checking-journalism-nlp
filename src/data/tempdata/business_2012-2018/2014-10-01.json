It was an increase on the \u00a3651,000 profit share a year earlier, and the combined profit pot to be shared among the firm\u2019s 567 partners increased by 12% to \u00a3412m. Partners at fellow \u201cbig four\u201d UK accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers received an average profit-share payout of \u00a3722,000, up 2%. All parts of EY\u2019s business grew in the year to 27 June 2014, with revenues up 8.6% to \u00a31.87bn, partly thanks to a rising number of private equity deals and company floats.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s top financial regulator has launched a full-scale investigation into the \u00a3250m accounting scandal that has plunged Tesco into crisis. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) informed Tesco on Tuesday about the investigation, which will start by examining whether the company broke rules on accurate financial disclosure but it could widen to take in possible criminal misconduct. The regulator has the power to prosecute people who make deliberately or recklessly misleading statements to the stock exchange. Tesco said last week that it was in contact with the FCA. Tesco commissioned Deloitte, the accountants, and the law firm Freshfields to carry out an independent inquiry. In a statement to the stock exchange, the UK\u2019s biggest retailer said: \u201cThe Financial Conduct Authority has notified Tesco that it has commenced a full investigation following the overstatement of expected profit for the half year which was described in our announcement of 22 September 2014 and which is currently the subject of an independent review by Deloitte. Tesco will continue to cooperate fully with the FCA and other relevant authorities considering this matter.\u201d Last week, Tesco stunned investors by announcing that a whistleblower had alerted its most senior lawyer to over-optimistic accounting for payments from suppliers and business costs. The group admitted it had overstated its expected first-half profits by \u00a3250m. The statement came three weeks after a trading update that predicted first-half profit would be \u00a31.1bn, down from \u00a31.6bn a year earlier. Tesco\u2019s shares have fallen every day since last Monday\u2019s announcement and have lost more than a fifth of their value in that time. They were down 3% at 179p in afternoon trading. Sainsbury\u2019s put further pressure on Tesco over the error by saying it was confident its own commercial revenues were properly recorded. Sainsbury\u2019s finance director John Rogers said: It was a \u201cgross misrepresentation that this is a grey area of subjectivity. The accounting rules are clearly defined.\u201d The Financial Reporting Council, the accountancy watchdog, and the Serious Fraud Office are also monitoring events at the group. Tesco\u2019s new chief executive, Dave Lewis, suspended four senior managers, including the head of Tesco\u2019s UK food business, when the accounting irregularity was discovered. After joining from Unilever at the start of last month he is battling to steady the giant retailer, which some analysts say is now too destabilised to invest in. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said: \u201cSuch an investigation (by the FCA) can only be another distraction for new CEO Dave Lewis and represents another black mark on the board.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The big six energy suppliers are facing the loss of a quarter of their customers over the next six years, knocking \u00a3500m a year off their collective profits, City financial analysts have said. Some large companies could be driven out of the market, the research arm of Citigroup investment bank said in a report released on Wednesday. But consumers will still suffer as the average dual-fuel bill will be at least 20% higher by 2020, the analysts predict. The rise of small suppliers highlighted in the Citi report, UK Energy Policy \u2013 Unwinding the Big 6, will please the coalition government but the authors said Ed Miliband\u2019s promised price freeze has played a key role too. The report concluded: \u201cDue to increasing competition we see the market share of the \u2018Big 6\u2019 in energy supply declining from 98% in 2013 to below 70% by 2020. When combined with declining demand and lower margins the total profit pool available to the large energy suppliers could fall [by about] 40% from [about] \u00a31.2bn in 2013 to just \u00a3700m.\u201d The grim assessment of the future for the big six by Citi will worry traditional shareholders but will inspire the new breed of independent energy providers such as First Utility and Ovo that have been gaining customers by offering cheaper tariffs. The large integrated businesses such as Centrica, SSE and E.ON have partly been the architects of their own problems, Citi said, noting that \u201chistorically customer service has not been a key focus\u201d. It said all the six large utilities \u2013 ScottishPower, EDF and npower are the remaining three \u2013 which are facing an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority, will need to restructure their supply businesses and improve customer service if they are to hang on to even the predicted lower number of customers. Citi said some of the market shakeup can be attributed to politics. \u201cThe UK energy supply market has become increasingly competitive in the last year due partly to the fallout from the Labour party\u2019s proposed price freeze announcement late last year and increasing publicity for the industry,\u201d said the report. It added: \u201cAs a result, the number of customers switching suppliers increased dramatically in the fourth quarter 2013/first quarter of 2014 but the rate of switching has fallen back towards historical levels in recent months.\u201d Citi noted that Centrica, which provides gas and electricity under the British Gas label, reported earnings before interest and taxes of more than \u00a3600m from residential supply in 2012. \u201cIf the supply market does develop as the current trends suggest and the available profit pool declines by circa 40% we may well see some participants simply running their supply business to maximise cashflow in the short term and exit the market at some point,\u201d it argued. Citi also believes the big six\u2019s share of power generation could be driven down from 70% to less than 50% by 2020 because of a reduction in the supply business, cuts in the availability of renewable energy subsidies from the government and the closure of traditional plants. The market share in the supply side of the big six has fallen from 98% to about 92% in the past year, partly driven by anger about last autumn\u2019s price rises. Figures from independent consultants Cornwall Energy indicate customers have 3.8m accounts with the smaller suppliers and 45.9m with the big six. Citi believes retail bills will rise by 20% by the end of the decade as a result of factors including inflation, increased infrastructure costs and the effect of government green policies. In a separate development, the government is expected to reveal changes to its \u201ccontracts for difference\u201d and \u201crenewables obligation\u201d subsidy schemes that the solar industry fears will damage the sector. The Renewable Energy Association said: \u201cWith stable policy, solar is on track to be subsidy-free by the end of this decade, but pulling the rug on the industry would derail those cost reductions.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Growth in the world\u2019s $70tn (\u00a343tn) shadow banking system is a risk to financial stability and monitoring of the sector is inadequate, the International Monetary Fund has warned. The Washington-based fund said in its twice-yearly global financial stability report that lending outside the regulated banks was increasing in the post-crisis world, partly because of greater banking regulation. \u201cThe global financial crisis revealed that, absent adequate regulation, shadow banking can put the stability of the financial system at risk in several ways. \u201cSince the crisis, the ongoing tightening of bank regulations may be encouraging a shift of traditional banking activities into the shadows.\u201d Britain\u2019s shadow banking sector is more than twice the size of any other economy\u2019s as a share of GDP, according to the IMF. But despite its large size in the UK, it is in the US that lending outside the regulated banks poses the biggest risk, the fund said. This was partly because the US was the only country where shadow banking assets were greater than those of the conventional banks. Gaston Gelos, division chief for global financial stability analysis at the IMF, said that while some elements of the shadow banking sector served a useful role, for example as a source of business lending and to improve market liquidity, too little was understood about the scale and nature of its activities. \u201cWe are worried about what we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t have the data,\u201d he said. The sector \u2013 which includes lending by institutions such as hedge funds, property funds and private equity, as well as through derivatives \u2013 grew rapidly in the runup to the financial crisis, and was partly blamed for the freezing of credit markets in 2007. The IMF said that at the end of 2013, shadow banking accounted for around 30% of systemic risk in the US, the same proportion as its banking sector. It was lower in the UK and eurozone \u2013 7% and 13% respectively \u2013 where the banking sector posed a greater systemic risk because of its size. \u201cThe US shadow banking system appears to contribute most to domestic systemic risk; its contribution is much less pronounced in the euro area and the United Kingdom.\u201d Evidence suggested that shadow banking activities were picking up in the UK, US and eurozone, partly driven by tighter regulation of regular banks, as well as by low interest rates. Securitisations have declined, but less risky shadow banking activities, such as those by investment funds, have expanded rapidly. \u201cOverall, shadow banking is set to grow further in the current environment of tighter bank regulations and low interest rates. Many indications point to the migration of some activities \u2013 such as lending to firms \u2013 from traditional banking to the non-bank sector.\u201d Part of the recent rise in the sector in the UK could be explained by growth in peer-to-peer online lending to households and small businesses, the IMF said. The IMF said shadow banking growth in emerging markets was also rising, notably in China, where it accounted for an estimated 35-55% of GDP and was expanding at twice the rate of bank credit. \u201cIn emerging market economies, the growth of shadow banking size and activities in China stands out and warrants particular monitoring,\u201d the fund said. Gelos said international cooperation would be required: \u201cMore effort to collect data on activities and entities is important. We propose a macroprudential approach to monitoring.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Europe has a problem and it is called Germany. The crisis that has bedevilled the single currency area for the past five years started with the smaller countries on the eurozone\u2019s periphery: Greece, Ireland, Portugal. Then it moved to the bigger countries of Southern Europe: Spain and Italy. Next the malaise spread to the second biggest economy: France. All the time, though, the sense was that Germany \u2013 the powerhouse of the eurozone \u2013 was immune. Exports from the factories of Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia were booming. Business confidence was high. Growth was solid. While the core of the eurozone remained secure, there was nothing really to fear. That was then. The story today is of waning confidence and drooping factory orders. The snapshot of German manufacturers shows that for the first time in more than a year industry is contracting rather than expanding. A temporary blip caused by the tension in Ukraine? In part, yes. Sentiment has clearly been affected by fears that Russia could decide to annex eastern Ukraine, while sanctions have affected exports. But that\u2019s not the whole story. German exports were falling even before the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, and that was mainly due to falling demand from the rest of the eurozone. At Berlin\u2019s insistence, domestic demand has been squeezed across Europe. Everybody has been urged to cut costs, become more competitive and adopt the German model of export-led growth. But if Spanish, Italian and Portuguese consumers lack spending power, they can\u2019t afford a spanking new BMW or a Miele washing machine. That means weaker German exports, lower German growth and in turn less demand for Spanish, Italian and Portuguese exports. All of which explains the current state of the eurozone: a faltering recovery that poses the risk of a triple-dip recession and deflation. Growth stagnated in the second quarter this year and is on course to be no better in the third. Inflation, according to the flash estimate published this week, stands at 0.3%. The experiment \u2013 German designed, German engineered and German exported \u2013 with austerity has failed. The eurozone is not cutting its way back to prosperity. It is cutting its way towards being the new Japan. If policymakers in Berlin were willing to accept this, they might be prepared to see the sense in easing up on the spending cuts and wage reductions. They might even see virtue in a modern Marshall Plan for Europe, under which Germany would run down its budget surplus in order to boost spending not only in its own economy but in the rest of the eurozone. But that is not going to happen. Instead, Germany will belatedly and begrudgingly drop its opposition to the European Central Bank using full-strength quantitative easing \u2013 buying government bonds to create money \u2013 to try to kickstart growth. Expect hints of QE to emerge from the ECB on Thursday.",

While the core of the eurozone remained secure, there was nothing really to fear.</p> <p>That was then. The story today is of waning confidence and drooping factory orders. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2014/oct/01/uk-watchdog-probes-tesco-sainsbury-sales-fall-business-live\">The snapshot of German manufacturers shows that for the first time in more than a year industry is contracting rather than expanding</a>. A temporary blip caused by the tension in Ukraine? In part, yes. Sentiment has clearly been affected by fears that Russia could decide to annex eastern Ukraine, while sanctions have affected exports.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not the whole story. German exports were falling even before the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, and that was mainly due to falling demand from the rest of the eurozone. At Berlin\u2019s insistence, domestic demand has been squeezed across Europe. Everybody has been urged to cut costs, become more competitive and adopt the German model of export-led growth.</p> <p>But if Spanish, Italian and Portuguese consumers lack spending power, they can\u2019t afford a spanking new BMW or a Miele washing machine. That means weaker German exports, lower German growth and in turn less demand for Spanish, Italian and Portuguese exports.</p> <p>All of which explains the current state of the eurozone: a faltering recovery that poses the risk of a triple-dip recession and deflation. Growth stagnated in the second quarter this year and is on course to be no better in the third. Inflation, according to the flash estimate published this week, stands at 0.3%.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/01/austerity-eurozone-disaster-joseph-stiglitz\">experiment \u2013 German designed, German engineered and German exported \u2013 with austerity has failed</a>. The eurozone is not cutting its way back to prosperity. It is cutting its way towards being the new Japan.</p> <p>If policymakers in Berlin were willing to accept this, they might be prepared to see the sense in easing up on the spending cuts and wage reductions. They might even see virtue in a modern Marshall Plan for Europe, under which Germany would run down its budget surplus in order to boost spending not only in its own economy but in the rest of the eurozone.</p> <p>But that is not going to happen. Instead, Germany will belatedly and begrudgingly drop its opposition to the European Central Bank using full-strength quantitative easing \u2013 buying government bonds to create money \u2013 to try to kickstart growth. Expect hints of QE to emerge from the ECB on Thursday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Japan avoided the biggest of all \u201cfat finger\u201d meltdowns on Wednesday when an unidentified large stockbroker managed to cancel rogue trades worth more than the size of Sweden\u2019s economy. Orders for shares in 42 companies worth 67.78 trillion yen (\u00a3380bn) were cancelled in Tokyo, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. If the orders had gone through the hapless dealer would have traded more than half the shares of Toyota, the world\u2019s biggest carmaker, for 12.7tn yen. Trades were also scrapped for other big Japanese names such as Sony, Honda and Nomura. Ayako Sera, a market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust in Tokyo, told Bloomberg: \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of orders this big being cancelled before. There must have been an error.\u201d Despite a regulatory clampdown since the financial crisis, the world\u2019s watchdogs have been unable to stamp out one of the biggest threats to orderly markets \u2013 human error. The firm whose trader almost committed the ultimate typo will not suffer losses because it managed to correct the order. But other distracted or exhausted traders have not been so lucky. HSBC\u2019s shares briefly leapt 10% last year when a dealer mistakenly ordered 2.5m shares in the bank, instead of $2.5m (\u00a31.5m) worth of shares, compounding the error by sending competing orders all trying to buy the shares. In 2005, Japan\u2019s Mizuho Financial lost 27bn yen when it was unable to cancel a mistyped share order in cable operator J-com in time. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said that though markets self-correct after aberrant trades, the Japanese orders would have caused blind panic as automated trades tracked the market downwards. \u201cWhen you get an order of that size it\u2019s human nature and with a large move the robots, the algorithms, will jump on the back of it.\u201d The unidentified broker who made the Toyota order was able to cancel the trades because they were carried out on the over-the-counter (OTC) market, which gives traders time to cancel before completion. OTC transactions are carried out directly between the buyer and the seller and not through an exchange. The biggest stock market fall ever, 2010\u2019s flash crash in New York, was initially blamed on a fat finger sell order for Procter &amp; Gamble shares. The investigation into the $1 trillion collapse concluded that a large but intended single trade in a fragile market had set off a spiral of selling.",

      "bodyText": "Over to Greece, and a meeting between prime minister Antonis Samaras and his deputy Evangelos Venizelos has begun in a bid to smooth over growing signs of friction in Athens\u2019 two-party coalition. Helena Smith writes: The two men, on the second day of talks in the capital with negotiators representing the country\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF, are reportedly at loggerheads over the way the talks are being handled. Samaras asked for the meeting after the Greek finance minister, Gikas Hardouvelis, a technocrat believed to be more in line with Venizelos\u2019 Pasok party, \u201cwent ballistic\u201d when the Greek leader insisted on one of his most trusted advisers sitting in on negotiations Hardouvelis was conducting with mission chiefs on Tuesday. Growing speculation of early elections - in both the media and government circles - has added to the need for the two leaders \u201cto come up with a concrete strategy that will define targets and goals,\u201d one insider said. Samaras has repeatedly said that his government will live out its four-year term but the need to find a replacement for the incumbent president - and the opposition\u2019s threats to block the government\u2019s candidate - may well force early elections in the coming months, throwing debt-stricken Greece, the euro zone\u2019s weakest link, into renewed political turmoil. And on that note, it\u2019s time to shut up for the evening. Thanks for all you comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for, among other things, the latest European Central Bank meeting. A series of disappointing manufacturing surveys from around the globe - from China to Germany, from the UK to US - has got October and the final quarter of the year off to a bad start, writes Nick Fletcher. Added to investors concerns about an economic slowdown were geopolitical worries - repercussions from the Hong Kong protests, the air strikes on Isis - and the news of a diagnosed Ebola case in the US. Back with the economy, and all eyes will be on the European Central Bank\u2019s latest meeting on Thursday and the US non-farm payroll numbers on Friday. Meanwhile, here are the closing scores in the markets: The FTSE 100 finished down 65.20 points or 0.98% at 6557.52, its lowest level since April Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.97% to 9382.03 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.15% at 4365.27 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 0.89% to 20,706.31 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.67% lower at 10,753.2 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 188 points or 1.1%. Time for another catch-up. World stock markets have fallen back this afternoon as investors fret over global growth prospects. America\u2019s factories grew at a slower rate than expected.... ..and Brazil\u2019s manufacturers suffered a contraction. France\u2019s government has announced that it will not get its deficit below 3% of GDP until 2017, declaring that it will not impose more austerity. German firms are not impressed. There is better news on jobs, though: Ireland\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen. And US private firms created 213,000 new jobs last month Over in Athens, talks are underway between the Troika and the Greek government. And Greece is preparing to welcome EC president-elect Jean Claude Juncker on Friday. Reminder, my late-morning summary outlines how UK and eurozone factory growth was weaker than expected in September. World stock markets are falling this afternoon as today\u2019s flurry of weaker-than-expected manufacturing output data spook investors. Europe\u2019s main markets are all in the red, with the FTSE 100 down 71 points or around 1%. France\u2019s CAC is leading the fallers, down 1.3%. Here\u2019s the latest damage: Traders are reacting to the news that factory growth in the UK and across the eurozone slowed last month, with manufacturing in the German powerhouse unexpectedly stalling. On Wall Street the Dow has shed 150 points in early trading. Traders say that today\u2019s private sector employment report (details here), showing that over 200,000 new jobs were created last month, is also hitting shares; on speculation that it makes an early US interest rate rise more likely. Talk of a Fed rate hike has driven the dollar steadily higher in recent weeks. Ashraf Laidi, chief global strategist at City Index, says this could spark a selloff: With evidence showing that a rising US dollar begins to hurt smaller cap stocks before it spills over onto bigger cap companies, this would be another excuse to wave the red flag warning for larger cap stocks. America\u2019s manufacturing sector has also seen growth slow last month, confirming that the world\u2019s factories lost momentum in September. The ISM US manufacturing activity index fell to 56.6, from 59 in August, meaning it expanded at a slower rate. New orders and employment growth both slowed too. And in another blow to confidence, US construction spending has fallen by 0.8% in August, dashing expectations of a 0.5% rise. The International Monetary Fund has also suggested for top bankers\u2019 pay to be changed, so that senior executives are paid in debt as well as cash and shares. That would help to make them more concerned about long-term stability, it argues, and defer risky behaviour. More on the FT: IMF calls for shake-up of bank executive pay The IMF has raised concerns over shadow banking -- lending from non-bank financial companies, which has grown strongly in recent years. In its biannual review of global financial stability, it warns that Britain\u2019s shadow banking sector is more than twice the size of any other economy\u2019s as a share of GDP. But America\u2019s shadow banking is the biggest worry because , the IMF says, the US is the only country where shadow banking assets are greater than those of the conventional bank Full story: IMF warns on size of UK shadow banking sector Brazil\u2019s factory sector has slipped back into contraction. The Brazil manufacturing PMI, calculated by HSBC, fell to 49.3 in September, from 50.2 in August. 50 points is the cut-off mark between expansion and contraction. It highlights the weakness in the country\u2019s economy as Brazilians prepare to head to the polls to elect their president. It also shows that the manufacturing slowdown isn\u2019t just confined to Europe (see earlier summary for details). HSBC reports that \u201cBrazilian manufacturing operating conditions worsened in September, reversing the modest improvement recorded in August.\u201d Firms reported that production output and new orders fell last month, and cut jobs for the second month running. Here are the key points: Output contracts following expansion in previous month Modest reductions in new orders and foreign business Input costs fall for first time in over five years Andre Loes, chief economist for Brazil at HSBC, says Brazil\u2019s factory sector has suffered for much of 2014 \u201cAfter an incipient recovery in August (50.2), the HSBC Brazil Manufacturing PMI is back below the neutral level, at 49.3 in September. This is the fifth time the index has shown a contraction in 2014. Only two out of the eleven sub-indexes remained above 50, suggesting a broad- based weakening. With the September figure, the manufacturing PMI closes the 3Q2014 at 49.6, suggesting that the Brazilian manufacturing industry remained in contraction after shrinking in 2Q.\u201d Financial services giant PricewaterhouseCooper has announced it is creating more than 800 jobs in Belfast marking a major boost to the Northern Ireland economy today, Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald writes. More than 300 of the posts will be for trained accountants including graduates in the company\u2019s new financial services centre in the city. A further 500 will join \u201cstaff augmentation\u201d teams in PwC\u2019s global client businesses at its Belfast office. The jobs represent an investment of over \u00a340m by PwC which includes a grant of \u00a34 million from the state body Invest NI. First Minister of Northern Ireland Peter Robinson said the investment was \u201ca tremendous boost to the Northern Ireland economy and is another significant vote of confidence in Northern Ireland\u2019s talent\u201d. Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said local graduates would be \u201cthe foundation\u201d for PwC\u2019s business activities worldwide. PwC, incidentally, are Tesco\u2019s auditors, and facing a few questions after the \u00a3250m profit misreporting came to light.... Jean Claude Juncker, the EU\u2019s president designate, will be making a flying visit to Athens this Friday, the Commission\u2019s press office has announced. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: The incoming president will hold a working lunch with the Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras in Athens before leaving the capital that evening. This is Junker\u2019s second visit since it became clear he would assume the post (his first foreign visit in his new capacity was to Athens in early August). Juncker has particularly good relations with Samaras - they are both conservatives, and Greek officials credit Juncker, perhaps more than any other politician, for supporting the debt-stricken country in its most difficult hour at the height of the euro crisis. During his last visit the former Luxembourg prime minister declared that as head of the euro group of euro zone finance ministers, he had \u201cfought like a lion\u201d to keep Greece in the euro zone. The visit had been kept under close wraps and comes at a time when Samaras\u2019 fragile two-party coalition is increasingly losing popularity in the polls. Political observers says the surpise drop-in could be as much about boosting Samaras at a time when his adversary and strident anti-austerity opponent, Alexis Tsipras is stepping up his opposition. Tooday in parliament, Tsipras declared that Samaras\u2019s austerity policies have ruined Greece. Just in...new jobs data from America. And US private sector companies added 213,000 new jobs last month, according to the closely watched ADP employment report. That\u2019s slightly ahead of expectations (economists had pencilled in a 205k increase). And it suggests that Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll report, the wider measure of the US jobs market, will show that at least 200,000 new jobs were created across the whole economy in September, after sliding to just 142,000 in August. France\u2019s declaration that it won\u2019t lower its deficit below 3% until 2017 (details here) has gone down rather badly with German companies. Reuters has the details: Germany\u2019s main exporters\u2019 association, the BGA, accused France of putting the euro and the wider regional economy at risk. \u201cThe French elite has still not understood that in the 21st century you can\u2019t get competitive by printing money,\u201d BGA president Anton Boerner said, according to the text of a speech due for delivery at a conference in Berlin. Over in Greece, the IMF\u2019s mission chief to Greece, Rishi Goyal, has arrived at the Finance Ministry in Athens for today\u2019s talks over its bailout programme Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, writes that the talks won\u2019t be easy: The two sides are at odds over next year\u2019s budget, the size of the financing gap slated for 2015/16, the size of the primary surplus Greece has crowed is one of its biggest achievements, and whether Athens will need a third bailout. The government, facing stiff opposition from the radical left Syriza party now leading in all polls, is determined it does not need a new financial assistance programme. Prime minister Antonis Samaras told MPs over the weekend that Greece has exited the \u201cmemorandum\u201d accord with its creditors and will be forging ahead with tax breaks. Ireland\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen again, to 11.1% in September. The number of people claiming jobless benefits fell by 4,700 in September 2014, bringing the total down to 374,800. A year ago, as Ireland was approaching the end of its bailout programme, the unemployment rate was 12.6%. Meanwhile in Paris, the French government has unveiled its new budget, and admitted that it won\u2019t hit the EU deficit targets until 2017. The budget includes a \u20ac21bn cost-cutting plan, but even that won\u2019t bring the French deficit below 3% until two years later than previously agreed with Brussels. Finance minister Michel Sapin declared that: \u201cThese spending cuts are crucial to our credibility in the eyes of French and Europeans, they\u2019ll be fully applied.\u201d But the finance ministry was also adamant that it would not aim to cut the deficit any faster: \u201cThe French people will not be asked to make additional efforts because, although the government is aware of the seriousness of the budgetary situation ... it refuses to impose austerity.\u201d Under the latest plan, France\u2019s budget deficit will rise to 4.4% in 2015, before falling to 4.3% in 2016 and then 2.8% in 2017. France\u2019s economy is now to grow by just 0.4% this year, then 1.0% in 2015, 1.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017. Sapin admitted that: The economic prospects in France and in Europe are not the same that we were promised a few months ago. And as the FT\u2019s Hugh Carnegy reports from Paris, France made a non-too subtle call to Berlin to help stimulate Europe\u2019s economy: Mr Sapin also issued a clear call to Germany to do more to boost the eurozone\u2019s weak economy. He said that while France was \u201cfacing up to its responsibilities\u201d, surplus countries that had already had \u201cthe courage to reform\u201d needed to \u201cpose the question\u201d of what more they needed to do to recover growth.... Time for a recap. The weak eurozone economy is dragging back Britain\u2019s factories, experts say, after growth in the UK manufacturing sector fell to its lowest in 17 months. Data firm Markit\u2019s monthly PMI report came in at just 51.6 in September, rather weaker than expected, showing that growth slowed last month. New orders ground to a near-halt, amid falling demand from several European countries. Markit blamed the \u201congoing lethargy of the eurozone and the appreciation of sterling against the euro\u201d. Other analysts called it a \u201cworrying sign\u201d And Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says: \u201cEven with the continued strength of the domestic economy, the manufacturing sector looks set to end 2014 on a disappointing note. Exporters are likely to continue suffering from the strength of sterling. The pound\u2019s drop in early September was short-lived, with sterling appreciating by over 2% during the course of the month. And further signs of weakening sentiment in the euro-zone won\u2019t help exporters\u2019 endeavours either.\u201d The latest eurozone factory data is also a worry. Manufacturing growth across the euro area slowed to a near standstill in September. And there was an unwelcome surprise from Germany, where the factory sector shrank slightly, driven by falling new orders. The Ukraine crisis, and the tit-for-tat sanctions between Russia and the West, appear to be exacerbating Europe\u2019s problems, Markit says: In a sign of spreading economic malaise, Germany, Austria and Greece all joined France in reporting manufacturing downturns in September. What\u2019s especially perturbing is that Germany\u2019s PMI fell into contraction for the first time since June of last year, suggesting the region\u2019s northern industrial heartland has succumbed to the various headwinds of weak demand within the euro area, falling business and consumer confidence, waning exports due to the Ukraine crisis and Russian sanctions. Russia\u2019s factories also suffered a drop in output last month. In other news.... The City regulator has launched a full investigation into Tesco, over its \u00a3250m profit overstatement. Here\u2019s what it means. Sainsbury\u2019s has blamed tough competition and a \u201cdeflationary environment\u201d for a 2.8% drop in like-for-like sales in the last quarter. Details start here. Britain\u2019s supermarkets are leading the fallers again this morning in the City. Morrisons: down 5.6% at 158p (partly because it went \u2018ex-dividend\u2019 today) Sainsbury: down 4.5% at 239p, a six year low. Tesco: down 3.5% at 179p, an 11-year low. Another sign that all is not quite right in the global economy - Germany just sold 10-year sovereign debt at an interest below 1%. In an auction this morning, the German debt office sold \u20ac4.1bn of 10-year bunds at an average yield of just 0.93% (!). That shows investors are looking for a safe haven for their cash, and anticipate eurozone inflation (and growth) to remain low for some time. And here\u2019s Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, on the UK factory data: \u201cAfter a promising start to Q3, the growth of output and new orders continues to slow bringing a subdued outlook to the end of the quarter. Although the sector is still expanding, manufacturers are holding off raising investment levels until the economic picture, in particular the way forward on interest rates, becomes clearer. That said, it\u2019s crucial that the sector continues to invest in new product lines, innovation and manufacturing efficiencies.\u201d However, the pound has actually risen slightly against the euro today, to \u20ac1.2844. Not a surprise, given that the eurozone factory data was disappointing too (details here), but it won\u2019t help UK firms boost exports. The news that Britain\u2019s factory sector has posted its slowest growth in 17 months sent the pound down to a two-week low of $1.616 against the US dollar. The data could encourage Bank of England policymakers to leave interest rates low for longer. Jake Trask, corporate dealer at UKForex, explains: \u201cGiven the ongoing strong performance of the service and construction sectors, we still expect a February interest rate rise from the Bank of England. However, this poor manufacturing reading will add weight to the MPC doves\u2019 argument of keeping rates lower for longer.\u201d The slowdown in Britain\u2019s factories could be a blow to efforts to rebalance the economy. Rob Wood of Berenberg bank says the UK will remain \u201cheavily dependent\u201d on domestic demand and service sector growth until the Eurozone picks up again. And with Germany\u2019s factories stagnating, that might not happen imminently. With the conflict in Ukraine now frozen confidence on the content could stabilise soon. But the continuing fall in sentiment in Germany suggests a risk that it may be a couple of months yet before that happens. The uncertainty around last month\u2019s Scottish independence vote may also have hit UK factories, according to David Richardson, head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. Richardson says: \u201cThe slowdown in manufacturing is worrying, but the market is likely to settle as confidence rebounds on the back of a relatively more stable domestic political backdrop. Management teams must remain focused on building ties with foreign markets, particularly beyond the Eurozone, if they are to keep output levels in positive territory.\u201d The worrying slowdown in Britain\u2019s factory sector last month is primarily due to the weakness of the euro economy, according to David Noble, CEO of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply. Noble says: \u201cWhilst the sector is still expanding, growth is much softer than that seen in the first half of the year and indicates that growth in manufacturing may be harder to find in the final quarter of the year. \u201cThe continued weakness in Eurozone countries and the euro-sterling exchange rate appeared to particularly undermine growth in September, and resulted in near stagnation in new manufacturing orders. Demand from North America, Scandinavia and the Middle East did help to offset this slowdown. However, the EU buys up around half of all UK exports, so the slowdown in the eurozone is a serious worry. Britain\u2019s factory sector has also suffered a bad September, with growth slowing sharply. The manufacturing PMI, which measures how hundreds of UK firms performed last month, has fallen to 51.6, from 52.2 in August. That shows the weakest growth since April 2013, and is worse than expected. Markit reports that new orders slowed to near-stagnation, a message we also heard from manufacturers across Europe this morning (scroll down for more.....). New export demand fell, which Markit blamed on the strength of the pound against the euro, and \u201cweaknesses in the euro area economy\u201d. There is a glimmer of good news - job creation accelerated during September. But Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, warns that \u201cThe strong upsurge in UK manufacturing sector at the start of the year appears to have run its course.\u201d \u201cInflows of new work slowed in both domestic and export markets. Overseas demand was reined in mainly by the ongoing lethargy of the eurozone and the appreciation of sterling against the euro.\u201d And this may encourage the Bank of England not to raise interest rates soon, he adds. Reaction to follow.... Oh dear, the UK\u2019s factory sector has reported its slowest growth since spring 2013. Details to follow.... The eurozone factory sector has suffered a slowdown last month, dragged back by Germany (see here) and France (see here). The overall euro area manufacturing PMI, calculated from this morning\u2019s data from Markit, slipped to just 50.3, a 14-month low, close to stagnation. Markit says the \u201ceconomic malaise\u201d in Europe is spreading, with firms in Germany, Austria, Greece and France all reporting a downturn last month. New orders fell for the first time since June 2013, suggesting that demand for Europe\u2019s goods has fallen. And both input and output prices fell, adding to concerns over low inflation. Here are the key charts: Although Italy and Spain are highlights, the overall report is worrying. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: \u201cSeptember\u2019s eurozone PMI makes for gloomy reading. The euro area\u2019s manufacturing economy has lost the growth momentum seen earlier in the year, lurching closer to stagnation. The near-term outlook also looks worrying. Order books are now deteriorating for the first time since June of last year, suggesting output could start to fall as we move into the final quarter of the year. \u201cNot surprisingly, firms are focusing on cost-cutting, resulting in an ongoing lack of job creation and sending a depressing signal of little hope for any reduction in the region\u2019s near-record unemployment rate. \u201cCompanies are also cutting prices at the expense of profit margins as they strive to boost sales. In a sign of spreading deflationary pressures, prices fell in all countries surveyed for the first time in over a year. \u201cIn a sign of spreading economic malaise, Germany, Austria and Greece all joined France in reporting manufacturing downturns in September. What\u2019s especially perturbing is that Germany\u2019s PMI fell into contraction for the first time since June of last year, suggesting the region\u2019s northern industrial heartland has succumbed to the various headwinds of weak demand within the euro area, falling business and consumer confidence, waning exports due to the Ukraine crisis and Russian sanctions. \u201cThe weakening manufacturing sector will intensify pressure on the ECB to do more to revive the economy and no doubt strengthen calls for full- scale quantitative easing. Many will hope that this week\u2019s policy meeting will at least show a determination to address the slowdown with details of an aggressive ABS and covered bond purchase programme.\u201d The euro has fallen by almost half a cent against the US dollar to a new two-year low around $1.2595. Investors are anticipating that the unexpected (although small) contraction in Germany\u2019s factory sector raises the chances of further stimulus measures from the European Central Bank. Financial experts aren\u2019t impressed by the German PMI report: Here are the key points on Germany\u2019s unexpectedly poor manufacturing PMI report:\uf0a7 \uf0a7 New orders fall for the first time since June 2013 \uf0a7 Production growth slows further \uf0a7 Companies reduce their selling prices amid sharper drop in input costs Bad news for Germany -- growth in its factory sector has ground to a halt after 14 months of steady growth. Russian sanctions, and the weak eurozone economy, appear to be hitting Europe\u2019s largest economy. Data firm Markit has sent a shiver through the eurozone by reporting that German manufacturers suffered a fall in total new work last month. German manufacturers reported the first drop in order intakes since June 2013, with the pace of contraction the quickest since late 2012. Markit says: New work from foreign markets, meanwhile, rose marginally, albeit at the slowest pace in the current 14-month spell of growth. Survey participants attributed the weaker expansion to the Russian sanctions and subdued growth in main export destinations (e.g. China). That dragged the German factory PMI down to 49.9, showing a small contraction, and a big decline after August\u2019s 51.4. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit and author of the report, says: \u201cSeptember\u2019s manufacturing PMI results paint a worrying picture of the health of Germany\u2019s goods- producing sector. The headline PMI fell to its lowest level in 15 months, heavily weighed down by the sharpest drop in new orders since the end of 2012. Surveyed companies reported that a weakening economic environment, Russian sanctions and subdued growth in key export destinations were reasons behind the disappointing reading. France\u2019s factory sector continues to contract, though, but at a slower rate. The French manufacturing PMI came in at 48.8 in September, up from 46.9 in August. That shows that activity fell again, but at a slower rate.\uf0a7 Key points: \uf0a7 Business conditions deteriorate at slowest pace in four months \uf0a7 Rates of decline in output and new orders moderate \uf0a7 Pace of job shedding eases Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, says France\u2019s economy is a concern: \u201cAlthough the rate of contraction eased in September, the French manufacturing sector continued to struggle, with output, new orders and employment falling further. There seems to be no end in sight to the persistently weak demand environment, and the PMI data suggest that the manufacturing sector will have weighed on GDP throughout the third quarter.\u201d Good news from Italy, its factory sector has returned to growth. That\u2019s according to Markit\u2019s PMI index, anyway, which rose to 50.7 in September from 49.8 in August -- so back into expansion territory. Here are the key points from the survey: \uf0a7 Modest increases in output and employment recorded... \uf0a7 ...but new order growth slows to near stagnation \uf0a7 Output prices reduced as cost inflation hits four- month low It\u2019s encouraging news for Italy, after it fell back into recession this summer. But Phil Smith, economist at Markit, warns that the recovery remains fragile: Nowhere is this more evident than in the trend in new orders, the rate of growth of which has slowed to a crawl over the past five months. A further notable gain in new export orders pointed to the weakness coming from within the domestic market. Smith is also concerned that factories slashed prices again to stimulate demand. \u201cSeptember\u2019s survey meanwhile showed some downward movement in producer prices as manufacturers sought to support sales through discounting. The decrease in charges was only modest, but nevertheless adds to the broadening picture of deflation in the economy.\u201d Russia\u2019s factory sector lost momentum last month as export demand fell sharply. It\u2019s manufacturing PMI dropped to 50.4 -- close to the 50-point mark that shows stagnation. The sanctions imposed on Moscow over the Ukraine crisis may be hurting manufacturers. Markit reports that: While total new orders showed signs of stronger recovery, export demand plunged in September.... Employment fell further and firms cut purchasing activity for the first time since May, it added. Factories in the Netherlands grew at a faster rate in September, Markit reports: But as with Spain, manufacturers also reported that average purchasing costs fell last month, for the first time in four months. Meanwhile in the eurozone, Spain\u2019s factory sector has posted another month of growth, based on interviews with purchasing managers across the country. The Spanish manufacturing PMI for September came in at 52.8, according to Markit. Slightly lower than August\u2019s 52.8, but still showing growth (50 is the dividing line between expansion and contraction). Markit also reported that firms paid less for their raw materials, another signal of low inflation in Europe. City Index\u2019s Josh Raymond sums up the problem facing Sainsbury\u2019s et al: Coupe also defended that poster, urging staff to get customers to spend an extra 50p. Hmmmm, Sainsbury\u2019s shares have turned south, down 4% after Mike Coupe told reporters that its dividend policy would be part of its strategic review. Sainsbury\u2019s CEO Mike Coupe is holding a press call with reporters now. He has insisted that the company is \u201c100% confident\u201d that it has been accounting for its commercial income correctly. So, he doesn\u2019t believe Sainsbury has been conducting the same methods that got Tesco into such trouble..... And asked about the market, Coupe says conditions are \u201cthe most challenging\u201d he has seen in his 30-year career. My colleague Sean Farrell is on the call: Retail analyst Steve Dresserman reckons that the FCA\u2019s decision to launch a \u2018full investigation\u2019 into Tesco\u2019s is a significant development. And as this site explains, the FCA has a range of powers. It can: Investigate and take proceedings against individuals Compel individuals to attend interviews Make compulsory requests of individuals for information and documents Punish individuals by way of financial penalty, public censure and/or removal of their regulatory approvals The London stock market is open, and shares in J Sainsbury are up around 0.6% after this morning\u2019s financial results (details). The City must reckon that it could have been worse... Rival Morrison\u2019s is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, down 2.8%. Sainsbury\u2019s new chief executive, Mike Coupe, must be looking enviously at his predecessor Justin King, who enjoyed a decades-worth of rising sales before resigning to plaudits in the summer. It\u2019s rather similar to Tesco, where problems emerged shortly after Sir Terry Leahy stepped down three years ago to be replaced with the - now fired - Phil Clarke. John Ibbotson, director of the retail consultancy Retail Vision, says Coupe has a real challenge on his hands. \u201cWith these results, it\u2019s increasingly clear Mike Coupe took the hospital pass just like Philip Clarke. \u201cYes, convenience and online may be moving in the right direction but the rot is setting in. \u201cWith everyone reducing prices and food inflation low, Sainsbury\u2019s has got its work cut out.\u201d We got an insight into the situation at Sainsbury\u2019s yesterday, when it emerged that staff were being urged to get shoppers to spend an extra 50p on every visit. A motivational poster was meant to be pinned up in the staff room, but unfortunately (or not), one staff member helpfully stuck the poster up in a shop window for everyone to see. As we reported: The \u201cFifty pence challenge\u201d poster was snapped by passerby Chris Dodd, who loaded his picture onto Twitter. The image was then rapidly retweeted by more than 3,700 people. \u201cLet\u2019s encourage every customer to spend an additional 50p during each shopping trip between now and the year end,\u201d it read. Every little helps, eh? Live well with 50p less \u2026 Sainsbury\u2019s sales strategy gaffe The 2.8% drop in like-for-like sales at Sainsbury\u2019s (ex fuel) in the last quarter isn\u2019t quite as bad as some analysts had expected. City traders are predicting that Sainsbury\u2019s shares could rise by 2%-4% when trading begins shortly. The frenzied competition in Britain\u2019s supermarket sector has forced J Sainsbury to cut its sales forecasts for the second half of the financial year. New CEO Mike Coupe, who replaced veteran Justin King in the summer, warned shareholders in this morning\u2019s trading statement that the last few months have been tough, with many food prices falling (great news for customers, of course) An increase in price investment and short-term competitor promotional activity, combined with favourable commodity markets, has resulted in deflation in many areas of our food business. Coupe has now ditched the goal of growing sales in the next six months, after reporting a drop in comparable sales in the last 16 weeks. \u00b7 Total Retail sales for second quarter down 0.8% (ex fuel), down 2.3% (inc fuel) \u00b7 Like-for-like Retail sales for second quarter down 2.8% (ex fuel), down 4.1% (inc fuel) \u00b7 Total Retail sales for the first half flat ex fuel (down 1.4% inc fuel) and like-for-like sales down 2.1% ex fuel (down 3.4% inc fuel) Coupe warns: In the second quarter, our performance has been impacted by the accelerated pace of change in the grocery market, including significant pricing activity and food price deflation in many areas. These conditions are likely to persist for the foreseeable future and we now expect our like-for-like sales in the second half of the year to be similar to the first half. Big news this morning -- The Financial Conduct Authority has begun a full investigation into Tesco. The move comes nine days after the supermarket giant stunned the world of business by admitting that it overstated its profit forecasts earlier this year, by a staggering \u00a3250m. Tesco just gave the City the news in a brief statement: REGULATORY UPDATE The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has notified Tesco that it has commenced a full investigation following the overstatement of expected profit for the half year which was described in our announcement of 22 September 2014 and which is currently the subject of an independent review by Deloitte. Tesco will continue to co-operate fully with the FCA and other relevant authorities considering this matter. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. Coming up today..... a splurge of economic data from across Europe and beyond, with the monthly manufacturing PMI index. They\u2019ll show which countries managed to grow their factory sectors last month, and which ones struggled. Preliminary data released a fortnight ago showed that France was faring rather badly, with activity falling again. We\u2019ve already had mixed data from Asia overnight, with India, Japan and Taiwan all seeing slower growth, while Taiwan saw a contraction. Most of the European data comes in a rush after 8am BST, with the final eurozone figure at 9am, then the UK at 9.30am and the US at 2.45pm and 3pm (there are two rival measures, Markit and ISM). While in the City, Sainsbury is reporting its financial results for the last 16 weeks, and confirming that it is also struggling as Britain\u2019s supermarket price war deepens. Like for like retail sales for second quarter have fallen by 2.8% (ex fuel), or a chunky 4.1% if you count fuel too. There\u2019s going to be a lot of questions for new CEO Mike Coupe to answer.... (including a conference call this morning) We\u2019ll also be watching Greece as talks begin with its troika of lenders, and other breaking news through the day.....",

managed to grow their factory sectors last month, and which ones struggled. Preliminary data released a fortnight ago showed that France was faring rather badly, with activity falling again.</p> <p>We\u2019ve already had mixed data from Asia overnight, with India, Japan and Taiwan all seeing slower growth, while Taiwan saw a contraction.</p> <p>Most of the European data comes in a rush after 8am BST, with the final eurozone figure at 9am, then the UK at 9.30am and the US at 2.45pm and 3pm (there are two rival measures, Markit and ISM).</p> <p><strong>While in the City, Sainsbury is reporting its financial results for the last 16 weeks</strong>, and confirming that it is also struggling as Britain\u2019s supermarket price war deepens.</p> <p>Like for like retail sales for second quarter have fallen by 2.8% (ex fuel), or a chunky 4.1% if you count <strong>fuel</strong> too. There\u2019s going to be a lot of questions for new CEO Mike Coupe to answer.... (<em>including a conference call this morning</em>)</p> <p>We\u2019ll also be watching Greece as <a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_30/09/2014_543338\">talks begin with its troika of lenders</a>, and other breaking news through the day.....</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-10-01T07:12:28.384Z\">at 8.12am BST</time></p>  </div>",

Songbird has exchanged contracts for the sale of 50 Bank Street to Crosby Investment Holdings, owned by Vivien Chen, who as chairman of the Nan Fung group runs one of the biggest business dynasties in Hong Kong. She took control of the conglomerate in 2009 after her father, founder Chen Din Hwa, fell ill with Alzheimer\u2019s. The 11-storey office building at Bank Street, which is mostly let to asset management firm Northern Trust until 2022, generates annual rent of \u00a38.58m. There has been a steady flood of Asian capital into London property in recent years, with yields higher than in Hong Kong and Singapore. BNP Paribas Real Estate calculates that 88% of investment turnover in the City last year came from overseas investors, of which a fifth was from south-east Asian institutions. Andrew Cruickshank, senior director of international investment at BNP Paribas Real Estate, said: \u201cAlthough we have noted more competitive inquiries from the Middle Eastern investors, it still appears that Asian capital (from previously active nations such as Korea, China and Malaysia \u2013 and new entrants from Indonesia and Taiwan) will continue to dominate.\u201d He said the weakening of the pound against stronger Asian currencies, coupled with higher property taxes recently introduced in Singapore and Hong Kong, were other factors driving demand for UK commercial property. For its part, Songbird will use the sale proceeds to help fund its eastern extension of Canary Wharf, the revamp of the South Bank around the Shell Centre tower, and the construction of the 58-floor Newfoundland tower on the western edge of Canary Wharf. Nicknamed the Diamond Tower, it is Songbird\u2019s first residential building in the finance district, which houses the headquarters of some of the world\u2019s biggest banks, including Barclays and HSBC. The company is also building more than 3,000 homes at Wood Wharf on the eastern edge of Canary Wharf, ranging from townhouses to towers.",

She took control of the conglomerate in 2009 after her father, founder Chen Din Hwa, fell ill with Alzheimer\u2019s.</p> <p>The 11-storey office building at Bank Street, which is mostly let to asset management firm Northern Trust until 2022, generates annual rent of \u00a38.58m.</p> <p>There has been a steady flood of Asian capital into London property in recent years, with yields higher than in Hong Kong and Singapore. <a href=\"http://www.realestateforachangingworld.co.uk/index.php/asian-investment-continues-to-dominate-london/\" title=\"\">BNP Paribas Real Estate calculates</a> that 88% of investment turnover in the City last year came from overseas investors, of which a fifth was from south-east Asian institutions.</p> <p>Andrew Cruickshank, senior director of international investment at BNP Paribas Real Estate, said: \u201cAlthough we have noted more competitive inquiries from the Middle Eastern investors, it still appears that Asian capital (from previously active nations such as Korea, China and Malaysia \u2013 and new entrants from Indonesia and Taiwan) will continue to dominate.\u201d</p> <p>He said the weakening of the pound against stronger Asian currencies, coupled with higher property taxes recently introduced in Singapore and Hong Kong, were other factors driving demand for UK commercial property.</p> <p>For its part, Songbird will use the sale proceeds to help fund its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/22/canary-wharf-spreads-east-new-towers-wood-wharf-new-homes\" title=\"\">eastern extension of Canary Wharf</a>, the revamp of the South Bank around the Shell Centre tower, and the construction of the 58-floor Newfoundland tower on the western edge of Canary Wharf.</p> <p>Nicknamed the Diamond Tower, it is Songbird\u2019s first residential building in the finance district, which houses the headquarters of some of the world\u2019s biggest banks, including Barclays and HSBC.

      "standfirst": "Video search and ad group says revenue slowdown continued and it will only break even", 
      "body": "<p><strong>Blinkx</strong>, the video search and ad group spun out of <strong>Autonomy</strong>, has disappointed its investors for the second time in three months.</p> <p>Following a profit warning in July, the company now says that the fall in revenues seen in the first quarter has continued into the second. It has been making a push into the mobile market, which is expected to contribute $20m of the expected first half revenues of $102m to $104m. But this figure is below analysts' forecasts, as is its new prediction it will only break even for the six month period.</p> <p>In July it warned first half earnings would be around $5m below its expectations, a few months after a blog from Harvard Business School questioned aspects of its business model, claims the company rejected.</p> <p>Following this latest disappointment, analysts at the company's broker Numis summed up the situation:</p> <blockquote> Blinkx has released a trading update for the 6m to September. It indicates that revenues will be $102-4m, which compares with our estimate of $117m and at the mid-point represents a 8% year on year fall. The group expects EBITDA to be approximately breakeven, compared with our expectation for a $6m profit. <br> The group guides to a net cash balance of $115m, equal to 17p per share. The group believes that it has reached an inflexion point and has seen sequential month-on-month growth since July, with mobile now accounting for 20% of revenues. The group will provide greater detail at its interims on 11 November and we put our forecast, recommendation and target price under review until then. </blockquote> <p>David Johnson at Northland Capital said:</p> <blockquote> A disappointing update with first half revenue expected to contract around 7% over the same period last year. Given that management was reporting around 5% growth in first quarter revenue in the July update, this suggests that the second quarter has been very weak. <br> The sector continues to evolve rapidly and companies need to be very nimble to avoid being left behind. Meanwhile the likes of Google and Facebook continue to grow their advertising operations. Current price is partially underpinned by cash but there was a $12m outflow in the first half (including the acquisition of Lyfe Mobile). </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Alex DeGroote at Peel Hunt said the best option now was for someone to buy Blinkx:</p> <blockquote> Blinkx has delivered another highly material profit warning. The saving grace is net cash of around $115m. Cash burn is now a real prospect. Hence the company must seek a corporate buyer, in our view. <br> Investors will recall a fund-raising (for a deal) took place only months ago. With the company now on the cusp of losing money, the concern is thus cash burn. Other things being equal, there is around 18p per share of cash 'backstop' value.  Blinkx comments that in fact July marked an inflection point on sequential revenue trends. This remains to be seen, in terms of continuity. Likewise, developments on mobile are said to be gaining traction (now around 20% of group, albeit at much lower gross margin).  We have no formal house view on Blinx. Historical EBITDA multiples look attractive but (downward) profit momentum is alarming.

      "bodyText": "Blinkx, the video search and ad group spun out of Autonomy, has disappointed its investors for the second time in three months. Following a profit warning in July, the company now says that the fall in revenues seen in the first quarter has continued into the second. It has been making a push into the mobile market, which is expected to contribute $20m of the expected first half revenues of $102m to $104m. But this figure is below analysts' forecasts, as is its new prediction it will only break even for the six month period. In July it warned first half earnings would be around $5m below its expectations, a few months after a blog from Harvard Business School questioned aspects of its business model, claims the company rejected. Following this latest disappointment, analysts at the company's broker Numis summed up the situation: Blinkx has released a trading update for the 6m to September. It indicates that revenues will be $102-4m, which compares with our estimate of $117m and at the mid-point represents a 8% year on year fall. The group expects EBITDA to be approximately breakeven, compared with our expectation for a $6m profit. The group guides to a net cash balance of $115m, equal to 17p per share. The group believes that it has reached an inflexion point and has seen sequential month-on-month growth since July, with mobile now accounting for 20% of revenues. The group will provide greater detail at its interims on 11 November and we put our forecast, recommendation and target price under review until then. David Johnson at Northland Capital said: A disappointing update with first half revenue expected to contract around 7% over the same period last year. Given that management was reporting around 5% growth in first quarter revenue in the July update, this suggests that the second quarter has been very weak. The sector continues to evolve rapidly and companies need to be very nimble to avoid being left behind. Meanwhile the likes of Google and Facebook continue to grow their advertising operations. Current price is partially underpinned by cash but there was a $12m outflow in the first half (including the acquisition of Lyfe Mobile). Meanwhile Alex DeGroote at Peel Hunt said the best option now was for someone to buy Blinkx: Blinkx has delivered another highly material profit warning. The saving grace is net cash of around $115m. Cash burn is now a real prospect. Hence the company must seek a corporate buyer, in our view. Investors will recall a fund-raising (for a deal) took place only months ago. With the company now on the cusp of losing money, the concern is thus cash burn. Other things being equal, there is around 18p per share of cash 'backstop' value. Blinkx comments that in fact July marked an inflection point on sequential revenue trends. This remains to be seen, in terms of continuity. Likewise, developments on mobile are said to be gaining traction (now around 20% of group, albeit at much lower gross margin). We have no formal house view on Blinx. Historical EBITDA multiples look attractive but (downward) profit momentum is alarming. That being said, investors will be aware of the cash in the business, together with still-impressive revenue scale. Common sense dictates to us that Blinkx must have some attraction to a corporate buyer. Blinkx shares have fallen 4.5p to 30.75p, well off the 52 week high of 234p. Mike Lynch, who sold Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard in 2011 prompting much subsequent acrimony, is still listed as owning 17.9m shares in Blinkx, or 4.47%, although he had been gradually selling down the stake. Meanwhile HP sold its remaining shareholding at 120p a share in June last year.",
