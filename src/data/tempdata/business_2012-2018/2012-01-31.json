    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "A reputation shredded: Sir Fred loses his knighthood", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Fred Goodwin, has been stripped of his knighthood by the Queen for his role in the creation of the biggest recession since the second world war. With unceremonial haste, a committee of five senior civil servants took away the knighthood given to Goodwin by the last Labour government in 2004 for services to banking. The chancellor, George Osborne, welcoming the move, said: \"RBS came to symbolise everything that went wrong in the British economy over the past decade.\" The move provoked a cacophony of calls for honours to be stripped from other miscreant bankers, politicians and regulators. The campaign to humble Goodwin was reignited by the Daily Mail a fortnight ago and then hastily backed in a highly political move by David Cameron as he sought to show he will side with the public against crony capitalists and bonus-seeking bankers. Normally an honour is only taken away if someone has been guilty of a criminal offence punishable by longer than three months in jail, or has been stripped of their professional status by their regulator. Goodwin has suffered neither fate, but had been sharply criticised for excessive risk-taking in a report prepared by the Financial Services Authority in November into the RBS collapse. He now joins an ignominious list of individuals stripped of their honours, including Robert Mugabe, the president of Zimbabwe, and Anthony Blunt, who spied for Russia. Goodwin has no right of appeal, and in accordance with custom was given no right to make representations to the forfeiture committee, a group of five permanent secretaries. The authority to rescind an honour rests with the Queen alone. The unprecedented decision, and the corner-cutting in the procedures, helped fuel calls by Tory MPs for peers and other bankers to have their honours subjected to review by the previously obscure forfeiture committee chaired by Sir Bob Kerslake, head of the civil service. Goodwin was telephoned by Kerslake in the afternoon to be told the news. In an unusual public statement, the committee justified its decision, stating: \"The scale and the severity of the impact of his actions as chief executive officer of RBS made this an exceptional case. \"In 2008 the government had to provide \u00a320bn of new equity to recapitalise RBS and ensure its survival and prevent the collapse of confidence in the British banking system. Subsequent increases in government capital have brought the total necessary injection of taxpayers' money in RBS to \u00a345.5bn. \"Both the Financial Services Authority and the Treasury select committee have investigated the reasons for this failure and its consequences. They are clear that the failure of RBS played an important role in the financial crisis of 2008-09, which together with macroeconomic factors triggered the worst recession in the UK since the second world war and imposed significant direct costs on British taxpayers and businesses.\" It added: \"Fred Goodwin was the dominant decision maker at RBS at the time. In reaching this decision it was recognised that widespread concerns about Fred Goodwin's decision meant that the retention of a knighthood for services to banking could not be sustained.\" The Conservative MP Mark Field called for the forfeiture committee to be given powers to strip peerages from miscreants, such as those peers found guilty of fiddling their expenses. He said: \"I hope that now, if this committee feels so strong about Fred Goodwin, [it] will want to look at the various peers who have gone to prison, or who have abused their expenses. \"Let's get them booted out of the House of Lords, they have a lifelong peerage and a place in our legislature. So I hope that we will now very rapidly move to getting these people expelled from the House of Lords. Because if we're looking at the sanctity of honours, their abuse is far more serious than the mere bauble of a knighthood.\" David Ruffley, a Conservative MP on the Treasury select committee, said other risk-taking bankers and lazy regulators should also be examined. \"We need to look at other parts of the City, business and politics. We are talking about honours given by her majesty. Members of the public should write into the forfeiture committee. This should not be a one political gimmick.\" The Conservative MP Matthew Hancock backed the forfeiture committee decision but called for the heads of banks responsible for systemic failure also to be subject to criminal gross negligence charges. Political leaders rushed to welcome the decision, announced just as the prime minister was being scrutinised in the Commons over his diplomacy at the EU summit on Monday. David Cameron said: \"The FSA report into what went wrong at RBS made clear where the failures lay and who was responsible. The proper process has been followed and I think we've ended up with the right decision.\" Ed Miliband said the decision should be the start of a wider reform of the culture of banking. The CBI said: \"The business community will understand the Queen's decision to take away the knighthood awarded to Fred Goodwin for services to banking in 2004. Such an annulment is exceptional but unsurprising, given all of the circumstances.\" The CBI's former head, Lord Digby Jones, said: \"I think there is the faint whiff of the lynch mob on the village green about this, but that isn't to say that the end result isn't what is right.\" The forfeiture committee is chaired by Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the civil service. The other members are Dame Helen Ghosh, permanent secretary at the Home Office, Paul Jenkins, the Treasury solicitor, Sir Peter Housden, permanent secretary of the Scottish government, and Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary. David Fleming, Unite's national officer, said: \"It is a token gesture to strip Fred Goodwin of his knighthood, but one which will be well received by the thousands of workers who lost their jobs during his rule. Nonetheless this will do nothing to bring job security to the staff across the banking sector who continue to work under a culture of excess and greed at the top. Action from the government is needed in banking reform, not simply empty rhetoric on knighthoods or shareholder activism.\" RBS said it would not make any comment, but Sir Jackie Stewart, the former motor racing driver, was one of the few people to speak up for his friend last night. \"The recession did come, it was a global recession \u2013 it wasn't one man or one bank who created this,\" Stewart said.",

According to the Cabinet Office, he is the 35th person to have an honour withdrawn since 1995. Last year a former Manchester headteacher, Jean Else, became the first woman to have her damehood annulled. The forfeiture committee was established to ensure that the system of knighthoods, peerages and other awards was not brought into disrepute. It is composed of senior civil servants. Meeting at least once a year, the committee examines individual cases brought to its attention and reviews general policy about how the system should operate. The threshold of public disgrace required to trigger an assessment of whether an individual should have his or her honour withdrawn is based on whether he or she has either been: \u2022 found guilty by the courts of a criminal offence and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of more than three months, or; \u2022 censured or struck off by the relevant regulatory authority or professional body for actions or failures to act which are directly relevant to the granting of the honour. The committee's members include the head of the civil service, Sir Bob Kerslake, the permanent secretaries to the Home Office and the Scottish government, Dame Helen Ghosh and Sir Peter Housden respectively, the Treasury solicitor, Paul Jenkins, and the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood. The committee's recommendations are submitted to the Queen through the prime minister. Any decisions on forfeiture are formally published in the London Gazette. Another prominent figure to have lost his knighthood recently was Allen Stanford, the US and Antiguan financier, who is awaiting trial for allegedly swindling investors out of more than \u00a34.5bn. As a Commonwealth award, it was removed by a different forfeiture committee in 2010. Robert Mugabe, knighted in 1994, at a time when it was argued that it might moderate his behaviour, had the honour withdrawn in 2008 following the international furore over violent, disputed elections. Jack Lyons, a businessman and philanthropist, who was convicted for his role in the Guinness share trading scandal, was stripped of his knighthood in 1991. The Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, honoured by the British government in an attempt to improve relations within Europe during the cold war had his knighthood revoked the day before his execution by a revolutionary firing squad. Anthony Blunt, the keeper of the Queen's pictures, was knighted for his services to art only to have his status revoked in 1979 shortly after the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, had exposed his double life as a Soviet spy in parliament. Other victims of the hasty re-writing of history have included the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and the Irish patriot Roger Casement. Mussolini had been the first Italian to receive the honour. He was given the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1923 from King George V. Il Duce lost his knighthood when Italy joined Nazi Germany in 1940 in declaring war on the UK. The case of Roger Casement remains one of the most controversial forfeitures. A distinguished diplomat and human rights campaigner, he was eventually hanged for treason.

He borrowed \u20ac9m (\u00a37.5m) to invest in funds run by JC Flowers. One of his creditors was his former employer.</p> <p>While the FSA has passed details to the City of London police, there will not be criminal charges. A police source said the force had been keen to take on the case while a JC Flowers spokesman said that if a criminal investigation had been launched the firm would have cooperated fully.</p> <p>Tracey McDermott, FSA's acting director of enforcement and financial crime, said: \"Sinha exploited his position of trust as CEO to fraudulently obtain significant sums for his personal benefit. He engaged in a dishonest, deliberate and sustained course of misconduct which lasted for several months. Such behaviour has no place in the financial services industry.\"</p> <p>But Sara George, partner in the regulatory litigation team at law firm Stephenson Harwood, was critical. \"The public will have difficulty understanding why it is a checkout girl who steals \u00a310,000 from her employer should go to prison but a phenomenally wealthy individual who steals millions should not,\" she said.</p> <p>The misconduct was uncovered on 26 October 2009 just weeks before Sir Callum McCarthy, the former FSA chairman, joined as chairman of JC Flowers. By 11 November Sinha's contract had been terminated.</p> <p>\"Mr Sinha engaged in this dishonest behaviour in order to obtain additional income to meet his pressing financial obligations,\" the FSA said <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/static/pubs/final/ravi-sinha.pdf\" title=\"\">in its decision notice</a> outlining its damning assessment of Sinha's conduct.</p> <p>Born in India but brought up in Walsall, Sinha was educated at Oxford and worked at Goldman Sachs in its financial institutions group. He joined JC Flowers shortly after it was set up in 2002 by former Goldman partner Christopher Flowers.</p> <p>During the financial crisis, Sinha led the JC Flowers team which tried to buy Northern Rock but the firm's funds were themselves caught up in the meltdown and the chase was abandoned when the lender was nationalised.</p> <p>\" Sinha's personal investments were also under pressure. As their value declined and the income he received from them dried up, he had difficulty servicing his loans and meeting his financial obligations, the FSA said.</p> <p>To service the loans he had taken out to invest in JC Flowers's funds \u2013 intended to demonstrate a personal commitment to the investments that were being made \u2013 the FSA said he \"decided to abuse his position\" to \"procure payments\" from a firm in which JC Flowers invested, identified by the regulator only as company A.</p> <p>In January 2009, the FSA said Sinha approached the chief executive of company A to ask for a loan of \u20ac248,396.67. The FSA said Sinha lied, telling the chief executive that he had been authorised to take out loan, which was the exact amount of an instalment Sinha owed on a bank loan. By April 2009, Sinha was telling the same boss of company A that JC Flowers would now be charging advisory fees \u2013 even though Sinha had not sought or obtained approval to charge the fees. This brought in \u20ac400,000 on 21 May 2009, \u20ac400,000 on 29 June 2009 and \u20ac500,000 on 21 October 2009.</p> <p>Sinha argued that the FSA should take account of the damage he had suffered from his misconduct and said the sum obtained \u2013 \u00a31.367m \u2013 would have been \"eclipsed by the yet unrealised amount that would have accrued to him as his share of the carry [bonus]\".</p> <p>He also argued \"he would suffer serious financial hardship\" because of the penalties being imposed, but the FSA said it did not accept this was a reason not to press ahead.</p> <p>The FSA said Sinha \"accepted that he had engaged in the misconduct\" but he said the FSA had \"misconstrued\" comments he made to explain his actions. He said that if he had sought authorisation from his employer it would have been granted.</p> <p>The FSA accepted the fine \u2013 some \u00a31.5m in penalties and the rest for \"disgorgement\" \u2013 would probably result in Sinha suffering serious financial hardship and have the \"unfortunate result of him once again being made bankrupt\".</p> <p>Sinha emailed the Bloomberg news agency to say: \"I very much regret misleading JC Flowers over this issue and continue to offer my sincerest apologies to all those concerned. It was a foolish action which I completely regret, particularly in terms of the effect that it has had on my family. I will bear the consequences of my own actions long into the future.\"</p> <p>JC Flowers stressed that it had found the problem itself and that the FSA had not criticised its systems or controls. \"Neither the company that paid the invoices nor investors in the funds advised by JC Flowers have suffered any loss as a result of Mr Sinha's actions,\" the firm said.</p>",

A police source said the force had been keen to take on the case while a JC Flowers spokesman said that if a criminal investigation had been launched the firm would have cooperated fully. Tracey McDermott, FSA's acting director of enforcement and financial crime, said: \"Sinha exploited his position of trust as CEO to fraudulently obtain significant sums for his personal benefit. He engaged in a dishonest, deliberate and sustained course of misconduct which lasted for several months. Such behaviour has no place in the financial services industry.\" But Sara George, partner in the regulatory litigation team at law firm Stephenson Harwood, was critical. \"The public will have difficulty understanding why it is a checkout girl who steals \u00a310,000 from her employer should go to prison but a phenomenally wealthy individual who steals millions should not,\" she said. The misconduct was uncovered on 26 October 2009 just weeks before Sir Callum McCarthy, the former FSA chairman, joined as chairman of JC Flowers. By 11 November Sinha's contract had been terminated. \"Mr Sinha engaged in this dishonest behaviour in order to obtain additional income to meet his pressing financial obligations,\" the FSA said in its decision notice outlining its damning assessment of Sinha's conduct. Born in India but brought up in Walsall, Sinha was educated at Oxford and worked at Goldman Sachs in its financial institutions group. He joined JC Flowers shortly after it was set up in 2002 by former Goldman partner Christopher Flowers. During the financial crisis, Sinha led the JC Flowers team which tried to buy Northern Rock but the firm's funds were themselves caught up in the meltdown and the chase was abandoned when the lender was nationalised. \" Sinha's personal investments were also under pressure. As their value declined and the income he received from them dried up, he had difficulty servicing his loans and meeting his financial obligations, the FSA said. To service the loans he had taken out to invest in JC Flowers's funds \u2013 intended to demonstrate a personal commitment to the investments that were being made \u2013 the FSA said he \"decided to abuse his position\" to \"procure payments\" from a firm in which JC Flowers invested, identified by the regulator only as company A. In January 2009, the FSA said Sinha approached the chief executive of company A to ask for a loan of \u20ac248,396.67. The FSA said Sinha lied, telling the chief executive that he had been authorised to take out loan, which was the exact amount of an instalment Sinha owed on a bank loan. By April 2009, Sinha was telling the same boss of company A that JC Flowers would now be charging advisory fees \u2013 even though Sinha had not sought or obtained approval to charge the fees. This brought in \u20ac400,000 on 21 May 2009, \u20ac400,000 on 29 June 2009 and \u20ac500,000 on 21 October 2009. Sinha argued that the FSA should take account of the damage he had suffered from his misconduct and said the sum obtained \u2013 \u00a31.367m \u2013 would have been \"eclipsed by the yet unrealised amount that would have accrued to him as his share of the carry [bonus]\". He also argued \"he would suffer serious financial hardship\" because of the penalties being imposed, but the FSA said it did not accept this was a reason not to press ahead. The FSA said Sinha \"accepted that he had engaged in the misconduct\" but he said the FSA had \"misconstrued\" comments he made to explain his actions. He said that if he had sought authorisation from his employer it would have been granted. The FSA accepted the fine \u2013 some \u00a31.5m in penalties and the rest for \"disgorgement\" \u2013 would probably result in Sinha suffering serious financial hardship and have the \"unfortunate result of him once again being made bankrupt\". Sinha emailed the Bloomberg news agency to say: \"I very much regret misleading JC Flowers over this issue and continue to offer my sincerest apologies to all those concerned. It was a foolish action which I completely regret, particularly in terms of the effect that it has had on my family. I will bear the consequences of my own actions long into the future.\" JC Flowers stressed that it had found the problem itself and that the FSA had not criticised its systems or controls. \"Neither the company that paid the invoices nor investors in the funds advised by JC Flowers have suffered any loss as a result of Mr Sinha's actions,\" the firm said.",

      "bodyText": "Apple, the all-conquering maker of iPhones and iPads, has poached the boss of Dixons to head its network of stores across the world. John Browett, who has been chief executive of the struggling high street electronics firm since 2007, was named Apple's senior vice president of retail, reporting directly to chief executive Tim Cook. Browett, who has long been seen as a rising star of British retailing, will be charged with managing Apple's already phenomenally successful retail strategy and its rapid expansion to all corners of the globe. He said deciding to leave Dixons, which has recently been through a gruelling turnaround process, was hard. \"[But] I love Apple,\" he said. \"The thing about Apple is, it's an exceptional company, and for me to sit inside a technology company like that and see how it works is really exciting. There is no other job in the UK or elsewhere that I would have wanted.\" Browett, who said his appointment was made \"very quickly\", is the first senior executive hired by Cook since he took over from Steve Jobs as Apple's chief executive last year. Cook said he was thrilled that Browett was joining the team and described his retail experience as \"incredible\". Browett, who held a string of senior positions at Tesco, including chief executive of Tesco.com, will start his new job at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California, in April. He said his job would focus on \"global expansion and how best to serve customers\", and as a keen sailor he was excited about testing the water in San Francisco Bay. Browett replaces Ron Johnson, the inventor of Apple's \"Genius Bar\" in-store customer service centres, who left the iPhone and iPad maker last year to become CEO of US clothing chain JC Penney. Analysts said Apple's board was attracted by Browett's many years of experience in the retail sector and his performance in successfully turning around Dixons's reputation for poor customer service. Robert Gregory, analyst at Planet Retail, said: \"He is a very dynamic character and not afraid to take risks. \"One of the things he has brought to Dixons is really improving their customer service. It had a reputation for many years of having poor service. That fits in well with Apple's philosophy of making the stores a destination where people can go and really get great service.\" Gregory said he expected Browett's first job would be to ramp up Apple's expansion plans. The company is due to open 40 new stores, 30 of them outside the US and with China playing an increasingly significant role. \"The key challenge for Apple is to expand that format internationally. There is huge potential. A huge amount of people know the Apple brand, but not everybody can go into a store,\" he said. James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities Service, said it was \"not surprising\" that Apple has taken on someone \"from outside the US, given that they're going for quite significant growth in Europe and Asia-Pacific\". Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at Columino, said taking on Browett was a \"great move\" by the Californian technology powerhouse, now the most valuable company in the world by market capitalisation. \"Apple is increasingly becoming a consumer electronics company - and with the expected launch of Apple TV soon, they could use his global retail experience. \"However, it does leave Dixons in a bit of tight spot,\" he warned. \"Browett has done a great job turning Dixons around. But now it has lost its figurehead who has been leading the change in a very difficult and tough market. You don't want to lose your general when the war is not quite over.\" News of Browett's departure wiped 10% or almost \u00a350m off Dixons' market value, before the shares recovered slightly to close down 8% at 14p. Browett, 48, will be replaced by Sebastian James, who has been with the company since 2008, most recently as group operations director. Katie Bickerstaffe has been appointed to the new role of chief executive UK &amp; Ireland. \"Dixons Retail is a great business, and with the support of a very strong management team we have made excellent progress in transforming the group into the leading customer focused specialist electrical retailer in its markets,\" Browett said. \"The opportunity ahead of me is an exciting one and I leave knowing that the group has a bright future under strong leadership.\" Dixons said trading was continuing in line with a recent trading update, when it reported a 5% fall in like-for-like Christmas sales. Last week Apple reported record sales of $13bn (\u00a38.26bn) in the three months to the end of December, a 59% rise on the previous year.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Arm </strong>was one of the day's biggest gainers as markets edged higher on hopes of progress in the eurozone debt crisis.</p> <p>The chip designer, whose processors are used in most mobile phones and tablets including Apple's iPhone and iPad, said fourth quarter profits jumped 45% to \u00a369m, compared to forecasts of around \u00a355m. Full year profits rose 37% to \u00a3229.7m. Chief executive Warren East said he expected revenues for the first quarter of 2012 and the whole year to be in line with market expectations:</p> <blockquote> 2012 will bring exciting opportunities and challenges as Arm enters competitive new markets where we are well positioned to succeed with leading technology, an innovative business model and a thriving ecosystem of partners. <br> The global macro-economic situation remains uncertain and is likely to influence consumer and enterprise spending, thereby potentially impacting semiconductor revenues and industry confidence. Assuming the macro-economic situation does not deteriorate significantly we expect group dollar revenues for the full year to be at least in line with current market expectations of just over $860m [up from $785m]. </blockquote> <p>Analyst George O'Connor at Panmure Gordon pointed out that the company counts royalties a quarter in arrears, so first quarter revenues could end up being upgraded given Apple's excellent recent sales figures.</p> <p>Arm closed 12p higher at 609.5p. <strong>BSkyB</strong> was also in demand following its results, up 24.5p to 690p.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> ended 10.52 points higher at 5681.61 in the wake of the EU summit and on hopes that Greece could finally do a deal with its private bondholders, paving the way for more bail-out funds. But with disappointing US confidence and Chicago PMI data, the index came off its best levels having earlier touched 5730.</p> <p>Talk of supply disruptions due to the situations in Iran and South Sudan kept crude prices at high levels, and pushed oil company shares higher. <strong>BP</strong> added 12.4p to 470.85p and <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> A shares rose 11.5p to 2240.5p.</p> <p>But banks were under pressure after poor results from Spain's Santander, and investor concern about political pressure on the taxpayer-controlled institutions. <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> lost 0.14p to 26.62p and <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> lost 0.465p to 30.62p. <strong>Barclays</strong> ended 1p lower at 212.55p.</p> <p><strong>National Grid</strong> added 18.5p to 632p and <strong>SSE</strong> rose 14p to \u00a312.23 after trading updates from the energy companies.</p> <p>On SSE, analyst Angelos Anastasiou at Investec said the statement was slightly disappointing, but full year profits would be boosted by price increases at the end of last year, with recent cuts not yet coming into effect:</p> <blockquote> The pretax profit increase is stated as being in line with that of the past three years, which is around 2%.

      "bodyText": "Arm was one of the day's biggest gainers as markets edged higher on hopes of progress in the eurozone debt crisis. The chip designer, whose processors are used in most mobile phones and tablets including Apple's iPhone and iPad, said fourth quarter profits jumped 45% to \u00a369m, compared to forecasts of around \u00a355m. Full year profits rose 37% to \u00a3229.7m. Chief executive Warren East said he expected revenues for the first quarter of 2012 and the whole year to be in line with market expectations: 2012 will bring exciting opportunities and challenges as Arm enters competitive new markets where we are well positioned to succeed with leading technology, an innovative business model and a thriving ecosystem of partners. The global macro-economic situation remains uncertain and is likely to influence consumer and enterprise spending, thereby potentially impacting semiconductor revenues and industry confidence. Assuming the macro-economic situation does not deteriorate significantly we expect group dollar revenues for the full year to be at least in line with current market expectations of just over $860m [up from $785m]. Analyst George O'Connor at Panmure Gordon pointed out that the company counts royalties a quarter in arrears, so first quarter revenues could end up being upgraded given Apple's excellent recent sales figures. Arm closed 12p higher at 609.5p. BSkyB was also in demand following its results, up 24.5p to 690p. Overall the FTSE 100 ended 10.52 points higher at 5681.61 in the wake of the EU summit and on hopes that Greece could finally do a deal with its private bondholders, paving the way for more bail-out funds. But with disappointing US confidence and Chicago PMI data, the index came off its best levels having earlier touched 5730. Talk of supply disruptions due to the situations in Iran and South Sudan kept crude prices at high levels, and pushed oil company shares higher. BP added 12.4p to 470.85p and Royal Dutch Shell A shares rose 11.5p to 2240.5p. But banks were under pressure after poor results from Spain's Santander, and investor concern about political pressure on the taxpayer-controlled institutions. Royal Bank of Scotland lost 0.14p to 26.62p and Lloyds Banking Group lost 0.465p to 30.62p. Barclays ended 1p lower at 212.55p. National Grid added 18.5p to 632p and SSE rose 14p to \u00a312.23 after trading updates from the energy companies. On SSE, analyst Angelos Anastasiou at Investec said the statement was slightly disappointing, but full year profits would be boosted by price increases at the end of last year, with recent cuts not yet coming into effect: The pretax profit increase is stated as being in line with that of the past three years, which is around 2%. This is what we have factored in, but is at the bottom end of the 2%-5% range suggested with the interims in November. The anticipated moderate increase in profits, despite the first half fall, will have been driven by the increase in retail gas and electricity prices that SSE implemented from 14 September (plus 18% for gas and 11% for electricity). Following this, on 11 January, SSE announced that it will be cutting its standard gas tariffs by 4.5% (but not electricity) from 26 March 2012 . The fact that it is delaying the cut until 26 March means that the current winter is fully covered by the higher prices which ties-in with the group's March year end (and presumably the \"moderate\" profit growth commitment). Next year's profits, however, could struggle to meet expectations of an 8% rise. As for National Grid, Anastasiou issued a sell note: [The company] is now in the middle of its UK price control reviews, and we believe that its share price is factoring in a benign outcome. We remain wary of what might develop as the reviews progress. Morrisons fell 2.8p to 286p as latest research from Kantar Worldpanel showed its sales growth fell from 5.1% to 3.7% in the 12 weeks to 22 January. Tesco, which issued a surprise profit warning earlier this month, lost 0.4p to 319.6p as its growth fell from 3.3% to 2.1%. But online grocer Ocado jumped 6i.9p to 87.1p .After a profit warning in December and the recent announcement its finance director was leaving, news of a 16.6% rise in full year sales and losses down from \u00a312.2m to \u00a32.4m came as something of a relief. It said sales growth in the first quarter would be around 10%, in line with the final quarter of the 2011. The company also dismissed bid speculation - rumours of interest from the likes of Morrisons or Marks &amp; Spencer periodically do the rounds in the market. Elsewhere Home Retail rose 8.5p to 107.4p. The company has been tipped as a bid target a number of times recently. IT group Misys added 3.1p to 323.1p on renewed takeover talk, with previous suitor Fidelity National Information Systems free to bid again early next month. Other possible predators include Fiserv, HCl or Infosys. Traders heard talk of a price of 450p a share.

The 48-year-old Cambridge and Wharton Business School executive is swapping Dixons' headquarters in Hemel Hempstead for Apple's Infinite Loop in Cupertino, California, where he'll be in charge of one of the most profitable retail businesses in the world, the 361-strong Apple stores chain. Browett, who doesn't wear a tie and hates the typical boardroom \"suit\" approach to business life, is likely to fit in well at Apple, where the late Steve Jobs famously wore a black polo shirt and jeans at almost every public gathering. He says he's not in it for the money, but one imagines Browett, who collected \u00a31m in pay and bonuses from Dixons last year, is likely to receive a significant jump in his pay packet when he turns up in California in April. \"I am not particularly motivated by money, power or celebrity. I think that those things are frankly for the birds, I don't really care about them,\" he told the Telegraph last summer. \"What really drives me is if I can see I can make a difference, and I saw that I could do something different with Dixons. I did not foresee the consumer recession which we've had \u2013 nobody did \u2013 but are we still on plan with what we said we would do? Yes, we are.\" Two weeks ago, when Dixons presented a 5% decline in like-for-like sales over Christmas as a \"solid\" performance, most of the City's retail watchers agreed Browett had done a terrific job of turning around the high street electronics chain. Since he joined Dixons from Tesco in 2007 he's made a good stab at repairing the chain's reputation for shoddy customer service, and improving its financial position, leaving the company confident it can repay a make-or-break \u00a3160m bond later this year. The 5% decline in sales, which was mainly caused by economic problems affecting its operations in Greece and Italy, was welcomed by the City. Philip Dorgan, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the performance pointed to light at the end of the tunnel for Dixons, which has lost 90% of its market value since the dotcom bubble burst in 2001. \"The most important trading period of the year is over and with other retailers dropping like flies, these numbers have to be mildly encouraging. We think that it can repay its bonds this year, helped by planned lower capital expenditure and cost savings.\" Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said he was \"thrilled\" that Browett was joining the team and described his retail experience as \"incredible\". Born in Rutland in 1963, Browett was educated at the local state school and sixth form before studying zoology at Magdalene College, Cambridge. Picking up a 2:2 degree, he joined investment bank Kleinwort Benson. After five years, he moved to America's Wharton business school, spending $100,000 (\u00a350,438) to study for his MBA. This was followed by a stint in management consulting, until he joined Tesco in 1998 at the age of 34 and became chief executive of its online operations in 2000. Which doesn't seem to have been a barrel of laughs. \"I don't do lunch. I don't do conferences. We are too busy. I just don't meet people \u2013 there is too much to do,\" he told the Guardian at the time. Browett, who had a long-held ambition to be a chief executive, is understood to have been keen to quit Tesco when it became clear that he was not in the running to take over from Sir Terry Leahy, who stood down as chief executive of Britain's biggest retailer in March 2011. The 48-year-old is a health and fitness fanatic, who used to cycle from his home in Highgate, north London, to Tesco's corporate offices in Welwyn Garden City. Browett, who's highly regarded by City analysts, has also confessed to being a fan of both Mozart and Madonna, and once got down and dirty while doing up a country house. Another of his passions is dinghy sailing, so he'll probably be glad to know San Francisco Bay boasts perfect sailing conditions almost the whole year round.",

      "bodyText": "Francis Maude cannot add up. That seems to be the conclusion of a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies into the public sector pensions row. Worse, his lack of mathematical skills provoked an unnecessary strike that cost many millions of pounds in lost output. It also succeeded in making public sector employees even more suspicious of the coalition government than they were already. The report on Tuesday follows a similar review by the independent pensions expert John Ralfe, who concluded the same. In short, Maude, the paymaster-general, added a series of \"structural reforms\" to an already tabled agenda of pension cuts that offered little or no gain for the exchequer over the longer term. The IFS says the trade-offs between various reforms are such that it is hard tell if there is any gain for the exchequer, and if there is, it is in too tiny a measure. Without wishing to put words in the mouth of the IFS, it also makes it a package of reforms that are not worth defending up to and including a strike. The problem for Maude was that he promised Tory backbenchers he would be saving tens of millions of pounds from the public pensions bill. When the unions threatened to strike, Maude said bring it on. We know the rest. What was unclear until the IFS and Ralfe reached for their calculators was that the reforms were offset by other measures. As Ralfe says: \"These reforms implement the core recommendations of the Hutton report to increase the retirement age in line with the state pension age and to move from a final salary to a career average arrangement. \"These structural changes follow the secondary changes already made to increase pensions in payment in line with CPI, not RPI, from April 2011 and to increase employee contributions by an average of 3.2%, to be phased in from April 2012.\" All the pain for workers is in the second paragraph of Ralfe's statement. This was virtually agreed with unions as the price of maintaining a guaranteed retirement scheme. Nobody liked it, but there wasn't a strike ballot planned to defend the RPI link. The move to the lower CPI inflation measure was the single biggest cut because public sector pension funds must calculate retirement incomes with inflation included and CPI averages 0.7% lower each year than RPI. Going back to the first paragraph, the rise in the pension age is largely offset by a rise in the accrual rate used to build up pension rights. So the conclusion of the IFS is that: \"The pension reforms just negotiated will make little or no difference to the long-term costs of public service pensions. The savings from higher pension ages are, on average, offset by other elements of the pensions becoming more generous.\" Maude's miscalculations gave workers a reason to strike against the whole package of measures, which is not a very clever idea from the minister's point of view and one Tory backbenchers might want to ponder.",

Full year profits rose 37% to \u00a3229.7m. Chief executive Warren East said he expected revenues for the first quarter of 2012 and the whole year to be in line with market expectations:</p> <blockquote> 2012 will bring exciting opportunities and challenges as Arm enters competitive new markets where we are well positioned to succeed with leading technology, an innovative business model and a thriving ecosystem of partners. <br> The global macro-economic situation remains uncertain and is likely to influence consumer and enterprise spending, thereby potentially impacting semiconductor revenues and industry confidence. Assuming the macro-economic situation does not deteriorate significantly we expect group dollar revenues for the full year to be at least in line with current market expectations of just over $860m [up from $785m]. </blockquote> <p>Analyst George O'Connor at Panmure Gordon pointed out that the company counts royalties a quarter in arrears, so first quarter revenues could end up being upgraded given Apple's excellent recent sales figures.</p> <p>Arm is currently 30p higher at 627.5p, the biggest riser in the leading index. Julian Yates at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> Arm is guiding sales to be in line with market expectations, but we would see consensus shifting up. We are towards the higher end of consensus and leave our forecast intact for now, but see the stock going better on these numbers and outlook.

      "bodyText": "As the market regains ground on hopes of progress in the Greek drama, Arm is leading the way after forecast beating figures. The chip designer, whose processors are used in most mobile phones and tablets including Apple's iPhone and iPad, said fourth quarter profits jumped 45% to \u00a369m, compared to forecasts of around \u00a355m. Full year profits rose 37% to \u00a3229.7m. Chief executive Warren East said he expected revenues for the first quarter of 2012 and the whole year to be in line with market expectations: 2012 will bring exciting opportunities and challenges as Arm enters competitive new markets where we are well positioned to succeed with leading technology, an innovative business model and a thriving ecosystem of partners. The global macro-economic situation remains uncertain and is likely to influence consumer and enterprise spending, thereby potentially impacting semiconductor revenues and industry confidence. Assuming the macro-economic situation does not deteriorate significantly we expect group dollar revenues for the full year to be at least in line with current market expectations of just over $860m [up from $785m]. Analyst George O'Connor at Panmure Gordon pointed out that the company counts royalties a quarter in arrears, so first quarter revenues could end up being upgraded given Apple's excellent recent sales figures. Arm is currently 30p higher at 627.5p, the biggest riser in the leading index. Julian Yates at Investec said: Arm is guiding sales to be in line with market expectations, but we would see consensus shifting up. We are towards the higher end of consensus and leave our forecast intact for now, but see the stock going better on these numbers and outlook. We keep hold given the valuation. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 40.83 points at 5711.92 in the wake of Monday's EU summit and hopes a deal to bail out Greece can be reached in the next few days.
