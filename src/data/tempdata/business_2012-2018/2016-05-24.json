      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s leading tax and spending thinktank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has warned that leaving the European Union would force ministers to extend austerity measures by up to two years to achieve a budget surplus. In a blow to the Vote Leave campaign, the fiercely independent IFS said the impact of lower GDP growth and extra borrowing costs would knock a \u00a320bn to \u00a340bn hole in the government\u2019s finances by 2020 and leave ministers struggling to balance the books before 2022, two years later than forecast. The intervention comes after a string of warnings from UK and international bodies highlighting the risks of leaving the EU, but is the first to assess the likely impact on the exchequer. In a move that will put further pressure on an already embattled Vote Leave campaign, the thinktank disputed the claim that the UK sends \u00a3350m to Brussels every week, saying the figure was more like \u00a3150m once the rebate was deducted from the total and funds for research and business subsidies are taken into account. The IFS said that even on an optimistic forecast for the UK\u2019s economic performance after leaving the EU, the \u00a3150m financial benefit would not compensate for a loss of income from falling foreign investment and overseas trade that would leave taxpayers to pick up a huge bill. Carl Emmerson, IFS deputy director and an author of the report, said: \u201cThe precise effects of leaving the EU on the British economy and hence the knock-on impact on the public finances is uncertain. But the overwhelming weight of analysis suggests that the economy would shrink by more than enough to offset the positive effect on the public finances of the reduced financial contribution to the EU budget.\u201d Boris Johnson and the Vote Leave campaign have made the \u00a3350m claim a key campaign issue and have argued strenuously that it is legitimate to say the money can be used for extra public spending or tax cuts following a vote for Brexit. Earlier this week, Johnson dismissed a report by the Treasury that claimed house prices could fall by as much as 18% following a leave vote and that households would be \u00a32,300 worse off by 2030. George Osborne said the short-term economic impact of Brexit would trigger a recession and mean GDP was 3.6% lower after two years than it would be if Britain votes to remain. However, the IFS said: \u201cIgnoring the rebate is clearly inappropriate. It is equivalent to suggesting that were the UK to leave the EU and not make any financial contribution to the EU\u2019s budget then remaining EU members would continue to pay the rebate to the UK. That is clearly absurd.\u201d Deducting the rebate brings down the UK\u2019s EU contribution from more than \u00a318bn a year to \u00a314.4bn, while support for British regions, agriculture and infrastructure projects brings the net total down to \u00a38bn, the IFS said. Paying to join the European Economic Area, as Norway does, would cost an estimated \u00a34bn. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the IFS analysis showed an economic shock following Brexit would hit the public finances and put at risk the fragile recovery. \u201cThings could be even worse if a Tory Brexit led to more austerity to try and meet George Osborne\u2019s self-imposed and self-defeating deficit targets,\u201d he said. The IFS report used forecasts by the National Institute for Economic &amp; Social Research (NIESR) to judge the impact of Brexit on the economy and then used its own experts to judge the impact on the public finances. NIESR\u2019s forecasts were based on two scenarios, which envisaged the UK paying to remain inside the European Economic Area, and another that left firms to export to the rest of the world based on World Trade Organisation rules. An optimistic and pessimistic forecast was drawn up for each forecast. Much of the impact will come from higher borrowing costs as Britain\u2019s debt rating is downgraded and international investors lose confidence in the UK. Falling property prices will hit stamp duty tax receipts and tighter immigration rules will limit GDP growth, according to NIESR\u2019s predictions. Under the most optimistic forecast where the UK joins the EEA, the IFS said the impact on the government\u2019s finances would amount to \u00a320bn by 2020. If the UK is left out in the cold and struggles to reach trade deals with the EU and the rest of the world, the cost could be \u00a340bn. Vote Leave countered that the IFS had underestimated the UK\u2019s annual net contribution to the EU by more than \u00a32bn and based its forecasts on NIESR figures that \u201chave been wrong time and time again on the EU\u201d. Andrea Leadsom MP, the energy minister, said: \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder people are being turned off this debate given the continuous campaign to do down the British economy from EU-funded organisations. \u201cSo many of these studies are based on entirely negative assumptions about our economy and the future decisions a UK government outside the EU would make, but ignore the pressing need of EU countries to continue trading with the UK. \u201cThey also ignore the very real risk of what will happen if we vote in; more money and power to a Brussels interested only in propping up an ailing eurozone.\u201d The IFS director, Paul Johnson, said economists that forecast a bright future for the UK outside the EU were in a minority. \u201cThere is an overwhelming consensus among those who have made estimates of the consequences of Brexit that it would reduce national income in both the short and long runs. The economic reasons for this \u2013 increased uncertainty, higher costs of trade and reduced foreign direct investment \u2013 are clear. \u201cOur estimates suggest that the overall effect of Brexit would be to damage the public finances. On the basis of estimates by NIESR, the effect could be between \u00a320bn and \u00a340bn in 2019\u201320, more than enough to wipe out the planned surplus. In the long run, lower GDP would likely mean lower cash levels of public spending. \u201cTo put this in context, dealing with the public finance effect would require at least an additional one or two years of \u2018austerity\u2019 \u2013 spending cuts or tax rises \u2013 at the same rate as we have experienced recently to get the public finances back to balance,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "Mark Carney should keep cool on Brexit. He's done nothing wrong", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mark Carney doesn\u2019t help himself by sounding so irritated when asked an awkward question. If you\u2019re governor of the Bank of England, it\u2019s best to remain good-humoured even when Jacob Rees-Mogg is prodding you in the ribs. But let\u2019s stick to what Carney and the Bank have actually said about Brexit. On the facts, they\u2019ve done nothing wrong. It would be odd if Threadneedle Street, with a mandate to promote monetary and financial stability, had nothing to say about a referendum that has potential consequences on both fronts. That was the context in which Carney set his warning last month that \u201ca vote to leave the EU could have material economic effects \u2013 on the exchange rate, on demand and on the economy\u2019s supply potential.\u201d His comment about sterling is a statement of the bleedin\u2019 obvious: you only have to observe how the currency markets twitch with opinion polls to appreciate the point. And, post-Brexit, speculation about the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU could surely dampen economic activity, if only because some companies would delay investment decisions. This is hardly mischievous political meddling on Carney\u2019s part, as Rees-Mogg thinks. Rather, it is an unremarkable economic analysis that many in the leave camp share. Some of those Brexiters argue the short-term pain would be worth it in the end \u2013 either because the UK\u2019s trade elsewhere would bloom, or because we would achieve greater distance from the dysfunctional eurozone. If Carney strayed into that territory \u2013 from either direction \u2013 he would have overstepped the mark. But he didn\u2019t. Meanwhile, Rees-Mogg\u2019s intended googly \u2013 why is the Bank talking now when it is silent during general elections? \u2013 didn\u2019t threaten the stumps. Referendums really are different: they are about single issues and their outcome is binding immediately. Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, had it right when he said Carney &amp; co would have had a harder time if they had taken \u201ca vow of omerta\u201d on the referendum. Quite. Let the Bank speak about risks \u2013 that\u2019s its job. Standard Life man makes stand against Shell auditor EY Boardroom pay grabs all the attention in the corporate governance wars, so well done Guy Jubb of Standard Life for demonstrating there\u2019s more to it. Jubb has kicked up a fuss about Shell\u2019s appointment of EY \u2013 the former Ernst &amp; Young \u2013 as its auditor. Standard Life voted against EY at Tuesday\u2019s meeting and collected some co-travellers. Around 7.5% of votes were cast against EY \u2013 not a big rebellion, but enough to spoil the usual 99%-plus majority enjoyed by auditors. Standard Life\u2019s complaint is that Shell\u2019s new audit partner at EY is the fellow who did the same job at recently acquired BG Group. That arrangement is obviously problematic: Shell has bet its future on the \u00a335bn takeover and now its lead auditor will be making judgments on assets that he had signed off in his last job. Objectivity could be impaired, argues Standard Life. Shell, naturally, argues that \u201cappropriate safeguards are in place\u201d and that potential conflicts of interest can be managed. Too fussy. Just get a fresh pair of eyes on the job. Hypersensitive Exxon bans Guardian from AGM Keep it in the ground, this newspaper has argued for ages on fossil fuels. Then keep out of our annual meeting, replies ExxonMobil. Or, to quote Exxon\u2019s media relations manager, Alan Jeffers: \u201cWe are denying your request [to attend Wednesday\u2019s meeting] because of the Guardian\u2019s lack of objectivity on climate change reporting demonstrated by its partnership with anti-oil and gas activists and its campaign against companies that provide energy necessary for modern life, including newspapers.\u201d Corporate arrogance-cum-hypersensitivity on this scale is rare these days. One suspects Exxon\u2019s board is still cross that it has lost its battle to prevent resolutions on climate change being put to the meeting. The New York State Retirement Fund \u2013 backed by investors from around the world \u2013 has been allowed by the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission to table a proposal that would oblige Exxon to publish an annual assessment of the effect on its business of governments\u2019 policies to limit climate change. Oil industry rivals BP, Shell and Statoil have willingly supported and adopted similar proposals. Exxon, by contrast, seems determined to resist, just as it refuses to contemplate the possibility that some of its shareholders may sympathise with the Guardian\u2019s reporting and wish to read a firsthand account of the meeting.

    "webTitle": "BHS collapse: former Mothercare and Burton chief leads rescue bid", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A former managing director of Mothercare and Burton is leading a bid for BHS backed by a wealthy Portuguese family, which has emerged as the frontrunner to rescue the department store chain. Greg Tufnell, the brother of former England cricketer Phil Tufnell, has been holding talks with administrators. It is understood that Tufnell aims to become BHS chairman. He is working alongside Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Jos\u00e9 Maria Soares Bento, thought to working with a wealthy family in Portugal. Administrators have been told that the family is willing to pump tens of millions of pounds into reviving BHS. Tufnell did not respond to requests for comment. Mystery still surrounds the identity of the family, but City sources say it is the Soares dos Santos family. The family control Jer\u00f3nimo Martins, the Portuguese supermarket group, although any potential investment in BHS is likely to be through SFMS, the family holding company. However, representatives of the Dos Santos family said last night they were not involved in talks to rescue BHS. The Tufnell-led team has emerged as the frontrunner after other parties either submitted lower bids or backed away from a deal. They registered a new vehicle called Richess Group Limited at Companies House on 12 May, with Tufnell, De Scossa and Soares Bento named as directors. Liquidators have been lined up in case the talks break down, however. If Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrators, cannot secure a deal by the end of the week then liquidators are likely to be brought in, meaning all 11,000 BHS workers could lose their jobs. Hilco, the investment firm, is in pole position to be named as liquidator. Among the other bidders, John Hargreaves, the founder of Matalan, is thought to have balked at the cost of replenishing BHS\u2019s stock, while Crown Crest, the parent company of Poundstretcher, and Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct had their proposals rejected. Tufnell describes himself as a specialist in retail turnarounds. He was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994, before becoming managing director of menswear chain Burton, which is part of Arcadia, now owned by Sir Philip Green. In 1997 he became managing director of Mothercare, the baby clothing and equipment retailer. He stepped down in 2000. Since then Tufnell has been involved in setting up a number of smaller companies and leading the buy-outs of small retailers. He is the managing partner of Prime Advantage, a boutique corporate finance firm, and a non-executive director of The House of Britannia, which invests in small luxury brands. It is unclear whether either of these companies are involved in the BHS rescue deal or whether Tufnell is acting in a personal capacity. BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit valued at about \u00a3571m. The retailer has been saddled with the deficit despite Sir Philip Green and other investors collecting more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership. The retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by three-time bankrupt Dominic Chappell. Retail Acquisitions received payments of more than \u00a325m from BHS during its 13-month ownership of the retailer. Two directors of Retail Acquisitions, which was 90% owned by Chappell, announced they were resigning on Tuesday night. Eddie Parladorio, a lawyer, and Aidan Treacy, the acting finance director of BHS in March and April 2016, said they were leaving the vehicle that owned BHS. In a statement, Parladorio said: \u201cThe acquisition and then turnaround of the iconic BHS business was always going to be challenging. Many good people worked very hard and many good things were done with some decent progress made but, in the end, the completion of the task proved beyond reach. It is to be hoped that a buyer will soon be found to take the business forward and restore it to its once very proud place on the British high street.\u201d Treacy said that \u201cexceptionally poor trading together with shortfall on property proceeds and challenges around trade credit\u201d had led to the downfall of BHS. Parladorio will give evidence to MPs next month about the demise of BHS. MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee and the work and pensions committee are investigating the retailer\u2019s collapse. The committee was told on Monday that Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail business was warned before the sale of BHS that Chappell had been declared bankrupt and lacked experience in the retail industry. Paul Budge, the finance director of Arcadia, admitted the company was aware that Chappell had been declared bankrupt at least once and was \u201ccautious\u201d about the sale. However, he and a collection of Arcadia executives defended the decision to sell BHS to Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions, despite the company collapsing into administration 13 months after the deal. \u201cWe seriously believed there was a credible business plan and seriously believed he was surrounded by credible people,\u201d Budge said. The hearings will continue on Wednesday, when MPs will hear from BHS pension trustees and the advisers to Retail Acquisitions.",

    "webTitle": "Clydesdale Bank hit by \u00a3450m of new PPI charges", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The cost of payment protection insurance (PPI) payouts continues to hang over Clydesdale Bank after it announced a \u00a3450m charge for the mis-selling scandal in its first results as a stock market-listed company. Officially known as CYBG since being spun out of National Australia Bank (NAB) earlier this year, the bank is trying to cut costs to bolster its profitability as an independent entity. When NAB sold the business, which includes Yorkshire Bank, it pledged to cover \u00a31.7bn of any future PPI bills, and this has cushioned the latest \u00a3450m charge on CYBG\u2019s profits. The standalone bank is taking only \u00a344m of the cost of the PPI provision. The demerger of the bank was a milestone for NAB, which first revealed the CYBG\u2019s \u00a3450m PPI charge when it published its own results earlier this month. NAB had faced years of speculation about its troublesome UK operations, which had taken hits for the PPI scandal as well as for mis-selling of complex interest rate insurance to small businesses. CYBG has 274 branches, 40 business banking centres and employs 7,268 staff across the UK.

      "bodyText": "ExxonMobil will face a revolt from some of its biggest and most influential shareholders on Wednesday as they fight to force the world\u2019s largest oil company to open up about the effect of climate change on its future profits. Investors managing more than $10tn (\u00a36.9tn) of assets will vote in favour of a resolution calling on Exxon to \u201cpublish an annual assessment of long term portfolio impacts of public climate change policies\u201d following the Paris Agreement to limit the global temperature rise to less than 2C (3.6F). The resolution up for discussion at Exxon\u2019s annual meeting in Dallas has been proposed by the New York state comptroller, a trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, the third largest US pension fund, and the Church of England. More than 30 of Exxon\u2019s largest shareholders, including the pension funds of the governments of Norway, Canada and California, Legal &amp; General Investment Management and Schroder\u2019s, have said they will also vote in favour of the motion. Other supporters of the motion include the pension funds of local authority workers in Greater Manchester and Tyne &amp; Wear. Edward Mason, head of responsible investment for the Church Commissioners for England, which manages \u00a36.7bn ($9.8bn) of the Church\u2019s of England\u2019s assets, said he was delighted that so many big institutional investors had come out in favour of the motion. \u201cThe resolution is part of a much wider trend following the Paris Agreement for investors to ask companies to improve disclosure on how they are positioned for the risks and opportunities posed by climate change,\u201d he said as he prepared to make the case for the motion at the AGM in Dallas\u2019s Morton H Meyerson symphony center. The resolution is also supported by ISS and Glass Lewis, the world\u2019s leading proxy advice services which advise institutional investors how to vote on such issues. If passed, the resolution would call for Exxon to publish an annual assessment of how governments\u2019 climate change policies could affect its business and profitability. The resolution states that the company \u201cshould analyze the impacts on ExxonMobil\u2019s oil and gas reserves and resources under a scenario in which reduction in demand results from carbon restrictions and related rules or commitments adopted by governments consistent with the globally agreed upon 2 degree target\u201d. Exxon has called on its investors to reject the resolution. The company had tried to block the resolution altogether, but the US Securities and Exchange Commission regulator ruled that it must include the resolution among Wednesday\u2019s votes. Chevron faces a similar vote at its AGM, also on Wednesday. The company told investors it already does enough to inform them about the impacts of climate change policy on it business, and it believes all of its hydrocarbon reserves will still be required to drive prosperity around the world. \u201cExxonMobil believes that producing our existing hydrocarbon resources is essential to meeting growing global energy demand,\u201d the company said in its proxy statement to investors. \u201cWe enable consumers \u2013 especially those in the least-developed and most-vulnerable economies \u2013 to pursue higher living standards and greater economic opportunity.\u201d More than 1,000 leading academics have written to Exxon and Chevron\u2019s 20 biggest investors urging them to support the resolutions. Among the signatories are Lord Rees of the University of Cambridge, Professor Bob Eccles from the Harvard Business School and Dr Gernot Wagner of the Harvard University Center for the Environment. Exxon is currently under investigation by New York\u2019s attorney general over claims that it lied to the public and shareholders about the risks of climate change. It follows reports that internal company documents from the 1980s and 90s show Exxon\u2019s in-house scientists were warning company executives about the dangers of climate change, while Exxon was publicly claiming that climate science was not proven. At the time, an Exxon spokesman said: \u201cWe unequivocally reject the allegations that ExxonMobil has suppressed climate change research.\u201d Exxon has banned the Guardian from reporting from inside its annual meeting. \u201cWe are denying your request because of the Guardian\u2019s lack of objectivity on climate change reporting demonstrated by its partnership with anti-oil and gas activists and its campaign against companies that provide energy necessary for modern life, including newspapers,\u201d a spokesman said.",

The UK\u2019s second-largest mortgage lender revealed it was researching new products as it admitted profits will come under pressure in coming months as competition heats up. Even so the mutual\u2019s new chief executive, Joe Garner \u2013 who joined from BT earlier this year \u2013 said attractive rates could still be offered to the members who own the building society by generating a profit of \u00a31bn-1.5bn a year. \u201cAs a building society with a core social purpose we go out in search of customer need rather than profit \u2026 Younger people are asking, \u2018How do I get a get a foot on the housing ladder\u2019 and older people are asking, \u2018How do I stay in my house for longer but access some of the capital within it\u2019,\u201d said Garner. Chris Rhodes, the Swindon-based lender\u2019s retail director, said: \u201cWe are looking at how can you create a product that allows wealth to be transferred from parent to children in order to fund house purchase [and] how you can unlock wealth in a property and stay in the property for longer.\u201d He stressed that no product was yet ready for launch. The lender ruled out lifting borrowing limits to 100% of the value of a property although it recently increased the age at which it will allow mortgages to be repaid, from 75 to 85. The society reported its highest mortgage lending since before the financial crisis, taking a 13.7% market share with \u00a332.6bn of all lending. Its share of new lending \u2013 which strips out mortgages being repaid \u2013 was 21.4%. Garner also added that the uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum on 23 June was also likely to knock UK economic activity in the short term but insisted this would not have a major impact on the housing market. Chancellor George Osborne has warned house prices could fall 18% over the next two years if the UK votes to leave the 28-member union. \u201cWe do think there is a risk of some uncertainty in the period around the referendum itself. Regardless of outcome, people will still need homes to live in and want to save for their future,\u201d said Garner. Assuming the uncertainty around the referendum lifts, Nationwide expects UK economic growth to move back towards its long-term trend rate of 2% to 2.5% and expects the housing market to remain resilient. He was upbeat about the results for the financial year ending on 4 April, pointing to the 9% rise in underlying profits to \u00a31.3bn and a rise in the number of current accounts opened at the UK\u2019s biggest mutually owned lender. It is unusual for Nationwide to appoint a chief executive from outside its own ranks and Garner replaced Graham Beale, who took the helm just before the onset of the 2008 banking crisis. Garner, who used to work at HSBC, played down the need for radical reform at the UK\u2019s biggest building society. Buy-to-let lending represents 22% of all its new business, up from 18% the previous year, and it also has a focus on London, which it warned could face turbulence in house prices. \u201cDemand in London has in part been driven by the growth in buy-to-let activity [which is more heavily concentrated in London] and there is a risk that the stretched affordability and yield metrics, combined with a change in economic conditions or reduced investor demand, could cause a correction to house prices,\u201d Nationwide said. Nationwide announced in April that it was tightening up its criteria for lending to buy-to-let landlords in the face of tax changes that reduce tax relief on their interest payments from 40% to 20% over five years. \u201cLandlords can only borrow up to 75% of a property\u2019s value, instead of the current 80%, and prove that their rental income is at least 145% of their monthly mortgage payments, higher than the industry norm of 125%. Profits on a statutory basis, which including the \u00a346m contribution to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, and other items, were \u00a31.2bn, up 23%. There was a rise in provisions for customer redress to \u00a3127m from \u00a359m, with much of the increase relating to payment protection insurance (PPI).",

      "bodyText": "Revenues at Spotify, the world\u2019s biggest music streaming service, surged 80% last year to nearly \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.5bn) but losses widened as it invested heavily amid tough competition from the likes of Apple Music and Tidal. Revenues jumped to \u20ac1.95bn, as the growth rate accelerated from 45% in 2014 and 74% in 2013. Most of the firm\u2019s revenues comes from subscriptions, which rose 78% to \u20ac1.7bn, while advertising revenues nearly doubled to \u20ac196m. The Swedish company said: \u201cIn many ways, it was our best year ever.\u201d Spotify offers music lovers access to more than 30m songs and charges a fee of \u00a39.99 a month for its premium subscription service, but also has a free service, which features advertising. It had 89m active monthly users at the end of 2015, up from 60m a year earlier. The company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, Daniel Ek, said in March that Spotify had 30m paying users. Even so, Spotify \u2013 which has yet to make a profit since launching in 2008 \u2013 slid deeper into the red. Net losses widened to \u20ac173m last year, from \u20ac162m in 2014. Spotify\u2019s royalty and distribution fees, paid to music labels, artists and other copyright holders, rose 85% to \u20ac1.63bn in 2015. English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran was the most streamed artist in the UK last year with more than 59 million listeners, despite no new material \u2013 and is now the most streamed artist of all time on Spotify, overtaking Eminem. Rihanna was the most streamed female artist of 2015 in the UK and globally, with 57 million listeners. The most streamed album was Beauty Behind the Madness from The Weeknd, which was streamed by 60 million listeners. Spotify stepped up investment amid growing competition. Apple launched a streaming service last year and rapper Jay-Z has founded Tidal. Other rivals include France-based Deezer and US-based Rhapsody, which also operates as Napster. Spotify launched Discover Weekly, which generates a personalised playlist of songs, started offering video and podcast features in January and teamed up with Starbucks in the US to bring in new subscribers. After pausing its international expansion last year, the firm added Indonesia as its 59th country this year. The financial results were filed by its Luxembourg-based holding company Spotify Technologies. It said: \u201cWe believe our model supports profitability at scale. We believe that we will generate substantial revenues as our reach expands and that, at scale, our margins will improve. We will therefore continue to invest relentlessly in our product and marketing initiatives to accelerate reach.\u201d A recent industry report showed that global digital music revenues overtook the takings from CDs and vinyl records for the first time last year. However, Spotify has yet to convince its critics that it can make money. The firm, the biggest service of its kind, has been the target of much of the criticism directed at music streaming by Radiohead, Adele and others, with Taylor Swift pulling her entire back catalogue from Spotify in 2014. Undaunted, Spotify, which is controlled by its founders, Ek and fellow Swede Martin Lorentzon, plans a stock market flotation in the next few years. It raised \u20ac890m in its most recent funding round from private equity group TPG, Goldman Sachs and hedge fund Dragoneer. French rival Deezer pulled plans for a float last autumn, blaming difficult market conditions.",

      "body": "<p>Revenues at Spotify, the world\u2019s biggest music streaming service, surged 80% last year to nearly \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.5bn) but losses widened as it invested heavily amid tough competition from the likes of Apple Music and Tidal.</p> <p>Revenues jumped to \u20ac1.95bn, as the growth rate accelerated from 45% in 2014 and 74% in 2013. Most of the firm\u2019s revenues comes from subscriptions, which rose 78% to \u20ac1.7bn, while advertising revenues nearly doubled to \u20ac196m.</p> <p>The Swedish company said: \u201cIn many ways, it was our best year ever.\u201d</p> <p>Spotify offers music lovers access to more than 30m songs and charges a fee of \u00a39.99 a month for its premium subscription service, but also has a free service, which features advertising. It had 89m active monthly users at the end of 2015, up from 60m a year earlier. The company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, Daniel Ek, said in March that Spotify had 30m paying users.</p> <p>Even so, Spotify \u2013 which has yet to make a profit since launching in 2008 \u2013 slid deeper into the red. Net losses widened to \u20ac173m last year, from \u20ac162m in 2014. Spotify\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/29/spotify-lawsuit-musicians-cracker-alleged-unpaid-royalties\">royalty and distribution fees</a>, paid to music labels, artists and other copyright holders, rose 85% to \u20ac1.63bn in 2015.</p> <p>English singer-songwriter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/01/drake-most-streamed-artist-spotify-2015\">Ed Sheeran was the most streamed artist in the UK</a> last year with more than 59 million listeners, despite no new material \u2013 and is now the most streamed artist of all time on Spotify, overtaking Eminem. Rihanna was the most streamed female artist of 2015 in the UK and globally, with 57 million listeners. The most streamed album was Beauty Behind the Madness from The Weeknd, which was streamed by 60 million listeners.</p> <p>Spotify stepped up investment amid growing competition. Apple launched a streaming service last year and rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/03/tidal-next-music-streaming-service-drown\">Jay-Z has founded Tidal</a>. Other rivals include France-based Deezer and US-based Rhapsody, which also operates as Napster.</p> <p>Spotify launched Discover Weekly, which generates a personalised playlist of songs, started offering video and podcast features in January and <a href=\"https://news.starbucks.com/news/new-era-of-music-debuts-at-starbucks-with-spotify\">teamed up with Starbucks in the US</a> to bring in new subscribers. After pausing its international expansion last year, the firm added Indonesia as its 59th country this year.</p> <p>The financial results were filed by its Luxembourg-based holding company Spotify Technologies. It said: \u201cWe believe our model supports profitability at scale. We believe that we will generate substantial revenues as our reach expands and that, at scale, our margins will improve. We will therefore continue to invest relentlessly in our product and marketing initiatives to accelerate reach.\u201d</p> <p>A recent industry report showed that global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/12/streaming-revenues-bring-big-boost-to-global-music-industry\">digital music revenues overtook the takings from CDs and vinyl records</a> for the first time last year. </p> <p>However, Spotify has yet to convince its critics that it can make money. The firm, the biggest service of its kind, has been the target of much of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/07/spotify-thom-yorke-dying-corpse\">criticism directed at music streaming by Radiohead</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/19/adele-new-album-25-not-stream-spotify-apple-music\">Adele</a> and others, with Taylor Swift pulling her entire back catalogue from Spotify in 2014. </p> <p>Undaunted, Spotify, which is controlled by its founders, Ek and fellow Swede Martin Lorentzon, plans a stock market flotation in the next few years. It raised \u20ac890m in its most recent funding round from private equity group TPG, Goldman Sachs and hedge fund Dragoneer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/28/deezer-ipo-music-streaming\">French rival Deezer pulled plans for a float last autumn</a>, blaming difficult market conditions.<br></p>",

Halfords is paying \u00a318.4m for the Swansea-based online retailer which specialises in premium bikes and accessories, with the figure topped up in a year\u2019s time if the business performs as expected. Other equity-owning management will receive some of the cash. The Halfords chief executive, Jill McDonald, said the deal would expand the retailer\u2019s presence in the online market for premium bikes, parts, accessories and clothing. \u201cWe continue to believe in the long-term growth potential of the cycling market,\u201d she said. \u201cKeith and his management team have done a fantastic job of building a successful online retail operation and we look forward to working with them to develop and grow the businesses further.\u201d The deal sent Halfords shares up 3%, adding to gains made this year as they continue to recover from the slump triggered by last summer\u2019s sharp drop in cycling-related sales. The Jones brothers started Wheelies as a single bicycle shop in Swansea in the 1980s, moving into mail order and the insurance replacement market during the 1990s. Wheelies is now the UK\u2019s largest provider of replacement bikes for insurance companies. Tredz, which sells brands such as Giant, Specialized, Cannondale, Cube and Scott, was launched as a separate e-commerce operation in 2005, with the first stores launched in Cardiff and Swansea two years later. Tredz opened the UK\u2019s largest Giant branded store in Swansea in 2014. The group turned over around \u00a332m in the year to 29 February, making a profit before financial charges of \u00a32.4m. \u201cWe are very proud of the businesses that we\u2019ve grown from a small shop 27 years ago into a strong operator in the premium cycling market, with a team of over 250 people,\u201d said Keith Jones. \u201cWith the support and resources of a large group, we look forward to building upon what we have achieved so far to drive long- term growth.\u201d Following the sale Michael is leaving the business while Keith will continue as managing director alongside other members of the existing Tredz and Wheelies teams. Halfords said that from a customer and supplier perspective the businesses would continue to trade on a standalone basis. Cannaccord Genuity analyst David Jeary said the acquisition \u201cticks the boxes\u201d for Halfords as it was in the faster-growing online market and brought access to high-end brands. In the past some premium cycling brands have turned their noses up at Halfords, preferring to be sold though specialist independents. Jeary said this could now change: \u201cThere is the potential over time for Halfords to develop closer relationships with some of these brands which have historically not made themselves available.\u201d",

In heated exchanges at a parliamentary select committee on Tuesday, Carney told MPs the BoE had a responsibility to the British people \u201cwho don\u2019t want risks kept from them\u201d. The governor rebutted criticism from pro-Brexit Tory MPs Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker that the bank was wrong to pass judgment on the economic impact of leaving the EU. Rees-Mogg, who has previously called for Carney to resign over his Brexit warnings, renewed his attacks, calling the BoE a \u201ccreature of the government\u201d. He said he was concerned that the Bank has succumbed to pressure from the chancellor to highlight the risks of a Brexit and downplay the potential benefits of a vote to leave, while Baker accused it of producing flawed economic forecasts. Rees-Mogg accused Carney of becoming \u201cpolitically involved\u201d. He responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s worth replying to.\u201d At a previous Treasury select committee hearing in March, Rees-Mogg accused Carney of jeopardising the bank\u2019s reputation for \u201cOlympian detachment\u201d by emphasising the pros but not the cons of EU membership. This time the MP for North East Somerset and Brexit campaigner said the Bank of England was not in the habit of commenting on opposition economic policy during a general election campaign, so should not comment on the effects of a UK departure from the EU during the referendum campaign. Carney rejected the analogy, saying: \u201cWe have a responsibility to discharge our remit and we have a wider responsibility to the British people, who don\u2019t want risks kept from them. \u201cTo suggest otherwise is to try to undermine that.\u201d He said a general election involved many political parties and could result in coalition governments. He added that a referendum presented a single clear issue whereas manifesto pledges covered many topics and could take years to implement. Earlier this month, the Bank of England gave a stark warning that a vote to leave the EU could push the economy into recession. The report said the economy had already begun to suffer the effects of the uncertainty surrounding the referendum outcome, pushing down the value of sterling and discouraging commercial property investment in the UK. At Tuesday\u2019s select committee hearing the deputy bank governor, Ben Broadbent, and external committee members Martin Weale and Dr Gertjan Vlieghe , said they had acted independently and without influence from the Treasury or Carney to warn that Brexit uncertainty was having a negative impact on the economy. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the committee quizzing Carney and other BoE officials, said MPs would have criticised the governor if he had avoided making an assessment of the risks of Brexit.",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, George Osborne, has fallen behind in his deficit-reduction programme just a month into the new financial year, with the government borrowing more than expected in April. The UK government had to borrow \u00a37.2bn last month to plug the gap between spending and earnings, according to the Office for National Statistics. It was \u00a3300m less than April 2015, but higher than the \u00a36.6bn that economists expected. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said the figures marked \u201ca disappointing start\u201d to the 2016-17 financial year. He added: \u201cWhile it was still an improvement, it wasn\u2019t big enough to keep the public finances on track. \u201cTo hit the chancellor\u2019s borrowing goal for this year we needed to see borrowing down by an average of \u00a31.5bn per month compared with the same month a year ago so we are running behind schedule already.\u201d In a further blow to George Osborne, the March borrowing figures were revised up by about \u00a32bn, taking the total for 2015-16 to \u00a376bn \u2013 almost \u00a34bn more than official forecasters at the Office for Budget Responsibility expected. Osborne\u2019s borrowing target for this year is \u00a355.5bn, according to the OBR forecasts at the time of the budget in March. The Treasury said the figures showed an improvement in the public finances, with borrowing down on the same month a year ago and the lowest April monthly deficit since the recession. However, the spokeswoman warned that a vote to leave the European Union on 23 June would worsen the public finances, as tax receipts would fall during a fresh recession. \u201cThe fiscal repair job is not finished and it would be dangerous to put this at risk,\u201d she said. \u201cAs uncertainty ahead of the referendum weighs on our outlook, Treasury analysis has shown that if the UK votes to leave the EU on 23 June, we would be tipped into a year-long recession and receipts could fall by \u00a336bn in the long term, unwinding years of hard work.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Seven Trent has made a promising start to the new Ofwat regulatory regime, the water company said as it reported better than expected results. Full year profits rose 4.4% to \u00a3313.6m, and it confirmed an expected 5% cut in the dividend. It said it expected to save \u00a3670m in total expenditure over the five years to 2020 as it made further efficiency savings. This is about \u00a3260m better than the target set by the regulator, and it is also benefiting from lower borrowing costs in the current interest rate environment. The company claims to have the lowest water and sewage bills in Britain, while customer complaints were down 28% year on year. Steve Clayton, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The group is benefiting from lower funding costs, with the average effective interest rate on the group\u2019s debts dropping nearly 1% to 4.5%. The drive to push costs down has allowed the company to continue to charge the lowest combined water and sewerage bills in Britain. On average, bills are less than a pound a day. Angelos Anastasiou, utilities analyst at Whitman Howard, said: Severn Trent\u2019s results announcement states that \u201cgroup financial results [are] in line with expectations\u201d, but full year adjusted pre-tax profit and earnings per share are ahead of both our and the market\u2019s expectations. The 5.0% cut in the 2015/16 dividend on the other hand, is exactly as had been previously indicated. The other area that is ahead of expectations is the net reward in Ofwat\u2019s Outcome Delivery Incentives (ODIs) which at \u00a323.2m for 20 15/16 is greater than the \u00a315m indicated in the February trading update (which itself had been increased from \u00a310m at the interims). So overall, this first set of full year results is good...but with just 3% total return upside we maintain our hold recommendation, and still see Severn Trent as the most expensive of the three waters currently. Even so, Severn Trent\u2019s shares are currently 48p higher at \u00a322.61. Among the mid-caps there has been a more mixed response to a couple of updates, with insurance group Homeserve 21p higher at 452.3p but software group Aveva down 95p or nearly 6% to \u00a315.05. Aveva, which called off a merger with France\u2019s Schneider Electric in December, unveiled an 18% decline in full year profits to \u00a351.2m.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Seven Trent</strong> has made a promising start to the new Ofwat regulatory regime, the water company said as it reported better than expected results.</p> <p>Full year profits rose 4.4% to \u00a3313.6m, and it confirmed an expected 5% cut in the dividend. It said it expected to save \u00a3670m in total expenditure over the five years to 2020 as it made further efficiency savings. This is about \u00a3260m better than the target set by the regulator, and it is also benefiting from lower borrowing costs in the current interest rate environment.</p> <p>The company claims to have the lowest water and sewage bills in Britain, while customer complaints were down 28% year on year. Steve Clayton, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The group is benefiting from lower funding costs, with the average effective interest rate on the group\u2019s debts dropping nearly 1% to 4.5%. The drive to push costs down has allowed the company to continue to charge the lowest combined water and sewerage bills in Britain. On average, bills are less than a pound a day.</p> </blockquote> <p>Angelos Anastasiou,<strong> u</strong>tilities analyst at Whitman Howard, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Severn Trent\u2019s results announcement states that \u201cgroup financial results [are] in line with expectations\u201d, but full year adjusted pre-tax profit and earnings per share are ahead of both our and the market\u2019s expectations. The 5.0% cut in the 2015/16 dividend on the other hand, is exactly as had been previously indicated.</p> <p>The other area that is ahead of expectations is the net reward in Ofwat\u2019s Outcome Delivery Incentives (ODIs) which at \u00a323.2m for 20 15/16 is greater than the \u00a315m indicated in the February trading update (which itself had been increased from \u00a310m at the interims).</p> <p>So overall, this first set of full year results is good...but with just 3% total return upside we maintain our hold recommendation, and still see Severn Trent as the most expensive of the three waters currently.</p> </blockquote> <p> Even so, Severn Trent\u2019s shares are currently 48p higher at \u00a322.61.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps there has been a more mixed response to a couple of updates, with insurance group <strong>Homeserve</strong> 21p higher at 452.3p but software group <strong>Aveva </strong>down 95p or nearly 6% to \u00a315.05. Aveva, which called off a merger with France\u2019s Schneider Electric in December, unveiled an 18% decline in full year profits to \u00a351.2m.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares have shrugged off the prospect of an imminent US rate rise which has been a dampening factor in recent days. After an early dip, the FTSE 100 is now up 29.24 points at 6165.67 although investors are still cautious as the Eurogroup meets to decide whether to release the latest tranche of bailout funds. Among the risers, Kingfisher has pleased the market after a positive first quarter update from Europe\u2019s largest home improvement retailer, rising 6.7p to 367.2p. Despite signs that consumers are shying away from DIY, the group is benefiting from strong business from trade customers. It said a strong performance from Screwfix helped like for like sales in the UK and Ireland rise by 6.2%, but in France sales were up just 0.2%. Poland did well, rising 10.8% after a boost from new ranges. Overall sales rose 3.6% to \u00a32.7bn. Chief executive Veronique Laury said the company was making progress with its five year strategic plan unveiled in January. She said: We have made a solid start to the year, trading in line with expectations. In addition, I am pleased with the early progress we are making on our operational milestones for this year, the first year of our ambitious five year plan. But it has yet to see the effects of the purchase of rival Homebase by Wesfarmers. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The home improvement market is growing and buoyant sales at Screwfix reflect an increasing trend to call a man in rather than DIY. We are seeing the same in France with the consumer-facing business Castorama going backwards while trade-focused Brico Depot, put in a decent performance. Against the back drop of store closures, like for like sales at B&amp;Q grew at a decent pace. Seasonal sales were down for the second year running, but this is just the ongoing return to \u201cnormal\u201d levels of activity after a 30% surge in the first quarter of 2014/15. The group is just a few months into the five year One Kingfisher efficiency programme, with benefits promised for the years ahead. It\u2019s too early to see the competitive impact of the sale of Homebase to Wesfarmers earlier this year, but this is set to be an increasing challenge. Kingfisher are nicely placed to benefit from a recovery in France and wider Europe, if and when it happens. Freddie George at Cantor Fitzgerald said: The significant change to the operational board over the last three years is, we believe, leading to a major shift in the company\u2019s culture and strategy. There is also a growing acceptance that after a number of \u2018false dawns\u2019, the ranges and the assortments of the international businesses have to be more properly integrated and the diversity of its cross border formats reduced. We are raising our target price to 360p from 320p and would look to buy the stock on weakness. Our only concern in the short term is the current rating. Since the beginning of September 2014, the stock has steadily outperformed the FT All Share by over 20% over this time. It is rated at 16.0 times 2017 our revised earnings forecasts. The positive update has also lifted Wickes-owner Travis Perkins, up 31p at \u00a319.17. Among the other risers, Imperial Brands has added 70p to \u00a337.30 despite Monday\u2019s news that Axa was pulling out of tobacco investments. It was lifted by analysts at Barclays moving from equal weight to overweight and raising their target price from \u00a337.50 to \u00a342. The bank said: Imperial is executing strongly. Organic sales momentum is improving and margin/cash generation increases underpin 10% plus dividend growth. Moreover, we are increasingly confident margins will surprise to the upside and that the US is performing ahead of expectations. But Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling is down 44p at \u00a313.21 following the proposed sale of a 1.5% stake by shareholder New Argen Holdings.",
