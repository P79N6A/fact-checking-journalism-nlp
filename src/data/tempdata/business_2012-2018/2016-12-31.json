Engineers in Dubai worked on the A380 aircraft while passengers were put up in hotels while they waited to learn when they could fly to Australia. Other flights at Dubai international airport, the world\u2019s busiest for international travel, were delayed by fog. The UAE\u2019s National Center of Meteorology &amp; Seismology issued a fog warning on Saturday morning, saying visibility had dropped below 100 metres in most areas. High humidity and falling temperatures cause the fog to roll in seasonally along the coast of the Arabian Peninsula.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On the day the BHS store in Edinburgh closed down, Lin Macmillan, a former employee, decided to visit it one last time. \u201cIt was really sad,\u201d she said. \u201cThe staff were obviously very upset but still acted professionally.\u201d Macmillan worked for BHS for a decade and is one of more than 20,000 pensioners who face a cut to their income after the collapse of the company. \u201cI first realised something was wrong in March when I got a leaflet from the pension trustees about what would happen if the company went into administration. I was like, hmm \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t do that if there wasn\u2019t a problem.\u201d A month later, BHS did indeed collapse into administration. This led to the closure of all 164 shops, the loss of 11,000 jobs, and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit. \u201cI was angry and sad,\u201d Macmillan added. \u201cIt was avoidable if Green and his family hadn\u2019t milked the company in the way they did. Chappell was way out of his depth. He took something on that he didn\u2019t understand. The Green family are entirely to blame. They must have been delighted to find an idiot to sell it to.\u201d Green and Chappell \u2013 Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell \u2013 became two of the most vilified people in Britain after the demise of BHS. At a time when Britain was divided about its future in the European Union, it was united in anger at Green, the billionaire tycoon, and Chappell, the three-time bankrupt. According to a parliamentary report into the failure of BHS, Green and Chappell had systematically plundered the retailer before it shut. Green controlled BHS for 15 years until he sold it to Chappell\u2019s company, Retail Acquisitions, for \u00a31 in March 2015. During this period, the tycoon, his family and other shareholders collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments on debt. Retail Acquisitions, meanwhile, was paid at least \u00a317m \u2013 despite having owned the chain for only 13 months before its demise. In June 2016, Green pledged before MPs that he would \u201csort\u201d the problems facing the BHS pension scheme. However, as 2016 drew to a close, a rescue deal had failed to appear. The repercussions of BHS\u2019s failure \u2013 one of the biggest corporate scandals to hit Britain in the 21st century \u2013 will continue to be felt through 2017. Although the parliamentary committee led by Labour MPs Iain Wright and Frank Field has delivered its verdict, there are other investigations still underway. The Pensions Regulator, the Insolvency Service, the Financial Reporting Council, HM Revenue &amp; Customs and the Serious Fraud Office are all still looking into the circumstances surrounding the collapse of the 88-year-old chain. Macmillan hopes the Pensions Regulator, led by Lesley Titcomb, can force the Green family to pay money into the BHS pension scheme. \u201cI hope she uses the power she has to force them to pay up,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will still be fabulously wealthy anyway.\u201d The Pensions Regulator has started legal proceedings against Green and Chappell in an attempt to force them to fill the BHS pension deficit. It is understood to be seeking \u00a3350m from Green and as much as \u00a317m from Retail Acquisitions, which is 90% owned by Chappell. At the same time, the Insolvency Service is investigating the conduct of the former directors, the Financial Reporting Council is examining the audit of BHS\u2019s 2014 accounts by PricewaterhouseCoopers, and the SFO is looking into possible grounds to launch a formal criminal investigation into the closure of the retailer. Green\u2019s knighthood also remains on the line after MPs voted in favour of stripping it from him. This will ultimately be decided by honours forfeiture committee, which will make a recommendation to the prime minister and the Queen. A spokesperson for Green said he had nothing further to say on the collapse of BHS or his discussions with the Pensions Regulator. However, Chappell was unrepentant when contacted by the Observer, and insisted the blame for the BHS collapse lay with Green and the retail managers who ran the store chain from day to day. \u201cThere are three reasons why it collapsed,\u201d he said. \u201cPhilip undertook to deal with the trade credit insurers [who ensure that retailers do not have to pay suppliers upfront for goods] and he did not do that. We needed another \u00a330m that we had not budgeted for because we couldn\u2019t deal with the trade credit insurers. He also undertook to deal with his moral hazard on the pension scheme, which he did not do. This screwed our finances. The third thing that crippled us was the very bad trading that the company did last Christmas, led by Darren Topp [the former chief executive]. \u201cWe have been criticised heavily for having no retail experience. We backed the management of BHS, we funded them, and we produced funds of around \u00a380m for them to do their turnaround.\u201d Chappell, who says his life since the collapse of the company has been \u201cextremely difficult\u201d, also defended the millions Retail Acquisitions took out of the BHS. \u201cWe\u2019re not a charity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t ever going to do this for nothing. We had significant costs pre-acquisition. We complied with every single thing that we needed to do as directors, and at no stage did we trade immorally. We did everything we possibly could to try to resolve the BHS issue and we were let down on three matters.\u201d However, others involved with the matter have significantly different views on the conduct of Chappell and Retail Acquisitions. Evidence submitted to the parliamentary investigation into the collapse of the company describes the chaos in the final days of the high street chain. Topp and Michael Hitchcock, the two most senior retail executives at BHS in the run-up to its failure, have been severely critical of Chappell. They, and Green, dispute his version of events. \u201cLike many others throughout this process, I think I was duped,\u201d Hitchcock, a former financial consultant, told MPs about his interactions with Chappell. \u201cI think the technical term is a mythomaniac. The layperson\u2019s term is that he was a premier league liar and a Sunday pub league retailer, at best.\u201d Topp added: \u201cTo be honest, I took it at face value that it was true [that Chappell could help turn BHS around]. Unfortunately, as time progressed, that unravelled in terms of that promise, and it became clear towards the end that rather than putting money in, he had his fingers in the till.\u201d The key to BHS\u2019s survival was persuading landlords to reduce their rent bills, which Topp believed would be possible once BHS was free from Green\u2019s empire. This turned out to be true: in March 2016, landlords voted in favour of dramatically cutting the rent on 87 of BHS\u2019s 164 shops. Unfortunately, by that point the company\u2019s finances were unravelling and key suppliers, credit insurers and other stakeholders had lost faith in Chappell, warning Topp that BHS needed new owners in order to be successful. Topp\u2019s faith in Chappell had started to unravel the previous June, when documents submitted to the Pensions Regulator revealed financial transactions that made him uncomfortable. As part of its investigation into the company, the regulator had served BHS with a \u201csection 72 notice\u201d, requiring it to disclose financial documents. These documents showed that the \u00a310m that Retail Acquisitions had put into BHS had been borrowed, that it had taken a \u00a37m cut from the sale of BHS\u2019s head office, North West House on London\u2019s Marylebone Road, and that Chappell and his personal company, Swiss Rock, had been paid \u00a31.8m after buying the department store chain. Topp said he felt \u201cexposed\u201d, so had brought in Hitchcock to be his finance man. Hitchcock quickly became concerned about Retail Acquisitions, eventually changing BHS\u2019s rules so that two directors had to sign off every expense. The movement of money out of BHS became public just weeks before landlords voted on whether to cut the company\u2019s rent, when the Guardian revealed the existence of an \u00a38.4m loan between BHS and Retail Acquisitions, of which roughly a third had gone to its directors, including Chappell. The anger was palpable among landlords who were being asked to take a financial hit and BHS staff who were losing their jobs. Topp says he approached Green around this time over his concerns about Chappell and what they could do. Green\u2019s retail business, Arcadia, still ran back-office functions for BHS such as payroll, sold products in its shops, and was owed \u00a340m by the company \u2013 making it a key creditor and partner. Green had remained in contact with Topp and Chappell since selling BHS. However, it was too late. Even though landlords agreed to reduce their rental payments, BHS needed to raise another \u00a3100m in order to survive. Chappell and his team could not raise enough from selling property and a new loan he proposed came with onerous and expensive terms, meaning it was rejected by the rest of the management team. On Monday 25 April, BHS went into administration. Officially \u2013 and controversially \u2013 it was Green who pulled the plug and brought in Duff &amp; Phelps as administrator, which he had the power to do because of the \u00a340m debt BHS owed to Arcadia. By this point, the relationship between the main parties had disintegrated. Topp did not trust Chappell, Chappell thought Topp was plotting behind his back with Green, and Green was hurtling into the biggest crisis of his career. Chappell tried to reach a last-minute rescue deal with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct, but failed. Green claims that he was advised by Duff &amp; Phelps to issue the demand that pushed BHS into administration in order to protect the salaries of its staff in the event a rescue package could not be secured. Green read a letter from Duff &amp; Phelps to MPs that claimed HMRC had issued a seven-day winding-up notice against BHS, that lawyers acting for the board of BHS had advised the directors they were at risk of wrongful trading, and that the salaries of staff might not be paid unless the retailer was protected by an administration order. However, Chappell insists Green could have saved BHS and blames him for the company going into administration. Amid those chaotic last days of BHS and the fraught meetings, Chappell moved \u00a31.5m out of the retailer into an unconnected entity called BHS Sweden. Topp said he initially thought this was theft and confronted Chappell, who allegedly threatened to kill him. Chappell said the money was for professional fees, but eventually paid it back. After the collapse of the company the Guardian revealed other transactions that had caused concern for BHS management. These included Chappell using \u00a31.5m of BHS money to pay off the mortgage on his family home just as it was about to be repossessed; the sale of BHS\u2019s warehouse to a friend of Chappell\u2019s (with Retail Acquisitions taking a third of the proceeds); and a series of complex loans and property deals between Chappell, BHS and property company Allied Commercial Exporters, which made millions of pounds from the transactions. In the week that BHS fell into administration, Chappell was in the Bahamas. An abusive note was pinned on the wall in one of the lifts at BHS\u2019s head office criticising Retail Acquisitions and the money they collected from the retailer. Chappell, meanwhile, sent a text message to Topp when it was confirmed that all BHS shops were to close. \u201cWell done,\u201d it read. \u201cI hope you and Michael are happy that you got the out come [sic] you wanted. You fucking prick.\u201d Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrator to BHS, has, according to sources, filed a damning report on the conduct of Chappell and Retail Acquisitions. FRP Advisory, the liquidator, is understood to be conducting further investigations into some of the transactions under Retail Acquisitions. Green, meanwhile, claims he was misled by Chappell and blames him for the furore of the past year. Retail analysts say the lack of investment in BHS under Green and the mismanagement under Chappell pushed over the edge a business that would have been struggling anyway in the present retail market, where sales are moving from the high street to online, and department stores are under pressure. \u201cIt was a relic. It was a model that had passed its sell-by date many years ago,\u201d Richard Hyman, an independent retail consultant, said. \u201cIt had been overtaken by discount stores such as Primark, but it was also underinvested. The mismanagement was in fact the final of a number of straws.\u201d For the staff of BHS, however, the downfall of the business was about much more than its place on the high street: it was their livelihood. Grant Atterbury, a worker who wrote a diary for the Guardian during the last weeks of BHS, said: \u201cThere was no tearful farewell to the old building [in Tunbridge Wells] as we exited the front doors for the last time, because, having sat in the stifling heat doing nothing for the previous three hours, we were all desperate to stretch our legs and feel some fresh air on our faces. No one even looked back, as far as I recall.\u201d Last week \u2013 as Green and his family were reported to be spending the holidays in a Miami celebrity enclave \u2013 Atterbury wrote an update on his life post-BHS, outlining his struggle to pay the rent and how he had been forced to take a loan from his mother to cover his food bills until his benefit claim is processed. Hundreds of other former BHS workers have had to apply for grants from the Fashion and Textile Children\u2019s Trust \u2013 a 163-year-old charity once chaired by Charles Dickens \u2013 for hardship payments. Atterbury wrote: \u201cThe fact that throughout the country countless other ex-BHS employees are facing similar situations and worse fills me with anger and sadness.\u201d Where are they now? Sir Philip Green After appearing in front of MPs and pledging to \u201csort\u201d the BHS pension scheme, Green spent the summer on his new \u00a3100m yacht, Lionheart, in the Mediterranean. His only public appearance since has been an interview with ITV\u2019s Robert Peston, when he said he was \u201csad and very sorry\u201d for the collapse of the company and that it has been a \u201chorrible\u201d time for him and his family. The Pensions Regulator has started legal proceedings against Green and a decision whether to strip him of his knighthood will be made when official investigations have been completed. Dominic Chappell Spent much of his time since BHS collapsed juggling requests for information and interviews by regulatory bodies. He was banned from driving for six months in August. Chappell claims Retail Acquisitions is looking to do new deals, but the liquidators want to wind the company up and it faces a court hearing in January that will determine whether it survives. Darren Topp Left BHS after its shops closed in August, but is already back in retail. Topp was appointed in September as chief executive of luxury fashion and footwear chain LK Bennett. Michael Hitchcock has joined him as chief financial officer. Paul Sutton Chappell was working as Sutton\u2019s driver when Green pulled out of a deal to sell BHS to Sutton. This paved the way for Chappell to become involved. Green scrapped the deal because a whistleblower delivered him a dossier revealing that Sutton had been convicted of fraud in France in 2002. Sutton and Chappell have since fallen out, with Sutton claiming that he could have saved BHS, while Chappell bled it dry. Sutton is now looking to revive his business career and move back to Monaco.",

However, as 2016 drew to a close, a rescue deal had failed to appear.</p> <p>The repercussions of BHS\u2019s failure \u2013 one of the biggest corporate scandals to hit Britain in the 21st century \u2013 will continue to be felt through 2017. Although the parliamentary committee led by Labour MPs Iain Wright and Frank Field has delivered its verdict, there are other investigations still underway. The Pensions Regulator, the Insolvency Service, the Financial Reporting Council, HM Revenue &amp; Customs and the Serious Fraud Office are all still looking into the circumstances surrounding the collapse of the 88-year-old chain.</p> <p>Macmillan hopes the Pensions Regulator, led by Lesley Titcomb, can force the Green family to pay money into the BHS pension scheme. \u201cI hope she uses the power she has to force them to pay up,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will still be fabulously wealthy anyway.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/philip-green-may-be-forced-to-pay-money-into-bhs-pension-scheme\" title=\"\">The Pensions Regulator has started legal proceedings against Green and Chappell in an attempt to force them to fill the BHS pension deficit</a>. It is understood to be seeking \u00a3350m from Green and as much as \u00a317m from Retail Acquisitions, which is 90% owned by Chappell. At the same time, the Insolvency Service is investigating the conduct of the former directors, the Financial Reporting Council is examining the audit of BHS\u2019s 2014 accounts by PricewaterhouseCoopers, and the SFO is looking into possible grounds to launch a formal criminal investigation into the closure of the retailer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bc96ebf36018f1fe992e8e48dc6f9f6a5a5d35f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bc96ebf36018f1fe992e8e48dc6f9f6a5a5d35f/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Green tells Sky News to go away in Greece after questions over BHS closure\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Green tells Sky News to go away in Greece after questions over BHS closure</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Green\u2019s knighthood also remains on the line after MPs voted in favour of stripping it from him. This will ultimately be decided by honours forfeiture committee, which will make a recommendation to the prime minister and the Queen.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Green said he had nothing further to say on the collapse of BHS or his discussions with the Pensions Regulator. However, Chappell was unrepentant when contacted by the <em>Observer</em>, and insisted the blame for the BHS collapse lay with Green and the retail managers who ran the store chain from day to day.</p> <p>\u201cThere are three reasons why it collapsed,\u201d he said. \u201cPhilip undertook to deal with the trade credit insurers [who ensure that retailers do not have to pay suppliers upfront for goods] and he did not do that. We needed another \u00a330m that we had not budgeted for because we couldn\u2019t deal with the trade credit insurers. He also undertook to deal with his moral hazard on the pension scheme, which he did not do. This screwed our finances. The third thing that crippled us was the very bad trading that the company did last Christmas, led by Darren Topp [the former chief executive].</p> <p>\u201cWe have been criticised heavily for having no retail experience. We backed the management of BHS, we funded them, and we produced funds of around \u00a380m for them to do their turnaround.\u201d</p> <p>Chappell, who says his life since the collapse of the company has been \u201cextremely difficult\u201d, also defended the millions Retail Acquisitions took out of the BHS.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not a charity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t ever going to do this for nothing. We had significant costs pre-acquisition. We complied with every single thing that we needed to do as directors, and at no stage did we trade immorally. We did everything we possibly could to try to resolve the BHS issue and we were let down on three matters.\u201d</p> <p>However, others involved with the matter have significantly different views on the conduct of Chappell and Retail Acquisitions. Evidence submitted to the parliamentary investigation into the collapse of the company describes the chaos in the final days of the high street chain.</p> <p>Topp and Michael Hitchcock, the two most senior retail executives at BHS in the run-up to its failure, have been severely critical of Chappell. They, and Green, dispute his version of events.</p> <p>\u201cLike many others throughout this process, I think I was duped,\u201d Hitchcock, a former financial consultant, told MPs about his interactions with Chappell. \u201cI think the technical term is a mythomaniac. The layperson\u2019s term is that he was a premier league liar and a Sunday pub league retailer, at best.\u201d</p> <p>Topp added: \u201cTo be honest, I took it at face value that it was true [that Chappell could help turn BHS around]. Unfortunately, as time progressed, that unravelled in terms of that promise, and it became clear towards the end that rather than putting money in, he had his fingers in the till.\u201d</p> <p>The key to BHS\u2019s survival was persuading landlords to reduce their rent bills, which Topp believed would be possible once BHS was free from Green\u2019s empire. This turned out to be true: in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/23/bhs-creditors-approve-rescue-plan-company-voluntary-arrangement\" title=\"\">March 2016, landlords voted in favour of dramatically cutting the rent on 87 of BHS\u2019s 164 shops.</a></p> <p>Unfortunately, by that point the company\u2019s finances were unravelling and key suppliers, credit insurers and other stakeholders had lost faith in Chappell, warning Topp that BHS needed new owners in order to be successful.</p> <p>Topp\u2019s faith in Chappell had started to unravel the previous June, when documents submitted to the Pensions Regulator revealed financial transactions that made him uncomfortable. As part of its investigation into the company, the regulator had served BHS with a \u201csection 72 notice\u201d, requiring it to disclose financial documents. These documents showed that the \u00a310m that Retail Acquisitions had put into BHS had been borrowed, that it had taken a \u00a37m cut from the sale of BHS\u2019s head office, North West House on London\u2019s Marylebone Road, and that Chappell and his personal company, Swiss Rock, had been paid \u00a31.8m after buying the department store chain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5cbaad6c7ac9273b9e683e80101187e166313e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5cbaad6c7ac9273b9e683e80101187e166313e0/0_322_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The BHS headquarters on Marylebone Road was sold in March 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The BHS headquarters on Marylebone Road was sold in March 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Topp said he felt \u201cexposed\u201d, so had brought in Hitchcock to be his finance man. Hitchcock quickly became concerned about Retail Acquisitions, eventually changing BHS\u2019s rules so that two directors had to sign off every expense.</p> <p>The movement of money out of BHS became public just weeks before landlords voted on whether to cut the company\u2019s rent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/04/owners-84-million-pound-loan-from-bhs-staff-job-losses\" title=\"\">when the <em>Guardian</em> revealed the existence of an \u00a38.4m loan between BHS and Retail Acquisitions</a>, of which roughly a third had gone to its directors, including Chappell. The anger was palpable among landlords who were being asked to take a financial hit and BHS staff who were losing their jobs.</p> <p>Topp says he approached Green around this time over his concerns about Chappell and what they could do. Green\u2019s retail business, Arcadia, still ran back-office functions for BHS such as payroll, sold products in its shops, and was owed \u00a340m by the company \u2013 making it a key creditor and partner. Green had remained in contact with Topp and Chappell since selling BHS.</p> <p>However, it was too late. Even though landlords agreed to reduce their rental payments, BHS needed to raise another \u00a3100m in order to survive. Chappell and his team could not raise enough from selling property and a new loan he proposed came with onerous and expensive terms, meaning it was rejected by the rest of the management team.</p> <p>On Monday 25 April, BHS went into administration. Officially \u2013 and controversially \u2013 it was Green who pulled the plug and brought in Duff &amp; Phelps as administrator, which he had the power to do because of the \u00a340m debt BHS owed to Arcadia.</p> <p>By this point, the relationship between the main parties had disintegrated. Topp did not trust Chappell, Chappell thought Topp was plotting behind his back with Green, and Green was hurtling into the biggest crisis of his career. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/24/bhs-on-the-brink-of-collapse-unless-60m-pounds-funding-found\" title=\"\">Chappell tried to reach a last-minute rescue deal with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct, but failed.</a></p> <p>Green claims that he was advised by Duff &amp; Phelps to issue the demand that pushed BHS into administration in order to protect the salaries of its staff in the event a rescue package could not be secured. Green read a letter from Duff &amp; Phelps to MPs that claimed HMRC had issued a seven-day winding-up notice against BHS, that lawyers acting for the board of BHS had advised the directors they were at risk of wrongful trading, and that the salaries of staff might not be paid unless the retailer was protected by an administration order. However, Chappell insists Green could have saved BHS and blames him for the company going into administration.</p> <p>Amid those chaotic last days of BHS and the fraught meetings, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/26/bhs-owner-dominic-chappell-moved-funds-out-of-troubled-retailer\" title=\"\">Chappell moved \u00a31.5m out of the retailer into an unconnected entity called BHS Sweden</a>. Topp said he initially thought this was theft and confronted Chappell, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/bhs-owner-boss-says-dominic-chappell-had-his-fingers-in-the-till\" title=\"\">allegedly threatened to kill him</a>. Chappell said the money was for professional fees, but eventually paid it back.</p> <p>After the collapse of the company the <em>Guardian</em> revealed other transactions that had caused concern for BHS management. These included Chappell using \u00a31.5m of BHS money to pay off the mortgage on his family home just as it was about to be repossessed; the sale of BHS\u2019s warehouse to a friend of Chappell\u2019s (with Retail Acquisitions taking a third of the proceeds); and a series of complex loans and property deals between Chappell, BHS and property company Allied Commercial Exporters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/29/bhs-property-investors-profited-backing-dominic-chappell\" title=\"\">which made millions of pounds from the transactions</a>.</p> <p>In the week that BHS fell into administration, Chappell was in the Bahamas. An abusive note was pinned on the wall in one of the lifts at BHS\u2019s head office criticising Retail Acquisitions and the money they collected from the retailer. Chappell, meanwhile, sent a text message to Topp when it was confirmed that all BHS shops were to close. \u201cWell done,\u201d it read. \u201cI hope you and Michael are happy that you got the out come [sic] you wanted. You fucking prick.\u201d</p> <p>Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrator to BHS, has, according to sources, filed a damning report on the conduct of Chappell and Retail Acquisitions. FRP Advisory, the liquidator, is understood to be conducting further investigations into some of the transactions under Retail Acquisitions. Green, meanwhile, claims he was misled by Chappell and blames him for the furore of the past year.</p> <p>Retail analysts say the lack of investment in BHS under Green and the mismanagement under Chappell pushed over the edge a business that would have been struggling anyway in the present retail market, where sales are moving from the high street to online, and department stores are under pressure.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a relic. It was a model that had passed its sell-by date many years ago,\u201d Richard Hyman, an independent retail consultant, said. \u201cIt had been overtaken by discount stores such as Primark, but it was also underinvested. The mismanagement was in fact the final of a number of straws.\u201d</p> <p>For the staff of BHS, however, the downfall of the business was about much more than its place on the high street: it was their livelihood.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/grant-atterbury\" title=\"\">Grant Atterbury</a>, a worker who wrote a diary for the <em>Guardian</em> during the last weeks of BHS, said: \u201cThere was no tearful farewell to the old building [in Tunbridge Wells] as we exited the front doors for the last time, because, having sat in the stifling heat doing nothing for the previous three hours, we were all desperate to stretch our legs and feel some fresh air on our faces. No one even looked back, as far as I recall.\u201d</p> <p>Last week \u2013 as Green and his family were reported to be spending the holidays in a Miami celebrity enclave \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/28/debt-christmas-bhs-workers-philip-green\" title=\"\">Atterbury wrote an update on his life post-BHS</a>, outlining his struggle to pay the rent and how he had been forced to take a loan from his mother to cover his food bills until his benefit claim is processed. Hundreds of other former BHS workers have had to apply for grants from the Fashion and Textile Children\u2019s Trust \u2013 a 163-year-old charity once chaired by Charles Dickens \u2013 for hardship payments. Atterbury wrote: \u201cThe fact that throughout the country countless other ex-BHS employees are facing similar situations and worse fills me with anger and sadness.\u201d</p> <h2>Where are they now?</h2> <p><strong>Sir Philip Green </strong>After appearing in front of MPs and pledging to \u201csort\u201d the BHS pension scheme, Green spent the summer on his new \u00a3100m yacht, Lionheart, in the Mediterranean. His only public appearance since has been an interview with ITV\u2019s Robert Peston, when he said he was \u201csad and very sorry\u201d for the collapse of the company and that it has been a \u201chorrible\u201d time for him and his family. The Pensions Regulator has started legal proceedings against Green and a decision whether to strip him of his knighthood will be made when official investigations have been completed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8b027a07b6d02031dae91983e3d8e581ee69fe7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8b027a07b6d02031dae91983e3d8e581ee69fe7/0_625_3374_2024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Chappell pleaded guilty to speeding in Andover, Hampshire, in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Chappell pleaded guilty to speeding in Andover, Hampshire, in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Dominic Chappell </strong>Spent much of his time since BHS collapsed juggling requests for information and interviews by regulatory bodies.

This paved the way for Chappell to become involved. Green scrapped the deal because a whistleblower delivered him a dossier revealing that Sutton had been convicted of fraud in France in 2002. Sutton and Chappell have since fallen out, with Sutton claiming that he could have saved BHS, while Chappell bled it dry. Sutton is now looking to revive his business career and move back to Monaco.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Uncertainty over the outlook for the UK economy after the Brexit vote in June has sent the pound plummeting to levels not seen since the 1980s. After the initial falls, Theresa May\u2019s announcement that she would trigger article 50 by March and continuing talk of a hard Brexit piled more pressure on sterling. As did an emergency cut in interest rates from the Bank of England, the effects of which were exacerbated by the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to raise US borrowing costs. Since the EU referendum, sterling has lost more than 17% of its value against the dollar and about 10% against the euro. The slump has been a mixed blessing for Britain\u2019s leading companies, with some clear winners and losers. Winners Businesses which make most of their money overseas are the most obvious beneficiaries of sterling\u2019s slide, since their earnings are now worth more when translated back into pounds. The luxury goods group Burberry, which generates about 85% of its sales abroad, has emerged as a clear winner, with overseas revenues bolstered even as its UK costs remain fixed. The icing on the cake is the weak pound attracting a growing number of overseas tourists, from China and elsewhere, to the UK keen to snap up its trademark checked scarves and camel trenchcoats. Burberry said this week the pound\u2019s decline had lifted sales to tourists in its London stores by 30%. Its shares have jumped by about a third since referendum day, adding more than \u00a31.5bn to its market capitalisation. Associated British Foods expects to benefit from the rising value of the euro against the pound. This will lift overseas profits, which last year made up half of the total, once they are translated back into sterling, and boost margins at ABF\u2019s sugar business, although the group\u2019s Primark fashion chain\u2019s UK profit margins are taking a hit from the pound\u2019s fall because clothes are largely bought in dollars. Mining groups listed on the London Stock Exchange but with operations everywhere from Australia to South America are also toasting the weak pound. Commodity prices are quoted in dollars, which lifts the value of the metals they mine in pound terms and boosts their profits. On top of that, precious metal miners such as Randgold Resources and Fresnillo have benefited from the recent strength of gold and silver, seen as havens in times of uncertainty. Other global businesses such as pharmaceuticals GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca benefit from the exchange of overseas earnings into pounds, and are also supported by the relatively stable outlook for their businesses (threats by the US to clamp down on supposedly excessive prices notwithstanding.) Banks have had a more mixed time. Again overseas earners are to the fore, with HSBC, which makes around three quarters of its profits in Asia, and Barclays gaining ground. HSBC has had a hefty \u00a337bn added to its stock market value since the referendum. Banks focused on the UK, such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group have performed less well. Bookmakers have benefitted too, recording their biggest non-sporting event ever at the referendum, with punters placing \u00a3100m in bets. Most punters bet Britain would stay in the EU. Losers The companies most obviously hit by the falling pound are those most exposed to the UK economy, with the cost of imported goods rising just as demand seems set to weaken. If consumers are faced with having to pay more in the shops, they are likely to be more cautious with their spending. Supermarkets are facing increasing price pressures, as shown in the so-called Marmitegate dispute between Britain\u2019s biggest grocer Tesco and consumer goods giant Unilever. Unilever raised prices on a range of products, from Marmite to Cif, by about 10% and halted deliveries to Tesco when the supermarket refused to accept the rises. This left Tesco short of several popular household brands. Although the dispute was resolved within days it is a sign of things to come in what is already a cut-throat and price-driven sector. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cLooking forward into 2017, the sector faces a new challenge from the rising cost of imported food, thanks to the fall in sterling, which will probably apply pressure to margins against such a competitive backdrop.\u201d Staying on the high street, Sports Direct issued another profit warning in October \u2013 its third of the year \u2013 after it lost \u00a315m in the currency markets as a result of the overnight \u201cflash crash\u201d in the value of sterling. Next estimated in August that its clothing prices would rise by up to 5% next year due to the pound\u2019s decline. Its chief executive, Lord Wolfson, said the cost of buying goods from abroad in sterling had risen by 9% for next year\u2019s fashions, although some of thehit would be offset by weakness in other currencies and its ability to squeeze better deals from suppliers. House prices are flat or falling as the weak pound dents consumer confidence and Brexit uncertainty pushes buyers out of deals. Housebuilders are facing weaker demand just as costs are rising. Bellway said some of its suppliers were likely to raise their prices due to the higher pound. Suppliers of imported timber have indicated that prices could rise by 10%. About 70% of Bellways\u2019 materials are sourced from Britain, with 20% coming from Europe. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to have what we would call some sort of Unilever moments with some of our suppliers,\u201d the chief executive, Ted Ayres, told Reuters. Shares in the building sector have been under pressure since the referendum, with Britain\u2019s biggest quoted housebuilder, Persimmon, losing 15% of its market value since the vote, equivalent to more than \u00a31bn. Airlines are also suffering, as the falling pound makes travellers more reluctant to venture abroad and consumers decide to conserve their cash. Ryanair recently warned that full-year profits would be lower than expected, while EasyJet suffered its first fall in annual profits for six years due to the weak pound and discounting fares. EasyJet expects another drop in the current financial year. Currency movements cost the airline \u00a388m as the pound\u2019s decline against the dollar increased fuel costs.",

Its shares have jumped by about a third since referendum day, adding more than \u00a31.5bn to its market capitalisation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/associatedbritishfoods\"><strong>Associated British Food</strong>s</a> expects<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/07/primark-owner-buoyed-by-stronger-euro\"> to benefit from the rising value of the euro against the pound</a>. This will lift overseas profits, which last year made up half of the total, once they are translated back into sterling, and boost margins at ABF\u2019s sugar business, although the group\u2019s Primark fashion chain\u2019s UK profit margins are taking a hit from the pound\u2019s fall because clothes are largely bought in dollars.</p> <p><strong>Mining groups</strong> listed on the London Stock Exchange but with operations everywhere from Australia to South America are also toasting the weak pound. Commodity prices are quoted in dollars, which lifts the value of the metals they mine in pound terms and boosts their profits. On top of that, precious metal miners such as <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> and <strong>Fresnillo</strong> have benefited from the recent strength of gold and silver, seen as havens in times of uncertainty.</p> <p>Other global businesses such as pharmaceuticals <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/glaxosmithkline\">GlaxoSmithKline</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/astrazeneca\">AstraZeneca</a></strong> benefit from the exchange of overseas earnings into pounds, and are also supported by the relatively stable outlook for their businesses (threats by the US to clamp down on supposedly excessive prices notwithstanding.)</p> <p>Banks have had a more mixed time. Again overseas earners are to the fore, with <strong>HSBC,</strong> which makes around three quarters of its profits in Asia, and <strong>Barclays </strong>gaining ground. HSBC has had a hefty \u00a337bn added to its stock market value since the referendum. Banks focused on the UK, such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group have performed less well.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/imi-plc--imi-/rns/imi-plc-interim-management-statement/201611100700098019O/\"></a></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/25/jimmy-choo-profit-revenue-grow-fall-sterling-store-openings\"></a></p> <p></p> <p><strong>Bookmakers</strong> have benefitted too<strong>, </strong>recording<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/22/eu-referendum-is-bookies-biggest-ever-non-sporting-event\">their biggest non-sporting event ever at the referendum</a>, with punters placing \u00a3100m in bets.

Its chief executive, Lord Wolfson, said the cost of buying goods from abroad in sterling had risen by 9% for next year\u2019s fashions, although some of thehit would be offset by weakness in other currencies and its ability to squeeze better deals from suppliers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices\">House prices are flat or falling</a> as the weak pound dents consumer confidence and Brexit uncertainty pushes buyers out of deals.
