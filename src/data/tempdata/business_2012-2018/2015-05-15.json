    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As families begin holding funerals for the eight people killed by Tuesday\u2019s Amtrak train derailment, officials say a safety mechanism that could have stopped the crash was close to being in operation. The seven-car Amtrak Northeast Regional train 188 left the tracks just after 9pm Tuesday outside of Philadelphia\u2019s 30th Street station, with more than 200 passengers on board. The train was traveling at more than 100mph, more than twice the posted speed limit. Federal and local authorities are investigating the accident, and criminal charges are possible. Had an existing safety system been in use, however, the accident may have been prevented. On the Amtrak line between New York and Philadelphia, transponders already on tracks could have slowed the speeding locomotive, but the system was awaiting testing to use the private airwaves that would have made the technology operational, federal officials said. The safety systems, called positive train control (PTC), were required on commuter and some commercial rail lines in 2008 by Congress in the Rail Safety Improvement Act. The law requires the systems to be implemented by the end of 2015. Federal railway regulators say the technology uses digital airwaves and GPS to slow speeding trains on bends, preventing speed-related derailments. The technology can also prevent head-on collisions, and stop trains from speeding through work zones, rail regulators say. In early March, the Federal Communications Commission had just finalized its approval a deal between the railroad and a private purveyor of digital frequencies to begin the safety devices. The deal was years in the making; Amtrak had been working to obtain the frequencies since 2011. However, Amtrak, a publicly funded railroad run by a for-profit corporation, struggled to complete the safety project under its existing funding. Congressional Republicans voted to further cut that funding Wednesday, just hours after the preventable accident killed eight people along the rail. No railroad has finished the safety upgrades to date, federal railway regulators said. \u201cKnowing many railroads were struggling both financially and technically to meet the deadline for PTC implementation at the end of this year, we have twice asked Congress for authority to better manage the deployment of this safety system as quickly and safely as possible,\u201d said Kevin F Thompson, spokesperson for the Federal Railroad Administration in a statement emailed to the Guardian. \u201cAdditionally, we have twice requested additional funding from Congress to help Amtrak and commuter railroads implement PTC. While we wait for Congress to act, we will continue to work with all of our stakeholders to ensure that railroads have PTC in use across the country as quickly as possible.\u201d On Wednesday, the House appropriations committee voted to cut Amtrak\u2019s funding by more than $250m from the $1.4bn it invested last year in the publicly funded, for-profit rail. In New York one of the first funerals for one of the crash victims was held Friday morning. Justin Zemser, 20, was a US naval academy midshipman, according to Reuters. Some of the first legal repercussions of the crash are beginning to surface. Philadelphia police are investigating it as a criminal incident. National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said in a Thursday media briefing that the train\u2019s brakes appeared to be working properly, and that there did not appear to be anything unusual in a track inspection. Federal transportation investigators have yet to interview the train\u2019s engineer, Brandon Bostian. Philadelphia police said Wednesday that Bostian had refused an in-depth interview, and left a police station with a lawyer. His attorney said Bostian has no recollection of the moments leading up to the crash, according to several media reports. However, Reuters reports that Bostian is scheduled to be interviewed by the NTSB in the coming days. \u201cWe look very much forward to the opportunity to interview him. We appreciate that opportunity. We feel that interview will provide us a lot of information,\u201d Sumwalt said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s banks have been told by the Bank of England that they need to rewrite the employment contracts of hundreds of staff receiving top-up payments alongside their salaries because of the European Union\u2019s bonus cap. Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England, says the contracts must be amended to comply with a ruling from the European Banking Authority, which says that many of the attempts by major banks in the UK to sidestep the restrictions on bonuses are breaching the spirit of the rules. Ever since last year \u2013 when the EU imposed a limit on bonuses to 100% of salary, or 200% if shareholders give their approval \u2013 banks have been looking for ways to prevent the pay of their top bankers from falling. Many started paying \u201callowances\u201d but the EBA concluded in October that these were effectively variable pay \u2013 with characteristics like bonuses \u2013 and in breach of the ratio imposed by the EU. Bailey, who remains opposed to the bonus cap, has now responded to the EBA\u2019s findings and told banks to make sure that any allowance \u2013 also known as role-based pay \u2013 cannot be withdrawn or clawed back as a bonus might be. Interviewed at the Reuters financial regulation summit, Bailey said: \u201cMany of them don\u2019t need to rip them [the contracts] up. They need to amend the terms. The effect is to make the allowances more fixed and the scope to withdraw them is that much more limited,\u201d he added. Most top bankers in the UK have been handed allowances to get around the bonus cap. Antony Jenkins, boss of Barclays, and his counterpart at Lloyds Banking Group, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, received around \u00a31m each in allowances. Stuart Gulliver, HSBC\u2019s chief executive, has been handed \u00a31.7m. The allowances are also being paid to senior individuals inside the organisations. The requirement is expected to be enforced for the 2015 bonus year \u2013 and have an impact on payouts next April. According to the EBA\u2019s analysis 39 banks in six EU states are paying allowances following the introduction of the bonus cap although it is not clear how many of these top-up payments were regarded as being variable rather than fixed pay. Bailey, who runs the Bank of England\u2019s regulation arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, is opposed to the bonus cap as he has warned it will push up salaries and make it more difficult to claw back pay when losses occur later. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad policy and it\u2019s got the wrong incentives,\u201d Bailey told the Reuters conference. Bailey also revealed he had been in contact with HSBC about its ongoing review about whether to keep its headquarters in the UK, where it has been based since 1992 following the taking over of Midland Bank. \u201cIt is entirely natural that as an institution your shareholders should demand that you do this assessment. As a private organisation they should do it,\u201d Bailey was reported as saying. He later gave a speech in Cambridge in which he outlined the Bank of England\u2019s approach to identifying risks in the financial system and those which could arise from \u201cshadow banks\u201d which can provide a means of finance outside the traditional banking sector. \u201cPut simply, it is quite often said that we are living in unprecedented times in the performance of financial markets,\u201d Bailey said. Bailey discussed the increasing used of automated trading strategies \u2013 where algorithms replace human decision making \u2013 which have felt the impact of sudden market moves . He provided two examples: bond market volatility on October 15 last year; and the currency market gyrations on January 15 when the Swiss central bank removed the Swiss franc floor against the euro. Regulators needed to be \u201ckeenly interested\u201d in such events, said Bailey. Referring to the events of 15 January, he said the automated trading systems used by banks to protect their trading positions were unable to operate and dealers resorted to using telephones. \u201cWhilst each algorithm operating independently may well have been quite prudently calibrated to protect the bank from building an exposure that exceeded its risk appetite, collectively the impact on market liquidity was akin, albeit temporarily, to a cascading failure across a power grid\u201d.",

They had been due on Friday. The payment came as Greece remained locked in talks with its creditors in an effort to release \u20ac7.2bn of bailout funds to avoid a default and exit from the eurozone. In a sign the leftist Syriza government was preparing to compromise over some of the reforms demanded by Brussels and the International Monetary Fund, it said it would push ahead with privatisation of its biggest port, Piraeus. It is in talks with China\u2019s Cosco Group, which manages two container piers at the port, about selling a majority stake. \u201cWe are in very advanced talks to expand this cooperation very soon in relation with the inclusion of a railway network as well,\u201d the defence minister, Panos Kammenos, told an economic conference in Athens. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, said his country was \u201cvery close\u201d to reaching a vital deal with bailout lenders, but insisted there was \u201cno possibility\u201d of giving in to key demands including further cuts to pensions and wages. Tsipras said the government had not abandoned its goal to try to persuade lenders to restructure Greece\u2019s debt. \u201cIt appears that we have reached common ground with the institutions on a number of issues, and that makes us optimistic that we are really very close to an agreement,\u201d Tsipras said, noting convergence on harmonised sales tax rates and tax administration reforms. \u201cBut several issues remain open ... I want to reassure the Greek people that there is no chance or possibility for the Greek government to retreat on the issue of wages and pensions. Wage earners and pensioners have suffered enough.\u201d Earlier in the week, Greece paid $750m due to the IMF, albeit by using a reserve account held at the IMF itself, while the European Central Bank raised the level of emergency funding for Greek banks by \u20ac1.1bn to \u20ac80bn. Athens has also called for its embassies and consulates to forward any cash reserves in an effort to avoid running out of funds before a deal with creditors is reached. But it ran into a setback when the parliamentary speaker refused to transfer Hellenic parliament cash to the state. Meanwhile, DBRS ratings agency downgraded Greece further into junk status, cutting it from B to CCC with a negative outlook. \u201cThe current downgrade is due to a further increase in uncertainty over whether Greece and its creditors will reach an agreement on a programme that restores macroeconomic stability and improves Greece\u2019s cash position,\u201d it said. \u201cIn the absence of an agreement, financing sources appear to be insufficient to meet Greece\u2019s financing needs over the foreseeable future.\u201d Tsipras reportedly plans to press fellow European leaders about the bailout deadlock on the sidelines of a summit in Latvia next week.",

Whether you\u2019re Labour, Conservative or Lib Dem, I believe everybody wants to do better for employees,\u201d said the Tory peer. Rose was speaking in response to pressure from living wage campaigners at the internet grocer\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in London. \u201cI believe in the creation of wealth. If you don\u2019t create wealth then you can\u2019t distribute it fairly. That\u2019s the reason why people voted the way they did last time,\u201d Rose said. \u201cFive years ago people couldn\u2019t get jobs. That was the real poverty issue.\u201d Rose added that \u201cmost boards understand the pressures of living at the bottom end of society.\u201d His comments came as 20% of shareholders voted against Ocado\u2019s remuneration report. Rose, who earns \u00a3200,000 a year as Ocado chairman and was handed \u00a3400,000 of free shares when he joined the company, said Ocado had the \u201caspiration\u201d to move towards the living wage for all its employees. But he would not commit the internet grocer to paying the living wage rate of \u00a39.15 an hour in London and \u00a37.85 across the rest of the UK. \u201cWe have to balance off what we can afford to do and what is right to do,\u201d he said. Rose admitted that fair wages were \u201cobviously something that all in society UK today need to be talking and thinking about,\u201d as he faced questions at Ocado\u2019s board meeting from Amy Hulme, a living wage campaigner working with ShareAction. Hulme told Ocado\u2019s board and a handful of investors, who met in the gilded surroundings of Goldman Sachs\u2019 offices off Fleet Street in central London: \u201cI\u2019m concerned that staff working for Ocado may need to use foodbanks.\u201d Her carefully presented question is part of a wider campaign, backed by pressure groups Citizens UK and ShareAction, under which activists will attend the annual meetings of at least 10 retailers. Rose said the vast majority of Ocado\u2019s staff were already earning above the living wage, once benefits like bonuses were taken into account. He said employees received a 15% staff discount, pension scheme, free shares and the opportunity to participate in a share savings scheme. \u201cTaken together that\u2019s a fair package, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re complacent and take it for granted and that we don\u2019t think that we can improve things but on balance I think we are doing the right thing,\u201d he said. Hulme responded: \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic that you refer to so many benefits but that doesn\u2019t help with day to day affording to live. I would encourage the board to think hard about paying the living wage.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "More weak US data - including industrial production and consumer sentiment figures - sent the dollar lower on the basis that any rate rise is pushed further into the distance, and as a consequence, lifted the euro. So European markets, particularly export-heavy Germany - lost early gains and ended the week on a downbeat note. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 12.55 points or 0.18% at 6960.49 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.98% at 11,447.03 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.71% at 4993.82 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.32% to 23,473.46 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.71% at 11,317.3 The Athens market closed 2.57% lower at 811.98 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 16 points or 0.09% lower. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back next week. Here\u2019s the rationale for the DBRS downgrade, which has come ahead of the next scheduled rating announcement for Greece from the agency on 12 June : The deviation of this review from the calendar is due to an increase in uncertainty over government policies and Greece\u2019s capacity to remain current on its debt. DBRS placed the ratings Under Review on 4 February 2015 to reflect DBRS\u2019s elevated concern over the potential for a deterioration in Greece\u2019s creditworthiness as a result of actions by the Greek government following the general elections on 25 January 2015. In light of the change in government, and given the importance of financial assistance from the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, DBRS\u2019s concern over Greece\u2019s ability to meet its financing needs had increased. The current downgrade is due to a further increase in uncertainty over whether Greece and its creditors will reach an agreement on a program that restores macroeconomic stability and improves Greece\u2019s cash position. In the absence of an agreement, financing sources appear to be insufficient to meet Greece\u2019s financing needs over the foreseeable future. This shortfall is due to the lack of access to bond markets, as well as a delay in an agreement between Greece and its official sector creditors over the conditions that the creditors require in exchange for continuing the existing financial assistance program, or entering a new longer term lending program. DBRS\u2019s view is that a new longer term program is likely to be necessary to restore macroeconomic stabilization. The delay in an agreement has had an adverse impact on the economic recovery, on financial stability, and on the fiscal stance. The Negative trend reflects the risk of a missed payment to official creditors, or the further buildup of arrears to domestic agents. In the coming weeks Greece faces a series of payments to the IMF and the ECB. DBRS\u2019s view is that a default to these official sector creditors would likely cause an acceleration in the withdrawal of deposits from Greek banks, and would further undermine growth prospects. This is turn would make it more difficult for Greece to generate primary fiscal surpluses. Such a default could also jeopardize ECB Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA), without which Greek banks could face lower liquidity buffers and run the risk of insolvency. Ratings agency DBRS has downgraded Greece to CCC, bringing it into line with Fitch. Here\u2019s more about Greece\u2019s efforts to scrape together cash: Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is hoping to bring up the deadlock with the country\u2019s creditors at next week\u2019s summit in Latvia, a meeting mainly designed to discuss eastern Europe, Greek newspaper Kathimerini has reported: Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras plans to press fellow European Union leaders to help resolve the deadlock in talks with creditors, inserting his country\u2019s crisis into an EU summit intended to discuss eastern Europe. Tsipras will raise the standoff in bailout negotiations on the sidelines of talks to be held May 21-22 in Riga, Latvia, according to a Greek government official. Another European official said Tsipras was expected to attend the summit, while saying that Greece is not on the meeting\u2019s agenda. Both officials asked not to be named as the diplomacy is not public. European policy makers are giving few clues on the state of Greece\u2019s crisis negotiations as investors try to figure out just how much money the country has left in its coffers after surviving another week. The 110-day-long standoff has triggered a liquidity squeeze, pulling the country back into a double-dip recession, amid renewed doubts over its place in the euro area. \u201cEven if they have a deal before the bailout extension ends at the end of June, we don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get access to the full remaining \u20ac7.2bn of the current bailout extension,\u201d Stephen Gallo, the European head of currency strategy at Bank of Montreal in London, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. With the European Central unlikely to \u201crush in\u201d and buy Greek bonds, the situation in Greece \u201cis not over for a long time,\u201d he said. Back to Greece, and the government has paid public sector wages due today, a total of around \u20ac500m, according to the finance ministry. Reuters reports: Athens, which had been expected to easily make Friday\u2019s payments, will find it harder to meet wage and pension commitments later this month as well as debt payments in June. \u201cThe mid-May payments of wages and pensions ... were made within the scheduled time frame,\u201d the ministry said. A ministry official said that the amount paid was about \u20ac500m. In a sign of the precarious nature of Greece\u2019s finances, the ministry also said that there was a delay in paying workers at a fund that disburses EU subsidies to farmers (OPEKEPE) \u201cdue to bureaucratic reasons\u201d, but promised the funds would be paid later on Friday. Athens has been locked in talks with its international lenders on a cash-for-reforms deal for months. The state emptied an International Monetary Fund reserves account to meet a scheduled payment to the Fund this week. For months, the government has been borrowing from different parts of the state administration, including OPEKEPE, to pay the wages and pensions of public sector workers. Wall Street is slightly lower after the day\u2019s disappointing data. On the consumer confidence figures, James Knightley of ING Bank said the fall was a puzzle: The bad news just keeps on coming for the US right now with the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index having fallen sharply in May to 88.6 versus 95.9 in April. Given the consensus prediction was 95.9 this is a big miss and is a little perplexing. After all, employment is rising, real incomes are rising, equities are rising and the housing market is performing ok. It is possible that the weakness in first quarter GDP numbers and higher Treasury yields have caused some concern and that gasoline prices have moved a little higher, but things don\u2019t seem bad enough to justify the steepest drop in confidence in over two years. The report again implies little prospect of imminent policy tightening, but we suspect that the story isn\u2019t as bad as these numbers suggests. More weak US data. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index has fallen from 95.9 in April to 88.6, much lower than the 96 figure analysts had been expecting and a seven month low. Reaction to April\u2019s weaker-than-expected US industrial production numbers is coming in. Coupled with the weak US retail sales figures earlier this week, the feeling is that the second quarter didn\u2019t get off to the best of starts following a shocking first quarter when GDP increased at an annual rate of just 0.2%. James Knightley, economist at ING: Industrial output has now fallen for five straight months, which is not the sort of environment in which the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Certainly, the oil price effect has been in play and dented oil and gas output, but manufacturing has also been subdued. With retail sales also looking fairly soft, expectations of a decent bounce in Q2 GDP after Q1\u2019s weakness are starting to evaporate. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics: Industrial production in April was dragged down by a drop back in utilities output, as the earlier weather-related distortion was unwound, and a sharp decline in oil and gas drilling. Elsewhere, the modest rebound in the Empire State manufacturing index to +3.1 in May, from -1.2, indicates that the stronger dollar is still restraining factory sector activity. Nevertheless, the drop back in the dollar over the past month will provide a little relief. Furthermore, the survey evidence on the services sector is much more upbeat. Accordingly, even if export-orientated manufacturers continue to struggle, stronger domestic demand can still drive a pick-up in GDP growth. US markets have opened slightly higher, following the S&amp;P 500\u2019s record high on Thursday. Dow Jones: +0.02% at 18,256.77 S&amp;P 500: +0.08% at 2,122.7 Nasdaq: +0.2 at 5,059.72 US industrial production fell for a fifth month in April, down 0.3% (following a revised 0.3% fall in March). Economists polled by Reuters had predicted a 0.1% increase. It was dragged down by falls in both mining and utilities. Manufacturing output was flat over the month according to the Federal Reserve, following a 0.3% increase in March. The Guardian\u2019s Helena Smith also reports that along with privatisations - a red line the government had said it would not cross - it is now also considering: A \u201cmobility scheme\u201d that would see staff being laid off in the health and education sector. The introduction of a new employment evaluation scheme under pressure from foreign lenders. Back in Greece, former deputy premier Evangelos Venizelos has accused the anti-austerity government of being a \u201cprisoner to its pre-election pledges\u201d. He said: The government can\u2019t agree with its own members and parliamentarians and because of this, it can\u2019t conduct a real and effective negotiation [with the debt-stricken country\u2019s creditors]. The cost that the country has been paying, for the last four months, is huge. And that is down to the fact that everyone in the government is a prisoner of its pre-election promises. This vicious circle has to end. Over in the US - where every piece of data is being examined for its impact on the Federal Reserve\u2019s plan for possible interest rate rises - New York manufacturing activity accelerated in May after weakening for three consecutive months. The New York Fed\u2019s Empire State business conditions index rose to 3.09 in May from -1.19 in April, but this was below analysts expectations of an improvement to 5. The new orders index improved to 3.85 after -6 in April. Eurozone bond yields have fallen (reflecting higher prices), following weeks of volatility and price swings. German 10-year yields dropped seven basis points to 0.64%, but were still above the record low of 0.05% hit last month. Spanish, Italian and Portuguese 10-year yields were also down nine basis points at 1.75%, 1.79%, and 2.33% respectively. Over in Athens the rhetoric reached boiling point this morning. Both in and outside the ruling Syriza party, tempers are fraying as it becomes increasingly clear that the leftist-led government is slowly rolling back on its pre-election promises. Addressing the annual Economist conference in Athens this morning, Panagiotis Lafazanis, the energy minister and head of Syriza\u2019s militant far left faction, lashed out at Europe saying its \u201cextreme unilateral decisions\u201d were destroying the continent. \u201cEurope\u2019s problem is not doomed, leftist-(led) Greece, but Europe\u2019s extreme unilateral decisions that are a problem for Greece,\u201d he railed. \u201cThere are several powerful circles in the European Union and the International Monetary Fund who, right now, are trying to suffocate and strangle the experiment that is the Greek left.\u201d Lafazanis, who is regarded as the third most senior cabinet minister after prime minister Alexis Tsipras and his deputy Yannis Dragasakis, said the ultimate aim of such circles was to kick Greece out of the eurozone. \u201cIf some are planning to create an European architecture in which Greece is excluded, because it will not submit, then they should know that such a Europe will be disabled and crippled.\u201d European markets are still up, with the FTSE back above 7,000. Investor confidence has been boosted by Mario Draghi\u2019s pledge to press ahead with the ECB\u2019s \u00a31.1 trillion bond-buying programme (despite accelerating growth and the diminishing threat of deflation), and by the expectation that an imminent US rate rise is no longer on the table. FTSE 100: +0.4% at 7,001.2 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.3% at 11,598.63 France\u2019s CAC: 0.4% at 5,051.48 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: 0.4% at 23,645.36 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.04% at 11,402.8 Holger Schmieding, economist at Berenberg, believes there is a 70% chance Greek will do just enough to stay in the euro. On current information, Greece looks likely to run out of money in late May or early June. Reality seems to be gradually dawning on prime minister Tsipras. Just back from a one-day visit to beautiful Thessaloniki, my somewhat superficial impression is that the overall mood in Greece is becoming much more realistic after an initial post-election honeymoon period for Syriza and its policy ideas. Despite serious risks, we continue to see a 70% probability that Tsipras will do sufficient u-turns in the end to keep Greece in the euro. With intense negotiations on various levels, we may \u2013 with luck \u2013 hear about some further progress early next week, possibly leading to a first deal by the end of May. While differences remain huge, negotiators seem to be finally tackling the really thorny issues of pension and labour reforms as well as the overall size of the needed fiscal correction. But that is not the end of the story. The current negotiations are about completing the current bailout programme that runs until the end of June, with a \u20ac7.2bn tranche pending. Once concluded, these talks will have to be followed immediately thereafter by equally difficult discussions on a third bailout and by regular progress reviews thereafter that could again prove very contentious. In short: even if Tsipras finally strikes the necessary deals with Greece\u2019s creditors and thus ends the recession which he has caused himself, the future recovery will likely be more shallow than that of Spain until Greece manages to restore trust. Populism doesn\u2019t come cheap. Poul Thomsen, the man in charge of the Greek programme at the International Monetary Fund updated the IMF\u2019s executive board on Thursday. According to reports, Thomsen said it was positive that the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras had become more closely involved in negotiations with the country\u2019s creditors. However, he noted some serious obstacles to progress, including a lack of access to Greek data, and differences of opinion on labour issues, pensions, fiscal policy for 2015 and administrative reform. Thomsen said the IMF would be \u201cflexible\u201d about agreeing to revise down Greece\u2019s budget primary surplus target of 3% of GDP, without giving an alternative figure. One man embarked on a 1,550 mile road trip across Greece to highlight the remnants of Greece\u2019s industrial past. Yannis Behrakis from Reuters found abandoned factories that once made everything from marble to nuts and cooking oil. Since shutting up shop, most of them have been looted, which adds to the sense of desolation. The full picture gallery is here. While the jump in construction output in March and the the upward revision for Q1 are positives, some of the details in the ONS report are not so pretty. New housing construction fell 3.4% in the first quarter, at a time when politicians/the industry is constantly talking about the desperate need for new homes. All new work (including public sector building and commercial property, as well as housing) was down 1.7% over the quarter. Repair and maintenance work fell by 0.2% in Q1. The big jump in construction output in March, combined with upward revisions for January and February, has brightened the picture for the first quarter overall. The ONS now estimates that the sector shrank by 1.1% in the first three months of the year, compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. Still in negative territory, but not as bad as the 1.6% decline the statistics agency had pencilled in at the time of the first estimate of first-quarter GDP last month. It increases the chance that overall GDP growth will be revised up modestly to 0.4% from 0.3% later this month. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight: Construction output saw a much-needed and welcome rebound in March. However, this was not enough to prevent marked contraction of 1.1% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter. At least though, the contraction in construction output in the first quarter at 1.1% quarter-on-quarter was less than the 1.6% estimated in the preliminary national accounts data. Consequently, there now looks to be a very good chance that GDP growth in the first quarter will be revised up to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter from 0.3% when the next estimate comes out on 28 May. Construction output jumped 3.9% in March according to the Office for National Statistics. That was better than the 2.5% increase forecast by economists. It took the annual rate of growth to 1.6% from -0.2% in February. The ONS also revised the data for February, to show a smaller, 0.3% decline after initially reporting a 0.9% fall in construction output. More soon. Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor for prudential regulation, has been speaking in London about the state of UK banks. Here are the main points he\u2019s been making at the Reuters regulation summit. A 2019 deadline for UK\u2019s biggest banks to ringfence their retail businesses from riskier operations is \u201ctight\u201d but on track. The Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority has been in touch with HSBC about its review of where to locate its headquarters, after it said it was considering moving its HQ out of London. UK banks must rewrite contracts for senior staff to comply with new EU rules banning top-up \u201callowances\u201d that breach a cap on bonuses. Misconduct revelations are still overshadowing the UK banking industry, eventually there has to be an end point to the PPI compensation process. \u201cThere must be a point where you say \u2018enough is enough\u2019, but that isn\u2019t easy\u201d. Greece is in advanced talks with China\u2019s Cosco over the privatisation of its largest port at Piraeus. In a sign that Greece is willing to make some compromises as it tries to seal a deal for emergency funding from its creditors, the country\u2019s defence minister said the government was in detailed discussion with China about the port. Cosco already manages two container piers at the port and is keen to get hold of a majority stake. Greece unblocked the sale of a 51% stake (after prime minister Alexis Tsipras earlier blocked the sale of a 67% stake) and has invited Cosco and two other investors to submit bids by September. Speaking at a conference in Athens on Friday, defence minister Panos Kammenos said: We are in very advanced talks to expand this co-operation very soon in relation with the inclusion of a railway network as well. Markets have indeed opened higher. FTSE 100: +0.2% Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.4% France\u2019s CAC: 0.3% Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.3% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.3% And this is the view of Mike van Dulken and Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets, in a morning note titled: Another Mario speech, another boost for markets. FTSE100 Index called to open +20 points at 6995, having recovered from yet another test below 6900 to revisit 7000. The index continues to hold above its 100-day moving average (6915) with Bulls remaining optimistic of a revisit of 7127 highs while the bears refuse to ignore falling highs from mid-April hoping for another drop back towards 6900, or lower. Watch levels: Bullish 7010, Bearish 6950. The positive opening call comes after the FTSE100 gained 3.4% in Thursday trading as US Fed member commentary appeared to take a June interest rate rise off the cards. In Europe, Mario Draghi indicated yesterday that the eurozone\u2019s QE programme would continue until the 2% inflation target is reached and deemed sustainable. The comments buoyed both bonds and equities in the euro area and contributed to rebounds and record closes in the US overnight. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European markets are expected to open mainly higher this morning after a record high finish for the S&amp;P 500 last night. In the US, the prospect of an imminent rate rise appears to be off the table, while the ECB\u2019s president Mario Draghi defended the central bank\u2019s \u20ac1.1 trillion QE programme and vowed to continue. Speaking in Washington, he said: After almost seven years of a debilitating sequence of crises, firms and households are very hesitant to take on economic risk. For this reason quite some time is needed before we can declare success, and our monetary policy stimulus will stay in place as long as needed for its objective to be fully achieved on a truly sustained basis.

DBRS placed the ratings Under Review on 4 February 2015 to reflect DBRS\u2019s elevated concern over the potential for a deterioration in Greece\u2019s creditworthiness as a result of actions by the Greek government following the general elections on 25 January 2015. In light of the change in government, and given the importance of financial assistance from the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, DBRS\u2019s concern over Greece\u2019s ability to meet its financing needs had increased.</p> <p>The current downgrade is due to a further increase in uncertainty over whether Greece and its creditors will reach an agreement on a program that restores macroeconomic stability and improves Greece\u2019s cash position. In the absence of an agreement, financing sources appear to be insufficient to meet Greece\u2019s financing needs over the foreseeable future. This shortfall is due to the lack of access to bond markets, as well as a delay in an agreement between Greece and its official sector creditors over the conditions that the creditors require in exchange for continuing the existing financial assistance program, or entering a new longer term lending program. DBRS\u2019s view is that a new longer term program is likely to be necessary to restore macroeconomic stabilization. The delay in an agreement has had an adverse impact on the economic recovery, on financial stability, and on the fiscal stance.</p> <p>The Negative trend reflects the risk of a missed payment to official creditors, or the further buildup of arrears to domestic agents. In the coming weeks Greece faces a series of payments to the IMF and the ECB. DBRS\u2019s view is that a default to these official sector creditors would likely cause an acceleration in the withdrawal of deposits from Greek banks, and would further undermine growth prospects. This is turn would make it more difficult for Greece to generate primary fiscal surpluses. Such a default could also jeopardize ECB Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA), without which Greek banks could face lower liquidity buffers and run the risk of insolvency.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55561f5ee4b0e17470c6f329\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-05-15T16:33:31.307Z\">5.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ratings agency DBRS downgrades Greece</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ratings agency DBRS has downgraded Greece to CCC, bringing it into line with Fitch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DBRSRatings/statuses/599249642359025665\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">DBRS Downgrades Greece to CCC (high) Negative Trend - See more at: <a href=\"http://t.co/yPMA73Y9Ik\">http://t.co/yPMA73Y9Ik</a></p>&mdash;

Reality seems to be gradually dawning on prime minister Tsipras. Just back from a one-day visit to beautiful Thessaloniki, my somewhat superficial impression is that the overall mood in Greece is becoming much more realistic after an initial post-election honeymoon period for Syriza and its policy ideas.</p> <p>Despite serious risks, we continue to see a 70% probability that Tsipras will do sufficient u-turns in the end to keep Greece in the euro. With intense negotiations on various levels, we may \u2013 with luck \u2013 hear about some further progress early next week, possibly leading to a first deal by the end of May. While differences remain huge, negotiators seem to be finally tackling the really thorny issues of pension and labour reforms as well as the overall size of the needed fiscal correction.</p> <p>But that is not the end of the story. The current negotiations are about completing the current bailout programme that runs until the end of June, with a \u20ac7.2bn tranche pending. Once concluded, these talks will have to be followed immediately thereafter by equally difficult discussions on a third bailout and by regular progress reviews thereafter that could again prove very contentious.</p> <p>In short: even if Tsipras finally strikes the necessary deals with Greece\u2019s creditors and thus ends the recession which he has caused himself, the future recovery will likely be more shallow than that of Spain until Greece manages to restore trust.

      "bodyText": "An investment firm backed by South Africa\u2019s fourth-richest man has agreed to pay \u00a3780m for a majority stake in the UK fashion retailer New Look. Brait, which is controlled by the South African billionaire Christo Wiese, is buying 90% of the high street chain. It is the firm\u2019s second big foray into the UK market in the past month after it agreed to buy Sir Richard Branson\u2019s 80% stake in the Virgin Active fitness chain for \u00a3682m. Brait owns 19% of Iceland, the British food retailer, and 87% of Premier, a South African food maker. Wiese, who owns 35% of Brait and whose fortune is valued at $7bn (\u00a34.4bn), said after buying Virgin Active that Brait had a further $2bn to spend. He has been scouring the UK for deals to add to the firm\u2019s portfolio. BHS had been tipped as a potential acquisition before it was sold to a consortium this year. New Look was founded in 1969 in Taunton, Somerset, and now has 569 UK stores and another 200 in Europe, China, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Tom Singh, the 65-year-old who opened the first New Look shop, owns 22% of the business worth \u00a3190m. Singh, whose family\u2019s wealth is estimated at \u00a3530m by the Sunday Times Rich List, will cash in most of his holding but keep a stake in the business. The private equity firms Apax and Permira have owned the majority of New Look since 2004. Buyout firms usually sell their investments within five years but many were left holding on to businesses for much longer because of the financial crisis. New Look\u2019s fortunes have been chequered in the UK where it has been closing stores while expanding in China and Poland. Sales excluding store openings and closures fell 1% in the final three months of 2014 despite online sales jumping by a third. The deal values New Look at \u00a31.9bn once debt is included. Anders Kristiansen, New Look\u2019s chief executive since early 2013, and his senior team will stay at the business. He said Brait supported his goals of international expansion, increasing online sales and developing new lines such as cosmetics and menswear. Kristiansen said: \u201cWe have considered all the options and we thought Brait\u2019s offer was the best deal. It gives us stability. They are not private equity; they are long-term investors and they are going to hold the business for many, many years. They have bought into the strategy we started two years ago and they want us to go faster, not slower.\u201d He said in February New Look might launch an initial public offering (IPO) and that it aimed to open more than 50 extra stores in China by April 2016. Last year it pulled out of Russia and sold the cheap French clothes chain Mim after years of disappointing performance. Nick Bubb, a retail analyst, said: \u201cThe long-suffering private equity investors, Apax and Permira, were desperate to sell after no less than 11 years of ownership. An IPO never looked a runner, given New Look\u2019s very chequered UK history and the unproven Chinese potential. So Christo Wiese has probably been able to drive quite a hard bargain.\u201d Brait\u2019s purchase of New Look will pit the chain against Pep &amp; Co, a fashion retailer backed separately by Wiese that is due to launch in the next few months. A long story of retail success Christo Wiese, backer of the investment company that has bought New Look, has made a reported $7bn fortune by investing in a vast array of retailers and other businesses including a platinum and gem miner. The 73-year old, the son of a petrol station owner and farmer from the harsh Northern Cape, initially trained as a lawyer. But he then joined Pep Stores, a clothing retailer co-founded by his parents at the height of the apartheid era. Wiese went on to buy supermarket chain Shoprite, the first in an audacious series of deals that have gained him a reputation as a serial risk-taker and a fortune that makes him South Africa\u2019s fifth richest man. Those who know him say Wiese is charming and charismatic with a love of telling long stories. Despite his background in retailing he likes to back people he trusts and monitor investments at arms length rather than obsessing over every detail. That\u2019s hardly surprising. As well as backing Brait, the investment company that has bought New Look, Wiese\u2019s investments include Pepkor, which now owns 3,700 clothes stores worldwide, Shoprite and other interests including the mining company, a Kalahari game reserve and a vineyard. Not everything has worked out for Wiese. His family previously controlled a group of low-price chains including Poundstretcher, What Everyone Wants and Brunswick Warehouse, at one time listed on the London Stock Exchange as Brown &amp; Jackson. But after years of poor performance the South Africans sold their remaining interest to the Tayub family, the Midlands cash and carry moguls. In 2009 Wiese also found himself in an awkward position when $1m was found in his luggage and confiscated at London City Airport. The cash was finally returned in 2012.",

      "body": "<p>An investment firm backed by South Africa\u2019s fourth-richest man has agreed to pay \u00a3780m for a majority stake in the UK fashion retailer New Look.</p> <p>Brait, which is controlled by the South African billionaire Christo Wiese, is buying 90% of the high street chain. It is the firm\u2019s second big foray into the UK market in the past month after it <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/16/virgin-active-stake-sold-to-south-africas-brait\">agreed to buy</a> Sir Richard Branson\u2019s 80% stake in the Virgin Active fitness chain for \u00a3682m.</p> <p>Brait owns 19% of Iceland, the British food retailer, and 87% of Premier, a South African food maker. Wiese, who owns 35% of Brait and whose fortune is valued at $7bn (\u00a34.4bn), said after buying Virgin Active that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-23/wiese-s-brait-has-2-billion-to-spend-after-virgin-active-deal\">Brait had a further $2bn to spend</a>. </p> <p>He has been scouring the UK for deals to add to the firm\u2019s portfolio. BHS had been tipped as a potential acquisition before it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/12/sir-philip-green-sells-off-lossmaking-bhs\">sold to a consortium</a> this year. </p> <p>New Look was founded in 1969 in Taunton, Somerset, and now has 569 UK stores and another 200 in Europe, China, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. </p> <p>Tom Singh, the 65-year-old who opened the first New Look shop, owns 22% of the business worth \u00a3190m. Singh, whose family\u2019s wealth is estimated at \u00a3530m by the Sunday Times Rich List, will cash in most of his holding but keep a stake in the business.<br></p> <p>The private equity firms Apax and Permira have owned the majority of New Look since 2004. Buyout firms usually sell their investments within five years but many were left holding on to businesses for much longer because of the financial crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"new look fashion chain guardian\">New Look\u2019s fortunes have been chequered in the UK</a> where it has been closing stores while expanding in China and Poland. Sales excluding store openings and closures fell 1% in the final three months of 2014 despite online sales jumping by a third. The deal values New Look at \u00a31.9bn once debt is included. </p> <p>Anders Kristiansen, New Look\u2019s chief executive since early 2013, and his senior team will stay at the business. He said Brait supported his goals of international expansion, increasing online sales and developing new lines such as cosmetics and menswear.</p> <p>Kristiansen said: \u201cWe have considered all the options and we thought Brait\u2019s offer was the best deal. It gives us stability. They are not private equity; they are long-term investors and they are going to hold the business for many, many years. They have bought into the strategy we started two years ago and they want us to go faster, not slower.\u201d</p> <p>He <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/10/new-look-ipo-chinese-expansion-fashion-stores-china \">said in February</a> New Look might launch an initial public offering (IPO) and that it aimed to open more than 50 extra stores in China by April 2016. Last year it pulled out of Russia and sold the cheap French clothes chain Mim after years of disappointing performance.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Nick Bubb, a retail analyst, said: \u201cThe long-suffering private equity investors, Apax and Permira, were desperate to sell after no less than 11 years of ownership. An IPO never looked a runner, given New Look\u2019s very chequered UK history and the unproven Chinese potential. So Christo Wiese has probably been able to drive quite a hard bargain.\u201d</p> <p>Brait\u2019s purchase of New Look will pit the chain against Pep &amp; Co, a fashion retailer backed separately by Wiese that is due to launch in the next few months. </p> <h2>A long story of retail success</h2> <p>Christo Wiese, backer of the investment company that has bought New Look, has made a reported $7bn fortune by investing in a vast array of retailers and other businesses including a platinum and gem miner.</p> <p>The 73-year old, the son of a petrol station owner and farmer from the harsh Northern Cape, initially trained as a lawyer. But he then joined Pep Stores, a clothing retailer co-founded by his parents at the height of the apartheid era.</p> <p>Wiese went on to buy supermarket chain Shoprite, the first in an audacious series of deals that have gained him a reputation as a serial risk-taker and a fortune that makes him South Africa\u2019s fifth richest man.</p> <p>Those who know him say Wiese is charming and charismatic with a love of telling long stories. Despite his background in retailing he likes to back people he trusts and monitor investments at arms length rather than obsessing over every detail.</p> <p>That\u2019s hardly surprising. As well as backing Brait, the investment company that has bought New Look, Wiese\u2019s investments include Pepkor, which now owns 3,700 clothes stores worldwide, Shoprite and other interests including the mining company, a Kalahari game reserve and a vineyard.</p> <p>Not everything has worked out for Wiese. His family previously controlled a group of low-price chains including Poundstretcher, What Everyone Wants and Brunswick Warehouse, at one time listed on the London Stock Exchange as Brown &amp; Jackson. But after years of poor performance the South Africans sold their remaining interest to the Tayub family, the Midlands cash and carry moguls.</p> <p>In 2009 Wiese also found himself in an awkward position when $1m was found in his luggage and confiscated at London City Airport. The cash was finally returned in 2012.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The boss of London\u2019s Meantime Brewing Company has defended the independent beer maker\u2019s decision to sell out to SAB Miller, in a deal that allows the global brewer behind the Peroni and Miller brands to muscle in on the UK craft brewing boom. Nick Miller, Meantime\u2019s chief executive, said the craft tag was increasingly redundant and that selling to the world\u2019s second-biggest brewer would not harm the company\u2019s reputation, built up over 16 years as a standalone producer. \u201cI think the term \u2018craft\u2019 will disappear. It will become the norm that we have craft beer whether the brewer is big or small. If you stay true to what you believe in, which is high quality premium beers... I think the drinker will welcome that.\u201d Meantime was founded in 1999 by brewer Alastair Hook in a flat in Greenwich and its most popular brews include London lager, London pale ale and London porter. It now operates from a modern 120,000 hectolitre brewery in Greenwich and has two pubs, the Greenwich Union and the Old Brewery bar. SAB Miller said the deal, sealed for an undisclosed sum, would give it a presence in the fastest growing part of the UK beer market. It plans to increase sales of Meantime beer in Britain beyond the brewer\u2019s London base and is considering exporting to Europe. Meantime increased production by 58% last year as demand for craft beers increased. Growth has quickened this year, Miller said. The overall UK beer market grew by 1% in 2014. Britain is experiencing a surge in craft brewing. Even as pubs close at a rate of about 30 a week, the number of breweries has increased by 10% over each of the past two years to more than 1,400 \u2013 the most since the 1940s. The boom is led by small operations making distinctive ales in and around London, Leeds and other major cities. Mindful that the independent status of craft brewers contributes to their popularity, SAB Miller and Meantime stressed that Meantime would keep its autonomy and distinct character. SAB Miller\u2019s purchase of Meantime is a further sign that craft beer, originally associated with hipsters, beards and tattoos, is going mainstream. JD Wetherspoon, the pub chain, has started stocking beers made by BrewDog, the avowedly anti-establishment Scottish brewery. Craft beer is now included in the basket of goods used to calculate inflation. It remains to be seen how the purchase of Meantime by SAB Miller, which owns mass brands such as Foster\u2019s in Australia and Miller in the US, goes down with UK beer enthusiasts. Meantime\u2019s Miller said: \u201cWhy would Meantime suddenly not be a craft beer because it\u2019s got a different set of shareholders. Are we saying the shareholders determine whether we are craft or not? This morning, Alastair and I had no different values to the ones we had yesterday.\u201d But Richard Burhouse, founder and managing director of Huddersfield\u2019s Magic Rock brewery, said being owned by SAB Miller was at odds with the spirit of craft beer. \u201cAny credibility they had will be gone but I\u2019m not sure how much it will affect them because I think they\u2019ve been going into the mass market where customers are not so bothered. I don\u2019t begrudge Alastair doing this. He\u2019s been doing it [brewing at Meantime] a long time. Never say never but it\u2019s not on my mind at all that if we had an approach we would consider it.\u201d Craft ale has become difficult to define as its popularity has grown. The Campaign for Real Ale does not class Meantime\u2019s beers as real ale because they are served from a pressurised keg. Miller said top quality ingredients, character and lack of pasteurisation supported Meantime\u2019s craft status. Tom Stainer, Camra\u2019s head of communications, said: \u201cWhilst Meantime do not currently produce real ale, Camra are nonetheless concerned that choice for beer drinkers may be reduced following the acquisition of the brewery by SAB Miller, who may focus on a handful of core beers rather than a wide range. We would also urge the brewery to consider returning to brewing real ale in the future.\u201d The companies did not disclose the price SAB Miller will pay for Meantime. Meantime\u2019s chief executive said he, Hook and about 60 other investors, including some employees, owned the business. Miller and Hook will continue to run Meantime. They will receive funds to expand the Greenwich brewery and will also be in charge of a new product development facility to come up with new beers for SAB Miller.",

Miller said top quality ingredients, character and lack of pasteurisation supported Meantime\u2019s craft status.</p> <p>Tom Stainer, Camra\u2019s head of communications, said: \u201cWhilst Meantime do not currently produce real ale, Camra are nonetheless concerned that choice for beer drinkers may be reduced following the acquisition of the brewery by SAB Miller, who may focus on a handful of core beers rather than a wide range. We would also urge the brewery to consider returning to brewing real ale in the future.\u201d</p> <p>The companies did not disclose the price SAB Miller will pay for Meantime. Meantime\u2019s chief executive said he, Hook and about 60 other investors, including some employees, owned the business.<br></p> <p>Miller and Hook will continue to run Meantime. They will receive funds to expand the Greenwich brewery and will also be in charge of a new product development facility to come up with new beers for SAB Miller.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Ofcom plans to force BT to open up fibre-optic network", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ofcom has turned its guns on BT, with proposals to allow rival internet companies and mobile operators to install their own equipment on the telecoms group\u2019s fibre-optic cables. In a consultation paper on Friday, Ofcom said the changes - which are expected to come into effect in April 2017 - could lead to greater competition and falling prices for businesses and households. The communications regulator wants to overhaul access to the lines leased by businesses, libraries, universities and public bodies. It also wants to open up lines that broadband retailers use to carry web traffic over their own core networks, and open access to the cables leased by mobile operators to carry traffic from masts. The market for leased lines in the UK is worth \u00a32bn at the wholesale level, Ofcom estimates, with BT controlling a \u00a31.35bn slice. \u201cExpect BT to put up as much of a fight as possible,\u201d said Peter Ward of spread betting firm London Capital Group. \u201cOfcom\u2019s decision will be good news for rival providers and consumers alike, as BT\u2019s control of the underlying network has long been a source of frustration for them.\u201d Ofcom hopes its changes will prompt a business internet boom similar to the explosion in home broadband after operators were allowed to install their own equipment in BT exchanges. \u201cOur proposals are intended to allow BT to protect its investment by making a fair return, while boosting competition and innovation among different operators,\u201d Ofcom said. BT said the proposals could undermine investment in its network. Investors took the news in their stride \u2013 BT shares fell in morning trading before clawing back to a slight gain on the previous day\u2019s closing price. However, BT welcomed the suggestion that the new rules would not apply to lines inside London, where there are many competing providers. Ofcom has also suggested removing existing controls over BT\u2019s London cables, with no obligation to provide new access to its network to other internet firms. Competitors would get physical access to BT\u2019s fibre-optic cables under the proposals in the Business Connectivity Market Review. The concept is known as dark fibre, because the cables would not be \u201clit\u201d using BT\u2019s electronic equipment. Instead, they would be lit by the competitor installing its own equipment at either end of the cable. TalkTalk, Vodafone and other companies have been lobbying for the change. Being able to light the fibre themselves, they claim, would cut prices for their customers, reduce the time customers wait for a new line to be installed, and allow more variety in pricing and speed of internet connections. TalkTalk said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see that Ofcom is taking regulation of the business telecoms market seriously. For too long BT has been able to get away with delivering poor service to Britain\u2019s businesses at inflated prices and these recommendations will help drive competition into the commercial market and improve the service they receive.\u201d Ofcom also wants to reduce the time that customers wait for new lines to be installed over BT cables. Since 2011, the average time between a customer\u2019s order and the line being ready has increased from 40 to 46 working days. The first new quality of service rule would require Openreach, the BT division which builds and maintains its phone and broadband networks, to return this average to 40 working days from 2017. But Openreach cautioned: \u201cMandating dark fibre risks favouring a few companies that have the greatest capability to deploy it, to the disadvantage of all other firms. It will undermine investment \u2013 as a number of service providers have warned \u2013 and it would also increase costs, divert resources and add more complexity just when we\u2019re beginning to make progress on improving service.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Ofcom has turned its guns on BT, with proposals to allow rival internet companies and mobile operators to install their own equipment on the telecoms group\u2019s fibre-optic cables.</p> <p>In a consultation paper on Friday, Ofcom said the changes - which are expected to come into effect in April 2017 - could lead to greater competition and falling prices for businesses and households.</p> <p>The communications regulator wants to overhaul access to the lines leased by businesses, libraries, universities and public bodies. It also wants to open up lines that broadband retailers use to carry web traffic over their own core networks, and open access to the cables leased by mobile operators to carry traffic from masts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/14/talktalk-trial-york-internet-broadband\">TalkTalk to connect York to ultra-fast broadband</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The market for leased lines in the UK is worth \u00a32bn at the wholesale level, Ofcom estimates, with BT controlling a \u00a31.35bn slice. </p> <p>\u201cExpect BT to put up as much of a fight as possible,\u201d said Peter Ward of spread betting firm London Capital Group. \u201cOfcom\u2019s decision will be good news for rival providers and consumers alike, as BT\u2019s control of the underlying network has long been a source of frustration for them.\u201d</p> <p>Ofcom hopes its changes will prompt a business internet boom similar to the explosion in home broadband after operators were allowed to install their own equipment in BT exchanges.</p> <p>\u201cOur proposals are intended to allow BT to protect its investment by making a fair return, while boosting competition and innovation among different operators,\u201d Ofcom said. </p> <p>BT said the proposals could undermine investment in its network. Investors took the news in their stride \u2013 BT shares fell in morning trading before clawing back to a slight gain on the previous day\u2019s closing price. <br></p> <p>However, BT welcomed the suggestion that the new rules would not apply to lines inside London, where there are many competing providers. Ofcom has also suggested removing existing controls over BT\u2019s London cables, with no obligation to provide new access to its network to other internet firms.</p> <p>Competitors would get physical access to BT\u2019s fibre-optic cables under the proposals in the <a href=\"http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/bcmr-2015/?utm_source=updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=bcmr-may15\">Business Connectivity Market Review</a>. The concept is known as dark fibre, because the cables would not be \u201clit\u201d using BT\u2019s electronic equipment. Instead, they would be lit by the competitor installing its own equipment at either end of the cable.</p> <p>TalkTalk, Vodafone and other companies have been lobbying for the change. Being able to light the fibre themselves, they claim, would cut prices for their customers, reduce the time customers wait for a new line to be installed, and allow more variety in pricing and speed of internet connections.</p> <p>TalkTalk said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see that Ofcom is taking regulation of the business telecoms market seriously. For too long BT has been able to get away with delivering poor service to Britain\u2019s businesses at inflated prices and these recommendations will help drive competition into the commercial market and improve the service they receive.\u201d</p> <p>Ofcom also wants to reduce the time that customers wait for new lines to be installed over BT cables. Since 2011, the average time between a customer\u2019s order and the line being ready has increased from 40 to 46 working days. The first new quality of service rule would require Openreach, the BT division which builds and maintains its phone and broadband networks, to return this average to 40 working days from 2017.</p> <p>But Openreach cautioned: \u201cMandating dark fibre risks favouring a few companies that have the greatest capability to deploy it, to the disadvantage of all other firms. It will undermine investment \u2013 as a number of service providers have warned \u2013 and it would also increase costs, divert resources and add more complexity just when we\u2019re beginning to make progress on improving service.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Leading shares have made an optimistic start to the day, but are still heading for a weekly fall after a volatile few days.</p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is up 24.84 points at 6997.88, as European bonds recover some poise in the wake of European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi saying its QE programme would not end early. A record close on the S&amp;P 500 in the US has also helped sentiment.</p> <p>Greece however remains a concern for investors as time runs out for a deal to be done with its creditors to release much needed bailout funds.</p> <p>And US data is in focus, with manufacturing and confidence figures due later, as traders await clarity on when the Federal Reserve is likely to begin raising interest rates. After recent weak figures, including retail sales, analysts are suggesting an anticipated move in September to raise borrowing costs may be in doubt, which has helped weaken the dollar and support US markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The latest Empire manufacturing index for May is expected to show a rise to 4.75, from April\u2019s -1.2 reading, while industrial production for April is expected to show an improvement to 0% from March\u2019s 0.6% decline.</p> <p>Even allowing for a decent set of data today the prognosis for a September rate rise seems slim. Investors appear to have forgotten that the Fed cut its growth and inflation forecasts at the March meeting, after dropping \u201cpatience\u201d from the guidance language. </p> <p> Given that the next meeting is next month and in light of recent data it is unlikely that the Fed would upgrade those forecasts at its June meeting, given that we only have one more payrolls number between now and then.</p> <p> If we get a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach in June, which seems likely at the moment, then the earliest the Fed can act in revising its forecasts upwards would be September, and it would be unusual to do that ,and act on rates at the same meeting, which means the earliest we could get a move on rates now is either October, or December.</p> </blockquote> <p>Among the UK risers, <strong>Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling</strong> is up 35p to \u00a314.51 after the group issued an encouraging first quarter update, with volumes rising 7.2%. The rise came due to four extra selling days, the earlier Easter holiday and good performances in Nigeria and eastern Europe.</p> <p>Currency headwinds, which had unsettled investors, had a 5% adverse impact on sales, so net revenues grew 1.7%. The company said it had taken steps to mitigate emerging market exchange rates. Credit Suisse said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We raise our earnings per share estimates by around 10%, largely reflecting recent currency moves, in particular, the rouble. We believe this should support margin expansion in 2015. Our target price rises to \u00a314 (versus \u00a312.3).</p> <p>The group originally signalled at its full year results that it expected a \u20ac200m negative foreign exchange impact this year (translational and transactional). Given the rouble\u2019s rally since then this number should be around 25% lower we believe. We now model 50 basis points margin expansion (versus 10 basis points previously), noting that part of the foreign exchange savings will be offset by higher fuel costs and some re-investment - this drives our 10% earnings upgrades.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>ITV</strong> has recovered 4.3p to 261.6p following positive analyst comment on Thursday\u2019s update, with Bernstein raising its price target from 265p to 325p and JP Morgan lifting its target from 281p to 294p. Bernstein said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>ITV continues to be the most interesting free to air TV broadcaster in Europe both because of geography (the UK TV ad market continues to perform very well, reflecting the current strength of the UK economy) and because it has a larger and more successful TV production business than most continental broadcasters. ITV\u2019s investment into its production business, though volatile, can added to significant organic growth in the short to medium term and furthermore increases long-term sustainability in a world where content is king.</p> <p>The valuation remains inexpensive, and does not reflect a couple of less defined opportunities for upside (regulatory changes, M&amp;A), which we would not necessarily \u201cpay for\u201d but we believe are not reflected in the current share price. We rate ITV outperform with a target price of \u00a33.25. </p> </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps online gaming company <strong>Bwin Party.digita</strong>l is up 7.45p to 96.85p on hopes of a possible takeover. In March the company said it was closer to selling part or all of the business, while gaming firm GVC Holdings had reportedly expressed interest.</p>",

The FTSE 100 is up 24.84 points at 6997.88, as European bonds recover some poise in the wake of European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi saying its QE programme would not end early. A record close on the S&amp;P 500 in the US has also helped sentiment. Greece however remains a concern for investors as time runs out for a deal to be done with its creditors to release much needed bailout funds. And US data is in focus, with manufacturing and confidence figures due later, as traders await clarity on when the Federal Reserve is likely to begin raising interest rates. After recent weak figures, including retail sales, analysts are suggesting an anticipated move in September to raise borrowing costs may be in doubt, which has helped weaken the dollar and support US markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK said: The latest Empire manufacturing index for May is expected to show a rise to 4.75, from April\u2019s -1.2 reading, while industrial production for April is expected to show an improvement to 0% from March\u2019s 0.6% decline. Even allowing for a decent set of data today the prognosis for a September rate rise seems slim. Investors appear to have forgotten that the Fed cut its growth and inflation forecasts at the March meeting, after dropping \u201cpatience\u201d from the guidance language. Given that the next meeting is next month and in light of recent data it is unlikely that the Fed would upgrade those forecasts at its June meeting, given that we only have one more payrolls number between now and then. If we get a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach in June, which seems likely at the moment, then the earliest the Fed can act in revising its forecasts upwards would be September, and it would be unusual to do that ,and act on rates at the same meeting, which means the earliest we could get a move on rates now is either October, or December. Among the UK risers, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling is up 35p to \u00a314.51 after the group issued an encouraging first quarter update, with volumes rising 7.2%. The rise came due to four extra selling days, the earlier Easter holiday and good performances in Nigeria and eastern Europe. Currency headwinds, which had unsettled investors, had a 5% adverse impact on sales, so net revenues grew 1.7%. The company said it had taken steps to mitigate emerging market exchange rates. Credit Suisse said: We raise our earnings per share estimates by around 10%, largely reflecting recent currency moves, in particular, the rouble. We believe this should support margin expansion in 2015. Our target price rises to \u00a314 (versus \u00a312.3). The group originally signalled at its full year results that it expected a \u20ac200m negative foreign exchange impact this year (translational and transactional). Given the rouble\u2019s rally since then this number should be around 25% lower we believe. We now model 50 basis points margin expansion (versus 10 basis points previously), noting that part of the foreign exchange savings will be offset by higher fuel costs and some re-investment - this drives our 10% earnings upgrades. ITV has recovered 4.3p to 261.6p following positive analyst comment on Thursday\u2019s update, with Bernstein raising its price target from 265p to 325p and JP Morgan lifting its target from 281p to 294p. Bernstein said: ITV continues to be the most interesting free to air TV broadcaster in Europe both because of geography (the UK TV ad market continues to perform very well, reflecting the current strength of the UK economy) and because it has a larger and more successful TV production business than most continental broadcasters. ITV\u2019s investment into its production business, though volatile, can added to significant organic growth in the short to medium term and furthermore increases long-term sustainability in a world where content is king. The valuation remains inexpensive, and does not reflect a couple of less defined opportunities for upside (regulatory changes, M&amp;A), which we would not necessarily \u201cpay for\u201d but we believe are not reflected in the current share price. We rate ITV outperform with a target price of \u00a33.25. Among the mid-caps online gaming company Bwin Party.digital is up 7.45p to 96.85p on hopes of a possible takeover. In March the company said it was closer to selling part or all of the business, while gaming firm GVC Holdings had reportedly expressed interest.",
