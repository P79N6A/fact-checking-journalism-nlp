Nearly 70% of the growth in turnover in the past year came from food retailing and from cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services. Given they only comprise around 50% of the retail sector, that suggests other areas are still sluggish. One area that is not at all sluggish, however, is the building sector. In January private sector building approvals grew annually by 29.5% in trend terms. That is the highest such growth since April 2010, when building approvals skyrocketed due to the stimulus measures during the GFC, which included a doubling of the first-home buyers grant. Excluding the stimulus period it is the biggest annual growth in total building approvals since May 2002. And best of all it is no flash in the pan.

That was the longest run of falling approvals since the ABS began measuring them in 1983. This has nicely led to the biggest annual increase in construction jobs since 2008: This increase in housing construction has also coincided with a significant increase in housing prices. Last year housing prices across the country grew by 9.5% on average. Only Canberra among all 8 capital cities failed to see a rise in housing prices. While that is good for homeowners and investors, for those looking to get into the market it\u2019s less of a happy situation. Yesterday\u2019s housing finance figures showed first homebuyers now make up a mere 13.7% of the housing market: While there have been good signs on the construction employment front, it\u2019s tougher to find positive jobs news elsewhere. But there are some small crumbs of positivity to cling to. The monthly ANZ job advertisements survey is a good leading indicator that lets us know if firms are looking to hire people. In February it showed a massive 5.0% spike in seasonally adjusted terms compared with January.

The department\u2019s March update of the leading indicator was released yesterday showing the 23rd straight negative result. At best we can say the rate of decline is slowing, so things may perhaps be starting to turn around rather than progressively get worse. Let\u2019s end with some even more upbeat news. The latest national accounts figures showed that company profits are rising \u2013 up 9.5% in 2013, the best annual rise since 2011 and nicely above the 10-year average rise of 7.5% As the indicators on employment have shown, it is still too early to see this translating into more jobs, but it sure is a better picture than occurred in 2012, when profits in some industries, such as mining, fell by 26%. The profit increase, combined with a surge in exports of 15% in the past year, suggests that maybe there are signs that business is looking up. While business confidence in February fell slightly from January, it remains above trend. But just when we may be able to adopt that happy outlook, we hear that China\u2019s manufacturing activity is declining, and so too are its exports, and as a result iron ore prices have plunged this month. So while there are some positive signs, the situation remains pretty fragile, and try as we might it could be a while before we can turn that economic frown upside down.",

As the person who took nine years to find an acceptable political, business and employee solution to the privatisation of public transport in South Yorkshire in the 1980s and 90s, I can't help but feel the Co-op has done the right thing to say goodbye to Mr Sutherland. Of course it isn't easy to find solutions in complex organisations where democracy rules, but that's what management is paid for. If my management team and our union colleagues could find a middle road between socialist South Yorkshire and a Thatcherite Tory government, it is disappointing that Mr Sutherland could not do something similar for the Coop.

As practical people, co-operators will find a good, timely solution to balancing efficiency and democracy, but we need to avoid being stampeded into arrangements that the society may subsequently regret. David Smith Newport \u2022 On the day Co-op Group chief executive Euan Sutherland resigned and Bob Crow sadly died, I was reminded of the bad old days when unions were blamed for all the ills of British industry, when the problem was in fact weak management. As the person who took nine years to find an acceptable political, business and employee solution to the privatisation of public transport in South Yorkshire in the 1980s and 90s, I can't help but feel the Co-op has done the right thing to say goodbye to Mr Sutherland. Of course it isn't easy to find solutions in complex organisations where democracy rules, but that's what management is paid for. If my management team and our union colleagues could find a middle road between socialist South Yorkshire and a Thatcherite Tory government, it is disappointing that Mr Sutherland could not do something similar for the Coop. Is that an indication of the inability of some managers to tackle big challenges, rather than an indictment of the Coop? Peter Sephton Sheffield \u2022 When I applied to become a member of the Co-op I ticked a box that affirmed: \"I support co-operative values and principles.\" Did those people now running the organisation do the same? I certainly don't remember ticking a box that said: \"I support the aims and objectives of unfettered greed.\" Bill Packford Penzance, Cornwall",

That is where Morrisons stands. Chief executive Dalton Philips has staked his credibility on the idea that hitting Aldi and Lidl where it hurts will not interrupt the flow of dividends to shareholders. Not everybody is convinced. \"We do not expect a dividend increase to materialise,\" says JP Morgan's analyst. Scepticism is understandable. The problem with cutting prices as an \"investment\" is that you can never really know how much will be enough to reverse a decline in sales. Morrisons has run its financial models for the past year, which is why it could talk to a script in which lower prices lead to higher sales, which in turn produces strong cash flows when coupled with an attack on costs. The worry, though, is that the magic sauce \u2013 \u00a31bn of price cuts over three years \u2013 won't look so potent once Tesco and Asda, and even Sainsbury's, have reacted. The discounters will also respond. Their first hurrah in the 1990s was slowed by strong price moves by Asda and Tesco but these days they are bigger businesses with more stores and as many as 2,000 products in their ranges. As the old order launches its counter-attack, Aldi and Lidl will not stand still. Yet Morrisons had to choose its poison and Philips has made a sensible move. The business could not carry on leaking market share. More shoppers are shopping on price and Morrisons had to remember its roots. It should probably have done so sooner. When Philips became chief executive four years ago, Morrisons had no convenience stores and had ignored online retailing. Those faults had to be corrected as a priority, but Philips took a baffling excursion before concluding that Ocado was the best provider of Morrisons' online food offer. Buying Kiddicare, an online retailer of children's clothes, was meant to teach Morrisons about the home delivery of groceries. Really? It was even more eccentric to open 10 Kiddicare shops. The result is a \u00a3163m writedown among \u00a3903m of property-related hits. At 205p, down 12%, the yield on Morrisons' shares is 6.3% \u2013 that's if you believe the dividend can be held aloft as the business wrestles in the mud with Aldi and Lidl.

    "webTitle": "Bank bonuses could be clawed back up to six years later under proposed rules", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Banks will be forced to change senior executives' contracts so that their bonuses can be clawed back up to six years after they have been paid out, under proposals announced by the Bank of England. The proposed rule is set to take effect at the start of next year and would allow payouts to be reclaimed if evidence emerged of \"misbehaviour or material error\", major financial problems or failures of risk management. Current rules allow only for the cancellation or reduction of parts of bonuses that have been awarded but not yet paid. The Bank's Prudential Regulation Authority has given banks, insurers and big investment firms two months to comment on its plans, which could cover bonuses awarded before 1 January this year but not yet paid. Andrew Bailey, the head of the PRA, said: \"The policy we are consulting on will ensure bonuses can be clawed back from individuals, where they have already been paid, if it becomes apparent they have put the stability of their firms at risk or engaged in inappropriate actions. This will provide a clear message to individuals of what is expected from them and the consequences of not acting properly.\" Clawbacks will not only be applied to staff directly involved in misconduct, but also to those who could have been \"reasonably expected\" to be aware of the failure or misconduct at the time and failed to take action. If there is major misconduct or failure of risk management, top executives not directly responsible for the decisions but who set strategy and culture will be held responsible. The rule means bank bosses who preside over mis-selling such as the \u00a320bn payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal could have their bonuses reclaimed. Last year, Lloyds Banking Group cut former chief executive Eric Daniels' 2010 bonus to \u00a3300,000 from \u00a31.45m because of PPI mis-selling and cut other former directors' payouts. But the bank did so before the payment, due in 2013, was made. Andrew Tyrie, who chaired parliament's banking commission, said the PRA's proposal was the first step in the adoption of his commission's recommendations. \"Ill-designed remuneration packages have rewarded misconduct and added risk to balance sheets. Clawback of vested bonuses can help drive up standards. It can also help ensure that those responsible do not keep rewards for failure,\" Tyrie said. The financial crisis drew attention to bonuses paid by banks to top managers and traders for actions that later proved disastrous. Fred Goodwin, the former Royal Bank of Scotland boss, was paid millions of pounds for decisions, such as the takeover of ABN Amro, that took the bank to the brink of collapse. Other chief executives who became rich before their banks nearly imploded included Northern Rock's Adam Applegarth and James Crosby of HBOS. Senior traders at investment banks also walked off with millions in cash bonuses before it became clear that they had landed their companies with toxic assets. The Bank of England said it had delegated power from parliament that would make the new rule work. But Jill Andrew, a partner at law firm Beam Law, said the proposal could be challenged by bankers and their lawyers. \"If a banker came to me and said: 'They want to change my contract' I would tell them to say: 'No thank you.' Or they can go and work in Frankfurt, New York or Hong Kong. \"Also, the bonus becomes moribund as an incentive. Bankers don't tuck their bonuses away as a nest egg; they use them to make capital purchases like a house.\" Sharon Bowles, who chairs the European parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee, said the PRA's proposal was welcome but overdue. \"One of the major complaints from the UK to us was that they didn't want contracts of employment amended, so it's quite amusing. They don't like doing it when Europe tells them to do it but they don't mind doing it when they tell themselves.\" The British Bankers' Association said it was right that bonuses should be returned if performance or conduct turned out to be bad but it said putting the plan into practice wouldn't be easy.",

But its flawed structure and working methods hindered national \u201cownership\u201d and compromised transparency and accountability, says a resolution on the EP inquiry findings. A second resolution deplores the widespread negative impacts that Troika-inspired reforms had on employment and advocates revising the measures put in place.</p> <p>Both resolutions were voted on Thursday. The one on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee\u2019s inquiry into the workings of the Troika, drafted by Othmar Karas (EPP, AT) and Liem Hoang-Ngoc (S&amp;D, FR), was approved by 448 votes to 140, with 27 abstentions. The Employment and Social Affairs Committee\u2019s resolution, authored by Alejandro Cercas (S&amp;D, ES) was approved by 408 votes to 135, with 63 abstentions.</p> <p>The Troika system is... criticised for taking a \u201cone-size fits all\u201d approach from which it was often reluctant to depart.</p> <p>EU finance ministers, particularly in the Eurogroup, are blamed for failing to give clear and consistent political pointers to the Commission and for failing to shoulder their share of responsibility in their capacity as final decision-taker.</p> <p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p> <p>As a first step, there should be clear, transparent and binding rules of procedure for the interaction of the Troika institutions which regulate the allocation of tasks between them. An improved communication strategy is also an \u201cutmost priority\u201d, says the Economic Affairs Committee text.</p> <p>For the medium term, the inquiry resolution recommends a radical overhaul of the troika, in which IMF involvement would become \u201coptional\u201d, the ECB would be present only as a \u201csilent observer\u201d, and the European Commission\u2019s role would be taken over by a \u201cEuropean Monetary Fund\u201d (EMF).</p> <p>The second resolution calls on the Commission and the Council to give the same attention to social imbalances as to macroeconomic ones. Member states and the EU should put in place a job recovery plan once the worst of the financial crisis has passed, taking particular account of the need to create favourable conditions for small firms, for instance by repairing the credit system.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/euobs/statuses/444103091508740096\">

class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with <b>Morrisons</b> for a moment, and after <a

management and the City. Analyst Louise Cooper said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That was a brutal 90 minutes for Morrison\u2019s executive team. I can\u2019t think of one question from City analysts that didn\u2019t include significant criticism. The harshest? \u201cDo you think you\u2019re creating the price conditions where Asda and Tesco will choose to crush you\u201d. But also there were concerns that Morrison\u2019s profits will not recover sufficiently to pay the increases in dividend, and worries about Morrison\u2019s breaching debt covenants as profit falls. I imagine CEO Dalton Philips and CFO Trevor Strain wanted it to be over as soon as it began.</p> <p> But there is plenty to criticise. The strategic decisions at the company have been appallingly bad. At some stage it will be a Harvard case study as to how not to run a business. I\u2019ve already noted the weakness in online \u2013 only launched 9 weeks ago - convenience stores \u2013 100 so far compared to Tesco which has around 1700 Tesco Express and Metro \u2013 and a lack of a significant own brand value range \u2013 essential for austerity Britain. But there are more dire decisions. Kiddicare was bought in 2011 for two reasons: to enable Morrison\u2019s to build an online business and to get closer to \u201cyoung families\u201d. Thanks to the deal with Ocado, the first reason became superfluous. And Morrison\u2019s should have been close to its customers already, but hasn\u2019t been due to the absence of a loyalty card (which it is launching this year). Morrison\u2019s admitted it had been crushed at Christmas because the big three supermarket competitors had used targeted price promotions so effectively thanks to the data from their loyalty schemes. Trading at Kiddicare has been disappointing and it will cost at least \u00a3100mn this year to exit.</p> <p>The real long term threat is not Tesco, Asda or Sainsbury\u2019s (although they could do a lot of damage in the short term) but the discounters, Aldi and Lidl. So far I do not think that Tesco or Morrison\u2019s have really got to grips with the scale of the competitive threat they offer, even if they have taken over \u00a34bn of sales off the big four in just three years. </p> <p>The big four are still lagging behind the changing market conditions. Morrison\u2019s is only just catching up with the developments of five to ten years ago \u2013 online, loyalty card, convenience etc \u2013 let alone the changes happening now. And there seems little urgency. Morrison\u2019s is still building out new stores for the next two years, until the end of 2015/6. Although to be fair it says it is committed financially to these openings and thereafter will only open new large stores in exceptional circumstances. </p> <p>To me the problems that Morrison have were best summed up when Dalton Philips said \u201cwe currently don\u2019t know our customers well enough\u201d. That is an extraordinary admission. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5321adaee4b086597fcec3db\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-13T13:13:26.261Z\">1.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>US futures are showing a 32 point rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average when Wall Street opens shortly</b> (the US put their clocks ahead an hour over the weekend so the market opens at 13.30 UK time), after the better than expected retail sales and jobless claims numbers. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US retail sales surprised on the upside in February, up by a stronger than expected 0.3% from a downward revised -0.6% the prior month. The outcome is more robust than anticipated and it shows encouraging signs for retail activity that managed to improve despite adverse weather conditions.<br> </p> <p> In a nutshell, the picture for retail activity doesn\u2019t look to bad in February after two consecutive declines. Looking ahead, we expect further modest increases in retail activity, given the relatively stable picture described by consumer confidence and a relative improvement in the labour market.</p> <p>As for the latter, signs of some consolidation emerged by today\u2019s initial weekly jobless claims that fell to 315,000 the week ended March 8 vs 324,000 the prior week. After a few weeks of extreme volatility due to a series of one-off factors, weekly jobless claims seem to have regained the downward trend consistent with the slow improvement in the labour market seen in the second half of 2013.<br>  As we highlighted in our preview earlier today, we expect the Fed to continue its tapering at next week\u2019s FOMC meeting. Today\u2019s data consolidate the idea that the effects of adverse weather are just temporary and some normalization of the moderate recovery should re-emerge late in the first quarter and early second quarter.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5321ad1fe4b0e607c9e4d683\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-13T13:06:09.230Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Time to hand over the baton to Nick Fletcher.

Investors seem to have taken heart from Premier Li\u2019s comments on the more pressing issue of debt, pledging to contain any systematic risk and noting that the 7.5% growth target does have some flexibility, which would make other recent targets more feasible.</p> <p>As for the Ukraine, we seem to be getting nowhere fast and the increased involvement of the US is escalating the issue, while Russia shows no intention to stand down. In fact today\u2019s reports that Russian officials are readying for \u201cIran style\u201d sanctions from the west shows just how far they are willing to go. The escalation has done little to help the markets and gold continues to benefit from the risk-off sentiment. <br></p> </blockquote> <p>The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said this morning that it had suspended talks with Russia related to its accession to the organisation following a request from its members.

At least Morrison\u2019s plan to focus on the core business and improve cash flow, helped by some property sales, but management will get a grilling at the analysts meeting in the City at 9.30am</p> </blockquote> <p>Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In drawing a strategic line in the sand, Morrisons is attempting to close the widening gap with its rivals. The discount supermarkets have become a thorn in the side for the bigger players, and Morrison\u2019s lack of a properly established online or convenience store offering has seen its progress limited over recent times. The company has now decided that it is time to revitalise the business, which will inevitably come at a cost. Indeed, the outlook for next year is significantly lower and, whilst the new strategy is being implemented, the fiercely competitive supermarket sector will move on apace.<br>  Not all is doom and gloom within the numbers. The online and convenience store presence has at least now started, significant cost savings have been identified and, from an investment perspective, the current dividend yield of 4.7% will be boosted by another hike which reflects a continuation of the progressive policy.  However, this sharp change of direction will require time and patience, which have been in short supply from investors. Even prior to today\u2019s tumble, the shares had fallen 23% over the last six months alone, as compared to a 1% hike for the wider FTSE100. Opinion remains divided over prospects for this beleaguered company, and the market consensus of the shares as a hold may well remain in place for now.</p> </blockquote> <p>Phil Dorrell, director of consultancy Retail Remedy, who used to manage stores himself, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Is there anything left to lose? Morrisons is now emitting serious warning signs and this is the position it has been in for over a year.<br> What\u2019s going wrong? Morrisons has an estate that lacks any format excitement, uninspired marketing, sharp competitors in Aldi and Lidl, and, to top it all off, zero sense of direction. It feels as dated as it does rudderless. It\u2019s playing catch-up in all areas of its business, from online to convenience. Dalton Philips is an experienced retailer but has failed to deliver a clear and robust strategy. The truth is that the main portfolio has simply not moved on in the four years he has been there. In the meantime, Aldi, Lidl and Waitrose are gorging themselves on his market share. Morrisons has even lost ground to the discounters on fresh foods. As an old-school grocer, the one thing Morrisons can do is run stores with discipline and standards but morale is eroding in the glaring absence of inspired leadership.  The Kiddicare venture rapidly proved a mistake and simply delivered even more poorly formatted stores with an indistinct proposition. Kiddicare is now being kicked ignominiously into the long grass. Selling a percentage of the freeholds is a means to keep some share price dignity but means nothing without a clearly defined statement of intent and a strategy to make it all happen.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-104d99c3-4780-486b-a69e-0511559d7580\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394700060103/d0f6de5f-563b-4dc6-afa9-afc5eee0c48c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A profit warning sent shockwaves through the industry today.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A profit warning sent shockwaves through the industry today.

China\u2019s industrial production rose 8.6% in the first two months from a year earlier, disappointing market expectations of a 9.5% increase. This marked the worst performance since April 2009 (and was partly down to strikes and industrial unrest in Chinese factories).<br></p> <p>Consumer spending also appears to be running out of steam.

European markets have dropped sharply on a combination of worries, notably a slowdown in China, signs the US Federal Reserve may well authorise further trimming of its bond buying programme next week, and the continuing tensions in Ukraine ahead of a planned referendum in Crimea on Sunday. The falls showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 dropped 67.12 points or 1.01% to a five week low of 6553.78 \u2022 Germany\u2019s Dax was down 1.86% to 9017.79 \u2022 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.29% lower at 4250.51 \u2022 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB ended 0.91% down at 20,591.82 \u2022 Spain\u2019s Ibex lost 1.19% to 9950.3 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 165 points or 1%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Moody\u2019s has downgraded Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s long-term debt and deposit ratings to Baa1 from A3, with a negative outlook. The long term ratings of the holding company have been downgraded from Baa1 to Baa2. The agency said: This rating action concludes Moody\u2019s review for downgrade announced on 12 February, prompted by the bank\u2019s announcement that its capital position at end-2013 would be weaker than previously indicated. The negative outlook.. reflects (1) the uncertainties related to the execution of the complex group restructuring and (2) the risk that factors beyond the control of its management could challenge the execution of this plan. Markets are continuing to slide, on a combination of a possible slowdown in China, further tapering of its bond buying programme by the US Federal Reserve, and continuing tensions in Ukraine. And under such circumstances, unsubstantiated rumours tend to go round the markets like wildfire, to whit: The US Federal Reserve is on its way to ending its stimulus measures to support the economy and the reduction in its bond buying programme will continue, according to vice chair nominee Stanley Fischer. Speaking to a senate banking committee, Fischer said (according to Reuters): I think the exit is beginning, or has begun. The extent of the purchases of the Fed, the monthly amount that is being purchased, is being reduced, and conditions for the continuation of that have been described. The comments have helped push the US market into negative territory, with investors remaining nervous about the prospect of the Fed\u2019s wall of money being taken away. The Fed of course is well aware of this: The troika of lenders - the EU, European Central Bank and IMF - helped four countries through the financial crisis but had a flawed structure and a negative impact on employment, according to the European Parliament. After a vote on two resolutions on the troika, a European Parliament statement said: [The troika] helped four EU countries through the crisis and prevented it from getting worse. But its flawed structure and working methods hindered national \u201cownership\u201d and compromised transparency and accountability, says a resolution on the EP inquiry findings. A second resolution deplores the widespread negative impacts that Troika-inspired reforms had on employment and advocates revising the measures put in place. Both resolutions were voted on Thursday. The one on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee\u2019s inquiry into the workings of the Troika, drafted by Othmar Karas (EPP, AT) and Liem Hoang-Ngoc (S&amp;D, FR), was approved by 448 votes to 140, with 27 abstentions. The Employment and Social Affairs Committee\u2019s resolution, authored by Alejandro Cercas (S&amp;D, ES) was approved by 408 votes to 135, with 63 abstentions. The Troika system is... criticised for taking a \u201cone-size fits all\u201d approach from which it was often reluctant to depart. EU finance ministers, particularly in the Eurogroup, are blamed for failing to give clear and consistent political pointers to the Commission and for failing to shoulder their share of responsibility in their capacity as final decision-taker. Recommendations As a first step, there should be clear, transparent and binding rules of procedure for the interaction of the Troika institutions which regulate the allocation of tasks between them. An improved communication strategy is also an \u201cutmost priority\u201d, says the Economic Affairs Committee text. For the medium term, the inquiry resolution recommends a radical overhaul of the troika, in which IMF involvement would become \u201coptional\u201d, the ECB would be present only as a \u201csilent observer\u201d, and the European Commission\u2019s role would be taken over by a \u201cEuropean Monetary Fund\u201d (EMF). The second resolution calls on the Commission and the Council to give the same attention to social imbalances as to macroeconomic ones. Member states and the EU should put in place a job recovery plan once the worst of the financial crisis has passed, taking particular account of the need to create favourable conditions for small firms, for instance by repairing the credit system. After half an hour or so of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 29 points, much in line with futures number. Elsewhere Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac are both up slightly, while the FTSE 100 is lagging a little, down aroune 15 points. More embarrassment for Morrisons: it has had to restate a couple of figures in its results release: The following amendments have been made to the \u2018Final Results\u2019 announcement released on 13th March 2014 at 07:00 under RNS No 2092C. Put the dividend number to two decimal places in the Financial Summary and the Chairman\u2019s section to align with the financial statements (changed from 9.2p to 9.16p) Clarified footnote 4 to be underlying profit before tax (previously underlying earnings) Under section \u2018Accelerating our presence in new channels\u2019 subheading \u2018Convenience\u2019 the annualised sales from convenience figure now reads as around \u00a3350m (previously \u00a3400m) All other details remain unchanged. So no restatement of the profit warning then.... Here\u2019s a (belated) summary so far: \u2022 Morrisons has seen its shares slump after the supermarket group unveiled a profit warning \u2022 Royal Dutch Shell is cutting expenditure in the US by a fifth this year after losses in shale \u2022 After more poor Chinese data, premier Li Keqiang has warned of severe challenges to the country\u2019s economy and said further bond defaults were \u201cunavoidable\u201d \u2022 In Britain the number of mortgages granted to first time buyers rose by 38% in January \u2022 The annual changes to the UK\u2019s shopping basket used to calculate inflation show Netflix and flavoured milk are in, DVD recorders and hardwood flooring are out \u2022 Ireland successfully auctioned \u20ac1bn of 10 year bonds ... \u2022 ....but its economy unexpectedly shrank in the fourth quarter \u2022 The euro hit a fresh high for the year against the pound \u2022 US retail sales and weekly jobless claims both cheered investors Back with Morrisons for a moment, and after the profit warning, a difficult discussion between the management and the City. Analyst Louise Cooper said: That was a brutal 90 minutes for Morrison\u2019s executive team. I can\u2019t think of one question from City analysts that didn\u2019t include significant criticism. The harshest? \u201cDo you think you\u2019re creating the price conditions where Asda and Tesco will choose to crush you\u201d. But also there were concerns that Morrison\u2019s profits will not recover sufficiently to pay the increases in dividend, and worries about Morrison\u2019s breaching debt covenants as profit falls. I imagine CEO Dalton Philips and CFO Trevor Strain wanted it to be over as soon as it began. But there is plenty to criticise. The strategic decisions at the company have been appallingly bad. At some stage it will be a Harvard case study as to how not to run a business. I\u2019ve already noted the weakness in online \u2013 only launched 9 weeks ago - convenience stores \u2013 100 so far compared to Tesco which has around 1700 Tesco Express and Metro \u2013 and a lack of a significant own brand value range \u2013 essential for austerity Britain. But there are more dire decisions. Kiddicare was bought in 2011 for two reasons: to enable Morrison\u2019s to build an online business and to get closer to \u201cyoung families\u201d. Thanks to the deal with Ocado, the first reason became superfluous. And Morrison\u2019s should have been close to its customers already, but hasn\u2019t been due to the absence of a loyalty card (which it is launching this year). Morrison\u2019s admitted it had been crushed at Christmas because the big three supermarket competitors had used targeted price promotions so effectively thanks to the data from their loyalty schemes. Trading at Kiddicare has been disappointing and it will cost at least \u00a3100mn this year to exit. The real long term threat is not Tesco, Asda or Sainsbury\u2019s (although they could do a lot of damage in the short term) but the discounters, Aldi and Lidl. So far I do not think that Tesco or Morrison\u2019s have really got to grips with the scale of the competitive threat they offer, even if they have taken over \u00a34bn of sales off the big four in just three years. The big four are still lagging behind the changing market conditions. Morrison\u2019s is only just catching up with the developments of five to ten years ago \u2013 online, loyalty card, convenience etc \u2013 let alone the changes happening now. And there seems little urgency. Morrison\u2019s is still building out new stores for the next two years, until the end of 2015/6. Although to be fair it says it is committed financially to these openings and thereafter will only open new large stores in exceptional circumstances. To me the problems that Morrison have were best summed up when Dalton Philips said \u201cwe currently don\u2019t know our customers well enough\u201d. That is an extraordinary admission. US futures are showing a 32 point rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average when Wall Street opens shortly (the US put their clocks ahead an hour over the weekend so the market opens at 13.30 UK time), after the better than expected retail sales and jobless claims numbers. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: US retail sales surprised on the upside in February, up by a stronger than expected 0.3% from a downward revised -0.6% the prior month. The outcome is more robust than anticipated and it shows encouraging signs for retail activity that managed to improve despite adverse weather conditions. In a nutshell, the picture for retail activity doesn\u2019t look to bad in February after two consecutive declines. Looking ahead, we expect further modest increases in retail activity, given the relatively stable picture described by consumer confidence and a relative improvement in the labour market. As for the latter, signs of some consolidation emerged by today\u2019s initial weekly jobless claims that fell to 315,000 the week ended March 8 vs 324,000 the prior week. After a few weeks of extreme volatility due to a series of one-off factors, weekly jobless claims seem to have regained the downward trend consistent with the slow improvement in the labour market seen in the second half of 2013. As we highlighted in our preview earlier today, we expect the Fed to continue its tapering at next week\u2019s FOMC meeting. Today\u2019s data consolidate the idea that the effects of adverse weather are just temporary and some normalization of the moderate recovery should re-emerge late in the first quarter and early second quarter. Time to hand over the baton to Nick Fletcher. Thanks for all your comments. Italy also got its auction away, selling the maximum targeted \u2013 \u20ac7.75bn of bonds \u2013 this morning. There was more good news as the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a three-month low last week. Jobless claims dropped 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 315,000, the Labor Department said today \u2013 the lowest reading since late November. US import prices rose more than expected, posting their biggest rise in a year in February (up 0.9%), as petroleum jumped but there was little evidence of a broad pick-up in imported inflation. US data just in: Retail sales rose slightly more than expected last month, by 0.3%, ending two months of declines. Shoppers stayed at home during unusually cold weather with masses of snow at the turn of the year. Sales are expected to pick up further in coming months as warmer temperatures and better household finances lure consumers back into the shops. After the successful bond auction this morning, some shock news from Ireland: the economy unexpectedly shrank in the fourth quarter from the previous three months, by 2.3%. Imports surged and consumer spending declined. Economists had expected growth of 0.4%. Over 2013 as a whole, the economy contracted by 0.3%, wrongfooting analysts who had expected growth of the same magnitude. Gold has hit six-month highs, rising above $1,370 an ounce today and extending yesterday\u2019s rally. Investors spooked by the Ukraine crisis are piling into bullion, which is generally regarded as a safe haven in times of turmoil. Closer to home, there is more evidence today of how uneven and sluggish the economic recovery in northern Ireland. Three hundred jobs have been lost at the Driver and Vehicle Agency based in Coleraine, Co.Derry, it was announced this morning. The Guardian\u2019s Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald has sent us this: The move is a typical one in the age of Coalition austerity - part of centralising the DVA\u2019s work at its Swansea HQ yet with no creation/transter of any new jobs in the Welsh base. Stormont environment minister Mark H Durkan has described the job losses as a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d. He said staff would feel \u201ccompletely betrayed\u201d by the decision. \u201cThis is purely a narrowly focussed cost-cutting exercise made with no regard whatsoever for standards of service, the impact on customers, or the wider impact on the economy of Northern Ireland and, in particular, of Coleraine,\u201d he said. The job losses in the northwest region of Northern Ireland were revealed on the day an Ulster Bank report found that overall business activity is on the rise again in the province. Ulster Bank\u2019s Purchasing Managers Index found that manufacturing, construction, retail and services \u2013 registered growth of activity in February, with retail leading the way. The bank\u2019s chief economist Richard Ramsey said: \u201cNorthern Ireland\u2019s private sector firms have now reported an increase in business activity, employment and export orders for eight consecutive months. Meanwhile the level of new orders rose in February for the ninth month in a row.\u201d Meanwhile Belfast City Centre Management group has reported that a sharp rise in consumer foot fall since the start of the year. Two surveys of more than 200 shops and retail outlets in the city centre report that from December 2013 there has been a 5.7 per cent increase in sales compared to the rest of last year. Yet in some parts of the city centre, most notably the northern end of Belfast\u2019s most famous shopping thoroughfare, Royal Avenue, there are still plenty of empty shops and business premises. More comments from China\u2019s premier Li Keqiang at his annual media conference earlier. He said further defaults of bonds and and other financial products are \u201cunavoidable\u201d as financial deregulation gets under way in the country \u2013 but the government will intervene to ensure this does not endanger the wider financial system. Last week Chaori Solar, a Shanghai-based solar panel maker, became the first Chinese company to default on its domestic bonds when it failed to pay interest on 1bn renminbi of bonds. The euro has hit a fresh high for this year against the pound, extending its post-ECB rally. It touched 83.78p, and has climbed nearly 2% since the European Central Bank left interest rates on hold and did not introduce new measures a week ago \u2013 despite forecasting low inflation for years to come which would give it room to act. ECB president Mario Draghi said the euro\u2019s rise was having little impact on imported inflation in the eurozone. The Footsie has lost some 4 points to 6616.68, while Germany\u2019s Dax is up nearly 30 points at 9217.73, a 0.3% gain, and France\u2019s CAC is almost 10 points, or 0.2%, ahead at 4315.67. Toby Morris, senior sales trader at CMC Markets, has looked at the mood in markets. UK markets have drifted marginally lower this morning after investors weighed up news from Ukraine and China, while corporate updates were mixed. Chinese industrial output data missed expectations overnight, but given the recent move lower a slowdown in China is probably largely priced in already and the session actually saw equities higher on the closing bell. Investors seem to have taken heart from Premier Li\u2019s comments on the more pressing issue of debt, pledging to contain any systematic risk and noting that the 7.5% growth target does have some flexibility, which would make other recent targets more feasible. As for the Ukraine, we seem to be getting nowhere fast and the increased involvement of the US is escalating the issue, while Russia shows no intention to stand down. In fact today\u2019s reports that Russian officials are readying for \u201cIran style\u201d sanctions from the west shows just how far they are willing to go. The escalation has done little to help the markets and gold continues to benefit from the risk-off sentiment. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said this morning that it had suspended talks with Russia related to its accession to the organisation following a request from its members. At the same time, its members agreed to strengthen cooperation with Ukraine. Irish debt sale results just in: Ireland has got the auction of \u20ac1bn of 10-year bonds safely away, with yields averaging 2.967%. It\u2019s the country\u2019s first regular debt auction since its bailout. The auction received 2.9 times more bids than needed for its completion. One bond trader described it as a \u201cstellar auction\u201d. Every year, Office for National Statistics updates the shopping basket of goods and services used to calculate inflation. This year, video streaming services such as Netflix, flavoured milk, mixer drinks, fruit snack pots and honey have been added. Also in: men\u2019s clothing hire, canvas shoes and necklaces. Digital cameras with interchangeable lenses (such as DSLR cameras) are also being added. Hardwood flooring, on the other hand, has been removed from the basket, as spending on this has fallen in recent years. DVD recorders are also out. The ONS is trying to keep up with new trends and changes in consumer spending, to accurately measure inflation in the UK. For a full list of all the items added and removed from the basket click here. In Britain, the number of mortgages granted to first-time buyers climbed 38% in January from a year ago, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Between December and January, there was the usual seasonal dip. The total number of loans for house purchase in January was down 16% compared to December, but up 30% on January 2013. Irish government bond yields have fallen to fresh record lows before Dublin\u2019s first regular debt auction since its bailout more than three years ago. Ireland is returning to market today with the sale of \u20ac1bn of 10-year bonds. Demand for Irish bonds has been strong this year from a broad range of investors, including pension funds and insurers who tend to invest for the long term. Bond yields have fallen below 3% \u2013 compared with a peak of more than 15% in 2011, according to Reuters data. Italy is also selling debt today \u2013 up to \u20ac7.75bn of bonds maturing in 2016, 2021, 2028 and 2037. Italian ten-year yields edged lower to 3.41%. This compares with 1.59% for German 10-year Bund yields, the benchmark for eurozone borrowing costs. Returning to the subject of China\u2019s slowdown, the country\u2019s premier Li Keqiang has warned that the economy faces \u201csevere challenges\u201d this year. The comments came after a triple dose of weak data that suggest the economy is running out of steam. Li hinted Beijing would tolerate slower growth while it pushes through reforms aimed at providing more sustainable expansion in the long run. The disappointing figures fuelled expectations that the central bank would relax monetary policy to support growth. Gao Yuan, analyst at Haiton Securities in Shanghai, said: A storm is coming. The FTSE 100 index has dropped some 8 points, or 0.1%, to 6612.22. Germany\u2019s Dax has edged some 11 points higher, or 0.1%, to 9199.89, while France\u2019s CAC is up 2.7 points, or 0.06%, at 4308.99. In other corporate news, Royal Dutch Shell is cutting spending on American exploration by a fifth this year after losses in shale. In a strategy update, the oil giant said: Shell is shrinking this portfolio and cost base, with 2014 spending to be reduced by 20 percent compared to 2013, and redirecting onshore investment to the lowest cost gas acreage with the best integration potential, and into on-going exploration in liquids-rich shales. At the same time, profitable growth should continue in deep-water and heavy oil, where an industry-leading development programme is underway. Here is some instant reaction to the Morrisons profit warning and restructuring. Retail analyst Nick Bubb says: The much-awaited Morrison\u2019s finals and property review today contain quite a few shocks, not least that Morrison\u2019s feel able to increase their dividend to 13.65p, despite a huge profit warning for the current year and a ton of write-offs for last year... At least Morrison\u2019s plan to focus on the core business and improve cash flow, helped by some property sales, but management will get a grilling at the analysts meeting in the City at 9.30am Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, says: In drawing a strategic line in the sand, Morrisons is attempting to close the widening gap with its rivals. The discount supermarkets have become a thorn in the side for the bigger players, and Morrison\u2019s lack of a properly established online or convenience store offering has seen its progress limited over recent times. The company has now decided that it is time to revitalise the business, which will inevitably come at a cost. Indeed, the outlook for next year is significantly lower and, whilst the new strategy is being implemented, the fiercely competitive supermarket sector will move on apace. Not all is doom and gloom within the numbers. The online and convenience store presence has at least now started, significant cost savings have been identified and, from an investment perspective, the current dividend yield of 4.7% will be boosted by another hike which reflects a continuation of the progressive policy. However, this sharp change of direction will require time and patience, which have been in short supply from investors. Even prior to today\u2019s tumble, the shares had fallen 23% over the last six months alone, as compared to a 1% hike for the wider FTSE100. Opinion remains divided over prospects for this beleaguered company, and the market consensus of the shares as a hold may well remain in place for now. Phil Dorrell, director of consultancy Retail Remedy, who used to manage stores himself, says: Is there anything left to lose? Morrisons is now emitting serious warning signs and this is the position it has been in for over a year. What\u2019s going wrong? Morrisons has an estate that lacks any format excitement, uninspired marketing, sharp competitors in Aldi and Lidl, and, to top it all off, zero sense of direction. It feels as dated as it does rudderless. It\u2019s playing catch-up in all areas of its business, from online to convenience. Dalton Philips is an experienced retailer but has failed to deliver a clear and robust strategy. The truth is that the main portfolio has simply not moved on in the four years he has been there. In the meantime, Aldi, Lidl and Waitrose are gorging themselves on his market share. Morrisons has even lost ground to the discounters on fresh foods. As an old-school grocer, the one thing Morrisons can do is run stores with discipline and standards but morale is eroding in the glaring absence of inspired leadership. The Kiddicare venture rapidly proved a mistake and simply delivered even more poorly formatted stores with an indistinct proposition. Kiddicare is now being kicked ignominiously into the long grass. Selling a percentage of the freeholds is a means to keep some share price dignity but means nothing without a clearly defined statement of intent and a strategy to make it all happen. The nasty surprise from Morrisons has sparked a sell-off in supermarket shares, wiping billions of pounds off the sector. Morrisons is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index, dropping more than 10% in early trading to 207.3p. Fellow grocers Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer are also big losers, down 6.6%, 3.5% and 1.9% respectively. Some shock news from Wm Morrison. Britain\u2019s No 4 supermarket chain has posted its lowest profit in five years and slashed its profit outlook for this year \u2013 its second profit warning this year. It announced a big restructuring, including selling \u00a31bn of property and offloading its Kiddicare baby products business. It has been losing out to discounters Aldi and Lidl, more than the rest of the \u201cBig Four\u201d supermarkets. The Yorkshire-based company made a profit before tax and one-off items of \u00a3785m in the year to 2 February, down 13% on the \u00a3901m the previous year. Including exceptional costs, it went into the red with a \u00a3176m loss \u2013 against an \u00a3879m profit the year before. Good morning. We are back with our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the economy, eurozone and business. A flurry of weaker-than-expected Chinese data point to a marked slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy at the start of the year. China\u2019s industrial production rose 8.6% in the first two months from a year earlier, disappointing market expectations of a 9.5% increase. This marked the worst performance since April 2009 (and was partly down to strikes and industrial unrest in Chinese factories). Consumer spending also appears to be running out of steam. Growth in retail sales was the slowest in three years, up 11.8% in January and February from a year earlier. Analysts had pencilled in a 13.5% gain. Investment in fixed assets fared even worse. It rose 17.9% in the same period \u2013 the weakest growth rate in 11 years and below forecasts of a 19.4% rise. Despite these numbers European stock markets are expected to open slightly higher \u2013 possibly a brief respite after yesterday\u2019s declines. Later today we have US retail sales for February, which are expected to show a small rebound, and weekly jobless figures. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: While US markets appear to be finding a level of support quite near their all-time highs, European markets continue to show much less resilience, weighed down by concerns about a slowdown in China, as well as worries about where the current uncertain situation in Ukraine is going to lead, and the possibility of tit-for-tat sanctions with Russia as attitudes harden on both sides. The decision by EU leaders not to recognise the legality of the weekend referendum in Crimea, endorsed by US President Obama being the latest escalation, in a very fluid situation. Add a little Turkey unrest to the mix and the geopolitical backdrop has all the ingredients to get a little uglier, which may not bode well for stocks in the event of further trouble. Since the 24th of February the German DAX has fallen over 5%, not too much of surprise given that two of Germany\u2019s export markets are to China and Russia. Contrast that with the S&amp;P500, which over the same period is actually 0.9% higher.",

They said political risks were decreasing, helped by plans to focus investment on the US rather than UK, and there was hidden value in its upstream assets. With an overweight rating and 380p target price, they said:</p> <blockquote> It has been 12 months since Centrica's management announced a strategy announcement to focus investment on the US rather than the UK. This strategy was vindicated by the prospect of intervention in the UK supply market by the Labour party if elected to government in 2015 and the lack of political drive to offer attractive investment incentives for new gas-fired generation. <br> At the full year results on 20 February, management pointed out that 20% of Centrica's customers are already on a fixed-price contract so progress has been made on encouraging customers to fix prices, which helps to mitigate political risk. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> fell back for the fifth day running, down 67.12 points to 6553.78. More signs of a slowdown in China, with disappointing retail sales and factory output data, and a warning from premier Li Keqiang of severe challenges to the country's economy set the early downbeat tone. The continuing tensions in Ukraine ahead of a possible divisive referendum in Crimea on Sunday also unnerved investors, while good US data and comments from Federal Reserve nominee Stanley Fischer revived concerns about the Fed bringing its monthly bond buying programme to a gradual close. The US central bank releases its latest monthly update on Wednesday, and further tapering could well be on the cards.</p> <p>Back in the UK, retailers were in the spotlight.</p> <p><strong>Morrisons</strong> slumped 27.8p or 12% to 205.2p after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/13/morrisons-shares-profit-warning-supermarket-price-cutting\" title=\"\">a new profit warning</a>, with worries about a price war also hitting its rivals. <strong>J Sainsbury</strong> fell 28.3p to 304.9p and <strong>Tesco</strong> dropped 15.65p to 298.75p.

      "bodyText": "On another down day for markets, with leading shares at a five week low, British Gas owner Centrica bucked the trend. Its shares added 6.9p to 334.8p after an upbeat note on the business from analysts at HSBC. They said political risks were decreasing, helped by plans to focus investment on the US rather than UK, and there was hidden value in its upstream assets. With an overweight rating and 380p target price, they said: It has been 12 months since Centrica's management announced a strategy announcement to focus investment on the US rather than the UK. This strategy was vindicated by the prospect of intervention in the UK supply market by the Labour party if elected to government in 2015 and the lack of political drive to offer attractive investment incentives for new gas-fired generation. At the full year results on 20 February, management pointed out that 20% of Centrica's customers are already on a fixed-price contract so progress has been made on encouraging customers to fix prices, which helps to mitigate political risk. Overall the FTSE 100 fell back for the fifth day running, down 67.12 points to 6553.78. More signs of a slowdown in China, with disappointing retail sales and factory output data, and a warning from premier Li Keqiang of severe challenges to the country's economy set the early downbeat tone. The continuing tensions in Ukraine ahead of a possible divisive referendum in Crimea on Sunday also unnerved investors, while good US data and comments from Federal Reserve nominee Stanley Fischer revived concerns about the Fed bringing its monthly bond buying programme to a gradual close. The US central bank releases its latest monthly update on Wednesday, and further tapering could well be on the cards. Back in the UK, retailers were in the spotlight. Morrisons slumped 27.8p or 12% to 205.2p after a new profit warning, with worries about a price war also hitting its rivals. J Sainsbury fell 28.3p to 304.9p and Tesco dropped 15.65p to 298.75p.

    "webTitle": "Morrisons profit warning sparks supermarket share panic", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than \u00a32bn was wiped off the value of the UK's listed supermarkets on Thursday as Morrisons said taking on discounters such as Aldi and Lidl with aggressive price cuts would slash profits by more than 50%. Fears that Tesco and Sainsbury's would also be forced to slash profits to deal with cut-price rivals dragged down their shares by 4.9% and 8.4% respectively. Shares in the online grocer Ocado, which delivers food for Morrisons, and Marks &amp; Spencer also took a hit. However, Morrisons shares posted the worst performance in the FTSE 100 as a second profit warning in three months triggered a 12% slump. Morrisons has been hammered by a sea change in shopping habits. It has been stranded as consumers turn away from large out-of-town outlets to online purchases and convenience stores. The grocer is also suffering because it is no longer viewed as one of the cheapest places to shop, it has out-of-date IT systems, no loyalty card and too many shabby stores. In a new turnaround strategy, the Bradford-based grocer said it would sell off \u00a31bn of property assets over the next three years to help fund its dividend. Savings and efficiencies also equal to \u00a31bn will be invested in price cuts, promotions and store improvements over the same period, starting with \u00a3300m this year. Meanwhile, Morrisons is to pull out of expensive adventures into the children's clothing brand Kiddicare at a cost of \u00a3163m as well as the US online grocer Fresh Direct. Despite the multibillion pound announcements, the fightback was overshadowed by the profit warning. The company admitted profits would fall to between \u00a3325m and \u00a3375m in the year to February 2015. Analysts had expected a profit of about \u00a3732m for this year. That follows an already tough year, which saw Morrisons post an underlying pretax profit of \u00a3785m for the year to February 2014 \u2013 down 13%, but in line with analysts' depressed expectations. Revenue fell 2% to \u00a317.7bn. Dalton Philips, Morrisons' embattled chief executive, said the grocery sector was undergoing its biggest upheaval since supermarkets emerged in the 1950s, with business moving online and the squeeze on living standards boosting the appeal of low-cost German upstarts Aldi and Lidl. \"We overlap with the discounters more than anybody else, our customers have felt the austerity programme more than anybody else and these are bold steps to put us back on track. \"This is the right plan for this business in this landscape. We can't ignore this structural shift,\" Philips said. He admitted that even with the price cuts it would take time for Morrisons to see underlying sales growth again. \"I'm obviously not going to forecast when,\" he said. In an attempt to win over shareholders, Morrisons promised to increase its dividend by 5% this year, and said it would return more capital to investors in future. The 2013 payout rose 10% to 13p.

      "body": "<p>More than \u00a32bn was wiped off the value of the UK's listed supermarkets on Thursday as Morrisons said taking on discounters such as Aldi and Lidl with aggressive price cuts would slash profits by more than 50%.</p> <p>Fears that Tesco and Sainsbury's would also be forced to slash profits to deal with cut-price rivals dragged down their shares by 4.9% and 8.4% respectively. Shares in the online grocer Ocado, which delivers food for Morrisons, and Marks &amp; Spencer also took a hit.</p> <p>However, Morrisons shares posted the worst performance in the FTSE 100 as a second profit warning in three months triggered a 12% slump.</p> <p>Morrisons has been hammered by a sea change in shopping habits. It has been stranded as consumers turn away from large out-of-town outlets to online purchases and convenience stores. The grocer is also suffering because it is no longer viewed as one of the cheapest places to shop, it has out-of-date IT systems, no loyalty card and too many shabby stores.</p> <p>In a new turnaround strategy, the Bradford-based grocer said it would sell off \u00a31bn of property assets over the next three years to help fund its dividend. Savings and efficiencies also equal to \u00a31bn will be invested in price cuts, promotions and store improvements over the same period, starting with \u00a3300m this year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Morrisons is to pull out of expensive adventures into the children's clothing brand Kiddicare at a cost of \u00a3163m as well as the US online grocer Fresh Direct.</p> <p>Despite the multibillion pound announcements, the fightback was overshadowed by the profit warning. The company admitted profits would fall to between \u00a3325m and \u00a3375m in the year to February 2015. Analysts had expected a profit of about \u00a3732m for this year.</p> <p>That follows an already tough year, which saw Morrisons post an underlying pretax profit of \u00a3785m for the year to February 2014 \u2013 down 13%, but in line with analysts' depressed expectations. Revenue fell 2% to \u00a317.7bn.</p> <p>Dalton Philips, Morrisons' embattled chief executive, said the grocery sector was undergoing its biggest upheaval since supermarkets emerged in the 1950s, with business moving online and the squeeze on living standards boosting the appeal of low-cost German upstarts Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>\"We overlap with the discounters more than anybody else, our customers have felt the austerity programme more than anybody else and these are bold steps to put us back on track.</p> <p>\"This is the right plan for this business in this landscape. We can't ignore this structural shift,\" Philips said.</p> <p>He admitted that even with the price cuts it would take time for Morrisons to see underlying sales growth again. \"I'm obviously not going to forecast when,\" he said.</p> <p>In an attempt to win over shareholders, Morrisons promised to increase its dividend by 5% this year, and said it would return more capital to investors in future. The 2013 payout rose 10% to 13p.</p> <p>Asked how long the board would give him to turn the company round, Philips, who joined Morrisons four years ago, said he had dealt with gaps in convenience and online trading and upgraded the \"antiquated\" computer systems he inherited. \"I've addressed all three of the first [problems] and now I am addressing the discounters,\" he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shell paid former chief executive Peter Voser \u00a322m over two years even though there was a profit warning soon after he left and his successor says the business has failed to perform as strongly as it should have done. The 2013 annual report published on Thursday shows that Voser, who left at the turn of the year, received total remuneration of just over \u00a37m last year and almost \u00a315m in 2012. His basic salary was relatively modest by oil company standards \u2013 but he made enormous gains through share awards and other performance-related bonuses accumulated over a number of years but paid out in 2012 and 2013. Yet his successor, Ben van Beurden, who took over at the start of this year, said in a management briefing paper prepared for stock market analysts that it was clear \"we need to get a tighter grip on performance management in Shell\". He has previously signalled he planned to take the axe to spending and possibly sell off some of Voser's signature \u2013 but high cost \u2013 projects in the US shale lands, the Niger Delta and possibly even the Arctic. In a written statement, he said US exploration and development would be cut by 20%. He gave few other details but rather presented a broad overview of strategy. \"With sharper accountability in the company, this approach will target growth investment more effectively, focus on areas of the business where performance improvement is most required, and drive asset sales from non-strategic positions,\" he argued. Shell had already sold off $4.5bn (\u00a32.7bn) worth of assets in the first two and a half months of this year and was still aiming to dispose of $15bn worth of interests between now and the end of 2015, he said. Among the properties exited so far are a liquefied natural gas project in Australia, a gas-to-liquid scheme in the US and other operations in Italy. Plans to sell off shale assets in America are proving more difficult that the company would like, industry analysts said. Van Beurden said Shell would maintaining its existing cash \"engines\" in the exploration and development business which are delivering high returns and strong cash flow. It would also continue with \"growth priorities\" \u2013 deep-water and integrated gas while identifying \"future opportunities\" for the longer term, including Nigeria, Iraq and Kazakhstan. But the City seemed disappointed by the lack of detail in the management statement and shares drifted down 14.5p to \u00a321.76\u00bd in early trading.",
