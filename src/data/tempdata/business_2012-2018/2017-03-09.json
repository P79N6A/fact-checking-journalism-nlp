      "bodyText": "The scale of pay deals on offer in FTSE 100 boardrooms has been illustrated by the latest payout to Sir Martin Sorrell, who was awarded more than \u00a340m in 2016 taking the total payout to the chief executive of marketing and advertising company WPP in the past five years to more than \u00a3200m. The long-term bonus payments to Sorrell were published alongside the latest pay deals at oil company Shell, which revealed its chief executive\u2019s pay had risen 54% in 2016. Ben van Beurden received \u20ac8.6m (\u00a37m) in 2016, taking his pay since he took the helm of the Anglo-Dutch company in 2014 to \u00a335m. Major stock market listed companies are revealing the pay of their top executives at a time of renewed scrutiny of corporate Britain since the vote for Brexit and the warning by Theresa May that she would curb boardroom excess. Some companies have already heeded attempts by shareholders to respond to the political backdrop, notably Imperial Brands, the maker of Gauloises and John Player cigarettes, which scrapped a pay rise for chief executive Alison Cooper in the face of a potential protest at its annual meeting in January. Among other companies publishing details of pay deals on Thursday was Rolls-Royce, which paid annual bonuses to its executive for the first time in three years. Its chief executive, Warren East, who is leading the clean-up operation of the engine-maker after its \u00a3671m charge to settle bribery and corruption charges with the Serious Fraud Office and authorities in the US and Brazil, received a \u00a3916,000 bonus taking his total pay to \u00a32m. After Royal Bank of Scotland revealed on Wednesday it had handed \u00a316m in bonuses to its top executives, Barclays disclosed its top management had been granted \u00a39m in future bonuses and shared \u00a313.6m from bonuses paid out in the past. The pay of WPP\u2019s Sorrell has been a flashpoint in the past. In 2012 - during what became known as the shareholder spring - nearly 60% of investors rejected his annual pay package for the previous year. It sparked changes to his pay deals which were generated by the leadership equity acquisition plan (Leap) which has payed out multi-million pound share deals for Sorrell. The latest \u00a341.6m payout is the last from the Leap scheme, which will be replaced with a less generous deal which investors expect to pay out less than \u00a320m. The near \u00a342m will be added to Sorrell\u2019s salary, bonus and other extras when WPPpublish its annual report and will probably push his full remuneration for 2016to closer to \u00a350m. WPP said the payout from the Leap is down 34% on the \u00a362.8m he received last year. Since 2012, Sorrell has received close to \u00a3210m in total remuneration, which has consistently ranked him the highest-paid chief executive in the FTSE 100. Despite WPP\u2019s pledge to overhaul executive pay, shareholders have continued to issue rebukes: in 2014, 30% refused to endorse Sorrell\u2019s remuneration and last year, a third refused to back the \u00a370.4m he received, one of the biggest pay cheques in UK corporate history. \u201cThis is the final outcome of the wholly performance-related Leap scheme which was replaced in 2013 with a new long-term scheme with a much-reduced opportunity approved by share owners,\u201d said a WPP spokesman. Last year, Sorrell defended his pay package arguing he had put three decades of his life into building WPP from a maker of wire baskets into a \u00a321bn global marketing business. \u201cI\u2019m not a Johnny come lately who picked a company up and turned it round [for a big payday],\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was one five-year plan and we buggered off, fine [to criticise my pay]. Over those 31 years \u2026 I have taken a significant degree of risk. [WPP] is where my wealth is. It is long effort over a long period of time.\u201d In December, the chair of WPP\u2019s pay committee, Sir John Hood, told MPs that Sorrell was not on a \u201csuperstar\u201d salary. The annual report for Shell shows that van Beurden\u2019s \u20ac8.6m follows \u20ac5.5m in 2013 and \u20ac24.1m in 2014, his first year at the helm when his pay was inflated by by pension payments and \u201ctax equalisation\u201d handouts. It shows that 10% of future bonuses will be linked to managing greenhouse gas emissions. Shell also reveals the debate going on among some investors who want to end the current system of long-term incentive plans, paying out over three years, with awards of restricted shares which do not have performance criteria. The oil company is not yet doing this because of the lack of agreement among shareholders. Rolls-Royce, which recently reported the biggest annual loss in its history \u2013 \u00a34.6bn - revealed that some of its shareholders thought the executive bonuses should be bigger.",

      "bodyText": "The government has come under fire for claiming that 90% of pubs in England could benefit from a \u00a31,000 business rates discount, with critics claiming that far fewer will actually receive the relief. Philip Hammond announced in the budget on Wednesday that pubs with a rateable value of less than \u00a3100,000 would receive a \u00a31,000 discount on their business rates bill this year. The chancellor said that 90% of all pubs had a rateable value of less than \u00a3100,000. This measure was part of a \u00a3435m relief package designed to dampen criticism of the controversial changes to business rates which mean that some firms will see their tax bill double from April. However, property consultancy Gerald Eve says its research shows a maximum of 61% of pubs will benefit. It found there are just under 40,000 properties in England described as public houses and 3,700 of these have a rateable value of more than \u00a3100,000, meaning they do not qualify for the discount. Of the remainder, about 12,000 pubs already get rates relief because they are classed as small businesses. This means that a maximum of 24,375 pubs out of 40,000 will be eligible for the discount, which is 61%. However, not all of these 24,375 pubs will receive the discount. The budget document \u2013 the red book \u2013 that the discount is \u201csubject to state aid limits for businesses with multiple properties\u201d. EU rules restrict state aid to \u20ac200,000 (\u00a3174,000) per business over three years. This means that the pubs that are part of chains such as JD Wetherspoon are most likely to miss out. Jerry Schurder, the head of business rates at Gerald Eve, said the government had been \u201cat best disingenuous\u201d to claim that 90% of pubs could benefit. \u201cWith a maximum of 61% of pubs set to benefit from the new rates discount, rather than the 90% stated by the chancellor in his budget, the government has yet again been caught exaggerating the benefits that ratepayers will see,\u201d he said. \u201cFacts should be presented to business as they really are, rather than misrepresented in the hope of some cheap headlines. The chancellor risks losing the trust of business, and a good place to start in regaining that good faith would be to tell it like it is.\u201d The discount is only eligible in England because the business rates system is devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The government has estimated the cost of the measure at just \u00a325m. Business rates will bring in almost \u00a330bn for the Treasury this year, making it one of the government\u2019s biggest sources of income. Pubs that expect to receive the discount have welcomed the support but called for an overhaul of business rates. Keith Bott, who runs Titanic Brewery with his brother Dave, operating eight pubs in Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire, said: \u201cTo make that extra \u00a31,000 that we now won\u2019t have to pay, we would have had to sell \u00a32,000 worth of beer. Additional costs that don\u2019t bring us any benefit make it more difficult to keep pubs viable. \u201cThis [\u00a31,000 discount] gives us some relief for the next 12 months. We need to keep up the pressure to get a fairer system for the future. If digital businesses pay their fair share, we can reset tax burden on those businesses that are based in properties.\u201d The Society of Independent Brewers said: \u201cThe \u00a31,000 reduction in business rates for pubs with a rateable value below \u00a3100,000 is welcome support for the sector, although much more needs to be done. \u201cBut this contrasts sharply with the 2p increase on beer tax which is a blow for the millions of people who enjoy a pint of British beer in their local pub and also for Britain\u2019s 1,800 small brewing businesses across the country.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Fifteen years without a pay rise. The most protracted squeeze on real wages since Nelson\u2019s victory over Napoleon\u2019s fleet in the Battle of Trafalgar. A lost decade for productivity growth. The gist of the post-budget analysis from two of Britain\u2019s leading thinktanks was simple: the economy continues to break records \u2013 mostly for the wrong reasons. Neither the Institute for Fiscal Studies nor the Resolution Foundation could get especially worked up about the political controversy of the moment: Philip Hammond\u2019s decision to raise national insurance contributions for the self-employed. The move was seen as progressive and a small step in the direction of aligning the treatment of the employed and the self-employed. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said Hammond appeared to be breaking a Conservative manifesto commitment but lambasted the government for making such a \u201csilly\u201d pledge in the first place. Instead, both organisations focused on the bigger picture: the performance of the UK in the years since the onset of the recession since 2008 and what is likely to happen over the next 10 years. Johnson pointed out just how woeful the productivity performance of the UK economy had been since 2008. Growth in living standards depends on improvements in productivity, which in the years leading up to the financial crisis averaged more than 2% a year. In the nine years since 2008, Johnson noted, per capita incomes had grown by 2% in total. \u201cThat\u2019s nine years to grow as much as it would normally grow in one.\u201d What\u2019s more, the productivity growth that has been lost will never come back. That\u2019s because the Office for Budget Responsibility believes the UK has run out of spare capacity, which means the economy cannot grow any faster without generating inflation. Johnson said: \u201cWhat the OBR is saying is that, despite that truly dismal record, all of the productivity \u2013 and with it earnings growth \u2013 we would normally expect has been lost forever. \u201cThis remains the big story of the last decade: a decade without growth, a decade without precedent in the UK in modern times.\u201d Unusually low inflation since 2014 has led to a pick-up in real income growth but rebounding oil prices and dearer imports as a result of the pound\u2019s post-Brexit fall mean this period is coming to an end. The IFS says that on current forecasts, real average earnings will be no higher in 2022 than they were in 2007. \u201cFifteen years without a pay rise,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m rather lost for superlatives. This is completely unprecedented.\u201d Top earners have had a relatively tough time, with their real earnings 12% lower in 2015-16 than they were when the recession started. Johnson said the top 1% pulled away from the rest in the 2000s but were being reeled back in. The ratio between earnings at the 99th percentile and those at the median hit 5 to 1 in the late 2000s but had fallen back at 4.6 to 1 now, about where it was in 1999. Torsten Bell, the Resolution Foundation\u2019s director, says it is possible to find a decade that was as bleak for wage earners as the 2010s but you have to go back to a time when William Pitt the Younger was prime minister to find it. The Resolution Foundation concentrates on those on low and middle incomes \u2013 a group it sees as particularly vulnerable in the years ahead. Weak pay growth and benefit cuts mean that for the poorest third of households, the second half of the 2010s will actually be tougher than the first half. The IFS agrees. It notes that the budget changes announced by Hammond pale into insignificance when set against those introduced by George Osborne before he was sacked by Theresa May. The former chancellor \u2013 now picking up \u00a3650,000 a year for four days work a month at the fund manager BlackRock \u2013 pushed through benefit cuts that will mean some families will be \u00a37,000 a year worse off than they would have been otherwise.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Workers in Britain are on course to suffer an unprecedented 15 years of lost earnings growth and have been warned to prepare for a third successive parliament of austerity by a leading thinktank. Analysing Philip Hammond\u2019s spring budget, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that after suffering a lost decade of earnings growth, households were now about to be hit by big welfare cuts. Paul Johnson, the thinktank\u2019s director, highlighted permanent scars to the UK economy from the global financial crisis and said that almost a decade on the prospects for income and earnings growth remained weak. \u201cOn current forecasts average earnings will be no higher in 2022 than they were in 2007. Fifteen years without a pay rise. I\u2019m rather lost for superlatives. This is completely unprecedented,\u201d he said at the IFS\u2019s traditional post-budget day briefing. Johnson said the latest economic outlook from the government\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, implied that in the wake of the financial crisis the UK had suffered permanent losses to productivity \u2013 a measure of output per hour. \u201cAll of the productivity \u2013 and with it earnings growth \u2013 we would normally expect has been lost forever. This remains the big story of the last decade \u2013 a decade without growth, a decade without precedent in the UK in modern times,\u201d he said. The IFS noted the OBR\u2019s forecasts for the public finances left the UK on course to borrow \u00a320bn in 2020, which is \u00a330bn more than intended a year ago. \u201cThat leaves a lot of work to do in the next parliament to get to the planned budget balance. It looks like being, I\u2019m afraid, a third parliament of austerity,\u201d said Johnson. Similarly, he underscored welfare cuts announced under Hammond\u2019s predecessor George Osborne that start to come into force next month. \u201cThese will have much bigger effects on people\u2019s incomes than anything announced [on Wednesday].\u201d The IFS had a relatively positive appraisal of the controversial changes made by Hammond to taxes paid by the self-employed. Johnson said increases in national insurance contributions (NICs) for the self-employed represented a \u201cmodest but welcome change\u201d designed to create a slightly less unequal playing field between the self-employed and employees.\u201d The IFS warning on incomes follows the claim earlier on Thursday by the Resolution Foundation that the UK is in the midst of the worst decade for pay growth since the Napoleonic wars of 1803\u20131815. In a grim assessment of the new budget forecasts, the thinktank said families would miss out on \u00a312,000 of pay growth by 2020, the worst decade for 210 years. Workers will be hit with falling real pay, where inflation exceeds wage growth, in the coming months, Resolution said. Real average earnings are only expected to return to their pre-crisis peak by the end of 2022. Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cThe big picture from [Wednesday\u2019s] budget is that the big squeezes on both the public and family finances have been prolonged well into the 2020s. \u201cWhile the Office for Budget Responsibility at least delivered some good news on borrowing, the family finances picture has actually deteriorated since the autumn statement. Britain is set for a return to falling real pay later this year, with this decade now set to be the worst for pay growth since the Napoleonic wars. Bell said that some households would feel the pinch more than others. \u201cThe combination of weak pay growth and over \u00a312bn of benefit cuts means that for the poorest third of households this parliament is actually set to be worse than the years following the financial crisis.\u201d Resolution calculates that a single person working full time on the minimum wage \u2013 earning \u00a313,150 \u2013 will be \u00a3380 worse off by 2020. A dual-earning couple with two children and combined earnings of \u00a329,020 will be \u00a3360 a year worse off by 2020. Anita Charlesworth, director of economics at The Health Foundation, said the chancellor had rebuffed calls for more health spending, but resources in the NHS were thin. \u201cThe next parliament will need to find an extra 1% of GDP in austerity measures and 1% extra for the NHS. I don\u2019t know how we do that within the existing tax base,\u201d she said. The amount of tax Britons pay as a percentage of GDP is due to hit a 30-year high in 2019 of 37.5%. Tony Travers, a local government expert at the London School of Economics, said councils were shouldering the burden of austerity and would soon be confined to providing only statutory services such as adult and children\u2019s social care. \u201cThere is a straight line of falls in discretionary spending that ends in the next parliament at zero, leaving no money for anything other than the legal minimum,\u201d he said.",

The retailer\u2019s announcement that it is to appoint a worker to the board (Sports Direct to recruit workers\u2019 representative after scandals, theguardian.com, 9 March) might please some Whitehall officials and certain elements of the shareholder community, but let\u2019s be clear: it will do little, if anything, to resolve the corporate governance problems at the company.

It is not just a case of launching an independent review into its corporate governance, as Ashley did in fact do last year.

    "webTitle": "Euro rises as ECB president Draghi says single currency is 'irrevocable'- as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. Here\u2019s AFP\u2019s take on the ECB press conference. The European Central Bank reported signs of an improving eurozone economy Thursday, but said it would keep cheap money gushing for fear of undermining the recovery. ECB watchers were alert for any tightening of the ECB\u2019s ultra-loose policy as inflation rates rise and prospects for growth in the 19-nation single currency area improve. The central bank has set interest rates at record lows and buys tens of billions of euros of bonds per month in a bid to drive up growth and inflation. At the meeting of the bank\u2019s governing council \u201cthere was a general recognition that the balance of risk has improved, certainly as far as growth is concerned,\u201d ECB president Mario Draghi told reporters. \u201cThere is no longer that sense of urgency in taking further actions.\u201d But \u201cthis is a gradual process,\u201d he went on at a Frankfurt press conference. \u201cThe governing council members want to be convinced they see a self-sustained adjustment in the inflation rate\u201d before closing the money sluices, he said. For now, faced with uncertain impacts from global upheavals abroad and elections at home, the ECB plans to continue its bond-buying scheme until December as planned, as well as maintaining its commitment to interest rates \u201cat present or lower levels\u201d for the foreseeable future. \u201cSpring is coming and the ECB is celebrating,\u201d judged analyst Florian Hense of Berenberg bank, while noting that, despite the lifting spirits, \u201cit has not moved significantly closer to actually tightening policy\u201d.... Goodnight. GW Kathleen Brooks of City Index says Mario Draghi has proved he was the \u201cking of curveballs\u201d at today\u2019s press conference in Frankfurt. After delivering what was arguably a dovish statement early on in his press conference, and clearly stating that for the ECB\u2019s GDP and inflation forecasts are conditional on the implementation \u201cof all our policy measures\u201d, Draghi displayed a more hawkish tone during the Q&amp;A. The key takeaway from this month\u2019s ECB meeting appears contradictory: QE is here to stay in the Eurozone, until at least the end of this year. However, more policy action is less likely because deflation risks have receded. Reading between the lines suggests that the next change from the ECB will be towards removing accommodation and not adding it. Aberdeen Asset Management investment manager Patrick O\u2019Donnell says Draghi has given a small hint that the ECB could adjust its policy stance soon: \u201cDraghi has ever so slightly opened the door to changing their policy stance. He\u2019s done this by saying that the Governing Council talked about changing the language about where rates are in their monthly statement, but didn\u2019t actually change it. This is effectively him signalling that something might change in the future, just not today. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic Draghi technique of saying something that will move markets without actually doing anything. Due to this, and a wordy response to a question about raising rates before QE ends, markets will now start to recalibrate on the assumption that the ECB will remove accommodation towards the end of the year.\u201d Jamie Dutta, senior market analyst at Faraday Research, says the ECB president \u201cflip-flopped\u2019 between his bearish opening statement, and some bullish remarks in the press conference. The ECB and Mario Draghi celebrated its two year anniversary of its Asset Purchase Program by being marginally less dovish than expected in the monthly press conference. It was an interesting balancing act for Draghi between unchanged monetary policy stimulus policies and improved economic prospects. The market took the upgraded forecasts for growth and inflation in its stride. However they reacted more positively when Draghi stated that there was no longer a \u2018sense of urgency on taking further actions\u2019 to boost inflation and the recovery. Indeed Draghi further said the \u2018risks to deflation have largely disappeared\u2019. And Pictet\u2019s Frederik Ducrozet shows how the ECB has raised its forecasts for inflation in 2017 and 2018: The press conference ends with Mario Draghi insisting that the euro is irrevocable, and not going to break up. The ECB president declares that: The euro is here to stay. It\u2019s not about whether or not it is irrevocable. It is. The ECB president calls the euro a \u201cchannel for solidarity\u201d (which might rankle with those suffering financial plight in Greece). Draghi points out that Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania all joined the single currency since the financial crisis began, due to the benefits of membership. We need to make monetary union function better, Draghi adds, to increase prosperity in the region. And this bullish talk has helped to push the euro up. It\u2019s currently up 0.6% at $1.06. German bond prices are falling, driving up the yield on the debt. Traders are reacting to the news that the ECB has dropped its pledge to use \u2018all available instruments\u2019 to achieve its mandate, and is now less worried about deflation. Mario Draghi is treading an interesting path at today\u2019s press conference. On the one hand, he\u2019s talking up the prospects for the eurozone economy and saying there is no longer a deflation risk. But he\u2019s also warning that there are \u2018downside risks\u2019 that could derail the recovery. Why? Because he\u2019s got a firm eye on upcoming elections, particularly in France. Q: Were today\u2019s decisions unanimous? Enigmatically, Draghi says the discussion was \u2018consensual\u2019..... Rather sweetly, Draghi suggests that it\u2019s 18 months since Britain voted to leave the EU. Just nine, old boy. Although it sometimes feels like nine years... Draghi says the governing council did not discuss ending its QE programme, or boosting it, at today\u2019s meeting. Mario Draghi sounds somewhat concerned about geopolitics, warning that global risks have risen recently. We haven\u2019t yet seen negative consequences from the Brexit vote, he adds, but it\u2019s not clear how various \u2018risk events\u2019 will play out. Draghi is asked about the criticism of Germany\u2019s trade surplus from Peter Navarro, trade advisor to Donald Trump, who argues that the euro is unfairly weak. Draghi defends Berlin, saying he doesn\u2019t see any merit in attacking Germany. Germany\u2019s currency is the euro, and eurozone monetary policy is set for the whole region, he insists. Q: Could the ECB raise interest rates before it has ended its QE programme? Draghi ducks the question. And that\u2019s interesting, as he\u2019s previously insisted that rate would not rise until the asset-purchase programme had concludes. On deflation....Mario Draghi says that the risks have \u201clargely disappeared\u201d, adding: Market-based inflation expectations have increased noticeably. In a hawkish move, the European central bank has dropped an important line from its statement. The pledge to use \u201call the instruments at its disposal\u201d if necessary to achieve it mandates has been removed. Mario Draghi says this has been dropped because the \u201csense of urgency\u201d has gone, suggesting the ECB is less worried about the situation. Hello again. Sorry about that breakdown - while I was away, Mario Draghi has been speaking to the press in Frankfurt. The ECB president has announced slightly higher growth forecasts; GDP is now expected to rise by 1.8% in 2017 (up from 1.7% in December) and by 1.6% in 2018 (up from 1.5%) It has also raised its inflation forecast this year to 1.7% (from 1.3%). Draghi still sound cautious, saying: The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have become less pronounced, but remain tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors. We\u2019re having a few technical issues here , so might miss the start of the ECB press conference #developing.... Markus Ferber, a German conservative MEP, is unhappy that the European Central Bank didn\u2019t raise interest rates today. Ferber argues that the ECB should have responded to the recent rise in euro area inflation, to 2%. \u201cThe inflation rate is picking up and the European economy is growing strongly. Now would be the perfect time for Mario Draghi to show a little courage and end the period of zero interest rate. The craving for cheap money is like an addiction that has to stop now. This is even more so as monetary policy in the USA and the EU are at risk of drifting further and further apart. In the US, the main interest rate is already higher than in the Eurozone and the Federal Reserve plans to have two to three additional interest rate hikes this year alone. I am disappointed that the ECB missed yet another chance to initialise a normalisation of monetary policy.\u201c Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says investors need to watch the political landscape closely, to understand why the ECB didn\u2019t change policy today. We have two major events coming up which can have some serious impact on the Euro; the elections in Netherland and elections over in France. If any of these anti- euro party wins the election, this would create a lot of trouble for the European central bank. Basically, when you have the concept of euro under threat, the last thing you want to do is to create more panic in the market. It is in Draghi\u2019s interest to keep buying more time until we have navigated through all these storms and sailing becomes smoother. While we wait for Draghi, here\u2019s a photo of a papier mache caricature of Europe\u2019s most powerful central banker, from the Rose Monday carnival parade in Cologne last month. It must have been popular with German savers who dislike Draghi\u2019s decision to cut interest rates to zero. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to the ECB announcement: The European Central Bank has also declared it will keep running its stimulus programme. And despite pressure from hawks to start tightening, the ECB insists it could boost its bond-buying firepower if needed. The ECB says: : Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that it will continue to make purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of \u20ac80 billion until the end of this month and that, from April 2017, the net asset purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of \u20ac60 billion until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The net purchases will be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. Here we go! The European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged at today\u2019s meeting, and kept its pledge to cut them again in future if needed. That means that borrowing costs stay at their current record lows, despite inflation jumping to 2% this month. So: the main rate sticks at 0.0% The deposit facility rate stays at -0.4% (meaning commercial banks will be charged for leaving funds at the ECB). The marginal lending rate, charged when banks borrow from the ECB, stays at 0.25% There\u2019s no change to the commitment to keep borrowing costs low, either. The ECB says: The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. Capital Economics predict that Mario Draghi will resist pressure to start considering tightening monetary policy: Here\u2019s something for the ECB to chew on -- more than three quarters of Greek families have difficulty, or great difficulty, making ends meet. That\u2019s one factoid in a new UK report into national wellbeing, released this morning by the Office for National Statistics. It says: According to data from Eurostat, 16% of all households in the UK reported great difficulty or difficulty in making ends meet in 2015. This was lower than the estimated EU\u201328 average of 26%, and was the same as Estonia (16%). The countries with the highest proportion of households reporting great difficulty or difficulty in making ends meet were Greece (78%) and Bulgaria (64%), while the lowest proportion of households were in Sweden (5%) and Finland (7%). The full report is online: Measuring national well-being in the UK: international comparisons, 2017 It\u2019s nearly time for the European Central Bank to end the suspense (!) and reveal the results of today\u2019s governing council meeting, at 12.45 GMT (1.45pm in Frankfurt) We\u2019re not expecting any changes to interest rates, but the ECB easily change the language in today\u2019s announcement. That could include dropping the suggestion that interest rates could be cut to new record lows, or that it stands ready to boost its bond-buying programme. Nick Kounis of ABN Amro explains: ECB expert Fred Ducrozet of Pictet Bank predicts that Mario Draghi will make some subtle changes to his statement at 1.30pm GMT (2.30pm Frankfurt time). Fred also expects the ECB to raise its forecasts for growth and inflation this year. Sir Martin Sorrell, the advertising magnate, isn\u2019t suffering from the wage squeeze. WPP has reported that CEO Sorrell will receive more than \u00a340m though its LEAP incentive plan, pushing his total package closer to \u00a350m. This is the final instalment of LEAP, as my colleague Mark Sweney explains: It\u2019s turning into a bad week for the markets. Shares, bonds and commodity prices have all weakened since Monday, the cost of insuring bonds has gone up, and most currencies have lost ground against the US dollar. In London the FTSE 100 index is now down 50 points, or 0.6%, at 7283, and on track for its sixth loss in a row. Oil companies have now joined the big fallers, with Shell down 3% following the drop in the crude price. Mining stocks are being hit hard too. There\u2019s a generally nervous mood in the markets, as the rally that begin after the US election fades. Chris Beauchamp of IG sums up the mood: Signs of a broad-based risk off mentality are cropping up like spring daffodils at present. Yesterday\u2019s plunge in oil prices took most of the attention, but the other major warning signal was the rout in junk bonds; like stocks these have gained significantly since the election, and like stocks they enjoyed more gains in February. The heavy selling in the high yield ETF over the past week sounds another alarm for equity bulls. To add to the signs of doom, mining shares in London are in full-blown retreat, as a stronger dollar and falling commodity prices take their toll The German banking industry has urged the European Central Bank to give a signal today that it could start unwinding its ultra-loose monetary policy stance soon. Reuters has the story: The BdB private banking association said the fact that the threat of deflation has disappeared in the euro zone and inflation was picking up justified its recommendation. \u201cSuch a step must be prepared very, very well\u201d and policymakers should communicate it carefully, BdB head Michael Kemmer told Deutschlandfunk radio on Thursday. \u201cBut it would be important, I think, that the ECB today opens the door to the exit (of its expansive monetary policy),\u201d Kemmer said. How would that door open? One option is that the ECB could drop its pledge that interest rates would remain at current or lower levels for an extended period. Or, Mario Draghi could outline how it would slow (or taper) its QE programme. But as flagged earlier, many analysts think there are good reasons to leave the exit door locked. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says: Draghi doesn\u2019t want a repeat of 2011 or 2008, when the ECB tightened too quickly. This fear is likely to drive policymakers to remain dovish and keep the taps open. The risks remain to the downside - even with what markets consider \u2018too much\u2019 QE. The \u2018high class problem\u2019 talked about by Draghi is that the European economy is doing better and the talk is now of tightening. The longer the ECB is minded to refrain from changing policy, the more markets will expect a rate rise or tapering to come. Indeed markets are doing a lot of the tightening work for the ECB as the front end of the yield curve is rising. Newsflash: The price of US crude oil has suddenly taken a tumble, dropping below $50 per barrel for the first time since December 2016. Traders are blaming figures, released yesterday, which showed a surge in US crude oil stocks. That caused a 5% drop in the oil price yesterday, and it looks like people are still worried... Brent crude has also fallen, by over 5% to around $52.11 per barrel. Speaking of weak pay.... John Lewis staff have just learned that they\u2019re getting their smallest bonus since the 1950s. Employees will receive an extra three week\u2019s pay, or 6% of basic salary, under its profit-sharing scheme (John Lewis is owner by its workers, or \u2018partners\u2019). Better than a poke with a sharp stick, of course...but it must still be a disappointment to staff at John Lewis\u2019s department stores, and at Waitrose. This is the fifth year running that the bonus has fallen - back in 2011, the bonus was a chunky 18%. Chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield says the retailer needs to retain cash for investment in an increasingly uncertain market. British workers are suffering the worst decade for pay growth since Arthur Wellesley was giving Napoleon Bonaparte a bloody nose at Waterloo. That\u2019s the verdict of the Resolution Foundation, which has crunched the numbers in yesterday\u2019s budget. Director Torsten Bell says: \u201cThe big picture from yesterday\u2019s budget is that the big squeezes on both the public and family finances have been prolonged well into the 2020s. \u201cWhile the Office for Budget Responsibility at least delivered some good news on borrowing, the family finances picture has actually deteriorated since the autumn statement. Britain is set for a return to falling real pay later this year, with this decade now set to be the worst for pay growth since the Napoleonic wars. They\u2019ve also calculated that, on current form, Britain won\u2019t eliminate its deficit until 2025 - 15 years after George Osborne\u2019s first austerity budget. Today\u2019s European Central Bank meeting is also overshadowed by presidential elections in France and the Netherlands. And that\u2019s another reason for the ECB to sit tight today, argues Carsten Brzeski of ING: \u201cWith headline inflation in the euro zone back at the magic 2 percent, the ECB hawks and critics will gradually sense that their moment has come to push for tapering. \u201cIn our view, however, they will not want to add any new uncertainty in the eve of two important elections in the Eurozone.\u201d Several experts are arguing that the European Central Bank should ignore calls to start winding back its stimulus programme. Guntram Wolff of the Bruegel thinktank says underlying inflationary pressures are still too weak: Kathleen Brooks of City Index predicts that the ECB won\u2019t start to dial back its bond-buying programme until the autumn. We seem to have entered a post-inflation era for central bankers, who used to try and prevent price pressures from building. Now we tend to see a willingness for central banks, including the Bank of England, the ECB and, to a smaller extent, the Federal Reserve, to look through periods of high inflation in order to protect growth. Thus, the fact that headline CPI reached 2% is unlikely to deter the ECB from keeping rates in negative territory and maintaining asset purchases, potentially into 2018. We do expect the ECB to revise up its long-term inflation forecast at tomorrow\u2019s meeting, which could trigger some euro buying as the market anticipates a premature end to the ECB\u2019s QE programme. We also don\u2019t expect the ECB to announce any plans to taper its asset purchases any time soon. Firstly, growth in the region remains uneven, for example, the Greek economy contracted sharply at the end of 2016, Finnish growth was flat and Italy could only muster growth of 1%. These are economies that need support from their central bank, and even the German finance minister in a recent speech noted that the ECB was doing a good job to balance policy for all Eurozone members. We think that the ECB is approx. 6-months away from announcing a taper to its QE programme. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale predicts a \u2018straight bat\u2019 from president Draghi: No policy change is expected....Mario Draghi will acknowledge the better economic backdrop and higher inflation, but avoid any watering-down of the dovish bias. It\u2019s two years since the European Central Bank took the plunge and started stimulating the eurozone economy with newly created money. And just look how it\u2019s grown.... European stock markets have opened in the red, as investors await news from the ECB at lunchtime. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is the biggest faller, shedding 44 points or 0.6% to 7289 points. Morrisons is the biggest faller, down 5.5%. It warned this morning that there are uncertainties ahead, including the impact of the weak pound driving up imported food prices. Mining shares are down too. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The European Central Bank\u2019s governing council may have a spring in its step today, as policymakers gather for their latest policy meeting in Frankfurt. After years of low inflation, the consumer prices index is finally back on target at 2% - meaning that fears of a deflationary spiral can be put to bed. But the ECB still has a problem; what to do about its massive stimulus programme that is pumping billions of euros into the eurozone each month? Hawkish members of the ECB will be putting pressure on president Mario Draghi to start the process of winding back its bond-buying QE programme. They\u2019d also like Draghi to signal that the interest rates could rise, having been slashed to record lows of zero (or lower, for banks who leave money in the ECB\u2019s vaults). Here\u2019s the timings: 12.45pm GMT: ECB announce its decision on interest rates and QE 1.30pm GMT: Mario Draghi press conference The markets aren\u2019t expecting any new measures today; but the key, as so often with Draghi, is the language he uses. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explain: The market will be watching for any changes to the ECB\u2019s language today, particularly whether it may drop its current bias toward lower interest rates which would likely be interpreted as a potential signal that the period of ultra-accommodative monetary policy is coming to an end, even if the ECB is still someway from signalling a readiness to raise rates. Our view is that the Governing Council will keep its forward guidance language as is for the time being pointing to the continued weakness of core inflation as justification. The ECB will also issue new staff forecasts on growth and inflation; these are likely to be revised higher. So it\u2019s likely to be a lively day in the currency markets: Also coming up today.... UK chancellor Philip Hammond will be busy defending yesterday\u2019s budget, and the proposed rise in national insurance contributions for the self-employed. Tory MPs aren\u2019t happy about this apparent breach of the government\u2019s manifesto commitments, so it could be a long day for Hammond.... Supermarket chain Wm Morrison, the Co-operative Bank, Domino\u2019s Pizza and estate agent Countrywide are reporting results. The John Lewis chain will be telling its staff the size of their annual bonus. It\u2019s likely to be much smaller than in recent years, which explains why journalists aren\u2019t invited to this year\u2019s event. Finance journalist Simon Neville (and his young apprentice) are disappointed... We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

However, more policy action is less likely because deflation risks have receded. Reading between the lines suggests that the next change from the ECB will be towards removing accommodation and not adding it.<br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Aberdeen Asset Management investment manager Patrick O\u2019Donnell says Draghi has given a small hint that the ECB could adjust its policy stance soon:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cDraghi has ever so slightly opened the door to changing their policy stance. He\u2019s done this by saying that the Governing Council talked about changing the language about where rates are in their monthly statement, but didn\u2019t actually change it. This is effectively him signalling that something might change in the future, just not today.</p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s a classic Draghi technique of saying something that will move markets without actually doing anything. Due to this, and a wordy response to a question about raising rates before QE ends, markets will now start to recalibrate on the assumption that the ECB will remove accommodation towards the end of the year.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jamie Dutta, senior market analyst at Faraday Research, says the ECB president \u201cflip-flopped\u2019 between his bearish opening statement, and some bullish remarks in the press conference.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The ECB and Mario Draghi celebrated its two year anniversary of its Asset Purchase Program by being marginally less dovish than expected in the monthly press conference. It was an interesting balancing act for Draghi between unchanged monetary policy stimulus policies and improved economic prospects. The market took the upgraded forecasts for growth and inflation in its stride.</p> <p>However they reacted more positively when Draghi stated that there was no longer a \u2018sense of urgency on taking further actions\u2019 to boost inflation and the recovery. Indeed Draghi further said the \u2018risks to deflation have largely disappeared\u2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>And<strong> Pictet\u2019s Frederik Ducrozet</strong> shows how the ECB has raised its forecasts for inflation in 2017 and 2018:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/fwred/status/839855085253455874\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">First (and largest revision) to staff forecasts for inflation since June 2015.

Now we tend to see a willingness for central banks, including the Bank of England, the ECB and, to a smaller extent, the Federal Reserve, to look through periods of high inflation in order to protect growth. Thus, the fact that headline CPI reached 2% is unlikely to deter the ECB from keeping rates in negative territory and maintaining asset purchases, potentially into 2018. We do expect the ECB to revise up its long-term inflation forecast at tomorrow\u2019s meeting, which could trigger some euro buying as the market anticipates a premature end to the ECB\u2019s QE programme.</p> <p>We also don\u2019t expect the ECB to announce any plans to taper its asset purchases any time soon. Firstly, growth in the region remains uneven, for example, the Greek economy contracted sharply at the end of 2016, Finnish growth was flat and Italy could only muster growth of 1%. These are economies that need support from their central bank, and even the German finance minister in a recent speech noted that the ECB was doing a good job to balance policy for all Eurozone members.

Our view is that the Governing Council will keep its forward guidance language as is for the time being pointing to the continued weakness of core inflation as justification.</p> </blockquote> <p>The ECB will also issue new staff forecasts on growth and inflation; these are likely to be revised higher.</p> <p><strong>So it\u2019s likely to be a lively day in the currency markets:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/fxsnowball/status/839740597309157376\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Happy ECB day <a href=\"https://twitter.com/50Pips\">@50pips</a><br><br>What colour is your tie? ;-) <a href=\"https://t.co/y7UYxuETsJ\">pic.twitter.com/y7UYxuETsJ</a></p>&mdash; Fxsnowball (@fxsnowball) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fxsnowball/status/839740597309157376\">March 9, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Also coming up today....</h2> <p>UK chancellor Philip Hammond will be busy defending yesterday\u2019s budget, and the proposed rise in national insurance contributions for the self-employed.</p> <p>Tory MPs aren\u2019t happy about this apparent breach of the government\u2019s manifesto commitments, so it could be a long day for Hammond....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/benrileysmith/status/839736247597875200\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Tory MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan says amendment needed to remove NIC rise from Budget.

David Wild, the Domino\u2019s chief executive, said Pizza Hut was \u201cvery aggressive\u201d in January and that consumers were more cautious about spending. \u201cLooking forward, the UK consumer environment is more difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cOur research tells us that customers are worried about rising prices. They\u2019re not worried about job security but they are worried about prices. Over the first nine weeks of the year, sales growth at Domino\u2019s stores open for more than a year dropped to 1.5%, down from 10.5% in the same period a year earlier. Wild added that consumer \u201chave seen things like petrol rise in price, they\u2019re reading in the newspaper that food and energy prices are going up, and they\u2019re factoring that into spending.\u201d He said that Domino\u2019s could gain from that because it \u201csits neatly in the middle\u201d and could gain from customers opting for a takeaway rather than eating out. \u201cThis is a more value-conscious environment,\u201d he added. Family finances are expected to come under increasing pressure in 2017 from rising inflation and weak wage growth. Investors lost their appetite for Domino\u2019s Pizza on Thursday, with shares plunging 16%. Wild played down the large share price fall, saying shares had performed well over the past two weeks. \u201cShare prices go up and down,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to be careful about getting carried away by a very short period, just nine weeks.\u201d City analysts at N+1 Singer said a number of factors were behind the slowdown. \u201cWe understand this reflects a combination of heightened competition from Pizza Hut, market softness and [Domino\u2019s] \u2018winter survival\u2019 promotion campaign being relatively unsuccessful,\u201d they wrote in a research note. Sales growth also slowed over 2016 as a whole, to 7.5% on a like-for-like basis, from 11.7% in 2015. Total sales were up 14.5% at just over \u00a31bn. Wild said the business would continue to grow through expansion both in the UK and abroad. The company expects to open at least 80 new outlets in the UK in 2017, creating up to 3,000 new jobs. Domino\u2019s also announced the purchase of Dolly Dimple\u2019s, Norway\u2019s third largest pizza company, for \u00a34m. Dolly Dimple\u2019s 42 stores will be integrated into Domino\u2019s startup venture in Norway, where it has 12 stores.",

Its annual report for 2016 shows a loss of \u00a3477m \u2013 taking its cumulative losses to \u00a32.6bn \u2013 and spelled out that it would seek \u00a3750m of new capital if it could not find a buyer. Despite its troubles, sparked when a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall was uncovered in 2013, the bank which prides itself on its ethical stance has attracted 4,147 current account customers during the year. The bank\u2019s new management team, led by Liam Coleman, put the bank up for sale last month but is also seeking other ways to find \u00a3750m in new capital by tapping its bond holders and issuing \u00a3300m of new shares. Coleman, who took over at the start of the year and is being paid \u00a31.5m, said: \u201cThis is a great retail bank and one that is valued by our 4m loyal customers. We believe there is opportunity and potential to build on the progress made and on our distinctive ethical position.\u201d He said another 10 branches would need to be closed, on top of the near-200 that have already been shut, taking the network to 95. More job losses are likely although Coleman declined to identify how many were at risk. During its four-year rescue programme the workforce has already halved to 3,895. The bank cannot pay bonuses because of restrictions imposed by the Bank of England while it builds up its financial strength but is paying out \u00a33.6m to staff in a special payment. The losses this year were, in part, caused by the continued restructuring sparked by the deal with Britannia in 2009. There was another \u00a336m provision for payment protection insurance mis-selling, an \u00a382m hit for a mortgage outsourcing deal with Capita and a knock caused by the cut in interest rates by the Bank of England following the vote for Brexit. Dennis Holt, the bank\u2019s chairman, stressed the progress that had been made since 2013, when the bank not only faced severe financial stress but was also hit by the revelations about its former chairman Paul Flowers buying drugs. He said the bank had only been able to put itself up for sale because the \u201cbank is stronger in many areas than in 2013 and these options would simply not have been feasible before\u201d. The Co-operative Group of supermarkets and funeral homes now owns just 20% of the bank after ceding control to hedge funds during the 2013 rescue, which Holt reiterated had taken place without recourse to the taxpayer. Holt would not put a timescale on when a decision needed to be made about selling the bank or injecting fresh capital by forcing bondholders to take losses. Holt said he was \u201cpleased with interest to date\u201d but would not give any further information about a potential sale. The bank has a cost-to-income ratio of 103% \u2013 indicating that it costs more to run than it generates in revenue \u2013 in part because \u201cprior issues\u201d with the turnaround plan put in place by Coleman\u2019s predecessor. The bank is unable to say when it might return to profit. The annual report repeated its warning \u2013 as it has done for the past three years \u2013 \u201cthat there are material uncertainties which may cast significant doubt on the bank\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern\u201d. The bank is meeting the capital requirements set out by international regulators but not the requirement specifically tailored by the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority. Its key measure of strength \u2013 its core tier-1 capital ratio \u2013 fell to 11% from 15.5%. The risk warnings in its annual report said that if it could not achieve its goals \u201cthe Bank of England may impose particular directions or a special resolution procedure\u201d. This special resolution procedure has been put in place since the financial crisis with an aim to avoid taxpayers bailing out troubled banks, requiring bond holders to take losses. The Co-op said the Bank has approved its new IT systems and accepted its new five-year plan which runs until 2021. It includes increasing lending by \u00a31bn each year and also aiming to cut costs from \u00a3445m in 2016 to \u00a3350m a year from 2018, which could indicate further job cuts. The bank is also required to meet the Bank of England\u2019s capital requirements from 2018 when it has signalled it will need to raise a further \u00a3250m though bond issuance. Coleman has waived his entitlement to a long-term incentive plan \u2013 a bonus measured over three years \u2013 of \u00a31.3m. His predecessor, Niall Booker who was brought in during the 2013 crisis, received \u00a32m last year and has bonuses outstanding.",

      "bodyText": "John Lewis has slashed its staff bonus to just 6% of salary, the lowest level since the 1950s, despite a 21% rise in pre-tax profits. The group, which includes department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain, said the bonus was the equivalent of three weeks\u2019 pay and had been cut to retain profits and strengthen its balance sheet. \u201cThis allows us to maintain our level of investment in the face of what we expect to be an increasingly uncertain market this year, while absorbing the costs associated with adapting the partnership for the future,\u201d said Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the group. He added: \u201cThis is absolutely not about slowing down. It is a sign of our determination, of speeding up.\u201d He said that, while staff were likely to be disappointed with the drop in their bonus, it would be met with \u201crealism.\u201d Last year, the staff bonus \u2013 which is the same percentage of salary for all workers, from the chairman to Saturday shelf-fillers \u2013 was 10%, the lowest for 13 years. That meant an average payout of \u00a31,585, compared an average of about \u00a31,031 this year for the 86,700 staff who jointly own the retail group. It is the fourth year in a row that John Lewis has cut the award. It will be the lowest bonus since 1954, when it stood at 4% of pay. This year\u2019s cut in bonus came despite a 21.2% rise in pre-tax profits, before the staff bonus and one-off items, to \u00a3370.4m. Sales rose 3.2% to \u00a311.4bn. Profits were further boosted by one-off income of \u00a3207.2m including \u00a3270m from a reduction in pension liabilities, offset by a \u00a342.9m writedown of property and other assets, and related costs, and a \u00a320.7m charge for restructuring and redundancies. Taking one-off items into account, profits soared by nearly a third to \u00a3577.6m. Mayfield said John Lewis had pumped money into reducing its debts, including its pension deficit, as the economic outlook remained \u201cvolatile and uncertain\u201d because of difficulties in the wider UK economy and in the retail market. He said trading profits at the John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets also owned by the group, excluding a benefit from lower pensions accounting charges, were up just 1.9%. \u201cIn the year ahead, trading pressures will continue as a result of the wider changes taking place in retail. The two major influences are pricing, where the rate of change in selling prices is likely to be significantly slower than the rate of change in input costs as a result of weakness in the sterling exchange rate, and the continued shift from shops to online.\u201d He said he expected cost inflation and competition in the market to intensify this year and the business needed to be prepared. John Lewis and Waitrose have both announced plans to cut hundreds of jobs in recent months as the group continues to cut costs. Mayfield reiterated his view there would be a continued \u201cgradual decline\u201d in staff numbers, as well as a reduction in the use of contractors and consultants. Total staff numbers fell by 3,000 last year and the company said it was looking to make further \u201cproductivity gains\u201d at its head office. Part of that will be driven by robotic automation of some routine head office jobs, such as data input \u2013 something that is already being trialled and is to be expanded this year. Sales at Waitrose rose 2.7% to \u00a36.63bn in the year to 28 January and the company said it increased market share. But operating profit slid 11.3% to \u00a3206.2m and sales in established stores slid 0.2%. Sales at John Lewis rose 4% to \u00a34.74bn, including a strong 2.7% rise at established stores. But all this growth came online, where profits are slimmer, with sales in the department stores down 1%. Operating profits slid 7.5% to \u00a3231.4m. Paula Nickolds, the new managing director of the John Lewis department stores, said home electrical goods had been the best performing product group, driven by new technology including the Dyson Supersonic hairdryer. But she said women\u2019s clothing sales had risen by about 3%, when the rest of the market had seen sales drop by about the same amount.",

      "bodyText": "How much does it cost to make the quarrel over business rates disappear? The answer, Philip Hammond hopes, is \u00a3435m. The figure is the extra relief the chancellor has provided to remove the sharpest edges from a property tax that should have been declared outdated and artless at least a decade ago. Pubs with a rateable value of less than \u00a3100,000 will get a \u00a31,000 discount on their bills. Small businesses that are set to lose their relief will see bills rise by no more than \u00a350 a month. And local authorities can access a \u00a3300m fund to address \u201cindividual hard cases in their local areas\u201d. This package may address many of the cases of looming hardship among small shops and restaurants, especially in the south-east, facing three or fourfold increases in their business rates. But it does little or nothing for those pubs, especially in London, where takings have not soared alongside property prices. Some complained about increases of \u00a310,000 or more. For them, \u00a31,000, even if they qualify for it, will be lost in the slops. What\u2019s a poor chancellor supposed to do, Hammond seemed to complain. Business rates raise \u00a325bn, with the entire sum going to local government by 2020, so he can hardly abolish them overnight, he argued. True, but he could have set out a few hard principles for reform and indicated urgency. His two areas of focus were fine as far as they went, but that wasn\u2019t far. The revaluation process should be \u201csmoother and more frequent\u201d, said Hammond, committing himself to no deadline for reducing the current five-year cycle. Secondly, he said, the government would try to \u201cfind a better way of taxing the digital part of the economy, the part that does not use bricks and mortar\u201d. But Hammond said the goal would be pursued for \u201cthe medium term\u201d, which suggests the government\u2019s thinking has barely begun. Shifting more of the burden of business rates on to online companies would be entirely fair, of course. The retail game, in particular, has been transformed since the turn of the century. It is surely perverse for the taxation system to privilege Amazon\u2019s retail warehouses, built on cheap land with low rental values, over high street shops. The policy may create a few jobs in areas of underinvestment, but the effect is to damage further town centres that have been clobbered by the growth in charmless out-of-town sheds. Simple alternatives are not easy, of course. We already have VAT and corporation tax applies to profit. But ideas for reform are not in short supply. Should business rates try to distinguish between different types of companies, as opposed to seeking to track rental values in mechanical fashion? And is it really right that central government should set a tax that is for the benefit of local authorities? Hammond is a chancellor who tries not to overpromise, so it is still possible that root-and-branch reform, which most of the business world would support, will materialise from his review. But he sounded like a politician who has calculated that the twice-a-decade storm over business rates will blow over eventually and the \u201cmedium term\u201d can mean whatever the government wants it to. An un-Tory tax raid, but rich investors won\u2019t starve If the tax raid on self-employed people seemed very un-Conservative, so did the cut in the tax-free allowance on dividend income enjoyed by wealthy investors in shares. The reduction from \u00a35,000 to \u00a32,000 a year flowed from the chancellor\u2019s ambition to equalise tax payments between self-employed and employed people. The logic is that paying yourself in dividends is an advantage available only to the self-employed, who will often be owners of companies. All the same, the cut in dividend allowance will capture a lot of wealthy investors who, to put it mildly, probably aren\u2019t natural Labour voters. To be affected by the change, an individual would have to own a share portfolio worth more than \u00a350,000, the Treasury calculated, which sounds about right if a 4% dividend yield is assumed. It would be hard, though, to summon too much sympathy for these investors. Tax-free ISAs, or individual savings accounts, have been around for years and if wealthy savers weren\u2019t putting in the maximum every time, they weren\u2019t paying attention. Meanwhile, the annual ISA allowance is about to be raised to \u00a320,000. Rich investors won\u2019t starve and, one suspects, few Tory votes will be lost.",

      "bodyText": "When shop owners in the seaside town of Southwold warn of the \u201ctragic\u201d and \u201ccatastrophic\u201d consequences of steep increases in business rates, it is tempting to assume that their campaigning zeal might be nudging them towards hyperbole. But fuelling this powerful, coordinated local protest is a real, widely-shared fear that a projected increase of 177% in business rates could ruin the town permanently. There was only muted relief among shop owners on Wednesday in response to the announcement by Philip Hammond of some interim softening of proposed rates rises, which removed the immediate prospect of huge new bills from the small businesses along the high street. There was no celebration because the longer term threat to the survival of the town\u2019s independent businesses has not been removed. Southwold is well-known for its multi-coloured beach huts, lighthouse, pier and bowling greens; less so, until now, for its political activism. When the town realised that it was the place worst hit in the country by proposed business rate rises, shopkeepers launched a poster campaign forcing customers to confront the potential impact, if the increase was passed in full onto them. Most shop doors in the town carry a sign informing customers of the percentage rise they face in rates, and appealing for their help in petitioning parliament. On the door of one of the town\u2019s bakers, customers are told: \u201cIf we were to raise our prices by 177% a sausage roll would go from \u00a32.95 to \u00a38.17.\u201d The owners of Chapmans, the newsagents \u2013 facing a 400% rise in rates, calculated they would have to sell newspapers at \u00a38 a copy, if they were to recoup the increase. Customers were urged to write to their Conservative MP, Therese Coffey \u2013 who represents Suffolk Coastal. The campaign, and parallel protests in a handful of other towns around the country, appeared to have had something of an impact. The vast majority of shops on Southwold high street were previously classified as small businesses but had been reclassified under the new regime that is due to begin in April, because business rates are calculated as a proportion of rental value, which has soared since the last valuation seven years ago. Hammond\u2019s budget measures promised to stave off the looming crisis for Southwold \u2013 at least temporarily. But businesses were left feeling very fragile and concerned about the longer term rate rises. Will Windell, town councillor and chair of the planning and development committee, said the budget had done nothing to tackle Southwold\u2019s core problems. \u201cIn the summer when the roads are full of 4x4s, Southwold is seen as a rich town,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not at all rich.\u201d He added that at the turn of the century, two-thirds of the houses in Southwold were occupied by local residents; 17 years later, the balance has shifted so that now 57% of properties in the town are holiday lets or second homes. \u201cProperty skyrocketed around 2010,\u201d Windell said. \u201cWe have a very elderly population so when the houses get sold the prices are so high that young locals can\u2019t buy them. 52% of Southwold are retired; the amount of people working full time is just 28%. The older people might be asset rich, but they don\u2019t have much money.\u201d Southwold has one of the highest levels of children on free school meals in the region. In the past five years, several chain stores, from Costa Coffee to Jack Wills have opened on the high street, helping to push up retail rents. \u201cA feeling of unfairness permeated the whole town. It has been hugely demoralising. The money that goes into the big brands goes straight out,\u201d Windell said. As a result of the town\u2019s campaigning, Coffey met the chancellor in February to raise the issue on behalf of Southwold\u2019s independent retailers; the intervention has had some impact but not enough to resolve the problem. Southwold\u2019s mayor Melanie Tucker said it was not clear how much the transitional measures would help. \u201cIt is welcome that there is some relief, but the devil is in the detail,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cWe only know that it will help initially.\u201d Butchers Charlie Mills, who has been running the butchers Mills and Sons for the past three and a half years, says he does not expect to get any support when his rates rises from \u00a37,000 to about \u00a315,000. \u201cIt is unsustainable,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a risk that we will have to close unless we can find a magic way of generating an extra \u00a38,000 of profit.\u201d In the past five years chains have arrived, and commercial property developers began demanding unheard of rents. \u201cI don\u2019t have much confidence in the council discretionary pot; that \u00a3300m pot has to go around the country,\u201d he adds. \u201cI don\u2019t think the chancellor has given us anything to celebrate.\u201d There has been a butchers on the same site since 1684, but Mills thinks he may have to move to out of Southwold to somewhere cheaper. Newsagents Clare Hart, from Chapmans newsagents, said her shop, which has been operating on the site since 1897, also faced closure despite the chancellor\u2019s transitional measures. Currently she pays \u00a32,000 a year in business rates; over five years she will have to pay an extra \u00a39,000, bringing the rates to \u00a311,200. \u201cI calculated we would have to generate an extra \u00a350,000 a year in sales to cover it,\u201d says Hart. \u201cWe would like to think that we could keep it going but I don\u2019t know how you would increase sales to that extent. If shops like us close it will be catastrophic for the town.\u201d Greengrocers Tracy Brown has run Crab Apple greengrocers for the past eight years. She says the rates for her shop were set to increase by 173% to \u00a314,000. She was unimpressed by the measures announced by the chancellor. \u201cWe are a small shop selling low-value product; it is ludicrous that we are no longer considered a small business,\u201d she says. \u201cWe would have to sell a lot more to cover it and the the margins on vegetables are very small. \u201cIt is all the traditional shops \u2013 the butchers, the bakers, the greengrocers, the old-fashioned and small shops that can\u2019t afford to stay. If they go, the town will just be chains \u2013 which would be sad for Southwold.\u201d Pharmacy Jane Patel has been co-owner of Queen Street Pharmacy for the past 33 years. Until now it has qualified as a small business but after the revaluation its annual rates of \u00a34,600 are estimated to rise to around \u00a314,600. She was relieved that the full impact would not be felt immediately but uncertain about the longer term future of the business. \u201cWe are going to try to keep going; luckily we own the building,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have been here this long, we aren\u2019t going to give up easily. We are a community asset; if we went there would be no pharmacy.\u201d Post Office Sarah Green, who runs Spots \u2013 which incorporates Southwold\u2019s post office \u2013 said the new rates regime would have a devastating effect on the town, regardless of the interim measures. \u201cI think it really will be quite devastating,\u201d she argues. \u201cThe town\u2019s post office is very important for the community. We will see an 81% increase \u2013 not the highest in Southwold but it is the equivalent to a part-time salary or a \u00a36,000 drop in income. There\u2019s always been a post office on that site for at least 100 years. We don\u2019t want be scaremongering, and start telling people that they are going to lose their local Post Office but I don\u2019t know if it will be sustainable; my husband and I already work a six day and sometimes a seven day week.\u201d Craft co-operatives Craftco \u2013 a contemporary craft co-operative selling jewellery, pottery and prints where Julie Carpenter is one of 10 co-directors, was set to see its rates increase from \u00a3152 a year this year to around \u00a35,600 after five years. This increase has been deferred, but the long-term future of the business is still under threat. \u201cWe will be put out of business; 80 crafts people will lose an important outlet for their work and livelihood,\u201d she says. \u201cAll our customers say that one reason they come to Southwold is for the independent shops. If these rate rises go ahead the community aspects of the town will be devastated.\u201d Cafes Alison Boucher, who opened Cafe51 four years ago, said: \u201cIt is great news in that the government obviously realises that something is wrong with the system, but the higher payments have just been postponed.\u201d In the longer term, however she was uncertain that the business will survive. The cafe is currently paying about \u00a33,000 in business rates, and this will increase to \u00a310,000 over the next five years. \u201cIt will become a non-viable business,\u201d she says. \u201cIt would eat into our profits considerably and we already do an 80-hour week. If the rise goes ahead we won\u2019t be here in five years. It is really sad; I love running this place \u2013 it is a great business, and we have lots of local trade. I don\u2019t think people are overstating the case to stay that it would be disastrous for Southwold.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Parcel delivery firms DPD and Parcelforce Worldwide could be called before a parliamentary committee to answer questions about the working conditions faced by their self-employed couriers. Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the work and pensions select committee, has written to the bosses of both companies asking them to contribute to an ongoing inquiry into the gig economy, after the Guardian revealed drivers were charged up to \u00a3250 if they could not provide cover when they were ill. Field set the companies a deadline of 20 March to provide details of their contracts with \u201cowner-driver\u201d couriers. Owner-drivers are not directly employed by the company and must fund their own vehicle, fuel, insurance and uniform in return for payment per delivery. Owner-drivers have a contract to deliver in a specified area and must pay for the cost of finding a replacement if they are off sick and do not provide an alternative courier themselves. \u201cThe owner-driver approach creates the opportunity of greater financial returns for the owner-driver,\u201d a spokesperson for Parcelforce said. \u201cLike any other business, however, the owner-driver is responsible for that business, rather than being an employee.\u201d Earlier this week Field said the charges appeared to be part of a \u201cbidding war, to see who can slap the biggest penalty on workers who are sick\u201d. Field has asked companies to explain the policy, including the legal basis of charging owner-drivers for taking the day off due to illness. He asked them to calculate how much couriers could expect to lose out on when sick, including lost earnings. Parcelforce Worldwide\u2019s managing director, Gary Simpson, and DPD\u2019s UK chief executive, Dwain McDonald, were also told to supply a copy of the contract governing self-employed couriers. They were asked to provide data on the number of times courier rounds are covered by a substitute driver and how often each company has to source a replacement because the owner-driver is unable to do so. Field asked them to detail the costs couriers are expected to meet themselves, such as uniform and fuel, as well as data on their average hourly rate and information about what efforts the companies go to to ensure owner-drivers are earning the \u201cnational living wage\u201d. Further information requested includes the hours couriers work per week and how long they have worked for the company. Couriers have become a focal point of concerns about the precarious nature of employment in the gig economy, which is the subject of a review commissioned by Theresa May and led by former Tony Blair adviser Matthew Taylor. Earlier this week, couriers who carry blood supplies and passports kicked off two new challenges to the gig economy. Five cyclists, motorcyclists and van drivers carrying emergency blood supplies to hospitals and samples to laboratories launched a claim against the Doctors Laboratory challenging their self-employed status, in the first gig economy test case to hit the healthcare sector. More than 20 van drivers working for DX, an Aim-listed courier firm which works for Amazon, the US embassy and dozens of other clients, began legal action questioning their employment status. Speaking on Tuesday at the first hearing into the future world of work by the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee, Hannah Reed, a senior policy officer at the Trades Union Congress, said: \u201cThere should be a floor of rights for all working people \u2013 a single worker definition.\u201d Sue Tumelty, the founder and managing director of consultancy HR Dept, said: \u201cI would like the \u2018worker\u2019 category to go.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Brexit, airlines' worst fear, has become their preoccupation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There is no shortage of metaphors for what airlines expect from Brexit: analysts talk of crosswinds, executives fear turbulence. For some, it is simply flying into thick fog with no idea where they are going to land. No airline wanted Britain to vote leave in last year\u2019s referendum; easyJet and Ryanair campaigned against it. A single European market in aviation brought cheap flights spanning the continent, ever more passengers, trade and jobs. Why would they jeopardise that? Now, Brexit is a huge preoccupation for airlines operating in and out of the UK \u2013 and airports, whose health is largely contingent on the success of short-haul European travel. Most obviously affected are the British low-cost airline easyJet and Dublin-based Ryanair, whose main market is the UK. Their share prices were hammered by the referendum: easyJet\u2019s dropped by a third, wiping \u00a32bn off its value in four days. They face, at the least, uncertainty, bureaucratic headaches and a runway of costly red tape. The worst-case scenario of planes unable to fly between Britain and Europe is one that few foresee. But the legal framework underpinning international flights, wrapped up in EU membership, is set to disappear. Dame Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet, says: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. We are spending a lot of time working with the commission and the government to say we believe a liberal and deregulated aviation market is in the interest of every single aviation passenger in Europe.\u201d Airlines have argued that aviation is a special case. According to Brussels, that is deeply wishful thinking. The EU\u2019s highest-ranking mandarin for transport, Henrik Hololei, told the Guardian: \u201cThere will be no separate deal.\u201d First comes a general Brexit deal, said Hololei, EU director-general for transport and mobility \u2013 one that could well limit the freedom of airlines to operate in and out of the UK. Brexit would \u201cwithout doubt, have consequences\u201d for airlines, he added. \u201cThey need to get a contingency plan.\u201d Concerns include landing rights, operating licences and ownership rules. Prior to the EU and deregulation of the skies, landing rights were negotiated between individual states \u2013 treaties allocating airlines to specific airports. About 85% of Britain\u2019s international air traffic is currently governed by EU-wide agreements, including flights to Europe and North America, allowing open access for airlines. Those rights include the freedom for airlines to fly between, and within, other countries in Europe: for easyJet to operate between Nice and Nantes in France, for example, or for Ryanair to fly from Stansted to Glasgow. EU membership may not be essential: members of the European Common Aviation Area include Norway and Balkan states, and Norwegian has become the third largest budget carrier on the continent. But obtaining similar conditions after Brexit is far from assured. EasyJet is pursuing air operating licences from other countries to keep its intra-EU network running, a \u00a310m insurance policy. Yet it will be powerless to assure future flights between Britain and the EU can operate as usual without governmental agreement. A further headache once Britain leaves the EU could be ownership rules that limit foreign shareholders to a minority stake: under the Chicago convention underpinning international airline treaties, operators must be majority-owned by the government or nationals of their home territory \u2013 currently the whole EU. But once Britain leaves the EU, Ryanair will find 20% more of its shareholders classed as foreign, and may require some to sell. EasyJet may be thankful that its main shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, has dual British\u2013Cypriot citizenship, allowing the airline to easily reach the 50% shareholding threshold it will need to be classed as either British or EU-owned. Some suggest that International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways, could run into red tape; but IAG\u2019s chief executive, Willie Walsh, insists that the group\u2019s structures, dating from the merger of BA and the Spanish airline Iberia in 2011, are Brexit-proof. If cross-border issues are costly irritations to individual airlines, the bigger picture for Britain is more concerning. The Airport Operators Association warns: \u201cIf there is no agreement by the time the UK leaves the EU, the UK\u2019s connectivity will be undermined and its ability to trade will be made significantly more difficult.\u201d Daily flight schedules that now start and end in Britain with business-friendly departure times may become less likely should, for example, easyJet have to shift increasing parts of its operations to bases within the EU. Ryanair has already said it will now grow its business in other EU countries rather than Britain. Then there is the impact of the Brexit vote on passenger numbers. The slumping pound makes it harder for Britons to afford a foreign holiday, but easyJet puzzles over why it has not, conversely, lured in Europeans for a cheap break. \u201cWhat we\u2019re really worried about is what it\u2019s doing to demand,\u201d says Sophie Dekkers, UK director of easyJet. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen any significant increase in inbound passengers. It\u2019s only a hypothesis, but it could be a feeling after the referendum they\u2019ve been rejected \u2013 that Britain is not making them feel welcome.\u201d Falling demand will make routes unviable, she says. That decline would be swiftly exacerbated should Brexit talks end with passengers needing visas. Paperwork swiftly deters leisure travellers, as easyJet found when tighter immigration rules killed off flights from the UK to Moscow that it had battled to secure. The British government says it will continue to work closely with the industry, adding that it is in the interests of all European countries to maintain open air links \u2013 with British passengers vital, for example, for Dutch long-haul flights and Spanish tourism. A spokesman said: \u201cThe UK aviation industry is the largest in Europe, handling over 250 million passengers and 2.3m tonnes of cargo last year, benefiting both consumers and business in the EU and the UK. \u201cIt will clearly be in the interests of both sides in the negotiation to maintain closely integrated aviation markets.\u201d But that view is not necessarily shared abroad. One well-placed industry source notes: \u201cOther governments will have airlines in their ear \u2013 upcoming low-cost airlines as well as legacy carriers \u2013 whispering that they see a lot of commercial, competitive advantages in keeping the UK out.\u201d One executive does not discount the European commission\u2019s warning. Michael O\u2019Leary, chief executive of Ryanair \u2013 who campaigned in vain against what he calls \u201cthe stupidest decision the Brits have ever made\u201d \u2013 says: \u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be another arrangement. There\u2019s a real prospect that the UK will be dumped out.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest OECD world outlook released on Tuesday highlights that while the world economy is beholden to the risks of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency and Brexit; the concern in Australia is housing prices and the need to ready ourselves once again for a time when the Reserve Bank increases interest rates. Risk is a big issue for the OECD. The latest update of its outlook has thrown off somewhat the gloomy tone of the financial crisis years, but it has hardly adopted a giddy disposition. The headline is one of concern overshadowing (limited) joy: \u201cWill risks derail the modest recovery?\u201d Across the OECD, 2017 and 2018 look to be better than the post-GFC years of 2011 to 2015. The big exception is the UK, which the OECD sees achieving GDP growth of just 1.0% next year due to Brexit uncertainty and the impact of rising inflation. For Australia, the OECD\u2019s outlook is similar to that of the Reserve Bank\u2019s, with GDP growth improving in 2018 to 3.1%: But the risks to this growth remain prominent in the minds of the OECD boffins. The subtitle of the update is \u201cFinancial vulnerabilities and policy risks\u201d. The policy risks most acute are those of the Brexit and the Trump administration. While the report does not name Trump, there is little doubt who is at the forefront of their minds when it notes that \u201cthere is significant uncertainty about the future direction of trade policy globally, in part because of falling public support for trade in advanced countries connected to disparities in outcomes across industries, workers and regions.\u201d It also notes that \u201cfalling trust in national governments and lower confidence by voters in the political systems of many countries can make it more difficult for governments to pursue and sustain the policy agenda required to achieve strong and inclusive growth.\u201d But while these issues affect Australia as well, for the most part the risk the OECD applies to Australia relates not so much to policy but to financial vulnerabilities. Last week, the OECD\u2019s report on Australia highlighted the concern over a housing price crash, and again in this OECD-wide report, the issue is given specific attention. Generally Australia doesn\u2019t feature much in such reports, and so it is significant that the only mention made of our economy is when it notes that \u201csome countries have experienced rapid house price increases in recent years, including Australia, Canada, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\u201d Rather pointedly it notes that \u201cpast experience has shown, a rapid rise of house prices can be a precursor of an economic downturn\u201d. But the issue is not just that house prices may fall and with it people\u2019s incomes, it is that people in Australia are much more in debt than they once were \u2013 and thus moves to dampen house prices through increased interest rates will have a sharp impact on consumer spending and people\u2019s likeliness to default. Across the OECD, the report notes that \u201calthough there has been a slower accumulation of household debt in recent years, mortgage-debt-to-income ratios remain high in many countries\u201d. In Australia it is not just high but record high. Housing debt is now equivalent to 132.2% of household annual disposable income \u2013 well above the pre-GFC peak of 113.1% in September 2008. And that point is important because that was when Australian households were paying a record amount of their disposable income on mortgage interest repayments. At 11% of quarterly disposable income it remains well above the current level of 6.8%: The reason that we are currently paying less in interest despite having higher levels of debt is, of course, because interest rates are much lower now. And that is where the big risk from both the policy uncertainty and financial vulnerabilities nicely merge. Since the election of Donald Trump the general view has been that inflation across the world is set to increase. This mostly comes from a belief that Trump is more likely to provide stimulus to the US economy than would have Hillary Clinton \u2013 first, because Trump promised such policies and, second, because the Republican party in Congress, which could limit such spending, only cares about the budget deficit when the president is a Democrat. As a result, the interest rate (or yield) for government bonds both in the USA and in Australia has risen: This matters not just because of the increased costs to our government to borrow money, but because the rates of government bonds do not stray too far away from the level of the cash rate: The increase of the rate of two-year Australian government bonds from a low of 1.41% in August to now 33 basis points above the cash rate at 1.83% suggests the market is anticipating a rise in the cash rate over that time. Indeed, the market is now fully pricing in a rise to 1.75% by June next year: Some banks are already predicting a rate rise to occur this year. The RBA in its statement on Tuesday certainly gave no indication that this will occur. Mostly its language was the same as in February. Certainly the bank was no more bullish about the economy than it was with its rather optimistic outlook in February. In February, it said that \u201cgrowth in full-time employment turned positive late in 2016.\u201d On Tuesday, the language had been changed to strike a slightly more cautious note: \u201cthe unemployment rate has been steady at around 5\u00be per cent over the past year, with employment growth concentrated in part-time jobs\u201d. But the OECD certainly is sounding the warning that the RBA needs to act. As I noted in January, the latest housing finance data suggests prices will continue to pick up over the next six months. It has now been a record 76 months since the RBA last increased interest rates. And with our current record levels of debt, any rise going to have a much greater impact than in the past. But while the bank will be concerned about the impact of a rate rise of consumer spending, the signs are that this period of no rate rises will end sooner rather than later.",

The big exception is the UK, which the OECD sees achieving GDP growth of just 1.0% next year due to Brexit uncertainty and the impact of rising inflation.</p> <p>For Australia, the OECD\u2019s outlook is similar to that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/grogonomics/2017/feb/09/the-reserve-bank-puts-on-its-rose-coloured-glasses-with-interest-rate-decision\">the Reserve Bank</a>\u2019s, with GDP growth improving in 2018 to 3.1%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual real GDP growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LGS3d/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> But the risks to this growth remain prominent in the minds of the OECD boffins. The subtitle of the update is \u201cFinancial vulnerabilities and policy risks\u201d. The policy risks most acute are those of the Brexit and the Trump administration.</p> <p>While the report does not name Trump, there is little doubt who is at the forefront of their minds when it notes that \u201cthere is significant uncertainty about the future direction of trade policy globally, in part because of falling public support for trade in advanced countries connected to disparities in outcomes across industries, workers and regions.\u201d</p> <p>It also notes that \u201cfalling trust in national governments and lower confidence by voters in the political systems of many countries can make it more difficult for governments to pursue and sustain the policy agenda required to achieve strong and inclusive growth.\u201d</p> <p>But while these issues affect Australia as well, for the most part the risk the OECD applies to Australia relates not so much to policy but to financial vulnerabilities.</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/03/australian-housing-market-crash-could-lead-to-broader-downturn-oecd-warns\">the OECD\u2019s report on Australia</a> highlighted the concern over a housing price crash, and again in this OECD-wide report, the issue is given specific attention.</p> <p>Generally Australia doesn\u2019t feature much in such reports, and so it is significant that the only mention made of our economy is when it notes that \u201csome countries have experienced rapid house price increases in recent years, including Australia, Canada, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\u201d Rather pointedly it notes that \u201cpast experience has shown, a rapid rise of house prices can be a precursor of an economic downturn\u201d.</p> <p>But the issue is not just that house prices may fall and with it people\u2019s incomes, it is that people in Australia are much more in debt than they once were \u2013 and thus moves to dampen house prices through increased interest rates will have a sharp impact on consumer spending and people\u2019s likeliness to default.</p> <p> Across the OECD, the report notes that \u201calthough there has been a slower accumulation of household debt in recent years, mortgage-debt-to-income ratios remain high in many countries\u201d.</p> <p>In Australia it is not just high but record high. Housing debt is now equivalent to 132.2% of household annual disposable income \u2013 well above the pre-GFC peak of 113.1% in September 2008.</p> <p>And that point is important because that was when Australian households were paying a record amount of their disposable income on mortgage interest repayments. At 11% of quarterly disposable income it remains well above the current level of 6.8%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Housing debt and interest payments\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LoYpD/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> The reason that we are currently paying less in interest despite having higher levels of debt is, of course, because interest rates are much lower now. And that is where the big risk from both the policy uncertainty and financial vulnerabilities nicely merge.</p> <p>Since the election of Donald Trump the general view has been that inflation across the world is set to increase.
