      "bodyText": "Back in Brussels, our Europe editor Ian Traynor reports that the Greek PM got a harsh reception when he asked fellow leaders for support in the ongoing debt talks: And Britain\u2019s PM made his case for reform, although perhaps not for very long... Greece makes the front pages again: Another sign of optimism: Alexis Papachelas, probably Greece\u2019s best informed political analyst, has told SKAI News that he thinks \u201can agreement is very close, very near.\u201d \u201cThere is a detectable shift in stance. Under pressure lenders have retreated on several issues,\u201d Syriza\u2019s prominent MEP, Dimitris Papadimoulis told the Guardian. \u201cWe are beginning to see that differences are bridgeable, that an agreement will be reached.\u201d Echoing the German chancellor Angela Merkel, insiders in the leftist led Syriza government said it was vital that Greece cut a deal with the bodies keeping it afloat before markets opened on Monday. The optimism \u2013 the first real sign of a thaw in relations between Athens and its creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF \u2013 followed extraordinary scenes of brinkmanship in Brussels and outbursts of fury in Athens Earlier in the day, Papadimoulis, a Syriza moderate, had denounced the tactics of hardliners in the EU and IMF who, he claimed, were deliberately thwarting an agreement with prime minister Alexis Tsipras. A spot of optimism: Over in Athens, Greeks who are far to the left of the ruling Syriza party, have pledged to step up protests against the government over concessions it appears willing to make to cut a deal. Some of the thousands who marched through the streets of Athens tonight belong to the ultra radical anti-capitalist Antarsia group, a collection of far far left groups that make Syriza look centrist. Holding banners demanding that Greece leaves the European Union and writes off its monument debt, protestors gathered at Athens university campus before marching on parliament. The radicals, who are gaining in popularity and may well prove to be a headache for the government, have pledged to step up protests and strikes in the event that Tsipras reaches a deal with the EU, ECB and IMF that they have already denounced as a \u201cnew memorandum.\u201d Seamen aligned with the group have announced they will go on strike on Tuesday and said they will bring all ships/ferries to a grinding halt on the 1 and 2nd of July. If a deal is reached, activists say they want to stop it being brought before the 300-seat House where creditors have demanded it be ratified. \u201cIf it is signed and passed by parliament we will stage protests and strikes to ensure it is not put into effect,\u201d Stamatis Hadzidimou, an activist with the socialist workers\u2019 party, told me. \u201cIf it is not passed and the country goes bust, we will also stage protests and strikes to ensure that capitalists don\u2019t start closing enterprises and laying off people. There is going to be unrest.\u201d More on that Tsipras-Tusk clash: Some intriguing reports coming out of Brussels, where leaders have discussed Greece\u2019s bailout. According to a Greek official, Tsipras told leaders they must respect January\u2019s election result..... And was then challenged by Donald Tusk: Tsipras\u2019s call for another leaders\u2019 meeting is being rebuffed too.... Costas Lapavitsas, a Syriza MP, has made a new call for Greece to break away from the Eurozone, following the rejection of Athens\u2019 compromise proposal. Writing in the Guardian, Lapavistas said an influential group of Syriza\u2019s MPs would soon make an \u201cintervention\u201d: Could be another lively evening in Athens too: So, where do we stand in the Greek crisis? Greece and its creditors are still divided, with less than six days until its bailout programme expires. Another of frenzied diplomatic activity, starting at dawn, has again failed to reach agreement on the economic measures Greece must take to obtain \u20ac7.2bn of bailout funds before Wednesday morning. Talks between Alexis Tsipras, Christine Lagarde, Mario Draghi and Jean-Claude Juncker foundered again this morning, after the quartet had already talked past midnight. That prompted the creditors to slap Tsipras with an ultimatum, and then draw up their own new proposal, which gave some ground on pension reforms and VAT, but still crosses some of Athens\u2019 Red Lines. [see the full leak and early reaction here] It wasn\u2019t good enough for the Greek side, which swiftly produced its own counter-proposal. The resulting mash-up was discussed by eurozone finance ministers at their fourth gathering in a week (photos here), but they couldn\u2019t find common ground. Their meeting broke up this afternoon, dashing any lingering hopes of a deal tonight. And according to Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, some finance ministers aren\u2019t happy with the latest proposal from creditors. So the issue is currently sitting in the lap of EU leaders, at their summit tonight. Leaders are officially discussing Europe\u2019s migration crisis, and Britain\u2019s reform demands, but the Greece issue will surely be aired? Alexis Tsipras, indeed, is pushing for a eurozone leaders summit tonight: Going into the summit, Tsipras told reporters that there will be a compromise, but one based on HIS proposals: So after the comprehensive Greek proposals, I am confident that we will reach a compromise that will help the eurozone and Greece to overcome the crisis. And Donald Tusk also put on his best brave face, saying: The last hours have been really critical, but I have a good hunch that unlike in Sophocles\u2019 tragedies, this Greek story will have a happy ending. But right now, Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem sounds downbeat. Here\u2019s his statement: The Eurogroup has finished. The institutions informed us about their intensive negotiations with the Greek government. We agreed that they will do an assessment of the last Greek proposals, because they came in very late today, just before the Eurogroup meeting. The institutions informed us that on a number of issues there is still a wide gap with the Greek authorities. In the meantime, the door is still open for the Greek authorities to accept the proposals tabled by the institutions. Now, I will inform the Heads of State or Government on the state of play. The Eurogroup will probably reconvene on Saturday to take stock of the situation. But with a series of Greek MPs slamming the creditors and refusing to be \u201cblackmailed\u201d, it isn\u2019t easy to see how Tsipras could push the institutions\u2019 plan through the Athens parliament.... An anti-austerity demonstration is taking place outside the Commission now, in another sign that tensions are building around the Greek crisis. That\u2019s via AFP\u2019s Danny Kemp: How did today\u2019s deadlock rock the markets? Well, it didn\u2019t. The Athens exchange finished the day ever-so-slightly higher, up 0.1%. And the main European markets were fairly calm too: That\u2019s partly because traders believe a deal will be done....and partly because they (like the rest of you?) are weary of the whole process. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct captures the mood: My dad had a Ford Cortina back in the 1980s which was perennially in the garage having something or other done to it in an attempt cure one of its many ailments, yet while it chugged along, stalled and broke down on many times it did so on fewer occasions than Greece\u2019s current debt bailout talks. And as European leaders headed in and out of yet another summit it seems that deal is looking as far away as ever. Our Europe editor hears that if the Eurogroup meet on Saturday morning, and if they agree a deal, then the Greek parliament could then begin debating it on the Sunday. And if Athens MPs do sign up to the plan (not a given), then the Bundestag could give its approval early next week too. But what about \u20ac1.6bn IMF repayment that Greece faces on Tuesday? Well, Ian reports, that could be paid out of the profits which the ECB has made on its Greek bond holdings. There\u2019s a sudden flurry of activity in the Commission as Yanis Varoufakis appears in the press area, apparently after briefing Alexis Tsipras about the eurogroup meeting. Reporters flock around the finance minister, like moths to a particularly bright candle: There are VIP exits, Yanis! (maybe he should brush up on the special badge system) And here\u2019s a reminder of how we got to this point: If you look carefully at photos from today\u2019s European Council summit you can see that the leaders are wearing little pins. They\u2019re the pinnacle of an extremely complicated hierarchy that determine who can go where on these occasions. My colleagues Alberto Nardelli and George Arnett explain: If you\u2019re lucky enough to have gold, and thus access to the 80th floor, there\u2019s the VIP dinner \u2013 one feature of which is that there is no note-taking. A tighter confidentiality regime applies on this floor of the building, and this is where, on Thursday evening, Cameron will lay out his plans for renegotiating the terms of Britain\u2019s membership of the EU. Ambassadors and their \u201cantici\u201d (jargon for powerful assistant and scribe) have red badges. One peculiarity of the Euco system is that note-taking during meetings often takes place in a separate room. A level below these are the blue and grey badges used by delegation members and admin personnel. They spend most of their time on the \u201c50th floor\u201d, which includes meeting rooms, delegation rooms and the presidency room. After that it gets more complicated. Alongside the regular badges each country delegation also gets a number of floaters. These work like the \u201cpower-up mushroom\u201d in Super Mario Bros: participants with a floater are temporarily of bigger status until the floater is taken away from them..... Learn more here (including why there isn\u2019t really an 80th floor) Greece\u2019s PM is pushing for eurozone leaders to hold a summit this evening, reports the FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel. Which is a good excuse to drop these pictures in, from today\u2019s summit meeting: Reuters has now published the full quotes from Yanis Varoufakis as he left the eurogroup. And he reveals that some euro finance ministers refused to support the latest offer from the IMF/ECB/EC today (which included some concessions to Athens) Varoufakis said: \u201cInterestingly, several colleagues disagreed and criticised not only our text but also the text of the institutions.\u201d \u201cWe shall continue our deliberations, the institutions are going to look again at the two documents - our documents and their own, there will be discussions with the Greek government, and we\u2019ll continue until we find a solution\u201d It\u2019s the same old, same old story. Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner, has said that there is still no agreement on the pension reforms and VAT rate changes that Greece should implement. EU\u2019S MOSCOVICI SAYS VAT, PENSIONS REMAIN STICKING POINTS IN DISCUSSIONS WITH GREECE EU\u2019S MOSCOVICI SAYS STILL DISCUSSING HOW TO REACH GREECE\u2019S FISCAL TARGETS Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, is telling the press pack that discussions will continue, and hinted that there was much disagreement at today\u2019s meeting. GREEK FINANCE MINISTER SAYS THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS OF TWO DOCUMENTS, LOTS OF COLLEAGUES CRITICIZED OUR TEXT AND THAT OF CREDITORS GREEK FINANCE MINISTER SAYS WE WILL CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS UNTIL WE FIND A SOLUTION Jeroen Dijsselbloem, Eurogroup president, has told reporters in Brussels that the door is still open for Greece to accept the proposals tabled by its creditors today (see earlier). Eurozone finance ministers have agreed to meet again in two days time - they must be sick of the sight of each other. It\u2019s official: The meeting of eurozone finance ministers has ended without a deal (that\u2019s via Finland\u2019s fast-tweeting finance minister) So what happens next? We could be looking at another eurogroup meeting on Saturday morning.... Several Brussels reporters are reporting that the \u201cindefinitely suspended\u201d Eurogroup meeting resumed a few minutes ago, and then broke up again. Classic. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, reports that leaders are very keen to avoid another emergency summit on Greece (they\u2019ve already held one this week, back on Monday). But that relies on finance ministers reaching a deal on their own. Ireland\u2019s Enda Kenny predicts a long weekend ahead of us: Once inside the commission, Alexis Tsipras has held some intense-looking chats with Martin Schulz, president of the European parliament.... ...and Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi. Alexis Tsipras actually teased a reporter as he arrived in Brussels for tonight\u2019s Summit. Asked \u201cWhat\u2019s going on\u201d, he replied \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You don\u2019t know?\u201d (\u201cNo, we don\u2019t\u201d, the reporter shot back). The Greek PM then predicted a deal, saying: European history is full of disagreements, negotiations, and then compromises. So after the comprehensive Greek proposals, I am confident that we will reach a compromise that will help the eurozone and Greece to overcome the crisis. Do you have a basis for agreement? Yes, it is a basis, a good basis, Tsipras replies. He declined to be drawn on Britain\u2019s In-Out referendum. Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras tells reporters that he\u2019s confident a deal will be reached, as he arrives at the European council summit. After all, arguments and compromises are what Europe\u2019s all about. As finance ministers scramble for the Eurogroup exits, Francois Hollande has arrived at the EU Summit. Speaking in French, the president states twice that an Greek agreement is possible, and necessary. But it\u2019s up to the negotiating teams to work it out. Eurozone ministers have told Greece to come back with a better set of proposals -- in the meantime, their meeting is \u2018indefinitely suspended\u2019 NEWSFLASH: Eurozone finance minister have just taken a break from their Eurogroup meeting. And an EU official has told Bloomberg that there is no sign of an agreement, after around two hours discussing the latest proposal from Greece\u2019s creditors (see earlier leak) and Greece\u2019s counter-proposal. Angela Merkel does not appear to share Donald Tusk\u2019s optimism of a happy ending. Arriving at the EU summit, she tells reporters that she has the impression that Greece has \u201cgone backwards\u201d on some issues\u201d -- but in any event it\u2019s up to finance ministers at the Eurogroup meeting today to decide. My colleague Sean Clarke has created a really handy interactive, showing the main issues which Greece and its creditors are still arguing over today (it\u2019s updated to reflect today\u2019s proposals) The endless to-and-froing over Greece\u2019s bailout programme has been dragging down spirits in a country that has already suffered years of austerity. From Thessaloniki, my colleague Angelique Chrisafis reports: At Thessaloniki\u2019s bustling market, along the narrow alleys of bargain clothes and some of the cheapest meat and vegetables in the city, the continuing uncertainty surrounding a bailout deal was weighing down those already struggling to get through the month. Michalis Nastos, 54, who runs a clothing stall selling \u20ac10 jeans, \u20ac6 shirts and an array of cheap summer dresses, had been following the finer details of the negotiation offers and was bracing himself for the impact of possible steep VAT rises and pension changes. \u201cThe uncertainty of this whole process has a psychological effect \u2013 people worry about what\u2019s going to happen, they don\u2019t know how or when it\u2019s going to end. We just know everyone is going to be affected, particularly by any rise in VAT.\u201d Already his profits had fallen by more than 50% after years of crisis, unemployment and tax hikes. The market, which once served mostly low-income families, now increasingly attracts a wider range of customers from all over the city in search of the lowest prices. Nastos said his main fear was the proposed rise in VAT \u2014 an indirect sales tax that would push prices up and indiscriminately affect all shoppers, most of whom are already struggling with the effects of previous tax hikes. \u201cOf course I\u2019m against VAT rises, it\u2019s already very high, it will have a knock-on effect. It\u2019s the little details that will really affect people. The price of bread would go up \u2014 that\u2019s important because people in Greece still eat a lot of bread, so you could see the price of a sesame-seed loaf rise from say 50 cents to 70 cents, that would really have an impact. Packaging costs will rise, energy, basics like pasta. Low-income people won\u2019t be able to afford to buy and more and more people won\u2019t be able to make it.\u201d Raising the retirement age was another key issue in discussions in Brussels. One fifth of the Greek population is over 65 and, with the extended family serving as a social safety net, one in two Greek households currently rely on pensions to make ends meet. May have already seen pensions cut and about 45% of pensioners receive pensions below what is considered the poverty limit of \u20ac665 per month. Natsos, who had worked in the market trade for 32 years, would likely have to wait another 11 years to retire. \u201cThe problem is the country just can\u2019t cover its pensions obligations to this number of people,\u201d he said. But he was more concerned about the long-term state of the economy. \u201cGreece definitely needs help, there has to be some kind of debt relief, the country won\u2019t be able to make it otherwise.\u201d Michalis Hadji-Athanasiadis, 84, a former police officer who had retired aged 50, said his pension had shrunk from \u20ac1,600 a month to \u20ac1,000 a month, and his extra benefits had been cut. But his pension was still far higher than the shrinking salary of his 52-year-old daughter who was a high-school teacher and who, like her brother and his wife, still lived with their parents to make ends meet. He said: \u201cPeople are hungry. For five months it seems there has been no progress and business is down everywhere, a lot of shops have closed. Income is down, with VAT going up everything you need to buy becomes so much more expensive.\u201d Near the market, one woman in her 50s, who said her main income came from selling black market Balkan cigarettes, described how customers used to buy five or six packets but were now only buying one or two. \u201cIt feels like life is over,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can barely manage to feed ourselves.\u201d Her adult children, who had lost their jobs as shop-assistants during the recession both lived with her. She adds: \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re going after the little guy, all the high-income people got away with it and got their money out of the country.\u201d Over in Athens the government has announced that the Greek prime minister has just spoken by telephone to the country\u2019s head of state Prokopis Pavlopoulos. Helena Smith reports. \u201cThe prime minister Alexis Tsipras had telephone contact with the president of the republic Prokopis Pavlopoulos a little while ago. He informed the president about the negotiations which are underway,\u201d the statement said. Pavlopoulos, a veteran politician on the right before assuming the largely ceremonial role of president earlier this year, has said he will go to \u201cthe boundaries of my authorities\u201d to ensure that Greece remains at the heart of Europe in the single currency. \u201cI know that my role, not least because of my election by the majority of the parliament who chose me, is to ensure the course of the country in Europe and the euro zone,\u201d he said last week. \u201cAnd that in front of this aim there has to be a solid internal front of all democratic forces. Petty party views and friction can\u2019t come before the achievement of such a goal.\u201d Austria\u2019s chancellor, Werner Faymann, is also optimistic....although he warns that the crisis could run for several more days. Donald Tusk, head of the European Council, has arrived at today\u2019s EU summit meeting - and predicted that the Greek crisis will not end in tragedy. On Greece, he tells reporters that: Work is underway, and for sure it will need still many hours. The last hours have been really critical, but I have a good hunch that unlike in Sophocles\u2019 tragedies, this Greek story will have a happy ending. He adds that he\u2019ll give the media more information tonight after leaders have met (they\u2019ll be discussing the migration crisis and Britain\u2019s plan for an EU referendum). More photos from inside the eurogroup, showing Yanis Varoufakis in quite decent spirits: There is already speculation that ANOTHER meeting might be called over the weekend, which is bound to lift spirits in Brussels, Athens and beyond. Here\u2019s the seating plan for today\u2019s meeting, via Finland\u2019s finance minister. It\u2019s interesting that Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, is next to Yanis Varoufakis. Noonan denied claims he\u2019d \u201cstabbed the Greek people in the back\u201d this week by reportedly suggesting that capital controls might be needed. The photographers in Brussels have surpassed themselves, with a selection of photos from inside today\u2019s eurogroup meeting. Everyone looks remarkably upbeat, given the importance of this meeting, and the dangerous consequences that could follow. Finland\u2019s finance minister, Alex Stubb, has warned that there\u2019s still a significant gap between the two sides.... Malta\u2019s finance minister, Edward Scicluna, has just explained what\u2019s happening right now in Brussels. Arriving at the Eurogroup, he tells reporters that the latest Greek proposal is going to be compared with the 11-page of ideas drawn up by creditors, to see where the disagreements are.. \u201cWe\u2019ve run out of comments, we\u2019re also running out of patience, but we\u2019ve received the document from [Greek finance minister Yanis] Varoufakis just over half an hour ago, so we just merged them before coming here. We need to see what\u2019s been deleted and what\u2019s been added, Sciclina explains, so we can see if a deal is possible. Are you edging closer to a deal? Scicluna suggests that they are positive signs.. The fact we are talking from the same book.... that there\u2019s a specific text, which the three institution have submitted, and there are additions and deletions from that document, well... At least we\u2019re talking from the same text. But there are disageements -- and honestly now I don\u2019t know what they are. Scicluna also refuses to speculate on whether this is the last chance of a deal, or what might happen next.... Several ministers and officials are slipping into the meeting without speaking, including ECB chief Mario Draghi: Confused about the chances of a deal today? Join the club. Even Slovakia\u2019s finance minister says the situation is up in the air. Jeroen Dijsselbloen, head of the eurogroup, has confirmed that a deal hasn\u2019t yet been reached. Arriving at today\u2019s meeting, he says: The only thing we have presented to the eurogroup is what the institutions have drawn up. We don\u2019t have a Greek agreement on that... Oh dear. Germany\u2019s finance minister is not happy. We have not made progress, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble tells reporters in Brussels, adding that Greece has moved \u201cbackwards\u201d. Several experienced crisis watchers agree that Greece\u2019s lenders have given some ground in their latest proposals, while sticking firm on other issues: Carsten Brzeski of ING reckons that the two sides are getting closer: Creditors are also refusing to accept the Greek plan of raising the corporation tax rate from 26% to 29%. In their latest proposal, it would rise to 28%. They are also keeping a firm red line through Athens plan for a one-off 12% tax on all corporate profits over \u20ac500,000. But one other measure has survived, as the FT points out: But the plan keeps Mr Tsipras\u2019s plan to raise luxury tax on yachts from 10% per cent to 13%. Now this is interesting too.... Greece\u2019s creditors are offering that these VAT hikes could be \u201creviewed at the end of 2016\u201d, if Athens has proved that it has raised more revenue through fighting tax evasion and better VAT collection. This leaked proposal shows that creditors have given some ground on the VAT issue -- although they still want to raise a full 1% of GDP through various reforms. They have accepted that Greece could maintain a 6% low rate for pharmaceuticals, books, and the theatre. In previous plans, this rate would have been abolished. But, they are still insisting that the lower VAT rate on Greece\u2019s islands is abolished. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s junior coalition partner, ANEL, has already refused to accept such a move. Creditors also want restaurants and hotels to face the full 23% VAT rate -- they have already warned that this would cost thousands of jobs. The FT has just published the document which Greece\u2019s creditors have drawn up and submitted to the eurozone finance ministers (nice one, Peter). At first glance, it looks pretty similar to the infamous red-ink counter-proposal that the IMF drew up earlier this week. But there are some concessions on pensions. The full 11-page document is online here. Peter Spiegel says: Under the plan sent to finance ministers, Athens would ensure the retirement age is moved to 67 by 2022, significantly faster that Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, had sought. Originally, Athens was pushing for 2036, but Mr Tsipras\u2019 compromise plan submitted on Monday moved that to 2025. There is an important creditor concession in the pension reforms, too, though. Creditors have been trying to get rid of a \u201csolidarity grant\u201d programme that provides a top-up bonus to poorer pensioners, know by the Greek acronym EKAS, by 2017 at the latest. Athens had offered 2020. The new plan splits the difference and goes with December 2019. The EKAS phase-out will start immediately, however, with the wealthiest 20 per cent of the recipients losing the benefit as soon as legislation is passed. There are some other elements of the Greek plan that survived as well, including raising contributions pensioners must make towards healthcare from 4% to 6%. Leaked: Greece bailout plan sent to eurogroup Analysts are digesting the proposals right now.... It\u2019s now clear that there isn\u2019t an agreement between the two sides, despite this morning\u2019s ultimatum. The latest rumour is that both sides are going to submit their own proposals to the eurogroup Yanis Varoufakis has arrived at the eurogroup meeting, carrying a sheet of paper along with his rucksack: Greece\u2019s finance minister then heads inside without speaking to the assembled press. An EU diplomat is briefing that the creditors have sent a proposal up to the eurogroup which, they say, could potentially be the basis for an agreement (Jennifer Rankin reports from Brussels) Important point: This doesn\u2019t mean that Greece has also signed up to the plan. It actually confirms that this morning\u2019s meeting did not deliver a breakthrough. This distinction was missed by some traders, or computer algorithms, which just got rather overexcited: There goes Alexis Tsipras, out of the building after this morning\u2019s talks ended: Greek officials are also briefing that a compromise wasn\u2019t reached at this morning\u2019s meeting. It\u2019s not looking good: EURO ZONE FINANCE MINISTERS WILL WORK WITH A PROPOSAL FROM THE CREDITOR INSTITUTIONS ON GREEK DEAL AS THERE IS NO AGREED DEAL WITH ATHENS - EURO ZONE OFFICIALS So, now what? 1) Has Alexis Tsipras yielded at today\u2019s meeting with Draghi, Lagarde, Juncker, Dijsselbloem and Redling, meaning an agreement can be passed onto the eurogroup? 2) Or has he refused, meaning that eurozone finance ministers will be presented with a proposal drawn up by the creditors? There\u2019s a lot of chatter around, but we should hear the truth soon enough..... The meeting between Alexis Tsipras and the heads of Greece\u2019 creditors appears to have broken up, with the main players heading out of the Commission. JP Morgan\u2019s economist, David Mackie, agrees that Sunday is the next serious deadline, and fears Greece could impose capital controls if it is missed. Austria\u2019s finance minister, Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling, has stated that Sunday is the final deadline to reach an agreement with Greece. That would then give enough time (just) for national parliaments to vote on the plan. He hopes that a compromise can be reached by 4pm Brussels time, though, in time for the EU leaders summit. Schelling made the comments as he arrived at the Commission HQ for this afternoon\u2019s eurogroup meeting Reuters snapped the key points: AUSTRIAN FINMIN SAYS: IF PAPER NOT AGREED BY GREECE, WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES* AUSTRIAN FINMIN SAYS: IT\u2019S GETTING HARDER BY THE MINUTE, SUNDAY IS FINAL DEADLINE* AUSTRIAN FINMIN SAYS: EUROGROUP TO LOOK AT NEW PROPOSALS ON GREECE* AUSTRIAN FINMIN SAYS: HOPE HAS BEEN TO REACH COMPROMISE BY 1400 GMT The Eurogroup meeting was scheduled to start at 1pm Brussels time, or noon BST, but appears to be running late.... When all else fails, reach for a feasibility blueprint: But how feasible can it be for Tsipras to cross his \u2018red lines\u2019 on pensions? This piece on MacroPolis explains how creditors rejected Greece\u2019s plan to raise contribution levels, and also demands that reforms start straight away. Correction: The ECB has actually agreed to a request to maintain Greece\u2019s emergency liquidity at the current level, rather than raising it again, Reuters says. That\u2019s an encouraging sign; suggesting that Greek banks weren\u2019t been hit by further cash withdrawals yesterday. The European Central Bank has just approved today\u2019s emergency liquidity request from the Greek banking sector, according to the newswires. No word on how large the request is, but Greek officials are briefing that the ELA funding could be reviewed again tomorrow. The ECB has already provided around \u20ac89bn of ELA support, to allow Greek banks to handle the deposit flight while bailout negotiations continue. The clocks have struck 11am in Brussels, and everyone watches to see if Greece does produce the new proposal demanded this morning.... As Hans Nichols puts it on Bloomberg TV, \u201cuntil you see Alexis Tsipras\u2019s motorcade heading to the airport\u201d, there\u2019s still hope. Reuters has also heard that Greece was told to produce a new proposal this morning, or else... CREDITOR INSTITUTIONS GAVE GREECE UNTIL 1100 CET TO PRODUCE A NEW, WORKABLE PROPOSAL - EURO ZONE OFFICIAL IF GREECE DOES NOT DELIVER, CREDITOR INSTITUTIONS WILL SUBMIT THEIR OWN PROPOSAL TO EURO ZONE FINANCE MINISTERS AT 1300 CET - EURO ZONE OFFICIAL The crunch moment may just have arrived. According to the Financial Times, creditors have given Alexis Tsipras until 11am Brussels time to produce a \u2018workable\u2019 proposal. That\u2019s in just under 10 minutes time! If he doesn\u2019t give some ground, Athens could then get a \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 offer..... Over to the FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel and Alex Barker: Greece is down to its final hours for negotiations over its soon-to-expire bailout, with creditors giving Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, until 11am Brussels time to come up with a workable economic reform plan to release \u20ac7.2bn in desperately needed rescue aid. According to two senior eurozone officials, if Mr Tsipras fails to reach an agreement \u2014 which people briefed on the talks say is now likely after fruitless all-night talks \u2014 the creditors\u2019 offer will be presented to eurozone finance ministers for a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d choice by Athens. \u201cThe Greeks didn\u2019t move at all,\u201d said one senior official of the talks between Mr Tsipras and the heads of the European Commission, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank, which stretched into the early hours of Thursday before breaking up and resuming at 9am. \u201cThe level of frustration is so high. I don\u2019t see a deal,\u201d the official added. \u201cIt\u2019s looking pretty grim right now. MNI\u2019s Simon Marks also reports that tensions are very high.... Interesting... The Greek stock market has reversed its early 2% fall and is now UP almost 1%. Optimism in Athens? Greece\u2019s labour minister Panos Skourtletis has also been making some incendiary comments this morning, reports Helena Smith. Accusing Athens\u2019 international creditors of deliberately attempting to corrode the Greek government\u2019s authority, Skourletis told the ERT TV station that NOTHING could now be ruled out. \u201cNothing can be excluded by anyone in relation to the success or not of an agreement.\u201d Skourletis claims that creditors are deliberately exhausting Greece financially - \u201casphyxiating the Greek economy\u201d and rejecting any proposed reforms that would have a better effect socially, to weaken the country at the negotiating table. \u201cThey want to reduce the government\u2019s authority,\u201d he added insisting that no deal could be cut if the issue of the country\u2019s monumental debt pile - at \u20ac320bn the highest in the EU - was not also addressed. \u201cThere will be no deal without tackling debt and getting a growth program. No reduction in salaries or pensions\u201d. Government insiders are saying that \u201call scenarios\u201d are now being considered. The leftist daily Syntaktwn this morning said \u201crupture with Europe\u201d was now also on the table. One source said. \u201cWe can\u2019t hide that, yes, there is shock on our part. They are immovable, unyielding.\u201d It all suggests that, even if Tsipras does reach a deal, getting it through the Athens parliament will be a major challenge: Negotiations could easily drag on into the weekend, warns Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit. Here\u2019s our early dispatch from Brussels, by my colleague Jennifer Rankin: More fighting talks from Syriza MPs this morning. Alexis Mitropoulos says: \u201cWe are being confronted with a cartel of lenders.... \u201cThe message that the government has to send is that we are a proud people. We are not going to accept being humiliated,\u201d Speaking on STAR TV, Mitropoulos adding that the EU and IMF had to respect the \u201cdemocratic choice\u201d of the Greek people. State-run TV station ERT is reporting that international lenders are now pushing for \u20ac2.3bn in extra measures on top of the \u20ac8bn Athens has already agreed to. \u201cThey want 1 % of GDP in Value added tax and are insisting that 23 percent be slapped on restaurants.\u201d A striking front page from Greece: The front-page headline of another paper, the left-leaning Syntaktwn newspaper, is also very forceful, Helena reports: \u201cUp to here and enough is enough!\u201d it declared. \u201cThe prime minister rejected the far fetching demands of the lenders.\u201d Over in Athens, politicians, the media and commentariat all concur that D-Day has come. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. Defiance and dismay are the name of the game in Athens this morning. Almost everyone agrees that both sides will have to do what has not been done in five months to date: make crunch decisions that may well change the course of tiny Greece\u2019s history. \u201cThese moments are something more than critical,\u201d the news portal, newsit.gr, wrote with a touch of understatement. \u201cWhite smoke\u201d it said had still not appeared despite negotiations being drawn out into the small hours. A gap of around \u20ac600m appears to be the source of differences, although Greek officials worry that with the International Monetary Fund \u201ctaking such a tough stance\u201d that figure could rise to \u20ac1bn in extra measures. Athens\u2019 leftist-led government says it cannot add that to the \u20ac8bn euro in savings it has already offered. Leading officials in prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 radical left Syriza party repeated accusations this morning that by pushing Greece to the place where it has now pushed it, it had become quite clear that creditors had another agenda: regime change in Athens. The phones have been ringing off the hook between Brussels and Athens with Tsipras, conferring with ministers in the Greek capital \u2013 not least the labour minister Panos Skourletis. \u201cThe hardline faction (among lenders) does not want a an agreement, but rupture, the humiliation of Greece and the fall of the Tsipras government. It is not going to pass,\u201d Syriza\u2019s leading MEP, Dimitris Papadimoulis, wrote on his twitter account. Creditors had, he railed, lost touch with reality. \u201cThey refuse to tax e-gaming but want to add 23% VAT on milk. Are they doing it for \u2026 growth or out of interest?\u201d he wrote in another tweet. Carsten Brzeski, ING\u2019s chief economist, says people are \u201cgetting exhausted\u201d with the endless routine of meetings and deadlines around the Greek crisis. It\u2019s very hard to tell fact from fiction, he told Bloomberg TV this morning. The fact that Tsipras, Lagarde, Draghi and Juncker met until midnight, and technical staff resumed work early this morning, shows there is still political will for a deal. But still: \u201cIf anything, the chances that these negotiations will fail have increased over the last 24 hours.\u201d The Greek stock market has just opened....and shares are, unsurprisingly, falling fast. Bank shares have dropped by 5%, helping to drag the main ATG index down by almost 2%. Europe\u2019s stock markets have fallen a little in early trading, extending yesterday\u2019s losses. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says: The markets are slightly more tentative this morning as another Greece dominant day looms... An unhappy IMF on one side, which wants stronger pension reforms instead of a reliance on raised taxes, and an angry Greek government on the other means Tsipras, and Greece is general, is caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place as judgement day (i.e. a whopping \u20ac1.6bn payment to the Washington-based institution) grows ever closer. Greece and its creditors now have less than four hours to reach some agreement, before Eurozone finance ministers resume their own meeting (which ended so early yesterday) Over in Brussels, MNI reporter Simon Marks has spotted Alexis Tsipras arriving back at the European Commission for more talks with the IMF, ECB and EC: Analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland reckon a deal probably won\u2019t be reached today: A senior official of Greece\u2019s ruling Syriza party has claimed that creditors are trying to \u201cblackmail\u201d the country. Nikos Filis, the ruling Syriza party\u2019s parliamentary spokesman, told Mega TV that: \u201cThe lenders\u2019 demand to bring annihilating measures back to the table shows that the blackmail against Greece is reaching a climax.\u201d Filis added that Greece is adamant that lenders must embrace the issue of debt relief: \u201cThere cannot be a deal without a substantial reference and specific steps on the issue of debt.\u201d (Thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Europe\u2019s indefatigably optimistic economics affairs commissioner, Pierre Moscovoci, has tweeted that \u201cWhere there is a will, there is a way\u201d. That phrase was used by Angela Merkel earlier this month; wonder if she still agrees.... Good morning. Last ditch talks. Going to the wire. Groundhog Day. Pick your clich\u00e9, because it\u2019s going to be another one of those moments. Greece and its creditors are hunkering down for another attempt to reach an agreement over its bailout package, which expires in just six days. Technical teams are already at their desks working away. And soon, Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, will meet with IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, ECB president Mario Draghi, and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. Those talks are expected to start at 9am Brussels time, or 8am BST. They can\u2019t have had much sleep -- emergency talks between the quartet lasted until after midnight. Juncker still had enough energy to wave at our Europe editor, Ian Traynor - which must be a good sign. The meeting ended in the early hours of Thursday with Greece \u201cremaining firm on its position\u201d according to a Greek government official. The two sides are really struggling to close the yawning gap over the measures Greece must take to obtain bailout funds. As we covered yesterday, the IMF refuses to accept Athens\u2019 plan to raise \u20ac8bn mainly through tax rises, and is demanding much tougher pension reforms. Today\u2019s goal is to make serious progress this morning, so that eurozone finance ministers have a proposal to sign off when they meet - for the fourth time in a week - at 1pm Brussels time (or noon BST) Then, EU leaders gather for a two-day summit this evening that was meant to focus on the migration crisis, and Britain\u2019s renegotiation plans. Greece, though, could hijack the event, with Tsipras\u2019s insisting that Greece must be given debt relief. We\u2019ll be tracking all the events through the day....",

The price of bread would go up \u2014 that\u2019s important because people in Greece still eat a lot of bread, so you could see the price of a sesame-seed loaf rise from say 50 cents to 70 cents, that would really have an impact. Packaging costs will rise, energy, basics like pasta. Low-income people won\u2019t be able to afford to buy and more and more people won\u2019t be able to make it.\u201d</p> <p>Raising the retirement age was another key issue in discussions in Brussels. One fifth of the Greek population is over 65 and, with the extended family serving as a social safety net, one in two Greek households currently rely on pensions to make ends meet. May have already seen pensions cut and about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/15/unsustainable-futures-greece-pensions-dilemma-explained-financial-crisis-default-eurozone\">45% of pensioners receive pensions below what is considered the poverty limit of \u20ac665 per month.</a></p> <p>Natsos, who had worked in the market trade for 32 years, would likely have to wait another 11 years to retire. \u201cThe problem is the country just can\u2019t cover its pensions obligations to this number of people,\u201d he said. But he was more concerned about the long-term state of the economy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cGreece definitely needs help, there has to be some kind of debt relief, the country won\u2019t be able to make it otherwise.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Michalis Hadji-Athanasiadis</strong>, 84, a former police officer who had retired aged 50, said his pension had shrunk from \u20ac1,600 a month to \u20ac1,000 a month, and his extra benefits had been cut. But his pension was still far higher than the shrinking salary of his 52-year-old daughter who was a high-school teacher and who, like her brother and his wife, still lived with their parents to make ends meet. </p> <p>He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \u201cPeople are hungry. For five months it seems there has been no progress and business is down everywhere, a lot of shops have closed. Income is down, with VAT going up everything you need to buy becomes so much more expensive.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Near the market, one woman in her 50s, who said her main income came from selling black market Balkan cigarettes, described how customers used to buy five or six packets but were now only buying one or two. \u201cIt feels like life is over,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can barely manage to feed ourselves.\u201d Her adult children, who had lost their jobs as shop-assistants during the recession both lived with her. </p> <p>She adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re going after the little guy, all the high-income people got away with it and got their money out of the country.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-558bffaee4b024f829c5d5e1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-25T13:21:35.225Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tsipras speaks with Greek president</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c3bdb081d99c4448ccdd75fb4c03598bfa2da5d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3bdb081d99c4448ccdd75fb4c03598bfa2da5d1/1815_46_1523_914/1000.jpg\" alt=\"epa04676984 Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos (R) welcomes Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis (L) during their meeting in Athens, Greece, 24 March 2015.

      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s creditors have set the country a weekend deadline to avoid default and stay in the eurozone, after more than 24 hours of non-stop Brussels negotiations at the highest level resulted in stalemate. After talks between Athens and its creditors failed to reach an agreement on Thursday, a further meeting of eurozone finance ministers will be held on Saturday in a bid to achieve a breakthrough. With the German chancellor Angela Merkel insisting that a deal must be reached before markets open on Monday morning, Greece is now running out of time to secure an accord and make a \u20ac1.6bn payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday. Following a 24-hour period that involved three rounds of talks between Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and Greece\u2019s creditors, as well as two sessions of eurozone finance ministers, officials described the situation as entrenched and immobilised. \u201cThey can talk and talk, but the gap does not narrow,\u201d said an EU official. \u201cBoth sides are in their trenches.\u201d Arriving at an EU leaders\u2019 summit on Thursday evening that threatened to be overshadowed by the Greek crisis, Merkel said Greece had \u201cgone backwards\u201d on some issues. Merkel abandoned her usual conciliatory tone to privately tell fellow European centre-right leaders: \u201cGermany cannot be blackmailed.\u201d Dropping the good cop-bad cop act that contrasts Merkel\u2019s cautious tone with the hawkish attitude of her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, she said the situation was regressing in the marathon negotiations. Ahead of the evening summit, a session of eurozone finance ministers broke up without agreement after the troika of lenders \u2013 the European Central Bank (ECB), the IMF, and the European commission \u2013 dismissed Greek reform proposals from earlier in the week. The creditors tabled their own tougher terms for a settlement that would unlock a remaining \u20ac7.2bn in bailout funds for Greece and hold out the prospect of later debt relief and more rescue funds. Finance experts from both sides are to work non-stop between Thursday evening and Saturday lunchtime, when the eurozone finance ministers are expected to reassemble for what looks like the last of many last chances. Tsipras appears to have little room or time for manoeuvre. There was speculation he could call a referendum or fresh elections after he made the unusual move of calling Athens to speak to Greece\u2019s head of state. Merkel\u2019s Monday deadline reflected the tight timetable that has now been imposed on Greece. If agreement is struck on Saturday, the terms would need to be rushed through the Greek parliament on Sunday, then through the Bundestag in Berlin on Monday, in order to ensure that the bailout programme, which expires on Tuesday, is extended. With no agreement, the ECB will withdraw its support to the ailing Greek banking system on Tuesday, which would force the Athens government to impose capital controls in order to prevent bank runs. \u201cIf there is no package, the situation for the ECB is clear,\u201d said an informed source. Such is the level of urgency, the German government on Thursday forwarded the text of the creditors\u2019 terms to the parliament in Berlin in preparation for Monday. On the other hand, EU officials said that if a last-minute solution is found on Saturday, the IMF payment could be facilitated by the ECB forwarding profits due to Greece on its bond holdings to the Washington-based institution. The ECB is believed to owe Greece around \u20ac2bn in profits from its securities markets programme. The EU commissioner for economic and financial affairs, Pierre Moscovici, said Greece and its creditors were still at loggerheads over reforms to Greek pensions and VAT rates, which lenders want to be toughened as quid pro quo for giving Athens further bailout funds. Meanwhile, the IMF told reporters in Washington that it would not move its 30 June deadline for the \u20ac1.6bn payment. \u201cAs a matter of longstanding policy, the fund does not extend payment deadlines,\u201d said a spokesman for the IMF. However, Greek officials began to voice optimism late on Thursday that an agreement could be reached. Echoing Merkel, insiders in the Syriza-led government said it was vital that Greece cut a deal with the bodies keeping it afloat before markets opened on Monday. \u201cThere is a detectable shift in stance. Under pressure, lenders have retreated on several issues,\u201d said Syriza\u2019s prominent euro MP Dimitris Papadimoulis. \u201cWe are beginning to see that differences are bridgeable, that an agreement will be reached.\u201d But mounting anger over the sheer scale of concessions Athens will be forced to make will ensure that any deal faces a difficult passage. Several leading government members accused creditors on Thursday of attempting to impose regime change in Athens by pushing the government too far from its electoral mandate of ending austerity. \u201cIt is clear they want to reduce the government\u2019s authority,\u201d railed the Labour minister Panos Skourletis, joining the chorus of politicians who have accused the EU and IMF of wanting to topple Europe\u2019s first far left administration.",

      "bodyText": "In his article, Matthew d\u2019Ancona (Osborne\u2019s coup: converting Labour to fiscal conservatism, 22 June) accepts the conventional wisdom that Labour\u2019s prodigal spending after 1997 made worse the global financial crisis a decade later. He quotes David Cameron asserting in 2010 that Labour had \u201cmaxed out its credit card\u201d and Chuka Umunna\u2019s rueful question: \u201cIf government can\u2019t run a surplus in the 15th year of economic expansion, when can it run one?\u201d The fact is that debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 42.5% in 1996-97, the year Labour took power, to 35.9% in 2006-07, the year before the banks failed. Moreover, no government surplus, however large, could have funded the \u00a3300bn exposure the UK government was forced to take on to keep the banks open, nor the fact that when, as a direct result of the bank failures, GDP fell 6% in 2009-10 \u2013 one of the largest and fastest falls in history \u2013 and tax take fell 18%. This was what caused the deficit, not prodigal spending on health, education and welfare, nor Labour\u2019s failure to run a surplus. Patrick Renshaw Sheffield \u2022 Matthew d\u2019Ancona is of course correct about \u201cGeorge Osborne\u2019s coup\u201d in converting Labour to the false god of harsh fiscal conservatism. What is surprising is the utter lack of a robust counter-narrative, especially when there is an almost blindingly obvious response to the charge of New Labour economic mismanagement and excessive borrowing: just ask the bond markets. Was the bond market closed to New Labour? If not, then clearly the market gods sanctified New Labour\u2019s economic credentials. A simple look at the interest rates of UK government 10-year gilts over the New Labour period should therefore be enough to win the argument. The UK was no Greece. The interest rate on Britain\u2019s benchmark bond fluctuated sedately and relatively narrowly over the entire period of New Labour rule, even as government debt remained virtually flat as a percentage of GDP. The slight bump in rates in 2007 came as a result of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary contraction in trying to cool off a booming economy rather than a bond market reaction. It might chafe those on the left to cite market reason as evidence of sound economic management, and financial markets are of course far from rational. Yet the tactical use of market evidence against the Tories puts them in a bind. Either they would have to deny the rationality of the markets, thus entirely abandoning the case for so-called sound finance, or confect a convoluted reason as to why the bond markets didn\u2019t bark. Either way, Labour would be turning Tory weapons against them rather than agreeing to play by their damaging rules. Dr Anush Kapadia Lecturer, international politics, City University London \u2022 The whirring noise that Matthew d\u2019Ancona can hear in his ear is the sound of John Maynard Keynes revolving in his grave at d\u2019Ancona\u2019s contention that George Osborne has managed to traduce Keynes\u2019s deep insights merely by endlessly repeating a lie. A truly great politician (think Franklin D Roosevelt) \u2013 of which we are today desperately short \u2013 would have sought to convince the public that their \u201ccommonsense\u201d view that government spending in a recession was wrong was itself misguided. Instead, Osborne and the rest of the coalition, assisted by the rightwing press (ie most of the press), merely used people\u2019s gullibility for their own nefarious ends. D\u2019Ancona should be presenting this as dishonest rather than clever. David Quinn London \u2022 We now know (The vicious cycle of inequality that must be broken, Larry Elliott, 22 June) that one half of the IMF (the economists) believes that inequality damages the economy and supports investment in education, an enhanced role for trade unions and higher taxes on the rich. The other half (the financiers) goes on demanding measures that add to poverty, hit growth, and make inequality worse. We know which IMF the chancellor supports. Is there any chance that any of the candidates for Labour leader might back the economists? Larry Elliott lists 15 measures that together would reverse the slide to inequality and destructive wealth extraction we have seen since 1980 or so. The simplest include making a living wage the minimum wage; a regularly updated and progressive property tax; a wealth tax; and a 65% top rate of income tax. It is clear that the US and UK functioned better when top rates were around 80% or above, so 65% is extremely modest but might be sufficient. The economic case is overwhelming if the aspirations of ordinary people are to be met. So Mr Burnham, Ms Cooper, Mr Corbyn, how about it? Richard Gravil Penrith, Cumbria \u2022 Larry Elliott has set out the case for the end of neoliberal economic policy very clearly. As he says, the IMF, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the World Bank and the World Economic Forum have all recognised that inequality is a threat to economic stability. And austerity \u2013 the policy opposed by 250,000 marching on the streets of London on Saturday \u2013 is a discredited, failed approach, even on its own terms. Referring to the work of author Tony Atkinson, Elliott lists seven of his proposals for the UK to tackle inequality. Among them, five were in the Green party manifesto: a minimum wage set at the level of a living wage, a wealth tax, a universal basic income, replacement of council tax, and a rise in the top level of income tax (he said 65%, we said 60%). These won the backing of more than 1.1 million voters \u2013 many of them first-time voters for the Green party \u2013 although as a result of our outdated electoral system their choice is represented in parliament by only one MP \u2013 Caroline Lucas. As Elliott says, these are bold changes but necessary ones \u2013 the economic status quo, as championed by our current government, is not an option. Natalie Bennett Green party leader \u2022 Suzanne Moore\u2019s excellent article (However you twist the figures child poverty does not exist in some vacuum, 25 June) misses one point. David Cameron is quite right that the method of measuring poverty becomes distorted over time. The incomes of families have and are being depressed by the austerity imposed by the governments he has led since 2010. This means that 60% of average earnings is now considerably lower than it was five years ago, which means that the number of children in poverty is exponentially larger than government figures show. Let\u2019s look at another measure. Trussell Trust statistics show that 46,018 children were provided with emergency food in the financial year ending 2012. By March 2015 the number had increased to 396,997 children \u2013 more than eight times as many in just three years. These figures demonstrate the shameful impact of government policies on our children. And people who are forced to use food banks in order to feed themselves and their families are but the tip of the poverty iceberg. Brian Fullaway Kings Worthy, Hampshire \u2022 Matthew d\u2019Ancona\u2019s claim is presumptuous, but deserves an answer. The fundamental point is that austerity is the wrong way to cut the deficit, for three reasons. It flattens growth by squeezing demand out of the economy, which is exactly what happened in 2012 after two years of Osborne\u2019s austerity which forced him to backpedal on cuts in order to kickstart the economy into a (temporary) surge of growth in 2013 by printing money galore (QE) and setting off another housing bubble. The same is about to recur, as growth has once again petered out with the last quarter\u2019s rate plummeting to 0.3%. Second, austerity is ineffective in cutting the deficit. Alistair Darling\u2019s economic stimulus in 2009-10 \u2013 the right way to deal with the deficit \u2013 cut it from \u00a3153bn in 2010 to \u00a3113bn in 2012, a huge reduction of \u00a340bn in two years. Osborne\u2019s austerity package then kicked in, and the deficit began to rise to \u00a3125bn at the end of 2012. Only when Osborne was forced to reverse engines in 2013 did it start to go down again, to \u00a399bn in 2014, a feeble net reduction of just \u00a314bn in two and a half years. The record makes it as plain as a pikestaff: austerity doesn\u2019t work, growth does. Third, given that Osborne has so far cut the deficit by an average of only \u00a37bn a year, his claim that he will eliminate it altogether by 2018-19 is plain delusional. On his past record it could take him to 2028. Even this leaves out the grotesque injustice that very painful cuts are now about to be imposed on the bottom half of the population to atone for the arrogance and incompetence of the top 1%. Pace d\u2019Ancona, Labour has not converted to fiscal conservatism. Rather it has pusillanimously succumbed to the prevailing ideological canard about deficits. It\u2019s high time the Labour leadership contestants now stood up and told the truth: Osborne\u2019s austerity has been a disaster and should be jettisoned in favour of an unqualified commitment to growth. Michael Meacher MP Labour, Oldham West and Royton \u2022 George Osborne has borrowed about \u00a32bn every week, more than the three previous governments together, even allowing for the 2008 US induced financial crisis and the purchase by Gordon Brown of sizeable parts of major banks during his office. In fact, the sum borrowed over the last parliament is the highest in history and more than it costs to run the whole of the NHS for the five-year period. (You could say the NHS has been run on borrowed money for the last five years, not a comforting thought.) Selling cheap part-state-owned bank shares is to try, by any means, to reduce borrowing. Likewise, the cutting of tax credits. But \u00a312bn will barely cover the interest on the \u00a3500bn that Osborne has borrowed \u2013 and it is still at record levels. Cliff Billings Droitwich Spa, Worcestershire \u2022 Larry Elliott records 15 proposals for reducing inequality in the UK. May I add a 16th, which would also contribute to reversing intergenerational inequality? Pensioners\u2019 freebies like TV licences, heating allowances and bus passes should become taxable benefits for those with incomes above, say, \u00a330,000pa. Many of us better-off pensioners from professional and managerial backgrounds have in recent decades benefited from three unearned financial windfalls. First, by living on average 10 or so years longer than our occupational and state pension contributions allowed for, our later years are being financed largely out of taxes and pension contributions from the younger working population. Second, many of us have received unearned capital gains in real terms from house-price inflation. Third, the real burden of our mortgage repayments was whittled away by the high inflation rates of the 70s and 80s. Hence there has been a redistribution of income and wealth in favour of better-off pensioners, at the expense of the younger generations. Let us at least claw some of this back. Lawrence Lockhart Bath \u2022 The Labour party could hardly do better than adopt Professor Sir Tony Atkinson\u2019s proposals, commended by Larry Elliott. Even if Tory cuts are broadly popular, public opinion has also shown itself in favour of policies against inequality. They would also be more effective in dealing with the economy than cuts would be. Too few yet grasp that cuts are about the drive to hack back the state, not the economy. Perhaps Labour could show some political initiative by questioning whose state it is and adopt Atkinson\u2019s proposals as economically sophisticated and credible steps towards the reply: \u201cIt\u2019s all the people\u2019s state, not George Osborne\u2019s.\u201d John Veit-Wilson Newcastle upon Tyne",

He quotes David Cameron asserting in 2010 that Labour had \u201cmaxed out its credit card\u201d and Chuka Umunna\u2019s rueful question: \u201cIf government can\u2019t run a surplus in the 15th year of economic expansion, when can it run one?\u201d The fact is that debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 42.5% in 1996-97, the year Labour took power, to 35.9% in 2006-07, the year before the banks failed. Moreover, no government surplus, however large, could have funded the \u00a3300bn exposure the UK government was forced to take on to keep the banks open, nor the fact that when, as a direct result of the bank failures, GDP fell 6% in 2009-10 \u2013 one of the largest and fastest falls in history \u2013 and tax take fell 18%. This was what caused the deficit, not prodigal spending on health, education and welfare, nor Labour\u2019s failure to run a surplus. <br><strong>Patrick Renshaw</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 Matthew d\u2019Ancona is of course correct about \u201cGeorge Osborne\u2019s coup\u201d in converting Labour to the false god of harsh fiscal conservatism. What is surprising is the utter lack of a robust counter-narrative, especially when there is an almost blindingly obvious response to the charge of New Labour economic mismanagement and excessive borrowing: just ask the bond markets. Was the bond market closed to New Labour? If not, then clearly the market gods sanctified New Labour\u2019s economic credentials. A simple look at the <a href=\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/government-bond-yield\" title=\"\">interest rates of UK government 10-year gilts</a> over the New Labour period should therefore be&#xa0;enough to win the argument.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>The whirring noise that Matthew d\u2019Ancona can hear in his ear is the sound of John Maynard Keynes revolving in his grave</p> <footer> <cite>David Quinn</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The UK was no Greece. The interest rate on Britain\u2019s benchmark bond fluctuated sedately and relatively narrowly over the entire period of New Labour rule, even as government debt remained virtually flat as a percentage of GDP. The slight bump in rates in 2007 came as a result of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary contraction in trying to cool off a booming economy rather than&#xa0;a bond market reaction.</p> <p>It might chafe those on the left to cite market reason as evidence of sound economic management, and financial markets are of course far from rational. Yet the tactical use of market evidence against the Tories puts them in a bind. Either they would have to deny the rationality of the markets, thus entirely abandoning the case for so-called sound finance, or confect a convoluted reason as to why the bond markets didn\u2019t bark.

      "bodyText": "Patrick McLoughlin wants to \u201cpause\u201d investment on two key rail routes while he \u201cresets\u201d Network Rail\u2019s investment programme. If the transport secretary can\u2019t speak plainly, let\u2019s say it for him. All sides have been engaged in wishful thinking on a grand scale and the government\u2019s boasts about the coming \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d look a lot less impressive after a collision with reality on the railways. After a single lap of the track, Network Rail\u2019s five-year spending and funding programme for 2014-19 \u2013 a dense work of 950 pages from the Office of Rail and Road \u2013 will have to be shredded. All the projects won\u2019t be built within the \u00a338bn budget. The lines where electrification will be \u201cpaused\u201d are the TransPennine service and the London to Sheffield route. Who\u2019s to blame? McLoughlin says all the problems \u201ccould and should have been foreseen by Network Rail.\u201d Over at the manager of Britain\u2019s railways, there\u2019s a strong hint that the imposed targets were near-impossible to achieve in the first place. New-ish chief executive Mark Carne dutifully confessed to corporate over-optimism but added, pointedly, that the body had \u201csigned up to highly ambitious five-year targets set by the regulator.\u201d There\u2019s probably truth in both versions. What\u2019s the solution? That\u2019s the important question, but it\u2019s also where the tale becomes even fuzzier. McLoughlin has appointed a new chairman of Network Rail in the form of Sir Peter Hendy, current transport commissioner in London. He\u2019s tweaked governance by removing the 46 \u201cpublic members\u201d and installing his own special director. Dame Colette Bowe, when she\u2019s not trying to make bankers behave better as chair of the Banking Standards Review Council, will make recommendations on better investment planning. New faces may help but, to get a measure of how deep Network Rail\u2019s problems go, read a speech Carne gave in February. Network Rail\u2019s chief executive is an oilman from Shell and compared the safety record of the two industries. Network Rail\u2019s passenger safety performance is currently the best in Europe but its record for injuries among its workers is shocking. Some 600 railway employees and contractors a year are injured to the extent that they can\u2019t return to work the next day. In the oil and gas industry, the comparable figure for the same numbers of hours worked would be fewer than 60. \u201cOur work practices have not kept pace with comparable heavy engineering industries,\u201d he concluded. The open question is whether the necessary improvements can happen within a timeframe acceptable to government and passengers. It\u2019s hard to be confident. The Treasury looks at Network Rail\u2019s \u00a337.8bn of debt, now firmly on the government\u2019s balance sheet on the orders of the EU, and shudders. Unless matters improve quickly, one suspects the government will be tempted to make more radical reforms. Network Rail is forming clearer regional divisions internally. Could the entire company be split formally into separate units in the interests of competition and easier decision-making? It\u2019s a plausible long-term strategy on paper; in practice, the short-term effect might be more confusion, frustration and missed targets. At the moment, though, nothing should be ruled out. The relationship between government and Network Rail is in danger of becoming dysfunctional. Packaging premium It\u2019s got a dull name and it operates in a less-than-fashionable industry, but let\u2019s hear a cheer for DS Smith, British champion of cardboard boxes. The company is one of those FTSE 250 businesses that deserve more attention for its quiet achievements overseas. Smith\u2019s big bet was the \u20ac1.6bn purchase of Swedish rival SCA Packaging in 2012. That deal has delivered in spades as the cost savings have arrived as advertised. The share price has risen from 150p to 390p since the purchase. Supplying packaging to the likes of Unilever and Nestle sound like a low-margin game but, at the operating level, Smith produced 8.8%, which translated to a one-fifth rise to \u00a3200m in pre-tax profits. Chief executive Miles Roberts reckons margins could get better yet. He lifted the formal medium-term target by a percentage point to 8%-10%. Smith now operates in 27 European countries, which creates opportunities for add-on purchases.

In retrospect, the moment to pounce was last summer when the market was fretting about the effects of a weak euro. But there\u2019s still a dividend yield of 3% and return on capital employed is 14.6%.

McLoughlin says all the problems \u201ccould and should have been foreseen by Network Rail.\u201d Over at the manager of Britain\u2019s railways, there\u2019s a strong hint that the imposed targets were near-impossible to achieve in the first place. New-ish chief executive Mark Carne dutifully confessed to corporate over-optimism but added, pointedly, that the body had \u201csigned up to highly ambitious five-year targets set by the regulator.\u201d There\u2019s probably truth in both versions.</p> <p>What\u2019s the solution? That\u2019s the important question, but it\u2019s also where the tale becomes even fuzzier. McLoughlin has appointed a new chairman of Network Rail in the form of Sir Peter Hendy, current transport commissioner in London. He\u2019s tweaked governance by removing the 46 \u201cpublic members\u201d and installing his own special director. Dame Colette Bowe, when she\u2019s not trying to make bankers behave better as chair of the Banking Standards Review Council, will make recommendations on better investment planning.</p> <p>New faces may help but, to get a measure of how deep Network Rail\u2019s problems go, read a speech Carne gave in February. Network Rail\u2019s chief executive is an oilman from Shell and compared the safety record of the two industries. Network Rail\u2019s passenger safety performance is currently the best in Europe but its record for injuries among its workers is shocking.</p> <p>Some 600 railway employees and contractors a year are injured to the extent that they can\u2019t return to work the next day. In the oil and gas industry, the comparable figure for the same numbers of hours worked would be fewer than 60. \u201cOur work practices have not kept pace with comparable heavy engineering industries,\u201d he concluded.</p> <p>The open question is whether the necessary improvements can happen within a timeframe acceptable to government and passengers. It\u2019s hard to be confident. The Treasury looks at Network Rail\u2019s \u00a337.8bn of debt, now firmly on the government\u2019s balance sheet on the orders of the EU, and shudders.</p> <p>Unless matters improve quickly, one suspects the government will be tempted to make more radical reforms. Network Rail is forming clearer regional divisions internally. Could the entire company be split formally into separate units in the interests of competition and easier decision-making? It\u2019s a plausible long-term strategy on paper; in practice, the short-term effect might be more confusion, frustration and missed targets.</p> <p>At the moment, though, nothing should be ruled out. The relationship between government and Network Rail is in danger of becoming dysfunctional.</p> <h2>Packaging premium</h2> <p>It\u2019s got a dull name and it operates in a less-than-fashionable industry, but let\u2019s hear a cheer for DS Smith, British champion of cardboard boxes. The company is one of those FTSE 250 businesses that deserve more attention for its quiet achievements overseas.<br></p> <p>Smith\u2019s big bet was the \u20ac1.6bn purchase of Swedish rival SCA Packaging in 2012.

      "bodyText": "Ed Miliband\u2019s pledge in 2013 to freeze energy bills and \u201creset\u201d the market may feel like ancient history, but next month the big six power suppliers will face a renewed test of their public reputation. The Competition and Markets Authority will present provisional findings from its investigation into the power supply sector on 7 July. The world may have moved on \u2013 and the Conservatives won an election \u2013 since the Labour leader\u2019s intervention nearly two years ago, but the watchdog\u2019s report will throw renewed light on an industry that remains deeply unpopular. What improvement there has been in the fortunes of the big six has come in part simply because the price of power has fallen \u2013 further encouraged by a warm winter \u2013 and in part because Cameron\u2019s conservatives taking full power has taken Labour\u2019s confrontational stance firmly off the agenda. But put on the back foot by that Labour conference pledge nearly two years ago, and amid rising consumer anger, the government responded by ordering the regulators to assess competition in the market. The result was energy regulator Ofgem finding \u201cpossible tacit co-ordination\u201d on the size and timing of price rises by British Gas, EDF, E.ON, npower, Scottish Power and SSSE. Some of the rising public and political heat over fuel poverty was taken out of the situation finally last year when the Competition and Markets Authority began a full industry investigation. But despite the ongoing inquiry, as recently as January Ofgem was complaining that falls in wholesale gas prices were still not being passed on sufficiently to customers and company profits were continuing to rise. With the key findings of that competition review due as soon as the end of the month, the row is likely to be reignited with the CMA expected to blame bad regulation rather than profiteering on the part of the suppliers themselves. But initial hopes of critics that the big six would be forcibly broken up to separate their wholesale power divisions from their retail energy supply arms are expected to be dashed. The competition authorities are instead tipped to argue that so-called \u201cvertical integration\u201d is not the real problem. Instead the CMA will focus on the way the incumbent large firms have a built-in advantage from \u201csticky\u201d customers who for a variety of reasons \u2013 apathy, even misplaced loyalty \u2013 do not take the trouble to switch supplier. It is those bulk of those customers - usually inherited from the days of nationalisation and on standard variable tariffs \u2013 who are getting what even the government\u2019s energy adviser, Dieter Helm, calls a \u201cbum deal.\u201d The competition authority will suggest ways of reinvigorating a stagnant market in an attempt to inject more competition and opportunities for independent suppliers such as First Utility, Ecotricity and Ovo Energy which have been increasing their market share - but slowly. Ironically, one way the watchdog may recommend to scrap a scheme introduced relatively recently by Ofgem, which aimed to simplify the choice for consumers by cutting the number of tariffs suppliers could offer to four. The CMA is expected to justify this move, which may concern consumer groups but will please the companies, by arguing that restricting the number of tariffs is counterproductive. It is expected to argue that by stifling innovation the tariff limit works in favour of the big six, which still hold 90% of the retail market. Although some of the political heat around the energy sector has been reduced, consumers remain concerned and the companies themselves continue to struggle with their public image despite offering a raft of price cuts. Recent research from consumer group, Which?, showed that energy costs had risen from 2% of household income in 2004 to 4% a decade later. Two thirds of those questioned in a survey worried about the cost of energy more than anything else. Angela Knight, the outgoing head of Energy UK, the lobby group for power companies admitted late December the consumer remained suspicious of the industry. She said: \u201cWe have certainly improved [our reputation] a bit. Not a lot\u2026 If the industry was at three [out of 10 during the height of the criticism in the winter of 2013] we are now at four and rising. We have a long way [to go].\u201d The CMA report will try to address this - as will an initiative from Ofgem itself to move into a system of \u201cprinciples-based regulation\u201d which would concentrate on holding companies to a wider duty of avoiding consumer harm. The energy regulator is planning to hold a preliminary meeting on the issue on 7 July with power suppliers but consumer groups are already nervous, saying such light-touch regulation will only work if more specific rules are retained. But despite the fears of consumer groups, the change of emphasis might not work in the favour of the big six. Small independent supplier Ovo Energy has welcomed the move, describing the current regulatory regime as \u201cnonsensical and burdensome\u201d and saying the quantity and complexity of regulation in the energy retail market is a barrier to entry and expansion.",

Athens puts the onus on its creditors to prevent it being forced out of the single currency, warning that an economic collapse on a par with the Great Depression of the 1930s has left it broke and unable to pay its debts. The UK starts planning for \u201cserious economic risks\u201d arising from Greek exit from the euro. Thursday 18 June \u201cWe can only arrive at a resolution if there is a dialogue. Right now we\u2019re short of a dialogue.\u201d Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, says there is an urgent need for negotiation \u201cwith adults in the room\u201d. Greece faces a full-blown banking crisis after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers breaks down in acrimony and recrimination, forcing leaders to meet next week. Friday 19 June \u201cThe game of chicken needs to end and so does the blame game. This is not a game and there is no time for any games.\u201d ECB provides more emergency help as the European Council president, Donald Tusk, says Greece must choose between a \u201cgood\u201d deal and a default. Monday 22 June \u201cThe most important thing is that the leaders take full responsibility for the political process to avoid the worst case scenario, which means uncontrollable, chaotic Graccident.\u201d Tusk issues a clear warning that he wants serious progress at an emergency EU summit. Tsipras receives a mock slap from the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, when he arrives in Brussels. The Athens stock market surges 9%, and the summit ends with high hopes of reaching a deal within 48 hours. The new Greek proposals leak, revealing cuts of \u20ac8bn. Tuesday 23 June \u201cWe are fully aware that there are in the proposal, measures that are hard and which under other circumstances we would never take.\u201d Greek government spokesman Gavriel Sakellarides also says: \u201cThe climate has improved, we are closer to a solution.\u201d The European Central Bank is rumoured to have agreed to provide more emergency liquidity to the Greek banking sector. Wednesday 24 June The non-acceptance of offsetting measures has never happened before. Neither in Ireland nor in Portugal. Nowhere! This strange attitude can only mean one of two things: either they do not want an agreement or they are serving specific interests in Greece. Tsipras makes the comments before heading back to Brussels for emergency talks with Greece\u2019s creditors and Europe\u2019s leading politicians \u2013 the third time eurozone finance ministers have held meetings in less than a week. Talks carry on into the night, but there is no deal.",

The dozen or so members of the executive committee had on average about 25% of their bonus withheld, while the the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, had \u00a3350,000 docked.

      "bodyText": "Talks on the Greek debt crisis between eurozone finance ministers have ground to a halt after Athens rejected counter-proposals from its creditors. Eurozone finance ministers came to Brussels for an emergency meeting but failed to bridge their differences with Greece, in the fourth diplomatic failure in eight days. The EU commissioner for economic and financial affairs, Pierre Moscovici, said Greece and its creditors were still at loggerheads over reforms to Greek pensions and VAT rates, which lenders want to be toughened as a quid pro quo for giving Athens further bailout funds. Greece\u2019s creditors - the European Commission, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank - are demanding further spending cuts in Athens before agreeing to release the \u20ac7.2bn in funds that the country needs in order to meet a \u20ac1.6bn payment due to the IMF next Tuesday. The finance ministers are expected to reconvene on Saturday for further talks as the crisis goes to the wire. The Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said both sides would continue to seek an agreement, as they attempt to square the differences between a Greek plan submitted on Monday and a counter-proposal from the lenders. He said: \u201cWe shall continue our deliberations, the institutions are going to look again at the two documents - our documents and their own, there will be discussions with the Greek government, and we\u2019ll continue until we find a solution.\u201d Meanwhile, the IMF told reporters in Washington that it would not move its 30 June deadline for the \u20ac1.6bn payment. \u201cAs a matter of longstanding policy, the Fund does not extend payment deadlines,\u201d said a spokesman for the IMF. Wrangling over the Greek debt crisis is overshadowing a summit of all 28 EU leaders, where politicians are discussing migration and David Cameron\u2019s proposals for renegotiating Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU. But hopes of a breakthrough were fading even before the ministers sat round the table. Arriving at the meeting, Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, said Greece had moved backwards, a message that was echoed by the German chancellor Angela Merkel. The chair of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said ministers would be waiting to hear ideas from the Greeks. Ahead of the meeting on Thursday morning, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, spent more than three hours in a meeting with the leaders of the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European commission, but left without an agreement. Despite the stalemate, Tsipras said he was confident of reaching a compromise that would allow Greece to overcome the crisis: \u201cEuropean history is full of disagreements, negotiations, and then compromises.\u201d Rumours were swirling that Greece\u2019s creditors were going to present Athens with an ultimatum to accept their austerity plan in exchange for releasing \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a35.1bn) in bailout funds. But one EU diplomat said there was no take-it-or-leave-it deal and institutions remained available for further discussion. The two sides still appear to be far apart, however. Greece\u2019s creditors want the Tsipras government to make deeper spending cuts, as well as faster and more sweeping reforms to the Greek pension system, according to a leaked version of the creditors\u2019 counter-proposals that is very similar to an earlier version rejected by the Greeks on Wednesday. Greece\u2019s lenders are pressing Athens to accept more austerity in exchange for continuing the bailout programme worth \u20ac240bn (\u00a3171bn). Tsipras, who has been seeking to wrest back control over the Greek economy, has accused the lenders of not wanting a deal and serving \u201cspecial interests\u201d in Greece. As the talks stagger on, a senior Syriza official accused the creditors of trying to blackmail Greece. \u201cThe lenders\u2019 demand to bring annihilating measures back to the table shows that the blackmail against Greece is reaching a climax,\u201d Nikos Filis, the Syriza\u2019s parliamentary spokesman, told Greek broadcaster Mega TV. Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told investors to expect more conflicting reports, both positive and negative about the Greek crisis. \u201cWe have no idea how this will end,\u201d he added. Time is running out fast, with Greece\u2019s eurozone bailout set to expire on Tuesday, alongside the IMF payment. The Tuesday deadline is doubly pressing because the ECB, which is keeping the Greek banking system on life support, has indicated it will not support banks if the bailout programme expires without a new agreement in place. Without ECB support, Greek banks are expected to buckle, which would force the Tsipras government to impose capital controls and threaten an exit from the eurozone. The ECB, which is holding daily meetings on Greece, has pumped about \u20ac89bn into the Greek financial system to keep banks afloat. On Thursday it decided to maintain emergency liquidity funding at current levels, suggesting that the pace of withdrawals from Greek banks may have ebbed. Even if a deal is finally struck in Brussels, Tsipras has to get the compromise through a rebellious and recalcitrant parliament. Germany\u2019s parliament and those of other eurozone countries also have to ratify the package before it can be implemented, raising questions as to whether all this can be accomplished before the Tuesday deadline. Many observers fear that any deal emerging from Brussels may only be a temporary stopgap that does little to ease the massive debt burden weighing on the Greek economy. \u201cWithout a substantial form of debt relief, which looks unlikely in an initial agreement, Greece\u2019s debt ratio will remain unsustainably high and the crisis will continue,\u201d said Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics.",

Syriza Sweeps to Power - Yanis Varoufakis Appointed as Finance Minister: 25 January 2015 The anti-austerity far-left party Syriza wins the Greek election by a decisive margin, but is just short of an outright majority. Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras says his party\u2019s victory marks an end to the \u201cvicious cycle of austerity\u201d. The new prime minister appoints as finance minister the radical economist Yanis Varoufakis, who has described austerity programmes as \u201cfiscal waterboarding\u201d. Varoufakis, known for turning up to meetings on a motorbike and for his brightly coloured shirts, quickly garners international media attention for more than just his economic views after a tie-less tour of European capitals to meet his EU counterparts. 19. Default Fears Raise Again as Greece Granted Four-Month Extension: 2 March, 2015 Greece secures a eurozone bailout extension for four months after Tsipras bows to German-led pressure to stick to the broad terms of the rescue package. But with a heavy schedule of debt repayments due in the months ahead, fears continue to rise that Greece will default unless its international creditors release the \u20ac7.2bn remaining to be tapped from the bailout funds. 20. Debt Talks Enter Dramatic New Phase: 24-30 June 2015 Greece managed to delay big repayments due to the IMF this month by bundling them together so that \u20ac1.6bn is due on 30 June. After a tense fortnight in which IMF negotiators walk out of bailout talks and meetings with European creditors yield no progress, hopes hang on marathon talks this week to reach a deal that will unlock bailout funds to Greece ahead of the end-of-month deadline. Deposits continue to flood out of Greek banks and the financial system is kept afloat by support from the EC B.",

    "webTitle": "CEO pay at US\u2019s largest companies up 54% since recovery began in 2009", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Psst \u2026 want to earn a CEO\u2019s hourly wage? You can. You\u2019ll just have to toil for about five weeks to do it, without a single day off. According to the latest annual survey by the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, CEOs at the 350 largest companies in the country pocketed an average of $16.3m in compensation each last year. That\u2019s up 3.9% from 2013, and a whopping gain of 54.3% since the recovery began in 2009. The average annual earnings of employees at those companies? Well, that was only $53,200. And in 2009, when the recovery began? Well, that was $53,200, too. In other words, while the CEOs have seen their compensation soar by 54%, the typical worker\u2019s paycheck hasn\u2019t budged. You\u2019d expect to see a gap between the earnings of the guy who is responsible for running the business and those that work there, of course; that would just reflect the greater burden on the former for keeping the whole show on the road (and the fact that if he doesn\u2019t, his tenure can end very rapidly). Then, too, a CEO often is either a senior industry executive with considerable experience or, in the case of a smaller business or startup, its founder, who has put his own capital and reputation on the line to get the company going and keep it afloat. But it\u2019s the size of the gap that is the real problem, especially when set against the stagnation of employee salaries. Right now, the average CEO compensation package is 303 times the size of the average earnings of their employees. The late management consultant Peter Drucker (who, as a winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, was no foe of capitalism) recommended that a CEO-to-worker pay ratio should never top 25; otherwise, he argued, they would \u201cincrease employee resentment and decrease morale\u201d. By 2005, when Drucker died, the ratio was closing in on 400:1. Employee resentment? Check. Low morale? Check. But neither has mattered much to the compensation committees signing off on CEO packages \u2013 and still failing to disclose publicly the size of their specific gap. While the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act required companies to provide information on the CEO pay ratio to their investors (and thus, to the general public), and the Securities and Exchange Commission made a specific proposal about how that might be handled, opposition has ensured that so far, it hasn\u2019t seen the light of day. Shareholders \u2013 the folks in a position to push for this to happen \u2013 don\u2019t seem to put altering this state of affairs at the top of their wish lists. Perhaps that\u2019s because they, unlike the employees stuck with wages that have flat-lined, are enjoying profits of their own, in the form of soaring stock prices. Six years into the bull market, stock indexes have continued to set new records this year, with even the Nasdaq Composite Index posting new all-time highs, finally breaking above the levels it recorded in the dotcom bubble years. As one 2005 academic study found, investors \u2013 whose representatives on the board of directors have the final say on CEO compensation \u2013 seem to become complacent during bull markets, indifferent to how rich CEOs, too, are getting, as long as they are sharing in the riches. Of course, the bull market also is one of the reasons for those big paydays for CEOs. In fact, it\u2019s probably the single largest reason for the explosion in the CEO pay gap. In 1978, when the idea of giving a CEO the majority of his compensation in the form of stock was almost non-existent, that CEO earned about 30 times what his average employee did. By 1989, when the idea of stock-based compensation was gaining traction (and activist investors and corporate raiders were taking aim at corporate managers they considered fat, lazy and unmotivated to increase returns for shareholders), the figure was closing in on 60. By 2000, getting a significant portion (or most) of one\u2019s compensation in stock, option grants or deferred grants of equity was standard, and the gap was 376, according to the EPI. Consider the controversial pay package that Jamie Dimon earned in 2014, for the bank\u2019s 2013 performance. JP Morgan Chase\u2019s board awarded him $20m that year, or less than $1m for every $1bn in regulatory fines and penalties that the bank had to pay. But defenders of the pay package pointed out that of that sum, $18.5m was in the form of restricted stock grants, which the board could cancel later, if other problems emerge. This year, Dimon got the same $20m, of which only $1.5m was in the form of a salary - $7.5m came in the shape of a cash bonus and $11.1m in restricted stock. You can\u2019t separate the question of CEO pay from the stock market. Rewarding with CEOs stock and options provides them with an incentive to boost the stock price \u2013 and it conserves cash. If the company has to issue more stock down the road to swap those options for shares in the business \u2013 something that existing shareholders usually don\u2019t like \u2013 the idea is that by then the shares would have gone up in value so much that grumbling would be minimal. And that has spilled over into the broader wage gap. The more affluent you are, the more likely you are to own stocks \u2013 and to have participated in the post-2009 stock market rally, and to have become wealthier from your investments, even if your salary was stagnant. If you lost a job during the recession and remained unemployed, or never earned enough to invest at all, then you couldn\u2019t afford to buy at the bargain basement prices in the spring of 2009, and may even have had to sell at that time in order to cover mortgage payments, pay college tuition for your kids, or buy groceries. In contrast, wealthier families, with more of a cash cushion, could afford to set aside spare money to continue investing. Studies have shown that these phenomena have resulted in the top 1% getting richer, and doing so at the expense of the rest of us. The authors of those studies, meanwhile, argue that\u2019s not good for the economy, since the CEOs and others don\u2019t add economic value in exchange for all their extra riches. Some of those who have campaigned for higher minimum wages celebrated when Walmart announced it would boost its starting wage to at least $9 an hour. The problem, as Ralph Nader pointed out two years ago, is that Walmart\u2019s CEO made (at that point) $11,000 an hour. The bigger problem is that we even deceive ourselves about how big this wage gap is. The biggest problem of all is what to do about it. In the short term, if stock ownership is the route to affluence or financial security, and given that Americans are woefully unprepared for retirement, why shouldn\u2019t companies routinely supplement their employees\u2019 salaries with stock bonuses in the same way that they do those of their CEOs? Why not grant a Walmart employee 100 shares of stock at the end of every calendar year, in some kind of retirement account? If that idea is too daring, employees and shareholders could at least push for their companies to disclose the CEO pay gap, as provided for in the Dodd-Frank Act, and to explain why they shouldn\u2019t earn a mere 100 times the salary of their employees. My favorite idea, however, is for an individual shareholder to stand up at each annual meeting next spring, and ask the CEO to describe what they do in a typical hour of their working day. The follow up question, of course, would a request for the CEO to explain just why that\u2019s worth (based on the very generous assumption that they\u2019re working 10 hours a day, 365 days a year) about $18,607, each and every hour, according to the EPI data. The answers might be risible; they might be revelatory. They\u2019ll certainly fuel future debate and discussion.",

      "body": "<p>Psst \u2026 want to earn a CEO\u2019s hourly wage? You can. You\u2019ll just have to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alyssalynn7/status/613342494881923072/photo/1\">toil for about five weeks to do it</a>, without a single day off.</p> <p> According to the <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/blog/top-ceo-compensation-soars-and-why-we-do-not-look-at-average-ceos/\">latest annual survey</a> by the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, CEOs at the 350 largest companies in the country pocketed an average of $16.3m in compensation each last year. That\u2019s up 3.9% from 2013, and a whopping gain of 54.3% since the recovery began in 2009. </p> <p> The average annual earnings of employees at those companies? Well, that was only $53,200. And in 2009, when the recovery began? Well, <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/top-ceos-make-300-times-more-than-workers-pay-growth-surpasses-market-gains-and-the-rest-of-the-0-1-percent/\">that was $53,200, too.</a> In other words, while the CEOs have seen their compensation soar by 54%, the typical worker\u2019s paycheck hasn\u2019t budged.</p> <p> You\u2019d expect to see a gap between the earnings of the guy who is responsible for running the business and those that work there, of course; that would just reflect the greater burden on the former for keeping the whole show on the road (and the fact that if he doesn\u2019t, his tenure can end very rapidly). Then, too, a CEO often is either a senior industry executive with considerable experience or, in the case of a smaller business or startup, its founder, who has put his own capital and reputation on the line to get the company going and keep it afloat. </p> <p> But it\u2019s the size of the gap that is the real problem, especially when set against the stagnation of employee salaries. </p> <p>Right now, the average CEO compensation package is 303 times the size of the average earnings of their employees. The late management consultant Peter Drucker (who, as a winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, was no foe of capitalism) recommended that a CEO-to-worker pay ratio <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2008-09-12/put-a-cap-on-ceo-paybusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice\">should never top 25</a>; otherwise, he argued, they would \u201cincrease employee resentment and decrease morale\u201d. By 2005, when Drucker died, the ratio was closing in on 400:1. </p> <p> Employee resentment? Check. Low morale? Check. But neither has mattered much to the compensation committees signing off on CEO packages \u2013 and still failing to disclose publicly the size of their specific gap. While the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act required companies to provide information on the CEO pay ratio to their investors (and thus, to the general public), and the Securities and Exchange Commission made a specific proposal about how that might be handled, opposition has ensured that so far, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/business/despite-federal-regulation-ceo-worker-pay-gap-data-remains-hidden.html\">it hasn\u2019t seen the light of day</a>.</p> <p> Shareholders \u2013 the folks in a position to push for this to happen \u2013 don\u2019t seem to put altering this state of affairs at the top of their wish lists. Perhaps that\u2019s because they, unlike the employees stuck with wages that have flat-lined, are enjoying profits of their own, in the form of soaring stock prices. Six years into the bull market, stock indexes have <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-23/u-s-stock-index-futures-advance-with-s-p-500-near-record-high\">continued to set new records this year</a>, with even the Nasdaq Composite Index posting new all-time highs, finally breaking above the levels it recorded in the dotcom bubble years. </p> <p> As one <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w11443.pdf\">2005 academic study</a> found, investors \u2013 whose representatives on the board of directors have the final say on CEO compensation \u2013 seem to become complacent during bull markets, indifferent to how rich CEOs, too, are getting, as long as they are sharing in the riches. </p> <p> Of course, the bull market also is one of the reasons for those big paydays for CEOs. In fact, it\u2019s probably the single largest reason for the explosion in the CEO pay gap. In 1978, when the idea of giving a CEO the majority of his compensation in the form of stock was almost non-existent, that CEO earned about 30 times what his average employee did. By 1989, when the idea of stock-based compensation was gaining traction (and activist investors and corporate raiders were taking aim at corporate managers they considered fat, lazy and unmotivated to increase returns for shareholders), the figure was closing in on 60. By 2000, getting a significant portion (or most) of one\u2019s compensation in stock, option grants or deferred grants of equity was standard, and the gap was 376, according to the EPI. </p> <p> Consider the controversial pay package that Jamie Dimon earned in 2014, for the bank\u2019s 2013 performance. JP Morgan Chase\u2019s board awarded him $20m that year, or <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/business/accounting-for-jamie-dimons-big-pay-raise.html\">less than $1m for every $1bn in regulatory fines and penalties that the bank had to pay</a>.
