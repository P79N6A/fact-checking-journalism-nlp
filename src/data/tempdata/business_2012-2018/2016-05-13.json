      "bodyText": "The European commission has launched an inquiry into Chinese subsidies for steel sold to the EU after European steelmakers warned that dumping was likely to increase. The inquiry is based on a submission from the European Steel Association (Eurofer), claiming that Chinese producers benefit from government subsidies such as preferential lending rates and low energy charges. The subsidies have allowed Chinese companies to export to the EU at prices that damage European steel producers, the association said. The European commission said Eurofer had also provided credible evidence that imports would increase soon as China diverts steel to the EU from the US and other countries that have clamped down on dumping. The inquiry is the first move announced by the commission since Tata Steel revealed its decision to pull out of the UK, directly threatening about 12,000 steelmaking jobs and many more that rely on the sector. The investigation was launched under a new \u201cthreat of injury\u201d mechanism. This does not require proof of injury before proceedings start. The commission said it decided to act early, \u201cmotivated by the threat that continuation of imports under current conditions might cause economic damage to the EU industry\u201d. UK steel producers and unions partly blame imports of cheap Chinese steel, prompted by a slowdown in the Chinese economy, for the crisis in the industry. The commission\u2019s investigation will cover imports of hot-rolled products of iron, non-alloy or other alloy steel from China. Eurofer said it lodged its complaint to test whether the commission can come up with a tariff to counteract China\u2019s subsidies. If not, it said, the commission needs to strengthen its anti-dumping efforts. Brussels is already investigating dumping of Chinese steel in the EU and has imposed 15 measures to deal with the practice. But Eurofer said it should consider dropping the lesser-duty rule, which restricts punitive tariffs on dumped goods. The UK government has called for tougher action from the commission but has opposed scrapping the lesser-duty rule, partly because it could have increased prices for British shoppers. Eurofer has criticised the UK for resisting the change and taking a softer line against dumping than the US. Eurofer said: \u201cThe anti-dumping tool is the EU\u2019s most effective trade defence measure. The anti-subsidy tool tends to be relatively ineffective and harder to deploy as subsidies are more difficult to detect and more complex. This is why Eurofer has been pushing for wholesale reform of Europe\u2019s trade defence instruments.\u201d China\u2019s steel exports to the EU have more than doubled since 2013 from 3m tonnes a year to almost 7m tonnes as producers have sought to offload surplus stocks, according to Eurofer. China\u2019s overcapacity of at least 340m tonnes is double the entire capacity of Europe\u2019s steel industry, it added. The UK government is trying to find a buyer for Tata Steel UK, which includes the giant blast furnace at Port Talbot, south Wales. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, has stepped up efforts to support the industry after being accusations of complacency early in the steel crisis. He said the commission\u2019s investigation could speed up European action to stop Chinese dumping of steel. \u201cThis is welcome news for British steel, particularly Port Talbot which produces nearly a million tonnes of this type of steel every year,. It\u2019s exactly the action we have been pushing hard for in Europe and this type of investigation, the first of its kind, means anti-dumping tariffs can be imposed much earlier.\u201d Britain\u2019s steel industry has accused the commission of acting too slowly to cut off cheap Chinese imports that have sent the price of steel plunging and put UK producers at risk. Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, the British industry lobby, said: \u201cThis is a welcome and much needed investigation into Chinese government subsidies which will run in parallel with the investigation into dumping of steel into the EU. The commission and member states must commit to using all the measures available to tackle this problem in the short term. \u201cThe commission should take this opportunity to revamp the way it operates and speed up its investigation to ensure that it tackles the problem in the shortest possible time.\u201d The commission said it could take up to nine months before deciding whether to take action against Chinese subsidies. A spokesman said it would impose further anti-dumping measures and was ready to speed up its procedures to deal with the crisis.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A vote to leave the EU next month could precipitate a stock market crash and steep fall in house prices, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Christine Lagarde, the IMF managing director, also backed warnings from the Bank of England governor Mark Carney that Britain could fall into recession following a Brexit vote. Lagarde, who was in London on Friday to present the fund\u2019s annual health check on the UK economy, said it was possible the economy would shrink in two consecutive quarters, which is the definition of a recession. \u201cWe have looked at all the scenarios. We have done our homework and we haven\u2019t found anything positive to say about a Brexit vote,\u201d she said. The IMF said a panic among investors would trigger shockwaves throughout the economy following a vote to leave, sending shares and property prices into downward spiral. In a report that is clearly helpful to campaigners for Britain to remain in the EU, the it said that even over the longer term growth would be depressed. Vote Leave reacted angrily to the findings, which it said were part of a plan by the government \u201cto circumvent purdah rules by using the IMF, which is funded by the EU and the UK government\u201d. The Brexit campaign accused the Washington-based organisation of being \u201cconsistently wrong about its forecasts for the UK economy\u201d and said it was wrong again on Britain leaving the EU. It also attacked Lagarde\u2019s reputation saying it was sullied by criminal allegations of negligence over \u20ac400m (\u00a3314m) of payments in the Bernard Tapie affair, dating back to when she was French finance minister. The Tory MP Priti Patel said: \u201cThe IMF warned Britain it was playing with fire when it set out a plan to deal with the deficit. Now our economy is stronger than nearly every other major economy. Today, the IMF is talking down Britain because we want to take back control from Brussels. They were wrong then and they are wrong now. \u201cThe EU-funded IMF should not interfere in our democratic debate weeks before polling day. It appears the chancellor is cashing in favours to Ms Lagarde in order to encourage the IMF to bully the British people \u2013 it is a sign of the desperation in the in campaign.\u201d The IMF\u2019s warning was coupled with a prediction that a vote to remain in the EU would spur a rebound in growth in the second half of the year, ending more than 12 months of stagnant output and falling business confidence. But it painted a gloomy picture of the potential fallout from a vote to leave. \u201cMarkets may anticipate such adverse economic effects. This could entail sharp drops in equity and house prices, increased borrowing costs for households and businesses, and even a sudden stop of investment inflows into key sectors such as commercial real estate and finance,\u201d it said. \u201cThe UK\u2019s record-high current account deficit and attendant reliance on external financing exacerbates these risks. Such market reactions could sharply contract economic activity, further depressing asset prices in a self-reinforcing cycle.\u201d Lagarde said countries across the whole world were concerned about the impact of a UK vote to leave the EU on their own economies and the global situation. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a country I have visited in the last six months that hasn\u2019t asked me what we think the impact of Brexit will be,\u201d she said. She said there was a \u201chuge amount of anxiety\u201d that made it legitimate for the IMF to carry out an assessment of the risks. Lagarde added that the timing of the report was not significant and fitted with publishing a detailed analysis of the UK economy before the IMF board meeting in the autumn. \u201cWe are not doing it out of politics,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not how the IMF works.\u201d The IMF said there would only be a limited boost for net exports caused by an abrupt sterling depreciation and this would only partly offset the hit to GDP from reduced consumption and investment. The report added that inflation could also rise well above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target at some point. Seema Malhotra MP, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said a series of economic reports showed it was \u201cvital for our security and prosperity that we vote to remain\u201d. She said: \u201cThere\u2019s a broad consensus that walking away from Europe will hit the British economy hard and that it will be costly for British families and businesses. \u201cThat\u2019s the message from international bodies \u2013 the IMF and the OECD and from the Treasury and the CBI. The employer\u2019s organisation says there would be nearly a million lost jobs. The Treasury says that over 10 years the cost per family could be \u00a34,300.\u201d The IMF said a vote to stay would benefit the economy after a turbulent few months which have seen sterling fall by 8% and wages growth slow. \u201cIn the event of a vote to remain in the EU, growth is expected to rebound during the second half of the year,\u201d it said. \u201cAs anticipated, the slower first half, and some lingering referendum-related effects, mean that growth is likely to fall below 2% for the full year 2016, before returning to an average of around 2.25% over the medium term, roughly in line with potential. \u201cInflation, which is currently only 0.5%, is expected to revert to target gradually, as effects from commodity price falls dissipate and low unemployment helps push up wages.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "US retail sales rise and consumer confidence jumps - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The number of oil rigs in use in the US has dropped for the eighth week in a row. Total rig numbers dropped by 9 to 406, according to the weekly Baker Hughes rig count. Of this, 10 oil rigs were cut, but one gas rig was added. This was the lowest level since October 2009, as companies concentrated on completing existing wells rather than drilling new ones. The oil price, which was already in negative territory, was little changed after the figures, with Brent crude now down 0.79% at $47.7. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Despite a mixed bag of economic data, European shares have ended the week on a positive note. There were some poor UK construction figures, while European growth figures were revised down, albeit by less than feared. The news from the US was better, with positive retail sales and confidence figures providing some support for markets. Investors even took the latest warnings on Brexit - this time from the IMF - in their stride. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 34.31 points or 0.56% at 6138.5, just avoiding its fourth weekly fall in succession Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.92% to 9952.90 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.62% to 4319.99 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.44% to 17,729.45 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.67% at 8721.5 But in Greece, the Athens market fell 1.59% to 622.71 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 47 points or 0.27%. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has confirmed its ratings on Italy with a stable outlook. The agency said: We project that Italy\u2019s economic recovery will stay on track, despite having revised downward our forecast for real GDP growth to 1.1% in 2016 and 1.3% in 2017 (from 1.3% and 1.4% in our previous review). We view as positive, recent initiatives to support Italian banks and reduce the high level of nonperforming loans in the banking sector, although we believe they alone may not be sufficient to fully address the related challenges. We are affirming our long- and short-term sovereign credit ratings on the Republic of Italy at \u2018BBB-/A-3\u2019. The stable outlook reflects our expectation that the Italian government will continue to implement comprehensive and potentially growth-enhancing structural and budgetary reforms that will stabilise, and start reducing, the very high public debt ratio. The dollar has continued to strengthen following the better than expected US data, despite analysts still not convinced the country\u2019s economy is strong enough for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June meeting. Against the pound, the US currency is currently at a three week high of $1.4343, up around 0.8% on the day. Brexit worries are also weakening sterling, with the IMF\u2019s statements the latest in a serious of dire warnings about the impact of the UK leaving the EU. Despite the strong US data today, the Federal Reserve may still decide not to hike rates in Junes, says James Knightley at ING Bank: [The sentiment data] bodes well for consumer spending in 2Q16, particularly after the stronger than expected April retail sales report. While many at the Fed are keen to tighten monetary policy further we still feel that June is perhaps a little too early given the softness in data seen earlier in the year. We instead continue to favour a 3Q rate hike. Following the better than expected US retail sales figures comes news that consumer confidence is higher than forecast so far this month. The University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment rose from 89 in April to 95.8 in a preliminary reading for May. Analysts had expected a rise to 90. This is the highest reading since June 2015. The survey compilers said: Consumer sentiment rebounded in early May due to more frequent income gains, an improved jobs outlook, and the expectation of lower inflation and interest rates. The largest gains were recorded among lower income and younger households, although the gains were recorded among all income and age subgroups as well as across all regions. Nearly all of the gains were in the Expectations Index, which rose to its highest level in nearly a year. To be sure, the data still indicated the negative impact of uncertainty about future economic policies associated with the Presidential election, but its overall impact was overwhelmed by favourable economic developments. It is too early to judge the potential impact of the election on consumers\u2019 expectations, and one month\u2019s rebound in consumer confidence is insufficient to increase the current forecast for inflation-adjusted consumer expenditures from 2.5% during 2016. And the Slovak finance minister has called for a swift agreement, with or without the IMF: Greece and its creditors are close to agreeing a basic package of measures worth \u20ac5.4bn, paving the way for a loan tranche of some \u20ac10bn to be released, according to the Athens-Macedonia-News Agency. Here are the percentage changes in retail sales from the previous month: More on the US retail sales. The better than expected figures have eased some concerns about the state of the US economy, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco: The number comes as a real relief for investors as it rounds off a week which has brought a lot of pain for US retailers. Department store operators Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom posted weak earnings and slashed their forward guidance for the rest of the year. This comes on top of a number of high profile retail bankruptcies including American Apparel, Quicksilver and Aeropostale. All of this goes to demonstrate the US consumer\u2019s unwillingness (or inability) to spend money, particularly on clothes and accessories. This is particularly worrying as consumer spending is widely accepted as accounting for over 70% of all US economic activity. If the recent disappointing news on payrolls and jobless claims proves to be the start of a trend rather than a blip, then there could be worse to come. But today\u2019s retail sales numbers go some way to offsetting these concerns. Steve Murphy, US economist at Capital Economics, said: The retail sales report shows that recent claims of the demise of the US consumer have been greatly exaggerated. Thanks to a massive 0.9% month on month gain in control sales in April and a sizeable rebound in motor vehicle sales, it now appears that second-quarter GDP growth will be close to 3.0% annualised... At this stage, a June rate hike is a toss-up. The activity data certainly warrants a hike, but separately we are becoming worried that May\u2019s employment figures could be pulled down by a couple of big temporary factors. Given how cautious the Yellen-led Fed has shown itself to be, the decision next month could go either way. US markets have opened roughly flat, just a touch into the red: Dow Jones: -0.1% at 17,703 S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 2,062 Nasdaq: -0.1% at 4,731 Most major European markets are up this afternoon, but the FTSE 100 is off slightly. Christine Lagarde\u2019s warning this morning that Brexit would send shockwaves through the UK economy - prompting the stock market and house prices to crash - is not helping sentiment. James Knightley, economist at ING, says that the jump in US retail sales won\u2019t be enough to convince the Federal Reserve it\u2019s time to raise interest rates just yet. This report is likely to generate some encouraging headlines suggesting a bounceback in consumer activity, and it certainly is good news. However, the Federal Reserve will want to make sure it isn\u2019t just a one-off. With other activity indicators suggesting that there has been something of a loss of momentum over the past twelve months we still favour just one-rate rise this year, which will most likely come in the third quarter of 2016. We continue to doubt that the Fed will hike in June. This partly reflect the need for a better run of data, but also external risks. One of those is Brexit \u2013 should the UK vote to leave the EU on June 23rd this could see both the euro and sterling tumble against the dollar, which will lead to a tightening of financial conditions that may deter the Fed from tightening policy. The monthly 1.3% jump in April retail sales was the biggest increase in more than a year. The number for March was also revised up, to show a 0.3% rise and not the 0.4% drop previously estimated. The increase was broad-based across different kinds of goods, but car sales were particularly strong. Breaking: US retail sales jumped 1.3% in April, beating expectations of a 0.8% increase. Excluding cars, sales were up 0.8%, again beating expectations of a 0.5% increase. The figures will bring relief to worried investors... US stock index futures are lower as investors await April retail sales data from the world\u2019s largest economy. Economists are expecting to see a 0.8% rise in US retail sales over the month, and will be closely watching when the figures are published at 13.30 UK time. Weak earnings from retailers - including department store Macy\u2019s - have put investors on edge, not least because consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of the US economy. John McDonnell has had a word to say about the weak UK construction numbers. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor said: It is deeply disappointing that despite George Osborne\u2019s rhetoric on construction the industry shrank by 1.1 per cent in the first quarter of the year. Output in the construction industry has fallen since Osborne claimed at last year\u2019s Tory party conference that \u2018we are the builders\u2019, and comes on the back of ONS figures earlier this week showing UK industrial production in recession. This is further evidence that Osborne\u2019s recovery is one built on sand. Most international business would like the UK to stay in the EU, according to an Ipsos Mori poll. Most companies - 78% - from seven countries including Germany and China said Brexit would be negative and lead them to cut investment. Only 5% felt it would be positive for their business, and the rest said the impact would be neutral or they didn\u2019t know. The countries involved were France, Canada, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Germany and China. Michael O\u2019Leary, Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, has also been speaking about Brexit and the potential impact. He says fares would probably drop in the shorter term, comparing the impact in terms of air travel to other crises, including 9/11. Reuters quotes O\u2019Leary: After 9/11, after every crisis Ryanair is selling cheaper fares, we keep people flying. So the fact is we would have a downward effect on our pricing for 6 to 12 months, but we will keep people flying. O\u2019Leary said that over the longer term, Brexit would prompt Ryanair to move investments out of the UK. The longer term effect is we will invest less in the UK. We will certainly switch some of our existing UK investment into other European countries because we want to continue to invest in the European Union and it will bad for air travel and British tourism. Lagarde has also been making the point today that Brexit is not purely a domestic issue. I know it is a big domestic issue for many of you, but it\u2019s an international issue. I don\u2019t think that in the last six months, I have visited a country anywhere in the world where I have not been asked: \u2018what will be the economic consequences of Brexit. And in addition to Greece, Ukraine and a few others, what will be the outcome if the UK was to leave the European Union. You will appreciate the level of anxiety there is around the world as a result of that particular potential decision. George Osborne has been speaking following the IMF\u2019s damning report on the potential impact of Brexit. He said the Fund makes it clear a UK exit from EU would \u201ccost us money\u201d. That\u2019s less to spend on public services like schools and the NHS. Lagarde insists the IMF\u2019s view on Brexit is completely independent. IMF boss Christine Lagarde says IMF will complete a more comprehensive report on the impact of Brexit in time for the Fund\u2019s next board meeting on 15 June. This will include more detailed numbers. \u201cIf there are no leaks, the papers should get it on the 16th, 17th\u201d, she says. Different location, same story. On Thursday it was Mark Carney sitting in Threadneedle Street issuing a warning from the Bank of England about the perils of Brexit. Less than 24 hours later it was Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund delivering the same message. The approach being taken by the Government to the referendum appears to be similar to the tactics adopted by the British high command on the Western Front during the Great War: soften up the enemy with a constant and ferocious pounding. Opinion polls suggest that the pounding is having only a limited effect, with the Brexiteers snug in their positions and largely oblivious to the ordnance being rained down on them. The Government\u2019s hope is that eventually the war of attrition will pay off, as perhaps it might. Lagarde certainly went for what she sees as a soft spot in the enemy\u2019s defences - the risk that a no vote on June 23 could lead to a crash in house prices. This is a cunning tactic. While there is scant evidence that the British public is moved by the difference between the Swiss model, the Norwegian model or the WTO model when it comes to Britain\u2019s post-EU trading arrangements, the threat to house prices is a different matter altogether. (Full comment here.) Christine Lagarde is now addressing journalists at the Treasury. The IMF appears to have considerably stepped up its warning on the impact of Brexit. Phillip Inman, the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent, reports: A stock market crash and steep fall in house prices could follow a vote to leave the EU, the International Monetary Fund warned on Friday. A panic among investors about the future path of the UK economy would trigger shockwaves throughout the economy, it warned, sending shares and property prices into a spin. In a report that is clearly helpful to campaigners for Britian to remain in the EU, the IMF said that over the longer term, growth would be depressed. The stark warning was coupled with analysis that found a vote to remain in the EU would spur a rebound in growth in the second half of the year, bringing to an end more than a year of stagnant output and falling business confidence. Full story here. Eurozone growth for the first quarter has been revised down slightly, to 0.5% from an initial estimate of 0.6%. It followed 0.3% growth in the final quarter of 2015. Annual growth slowed slightly, to 1.5% from 1.6% in the previous quarter. The International Monetary Fund is wading back in to the Brexit debate. In it\u2019s annual health check of the UK economy, the IMF says that the British public are facing \u201ca momentous decision\u201d over the country\u2019s membership of the EU. Brexit, it says, is the biggest risk to the UK economy. The IMF had already put its boot firmly in the Remain camp, and strengthens its warning today. A vote to leave, the IMF says, would hit growth, lower living standards, and prompt market volatility. Britain would be adversely affected in the short-term, but in the longer term too. Extracts from the report: The largest risks and uncertainties relate to the upcoming EU referendum. A vote to leave the EU would create uncertainty about the nature of the UK\u2019s long-term economic relationship with the EU and the rest of the world. A vote for exit would precipitate a protracted period of heightened uncertainty, leading to financial market volatility and a hit to output. The long-run effects on UK output and incomes would also likely be negative and substantial. London\u2019s status as a global financial center could also be eroded, as UK-based firms may lose their \u201cpassporting\u201d rights to provide financial services to the rest of the EU and much euro- denominated business may over time move to the continent. IMF head Christine Lagarde is due to speak shortly. The sharp fall in construction output in March means that the sector contracted by 1.1% in the first quarter overall. Last month, when the ONS published its first estimate of Q1 growth (0.4%), it pencilled in a smaller drop in construction output of 0.9%. That was before it had the data for March. In the first quarter, all new building work fell by 0.6%, while repair and maintenance dropped 1.9%. House building was the bright spot, growing by 4.8% in the first quarter. Infrastructure fell 5.6%. Breaking news: A shocking number for UK construction output - down 3.6%. It was a much sharper fall than the 2.5% drop forecast by economists, and followed a 0.3% drop in February according to the Office for National Statistics. One way of looking at it: Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, was paid \u00a34.6m including a \u00a33m bonus after the crisis-hit supermarket returned to profit. The payout was revealed in Tesco\u2019s annual report. The UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain made a pre-tax profit of \u00a3167m in the year to 27 February, after making the biggest ever high street loss the years before - \u00a36.4bn. Read our full story on the payout here. As Tesco\u2019s new boss in 2014, Lewis has had to deal with Tesco\u2019s \u00a3263m accounting scandal, which came to light just weeks after he took over from ousted boss Philip Clarke. Hear from the man himself: Oil is down on a stronger dollar and a warning from Russia that a global oversupply of crude could last into next year. The dollar has recovered by about 2.5% from its May lows against a basket of leading currencies. Oil is traded in dollars so the stronger the currency, the more expensive fuel imports are for countries using other currencies. Brent crude is down 0.7% at $47.76 a barrel. US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 54 cents or 1.2% at $4616 a barrel. Will there be any horror stories for markets on Friday 13th? Germany\u2019s better than expected growth has failed to cheer investors this morning. General fears of a potential global slowdown and an empty central bank tool box to deal with it appear to be weighing on investor sentiment. Mark Carney\u2019s comments on Brexit at the inflation report press conference on Thursday will not have helped. The Bank of England governor said the economy could slide back into recession should the UK vote to leave the EU. Europe\u2019s major markets are all down this morning. The FTSE 100 is down 29 points or 0.5% at 6,075. Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING, describes Germany\u2019s economic performance over recent months as \u201cvery impressive\u201d. Brzeski believes the makeup of Europe\u2019s largest economy is changing. Is Germany losing its industrial might? During this lucky streak, the growth drivers have changed. Initially boosted by strong industrial production and exports, the economy is currently much more driven by private consumption, construction and a bit of exports. The industrial backbone has weakened significantly. Looking ahead, at least in the near term, this new growth mix should further support growth. Brzeski also believes Germany might be getting a little complacent about its growth credentials: Today\u2019s data are another sign of Germany\u2019s economic strength. At least at first glance. The economy defied the financial market turmoil at the start of the year as well as the Chinese slowdown. Even if many Germans don\u2019t want to hear it, strong domestic activity is also the result of the ECB\u2019s loose monetary policy. At second glance, however, the strong growth performance also shows what currently is the biggest risk for the German economy: complacency. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Some upbeat news to kickstart the day. The German economy grew by 0.7% in the first quarter, more than double the 0.3% growth rate in the previous quarter. Economists polled by Reuters were expecting a 0.6% increase in GDP in the first three months of the year. Destatis, the German statistics office, said growth was driven by domestic demand, with households and the government both spending more over the period. Foreign trade on the other hand was a drag on growth, with imports rising more sharply than exports. The construction sector was boosted by the mild winter weather. Destatis said: The quarter-on-quarter comparison \u2013 following price, seasonal and calendar adjustment \u2013 shows that positive contributions mainly came from domestic demand, according to provisional calculations. The final consumption expenditure of both households and general government increased at the beginning of the year. Capital formation was higher, too. Due to the continued mild weather, fixed capital formation in construction as well as machinery and equipment was markedly up compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. Later this morning Eurostat will give a second take on eurozone growth in the first quarter, following an initial estimate of 0.6% growth. Investors will be relieved that Germany, it\u2019s largest economy, did not deliver any nasty shocks to the downside. Also this morning, the head of the IMF Christine Lagarde will deliver the IMF\u2019s latest verdict on the UK at a press conference at the Treasury. We will keep you updated on events throughout the day.",

Analysts had expected a rise to 90.</p> <p>This is the highest reading since June 2015.</p> <p>The survey compilers said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Consumer sentiment rebounded in early May due to more frequent income gains, an improved jobs outlook, and the expectation of lower inflation and interest rates. The largest gains were recorded among lower income and younger households, although the gains were recorded among all income and age subgroups as well as across all regions.</p> <p> Nearly all of the gains were in the Expectations Index, which rose to its highest level in nearly a year. To be sure, the data still indicated the negative impact of uncertainty about future economic policies associated with the Presidential election, but its overall impact was overwhelmed by favourable economic developments. It is too early to judge the potential impact of the election on consumers\u2019 expectations, and one month\u2019s rebound in consumer confidence is insufficient to increase the current forecast for inflation-adjusted consumer expenditures from 2.5% during 2016. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f5ba15569433037febb12b47ce927266e78312d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f5ba15569433037febb12b47ce927266e78312d/0_0_717_464/500.jpg\" alt=\"Consumer sentiment index\" width=\"500\" height=\"324\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Consumer sentiment index</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: University of Michigan</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5735dea6e4b032c8f93ba541\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-13T14:03:48.858Z\">3.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And the Slovak finance minister has called for a swift agreement, with or without the IMF:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KazimirPeter/status/731121854841278464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We would like to see a swift agreement unlocking a needed tranche for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a>, with or without the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IMF?src=hash\">#IMF</a> consent if necessary. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/eurozone?src=hash\">#eurozone</a></p>&mdash; Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr (@KazimirPeter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KazimirPeter/status/731121854841278464\">May 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5735dd7ce4b01f9e6c2546f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-13T14:01:38.710Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Greece and its creditors are close to agreeing a basic package of measures worth \u20ac5.4bn, paving the way for a loan tranche of some \u20ac10bn to be released, according to the Athens-Macedonia-News Agency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jameskanter/status/731084066083246081\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Clues emerge on size next payments to Greece: could be \u20ac9bln-\u20ac11bln with support to clear growth-sapping arrears. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eurogroup?src=hash\">#Eurogroup</a> still to decide</p>&mdash; James Kanter (@jameskanter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jameskanter/status/731084066083246081\">May 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferMerode/status/731087541051510785\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Three hurdles before Greece can get next bailout payment: pass laws on 1% savings, EU verification, eurozone approval... all by 24 May.</p>&mdash; Jennifer Rankin (@JenniferMerode) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferMerode/status/731087541051510785\">May 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-13T14:03:10.093Z\">at 3.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5735dbe2e4b01f9e6c2546ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-13T13:52:45.003Z\">2.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the percentage changes in retail sales from the previous month:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f08d6adb9c76e834f2ae13256bcd4148169891f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f08d6adb9c76e834f2ae13256bcd4148169891f/0_0_693_634/500.jpg\" alt=\"Retail sales\" width=\"500\" height=\"457\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Retail sales</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: US Dept of Commerce</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5735d811e4b0285191bb769e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-13T13:39:53.529Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>More on the US retail sales.</strong></p> <p>The better than expected figures have eased some concerns about the state of the US economy, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The number comes as a real relief for investors as it rounds off a week which has brought a lot of pain for US retailers. Department store operators Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom posted weak earnings and slashed their forward guidance for the rest of the year. This comes on top of a number of high profile retail bankruptcies including American Apparel, Quicksilver and Aeropostale. </p> <p> All of this goes to demonstrate the US consumer\u2019s unwillingness (or inability) to spend money, particularly on clothes and accessories. This is particularly worrying as consumer spending is widely accepted as accounting for over 70% of all US economic activity. If the recent disappointing news on payrolls and jobless claims proves to be the start of a trend rather than a blip, then there could be worse to come. But today\u2019s retail sales numbers go some way to offsetting these concerns.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanShepherdson/status/731113385505521664\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"fr\" dir=\"ltr\">April department store sales -2.9% y/y.

The activity data certainly warrants a hike, but separately we are becoming worried that May\u2019s employment figures could be pulled down by a couple of big temporary factors. Given how cautious the Yellen-led Fed has shown itself to be, the decision next month could go either way.</p> </blockquote> <p><a><br></a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5735d5ede4b0285191bb7692\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-13T13:34:01.979Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US markets open slightly down</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have opened roughly flat, just a touch into the red:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Dow Jones: -0.1% at 17,703</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 2,062</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Nasdaq: -0.1% at 4,731</strong></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5735d264e4b0a00e25404cec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-13T13:20:37.553Z\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Most major European markets are up this afternoon, but the FTSE 100 is off slightly.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/imf-warns-stock-market-crash-house-price-fall-eu-referendum-brexit\">Christine Lagarde\u2019s warning this morning that Brexit would send shockwaves through the UK economy</a> - prompting the stock market and house prices to crash - is not helping sentiment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3a83d69d79b63c0ac1d0b675c7d7413c76503fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3a83d69d79b63c0ac1d0b675c7d7413c76503fa/0_0_978_139/500.jpg\" alt=\"ftse down\" width=\"500\" height=\"71\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5735d0abe4b01f9e6c2546cf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-13T13:10:36.629Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>James Knightley, economist at ING, says that the jump in US retail sales won\u2019t be enough to convince the Federal Reserve it\u2019s time to raise interest rates just yet.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This report is likely to generate some encouraging headlines suggesting a bounceback in consumer activity, and it certainly is good news. </p> <p>However, the Federal Reserve will want to make sure it isn\u2019t just a one-off.

Lagarde certainly went for what she sees as a soft spot in the enemy\u2019s defences - the risk that a no vote on June 23 could lead to a crash in house prices.</p> <p>This is a cunning tactic.

      "bodyText": "HSBC has criticised the US secretary of state, John Kerry, for asking European banks to do more business with Iran while Washington continues to restrict American financial firms from doing the same. The bank\u2019s chief legal officer, Stuart Levey, said HSBC had no intention of doing any new business with Iran after a meeting in London on Thursday in which Kerry urged a gathering of European bankers to make a push into the country. The US and European Union lifted sanctions against in Iran in January after the country dismantled 14,000 centrifuges \u2013 two-thirds of its total nuclear capacity \u2013 as part of its obligations under the international deal agreed in Vienna last July. Despite this, the banking industry remains fearful of large financial fines, - the threat of losing crucial licences to operate in the US, for falling foul of regulations. HSBC was fined \u00a31.2bn by the US in 2012 for money laundering offences in relation to Mexico while Standard Chartered was fined more than \u00a3400m for breaching sanctions with Iran. In 2014, French bank BNP Paribas was fined more than \u00a35.2bn for breaching US sanctions. At Thursday\u2019s meeting, Kerry had told representatives from all the major European banks that he wanted to \u201cclarify and put to rest misinterpretations or mere rumours about how [the deal] is applied\u201d. But writing in the Wall Street Journal, Levey said the US government was taking a \u201cvery odd position\u201d. \u201cOn the one hand, Washington is continuing to prohibit American banks and companies from doing Iran-related business \u2026 on the other hand, Mr Kerry wants non-US banks to do business with Iran without a US repudiation of its prior statements about the associated financial-crime risks,\u201d said Levey, who was the undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the US Treasury between 2004 and 2011. While a ban on the use of dollars in the US banking system to finance Iranian trade is still in place, individual US states are adapting to the changes in different ways. Levey, who was not at the meeting with Kerry, said: \u201cThere are no assurances as to how such activity would subsequently be viewed by US regulatory and law-enforcement authorities, which might seek to take enforcement action against banks that enter the Iranian market and run afoul of complicated US restrictions. The State Department neither controls nor plays any meaningful role in the enforcement decisions of these authorities. \u201cWashington has warned repeatedly that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps controls broad swaths of the Iranian economy. The IRGC remains sanctioned by both the US and the EU because of the central role it plays in Iran\u2019s illicit conduct. When the US, EU, and UN removed sanctions from several hundred Iranian banks and companies, there were no assurances that the conduct of those banks and companies had changed. \u201cThis will present a challenge for European banks. HSBC is endeavouring to implement consistent and high standards across its global operations, designed to combat financial crime and prevent abuse by illicit actors. We have more work to do, but achieving that objective is one of our highest priorities. This approach is rightly expected by our regulators, including in the UK and the US. \u201cOur decisions will be driven by the financial-crime risks and the underlying conduct. For these reasons HSBC has no intention of doing any new business involving Iran.\u201d A follow-up meeting has been scheduled for next week in the US. In March, the Times reported that Barclays had been rebuked by the UK government for refusing to process payments from Iranian entities.",

    "webTitle": "The hands behind the heritage: inside the Burberry factory in Yorkshire", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Using swift, sure strokes, Amanda\u2019s strong fingers, one tipped with a thimble, push a needle through tough gaberdine fabric. After more than 20 years in Burberry\u2019s factory in Castleford, Yorkshire, she can stitch a collar in eight minutes \u2013 and so neatly the eventual owner of the trenchcoat she is making will never notice her work. At most, the wearer may be vaguely aware that their coat snugly hugs their neck in a way a standard high-street raincoat never could. On the bright, white walls of the starkly lit room, Cara Delevigne and Eddie Redmayne pose in black and white posters that typify the glamorous image of the British brand. But it is the women toiling on the sewing machines, in jeans, loud T-shirts and gold jewellery who are the real force behind the brand\u2019s famous coat. They stitch 5,000 of the brand\u2019s heritage trenchcoats a week, each garment selling for more than \u00a31,100. The process has been so protected that this is the first time a British journalist has been allowed in to the coat factory in Castleford or Burberry\u2019s textile mill in Cross Hills, a village near Keighley. Even now, no cameras are allowed and the company wants to scrutinise any quotes from staff. It\u2019s no real surprise that Burberry has not been keen to shine a light on its humble UK factories. Between 2007 and 2009, more than 500 British jobs were lost as the designer label cut costs by closing production facilities in Treorchy, Wales, and Rotherham, and trimmed jobs in its Yorkshire factories. But now, under the leadership of Yorkshireman Christopher Bailey, Burberry\u2019s chief creative officer, who also became chief executive in 2014, the company is investing at least \u00a350m in a new factory that could bring 200 more manufacturing jobs to the UK. Labelled Project Artisan, the new facility on the South Bank in Leeds will be the biggest newbuild clothing factory in the UK for at least 50 years \u2013 a statement about the brand\u2019s heritage and values. The focus on British manufacturing is part of Bailey\u2019s fightback plan, expected to be detailed next week when the company reveals its annual financial results. Bailey is under pressure because Burberry\u2019s sales have slowed as luxury-loving Chinese buyers have been put off travelling to Europe by the terrorist attacks in Paris and kept out of Hong Kong, once a shoppers\u2019 paradise, by changes to visa rules. Bailey says: \u201cI\u2019m a great believer in British manufacturing and the crafts and skills we have here. We have 800 incredible craftsmen and women in our two factories in Yorkshire and their tradition is something we should all be proud of, continue to build on, and promote on a world stage. \u201cIn a world that\u2019s changing so dramatically, where everything is getting faster and faster, timeless skills, detailed and quality workmanship becomes more and more important and I am proud we can play a role in promoting that.\u201d Bailey is riding a wave of increasing interest in making textiles and clothing in the UK. Last year the sector saw the first increase in employment for more than 35 years, according to the Office for National Statistics. Plans for Burberry\u2019s new factory, designed by Stirling prize-winning architects Stanton Williams, are still on the drawing board but it is expected to open in late 2018 or 2019. It will combine weaving and coat manufacturing under one roof. Persuading the ladies, and select group of gents, who work in Castleford and Keighley, to travel to nearby Leeds will be an important part of the move. The longest serving employees have worked at Burberry for more than 40 years and many will have to switch from a quick walk to work to a long bus journey. Each member of the team is valuable as it takes a year of practice before sewers can take on the trickiest jobs such as stitching a collar. Trainees start with simple items such as wool capes \u2013 items that can be unstitched if a mistake is made. In Castleford the women whizz through detailed work such as cutting and stitching belt loops with absolute precision. The workers are all earning the independently verified living wage of \u00a38.25 an hour and get bonuses of up to 40p an hour on top if they meet production and quality targets. It takes four hours of intensive work to put together a trenchcoat \u2013 nearly twice as long as it takes to make a suit. But that\u2019s just the time spent stitching. Each trenchcoat comprises 80 pieces put together with about 120 processes. The coat\u2019s collar alone is made up of eight pieces and its complex design includes traditional \u201cD-rings\u201d, initially designed to hold hand grenades. Then there is the \u201cpork chop\u201d, as it is known in the factory, which can be buttoned across the throat to keep out the chill. The way the sewing is organised can make a dramatic difference. A decade ago it would take Burberry up to 15 weeks to process one garment, but detailed adjustments to working practiceshave knocked that down to six-and-a-half hours on a trial \u201clean\u201d production line. Workers are also taking on new projects. After several years of making only the brand\u2019s range of heritage trenchcoats, Castleford is now starting to make duffel coats and potentially other styles from Burberry\u2019s fashion ranges. They are also doing special work such as adding monogrammed embroidery and refurbishing vintage coats. Production involves the latest technology, such as a cutting machine that can adjust its path to ensure that the famous Burberry check is not skewed. But there are also homemade gadgets worthy of Heath Robinson, such as a miniature piston to turn belts and epaulettes right side out after sewing. Some of the machinery at the Cross Hills textile mill looks as though it has been around long enough to have been operated by Thomas Burberry when he set up the company in 1856. The squat building, which dates from the 1880s, houses 45 looms which can each pump out up to eight metres an hour of the tightly woven gaberdine, with just a handful of workers checking the cloth quality. A dizzying array of cotton spools from sparkling pink, gold, deep blood-red and pale pink is inched into tasteful tones by the clanking looms. Each piece of gaberdine, except black, is woven from two colours. The classic honey beige is a mix of pale cream and a surprising green gold that gives the fabric its glow. On a sunny morning in May, enough Burberry check to clothe the entire Beckham brood for a decade is spooling on to vast rollers. The mill works 24 hours a day with 75 people over three shifts producing 1.8m metres of fabric a year \u2013 all inspected by hand, with tiny glitches either remedied or marked to be cut around. While the basics of weaving have barely altered in decades, processes are increasingly being mechanised. It once took several days to thread up the complex workings of a loom \u2013 passing more than 10,000 thread ends through three parts of the machine using metal hooks and slivers of ivory made from piano keys. Now it takes just a few hours using a machine. Moving this heavy machinery while keeping production flowing will be as much of a challenge as holding on to the staff. But managers say Burberry desperately needs to make a move in order to expand its operations and update facilities \u2013 with better lighting, air conditioning and the latest energy saving technology. Burberry\u2019s designer clothing is not being made in a designer location. The floor in Castleford is a hotchpotch of patched wood and concrete. \u201cLook at this floor, it\u2019s like a ski slope,\u201d says one member of the Castleford team as he shows me around. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested lots of money in this building but we really need more space and a modern factory.\u201d",

They stitch 5,000 of the brand\u2019s heritage trenchcoats a week, each garment selling for more than \u00a31,100.</p> <p>The process has been so protected that this is the first time a British journalist has been allowed in to the coat factory in Castleford or Burberry\u2019s textile mill in Cross Hills, a village near Keighley. Even now, no cameras are allowed and the company wants to scrutinise any quotes from staff.</p> <p>It\u2019s no real surprise that Burberry has not been keen to shine a light on its humble UK factories. Between 2007 and 2009, more than 500 British jobs were lost as the designer label cut costs by closing production facilities in Treorchy, Wales, and Rotherham, and trimmed jobs in its Yorkshire factories.</p> <p>But now, under the leadership of Yorkshireman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/16/christopher-bailey-angela-ahrendts-burberry-ceo\">Christopher Bailey, Burberry\u2019s chief creative officer, who also became chief executive in 2014</a>, the company is investing at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/03/burberry-invest-50m-new-trenchcoat-factory-leeds\">\u00a350m in a new factory that could bring 200 more manufacturing jobs to the UK</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e4683da5a4bd45a4f6e637f6c144da196d61c2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e4683da5a4bd45a4f6e637f6c144da196d61c2a/0_47_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Freshly produced Burberry fabric is cut.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freshly produced Burberry fabric is cut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Burberry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Labelled Project Artisan, the new facility on the South Bank in Leeds will be the biggest newbuild clothing factory in the UK for at least 50 years \u2013 a statement about the brand\u2019s heritage and values.</p> <p>The focus on British manufacturing is part of Bailey\u2019s fightback plan, expected to be detailed next week when the company reveals its annual financial results. Bailey is under pressure because Burberry\u2019s sales have slowed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/fewer-wealthy-chinese-tourists-hits-burberry-sales-europe\">luxury-loving Chinese buyers have been put off travelling to Europe</a> by the terrorist attacks in Paris and kept out of Hong Kong, once a shoppers\u2019 paradise, by changes to visa rules. </p> <p>Bailey says: \u201cI\u2019m a great believer in British manufacturing and the crafts and skills we have here. We have 800 incredible craftsmen and women in our two factories in Yorkshire and their tradition is something we should all be proud of, continue to build on, and promote on a world stage.</p> <p>\u201cIn a world that\u2019s changing so dramatically, where everything is getting faster and faster, timeless skills, detailed and quality workmanship becomes more and more important and I am proud we can play a role in promoting that.\u201d</p> <p>Bailey is riding a wave of increasing interest in making textiles and clothing in the UK. Last year the sector saw the first increase in employment for more than 35 years, according to the Office for National Statistics. </p> <p>Plans for Burberry\u2019s new factory, designed by Stirling prize-winning architects Stanton Williams, are still on the drawing board but it is expected to open in late 2018 or 2019. It will combine weaving and coat manufacturing under one roof.</p> <p>Persuading the ladies, and select group of gents, who work in Castleford and Keighley, to travel to nearby Leeds will be an important part of the move. The longest serving employees have worked at Burberry for more than 40 years and many will have to switch from a quick walk to work to a long bus journey.</p> <p>Each member of the team is valuable as it takes a year of practice before sewers can take on the trickiest jobs such as stitching a collar. Trainees start with simple items such as wool capes \u2013 items that can be unstitched if a mistake is made.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/22/burberry-ready-modernise-fashion-without-delay\">Burberry ready to modernise fashion without delay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Castleford the women whizz through detailed work such as cutting and stitching belt loops with absolute precision. </p> <p>The workers are all earning the independently verified living wage of \u00a38.25 an hour and get bonuses of up to 40p an hour on top if they meet production and quality targets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92cf2ae0f5375709c31d2c42aebae9985c5409bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92cf2ae0f5375709c31d2c42aebae9985c5409bc/0_179_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burberry fabric in production.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The classic honey beige in the fabric is a mix of pale cream and a green gold that gives the fabric its glow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Burberry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It takes four hours of intensive work to put together a trenchcoat \u2013 nearly twice as long as it takes to make a suit. But that\u2019s just the time spent stitching.</p> <p>Each trenchcoat comprises 80 pieces put together with about 120 processes. The coat\u2019s collar alone is made up of eight pieces and its complex design includes traditional \u201cD-rings\u201d, initially designed to hold hand grenades. Then there is the \u201cpork chop\u201d, as it is known in the factory, which can be buttoned across the throat to keep out the chill.</p> <p>The way the sewing is organised can make a dramatic difference. A decade ago it would take Burberry up to 15 weeks to process one garment, but detailed adjustments to working practiceshave knocked that down to six-and-a-half hours on a trial \u201clean\u201d production line. </p> <p>Workers are also taking on new projects. After several years of making only the brand\u2019s range of heritage trenchcoats, Castleford is now starting to make duffel coats and potentially other styles from Burberry\u2019s fashion ranges. They are also doing special work such as adding monogrammed embroidery and refurbishing vintage coats.</p> <p>Production involves the latest technology, such as a cutting machine that can adjust its path to ensure that the famous Burberry check is not skewed. But there are also homemade gadgets worthy of Heath Robinson, such as a miniature piston to turn belts and epaulettes right side out after sewing.</p> <p>Some of the machinery at the Cross Hills textile mill looks as though it has been around long enough to have been operated by Thomas Burberry when he set up the company in 1856.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"834af7489c00f194648f584373eba931f5ac6f61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/834af7489c00f194648f584373eba931f5ac6f61/0_75_2480_3100/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Burberry textile mill in Keighley.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Burberry textile mill in Keighley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Burberry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The squat building, which dates from the 1880s, houses 45 looms which can each pump out up to eight metres an hour of the tightly woven gaberdine, with just a handful of workers checking the cloth quality.

      "bodyText": "National Grid has edged higher in a falling market after a broker upgraded its share price target. Analyst Andrew Fisher at Berenberg Bank has lifted his target from 850p to 970p but kept his hold rating on the basis that the price looks up with events. National Grid is up 0.5p at \u00a310.03. He said: If ever there has been a stock to tuck away in the portfolio and hold for the long term, National Grid is it. The group\u2019s long-and short- term share price performance has been outstanding: up 278% since flotation in 1995 (up 122% versus the FTSE 100 and up 83% versus the SX6P [European utilities index]; a 13% per annum average total shareholder return); up 12% in the last 12 months (up 26% versus the FTSE 100 and up 17% versus the SX6p). We are continuously kicking ourselves for not embracing the seemingly limited valuation upside in the shares in light of the group\u2019s dependable earnings stream and an attractive dividend policy (dividend per share growth is at least in line with RPI for the foreseeable future). Yet, again, we face a similar conundrum. National Grid is a fundamentally sound business and it has few well-flagged catalysts that incrementally add to the business\u2019s attractions (eg a Gas Distribution sale and special dividend, improvements in the US). However, the share price looks up with events, and the support of low interest rates cannot be counted on forever. We believe it is also carrying a Brexit premium (ie a positive currency translation of US business). Consequently, we increase our target price to 970p but stick with our hold recommendation. Elsewhere broadcaster ITV has lost 7.4p to 202.6p in the wake of Thursday\u2019s update where it lowered its forecast for first half advertising revenues. It said advertisers were holding back ahead of June\u2019s EU referendum. The news has prompted a number of analysts to cut their price targets. In a sell note Deutsche Bank moved from 200p to 185p and said: The ad outlook from the ITV first quarter interim management statement is even worse than expected. Consensus should be cutting 2016, but also needs to start thinking further out. This is not a temporary Brexit blip. On a day when Facebook is reported to be set to overtake C4 in ad revenues in the UK, and we estimate has already overtaken ITV in online video... 3% consensus ad growth from 2017 needs to be cut too. There is reinvestment risk too as ITV needs to respond in programming and digital acquisitions. The stock is cheap versus history, but the world has changed. Barclays cut its price target from 245p to 225p, while UBS moved from 230p to 195p. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is currently down 34.05 points at 6070.14, on track for its fourth consecutive weekly fall, the first time this has happened since June last year.",

      "body": "<p><strong>National Grid</strong> has edged higher in a falling market after a broker upgraded its share price target.</p> <p>Analyst Andrew Fisher at Berenberg Bank has lifted his target from 850p to 970p but kept his hold rating on the basis that the price looks up with events. National Grid is up 0.5p at \u00a310.03. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If ever there has been a stock to tuck away in the portfolio and hold for the long term, National Grid is it. The group\u2019s long-and short- term share price performance has been outstanding: up 278% since flotation in 1995 (up 122% versus the FTSE 100 and up 83% versus the SX6P [European utilities index]; a 13% per annum average total shareholder return); up 12% in the last 12 months (up 26% versus the FTSE 100 and up 17% versus the SX6p).</p> <p>We are continuously kicking ourselves for not embracing the seemingly limited valuation upside in the shares in light of the group\u2019s dependable earnings stream and an attractive dividend policy (dividend per share growth is at least in line with RPI for the foreseeable future).</p> <p>Yet, again, we face a similar conundrum. National Grid is a fundamentally sound business and it has few well-flagged catalysts that incrementally add to the business\u2019s attractions (eg a Gas Distribution sale and special dividend, improvements in the US). However, the share price looks up with events, and the support of low interest rates cannot be counted on forever. We believe it is also carrying a Brexit premium (ie a positive currency translation of US business). Consequently, we increase our target price to 970p but stick with our hold recommendation. </p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere broadcaster<strong> ITV</strong> has lost 7.4p to 202.6p in the wake of <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/12/itv-revenues-brexit-itv-studios\">Thursday\u2019s update where it lowered its forecast for first half advertising revenues</a></strong>. It said advertisers were holding back ahead of June\u2019s EU referendum. The news has prompted a number of analysts to cut their price targets.</p> <p>In a sell note Deutsche Bank moved from 200p to 185p and said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The ad outlook from the ITV first quarter interim management statement is even worse than expected. Consensus should be cutting 2016, but also needs to start thinking further out. This is not a temporary Brexit blip. On a day when Facebook is reported to be set to overtake C4 in ad revenues in the UK, and we estimate has already overtaken ITV in online video... 3% consensus ad growth from 2017 needs to be cut too. There is reinvestment risk too as ITV needs to respond in programming and digital acquisitions. The stock is cheap versus history, but the world has changed.</p> </blockquote> <p>Barclays cut its price target from 245p to 225p, while UBS moved from 230p to 195p.</p> <p>Meanwhile the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is currently down 34.05 points at 6070.14, on track for its fourth consecutive weekly fall, the first time this has happened since June last year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s construction sector suffered a sharp slowdown in the opening months of this year, adding to signs the economy is losing momentum as uncertainty around the EU referendum and the global outlook increases. The Office for National Statistics said construction output \u2013 which accounts for about 6% of the economy \u2013 fell 3.6% on the month in March. It was the biggest drop for more than four years. That extended falls in the previous two months and meant that for the first quarter of 2016 as a whole output was down 1.1% on the previous three months. It was down 1.9% on the year. Housebuilding continued to expand in the first quarter but infrastructure work fell, chiming with reports that some projects have been put on hold as nervous investors await the outcome of June\u2019s referendum on EU membership. The Bank of England has warned uncertainty around the vote would depress growth in the second quarter and that a decision to leave the EU could tip the UK into recession. \u201cThe latest construction figures provide yet more evidence that uncertainty about the outcome of the EU referendum is slowing the economic recovery,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. But the 23 June vote is not the only factor weighing on construction, Tombs added, and pointed to government spending cuts. \u201cThe construction sector \u2026 would be slowing even if the referendum was not taking place, due to the intensifying fiscal squeeze,\u201d he said. The March performance for construction was worse than economists had been expecting. The consensus forecast in a Reuters poll had been for a smaller monthly fall of 2.5%. The decline for the quarter was also worse than the 0.9% drop the ONS itself had estimated when publishing GDP figures for the first quarter. But statisticians said the downward revision had barely any impact on its estimate that GDP rose 0.4%. A breakdown of the first quarter figures showed new housing work rose 4.8% on the previous quarter. But infrastructure fell for the third consecutive quarter, decreasing by 5.6%. The sector the ONS calls \u201cother new work\u201d fell 2.4%. The construction sector is still struggling to shake off the scars of its deep recession and has yet to return to its pre-downturn peak from 2008. The latest figures will add to worries about the unbalanced nature of the UK economy after similarly gloomy data from the industrial sector this week, which showed it was back in recession. The only sector back above pre-downturn levels is services, which covers a range of activities from banking to retail and is the biggest part of the UK economy. But recent business surveys have pointed to a slowdown in services as well, suggesting economic growth is slowing.",

Coca-Cola HBC, one of the drinks group\u2019s bottlers, is among the biggest losers, down 55p at \u00a313.42 following news that first quarter revenues had fallen by 2.7%. The company was hit by weak emerging market currencies and the strength of the euro. Analyst Phil Carroll at Shore Capital said: Overall, a slight miss from a forecasts perspective but the underlying performance was slightly stronger than the figures suggest due to one less trading day. We continue to see forecast risk as we move towards the seasonally more important summer trading months from both foreign exchange especially in relation to Nigeria and the beneficial trading conditions from the warmer summer weather in a number of European markets last year. Therefore, on a 2016 forecast valuation of 19.1 times and an enterprise value/EBITDA ratio of 9.0 times, we retain our sell recommendation. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 35.14 points to 6069.05, with Brent crude dipping 0.85% to $47.67 as the dollar strengthened following comments from US Federal Reserve members suggesting a June rate rise was still possible. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: A weak finish on Wall Street combined with a disappointing Asian session has once again set the pace for London equities as Friday\u2019s trade gets underway. A break below the 6,000 level is certainly something that cannot be overlooked and that would be the first time in almost three months that we\u2019ve been down here. Looking ahead, US advance retail sales figures will be under close scrutiny later in the session as investors desperately need something to cheer. Yesterday\u2019s surprise jump in weekly jobless claims across the Atlantic added more misery into markets globally so it could be that even mild disappointment here is all it will take to lead London\u2019s blue chip territory to within a whisker of the 6,000 mark. Inmarsat, which has been under pressure since the satellite communications group cut its full year revenue guidance last week, is down 43.5p to 750.5p.

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Tesco, Dave Lewis, was paid \u00a34.6m including a \u00a33m bonus last year, when he stabilised the crisis-hit retailer and returned it to profit. The UK\u2019s largest supermarket group has experienced an upturn in sales amid the ongoing price war but the outlook for profits remains gloomy. Tesco made a pretax profit of \u00a3162m in the year to 27 February, after slumping \u00a36.4bn into the red the year before \u2013 the biggest loss ever recorded on the UK high street. Lewis received a salary of \u00a31.3m, a short-term annual bonus of \u00a32.99m, benefits worth \u00a380,000 and a \u00a3313,000 contribution to his pension, the company\u2019s annual report showed (pdf). His total package of \u00a34.6m rose from \u00a34.1m the previous year, after he joined in September 2014 to take the reins from Philip Clarke who was sacked. His package that year was boosted by a \u00a33.2m \u201cgolden hello\u201d \u2013 to compensate for bonuses forfeited at his former employer, Unilever. The second-best-paid executive at Tesco was the finance chief, Alan Stewart, who was paid \u00a32.6m last year. He got a \u00a31.6m bonus on top of his \u00a3750,000 salary. He also joined in September 2014, from Marks &amp; Spencer. Earlier this year, Tesco announced a 3.1% increase in basic pay for staff \u2013 nearly 250,000 employees \u2013 but the new deal also included cuts to holiday and night-time bonuses. Despite the pay rise, Tesco\u2019s terms and conditions lag behind rivals Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl. Deanna Oppenheimer, who chairs Tesco\u2019s remuneration committee, explained the executive pay policy: \u201cStretching 2015-16 annual bonus targets were set last year in the context of significant uncertainty and volatility for both Tesco and the retail sector, at a time when nearly all key indicators in the business were on a steep, negative trend.\u201d When determining bonuses, the committee \u201cconsidered the wider performance of the group and agreed management has reversed the negative trajectory and were making strong progress in delivering the turnaround plan. In particular, the group has achieved increased volumes and positive like-for-like sales, reduced costs, increased cash flow, and completed significant disposals and business restructuring to strengthen the balance sheet.\u201d Oppenheimer said financial targets for sales and operating profit, representing 80% of the bonus, were met almost fully for both Lewis and Stewart. The annual bonus will pay out at 95.7% of the maximum with half due to be deferred into shares under Tesco policy. Both executives offered to defer more of their cash bonus into shares, to \u201cdemonstrate their commitment to the business at this early stage of the turnaround,\u201d she said, so 75% of the bonus has been deferred into shares. They are due to pay out in July 2018 or when the company resumes dividend payments. Lewis also holds just over 100,000 ordinary shares in the business, worth \u00a31.56m at the current share price of 155.45p, while Stewart owns nearly 51,000 shares, worth nearly \u00a3788,000.",
