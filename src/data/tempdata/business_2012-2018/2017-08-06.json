      "bodyText": "Britons are slashing spending on new clothes, cars and foreign holidays, according to new figures that underscore the effect on consumer confidence of rising living costs and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Spending fell for a third consecutive month in July, according to Visa\u2019s consumer spending index, which it said was the longest-running slump since February 2013. The 0.8% year-on-year decline in July was worse than June\u2019s 0.2% drop, but not as steep as the fall of 0.9% in May. \u201cConsumer spending fell for the third month in a row in July, the first time overall spending had fallen for three consecutive months since February 2013,\u201d said Kevin Jenkins, Visa\u2019s UK and Ireland managing director. \u201cThe figure provides further evidence that rising prices and stagnant wage growth are squeezing consumers\u2019 pockets.\u201d The spending tracker highlighted a grim period for clothing and household goods retailers, with the amount Britons spent on updating their wardrobes and homes dropping 5.2% and 4% respectively. There was also evidence that staycations are in vogue this summer, with a drop in flight bookings contributing to a 6.1% fall in spending on transport and communications. Last week the clothing giant Next said sales at its high street stores had fallen 7.4% over the past three months, and its chief executive, Simon Wolfson, described a \u201cvery difficult consumer environment for clothing\u201d. July was also said to be the worst month for fashion retailers in eight years by the accountancy firm BDO in its monthly high street sales tracker. Sales were down 3.5% despite summer sales being in full swing, according to the survey of retailers that between them have 10,000 stores. Figures from the UK car industry also showed new sales falling for the fourth month running as Brexit uncertainty weighed on demand. Sales fell 9.3% in July to 161,997 as consumers and businesses grew increasingly reluctant to commit to big spending decisions. Annabel Fiddes, an IHS Markit economist, said households were having to cope with rising living costs against a backdrop of slowing earnings growth, highlighting recent government data showing total real pay falling at the quickest pace for nearly three years. \u201cAlongside the renewed squeeze on household budgets, uncertainties linger over the direction of the economy and the outcome of the ongoing Brexit negotiations, which is weighing down consumer confidence,\u201d said Fiddes. \u201cAll this makes it seem unlikely that consumer spending will recover in the current challenging conditions, and adds to expectations that the Bank of England will not hike rates any time soon.\u201d Last month the chancellor, Philip Hammond, admitted that the country\u2019s slowing economic growth was down to the squeeze on the cost of living caused by more expensive imports. \u201cConsumers are being affected by the inflation that was created by the depreciation of the currency in the autumn of last year,\u201d he told one interviewer. \u201cThat will pass through the economy, but I absolutely recognise it\u2019s painful as it\u2019s passing through the economy.\u201d The economy grew by just 0.3% in the second quarter of 2017, which followed 0.2% expansion in the first three months of the year, according to the Office for National Statistics. Darren Morgan, the head of national accounts at the ONS, described the figures \u2013 which were below the long-term growth trend \u2013 as a \u201cnotable slowdown\u201d. It was not all doom and gloom. The Visa data pointed to an early surge in summer staycations boosting the domestic leisure industry, as the weakness of sterling made going abroad more expensive. Its analysis showed a 6% increase in spending in UK hotels, restaurants and bars. \u201cThe leisure sector is likely to have benefited from an early surge in summer staycations, as the weak pound made holidaying at home more attractive,\u201d said Jenkins. Last week, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said there were signs that the uncertain outcome of Brexit negotiations was affecting firms\u2019 plans to invest and to award pay rises. A survey of FTSE 350 company secretaries for the Financial Times by the governance body, Icsa, found rising concern about political risk \u2013 most likely because of uncertainty around Brexit negotiations.",

      "bodyText": "Liverpool and Manchester are to be the testbed for an ambitious \u00a3600m project aiming to solve the thorny problem of how the government cuts the carbon footprint of the gas that heats most of Britain\u2019s homes. Cadent, which runs the connections to half of the UK homes on gas, hopes to undertake a pioneering trial in the 2020s using hydrogen as a cleaner alternative to methane in pipelines across the region. Formerly known as National Grid Gas Distribution Limited, the company will focus on industrial users in sectors such as chemicals and oil refining, because using 100% hydrogen requires new boilers to be installed. But some of the hydrogen will also be blended with methane and piped to millions of homes in Liverpool and Manchester. Cadent believes mixing in hydrogen to account for about a fifth of supplies could be done without harming domestic boilers and cooking equipment, such as hobs. \u201cWe want to help demonstrate a pathway to the decarbonisation of heat that is not only lowest cost to UK plc but is minimally invasive to customers. Any government policy which requires customers making different choices is very difficult,\u201d said David Parkin, the engineering director at Cadent. Hydrogen had an advantage over alternatives such as local heat networks or heat pumps run off electricity, he argued, because many people had a \u201cstrong emotional attachment\u201d to gas. The existing gas network also meant there was a ready-made way to distribute it. But to fully switch to hydrogen, the 26m gas boilers in the UK would need to be swapped for hydrogen-compatible models. About 85% of homes are heated by gas. \u201cIt does require changes in people\u2019s homes and it is likely to be expensive, so we are looking at a number of alternative pathways,\u201d said Parkin. That is the reason for the Liverpool-Manchester scheme\u2019s initial focus on industrial users. The area was selected because it has a population of 5m and represents about 11% of Britain\u2019s industrial sector. As well as reducing the number of boilers that need to be converted, industrial heat demand is relatively steady compared with the fluctuating demand from homes, which would probably require the company to build hydrogen storage, an additional cost. The carbon savings will come from the way the hydrogen is produced. It will be made from natural gas using a method known as steam reforming, but Cadent\u2019s plan is to capture the carbon monoxide and small amount of carbon dioxide generated during the process. The captured carbon will be pumped using existing pipelines and stored in Hamilton gas field in the Irish sea, which is due to be decommissioned in the early 2020s \u2013 a cost that could be avoided if the facility is repurposed as a repository for carbon. Whether the project goes ahead depends on tests underway on a private gas network at Keele University to identify how much hydrogen can safely be mixed in with methane for heating. An investment decision in the early 2020s would mean construction starting in the middle of the next decade. As a regulated monopoly, Cadent\u2019s costs would ultimately be borne by energy bill payers, though the regulator Ofgem would have to approve the anticipated \u00a3600m capital cost. Other parts of the UK exploring hydrogen for heating include Leeds, where Northern Gas Networks has worked with the government on a feasibility report that concluded a national switchover was viable but would cost \u00a32bn for Leeds and billions more to implement across the UK. Jonathan Marshall, an energy analyst at the ECIU thinktank, said: \u201cThis [Cadent] project shows at last some progress towards decarbonising heat, which seems to be perennially avoided as an issue. We\u2019ve seen progress on [emissions from] electricity and transport \u2013 heat is the final piece of the puzzle.\u201d Addressing public perceptions and concerns would be key. \u201cThe gas network is massive, hundreds of thousands of kilometres of pipes, so you\u2019d have to do[a switchover from methane to hydrogen] gradually to make sure nothing goes wrong,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s is to cut more than 1,000 jobs at head office as part of a fresh efficiency drive designed to save \u00a3500m. The UK\u2019s second-largest supermarket chain has drafted in McKinsey, the management consultancy, to draw up a headcount reduction plan. All the big supermarket chains have announced job cuts in recent years as they seek to compete with the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl. In March, Sainsbury\u2019s said it was cutting 400 jobs in store while another 4,000 workers would face changes to their working hours as it looked to run its supermarkets more cheaply. The changes included scrapping the night shift in 140 supermarkets. Sainsbury\u2019s will reach the end of a three-year plan to save \u00a3500m in March 2018 but Mike Coupe, the chief executive, has said the company will then embark on a new programme designed to save the same amount again. Sainsbury\u2019s has 3,000 back-office staff spread across a number of sites including Holborn in central London and a human resources support centre in Manchester. It also has an IT team based in Walsgrave, Coventry and a banking division in Edinburgh. Sainsbury\u2019s will confirm the exact number of job losses next month, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Employees involved in human resources and staff training were being targeted, it added. \u201cWe do not comment on speculation and would always make any announcement around jobs to our colleagues first,\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s said. Under the leadership of Coupe, Sainsbury\u2019s has sought to broaden its appeal with last year\u2019s \u00a31.4bn purchase of Argos. The deal reduced Sainsbury\u2019s reliance on the highly competitive grocery market and also gave it access to Argos\u2019s fast delivery network. It is analysing the books of convenience chain Nisa before a mooted \u00a3130m deal. Sainsbury\u2019s is the preferred bidder for Nisa, which is owned by its shopkeeper members, but its period of exclusivity is thought to expire at the end of this week. Last week, Nisa was dealt a blow by McColl\u2019s, its biggest customer, which announced it was transferring contracts worth 40% of its sales to Morrisons.",

All the big supermarket chains have announced job cuts in recent years as they seek to compete with the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl. </p> <p>In March, Sainsbury\u2019s said it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/03/sainsburys-to-cut-400-jobs-in-shake-up-of-operations\">cutting 400 jobs in store</a> while another 4,000 workers would face changes to their working hours as it looked to run its supermarkets more cheaply. The changes included scrapping the night shift in 140 supermarkets. </p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s will reach the end of a three-year plan to save \u00a3500m in March 2018 but Mike Coupe, the chief executive, has said the company will then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/09/sainsburys-prices-first-half-sales-fall\">embark on a new programme</a> designed to save the same amount again.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s has 3,000 back-office staff spread across a number of sites including Holborn in central London and a human resources support centre in Manchester. It also has an IT team based in Walsgrave, Coventry and a banking division in Edinburgh. </p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s will confirm the exact number of job losses next month, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Employees involved in human resources and staff training were being targeted, it added.</p> <p>\u201cWe do not comment on speculation and would always make any announcement around jobs to our colleagues first,\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s said.</p> <p>Under the leadership of Coupe, Sainsbury\u2019s has sought to broaden its appeal with last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/01/home-retail-backs-sainsburys-argos-takeover-bid\">\u00a31.4bn purchase of Argos</a>. The deal reduced Sainsbury\u2019s reliance on the highly competitive grocery market and also gave it access to Argos\u2019s fast delivery network. It is analysing the <a href=\"tel:www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/17/sainsburys-poised-to-buy-nisa-in-response-to-tesco-swoop-on-booker\">books of convenience chain Nisa</a> before a mooted \u00a3130m deal. </p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s is the preferred bidder for Nisa, which is owned by its shopkeeper members, but its period of exclusivity is thought to expire at the end of this week. Last week, Nisa was dealt a blow by McColl\u2019s, its biggest customer, which announced it was transferring contracts worth 40% of its sales to Morrisons.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Head office staff at the Tesco-owned One Stop convenience chain are fighting for a better redundancy package after it emerged employees on Tesco contracts were being offered a more generous payoff. At the start of this summer Tesco embarked on a cost-cutting programme, during which more than 2,300 people will leave the retailer in the coming months. In June its chief executive, Dave Lewis, said 1,200 head office jobs were on the line and that its Cardiff call centre would also close early next year, with a loss of 1,100 jobs. The supermarket chain is also selling off assets to shore up its finances and the latest plans for disposals include a remaining stake in Lazada, the fast-growing south-east Asian online retailer, to China\u2019s Alibaba in a deal that could be worth up to \u00a3200m. The One Stop subsidiary has been run at an arm\u2019s length by Tesco since it was acquired for \u00a3530m in 2002. The biggest One Stop stores were converted into branches of Tesco Express, but the rest continued to be managed by staff based at its Birmingham head office so as to keep the no-frills chain\u2019s running costs to a minimum. But the latest wave of job cuts, which are part of a plan to slash \u00a31.5bn from Tesco\u2019s cost base, has seen the departure of several members of the One Stop senior management team including the franchise director, Andrew King, and the retail director, Mark Williams. Tracey Clements, the managing director of Tesco\u2019s convenience business, remains in overall charge as chief executive of One Stop. One source claimed the redundancy programme had not been handled well and that staff felt it was not a \u201clevel playing field\u201d. One Stop head office staff had been primed to expect statutory redundancy pay whereas those working directly for Tesco are entitled to an additional payment linked to length of service, potentially worth thousands of pounds. One Stop representatives are expected to meet with Tesco managers on Monday to discuss the redundancy terms, which are yet to be finalised. \u201cWe\u2019re making a series of changes to our service model across Tesco to further simplify our business, including in our One Stop business,\u201d said a Tesco spokesperson. \u201cWhile One Stop will continue to be run as a separate business, these changes will mean we are able to take further advantage of synergies and experience between the two businesses, simplify our operations and align our service models more closely.\u201d Insiders say it is difficult to argue that One Stop, which has 850 stores, is a standalone operation. The exodus from the One Stop management team means that from now on Tesco executives will have more direct involvement in how it is run than ever before. Lewis, who took the helm of Tesco after the 2014 accounting scandal, has led a radical restructuring of the UK\u2019s biggest retailer. He has sold a number of businesses, including its South Korean chain Homeplus for \u00a34bn, and pushed through a programme of large-scale domestic job losses. Predecessor Philip Clarke took a near 20% stake in Lazada in 2013 as part of a \u00a3124m investment in the startup. Last year Tesco sold nearly half its Lazada holding to Alibaba for $129m (\u00a390.6m) in a deal that valued the Singapore-based company at $1.5bn. It also gave Alibaba the option to buy the rest of Tesco\u2019s shares within 18 months \u201cat a fair market value\u201d. Tesco confirmed it was selling the stake but declined to comment on the price. \u201cWe have agreed to sell our remaining minority stake to Alibaba completing a process that began in April 2016,\u201d said a spokesman. In June when Alibaba upped its stake in Lazada to 85%, the Chinese tech group said Lazada was now worth $3.15bn. On that basis Tesco\u2019s 8.3% stake could be worth up to $260m (\u00a3200m). Lewis has also been cutting jobs. In his first year in charge he cut nearly 5,000 head office and UK store management jobs. The most recent annual report shows the company now has 342,770 full-time equivalent employees compared with 391,868 he inherited. The latest jobs cuts are focused on Tesco\u2019s headquarters in Welwyn Garden City and Hatfield, One Stop\u2019s Birmingham office as well as its technology and retail support centre in Bangalore, India.",

      "bodyText": "Trailfinders, Britain\u2019s largest independent travel agent, has blamed Brexit for wiping \u00a312m off its annual profit. Figures filed at Companies House show that the company\u2019s founder, Mike Gooley, nevertheless paid himself a \u00a33m dividend, up from \u00a32m the previous year. Pre-tax profit for the privately owned firm fell to \u00a314.1m for the year to March 2017 from \u00a322.5m. Notes in the accounts for the company, which has more than 1,000 staff in 32 travel centres, said: \u201cTrading profit was adversely affected by the sharp and overnight fall in the value of sterling immediately following the 23 June 2016 referendum. \u201cThis unusual event depressed this year\u2019s profit by some \u00a312m but it is expected to recover in 2017/18\u201d. The weak pound makes it more expensive for Britons to take holidays abroad and also hits companies which have to use the pound to buy services and goods in dollars and euros. Sales increased to \u00a3728m from \u00a3682m over the period. The highest-paid director received \u00a3386,818, down from \u00a3392,529.

      "bodyText": "Something funny is going on in Britain\u2019s jobs market. And it\u2019s not a joke. Unemployment has dropped to 4.5%, the lowest since 1975. The employment rate is the highest on record at 74.9%. On paper, it\u2019s the tightest labour market in almost half a century, and yet workers are no better off. In fact, they are worse off after adjusting for inflation. The problem is that, while employers bemoan skills shortages and have a near-record number of vacancies to fill, average wages are barely growing. Inflation, meanwhile, has picked up as the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote raises the cost of imports. On the latest figures, for the three months to May, pay adjusted to account for inflation fell by 0.5% year-on-year. Taking a longer view, pay has yet to recover to its pre-crisis peak in inflation-adjusted, or real, terms. Compared with the spring of 2008, employees are earning \u00a315 less a week before tax and other deductions from pay, according to the Office for National Statistics. The Bank of England says the squeeze on living standards will continue for the rest of this year. It expects inflation to peak around 3% in the autumn. Wage growth is expected to average 2% in 2017. The Bank does not see much improvement next year. But it has often been wrong about wage growth, typically making overoptimistic forecasts. So what is going on? Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, had a chance to give his take last week as he unveiled Threadneedle Street\u2019s outlook for the economy. Carney said the UK\u2019s lacklustre productivity growth bore much of the blame. There were also signs that companies were reticent to increase pay amid Brexit uncertainties. As the governor spoke, striking Bank staff protested outside over a below-inflation pay offer. His comments exposed a split on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee. Carney and the deputy governor Ben Broadbent both rebuffed the idea that wages have failed to clamber back to their pre-crisis level in part because the nature of work has changed. By contrast, Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, has highlighted several trends that suggest anaemic wage growth is at least partly driven by the balance of power shifting towards employers. Haldane used a recent speech to argue the clock had been turned back to the days before the Industrial Revolution when there were no trade unions and self-employment was rife. He is right. Workers\u2019 influence over their hours, conditions and pay has been eroded as a culture of insecurity takes hold. Consider the following four factors. First is the rise of short-hours contracts and of zero-hours contracts, whereby employees are not guaranteed a minimum number of hours in any given week. The number of people on zero-hours contracts in their main job rose from 168,000, or 0.6% of those in employment, in 2010 to a record 905,000, or 2.8% of those in employment, at the end of 2016. Of course, some of that rise may be the result of greater awareness of such contracts and people accurately reporting their circumstances to statisticians. In the latest figures, there was a drop in the number of companies using such contracts. But as the TUC points out, some of that is down to bad publicity around zero-hours arrangements and companies are finding other ways to employ people on insecure terms. It cites evidence that businesses are employing staff on short-hours contracts, guaranteeing as little as one hour a week. What these contracts mean in practice is people are turning up to work at shops, care homes and warehouses and, if their employer so chooses, they are being sent home before their shift has even begun. A second factor is higher self-employment, up from less than 8% of the workforce in 1980 to almost 15% in 2016, as Haldane noted. Some people are happily setting up their own business, enjoying being their own boss. But some is what MPs investigating the gig economy have described as \u201cbogus self-employment\u201d. People were being forced into self-employment as couriers, taxi drivers and other roles, as companies declined to take them on as employees, said parliament\u2019s work and pensions committee. Some were on contracts paying less than \u00a32.50 an hour, said the committee\u2019s former chair Frank Field. Those self-employed earnings are not in the ONS official wages data, but this reliance on lower-paid contractors naturally depresses nationwide earnings growth. A third factor is underemployment, or part-time workers who say they would like more hours. This has declined over the past three years, but is still higher than a decade ago: 12.1% of part-timers, compared with 9.4% in 2007. There is also evidence that more people are stuck in work for which they are overqualified and so are unlikely to be earning to their full potential . The Institute for Public Policy Research reckons 5.1 million people are \u201cover-educated\u201d for their role compared with 3.9 million in 2006. Finally, there is the dimming of workers\u2019 voices. Union membership has fallen dramatically and the idea of driving it back up in an increasingly fragmented workforce is challenging. Theresa May once pledged to give workers a stronger say by putting them on boards but has since watered down her proposals. Put all that together and weak wage growth is not so puzzling after all. Nor is it so surprising that work is no longer as sure a route out of poverty as it once was. In 1996-97, there were 2.3m working households in poverty, today there are 3.7m, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. To gauge how far we truly are from full employment, JRF has combined various labour market measures. Its \u201cmore jobs gap\u201d captures the proportion of the workforce not in work, including those classed as economically inactive, but who would like to work and those who are underemployed. The total is 5.4 million people, or 18% of the labour force (taking a broader view than official statistics by also including those who are inactive but who would like to work). No wonder the old relationship between pay and headline unemployment is dead. The Bank of England can keep being overoptimistic on pay and the government can keep saying that work is the best way out of poverty, but they will both be proved wrong if the balance of power continues to slide further towards employers.",

      "bodyText": "Once the butt of jokes among connoisseurs, producers of English wine have worked hard to build respect for the products of their vineyards. But even though they are going through a boom time at the moment \u2013 the number of wine businesses in England and Wales has blossomed in the last year \u2013 their toughest challenge may be ahead of them this week. The Great British Beer Festival starts at Olympia in London on Tuesday and will feature a selection of English wines for the first time. Drinkers will be encouraged to swap their pints of Black Sheep\u2019s Holy Grail, Huell Melon and Cornish Knocker for a glass of Exton Park, from a new vineyard in Hampshire, or Chapel Down. The English and Welsh wine industry is one of the fastest-growing agricultural sectors in the UK \u2013 the number of acres planted with vines has grown by 135% in a decade. The rise in popularity has been put down to demand from abroad, the weak pound and the creeping recognition that English wine is not to be sneered at following more investment in the sector. But what will the attendees of the Great British Beer Festival say? Organiser Ian Hill thinks the 40th anniversary of the festival is a good time to open it up to new tastes. Time will tell whether the drinkers agree. Best in show Is Pets at Home still in the doghouse? The retailer has had a tumultuous time of late and investors will no doubt be listening closely on Tuesday when its management gives a trading update for the first quarter of the year. The share price dropped in May when Morgan Stanley warned that specialist retail chains such as Pets at Home, which has more than 400 superstore outlets, were not sustainable in the age of the internet and discount stores. Later in the month however, the company showed that its move into veterinary and grooming services had proved lucrative, with a 45% rise in revenues in that portion of the business for the year to the end of March. At the same time, however, sales of merchandise were down as space was reallocated in stores. The company also said that it needed to provide better prices to customers. The financial service company Hargreaves Lansdown said investors would \u201cbe keen to see if the new pricing strategy is driving sales up after recent weakness\u201d. Boss Hogg\u2019s downfall The Bank of England will publish a report this week prompted by one of the more embarrassing incidents in its recent history. In March this year, Charlotte Hogg resigned as deputy governor of the Bank of England after MPs concluded that she was not up to the role she was promoted into barely two weeks previously. The Treasury select committee published a highly critical report into her failure to disclose that her brother worked for Barclays, which is regulated by the Bank of England. A scion of one of Britain\u2019s best-known political families, Hogg had initially told MPs that the Bank was aware of Quintin Hogg\u2019s role at the high street lender. She then admitted days later that she had not made the disclosure and was therefore in breach of the Bank\u2019s code of conduct \u2013 which she had helped to write. She had joined the Bank as chief operating officer in 2013 and moved to the number two job on 1 March. At the time, the court of directors of the Bank said it accepted her resignation with \u201cdeep regret\u201d and paid tribute to her contributions. A review was commissioned to learn the lessons of Hogg\u2019s case; whether internal changes made following her resignation were enough and what the Bank should do to ensure compliance with the code of conduct, especially among senior members. The report will be published on Wednesday morning.",

      "body": "<p>Once the butt of jokes among connoisseurs, producers of English wine have worked hard to build respect for the products of their vineyards. But even though they are going through a boom time at the moment \u2013 the number of wine businesses in England and Wales has blossomed in the last year \u2013 their toughest challenge may be ahead of them this week.</p> <p>The Great British Beer Festival starts at Olympia in London on Tuesday and will feature a selection of English wines for the first time. Drinkers will be encouraged to swap their pints of Black Sheep\u2019s Holy Grail, Huell Melon and Cornish Knocker for a glass of Exton Park, from a new vineyard in Hampshire, or Chapel Down.</p> <p>The English and Welsh wine industry is one of the fastest-growing agricultural sectors in the UK \u2013 the number of acres planted with vines has grown by 135% in a decade. The rise in popularity has been put down to demand from abroad, the weak pound and the creeping recognition that English wine is not to be sneered at following more investment in the&#xa0;sector.</p> <p>But what will the attendees of the Great British Beer Festival say? Organiser Ian Hill thinks the 40th anniversary of the festival is a good time to open it up to new tastes. Time will tell whether the drinkers agree.</p> <h2>Best in show</h2> <p>Is Pets at Home still in the doghouse? The retailer has had a tumultuous time of late and investors will no doubt be listening closely on Tuesday when its management gives a trading update for the first quarter of the year.</p> <p>The share price dropped in May when Morgan Stanley warned that specialist retail chains such as Pets at Home, which has more than 400 superstore outlets, were not sustainable in the age of the internet and discount stores. Later in the month however, the company showed that its move into veterinary and grooming services had proved lucrative, with a 45% rise in revenues in that portion of the business for the year to the end of March. At the same time, however, sales of merchandise were down as space was reallocated in stores. The company also said that it needed to provide better prices to customers. The financial service company Hargreaves Lansdown said investors would \u201cbe keen to see if the new pricing strategy is driving sales up after recent weakness\u201d.</p> <h2>Boss Hogg\u2019s downfall</h2> <p>The Bank of England will publish a report this week prompted by one of the more embarrassing incidents in its recent history. In March this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/14/mps-question-charlotte-hoggs-suitability-for-bank-of-england-role\" title=\"\">Charlotte Hogg resigned</a> as deputy governor of the Bank of England after MPs concluded that she was not up to the role she was promoted into barely two weeks previously.</p> <p>The Treasury select committee published a highly critical report into her failure to disclose that her brother worked for Barclays, which is regulated by the Bank of England.</p> <p>A scion of one of Britain\u2019s best-known political families, Hogg had initially told MPs that the Bank was aware of Quintin Hogg\u2019s role at the high street lender. She then admitted days later that she had not made the disclosure and was therefore in breach of the Bank\u2019s code of conduct \u2013 which she had helped to write.</p> <p>She had joined the Bank as chief operating officer in 2013 and moved to the number two job on 1 March. At the time, the court of directors of the Bank said it accepted her resignation with \u201cdeep regret\u201d and paid tribute to her contributions.</p> <p>A review was commissioned to learn the lessons of Hogg\u2019s case; whether internal changes made following her resignation were enough and what the Bank should do to ensure compliance with the code of conduct, especially among senior members. The report will be published on Wednesday morning.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ten years ago this week, the global financial crisis started with a small rumble in France. Local bank BNP Paribas announced it was freezing the assets of three hedge funds with heavy exposures to the US sub-prime mortgage market. A little more than a year later, after the run on Northern Rock and the bailout of Bear Stearns in the US, the full earthquake arrived in the form of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks. We soon discovered the full horrors within the financial system. Banks had taken on risks they did not understand and called the process \u201cinnovation\u201d. Credit rating agencies had fallen asleep. Weak or incompetent regulators, encouraged by politicians, had been idle. In the UK, RBS would be mostly nationalised and the ailing HBOS was shoved into the arms of Lloyds TSB with a state bailout to follow. A decade after the start of the drama is a good moment to ask whether the financial system, and the world, is truly safer. There is good news \u2013 but also worrying signs of trouble ahead. The encouraging part is that the world of banking has been transformed from the under-capitalised, over-leveraged and inadequately supervised system of 2007. In June this year, Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, was able to report that losses that would have wiped out the entire capital base of the UK banking system in 2006 could now be fully absorbed by the top-up capital buffers alone. But, in the new spirit of caution, he still demanded more to cope with rising credit risks. Regulators are now obliged to use their judgment, rather than rely on rigid models, in forming their views on individual banks\u2019 capital needs. They have tried to instil a culture of personal accountability at the top of financial firms. There is greater international cooperation since the formation of the Financial Stability Board in 2009. Transparency has improved, too. More financial trades have to be cleared through central counterparties, which in theory means the toxic creations of yesteryear \u2013 collateralised debt obligations, and so on \u2013 could not balloon in size unnoticed. This new system has yet to be tested under fire, of course. Would regulators really trust their own \u201cresolution\u201d regimes if another big bank was in peril, or would they again resort to state funds? It\u2019s impossible to know until the crisis arrives, but the positions of taxpayers look massively improved from 2007-09. That is the good news. The bad news is that, when one takes a step back, some of the deeper causes of the crisis look as entrenched as ever. In their first response to a debt-fuelled crisis, regulators pursued what Lord King, Carney\u2019s predecessor, called the \u201cparadox of policy\u201d \u2013 they slashed interest rates to encourage spending and to prevent recession turning to depression. But the medicine was supposed to be only for short-term emergency use. Almost a decade later, UK interest rates are 0.25%, and the US has reached only 1%-1.25%, but the debt has not been sweated off. In the UK the household savings rate has collapsed. The amount being set aside as savings has now slipped to just 1.7% of disposable income, the lowest level on record. That may explain why Carney\u2019s colleagues are shouting warnings about a potential \u201cspiral of complacency\u201d in lending. Easy credit has become the norm, but growth is too weak to risk a quick return to \u201cnormal\u201d monetary conditions. Those ingredients are ripe for another credit bubble. Or perhaps the next crisis might arrive from elsewhere \u2013 such as China, now having to cope with its own enormous levels of internal debt. A China-inspired global downturn would be a fresh phenomenon for the world, but the west would be ill-equipped to pick up the slack. The central bankers\u2019 rate-cutting cupboard is bare. A decade on from the start of the crisis, fixing the banks looks the easier part of the job. How to replace debt with a better engine of growth remains the unsolved challenge. It is hard to be optimistic. Tweaking the listing rules \u2013 yes, even for Aramco \u2013 is unwise Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, thinks we should not be surprised if the listing rules in London \u201cfrom time to time are refreshed by the regulator to take into account the reality we live in\u201d. Put like that \u2013 and with scrupulous avoidance of any reference to Saudi Aramco \u2013 the process can be made to sound benign. A tweak here, an update there: isn\u2019t that what the grown-ups at the Financial Conduct Authority should be doing to maintain London\u2019s place at the top of the global financial pecking order? The problem, of course, is that the FCA\u2019s proposal to create a new category of \u201cpremium\u201d listing for state-controlled companies is not a minor revision. Such companies would be able to ignore two protections for shareholders that have been regarded as fundamental to the highest standards of governance. First, Aramco (because, let\u2019s face it: the FCA has only raised the subject because the Saudis intend to sell a small slice of their oil titan) would not have to seek outside shareholders\u2019 approval for deals between the company and the state. Second, Aramco would not be obliged to give outside shareholders a vote on who should represent their interests as independent directors. The FCA\u2019s thin justification is that companies controlled by a state are somehow different from those controlled by private individuals. Get real, the Institute of Directors said, more or less, in its excellent submission to the regulator last week. \u201cThe need for ... checks and balances on controlling shareholder power are as great, if not greater, in cases where the controlling shareholder is a nation,\u201d it said. A state has overwhelming power: as the IoD said, there is a fair argument that listing rules should be strengthened, not softened, for state-backed firms. Will the FCA back down? It should. Opposition from fund managers, and now the IoD, is strong. They can see what should be obvious: that lowering governance standards will damage London\u2019s reputation and be bad for business in the long run. So long, Irene, and thanks for all the broken promises \u201cWhere\u2019s Irene?\u201d was a familiar refrain during 2010, when Kraft\u2019s chief executive Irene Rosenfeld refused to turn up to a parliamentary committee investigation into the US company\u2019s takeover of Cadbury. Seven years on, it\u2019s more a case of good riddance, Irene, after her departure was announced from Mondel\u0113z \u2013 the business spun out of Kraft two years later to house Cadbury and brands such as Toblerone and Milka. Rosenfeld \u2013 who was paid nearly $22m the year after the takeover \u2013 made few friends in the UK. MPs on the business committee concluded the company had been close to contempt of the Commons by her refusal to attend. The Takeover Panel censored Kraft after it broke the promise it made during the five-month takeover battle to keep open Cadbury\u2019s Somerdale factory in Somerset. It did so only a week after its bid succeeded. In the UK at least, all her business achievements will be forever overshadowed by these events.",
