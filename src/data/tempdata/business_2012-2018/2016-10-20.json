      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturing recovery from the financial crash is built on an expansion of low-skilled jobs, according to a report that dents the sector\u2019s modern, hi-tech image. The findings show that since 2011, far from being the source of new jobs in research and development, the manufacturing sector has suffered a \u201cfresh era of decline\u201d as it relies on an expansion of assembly line roles in industries from drug making to food processing. Output has \u201cbarely risen\u201d in the past five years despite a 5% increase in the number of jobs created, the report found, revealing that the driving force of year-on-year productivity improvements have eluded the sector. The report by the Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute highlights the uphill task faced by the government as it seeks to develop an industrial strategy and rebalance the economy towards manufacturing exports. Some large manufacturers have expanded their research facilities in the UK, notably Dyson, the household appliance maker, which recently expanded its Wiltshire headquarters to house more than 450 extra engineers. But many have persevered with outdated factories and coped with higher output by employing more staff, which means output per hour remains flat. In the wake of the referendum vote, a string of car companies and other major firms have hinted that they could review their investments in the UK, adding to concerns that manufacturing faces extra barriers to trade at a time when the sector is already weak. Dr Craig Berry, the author of the report, said: \u201cThe growth in manufacturing jobs in the last five years, however limited, is to be welcomed. British manufacturing is not dead, but the sector is in great peril. \u201cThere are few signs of sustainable growth in advanced manufacturing industries, and we now seem to be witnessing a new phenomenon whereby the UK manufacturing sector is creating lower-skilled jobs without enhancing its productive capacity. This is a different kind of manufacturing decline than we have experienced in the past, but it is a decline nevertheless,\u201d he said. The UK\u2019s productivity rate, which measures output per hour, has only recently returned to its pre-crisis level. Official figures for 2015 show the UK\u2019s average performance across all industries was 27, 30 and 35 percentage points lower than in France, the US and Germany respectively. The number of jobs in manufacturing has slumped from 7m in 1971 to 3.8m in 2001 and little more than 2.7m this year. It means that fewer than 10% of the UK\u2019s almost 32 million-strong workforce works in the sector, though servicing jobs that rely on manufacturing are not included in the figures. It has long been assumed that the rapid expansion of low and semi-skilled jobs in the recovery since 2011 have been confined to service industries. However, the report shows that much of the expansion in manufacturing has also relied on workers filling jobs with . The report said that from the 1970s to the 1990s, manufacturers overhauled their factories to improve productivity, cutting thousands of jobs and increasing output. The pharmaceutical industry expanded production by 60% between 1991 and 2001. Computer makers enjoyed a 53% rise in output over the same period. This pattern began to shift in the 2000s, with job numbers tumbling by a third, and output declining by around 4%. Drug makers have been among the worst affected since 2011 following a 7.4% drop in output. Chemical production, which fell by almost 7% between 2001 and 2011, has barely recovered following a 1.8% expansion of output in the past five years. Output growth in cars and trucks has remained stable at a relatively high level since the 2000s, leaving the industry as almost the only major employer still to be investing and improving productivity. Berry said: \u201cTheresa May has promised a renewed focus on industrial policy, but it is not clear that her agenda will differ substantively to that of the previous government. What is required is an industrial strategy which ensures all economic policy functions are focused on supporting sustainable industrial development. Challenging the primacy of the Treasury in economic policy-making will be central to this endeavour.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Commons debate on Sir Philip Green\u2019s knighthood was entertaining \u2013 or as entertaining as a debate can be when all sides agree the fellow is a damned rascal who should not have been given a gong in the first place. Iain Wright, chair of the business select committee that co-authored the report on the demise of BHS, provided the most memorable line. \u201cHe took the rings from BHS\u2019s fingers, beat it black and blue, starved it of food and water, put it on life support and then wanted credit for keeping it alive.\u201d It could serve as a reverse citation if the honours forfeiture committee removes the knighthood, as it surely will unless Green very quickly presents a large cheque to cover the deficit in the BHS pension fund. Yet the two-hour debate also felt absurd for the reason hinted at above: is anyone surprised that Green turned out not to be a cuddly capitalist from the John Lewis school of shopkeeping? Green\u2019s robust approach had been documented for years before Tony Blair awarded him the knighthood in 2006. Recall the saga of this paper\u2019s analysis of Green\u2019s finances in 2003, soon after the BHS purchase; the tycoon\u2019s angry tirade was a classic of a genre he had made his own. Blair, presumably seeking to rekindle the Britpop buzz of his early years as PM, embraced Topshop, Kate Moss and the Green caravan. He didn\u2019t stop to consider the principle of honouring a man who paid the dividends to his Monaco-resident wife. The award was ludicrous. But, then, the whole game of awarding knighthoods to business people is riddled with mutual back-scratching and short-termism. Business empires fall, even banks collapse and supposed heroes can be revealed as having feet of clay. The time to judge a business leader\u2019s contribution is when his or her career is over \u2013 or even half a decade later. It is hard to summon the same fury as the MPs over Green\u2019s gong, as opposed to his shabby sale of BHS to an obviously unsuitable buyer. Removal would satisfy the simple sense that \u201ca billionaire spiv who has shamed British capitalism\u201d, as Labour\u2019s David Winnick put it, deserves to have his ego pricked. Yet two things will not change. Green will still have a moral obligation to repair the damage to BHS\u2019s pension fund, which is probably where MPs should concentrate their efforts. And the honours system, as it applies to mid-career business people, will still be daft. Nasser\u2019s replacement at BHP Billiton will need a deft touch Jac Nasser is departing BHP Billiton after six years as chairman and one of the big jobs in the Australian business world is up for grabs. The world\u2019s largest miner will have no difficulty in recruiting another heavyweight figure, but the role won\u2019t have quite the same allure as it did back in 2010. Back then, the living was easy for the entire mining industry. The commodity supercycle was in full swing, thanks to China\u2019s infrastructure splurge, and the debate in the boardrooms was about the pace of expansion \u2013 fast, or very fast. BHP, to its credit, had a keener sense than most of its rivals that the good times would not last for ever. Thus, when the inevitable bust in commodity prices arrived, it avoided the humiliation of a rights issue. Others didn\u2019t, thus Nasser can depart BHP while pointing to a superior record on total shareholder returns. But let\u2019s not pretend BHP was a model of self-discipline. The failure to buy PotashCorp of Saskatchewan in 2010 was a lucky escape. The entry into the US shale market the following year \u2013 just before oil prices collapsed \u2013 was timed horribly and big write-offs followed. The company was also too slow to cut its dividend after the Samarco dam disaster in Brazil in which 19 people died. Samarco will consume much of BHP\u2019s attention in coming years in the form of legal battles and compensation claims. As will the on-off spats with Australian politicians who, in more straitened times, want to protect their tax revenues. The next chair of BHP can afford to know little about mergers and acquisitions \u2013 deft political skills are at a premium. Ryanair: return flight check-in charge is not so nice So much for Michael O\u2019Leary\u2019s vow not to \u201cunnecessarily piss people off.\u201d Ryanair\u2019s chief executive has provoked the wrath of some of his customers by announcing plans to charge \u00a36 for customers wishing to check in more than four days before a flight. Current policy is to allow free check-in beginning seven days before a flight for unallocated seats, which is vaguely convenient if you\u2019re off for a week\u2019s holiday and fear being fleeced on roaming charges while abroad. Ryanair says the shift is designed to benefit those passengers who pay between \u00a38 and \u00a315 to reserve a particular seat in advance; they will have more time to pick their spot. This sounds like self-serving nonsense. easyJet allows free online check-in up to 30 days before a flights and still manages to operate a reservation system. Ryanair could do the same if it wished. Being nicer, it seems, is a flexible policy.",

Current policy is to allow free check-in beginning seven days before a flight for unallocated seats, which is vaguely convenient if you\u2019re off for a week\u2019s holiday and fear being fleeced on roaming charges while abroad.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ryanair\">Ryanair</a> says the shift is designed to benefit those passengers who pay between \u00a38 and \u00a315 to reserve a particular seat in advance; they will have more time to pick their spot. This sounds like self-serving nonsense. easyJet allows free online check-in up to 30 days before a flights and still manages to operate a reservation system. Ryanair could do the same if it wished. Being nicer, it seems, is a flexible policy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Top European central bankers have warned against politicians interfering in monetary policy, amid intense scrutiny of Mark Carney\u2019s interest-rate strategy following the Brexit vote. Andreas Dombret, who sits on the board of the German Bundesbank, told an audience of bankers in London that it was \u201ctime for a friendly reminder that central bank independence is not debatable\u201d. He was speaking just days after Carney, governor of the Bank of England, had said he was \u201cnot going to take instruction on our policies from the political side\u201d. The governor made his remarks after the prime minister, Theresa May, told Conservative party conference that \u201cordinary working-class people\u201d were being hurt by low interest rates as well as the electronic money printing exercise known as quantitative easing. Hours after Dombret delivered his wide-ranging speech to the British Bankers\u2019 Association, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, was asked about May\u2019s remarks as he announced the bank\u2019s latest monetary policy for the eurozone. Draghi said he did not feel central bank independence was threatened and rebutted May\u2019s criticism about the impact. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t feel threatened. Neither is the independence of monetary policy by the governing council threatened,\u201d said Draghi. The cause of inequality was not monetary policy but unemployment, he said. The former foreign secretary William Hague also waded into the debate about low interest rates, writing in the Daily Telegraph on Tuesday that savers were finding it \u201cimpossible to earn a worthwhile return\u201d. Lord Hague added: \u201cUnless [central banks] change course soon they will find their independence increasingly under attack.\u201d Dombret said politicians had removed themselves from monetary policy for \u201cvery good\u201d reasons. \u201cExperience shows that political influence over central banks always leads into disorder. At the end of the day, independent central banks best guarantee price stability. Calling central bank independence into question, even only implicitly, can confuse markets as well as the public about who is in charge when it comes to monetary policy and supervisory decisions. \u201cNevertheless, we have seen some criticism of central banks and their policies from politicians lately. This concerned, for example, the handling of Brexit, as well as conducting monetary policy and setting interest rates more generally.\u201d Dombret played down the impact of Brexit on the financial system. \u201cBrexit and its possible repercussions for the City of London are unlikely to be an issue for financial stability or the financing of the EU\u2019s real economy,\u201d he said. France\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Sylvie Bermann, told the conference that Paris was ready to welcome banking business, as Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers\u2019 Association, warned that banks were getting ready to move. \u201cTheir hands are poised quivering over the relocate button, with the first movements expected in the coming months,\u201d Browne said. May has said she intends to trigger article 50 \u2013 the formal mechanism that starts the two-year negotiating period to leave the EU \u2013 in March. However, the Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, a former attorney general, told bankers that this timetable was optimistic as a legal challenge to Brexit could make it necessary for parliament to debate the UK\u2019s exit terms.",

      "bodyText": "Nestl\u00e9 has hinted that it might follow Pot Noodle and Marmite-maker Unilever by seeking to raise the price of some of its products, such as KitKat and Milkybar, to offset the weakness of the pound. Speaking as the Swiss firm released disappointing sales figures on Thursday, chief executive Paul Bulcke said the firm\u2019s UK business would make its own decision on prices but admitted they could rise. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna have to sort it out and do that responsibly,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means seeing all possible other actions to absorb the [devaluation].\u201d But he added that price rises would be limited by the fact that most of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s biggest-selling products in the UK are also made there. \u201cI think KitKat is going to stay a very enjoyable great break, so I don\u2019t see that turning differently,\u201d he said. The merest hint of price rises is likely to cause jitters among supermarkets, coming just a week after a spat between Marmite-maker Unilever and Tesco. Several products briefly disappeared from Tesco\u2019s website, sparking fears of a nationwide Marmite shortage, after the retailer balked at Unilever\u2019s plans to raise prices by 10%. The two firms eventually reached an accord, although neither side disclosed whether this would mean an increase in the price of Unilever products. The Nestl\u00e9 boss\u2019s comments will encourage fears that some of its best-loved products, such as Nescaf\u00e9 and KitKat, are also destined to rise in price. Retail experts expect other companies to follow suit if sterling stays persistently low or falls even further against the dollar and euro. Veteran retail analyst Nick Bubb said supermarkets would have to get used to foreign food companies looking to offset reduced income from pounds spent by British shoppers. \u201cThese things are inevitable, given sterling weakness and the supermarkets can\u2019t expect suppliers to shoulder all the burden,\u201d said Bubb. The British Retail Consortium has warned that the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote is likely to push up prices, because much of the UK\u2019s food is imported from abroad. Tesco\u2019s UK boss, Matt Davies, said earlier this week that food price inflation could prove \u201clethal\u201d for millions of people on low incomes. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s warning of potential price rises came as the firm cut its forecast sales growth for the year after a slowdown. The world\u2019s largest food company, which has a stock market value of \u00a3190bn, now expects sales to rise by 3.5%, down from an earlier prediction of 4.2%, after sales in the first nine months rose 3.3% to \u00a358.5bn. \u201cThese figures reflect a global soft trading environment,\u201d said Bulcke. He said the company was happy to chase sales volume and market share, while resisting the urge to raise prices amid economic fragility around the world and the risk of deflation in areas such as Europe. But he said Nestl\u00e9 was taking steps to become \u201cleaner and more efficient\u201d. Europe, the Middle East and North Africa was Nestl\u00e9\u2019s weakest region, displaying nine-month sales growth of just 2.2%, while North America performed the best, up 4.5%.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "MPs have voted to strip Sir Philip Green of his knighthood in a symbolic move that adds to the pressure on the retail tycoon over the BHS scandal. The businessman\u2019s reputation was dealt a further blow following a debate in which he was labelled a \u201cbillionaire spiv\u201d who should never have received his honour in the first place. The approval of the parliamentary motion carries no official weight but it intensifies the pressure on Green, who has been criticised for foot-dragging in negotiations with the pensions regulator over the \u00a3571m hole in the BHS pension fund. Green was pilloried during a more than two hour-long debate in which the once feted entrepreneur, who was knighted for services to the retail sector, was lambasted by MPs from across the political spectrum for his family\u2019s role in the downfall of the high street chain. The fall of BHS triggered 11,000 job losses and left thousands of pensioners facing cuts to their benefits. \u201c[Green is a] billionaire spiv who should never have received a knighthood, a billionaire spiv who has shamed British capitalism,\u201d said Labour MP David Winnick during a debate that, without a single Green sympathiser in the room, turned into a character assassination. MPs labelled Green an \u201casset stripper\u201d and \u201ccorporate raider\u201d, who was likened in the chamber to Napoleon and the former Mirror Group owner Robert Maxwell. The Labour MP Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, whose role in the MPs\u2019 inquiry into the collapse of BHS has put him into the role of Green\u2019s nemesis, said the businessman appeared willing to lose his reputation rather than \u201csurrender a modest part of his mega-fortune\u201d to aid BHS pensioners. Field said Green, who is worth an estimated \u00a33.2bn, had promised to \u201csort\u201d the pension issue back in June but that there was still no concrete proposal on the table. Questioning whether Green had been a deserving recipient of a knighthood, Field said: \u201cThere was nothing the committee could find that shows Sir Philip Green is the king of the high street. He was a very, very, successful asset stripper.\u201d Green was honoured by the Blair government in 2006. Also speaking in parliament, Iain Wright, who co-chaired the select committee investigation with Field as chair of the business, innovation and skills select committee, told MPs that the failure of BHS was \u201cone of the biggest corporate scandals of modern times\u201d. \u201cGreen took the rings from BHS\u2019s fingers, beat it black and blue, starved it of food and water, put it on life support, and then wanted credit for keeping it alive,\u201d said Wright, referring to the \u00a3400m in BHS dividends paid to the Green family in the early years of their stewardship. Wright also questioned whether Green deserved acclaim for his skills as a retailer, suggesting his prowess lay in cutting costs and financial engineering with the bosses of rival chains such as John Lewis and Zara more deserving of plaudits. \u201cGreen can\u2019t be described as a short-term corporate raider, but raid the company he did,\u201d he said, adding that the Green family had sought to enrich itself at \u201cthe expense of long-term and sustainable growth for the company\u201d. \u201cCertainly, profits were made, but they were more akin to a short-term sugar boost rather than a nutritious diet that aided the long-term health and strength of the business [BHS],\u201d concluded Wright. MPs voted in favour of the motion by acclamation, meaning that there was no opposition from parliamentarians on the chamber floor when the speaker put it to them. Despite the strong signal sent by the vote, the power to rescind a knighthood rests with the honours forfeiture committee, a group of civil servants and dignitaries chaired by Sir Jonathan Stephens, a permanent secretary. Richard Fuller, the Tory MP who tabled the amendment calling for Green\u2019s knighthood, said that although MPs could not remove the honour they were able to reflect the views of their constituents. \u201cWe do not make the final decision but it is worthy and honourable for this house to have a view about Sir Philip Green,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the summer, he has had the opportunity to find his moral compass and do the right thing. In the absence of that, the house has no option but to support the amendment and the motion.\u201d The parliamentary inquiry into the collapse of BHS has strained relations between Green and MPs to breaking point, with a war of words between the tycoon and Field. The Labour MP for Birkenhead has riled the businessman by telling him to \u201cstop messing around and write a big cheque\u201d. Green sold BHS for \u00a31 in 2015 to investors led by Dominic Chappell, who had previously been declared bankrupt. The administrators were called in April this year but with no white knight willing to take on the loss-making chain, the last of its 170 stores shut at the end of the summer. Green\u2019s business reputation was savaged in the BHS postmortem report published by MPs on Field and Wright\u2019s committees. The report found that BHS was subject to \u201csystematic plunder\u201d by Green and Chappell and concluded there was \u201clittle to support the reputation for retail business acumen for which [Green] received his knighthood\u201d. Field told the chamber that the time had come for Green to face up to his \u201cmega, mega, mega-moral responsibility\u201d. In the wake of the damning BHS report Theresa May has promised to \u201creform capitalism\u201d and stamp out irresponsible corporate behaviour. But the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said Green\u2019s knighthood was a matter for the forfeiture committee: \u201cIt\u2019s a completely independent body and it doesn\u2019t give us any guidance on what it is looking at. MPs have had their say but it\u2019s a matter for the committee.\u201d At the start of this week Green had made a fresh appeal to his former employees, stating he was \u201cvery, very, very sorry\u201d for the collapse of BHS and claiming that his advisers are close to brokering a deal with the Pensions Regulator that would avoid a rescue by the pension protection fund (PPF). However earlier this week the Pensions Regulator issued a statement that indicated a deal was still some way off as it was \u201cyet to receive a comprehensive and credible written proposal\u201d from the Green camp.",

      "bodyText": "With nothing much in the European Central Bank latest deliberations to rock the boat, stock markets managed to end the day in positive territory, even as the euro was put under pressure. The banking sector was boosted by this week\u2019s positive results from US financial businesses, with BNY Mellon being the latest to report better than expected figures. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.07% or just 4.98 points at 7026.90 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.52% to 10,701.39 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.44% to 4540.12 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was up 0.57% at 17,141.38 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.24% higher at 9061.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.49% to 595.90 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently fairly steady, up 7 points or 0.04%. Elsewhere the pound is down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2255, and up 0.14% at \u20ac1.1212. Against the dollar the euro has fallen 0.39% to a four month low of $1.0930. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Meanwhile over in Greec, Mario Draghi\u2019s statements today are not going down well. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The ECB president\u2019s assertion this afternoon that it is premature to contemplate Greece being included in the bank\u2019s quantitative easing program before its debt is made sustainable has landed with the force of a lead balloon in Athens. \u201cIt effectively kills any prospect of debt forgiveness any time soon,\u201d said one well-placed source in the governing Syriza party. \u201cHow, in God\u2019s name, is the economy ever to recover after seven years of recession and internal deflation?\u201d Both investors and government officials say inclusion in the program would be a mood changer for a country enduring its worst slump in modern times. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who has spent the day pushing for debt relief in meetings with top EU officials in Brussels, says inclusion in the program is essential if the debt-stricken nation is to return to capital markets and finally get some form of primary debt relief. Greece has been excluded from QE because of its low credit rating. Tsipras has called for a debt deal to be concluded by December when Athens hopes to have completed its second review of the economy with international inspectors representing the EU and IMF. The audit begins in earnest tomorrow when Tsipras will also be pressing the point in talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel. The euro is still at four month lows against the dollar, but the pound is not looking too rosy either. Sterling is suffering as EU leaders arrive for their latest summit in Brussels, with EC president Donald Tusk saying there would be no pre-Article 50 negotiations about the UK leaving Europe. Meanwhile French president Francois Hollande said if Britain wanted a hard Brexit, negotiations would be hard. So the pound is down 0.36% at $1.2237 and virtually unchanged against the euro at \u20ac1.1201. Most analysts seem agreed that Mario Draghi\u2019s comments suggest the ECB will unveil plans to extend its quantitative easing measures at its December meeting. Marco Valli, chief eurozone economist at UniCredit Research, said: Draghi\u2019s remarks do support our view that in December QE will be extended beyond March 2017 at the current pace... So any policy decision will be announced on 8 December, when the new macroeconomic projections will be published (they will include for the first time numbers for 2019). What will the ECB do at that meeting? We remain convinced that the general council will opt for an extension of QE by six to nine months at the current pace. This would require \u20ac480-720bn of additional purchasable assets. We estimate that, under current market conditions, raising the ISIN limit from 33% to 50% and applying the deposit-rate restriction to a portfolio of bonds rather than to individual bonds would free a sufficient amount of German paper to make this extension possible. Bank bond purchases do not seem to be on the agenda, while a deposit rate cut remains highly unlikely as its side effects would outweigh the benefits. ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said: It would go too far to call this the Americanisation of the Eurozone. But the outcome of today\u2019s ECB meeting showed some imitations of last night\u2019s presidential debate in the US; at least in terms of memorable statements. Whether it is on tapering, the extension of QE or solutions to the scarcity problem, the ECB is keeping everyone in suspense. At least until the December meeting. [So] what are the take-aways from today\u2019s meeting? In our view, the ECB is not yet ready to extend QE. The recovery of the Eurozone economy is not weak enough to justify more stimulus but also not strong enough to light-heartedly talk about tapering. This is why the ECB is simply buying time. Mario Draghi\u2019s elegant balancing between tapering and an extension of QE keeps all expectations alive and could have one welcome fall-out: slightly higher long-term rates which will bring some relief to the scarcity problem without panic. At the December meeting, our view is that the ECB will announce an extension of QE until the end of 2017, possibly at a slower pace than the current \u20ac80bn. Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, said: There was only a small chance that Mr Draghi would discuss an extension of QE today, following the recent reports that ECB had begun to consider a taper of the programme. In the event, he chose not to. A more appropriate time to do this will be at the next ECB meeting in December, when bank staff have had a chance to revise their economic forecasts. Growth in the Eurozone remains sluggish but steady, with no sign of any major impact from the Brexit vote. Very low core inflation and wage growth should most concern policy makers, and are the main reasons we expect a QE extension in March. But Kathleen Brooks at City Index said although an extension was likely in December, it was not entirely guaranteed: Although we believe that deflation risks in the Eurozone are receding, we still don\u2019t think that the Eurozone economy is out of the deflationary woods yet, so QE is unlikely to end anytime soon. We do expect the ECB to announce that it will lengthen its asset purchase programme when it ends in March 2017, market expectations are for an announcement at its next policy meeting in December. However, we think that there is a small but significant chance that the ECB may hold off from expanding its QE programme, or it may only extend it in the short-term, as the ECB\u2019s whopping \u20ac3.5 trillion balance sheet creates a liquid monetary environment even if QE stops. Even though the ECB didn\u2019t take new measures today, Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference was packed with interesting elements. So what did we learn? Mario Draghi dropped a clear hint that the ECB could boost its asset purchase scheme in December. He said: We will continue to act, if warranted, by using all the instruments available within our mandate... In December the Governing Council\u2019s assessment will benefitf rom the new staff macroeconomic projections extending through 2019 and from the work of the Eurosystem committees on the options to ensure the smooth implementation of our purchase programme until March 2017 or beyond if necessary.\u201d Draghi also appeared to back up recent reports that the ECB could \u2018taper\u2019 its QE programme, which is currently buying \u20ac80bn of new bonds each month. He said: \u201cAn abrupt ending to bond purchases? I would say it\u2019s unlikely.\u201d But Draghi also insisted that the Governing Council did not discuss extending QE, or tapering, at today\u2019s meeting. This sent the euro on a wild ride, jumping initially before then hitting a four-month low. Draghi sounded cautious about the eurozone economy, saying that it was showing \u201cresilience to the adverse effects of global economic and political uncertainty\u201d. And he repeated his regular call for eurozone governments to make their economies more competitive, and to get more people into work. The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up to reduce structural unemployment and boost potential output growth in the euro area. Structural reforms are necessary in all euro area countries. The focus should be on actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, which are vital to increase investment and boost job creation. Draghi denied that he felt threatened by recent criticism of central banks, notably by UK prime minister Theresa May. No, I don\u2019t feel threatened. Neither is the independence of monetary policy by the governing council threatened. He insisted that QE didn\u2019t cause long-term inequality, on the grounds that it helped to get people into work. The point is, and there is actually an interesting study by the Bundesbank on whether, more generally, non-conventional monetary policy measures increase inequality. The answer is by and large no. The reason is that the main source of inequality is unemployment. So to the extent that the monetary policy is effective, it will reduce inequality. Although, as you buy assets from people who are wealthy, in the short run, you certainly increase inequality. And he also warned that Portugal would no longer be eligible for the ECB\u2019s QE programme, if its credit rating is downgraded tomorrow. Here\u2019s a word cloud of Mario Draghi\u2019s opening statement, showing how it was packed with references to growth, inflation, and the \u201ccontinued moderate but steady recovery\u201d in the euro area. You can see the full statement here: Mario Draghi still has the power to move the markets! The single currency has fallen to its lowest level since the EU referendum in June, after the ECB president hinted that the ECB could agree new stimulus measures at its December meeting. It hit a low of $1.0942, a four month low. Clearly the press pack have got bored of Mario Draghi not giving more details about its QE plans. We\u2019ve run out of questions, so the press conference has ended early. Q: Since June the ECB has bought 660 corporate bonds, including from companies such as Nestle and Glencore who have nothing to do with the eurozone. And by driving down the cost of borrowing for large companies, you help them take over smaller ones. How can you justify it? I don\u2019t have to justify it. It\u2019s not true, Draghi insists. He argues that smaller companies also benefit from the ECB\u2019s bond-buying, as it encourages banks to lend more to SMEs. That pushes down their borrowing costs. However, he doesn\u2019t say why the ECB has bought bonds issued by nine Swiss companies. Q: Did the ECB profit from the story, run on Bloomberg last week, that the ECB was considering tapering its QE programme (which drove down bond prices). Draghi looks a little pained at the very thought! I never though we could profit from sudden moves, coming from unauthorized and probably uninformed sources, he insists. I have no idea if the ECB profited out of it. But I can only reiterate that profit is not how we run monetary policy, he adds. And on the general issue of whether to taper or not, Draghi says: My perception is that the \u2018sudden stop\u2019 isn\u2019t present in anyone\u2019s mind That\u2019s another hint that the ECB may indeed taper the programme down, gradually, from the \u20ac80bn of bonds it\u2019s buying each month today. Q: Would you stop buying Portuguese bonds if Portugal is downgraded by the DBRS credit rating agency tomorrow? Draghi confirms that a downgrade would mean that Portugal wouldn\u2019t be automatically eligible for QE. But he also praises Portugal\u2019s progress, hinting that the country wouldn\u2019t be hoofed out into the cold. Q: What do you think about Theresa May\u2019s criticism on quantitative easing and low interest rates, and her attack on the Bank of England? Do you think the independence of central banks is being threatened? No, I don\u2019t feel threatened. Nor is the independence of the governing council threatened, says Mario Draghi firmly. Draghi says the ECB has looked at the issue of income inequality. By and large, he insists, loose monetary policy does not increase inequality, because inequality is primarily caused by unemployment. But he concedes that QE does drive up asset prices (and thus help wealthier people, as Theresa May said this month). Q: Is the ECB worried about running out of bonds to purchase under QE? Draghi says that bond scarcity was discussed during today\u2019s meeting. But it\u2019s not a problem now; the ECB\u2019s asset purchase scheme is running well. [this is because current rules restrict how many bonds the ECB can buy from each country, and at what yield levels] And down goes the euro again.... A question about the eurozone\u2019s new bail-in rules. Is the ECB ready to handle a problem with a large financial institution? Draghi says the bail-in rules have enough flexibility to cope with different scenarios. However, he doesn\u2019t see any possibility of this having to be tested at present. Draghi is giving the German bond market some terrible palpitations! Q: Was there any discussion of negative interest rates? We discussed low interest rates, during our assessment of the economic situation, Draghi replies. And our conclusion was that they don\u2019t hinder the transmission of monetary policy. Low interest rates work, he insists. Q: Is it possible that the ECB might not taper its bond purchase scheme, and might just abruptly end the purchases? It wasn\u2019t discussed, says Draghi, but then he decides to waft at this mischievously phrased question: An abrupt end to bond purchases? I think it\u2019s unlikely. That sounds like a hint that the ECB would slow the pace of bond purchases, not simply go from \u20ac80bn to \u20ac0. Q: Why is the ECB waiting until December? Because we want to get all the information possible, so we can make a full decision, Draghi says. Right now we have options. And we didn\u2019t go into counting views, or majorities, today. It is clear that in December we will tell you what we will do in the coming months, says Draghi. We didn\u2019t discuss tapering our asset purchase programme, or the possible horizon at which QE might end, Draghi insists. The euro has jumped half a cent, to $1.1033, after Draghi says the ECB didn\u2019t discuss boosting its QE programme today. Q: How will the ECB assess whether to take new action in December (as Draghi seemed to hint earlier)? Draghi says the ECB wants to see a \u201cself-sustained convergence\u201d in the eurozone economy - one that could last without the ECB\u2019s stimulus measures. So we would look through \u2018blips\u2019 that are caused by other factors, he adds. Q: Did the governing council discuss extending its asset purchase scheme beyond March 2017? No, says Draghi, firmly. Draghi ends his statement with his traditional call for Eurozone politicians to pull their socks up. The pace of structural reforms need to be stepped up, he insists, to create new jobs - and fully reap the benefits of loose monetary policy. All eurozone countries would benefit from structural reforms, he insists (he means you, Germany). And he cites the need for governments to invest in new infrastructure projects. That would help growth, and protect the eurozone economy from global shocks. Draghi predicts that inflation (currently 0.4%) will continue to rise in the next couple of months. But that\u2019s mainly due to \u2018base effects\u2019 (because oil was even cheaper a year ago), rather than a general rise in inflationary pressures. BOOM! Mario Draghi then drops a hint that the ECB could, as suspected, unleash new stimulus measure in December. He says that the governing council is still committed to preserving \u201cthe very substantial degree of monetary accommodation\u201d in the eurozone. And we will continue to act, if warranted, by using all the instruments at our disposal, he continued. In December, our assessment will benefit from new macroeconomic projections drawn up by ECB forecasters, he concludes. The ECB has also tweeted these points (to make sure everyone got the message) Draghi confirms that the ECB left its key interest rates unchanged at today\u2019s meeting, and expect them to stay at present or lower levels for an extended period of times. He also confirms that the ECB expects to run its QE scheme at \u20ac80bn per month until March 2017, or later, and at least until the ECB has hit its inflation targets. Then onto the details... We expect the eurozone economy to keep growing at a moderate and steady rate, he says. The eurozone also continued to show \u201cresilience\u201d to economic and political uncertainty, Draghi adds -- a nod to the Brexit vote. But the risks are still tilted to the downside. Mario Draghi has marched forcefully into the press conference, chatting with ECB vice-president V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio. After a quick smile for the photographers, Draghi starts to read his statement.... Here\u2019s the live feed for Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference, which starts in 10 minutes (I\u2019ll embed it at the top of this blog too) Economists are predicting a dovish performance from Mario Draghi at his press conference, and hints of new stimulus measures at the next meeting in December. This is from Nick Kounis at ABN Amro: Michala Marcussen, global head of economics at Societe Generale, told Bloomberg TV that: \u201cWhat we are expecting today is Draghi to sound quite dovish in his overall tone...come December, we do expect them to tweak the parameters around the QE program.\u201d And this is from Reuters: \u201cI will not be surprised to see some bounce [in the euro] later on,\u201d said Niels Christensen, a currency strategist at Nordea. He expects Draghi to reiterate his commitment to looser monetary policy and quash talk of any tapering of the asset purchase programme. No significant reaction in the financial markets - the euro is still trading around $1.0975. European stock markets are still pretty dull too, with the French CAC and German DAX both up around 0.15%. Mario Draghi may shake things up soon, though.... So, the ECB has postposed its decision on extending its QE programme for another day.... Here\u2019s Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet: Eurozone crisis watcher Yannis Koutsomitis tweets: While Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi is very excited about Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference, in 35 minutes.... Today\u2019s ECB statement is identical to last month\u2019s! Well, there is one slight difference... Monetary policy decisions At today\u2019s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively. The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that the monthly asset purchases of \u20ac80 billion are intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until it sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today. The ECB has also left its quantitative easing programme unchanged, at \u20ac80bn per month. BREAKING: The European Central Bank has left interest rates across the eurozone unchanged at their current record lows, at today\u2019s policy meeting. That means that: The headline interest rate remains at 0.00% The deposit facility remains at -0.4%. That means that banks will still be charged to leave money in the ECB\u2019s vaults. The marginal lending facility remains at +0.25%. That\u2019s the rate paid by commercial banks when they borrow from the ECB. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga predicts we could see wild volatility in the markets if Mario Draghi suggests that the ECB could slow, or taper, its bond-buying programme. He writes: A growing sense of anticipation firmly gripped the financial markets on Thursday as investors prepared for the European Central Bank meeting which most hope could provide clues about a possible extension to the QE program. While it is widely expected that interest rates and the current \u20ac80 billion bond buying remains unchanged in October, the press conference where Draghi may be bombarded by taper questions could spark explosive levels of volatility. With European inflation still well below the golden 2% target and unemployment hovering around 10%, the taper scenario looks quite premature. It seems likely that the ECB adopts an inactive stance this month before potentially taking action in December when the new inflation estimates will be released The euro hit a three-month low of $1.095 against the US dollar this morning, ahead of the ECB decision, and Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says investors are looking for Draghi to hint at fresh stimulus moves: ECB day has arrived, and as a result markets are becalmed, waiting to see what the oracle of Frankfurt will pronounce. Having firmly shot down reports of tapering, the ECB meeting will be closely-watched for any sign that the bank is looking to broaden its options with respect to more QE in coming months. Clearly the euro thinks looser policy is coming, as the currency slumps to its lowest level since July. The Germans might not be keen on further stimulus, but they\u2019ll be even less keen on a stronger euro that hits exports, having already suffered this to some extent due to the fall in sterling, which will boost the price of German imports into the key UK market. Fidelity International have issued a very useful note, outlining how the European Central Bank could run short of bonds to buy -- if it extends its QE programme significantly. Currently, the ECB owns around 15% of all eurozone government debt; similar to the US Federal Reserve, but less than the Bank of Japan (which now holds 38% of Japanese sovereign bonds). Fidelity\u2019s Dierk Brandenburg says: The ECB is not yet facing quite such a dearth of suitable bonds to buy, but there are growing signs of scarcity. The ECB\u2019s bond holdings as a proportion of the market are smaller than the BoJ\u2019s and even the Fed\u2019s, but its share is rising fast: And unless the ECB changes the rules, restricting how much of each country\u2019s bonds it can buy - and at what price - it could hit a serious problem if it extends QE beyond March 2017 (when it is due to end). Brandenburg explains: The ECB has a self-imposed restriction of owning no more than 33% of any country\u2019s outstanding debt and no more than 25% of outstanding CAC (collective-action clause3) debt. Yet the ECB owns 21% of all outstanding German bunds and could find it has broadly reached the country limit within 15 months, assuming purchases continue through March 2017 at the target pace. This is further complicated by another rule; the ECB cannot purchase bonds yielding below the ECB\u2019s deposit rate \u2013 that excludes 43% of German bonds, one of the largest and most liquid sovereign bond classes.4 At its September press conference, the Bank did not specifically mention investigating bond scarcity, to the chagrin of some commentators, but it did say it had \u201ctasked the relevant committees to evaluate the options to ensure a smooth implementation of our purchase programme\u201d. The final restriction is the ECB\u2019s capital key. This prescribes the proportion of bonds to buy from each issuer based on the size of the country\u2019s population and economy. For Germany, the capital key indicates 25% of all bond purchases should be from this country. Given that 43% of German bonds trade below the deposit rate, it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult for the ECB to fulfil the capital key. We can expect Mario Draghi to be grilled on this issue later today... Just one hour to go until the European Central Bank announces the results of today\u2019s governing council meeting. Most economists expect the ECB will not take any significant decisions, but could prepare the markets for an expanded stimulus push in December: Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s retail sales figures: Jon Copestake, retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, is also struck by the jump in online shopping in September: The most significant take out from these results seems to be the 22% year on year rise in Internet sales. Although this comes from a relatively low base it means that online sales accounted for some 15% of total retail sales in September. The introduction of grocery lines to Amazon\u2019s offering and expansion of online sales and delivery platforms from the \u201cbig four\u201d retailers hints that buying groceries online may be becoming more prevalent, Food retailers have seen online sales doubling in the last five year Economist Marcus Wright also predicts that higher inflation (driven up by the weak pound) will send a shiver through the high street: Britain\u2019s shops have probably enjoyed one \u2018last hurrah\u2019, before rising inflation hits the high street. So warns Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club: \u201cInflation is now likely to pick up sharply, as the impact of the depreciation in the value of sterling steadily passes through to consumer prices. The degree to which retailers pass on rising import costs remains to be seen, but there is certainly a sense that the strong Q3 figures for retail sales volumes are likely to represent a last hurrah for the high street, with a more challenging period to come for retailers and consumers alike.\u201d Fran Marwood, Retail and Consumer Partner at PwC, points out that the weak pound has helped retailers, by encouraging more foreign tourists to visit the UK. But she also flags up that shops have some tough decisions to make, as the cost of imported goods rise. She says: \u201cDespite softening performance in the sector, consumer confidence appears to be holding up well against the backdrop of the Brexit vote earlier in the Summer.\u201d \u201cRetailers, as we saw in the press with the recent Marmite row, will be seeking to handle the effects of costlier imports as currency hedges expire. An added dimension this year will be the split of Christmas spending between the high street and online as traditional businesses seek to remain competitive on price and manage an increasing cost base.\u201d Reminder: Nestle told investors this morning it is considering efficiency savings, and price rises, to counter the slump in sterling. Some economists are concerned that UK retail sale were flat month-on-month in September. That could be a sign that consumer confidence is cooling, after a boisterous summer. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics reckons the era of price-cutting, which helped drive sales, is ending. So as the weak pound drives up import costs, consumers could suffer. He writes: Growth in retail sales is losing momentum now that retailers are no longer cutting prices aggressively. Retail sales volumes held steady in both August and September, and while the 2% month-to-month surge in July means that volumes rose by 1.8% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter of 2016 \u2014 the best result since Q4 2014 \u2014 volumes won\u2019t rise by anywhere near that amount in Q4. Indeed, the surge in sales in July was fuelled by clothing retailers slashing prices. As clothing prices have risen over the last two months, July\u2019s 5.9% month-to-month gain in clothing sales volumes has been fully reversed. Retailers now have finished passing on savings from lower import prices to consumers, and will soon begin to pass on higher import prices that have resulted from sterling\u2019s depreciation. He also sent this chart, showing how inflationary pressures are building (the yellow line): Online shopping helped to drive UK retail sales up since the Brexit vote, points out economist Rupert Seggins: The UK economy appears to have held up well since the Brexit vote, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. Here\u2019s his take on the strong retail sales spending over the last three months: While flat retail sales in September could be a sign that consumers are starting to rein in their spending as inflation rises, it should be borne in mind that sales were held back in September by warm weather markedly hitting demand for autumn clothing. Higher clothing prices were also seemingly a factor. Furthermore, retail sales were still very strong over the third quarter as a whole, and there could have been an element of some consumers taking a breather after splashing out over the summer. Indeed, retail sales volumes still grew 1.8% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, which was the best performance since the fourth quarter of 2014. This fuels belief that the consumer played a leading role in the apparent resilience of the economy following June\u2019s Brexit vote. Here\u2019s ONS senior statistician Kate Davies on today\u2019s retail sales report: \u201cRetail sales in September 2016 were unchanged from August 2016, however the underlying trend is one of strength, suggesting consumer confidence has remained steady since June\u2019s referendum. There was some variation between store types, clothing stores saw a fall in the quantity bought in part due to rising prices and a warmer than average September.\u201d These charts underline how UK retail sales have remained strong in the three months after the Brexit vote. Today\u2019s report shows they grew by 1.8% during the July-September quarter, and 5.4% year-on-year - the biggest rise since the last quarter of 2014. BREAKING: UK retail sales were a little weaker than expected last month but there\u2019s still no sign of a serious Brexit slowdown. Retail sales were flat in September itself, missing expectations of a 0.3% increase. On an annual basis, they grew by 4.1%, which is also weaker than expected. The Office for National Statistics says rising clothes prices, and an \u2018unusually warm\u2019 September, hit demand for autumn and winter clothing. BUT... August\u2019s figures have been revised higher, to show blistering annual growth of 6.6%. And that means retail sales in the last quarter were 5.4% higher than a year ago - the strongest growth since late 2014. The ONS says that the underlying trend in retail sales is still strong, suggesting consumer confidence is steady since the June referendum. ECB expert Frederik Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet predicts that Mario Draghi will dampen speculation about \u2018tapering\u2019 its QE programme, at today\u2019s press conference. He says: We think that Draghi will \u2018taper the taper talks\u2019 for now, saying that a large majority of governing council members believe that it is too early to make such plans. Ducrozet also believes the ECB will expand its QE programme in December. Here\u2019s a bit from his latest research note (online here) In terms of how much additional QE is needed, our long-held forecast of a 6- month extension at the current \u20ac80bn monthly pace looks consistent with the ECB\u2019s own estimates of QE effects. Indeed, Draghi and his colleagues have mentioned the same numbers on several occasions, noting that the December 2015 and March 2016 ECB packages are expected to provide a 0.4 percentage point boost to inflation over two years. Those two packages together amounted to a \u20ac600bn increase in asset purchases. Using the same rule of thumb, a 6-month extension at the current pace would add \u20ac480bn to QE, providing an inflation boost of up to 0.3pp even accounting for diminishing marginal benefits. French bank BNP Paribas predict that the European Central Bank will resist launching new stimulus moves today: We expect the ECB to buy time at its meeting today and postpone any decision on tweaking its quantitative easing programme until December, when the ECB publishes the next round of its staff projections. Shares in Nestl\u00e9 have dropped by 1.5% in early trading after the food group cut its sales targets and reported slower growth this year. Food deflation in Europe, and economic problems in Brazil, meant Nestl\u00e9\u2019s sales growth fell to 3.3% in the first nine months of 2016. It now only expects full-year growth of 3.5%, down from a previous target of 4.2%. The company also suggested it may hike the prices of goods, like KitKat chocolate bars and Carnation condensed milk, following the slump in the pound. But it\u2019s not planning to pull out of the UK, at least until it knows what Brexit will look like. Reutets has the details: Nestle will not adjust its investments in Britain because of Brexit before details of the country\u2019s exit from the European Union is clear, its CEO said on Thursday, though it is examining price rises to deal with a sharp fall in the currency. \u201cLet\u2019s first let the dust settle,\u201d chief executive Paul Bulcke said, adding that investments in the country were for the long term. Regarding the currency, Bulcke said Nestle\u2019s UK team was looking at all options to deal with the fall in the pound, including efficiency efforts that can absorb part of it, and price rises. Europe\u2019s financial markets have opened very quietly, as investors await news from the European Central Bank. The FTSE 100 has dipped by 9 points, or 0.1%, while the French and German markets are a little higher. The ECB has some good news this week, when eurozone inflation hit a two-year high of 0.4%. That suggests its massive stimulus plan may be having some effect, although inflation is still shy of its target of just below 2%. The ECB has already pumped hundreds of billions into the eurozone economy through QE, swelling its balance sheet to around \u20ac3.5 trillion (the purple line in the chart below). There are signs that bank lending is picking up too (green line) Analysts at RBC Capital Markets reckon that the European Central Bank won\u2019t take any big decisions today. But Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference will still be interesting, as the press probe him on the ECB\u2019s next move. RBC say: In summary the recent bond market sell-off has reduced the immediate pressure on the ECB to act and we do not expect major changes from today\u2019s meeting, However, we still expect that some action is likely to come before year end. Instead the focus should be trained on Draghi\u2019s words and whether he drops any clues on the findings of the review of QE announced last time out and how he deals with questions on the tapering rumours that have circulated in recent weeks. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019ve got the bunting out this morning because it\u2019s ECB Day. The Eurozone\u2019s top central bankers are gathering in Frankfurt to set monetary policy, and consider the state of Europe\u2019s economy. The European Central Bank\u2019s governing council needs to decide whether to take fresh action to stimulate inflation and growth. Its current quantitative easing (QE) programme expires in March 2017, and there have already been hints that it might be extended. Analysts are predicting that the ECB won\u2019t take any big decisions today, but might set the ground for fresh action at its December meeting, or early 2017. The decision comes at 12.45pm BST (1.45pm in Frankfurt). And then Mario Draghi, the ECB president, will hold a press conference at 1.30pm (2.30pm) Draghi can expect to be quizzed about a recent report that the ECB will eventually \u2018taper\u2019 its QE programme \u2013 ie, gradually trimming the amount of bonds it buys each months. Journalists may also try to get Draghi to comment on recent attacks on central banks from UK politicians, including prime minister Theresa May and ex-Conservative Party leader William Hague: Also coming up today... We get the latest UK retail sales figures at 9.30am. They\u2019ll show whether consumers continued to spend merrily in September despite the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote. Analysts predict that sales jumped by 4.4% year-on-year, following a 5.9% leap in August. Over in parliament, MPs will be debating whether to divest Sir Philip Green of his knighthood, over the collapse of his former BHS chain. And three former senior Tesco managers are appearing in court, to face charges over the multi-million pound black hole that was discovered in its accounts two years ago.",

What will the ECB do at that meeting? We remain convinced that the general council will opt for an extension of QE by six to nine months at the current pace. This would require \u20ac480-720bn of additional purchasable assets. We estimate that, under current market conditions, raising the ISIN limit from 33% to 50% and applying the deposit-rate restriction to a portfolio of bonds rather than to individual bonds would free a sufficient amount of German paper to make this extension possible. Bank bond purchases do not seem to be on the agenda, while a deposit rate cut remains highly unlikely as its side effects would outweigh the benefits.</p> </blockquote> <p>ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would go too far to call this the Americanisation of the Eurozone. But the outcome of today\u2019s ECB meeting showed some imitations of last night\u2019s presidential debate in the US; at least in terms of memorable statements. Whether it is on tapering, the extension of QE or solutions to the scarcity problem, the ECB is keeping everyone in suspense. At least until the December meeting.</p> <p>[So] what are the take-aways from today\u2019s meeting? In our view, the ECB is not yet ready to extend QE. The recovery of the Eurozone economy is not weak enough to justify more stimulus but also not strong enough to light-heartedly talk about tapering. This is why the ECB is simply buying time. Mario Draghi\u2019s elegant balancing between tapering and an extension of QE keeps all expectations alive and could have one welcome fall-out: slightly higher long-term rates which will bring some relief to the scarcity problem without panic. At the December meeting, our view is that the ECB will announce an extension of QE until the end of 2017, possibly at a slower pace than the current \u20ac80bn. </p> </blockquote> <p>Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was only a small chance that Mr Draghi would discuss an extension of QE today, following the recent reports that ECB had begun to consider a taper of the programme.</p> <p>In the event, he chose not to. A more appropriate time to do this will be at the next ECB meeting in December, when bank staff have had a chance to revise their economic forecasts.</p> <p>Growth in the Eurozone remains sluggish but steady, with no sign of any major impact from the Brexit vote. Very low core inflation and wage growth should most concern policy makers, and are the main reasons we expect a QE extension in March.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Kathleen Brooks at City Index said although an extension was likely in December, it was not entirely guaranteed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although we believe that deflation risks in the Eurozone are receding, we still don\u2019t think that the Eurozone economy is out of the deflationary woods yet, so QE is unlikely to end anytime soon. We do expect the ECB to announce that it will lengthen its asset purchase programme when it ends in March 2017, market expectations are for an announcement at its next policy meeting in December. However, we think that there is a small but significant chance that the ECB may hold off from expanding its QE programme, or it may only extend it in the short-term, as the ECB\u2019s whopping \u20ac3.5 trillion balance sheet creates a liquid monetary environment even if QE stops.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5808cc8ce4b005f21833b77c\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T14:24:41.231Z\">3.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary: Draghi hints at more action</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Even though the ECB didn\u2019t take new measures today, Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference was packed with interesting elements.

Yet the ECB owns 21% of all outstanding German bunds and could find it has broadly reached the country limit within 15 months, assuming purchases continue through March 2017 at the target pace.</p> <p> This is further complicated by another rule; the ECB cannot purchase bonds yielding below the ECB\u2019s deposit rate \u2013 that excludes 43% of German bonds, one of the largest and most liquid sovereign bond classes.4 At its September press conference, the Bank did not specifically mention investigating bond scarcity, to the chagrin of some commentators, but it did say it had \u201ctasked the relevant committees to evaluate the options to ensure a smooth implementation of our purchase programme\u201d.</p> <p>The final restriction is the ECB\u2019s capital key. This prescribes the proportion of bonds to buy from each issuer based on the size of the country\u2019s population and economy. For Germany, the capital key indicates 25% of all bond purchases should be from this country.

      "bodyText": "Southern has promised to restore its full timetable from 31 October, after almost four months of running an emergency timetable with hundreds of trains cancelled every day. The move at the start of July had been billed as a short-term fix to the disruption affecting Southern, allowing a more predictable \u2013 if reduced \u2013 level of service for the hundreds of thousands of passengers travelling daily on its trains. Southern cut 341 trains a day, or about 15% of its services, in July, and more than 100 have yet to be reinstated. Strikes, as well as levels of sickness that Southern and rail ministers have denounced as unofficial industrial action, have compounded staff shortages and other problems on the troubled Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise. The company said it was now able to restore the services by getting more employees back to work as well as appointing more staff as onboard supervisors, the planned replacement for conductors. About 100 revenue protection staff have become onboard supervisors, freeing up more conductors to work on other routes. GTR said it has also recruited 270 additional drivers, with 262 more in training across the franchise. Southern passengers in Hove, Bognor and Worthing will have services restored from Monday next week, while trains running between Brighton and Southampton, and between Hastings and Ashford, will complete the timetable restoration at the end of the month. Charles Horton, the chief executive of GTR, Southern\u2019s operating company, said: \u201cThis is what our passengers deserve and I thank them for their patience during what has been a difficult time for everyone. \u201cClearly, the industrial relations issues we have are, regrettably, continuing, but we are pressing ahead with our plans and are committed to delivering a better service for everyone.\u201d GTR said 33 Gatwick Express services would not return until 12 December, however, in order to manage the impact of leaves on the line, which frequently cause delays and congestion in the autumn. The news came on the last day of a three-day strike by RMT conductors in the long-running dispute about changes to their role. The strike forced Southern to cut about two in five of its trains, although the company reported that an increasing number of conductors were defying the RMT leadership and returning to work. The RMT said it would call off its next planned day of action, saying it had heeded a request from the Royal British Legion not to strike on a day in the run-up to Remembrance Day, when the charity does the bulk of its fundraising in London. Walkouts planned for 4 and 5 November are due to go ahead, however, as will action on 22 and 23 November, and 6-8 December. Although Southern have been running services in the face of RMT action, further disruption could come after Aslef announced it was preparing to ballot drivers for action.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tax experts warned that HM Revenue &amp; Customs was underestimating the size of Britain\u2019s tax avoidance problem after the agency claimed that Britain\u2019s annual tax shortfall was only \u00a336bn \u2013 a figure that ignored controversial structures used by multinationals such as Google, Apple and Starbucks. Top HMRC officials will face questions from MPs next week over their refusal to challenge tax avoidance by multinational corporations. Members of the public accounts committee are also expected to further investigate HMRC\u2019s claims that its compliance team generated record revenues of \u00a326.6bn by chasing down tax dodgers. Official estimates from HMRC, published on Thursday, show Britain\u2019s public finances missed out on tax revenues of \u00a336bn in 2014-15. HMRC\u2019s tax gap figures have remained at about the same level for several years despite increasing claims the agency has made about the impact of its compliance work. In a report published this year, the public accounts committee noted: \u201cHMRC told us that its performance in addressing tax fraud was good. But HMRC\u2019s assessment of the tax gap shows that the level of tax fraud has remained virtually static over the last five years. The impact that HMRC claims for its work far exceeds any reduction in the tax gap.\u201d Next Wednesday, top HMRC officials are to appear before the committee again to answer questions about the tax office\u2019s performance. \u201cOne of the areas where we\u2019ll be focusing hard is on claims about [HMRC\u2019s] compliance performance,\u201d a source close to the committee said. The \u201ctax gap\u201d is the shortfall between the amount of tax expected in Treasury coffers and the sums actually received. The figure includes estimates for losses caused by tax evasion, avoidance, the hidden economy, errors and other non-payments. HMRC\u2019s tax gap figure has been repeatedly criticised because it does not take into account estimates for tax losses caused by multinational corporations such as Google, Amazon, Apple and Starbucks. These international businesses are able to lawfully use complex structures to shift taxable income from the UK to their operations overseas. A year ago, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said, based on extremely conservative estimates, profit-shifting by multinationals was costing governments between $100bn and $240bn (\u00a365bn to \u00a3160bn) a year in lost corporation tax \u2013 equivalent to between 4% and 10% of global corporation tax revenues. Some independent estimates of Britain\u2019s tax gap, including work by the tax campaigner Richard Murphy, have suggested the figure could have reached as much as \u00a3119bn in recent years, taking into account estimates of tax avoidance by multinationals. Of HMRC\u2019s \u00a336bn tax gap estimate for 2014-15, \u00a39.5bn was attributed to large businesses. Only \u00a3600m of that sum related to large business tax avoidance. That \u00a3600m estimate is equivalent to less than 1.5% of the \u00a341.4bn of corporation tax revenues for 2014-15. Prem Sikka, a professor of accounting at University of Essex, who has advised the Labour party on tax reform, said: \u201cHMRC\u2019s measure of the tax gap is not credible as it excludes profit-shifting techniques used by Google, Microsoft, Apple and others.\u201d In a recent report for Labour, Sikka said: \u201cThe [HMRC tax gap] estimate depends on the policies and practices that HMRC is willing to accept or challenge ... HMRC has not challenged [multinationals\u2019] tax practices whereas other countries have shown a greater willingness to challenge the same.\u201d Alex Cobham, research director at Tax Justice Network, said: \u201c There is a real risk that this tax gap analysis may be taken seriously as the basis for policy \u2013 in which case HMRC would continue to ignore the major revenue risks represented by multinationals. It\u2019s important for public confidence, as much as for better policymaking, that HMRC swiftly addresses this spurious estimate.\u201d But, on Thursday, the Treasury minister Jane Ellison said: \u201cThis government is committed to tackling tax evasion and avoidance wherever it occurs. The UK has one of the lowest tax gaps in the world. By investing \u00a31.8bn since 2010 in boosting HMRC compliance capabilities, we\u2019ve brought our tax gap down to its lowest ever level.\u201d The official tax gap estimate of \u00a336bn \u2013 equivalent to 6.5% of expected tax revenues \u2013 is down from \u00a337bn for 2013-14. HMRC\u2019s tax gap figure includes an estimate of losses caused by tax avoidance of \u00a32.2bn. Meanwhile, the hidden economy and tax evasion caused further estimated losses of \u00a36.2bn and \u00a35.2bn, respectively. In terms of which taxes involved the largest shortfalls, lost income tax, national insurance contributions and capital gains tax together contributed \u00a315.5bn to the tax gap. Uncollected VAT, corporation tax and excise duty amounted to \u00a312.7bn, \u00a33.7bn and 2.8bn, respectively. On Thursday it emerged that HMRC was looking into allegations, revealed in the Guardian, concerning the delivery firm Hermes. Some of its drivers said they believed they had been wrongly classed as self-employed workers and so were not getting the same rights as employees. \u201cIf we find that companies have misclassified individuals as self-employed, we will take all necessary steps to make sure they pay the appropriate tax, national insurance contributions, interest and penalties,\u201d HMRC\u2019s executive chairman, Edward Troup, said in a letter to Frank Field, chair of the Commons\u2019 work and pensions select committee.",

Members of the public accounts committee are also expected to further investigate HMRC\u2019s claims that its compliance team generated record revenues of \u00a326.6bn by chasing down tax dodgers.</p> <p>Official <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/561312/HMRC-measuring-tax-gaps-2016.pdf\">estimates from HMRC</a>, published on Thursday, show Britain\u2019s public finances missed out on tax revenues of \u00a336bn in 2014-15. HMRC\u2019s tax gap figures have remained at about the same level for several years despite increasing claims the agency has made about the impact of its compliance work. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmpubacc/674/67405.htm\">report published this year</a>, the public accounts committee noted: \u201cHMRC told us that its performance in addressing tax fraud was good. But HMRC\u2019s assessment of the tax gap shows that the level of tax fraud has remained virtually static over the last five years. The impact that HMRC claims for its work far exceeds any reduction in the tax gap.\u201d</p> <p>Next Wednesday, top <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/\">HMRC officials are to appear before the committee again</a> to answer questions about the tax office\u2019s performance. \u201cOne of the areas where we\u2019ll be focusing hard is on claims about [HMRC\u2019s] compliance performance,\u201d a source close to the committee said.</p> <p>The \u201ctax gap\u201d is the shortfall between the amount of tax expected in Treasury coffers and the sums actually received. The figure includes estimates for losses caused by tax evasion, avoidance, the hidden economy, errors and other non-payments.</p> <p>HMRC\u2019s tax gap figure has been repeatedly criticised because it does not take into account estimates for tax losses caused by multinational corporations such as Google, Amazon, Apple and Starbucks. These international businesses are able to lawfully use complex structures to shift taxable income from the UK to their operations overseas.</p> <p>A year ago, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said, based on extremely conservative estimates, profit-shifting by multinationals was <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps/\">costing governments between </a><a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps/\">$100bn and $240bn</a> (\u00a365bn to \u00a3160bn) a year in lost corporation tax \u2013 equivalent to between 4% and 10% of global corporation tax revenues.</p> <p>Some independent estimates of Britain\u2019s tax gap, including work by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/11/the-man-behind-corbynomics-an-accountant-from-leafy-norfolk\">tax campaigner Richard Murphy</a>, have suggested the figure<a href=\"http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/%20Documents/PCSTaxGap2014.pdf\"> could have reached as much as \u00a3119bn</a> in recent years, taking into account estimates of tax avoidance by multinationals. <br></p> <p>Of HMRC\u2019s \u00a336bn tax gap estimate for 2014-15, \u00a39.5bn was attributed to large businesses. Only \u00a3600m of that sum related to large business tax avoidance. That \u00a3600m estimate is equivalent to less than 1.5% of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446134/HMRC_Annual_Report_and_Accounts_2014-15__Print_version_.pdf\">\u00a341.4bn of corporation tax revenues for 2014-15</a>.</p> <p>Prem Sikka, a professor of accounting at University of Essex, who has advised the Labour party on tax reform, said: \u201cHMRC\u2019s measure of the tax gap is not credible as it excludes profit-shifting techniques used by Google, Microsoft, Apple and others.\u201d</p> <p>In<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=6&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7rau_r-nPAhXJJsAKHdQlCPEQFgg6MAU&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftaxwatch.org.au%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F09%2FReforming-HMRC-making-it-fit-for-the-twenty-first-century.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNFxqTp6IEA12VvOY8giGc9dNQoaQQ&amp;sig2=K1u3-29nZeqNK7EMDeGuzw&amp;bvm=bv.136499718,d.ZGg\"> a recent report for Labour, </a>Sikka said: \u201cThe [HMRC tax gap] estimate depends on the policies and practices that HMRC is willing to accept or challenge ... HMRC has not challenged [multinationals\u2019] tax practices whereas other countries have shown a greater willingness to challenge the same.\u201d <br></p> <p>Alex Cobham, research director at Tax Justice Network, said: \u201c There is a real risk that this tax gap analysis may be taken seriously as the basis for policy \u2013 in which case HMRC would continue to ignore the major revenue risks represented by multinationals. It\u2019s important for public confidence, as much as for better policymaking, that HMRC swiftly addresses this spurious estimate.\u201d </p> <p>But, on Thursday, the Treasury minister Jane Ellison said: \u201cThis government is committed to tackling tax evasion and avoidance wherever it occurs. The UK has one of the lowest tax gaps in the world. By investing \u00a31.8bn since 2010 in boosting HMRC compliance capabilities, we\u2019ve brought our tax gap down to its lowest ever level.\u201d</p> <p>The official tax gap estimate of \u00a336bn \u2013 equivalent to 6.5% of expected tax revenues \u2013 is down from \u00a337bn for 2013-14. <br></p> <p>HMRC\u2019s tax gap figure includes an estimate of losses caused by tax avoidance of \u00a32.2bn. Meanwhile, the hidden economy and tax evasion caused further estimated losses of \u00a36.2bn and \u00a35.2bn, respectively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d666f4dafc41774cda6591d82bfa3b22b6b7ac4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d666f4dafc41774cda6591d82bfa3b22b6b7ac4/0_3_801_481/500.jpg\" alt=\"HMRC estimates for Britain's tax gap\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Britain\u2019s tax gap</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HMRC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In terms of which taxes involved the largest shortfalls, lost income tax, national insurance contributions and capital gains tax together contributed \u00a315.5bn to the tax gap.

Some of its drivers said they believed they had been wrongly classed as self-employed workers and so were not getting the same rights as employees. </p> <p>\u201cIf we find that companies have misclassified individuals as self-employed, we will take all necessary steps to make sure they pay the appropriate tax, national insurance contributions, interest and penalties,\u201d HMRC\u2019s executive chairman, Edward Troup, said in a letter to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/frank-field\">Frank Field</a>, chair of the Commons\u2019 work and pensions select committee.</p>",

City of London Corporation published the proposals, drawn up by accountants PriceWaterhouseCoopers, after scrutinising the visa systems used in Australia and Canada. It outlines two ideas: one could be run by the local authorities which would listen to the business case for needing to recruit from abroad; the other would be run by UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) which would judge the merits of cases put forward. Regional visas, according to the report, would allow regional centres such as Manchester, Newcastle and Birmingham to become more competitive and lure more overseas talent. Individuals would be required to live in the area. \u201cA regional visa could present an opportunity for the UK to have a nuanced immigration system that successfully meets the requirements of UK business and economy post Brexit. Economies that are dependent on a single city hub are less resilient to global economic shocks. A regional visa system could facilitate and promote economic development outside of London,\u201d the report said. Immigration has been a key part of the Brexit debate. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, raised the idea of companies disclosing the proportion of foreigners they employ. \u201cBy allowing the regions to control immigration this will recognise the fact that the needs of London and Yorkshire will differ dramatically. Whilst all regions will have to adhere to the same overall requirement criteria set by the Home Office they will be allowed to control the numbers of migrants and the skills they require for their region,\u201d the report said. It is not clear what visa regime will apply to EU workers after Brexit, but the report said that if the current visa system was applied around three-quarters of Britain\u2019s EU workforce would not meet these requirements. This could have an impact on the City of London \u2013 where 32% of the workforce is international, with 12% hailing from Europe. It would also affect healthcare, agriculture and construction. Australia and Canada are seen as the most relevant comparisons for a UK regional visa. The report said: \u201cBoth countries designed their systems to attract migrants to help combat problems of sparsely populated regions and declining populations. Whilst we acknowledge that a post-Brexit visa system will have different motivations, the mechanisms and lessons are relevant, as these relate to tying migration to particular area needs.\u201d Australia uses a regional sponsored migration scheme where a three-year visa is granted for workers sponsored by employers. Canada has a four-year programme where employers are able to hire from abroad when they have not been able to recruit at home. The UK could adopt two types of visas \u2013 a 12-month visa for those recruited to fill a skills shortage or one for six years to fill a permanent role that could also lead to permanent residency after five years. Individuals entering the UK on the longer term visa would be permitted to purchase property in the area where they had been granted permission to work. \u201cThis is not a London solution to a national problem, but actually something that can support growth outside of the capital across a wide variety of sectors,\u201d said Mark Boleat, policy chairman at the City of London Corporation.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green pledged to resolve the pension problems facing BHS before selling it and broke promises on supporting the new owner, according to the man who bought the department store chain from the billionaire tycoon. In fresh evidence submitted to MPs, Dominic Chappell said that his consortium Retail Acquisitions had bid for BHS on the basis that the company would be debt free and that Green had promised to help the new owner to secure credit insurance, which is vital for the survival of retailers. Chappell made the submission to MPs on the eve of a debate in the House of Commons about whether Green should keep his knighthood. Asked by the Guardian whether Green should be stripped of his title, Chappell said: \u201cYes he should. He pushed the business over and he did not stick to his word. He is a bully and a nasty individual. I am bitter about what has happened. There are 11,000 people out of work that would not have been if he had stuck to his word, and there is carnage on the high street.\u201d Chappell controversially bought BHS for \u00a31 from Green in March 2015 despite having been declared bankrupt three times and having no experience of running a high street retailer. The company collapsed just 13 months later, but Retail Acquisitions received payments of at least \u00a317m from the retailer, according to evidence seen by MPs. The demise of BHS led to 11,000 job losses and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Its failure is already under investigation by the Insolvency Service and the Pensions Regulator, while the Serious Fraud Office is also conducting preliminary inquiries into the demise of BHS and the actions of Retail Acquistions. Green told ITV this week that selling BHS to Chappell was an \u201chonest mistake\u201d and that he was \u201cvery, very, very sorry\u201d. In his new evidence, Chappell claims that Retail Acquisitions \u201cprovided substantial and valuable services to BHS\u201d and \u201craised substantial money and procured substantial savings for BHS in its reconstruction of the business\u201d. He denied there had been improper financial dealings on the part of Retail Acquistions. He added: \u201cRAL\u2019s [Retail Acquistions\u2019] bid was predicated on the basis that BHS would be debt free and that any exposure to the pension would be extremely limited and be covered by contributions from its day-to-day trade. \u201cExpert advice was taken by RAL prior to purchase concerning the pension. It was stated by all, including Arcadia [Green\u2019s retail business] and Sir Philip Green, that the pension was in the process of being sorted and was not something that the new owners and manager of BHS would be liable for, provided BHS continued to make the annual contributions for the yearly shortfall and continued engaging with the pension trustees.\u201d Chappell said Retail Acquisitions was \u201cassured by SPG [Sir Philip Green] that there were negotiations under way\u201d with the Pensions Regulator about a pensions settlement. However, he added: \u201cIt became clear that SPG/Taveta [Green\u2019s investment company] and tPR [the Pensions Regulator] were entrenched and little could be done by RAL/BHS whilst that position remained.\u201d Chappell said that when the Pensions Regulator launched a formal investigation into BHS after Green sold the business it reduced the possibility of securing emergency funding \u201csubstantially\u201d. He said that Retail Acquisitions \u201cdid not fully appreciate the severity of the detrimental effect\u201d from the investigation. On credit insurance, which offers financial protection to suppliers when selling their goods to a retailer, he added: \u201cRAL was promised assistance by SPG/Taveta/Arcadia in procuring trade credit insurance. \u201cA guarantee by Arcadia would have meant that BHS would be creditworthy and suppliers would be able to supply goods to it without demanding payment in advance for goods. Without trade credit insurance, no substantial retail business can survive.\u201d A spokesman for Green and Arcadia said they had no plans to make a statement about the MPs\u2019 debate and Chappell\u2019s comments.",

      "bodyText": "Sky has said it will shortly start registering interest from customers wanting to join its upcoming Sky Mobile service, as it prepares to take on BT and operators such as Vodafone in the \u00a315bn UK mobile market. In January 2015, the company reached a deal with O2 to launch a mobile offering, expanding its business from TV, broadband and home phones. It will begin registering potential customers from 31 October. Stephen van Rooyen, the chief executive of Sky UK and Ireland, said: \u201cWe have long had eyes on the size of the prize. With \u00a315bn in revenues, it is our largest adjacent sector for us. The opportunity to enter and take share is substantial. There are literally millions of customers for us to go after.\u201d Earlier this year, BT, which started taking on Sky\u2019s pay TV dominance in 2012 by spending billions on sports television rights, including the Premier League, paid \u00a312bn to buy EE and return to the mobile market. Sky Mobile is expected to focus on getting its 12m existing subscribers to take up the mobile service. \u201cFrom a huge amount of research, we know that two-thirds of our customers, after being shown our proposition, would consider switching to Sky,\u201d van Rooyen said. \u201cCombined with our track record of selling more to our customers, mobile is an opportunity of real scale.\u201d Mobile is a key market for additional revenue and profit growth for Sky, which along with BT paid more than \u00a35bn for Premier League rights last year, a 70% increase on the previous deal. Sky will be hoping to emulate the success of its move into broadband, which has seen the company attract more than 6m customers since 2006, second only to BT. Van Rooyen said the mobile service was being launched with a \u201climited and controlled capital investment\u201d. Under the deal with O2, he added, Sky retains the \u201cflexibility to switch to an alternative network provider, which ensures our economics remain competitive over time\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Santa Claus is back, but not quite as we may remember him. Relaxing in a hot tub filled with coloured \u201cbaubles\u201d and strutting his stuff under a spinning disco ball at the office party, he returns this year to feature in 12 of the 16 Christmas windows in Selfridges\u2019 flagship branch on Oxford Street \u2013 London\u2019s busiest shopping street \u2013 which are unveiled on Thursday. Launching its festive windows and in-store decorations \u2013 which include cannons firing confetti and glitzy giant baubles as well as an expanded standalone \u201cChristmas shop\u201d \u2013 the retailer cannot be accused of understatement. Every smiling full-size mannequin wears a custom-made Santa suit featuring 6,000 large red sequins (manufactured in Hong Kong) and handstitched by a team of six people in Bali. Also for the windows, Selfridges\u2019 in-house creative team has sourced specialist ski equipment \u2013 including a vintage skidoo \u2013 from a reclamation yard in the French Alps to create this year\u2019s much-anticipated Christmas theme. Each window showcases a snowy Alpine landscape and different party scenarios, where family, friends, pets (from poodles to bambis to giant Polar bears) \u2013 and even a snogging couple at the office party \u2013 all join in the fun. \u201cWe thought it was time to bring Santa back as he is a traditional favourite,\u201d said Hannah Emslie, the head of creative presentation and visual merchandising at Selfridges. \u201cHowever, we wanted to do something with a twist. Although the theme is called Shine On, we like to think it\u2019s Alpine rave meets Palm Springs. We\u2019ve had a lot of fun with fashion and retro features with a hint of America. We hope it will bring a smile to shoppers\u2019 faces.\u201d The last time Santa was the central theme \u2013 appearing in each window \u2013 was in 2009, when the displays were hailed \u201cthe more the merrier\u201d. One of many high-end London retailers whose takings have been boosted by the influx of international tourists taking advantage of the slump in the pound, Selfridges hopes the tills will continue to ring as the shoppers pour in over the festive season. The sudden currency depreciation triggered by the result of the June referendum vote has left sterling hovering at its lowest level against the dollar for more than 30 years. This has turned the UK into a relatively cheaper destination for millions of foreign travellers wanting to shop for luxury goods. Late last night, the in-store creative team pulled back the vinyl on Oxford Street \u2013 as some windows were still being completed at the 11th hour \u2013 to the bemusement of passersby. A full-sized silver glitter-encrusted ski gondola \u2013 which had been 3D-printed \u2013 was wheeled into in a front window, awaiting Santa and his ski chums. Nearby, an enormous \u201cfaux\u201d fir panel of foliage was carried by a JCB on to the pavement and winched into place by a team of contractors in hi-vis waistcoats. The materials in the backdrops of the windows \u2013 which have a pink and blue colour scheme \u2013 range from glittered acrylics, iridescent snow, gold lam\u00e9, pastel sheepskins and super-soft velvets. The theme was agreed more than a year ago as the process of producing the Christmas displays and windows \u2013 from initial ideas to sign-off and final reveal \u2013 can take up to 15 months to complete. Selfridges\u2019 dedicated Christmas shop \u2013 selling decorations and stationery \u2013 launched in August, but will double in size when it opens fully on Thursday. The sparkling theme \u2013 also echoed in its Manchester and Birmingham stores \u2013 involves 114,000 Christmas baubles strung from balconies and ceilings and more than two tonnes of glitter. Inside the central atrium, 10 giant coloured disco balls \u2013 ranging from 1.5 metres to 1.7 metres in diameter and the largest it has ever used \u2013 will rotate and move and up and down, thanks to more than 100 metres of electric cabling. For the first time the store will set off confetti cannons every day, which will release 64,000 bits of paper on to surprised shoppers. In addition, a whopping 3,000 metres of iridescent film will be used, 1,800 star decorations across the London store and 1,500 metres of garland on escalator handrails. The biggest triple-sided window at the corner of Oxford Street and Orchard Street features a giant silver chrome party popper with a specially commissioned multicoloured neon installation instead of confetti. Selfridges\u2019 Christmas installation \u2013 slightly earlier than last year but still before the switching on of the Oxford and Regent Street Christmas lights on 1 November \u2013 will be in place for \u201c65 days plus\u201d \u2013 up to and probably beyond the start of the traditional Boxing Day sale. Harvey Nichols is due to unveil its Christmas windows in early November followed by John Lewis, which will again link the theme to its hotly anticipated Christmas advertisement. Despite ferocious competition in the retail sector there is a \u201cfriendly rivalry\u201d over the Christmas \u201creveal\u201d, Emslie said. \u201cWe certainly like to see what everyone is doing. Last year there seemed to be a bit of a zodiac and space theme going on,\u201d she said. \u201cChristmas is absolutely huge for us in commercial terms. It has always been a big endeavour for Selfridges as the founder, Harry Gordon Selfridge, was American and he personally introduced the traditions of the US-style celebration of Christmas in retail terms to the UK.\u201d",

Also for the windows, Selfridges\u2019 in-house creative team has sourced specialist ski equipment \u2013 including a vintage skidoo \u2013 from a reclamation yard in the French Alps to create this year\u2019s much-anticipated Christmas theme. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2afc9e40852f7491bce20b3a09c969b7a157a07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2afc9e40852f7491bce20b3a09c969b7a157a07/0_146_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Santa double act!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Santa double act.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each window showcases a snowy Alpine landscape and different party scenarios, where family, friends, pets (from poodles to bambis to giant Polar bears) \u2013 and even a snogging couple at the office party \u2013 all join in the fun. </p> <p>\u201cWe thought it was time to bring Santa back as he is a traditional favourite,\u201d said Hannah Emslie, the head of creative presentation and visual merchandising at Selfridges. \u201cHowever, we wanted to do something with a twist. Although the theme is called Shine On, we like to think it\u2019s Alpine rave meets Palm Springs. We\u2019ve had a lot of fun with fashion and retro features with a hint of America. We hope it will bring a smile to shoppers\u2019 faces.\u201d<br></p> <p>The last time Santa was the central theme \u2013 appearing in each window \u2013 was in 2009, when the displays were hailed \u201cthe more the merrier\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3540cd951ea2b0a2175a48dbd8ddc11bd85e82bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3540cd951ea2b0a2175a48dbd8ddc11bd85e82bc/0_148_2404_3004/800.jpg\" alt=\"Selfridges Christmas windows unveiled, London, UK\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chilling out with a polar bear.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of many high-end London retailers whose takings have been boosted by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/tourism-booms-in-uk-after-post-referendum-fall-in-pound\">influx of international tourists </a> taking advantage of the slump in the pound, Selfridges hopes the tills will continue to ring as the shoppers pour in over the festive season. The sudden currency depreciation triggered by the result of the June referendum vote has left sterling hovering at its lowest level against the dollar for more than 30 years. This has turned the UK into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/23/spending-by-visitors-to-uk-tourism-rose-2-per-cent-in-july\">relatively cheaper destination</a> for millions of foreign travellers wanting to shop for luxury goods. <br></p> <p>Late last night, the in-store creative team pulled back the vinyl on Oxford Street \u2013 as some windows were still being completed at the 11th hour \u2013 to the bemusement of passersby. A full-sized silver glitter-encrusted ski gondola \u2013 which had been 3D-printed \u2013 was wheeled into in a front window, awaiting Santa and his ski chums. Nearby, an enormous \u201cfaux\u201d fir panel of foliage was carried by a JCB on to the pavement and winched into place by a team of contractors in hi-vis waistcoats.<br></p> <p>The materials in the backdrops of the windows \u2013 which have a pink and blue colour scheme \u2013 range from glittered acrylics, iridescent snow, gold lam\u00e9, pastel sheepskins and super-soft velvets. The theme was agreed more than a year ago as the process of producing the Christmas displays and windows \u2013 from initial ideas to sign-off and final reveal \u2013 can take up to 15 months to complete.<br></p> <p>Selfridges\u2019 dedicated Christmas shop \u2013 selling decorations and stationery \u2013 launched in August, but will double in size when it opens fully on Thursday. The sparkling theme \u2013 also echoed in its Manchester and Birmingham stores \u2013 involves 114,000 Christmas baubles strung from balconies and ceilings and more than two tonnes of glitter.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"96ff2c875fd24bc7b019746234d29911c7dc05ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96ff2c875fd24bc7b019746234d29911c7dc05ef/0_112_3600_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Selfridges Christmas windows unveiled, London, UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Santa at the office party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Inside the central atrium, 10 giant coloured disco balls \u2013 ranging from 1.5 metres to 1.7 metres in diameter and the largest it has ever used \u2013 will rotate and move and up and down, thanks to more than 100 metres of electric cabling.

      "bodyText": "Three former Tesco executives accused of fraud in relation to an accounting scandal at Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket will go on trial next September. Christopher Bush, the former managing director of Tesco UK, Carl Rogberg, the former finance director of Tesco UK, and John Scouler, the former commercial director for food, appeared at Southwark crown court for a plea and case management hearing on Thursday, when the date for the full trial was set for 4 September 2017. They are all charged with one count of fraud by abuse of position and one count of false accounting. The three men could face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of the fraud charge and seven years for false accounting. Their lawyers have said they intended to plead not guilty to the charges. The allegations relate to a scandal at Tesco that left a \u00a3326m hole in its accounts. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) launched a criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco in October 2014, after the company admitted that it had overstated profits by \u00a3263m by incorrectly booking payments from suppliers. It later revised the overstatement up to \u00a3326m. At the previous hearing last month at Westminster magistrates\u2019 court, the three men were accused of abusing their positions as senior employees of the supermarket chain for personal gain. The prosecution accused them of dishonestly falsifying Tesco\u2019s digital accounting records and its draft interim accounts by the \u201cinputting of and/or reliance upon commercial income figures which gave a false account of the financial position of Tesco\u201d. The SFO investigation into Tesco is continuing and it is possible that more individuals and the company itself could face action. However, it is understood that the former chief executive Philip Clarke, who was questioned under caution by the SFO, will not be charged. When the SFO announced it had charged the executives last month, Tesco said it continued to cooperate with the investigation. The company said: \u201cThe last two years have seen an extensive programme of change at Tesco, but given this is an ongoing legal matter, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time.\u201d Bush, Rogberg and Scouler will return to court on 30 May next year for a preliminary hearing. All three were released on unconditional bail.",

      "bodyText": "Retail sales were weaker than expected in September as shoppers were put off by higher clothing prices and exceptionally warm weather. Sales on UK high streets were flat for a second consecutive month, according to the Office for National Statistics, which also revised up its initial estimate of a 0.2% drop in August. Economists had expected sales to rise by 0.4% last month. Despite the weaker-than-expected performance, Kate Davies, a senior statistician at the ONS, said the broader backdrop for retail sales was positive following the vote to leave the European Union on 23 June. \u201cRetail sales in September 2016 were unchanged from August 2016. However, the underlying trend is one of strength, suggesting consumer confidence has remained steady since June\u2019s referendum,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was some variation between store types, clothing stores saw a fall in the quantity bought in part due to rising prices and a warmer than average September.\u201d In the third quarter, retail sales grew at the fastest rate in almost two years, up 1.8% compared with the second. It was the strongest three-month performance since the final quarter of 2014. Economists said the figures suggested the retail sector made a positive contribution to economic growth in the third quarter, boosting hopes there was no sharp slowdown following 0.7% growth in the second quarter. The ONS will publish the first estimate of third-quarter growth on 27 October. Looking further ahead Martin Beck, from the forecasting group EY Item Club, said strength in the third quarter could represent a \u201clast hurrah\u201d for the high street, as customers face the prospect of higher prices triggered by the drop in the pound since the Brexit vote. \u201cInflation is now likely to pick up sharply, as the impact of the depreciation in the value of sterling steadily passes through to consumer prices,\u201d he said. \u201cThe degree to which retailers pass on rising import costs remains to be seen, but there is certainly a sense that the strong third-quarter figures for retail sales volumes are likely to represent a last hurrah for the high street, with a more challenging period to come for retailers and consumers alike.\u201d In September, clothing sales fell by 2.8%, following a 3% drop in August. Food sales fell 0.2%, while sales of household goods and those at department stores rose. The annual rate of sales growth slowed to 4.1% last month from 6.6% in August. Consumer finances are expected to come under greater pressure in the coming months, as inflation rises and firms delay hiring decisions and limit wage rises amid uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. Capital Economics predicts household spending will slow to about 1.5% in 2017 from 2.7% this year. Ruth Gregory, the UK economist at the consultancy, said some of the negative effects for consumers would be offset by low interest rates and an easing of fiscal austerity that is widely expected when Philip Hammond delivers his maiden autumn statement on 23 November.",

      "bodyText": "There have been some hefty falls in the mid-cap index following some badly received updates. Cyber security and risk mitigation company NCC has plunged 34% to 227.7p after it reported 21% growth in the first four months of the year but said three large contracts had been cancelled, one in the Netherlands had been deferred and it faced difficulties with the renewal of some managed services contracts. It said it was too early to quantify the impact on the current year, but growth would now be more biases towards the second half than it had expected. Canaccord Genuity said: We expect these issues will have a significant impact on first half margins but the company believes they can recover in the second half. We believe this will be challenging given the expectation of group margins improving this year. We expect consensus estimates for the full year to be cut by around 10% if only to be conservative and believe the downside could ultimately be greater if recovery is not achieved. A decrease in earnings estimates combined with a de-rating could have a material impact on the stock. Meanwhile Keller is down 26% at 652.5p after the engineering group said its full year results would be 15% below expectations, mainly due to difficult trading in Asia. It will also take a \u00a310m hit in the second half for further restructuring. Numis said: Whilst management have made some positive noises in regards to outlook, this is the second profit warning in three months and therefore investors may be sceptical of management guidance. As a result, we retain our hold recommendation on a reduced target price of 720p. And Senior has slid 16% to 170.5p as it warned annual profits would be below expectations due to lower demand for parts used in both the oil and gas markets as well as production of heavy trucks. Liberum said: Weakness was across the division in Flexonics, with particular weakness in North American Heavy Trucks. We have been cautious on this for some time, while the company cites Flexonics as the main cause of the downgrade, we are also concerned about ramp-up risks in the civil aero cycle, with the company acknowledging that this was slower than anticipated in the third quarter. The three companies are currently the three biggest fallers in the FTSE 250 following their various warnings.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green has launched a fresh attack on the chair of the work and pensions committee for criticising him, ahead of a Commons debate on whether to strip the retailer of his knighthood. A letter from Green\u2019s family holding company, Taveta Investments, accuses Frank Field of \u201chighly defamatory and false statements\u201d about the former BHS owner and his retail empire Arcadia, which includes Topshop and Dorothy Perkins. In particular, the letter (pdf) accuses Field of \u201ccausing distress\u201d to Arcadia staff by claiming that Green was \u201crunning the Arcadia group into the ground like BHS\u201d. It adds: \u201cThe allegations you are making are false and your behaviour unacceptable. Arcadia has 22,000 employees who do not deserve to be treated in this manner.\u201d Field co-led a parliamentary committee investigation into the demise of BHS earlier this year. The damning report by MPs concluded in July that BHS was subject to \u201csystematic plunder\u201d by its former owners Green and Dominic Chappell. Green sold BHS for \u00a31 in 2015 to a group of investors led by Chappell, a former racing driver who had previously been declared bankrupt three times. BHS went into administration in April, with a pension deficit of \u00a3571m and the loss of 11,000 jobs. Taveta\u2019s letter also objects to Field\u2019s lack of regret at having stated that Green had been \u201cnicking money off other people\u201d. It adds: \u201cBy making or repeating these statements, you have falsely alleged that Sir Philip is a thief. You know this is false and malicious.\u201d But Taveta said the billionaire would not take legal action against Field, despite him \u201cgoading Sir Philip and Arcadia to sue\u201d. The House of Commons is due to hold a debate on the MPs\u2019 report about the demise of BHS and whether to strip Green of his knighthood at about 11.30am. Green made a last-ditch attempt to save his knighthood on Tuesday, suggesting that he was close to agreeing a rescue deal for the BHS pension fund and saying he was \u201cvery, very, very sorry\u201d for the retailer\u2019s collapse. Field said on Wednesday that there was little to justify Green holding on to his knighthood. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe key thing was coming up with a generous pension settlement, but he\u2019s never done so.\u201d According to John Ralfe, an independent pensions expert, the Pensions Regulator is unlikely to find strong legal grounds to demand Sir Philip Green put more money into the BHS pension scheme.",

The German carrier lifted its full year earnings target after saying business bookings were better than expected in September, with analysts saying the statement was much better than anticipated. Deutsche Bank said: We expected a solid third quarter from Lufthansa but clearly this ad hoc statement is substantially better. Lufthansa shares have jumped 8%, and the positive news has seen British Airways owner International Airlines Group climb 3% to 405.4p, while easyJet has added 2% to 946.5p. A rise in profits at Heathrow has also helped sentiment, despite the UK government still vacillating on whether the airport should get a third runway. The recent strong oil price gain has helped push BP 0,3p higher to 490.45p while Royal Dutch Shell B shares have risen 15p to 2179.5p. Overall though the FTSE 100 has dipped 11.14 points to 7010.78 after the final US presidential debate and strong, but lower than expected UK retail sales. Investors remain cautious ahead of the latest monetary policy news from the European Central Bank. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said: A shock drop in US crude supplies midweek continues to underpin both the latest rally in oil prices and demand for risk assets. The third and last US presidential debate overnight also looked to give stockmarket favourite Hilary Clinton a clear path to the White House next month. Now, focus shifts to the ECB, and central bank president Mario Draghi who is widely tipped to sit on his hands in terms of action this meeting. Crucial will be comments made on future policy, and the discussion around tapering asset purchases to wean the sickly eurozone economy off of QE. But just as likely is a possible relaxation of rules governing what assets policymakers are currently allowed to buy. Nearing self-imposed limits, they may buy extra time for increasingly ineffective QE to work. A number of major companies have gone ex-dividend including BAE Systems, down 11.5p at 542p, and Smiths Group, 38p lower at \u00a314.42. Sky has fallen 14p to 842p as it unveiled more details of its mobile service, while rival broadcaster ITV is down 7.4p at 172.4p on worries about weaker advertising markets. The ITV fall comes despite buy notes from Jefferies, which set a 195p target and Liberum (albeit with a reduced price target from 360p to 350p). Liberum said: We cut our2016 net advertising estimate to -1.6% (from 1.1% previously) as we reflect the latest comments from media buyers into our forecasts, which suggest a weaker advertising momentum into the fourth quarter. We keep our 2017 net advertising estimates unchanged and reiterate ITV as our top buy in the sector. At 10 times 2016 PE the stock looks attractive.",

The world\u2019s largest mining firm will be presented on Thursday with a list of demands from representatives of the local community in Minas Gerais region, as well as from people affected by projects in Colombia and Indonesia. The Fundao dam owned by Samarco \u2013 a joint venture between BHP and the Brazilian firm Vale \u2013 collapsed on 5 November last year, releasing a deluge of mining waste that left at least 19 people dead, 700 others homeless, rivers polluted and homes destroyed. Protesters, including a Franciscan monk and a farmer from Minas Gerais, will stage a re-enactment of the disaster before presenting a list of demands calling on BHP to do more to make up for the damage. The demands include a call for BHP to expand its compensation scheme to cover families who were not originally included but were directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. Campaigners also want BHP to acknowledge responsibility for a miscarriage that would increase the death toll to 20. \u201cCurrently, the company decides who is and who is not affected, while denying the indirect costs of the disaster,\u201d said the London Mining Network, one of the campaign groups organising the protest. Protesters are to gather outside the firm\u2019s annual meeting at the QEII conference centre in London and will call on BHP to remove mud from the river Doce and cancel its plans to build another dam in the same area. They will also denounce the Renova Foundation, which was set up by Vale and BHP to co-ordinate damage repair. Protesters say the foundation lacks legitimacy because it does not involve local communities enough. \u201cWe have seen whole communities destroyed by BHP Billiton and Vale\u2019s operations,\u201d said Fra Rodrigo de Castro Am\u00e9d\u00e9e P\u00e9ret. \u201cThey have lost everything without receiving any real compensation.\u201d The protest will also include representatives of communities complaining about the impact of mining projects in Colombia and Indonesia. People who live near Colombia\u2019s Cerrej\u00f3n mine \u2013 which provides large amounts of the coal burned in the UK \u2013 say their lives have been blighted by noise and air pollution, as well as forced evictions and diversion of local water supplies. Colombian activist Luz \u00c1ngela Uriana Epiay\u00fa said: \u201cI remember Cerrej\u00f3n [owed by BHP Billiton] came to La Guajira promising the world, but they never actually sat down and spoke to us. \u201cNow, at night, we barely sleep.

These are the consequences we face for having the Cerrej\u00f3n mine for a neighbour.\u201d Arie Rompas, of Friends of the Earth in Indonesia, has travelled to London to highlight BHP\u2019s recent sale of the IndoMet coal project in the country\u2019s Central Kalimantan region. He claims BHP has avoided responsibility for a waste spill and further damage caused by the mine by selling its 75% stake in the project. \u201cBHP paid criminally low compensation for the lands they have taken and now they are polluting our rivers and attempting to walk away from the mess they have made.
