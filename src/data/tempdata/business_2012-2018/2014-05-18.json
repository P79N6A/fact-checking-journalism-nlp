      "bodyText": "Telecoms company AT&amp;T has announced a deal to take over DirecTV, the US's largest satellite broadcaster in the latest in a series of media and telecoms deals that have rattled consumer groups and attracted regulatory scrutiny. AT&amp;T, the second-largest wireless provider, confirmed on Sunday that it is paying $49bn to takeover DirecTV in a deal that will makes it a major player in the pay-TV business. With more than 20 million subscribers in the US and 18 million more in Latin America, DirecTV is the second-largest pay-TV provider behind Comcast, which is currently negotiating the takeover of its second biggest cable rival, Time Warner Cable (TWC). Should the two deals be approved, the telecoms, television and internet accounts of 56m Americans will be controlled by just two companies. AT&amp;T's merger with DirecTV would create a company with 26m pay-TV subscribers compared to 30m at Comcast and TWC, if regulators approve their deal. A deal with AT&amp;T would give DirecTV the ability to package phone and internet service the way cable companies do. AT&amp;T already runs a television service, U-Verse, but with 5.7 million customers it is tiny in comparison to DirecTV. Randall Stephenson, AT&amp;T chairman and CEO, said he was also attracted to the deal by DirecTV's strong presence in Latin America. Stephenson said: \"This is a unique opportunity that will redefine the video entertainment industry and create a company able to offer new bundles and deliver content to consumers across multiple screens \u2013 mobile devices, TVs, laptops, cars and even airplanes.\" \"This compelling and complementary combination will bring significant benefits to all consumers, shareholders and DirecTV employees,\" said Mike White, president and CEO of DirecTV. The deal is bound to spark regulatory scrutiny. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is already examining Comcast and TWC's proposed merger, which has sparked widespread protests from consumer groups concerned about further loss of competition in an already consolidated industry. Craig Aaron, president of the open-internet advocacy group Free Press, said: \"The captains of our communications industry have clearly run out of ideas. Instead of innovating and investing in their networks, companies like AT&amp;T and Comcast are simply buying up the competition. These takeovers are expensive, and consumers end up footing the bill for merger mania. \"For the amount of money and debt AT&amp;T and Comcast are collectively shelling out for their respective mega-deals, they could deploy super-fast gigabit fibre broadband service to every single home in America. This is not about providing better services or even connecting more Americans. It's about eliminating the last shred of competition in a communications sector that's already dominated by too few players.\" AT&amp;T has been looking for deals since a $39bn takeover of T-Mobile was blocked in 2011, on the grounds it would overly concentrate the wireless industry. The company had been expected to make a bid for the UK's Vodafone but appears to have shifted its focus after the announcement of the Comcast/TWC deal. In March Stephenson called that merger an \"industry-redefining deal\" and said AT&amp;T would react by concentrating investment in its high-speed cable delivery services. There was also some skepticism on the deal from Wall Street. Writing before Sunday's news Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson Research, wrote: \"Like any merger born of necessity rather than opportunity, the combination of AT&amp;T and DirecTV calls to mind images of lifeboats and rescues at sea.\" AT&amp;T will pay $95 per share for DirecTV, with about $66.50 coming in the form of its own shares and $28.50 in cash. On Friday DirecTV's shares finished trading at $86.18.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "House prices are rising at their fastest rate in more than six years and have climbed 8.9% year on year, adding to worries about the property boom as the Bank of England governor became the latest senior figure to express concern. Mark Carney warned on Sunday that the housing market posed the biggest risk to Britain's economic recovery as a shortage of new homes drives up prices. Property website Rightmove said the average asking price is nearly 9% higher than a year ago, rising to a new record of \u00a3272,003 in May \u2013 the highest annual increase since October 2007. Prices in London rose more than 16% over the same period, as Rightmove said the market in the capital was \"frothy\". Miles Shipside, Rightmove's housing market analyst, said a shortage of housing was underpinning prices in London. \"For a bubble to burst you need a sustained drop in demand, yet agents in the capital report a consistently high level of would-be buyers in markets that are not yet out of reach for Londoners,\" he said. \"So while you might describe London's annual jump of over 16% as being as a result of a very frothy market, it is underpinned by long-term demand and a genuine shortage of housing supply. \"The northern regions are still below their previous peaks, and while all four southern regions are at all-time highs, the average annual rise outside London remains below 5%.\" However, Carney highlighted the housing market as the main threat to the economic recovery. Speaking on Sky News' Murnaghan programme, he said the Bank of England was watching to ensure that banks had enough reserves to withstand the risks of bad loans should the housing market suffer a downturn. It was also checking lending procedures to try to ensure that mortgages were only issued to people who could afford them. \"By reinforcing both of those we can reduce the risk that comes from a housing market that has deep, deep structural problems,\" he said. Nevertheless, he said there was evidence that large-value mortgages \u2013 with loans of more than four times a borrower's salary \u2013 were on the rise again. The Bank has the power to issue recommendations on the scale of loan-to-value ratios. \"The biggest risk to financial stability, and therefore to the durability of the expansion \u2013 those risks centre in the housing market, and that's why we are focused on that,\" he said. \"We don't want to build up another big debt overhang that is going to hurt individuals and is very much going to slow the economy in the medium term. \"We would be concerned if there were a rapid increase in high loan-to-value mortgages across the banks \u2026 we have seen that creeping up and it is something we are watching closely.\" He added: \"The level of higher loan-to-income mortgages, ones above four and a half, five times loan-to-income, potentially could store up bigger problems for the future and we need to be careful.\" Carney said the central bank was unable to solve the shortage of new houses. At 123,000 units per year, housebuilding remains well below the 200,000 many economists consider to be the minimum needed. \"We're not going to build a single house at the Bank of England and we can't influence that,\" Carney said. He said the rate of homebuilding was half that in his own country, Canada, despite the UK having a population twice the size. His comments received encouragement from deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who for the first time said the government should curb its Help to Buy mortgage subsidy scheme if the Bank recommends doing so. Clegg told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1: \"I think if [Carney] says we need to pare back some of the government schemes like Help to Buy, then I think we should do so. He's certainly right when he says the big long-term problem is we simply don't build enough homes in this country, we haven't done so for years, we're making progress now but we need to do much more in the future.\" David Cameron also responded on the Murnaghan programme to Carney's comments by saying he was well aware of the need for more new homes, which was why he had simplified the planning process in favour of developers. He said that as a result there was more new homebuilding than at any time since the recession. \"We have given the Bank of England the duty to make sure that bubbles are dealt with in the economy. They have all the powers they need to do that,\" he said. He acknowledged, however, that more homes are needed to be built in order to satisfy demand. \"[Carney] is absolutely right when he says fundamentally we need to build more houses in Britain,\" he said. A housebuilding industry representative said Help to Buy was addressing Carney's concerns. Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation, said: \"We have an acute shortage of housing that has developed over decades and is going to take time to address. After years of the lowest rate on record, housebuilding is now increasing very rapidly.\" He credited the government's Help to Buy equity loan scheme, which has given a boost to housebuilding and allowed the industry to plan ahead. Carney made the headlines last week when he played down demands for an early interest rate rise. Some economists have called on the bank to raise rates to cool the housing market and temper economic growth, which is running at more than 3%. The Bank of England has already begun a review of the Treasury's Help to Buy scheme at the request of the chancellor, George Osborne. Osborne, who is equally concerned to stall an unstable house boom, wants the Bank to see whether the scheme, which underwrites mortgage deposits mainly for first-time buyers, is encouraging people to take on unaffordable homes. Nigel Lawson, a former chancellor during Margaret Thatcher's time as prime minister, said Carney had been given the responsibility to advise the government over the scheme and should stop \"bleating about it\" and make a decision. He added he would like to see Help to Buy phased back or brought to an end, plus a 0.25% rise in the official interest rate before the end of 2014. The Tory peer, now known as Lord Lawson of Blaby, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: \"I think [Carney] is absolutely right to express his concern but George Osborne has very sensibly charged the Bank of England with the responsibility of telling him when Help to Buy should be either phased back or ended altogether. So really the ball is in Mark Carney's and the Bank of England's court, and the question is if he is advising the chancellor that the time has come \u2013 and I think it has myself \u2013 to scale it back or indeed end it altogether, and if not why not. \"He's not just a commentator like you or I. He has a responsibility to discharge and the question is, is he doing that?\" Lawson said he was sure the government would accept the advice if Carney called for the scheme to be scaled back or ended. He said: \"They wouldn't argue. They would accept it. That's the reason why they asked him to advise them so it's up to him to decide is he going to do it or not. \"I think just sort of bleating about it, however well justified his views are, is not really what he should be doing.\"",

      "standfirst": "Commodities trader Dan Gertler made $67m in deals conducted with Glencore in the impoverished African country, report alleges", 
      "body": "<p>GlencoreXstrata, the world's largest commodities trader, enriched a friend of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's president by tens of millions of dollars while also giving him loans in excess of $500m (\u00a3298m), a report has claimed.</p> <p>Dan Gertler, a friend of the DRC president Joseph Kabila, made $67m in deals conducted with Glencore in the impoverished African country, when the Israeli billionaire and the London-listed commodity trader took over one of Congo's biggest copper producers. He also borrowed $568m from Glencore in order to participate in a series of deals between 2007 and 2010.</p> <p>The report, produced by the campaign group Global Witness, says Gertler's profits in cash and shares were channelled through offshore firms.</p> <p>The claims about the scale of Gertler's business dealings in Congo come as Glencore prepares to host its annual general meeting in Zug, Switzerland, on Tuesday, when campaigners are expected to raise questions about the Gertler links.</p> <p>Glencore is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/15/new-glencore-chief-tony-hayward-opposed\" title=\"\">already preparing for a rough ride at the meeting</a> over its decision to appoint the former BP boss Tony Hayward as its new chairman, promoting him from the role of interim chairman, instead of a figure from outside the business.</p> <p>Leigh Baldwin of Global Witness, said: \"Glencore appears to have knowingly entered loss-making deals with the president's friend, a man who is central to all its investments in Congo. The corruption risks here are obvious. Glencore should face up to them and commission an independent and detailed investigation into its Congo deals.\"</p> <p>Last year, Kofi Annan's Africa Progress Panel singled out Glencore and the then London-listed Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation when it claimed the DRC had incurred losses of $1.36bn between 2010 and 2012 as a result of the alleged undervaluation of state assets.</p> <p>But despite numerous reports into Gertler's DRC business dealings, no evidence of wrongdoing has been published.

      "bodyText": "GlencoreXstrata, the world's largest commodities trader, enriched a friend of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's president by tens of millions of dollars while also giving him loans in excess of $500m (\u00a3298m), a report has claimed. Dan Gertler, a friend of the DRC president Joseph Kabila, made $67m in deals conducted with Glencore in the impoverished African country, when the Israeli billionaire and the London-listed commodity trader took over one of Congo's biggest copper producers. He also borrowed $568m from Glencore in order to participate in a series of deals between 2007 and 2010. The report, produced by the campaign group Global Witness, says Gertler's profits in cash and shares were channelled through offshore firms. The claims about the scale of Gertler's business dealings in Congo come as Glencore prepares to host its annual general meeting in Zug, Switzerland, on Tuesday, when campaigners are expected to raise questions about the Gertler links. Glencore is already preparing for a rough ride at the meeting over its decision to appoint the former BP boss Tony Hayward as its new chairman, promoting him from the role of interim chairman, instead of a figure from outside the business. Leigh Baldwin of Global Witness, said: \"Glencore appears to have knowingly entered loss-making deals with the president's friend, a man who is central to all its investments in Congo. The corruption risks here are obvious. Glencore should face up to them and commission an independent and detailed investigation into its Congo deals.\" Last year, Kofi Annan's Africa Progress Panel singled out Glencore and the then London-listed Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation when it claimed the DRC had incurred losses of $1.36bn between 2010 and 2012 as a result of the alleged undervaluation of state assets. But despite numerous reports into Gertler's DRC business dealings, no evidence of wrongdoing has been published. Both Glencore and Gertler deny any corruption risk, or that Gertler received preferential terms in his dealings with Glencore, which centred around two companies called Nikanor and Katanga Mining that owned substantial copper concessions in the country. A spokesman for Glencore said: \"All the transactions Glencore has concluded with companies associated with Mr Gertler have been conducted on arm's length terms and all public disclosure requirements applicable to us have been complied with. \"Glencore has not afforded companies associated with Mr Gertler preference over other shareholders in Nikanor or Katanga Mining. These transactions were entirely proper\". A spokesman for Gertler's Fleurette Group added: \"Fleurette has a long track record of investing in the DRC and has worked with a number of commercial partners \u2026 Loans made to Fleurette by Glencore to purchase shares in Katanga over five years ago have been fully disclosed \u2026 Our investment in Katanga shares has not resulted in any profit for Fleurette. \"Based on our average investment share price, our shares are today worth about $400m less than what we paid for them. We are long term investors and remain committed to the project, which we hope in time will deliver jobs and revenue for the people of the DRC.\" Global Witness says that in October 2009 and February 2010, Glencore sold Gertler 157m shares in Katanga Mining for $52m \u2013 via share options at a previously agreed price. In March 2010, Gertler sold 100m Katanga Mining shares back to Glencore for $76m, implying he immediately banked a cash profit of $24m, while keeping 57m shares that were worth $43m. Katanga shares have almost halved in value since.",

      "bodyText": "BT is hiring 1,600 engineers amid criticism from regulators over the speed at which new internet connections are installed and faults are repaired. The telecoms company, whose network is also relied on by dozens of other broadband providers including Sky and TalkTalk, has been rapped by watchdogs for leaving customers stranded without web access for too long. Watchdog Ofcom will on Tuesday publish its final decision on tough new sanctions designed to ensure BT repairs faults within two working days and installs new lines within 12 working days. \"One customer being out of service for too long is one too many,\" said Joe Garner, chief executive of Openreach, which builds and maintains BT's network. \"Millions of customers depend on broadband and they rely on us to keep them connected, whatever the weather.\" Garner said the new recruits would be a \"welcome boost\" to an engineering workforce that completes hundreds of thousands of jobs \u2013 such as installing fibre optic lines \u2013 each week. Garner promised that by the summer, BT would publish regular information on its service performance. The only information available to the public, on the website of the Office of the Telecoms Adjudicator, is often difficult to understand.Garner has promised to be better at maintaining Openreach's vast network, which reaches almost all of the UK's 28 million premises, for example by rewiring ageing telegraph poles before faults occur. However, he said Openreach will not be setting up a call centre to deal with customer complaints. Those with a broadband problem will have to deal with whoever bills them for broadband, whether that be BT's own retail arm or another company. Openreach employs more people than the Navy, with 31,600 staff. As the company has been ramping up the roll out of its fibre-optic network, numbers have grown by 1,200 in the last year. Many recruits will be drawn from the armed forces, with Garner emphasising there will be jobs for wounded personnel. He also wants more female engineers \u2013 less than 10% of Openreach staff are women. \"There's no reason why that can't change,\" said Garner. We'll be a better organisation if we better reflect the society we are part of, why would we not be fishing in half the labour pool? BT's service has in the past been hampered by bad weather, particularly when rain floods its ducts and manholes. During 2012, the wettest year on record, the time it took to install the some fibre lines fell to 18 days on average. During 2011, repairs slowed to an average of six days. Installations have picked up and are now within target, but TalkTalk says a third of faults reported by its customers are not fixed on time. Ofcom is expected to propose that by the financial year beginning April 2016, targets will have to be met 80% of the time. If they are not, BT could be fined. An Ofcom spokesperson said: \"We have been concerned about how long Openreach is taking to complete both repairs and installations. That is why we have proposed new targets which Openreach must meet in future, or else face the possibility of fines.\" Reader complaints to the Guardian have highlighted that newly build properties can take up to six months to connect. Garner said he was recruiting managers to ensure better communications with developers, so that BT worked more in tandem with building projects. \"Newbuilds is a hotspot,\" admitted Garner. \"We are putting a lot of focus on it its going to take us a bit longer to get on top of that. What I put top of the list is making sure if someone is out of service they are back in service quickly.\"",

    "webTitle": "Pfizer raises stakes with final AstraZeneca takeover approach", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "US drugsmaker Pfizer has raised the stakes in its much-contested quest to buy British rival AstraZeneca by lodging a fresh \u00a369bn takeover approach. The new proposal of \u00a355 a share piles pressure on AstraZeneca's board to enter negotiations to create the world's largest pharmaceutical company in the face of considerable opposition from politicians and Britain's scientific community. In a bid to force AstraZeneca to accept what would be the biggest foreign takeover of a British company, Pfizer said the improved offer is \"final and cannot be increased\". It added that it will not make a hostile offer directly to AstraZeneca shareholders and will only proceed with an offer with the recommendation of the AstraZeneca board. Pfizer boss Ian Read, who addressed political concerns over the mooted takeover in two parliamentary appearances last week, said: \"We believe our proposal is compelling for AstraZeneca's shareholders and that a Pfizer-AstraZeneca combination is in the best interests of all stakeholders. We are excited at the opportunity to create a scientific powerhouse, delivering great benefits to patients and science in the UK and across the globe. We stand by our unprecedented commitments to the UK government.\" In an attempt to persuade AstraZeneca investors to force the board to negotiate, he flagged the company's apparently implacable opposition to a deal. He said he did not believe the \"AstraZeneca board is currently prepared to recommend a deal at a reasonable price. We remain ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue but time for constructive engagement is running out.\" The New York-based Viagra maker raised its cash and shares proposal by 15% to \u00a355 a share, from \u00a350 a share at the beginning of the month. It raised the cash element of the approach \u2013 viewed as a significant factor in whether the deal will go through \u2013 to 45% from 33%, with the rest payable in Pfizer shares. AstraZeneca's shares ended last week trading at \u00a348.23. Pfizer has until 5pm 26 May to lodge a formal offer and meet a \"put up or shut up\" deadline imposed by the Takeover Panel, or walk away for six months. AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot told the Guardian last week that AstraZeneca's reputation could be damaged by Pfizer's tax avoidance plans, which will see Pfizer base the company in the UK in order to keep its cash pile from the US taxman. He also raised concerns about the proposed break-up of the business, which would see AstraZeneca's assets split between three new Pfizer divisions. In an emotional appeal at parliamentary hearings last week, Soriot said a deal could endanger lives by interrupting work on new cancer drugs. \"What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed \u2013 and essentially was delayed because in the meantime our two companies were involved in saving tax and saving costs?\" But he also acknowledged his duty to shareholders, saying the board would have to consider a credible bid. Pfizer wants to move its tax domicile to Britain to cut its tax bill, which has sparked controversy in Britain and among US lawmakers. The company has also worried British politicians and trade unions with the admission that it would cut global research and development spending and jobs. AstraZeneca has spent the last two weeks talking up its drug pipeline, in particular a new generation of cancer treatments that target the body's immune system. A tour of AstraZeneca shareholders by the Pfizer chief executive last week left the impression among City institutions that the US group is strongly committed to securing a takeover, a view confirmed by the renewed approach on Sunday night. Two of AstraZeneca's top ten shareholders, Sweden's Investor AB with a 4.1% stake and Aberdeen Asset Management with a 2.4% holding, had publicly backed the board's rejection of Pfizer's advances. The influential fund manager Neil Woodford, who controls a \u00a3350m stake in AstraZeneca on behalf of investment firm St James's Place, has also backed the firm's fight for independence, prior to the sweetened offer. But other big investors want it to start negotiations. Pfizer's Read is thought to have met a dozen institutional shareholders in AstraZeneca last week, including two hedge funds. Pfizer is under pressure from the UK government to extend from five years to 10 years its commitment to keep 20% of the combined research and development workforce in Britain. Meanwhile, British civil servants have begun exploratory talks with the EU over amending the terms of the public interest test to include continued investment in research and design as grounds on which the government could threaten to block the takeover. Vince Cable's business department is also interested in using the test to obtain stronger commitments from Pfizer on jobs and R&amp;D. The Labour party has also said it would subject any deal to an amended public interest test if it won the general election. Any takeover would be vetted on competition grounds by the European commission and regulatory authorities in the US and China, which competition lawyers say could take more than a year. AstraZeneca's chairman, Leif Johansson, has pointed to regulatory uncertainties, particularly in China. \"We identified a big execution risk,\" he told the Sunday Times. \"It could be over a year or more before the transaction happens.\" Sir Tom McKillop, who ran AstraZeneca from 1999 until 2006 and is a former president of the Science Council, became the latest senior industry figure to voice serious concerns about the takeover. Writing in the Sunday Times, he urged the firm's directors and shareholders to \"protect the 'soul' of this great business\". McKillop oversaw the 1999 merger between Sweden's Astra and Britain's Zeneca, which he described as a \"genuine merger of equals\" that \"allowed increased investment in R&amp;D, not the reduction that Pfizer proposes\". McKillop said Pfizer and AstraZeneca, by contrast, have \"different visions and conflicting cultures; it is unlikely that they will make a good fit together\". He concluded by telling AstraZeneca's directors that they must remember that their fiduciary duties extend not just to shareholders, but to the wider society \u2013 \"including the millions of patients hoping for new treatments that can only come from a commitment to research.\" The Swedish trade unions Unionen, Akademikerf\u00f6reningen and IF Metall, representing workers at AstraZenca's sites in Sweden, echoed concerns voiced by British unions Unite and GMB. They said: \"Pfizer's historical track record on mergers and acquisitions is quite scary. Takeover after takeover has been followed by redundancies and closures all over the world.\" It was also reported this weekend that the US drugstore chain Walgreens is reportedly preparing to take full control of Britain's biggest chemist, Alliance Boots, in a \u00a310.5bn deal. It is the latest attempt by a US company to redomicile to Britain to save billions in tax. Walgreens already owns 45% of Boots and has an option to buy the remaining 55% from next February with a six-month window.",

Patrick Gray, president of the Midcounties, said the purpose was not to axe the funding for the Co-op party \u2013 closely aligned to Labour \u2013 but to open the doors to campaign organisations with co-operative values. Two weeks ago, the Midcounties agreed to make a half-yearly donation to the Co-op party of \u00a324,000 and now expects the Co-op party to make applications to the campaigns fund in the future, the size of which is yet to be determined.

The funding of co-operatives to the Co-op party has been in focus because of the problems facing the Co-operative Group which has asked the public whether it should keeping making donations to the party. These donations in the past have totalled \u00a31m. The Group \u2013 in which independents such as the Midcounties have a 22% stake \u2013 is yet to disclose the outcome of that \"have your say survey\".

Prime minister David Cameron shops in the Midcounties store in Chipping Norton. \"At our annual meeting we agreed \u00a324,000 for six months. We anticipate [the Co-op party] asking for funding for the second six months,\" said Gray. The total sum in the new fund may be larger than the \u00a348,000 given to Co-op last year to enable the wider donations to be made, but was yet to be decided.

    "webTitle": "Pfizer expected to return with larger takeover bid for AstraZeneca", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca, Britain's second-largest pharmaceutical company, is braced for a renewed takeover offer from its US rival Pfizer as its fight to remain independent enters a critical seven days. Pfizer is widely expected to raise its cash and shares offer from \u00a350 a share to at least \u00a353, with a larger cash element, in an attempt to kickstart talks. This would value the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker at nearly \u00a367bn, compared with the 2 May proposal of \u00a363bn \u2013 of which less than a third was cash. Investors and analysts believe a new offer is imminent after a tour of AstraZeneca shareholders by Pfizer chief executive Ian Read last week left the impression among City institutions that the US group is strongly committed to securing a takeover. The New York-based Viagra maker has until 5pm next Monday to lodge a formal offer and meet a \"put up or shut up\" deadline imposed by the Takeover Panel, or walk away for six months. While a \u00a353 a share offer would increase the pressure on the AstraZeneca board to start talks, it could take a bid of \u00a355 a share to get a deal done, according to some analysts and shareholders. AstraZeneca's shares ended the week trading at \u00a348.23. AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot, who has so far refused to negotiate, said last week that the current offer was \"really far from what we think the value of the company is\". AstraZeneca has spent the last two weeks talking up its drug pipeline, in particular a new generation of cancer treatments that target the body's immune system. A hostile bid, which would see Pfizer bypass the board and appeal directly to AstraZeneca's shareholders, appears unlikely given the complexity of the proposed deal. Pfizer wants to move its tax domicile to Britain to cut its tax bill, which has sparked controversy in Britain and among US politicians. The company has also worried British politicians and trade unions with an admission that it would cut global research and development spending and jobs. Pfizer has declared its preference for a recommended offer and told AstraZeneca shareholders last week that talks with the board and access to the firm's books would help deliver \"optimal deal terms and structure\". Soriot told the Guardian last week that AstraZeneca's reputation could be damaged by Pfizer's tax avoidance plans and the proposed break-up of the business. AstraZeneca's assets would be split between Pfizer's three new divisions. But he also acknowledged his duty to shareholders, saying the board would have to consider a credible bid. Two of AstraZeneca's top 10 shareholders, Sweden's Investor AB, with a 4.1% stake, and Aberdeen Asset Management, with 2.4%, have publicly backed the board's rejection of Pfizer's advances. The influential fund manager Neil Woodford, whose new venture does not yet own shares in AstraZeneca, has also backed the Anglo-Swedish firm. But other big investors want it to start negotiations. Read is thought to have met a dozen institutional shareholders in AstraZeneca last week, including two hedge funds. Pfizer is under pressure from the UK government to extend from five years to 10 years its commitment to keep 20% of the combined research and development workforce in Britain. British civil servants have begun exploratory talks with the EU about amending the terms of the public interest test to include continued investment in research and design as grounds on which the government could threaten to block the takeover. Vince Cable's business department is also interested in using the test to obtain stronger commitments from Pfizer on jobs and R&amp;D. The Labour party has also said it would subject any deal to an amended public interest test if it won the general election. Any takeover would be vetted on competition grounds by the European commission and regulatory authorities in the US and China, which competition lawyers say could take more than a year. AstraZeneca's chairman, Leif Johansson, reiterated over the weekend that the price was too low and pointed to regulatory uncertainties, particularly in China. \"We identified a big execution risk,\" he told the Sunday Times. \"It could be over a year or more before the transaction happens.\" Sir Tom McKillop, who ran AstraZeneca from 1999 until 2006and is a former president of the Science Council, became the latest senior industry figure to voice serious concerns about the takeover. Writing in the Sunday Times, he urged the firm's directors and shareholders to \"protect the 'soul' of this great business\". McKillop oversaw the 1999 merger between Sweden's Astra and Britain's Zeneca, which he described as a \"genuine merger of equals\" that \"allowed increased investment in R&amp;D, not the reduction that Pfizer proposes\". McKillop said Pfizer and AstraZeneca, by contrast, had \"different visions and conflicting cultures; it is unlikely that they will make a good fit together\". He concluded by telling AstraZeneca's directors that they must remember that their fiduciary duties extend not just to shareholders, but to the wider society \u2013 \"including the millions of patients hoping for new treatments that can only come from a commitment to research.\" The Swedish trade unions Unionen, Akademikerf\u00f6reningen and IF Metall, representing workers at AstraZenca's sites in Sweden, echoed concerns voiced by British unions Unite and GMB. They said: \"Pfizer's historical track record on mergers and acquisitions is quite scary. Takeover after takeover has been followed by redundancies and closures all over the world.\" Meanwhile, the US drugstore chain Walgreens is reportedly preparing to take full control of Britain's biggest chemist, Alliance Boots, in a \u00a310.5bn deal. It is the latest attempt by a US company to redomicile to Britain to save billions in tax. Walgreens already owns 45% of Boots and has an option to buy the remaining 55% from next February with a six-month window.",

    "webTitle": "Standard Chartered under pressure over executive pay after investor revolt", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Standard Chartered is under pressure to back down on executive pay and overhaul its communications with shareholders, having suffered a rebellion at its annual general meeting. Investors said the bank failed to consult them properly about new bonuses for chief executive Peter Sands and other top managers. The botched communication led to a 41% vote against its pay policy. Leading shareholders said the vote should be a wake-up call for the board to listen to pension funds and other investors who own the business. After weathering the financial crisis, Standard Chartered was regarded as a star of the British banking industry. But after mis-steps including a profit warning and \u00a3415m in fines for breaching US sanctions against Iran, shareholders accuse it of complacency and not being alert to shifts in sentiment. A top 20 investor said: \"The profit warning and a string of negative surprises took the halo off the management team's aura of invincibility and opened it up to criticism, and I don't think they have handled it very well. They are surprised they had such a high vote against. We will wait and see what they do to improve.\" The shareholder revolt was aimed at bonuses linked to targets that could be hit in a single year. Investors and regulators want banks to pay top managers over a longer period in order to discourage short-term risky behaviour. A top 10 investor said there was disquiet over other matters such as the large number of executive directors on the board, chairman Sir John Peace's dual roles as chairman of Standard Chartered and fashion group Burberry, and the lack of independence of some non-executive directors. \"If you are making the decision to pay your directors at a certain level, you have got to go and engage with your shareholders. Their long-term problem is that if they don't start engaging with their shareholder base they are going to lose more support. They have to take a step back and ask: 'How should we go forward on this question of remuneration, what are shareholders' wider concerns and how are we going to address them?'\" Investors compared Standard Chartered's approach with that of HSBC. When HSBC realised investors were unhappy about a potential \u00a32.25m bonus for chairman Douglas Flint, it held talks with shareholders and staged a partial climbdown in an attempt to ward off a rebellion at this Friday's AGM. However, Standard Chartered failed to head off discontent before its AGM and came close to losing a binding vote on pay. A second top 10 shareholder said: \"The remuneration issue was really poorly conducted. Other banks like HSBC have handled the situation better.\" Another investor said: \"It was like they were making it up as they went along. They didn't communicate effectively or show any clear thinking behind their approach.\" Although the pay policy was passed, investors expect the bank to come back with revised proposals. Will Pomroy, policy lead at the National Association of Pension Funds, said: \"It is vitally important that companies engage with their shareholders. It is even more important that they subsequently both listen to and reflect upon the messages they hear. A significant response would be expected.\" Standard Chartered said: \"We actively solicit and react to all feedback from our shareholders, and hold an extensive programme of meetings between shareholders and a range of senior management. At the beginning of May we had already undertaken over 150 meetings among our top 25 shareholders, while in 2013 we had 270 meetings among the top 25.\"",

      "body": "<p>Standard Chartered is under pressure to back down on executive pay and overhaul its communications with shareholders, having suffered a rebellion at its annual general meeting.</p> <p>Investors said the bank failed to consult them properly about new bonuses for chief executive Peter Sands and other top managers. The botched communication led to a 41% vote against its pay policy.</p> <p>Leading shareholders said the vote should be a wake-up call for the board to listen to pension funds and other investors who own the business.</p> <p>After weathering the financial crisis, Standard Chartered was regarded as a star of the British banking industry. But after mis-steps including a profit warning and \u00a3415m in fines for breaching US sanctions against Iran, shareholders accuse it of complacency and not being alert to shifts in sentiment.</p> <p>A top 20 investor said: \"The profit warning and a string of negative surprises took the halo off the management team's aura of invincibility and opened it up to criticism, and I don't think they have handled it very well. They are surprised they had such a high vote against. We will wait and see what they do to improve.\"</p> <p>The shareholder revolt was aimed at bonuses linked to targets that could be hit in a single year. Investors and regulators want banks to pay top managers over a longer period in order to discourage short-term risky behaviour.</p> <p>A top 10 investor said there was disquiet over other matters such as the large number of executive directors on the board, chairman Sir John Peace's dual roles as chairman of Standard Chartered and fashion group Burberry, and the lack of independence of some non-executive directors.</p> <p>\"If you are making the decision to pay your directors at a certain level, you have got to go and engage with your shareholders. Their long-term problem is that if they don't start engaging with their shareholder base they are going to lose more support. They have to take a step back and ask: 'How should we go forward on this question of remuneration, what are shareholders' wider concerns and how are we going to address them?'\"</p> <p>Investors compared Standard Chartered's approach with that of HSBC. When HSBC realised investors were unhappy about a potential \u00a32.25m bonus for chairman Douglas Flint, it held talks with shareholders and staged a partial climbdown in an attempt to ward off a rebellion at this Friday's AGM. However, Standard Chartered failed to head off discontent before its AGM and came close to losing a binding vote on pay.</p> <p>A second top 10 shareholder said: \"The remuneration issue was really poorly conducted. Other banks like HSBC have handled the situation better.\"</p> <p>Another investor said: \"It was like they were making it up as they went along. They didn't communicate effectively or show any clear thinking behind their approach.\"</p> <p>Although the pay policy was passed, investors expect the bank to come back with revised proposals.</p> <p>Will Pomroy, policy lead at the National Association of Pension Funds, said: \"It is vitally important that companies engage with their shareholders. It is even more important that they subsequently both listen to and reflect upon the messages they hear. A significant response would be expected.\"</p> <p>Standard Chartered said: \"We actively solicit and react to all feedback from our shareholders, and hold an extensive programme of meetings between shareholders and a range of senior management. At the beginning of May we had already undertaken over 150 meetings among our top 25 shareholders, while in 2013 we had 270 meetings among the top 25.\"</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lord Myners has urged the Co-operative Group not to let negotiations over his recommended reforms delay the changes he thinks necessary if the supermarket and funeral homes business is to survive. Speaking after Co-op members voted to adopt principles based on his reform agenda, the former City minister warned against backtracking on his recommendations. \"My biggest single fear is that the process of discussion will be used as an excuse not to do much very quickly,\" he said. At a crucial meeting in Manchester on Saturday, support was given to four principles: the creation of a board of directors that is qualified to run a business the size of the Co-op; the creation of a structure that holds the board to account; the principle of one member one vote; and provisions to avoid demutualisation. Discussions over how to implement these principles began on Sunday. Members of the regional boards, which currently control 78% of the Co-op \u2013 held talks with Ursula Lidbetter, who chairs the Co-op, which lost \u00a32.5bn last year. The regions are thought to be keen to retain a presence on the board, where they currently hold 15 of the 21 seats, even though under the principles drawn up by Myners they would no longer have a place. Instead, under the Myners blueprint, the board would be chaired by an independent director and have around seven professional directors and two executives from the Co-op. The influence of these regional board members \u2013 dubbed \"democrats\" \u2013 is expected to be at the heart of the discussions with Lidbetter; further votes will need to be held for changes are to be made. The regional boards \u2013 the means by which the views of eight million Co-op members are heard \u2013 would also be abolished under the proposals outlined by Myners, who was chair of the Guardian Media Group \u2013 the publisher of the Guardian \u2013 until he joined the Labour government during the 2008 banking crisis. Myners told the Guardian that a \"commercially credible and experienced\" board needed to be created. \"They could create a smaller group with more expertise tomorrow. They won't do it but I believe there is a better than 50-50 chance they will move to a transitional board by the end of June,\" he said. Myners resigned from the board at the annual meeting, having tendered his resignation a month ago in the face of opposition to his reforms and after a brief four-month stint as senior independent director at the group. He was the only independent on the board, where the other five seats are held by representatives of the independent societies \u2013 such as Lincolnshire, which Lidbetter runs \u2013 and which together own 22% of the Group. The need for reform has forced Richard Pennycook, the interim chief executive, to delay his strategic review of the group. It has also delayed the publication of the findings of the \"have your say\" survey that former chief executive Euan Sutherland launched with much fanfare to establish what the public wanted the Co-op to represent. The survey also asked whether the group should stop making political donations to the Co-operative party, which is affiliated to Labour. In 2012 the Co-op donated \u00a3805,000 to the Co-operative party and its councillors. This included donations to 32 Labour and Co-operative MPs, as well as a one-off \u00a350,000 grant to the office of the shadow cabinet. At the AGM held before the vote on reforms, there was a revolt against a remuneration report, with 30% of votes against the pay deals for Sutherland and others . A vote on adopting pay ratios was rejected by the board. Only members of the regional boards and independent societies can go the AGM, which is attended by approximately 100 individuals. A full-scale strategy review is now not expected until November, although Pennycook is already overseeing the sale of the group's farms and the pharmacies to relieve pressure from the banks which are owned \u00a31.4bn by the Co-op. It is not clear when the findings of \"have your say\" will be released, although Pennycook said at the AGM that the traditional dividend to members would instead be ploughed into community and charity causes. Pennycook said on Saturday that debt repayments of \u00a3100m a year were holding the group back. \"That's \u00a3100m we could not invest to make our food stores better,\" he said. \"\u00a3100m we could not share with our members. \u00a3100m sucked down in the City of London rather than staying in the communities where our members live and work.\" Patrick Gray, the president of the Midcounties Co-operative, the biggest of the independent societies, said there was a \"measure of flexibility\" in the reforms but that reform was vital. \"The reform of the group is important for us not least for commercial reasons,\" he said.",

    "webTitle": "The eurozone's problems have not gone away, and elections won't change much", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Europe goes to the polls this week and the mood is sour. It is sour among voters and it is sour in the markets, where the sell-off at the end of last week was prompted by fears that the election results would open a new chapter in the eurozone crisis. That looks all too likely. Despite all the bullish talk in recent months, the problems of the eurozone have not gone away. The single currency's weaker members, such as Greece, Spain and Italy, found it easier for a while to sell their bonds at lower interest rates. But that was largely due to the generosity of the Federal Reserve, which flooded the global economy with dollars through its quantitative easing programme. The QE injection was a godsend to the eurozone, which has so far \u2013 but perhaps not for much longer \u2013 scorned the idea of turning on the electronic printing presses. US dollars found their way through the global financial system into European bond markets, and this allowed Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), to say he would do whatever it took to save the euro, without actually having to back his words with action. This new version of the postwar Marshall plan bought the eurozone some time. What it didn't do, however, was change the core economic problem of the eurozone's weak periphery. They are not growing nearly fast enough to prevent their debts becoming more onerous. Generalised austerity has made matters worse, as has the ECB's lack of sufficient offsetting action. Unemployment is high and voters are sick of austerity. It would be a mistake though to imagine that much, or indeed anything, will change as a result of the elections to the European parliament. There will be a lot of talk about how Europe needs to deliver for its people, and that will be it. Mainstream parties with their mainstream thinking will still be in charge and life will go on as before. As a result, Europe will condemn itself to an even longer period of economic stagnation, mass unemployment and austerity. Extremism will flourish. There is an alternative to this depressing scenario. Admit that it was a mistake of historic proportions to use the euro as a way of advancing the cause of ever closer union. Accept that and it is possible to avoid Europe becoming the new Japan. One of two things could happen. The euro could be fundamentally reformed along the lines proposed by Charles Grant, the director of the Centre for European Reform. This would involve throttling back on austerity, creating a banking union, structural reform in countries such as Italy to make them more competitive, rejigging the Germany economy to make it less export-focused, and a partial debt amnesty for the most heavily indebted eurozone members. The alternative is to break up the single currency, devolve power back to individual nations or groups of states with convergent economies, and start again. This is not going to happen, at least not yet. The euro symbolises the ever closer union dreamt of by Europe's founders back in the 1950s. Germany is Europe's strongest economy and its paymaster, so the euro is run along German lines. As the economist Roger Bootle puts it in his new book, The Trouble with Europe: \"The euro has been an economic disaster, imposed on Europe for political reasons. Ironically, it was thought that whatever its economic costs, it would at least bring Europe together politically. This may yet happen, but equally it could prove to be what drives Europe apart. From where I stand, the latter seems more likely.\" Bootle is right on every count. The euro has indeed been the economic disaster that some predicted when it was created at the end of the 1990s. There were warnings at the time that the single currency would prove to be a job-destroying machine. There were warnings too that many of the countries being yoked together were not ready for a one-size-fits-all monetary policy. It seemed glaringly obvious that in the absence of labour mobility and large-scale redistributions, countries stripped of the power to conduct their own monetary policy would have to resort to austerity if they became uncompetitive. All of this went unheeded. The euro, it was confidently predicted, would make Europe more prosperous and by doing so would create the conditions for ever closer union. The reality has been slow growth, high unemployment, botched structural reform, drift and growing discontent. Problems have arisen not just on the periphery but at the core, where economic performance has deteriorated markedly since the creation of the single currency. What happened, briefly, is this. The euro meant a single interest rate and a single exchange rate. The interest rate was too low for some countries, such as Ireland and Spain, which were growing fast. It was too high for countries such as Germany and France, which were growing less quickly. On the fringe, low interest rates encouraged property speculation and led to conditions in which inflation was higher than at the core. Before the creation of the euro, these countries would have let their currencies fall to compensate. That was now impossible, so they became less competitive at a time when Germany was busy making itself more competitive. For a decade, German workers took below-inflation wage increases to price their goods back into European markets. This was highly successful, up to a point. Germany's trade surplus soared, but the flipside was that trade deficits in countries such as Spain, Greece and Italy worsened. In the years before the crash, the system was kept going because Germany exported capital to the countries on the periphery to allow them to buy German goods. Then came the crisis. Germany insisted that if countries were in trouble, it was because they had lived beyond their means. This was a bit rich, given that Germany had been complicit in allowing them to do so. Berlin said it would help, but only on its own terms, which involved every country replicating Germany by squeezing domestic demand and promoting exports to become more competitive. This was clearly a logical impossibility since one country's surplus is another country's deficit. Countries could not become more competitive through devaluation, so they had to do so by austerity, cutting wages and public spending aggressively. At Germany's insistence, there was no austerity for the banks. Europe's leaders consider the euro too big to fail. They are wrong. It is already failing. It is failing to deliver the promised economic prosperity and it is failing to bring Europe together politically. The euro is like the gold standard, but worse, which is why it would be a mistake of historic proportions to ignore this week's votes. We know how this movie ends.",

      "body": "<p>Europe goes to the polls this week and the mood is sour. It is sour among voters and it is sour in the markets, where the sell-off at the end of last week was prompted by fears that the election results would open a new chapter in the eurozone crisis.</p> <p>That looks all too likely. Despite all the bullish talk in recent months, the problems of the eurozone have not gone away. The single currency's weaker members, such as Greece, Spain and Italy, found it easier for a while to sell their bonds at lower interest rates. But that was largely due to the generosity of the Federal Reserve, which flooded the global economy with dollars through its quantitative easing programme.</p> <p>The QE injection was a godsend to the eurozone, which has so far \u2013 but perhaps not for much longer \u2013 scorned the idea of turning on the electronic printing presses. US dollars found their way through the global financial system into European bond markets, and this allowed Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), to say he would do whatever it took to save the euro, without actually having to back his words with action.</p> <p>This new version of the postwar Marshall plan bought the eurozone some time. What it didn't do, however, was change the core economic problem of the eurozone's weak periphery. They are not growing nearly fast enough to prevent their debts becoming more onerous. Generalised austerity has made matters worse, as has the ECB's lack of sufficient offsetting action.</p> <p>Unemployment is high and voters are sick of austerity. It would be a mistake though to imagine that much, or indeed anything, will change as a result of the elections to the European parliament. There will be a lot of talk about how Europe needs to deliver for its people, and that will be it. Mainstream parties with their mainstream thinking will still be in charge and life will go on as before.</p> <p>As a result, Europe will condemn itself to an even longer period of economic stagnation, mass unemployment and austerity. Extremism will flourish.</p> <p>There is an alternative to this depressing scenario. Admit that it was a mistake of historic proportions to use the euro as a way of advancing the cause of ever closer union. Accept that and it is possible to avoid Europe becoming the new Japan.</p> <p>One of two things could happen. The euro could be fundamentally reformed along the lines proposed by Charles Grant, the director of the Centre for European Reform. This would involve throttling back on austerity, creating a banking union, structural reform in countries such as Italy to make them more competitive, rejigging the Germany economy to make it less export-focused, and a partial debt amnesty for the most heavily indebted eurozone members.</p> <p>The alternative is to break up the single currency, devolve power back to individual nations or groups of states with convergent economies, and start again.</p> <p>This is not going to happen, at least not yet. The euro symbolises the ever closer union dreamt of by Europe's founders back in the 1950s. Germany is Europe's strongest economy and its paymaster, so the euro is run along German lines.</p> <p>As the economist Roger Bootle puts it in his new book, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781857886153\" title=\"\">The Trouble with Europe</a>: \"The euro has been an economic disaster, imposed on Europe for political reasons. Ironically, it was thought that whatever its economic costs, it would at least bring Europe together politically. This may yet happen, but equally it could prove to be what drives Europe apart. From where I stand, the latter seems more likely.\"</p> <p>Bootle is right on every count. The euro has indeed been the economic disaster that some predicted when it was created at the end of the 1990s. There were warnings at the time that the single currency would prove to be a job-destroying machine. There were warnings too that many of the countries being yoked together were not ready for a one-size-fits-all monetary policy.</p> <p>It seemed glaringly obvious that in the absence of labour mobility and large-scale redistributions, countries stripped of the power to conduct their own monetary policy would have to resort to austerity if they became uncompetitive.

    "webTitle": "The H\u00f6vding collar: the cycle helmet that's more airbag than skid lid", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With one in every four journeys being taken along its 300-mile network of cycle lanes, Sweden's third city of Malm\u00f6 is often cited as one of the most cycle-friendly cities in a cycle-friendly country. But even in a place that appears a paradise for thousands who use cargo bikes to ferry their children to school and bring home the groceries, there have been arguments over safety. Every time any government proposes making cycle helmets compulsory, it sparks a fierce controversy; Malm\u00f6 was no exception when Swedish ministers mooted a helmet law in 2005. Just one in 10 cyclists in the city wears one, according to designers Anna Haupt and Terese Alstin. The pair thought there must be a way round people's resistance to traditional polystyrene crash helmets. Wouldn't it be better to design something that cyclists would be happy to wear? \"People told us they are too bulky. 'I think it makes me look geeky', 'I don't like the way it interferes with my personal style and my hairdo' \u2013 a lot of vanity involved of course,\" said Alstin. \"And then we just started brainstorming on how to solve all those problems for people. We started thinking about something that would not be on your head at all, in order to solve [the problem] that people wanted something that would not mess up their hair. That's what got us into thinking about airbag technology, because that is hidden most of the time until you need it and then it pops out.\" After seven years of research and \u20ac13m (\u00a310.6m) in funding, the result of their efforts can be seen on cyclists \u2013 although it can be hard to spot at first. Sitting around the neck like a snood, the H\u00f6vding collar \u2013 Swedish for chieftain \u2013 is packed with a folded airbag that inflates in a tenth of a second when the wearer is involved in an accident. With four upmarket London cycle shops now stocking the collar, the eagle-eyed may have spotted it around the UK capital. \"There are avalanche backpacks for skiers, there are vests with airbags for horseriders so it was starting to spread and we just decided that it is time for cyclists to have that protection as well,\" said Alstin. For the collar to know when to inflate, the designers needed data from thousands of accidents re-enacted using dummies. At the same time, data from normal cycling where an accident was not involved was also put together and an algorithm written to differentiate the two. Both crash scenarios and normal cycling movements were re-enacted with crash test dummies to give a bank of movement data for the device. When a cyclist turns on the H\u00f6vding, a sensor unit within the collar detects movements using gyroscopes and accelerometers \u2013 similar to technology used in smartphones and fitness bands. In the event of a crash, the sensors detect the movement and deploy the airbag. The sensors can detect characteristic movements that happen in a crash and the device reacts by inflating the bag with helium, creating a dome over the head that leaves the face free and cushioning an impact in a similar way to a car airbag. A black box records details of the accidents for research purposes. The collar is turned on by being zipped around the neck and attached with a clip, which prevents it accidentally triggering when not being worn. It is weighted at the back so it rests firmly while cycling and its creators say it gives greater cover to the head than traditional helmets. This is not the end of the designers' difficulties \u2013 they also have to persuade cyclists to trust that their invention will not let them down. \"I think people are very positive towards inventions until they are faced with the opportunity to try it themselves and then they turn into sceptics or they turn scared,\" said Alstin. \"There are always early adopters or people who want to try everything new but the majority of people want to just wait and see how it goes and hear from someone they really trust, someone really close to them that 'yes, it is actually working and saved me in an accident'. \"It takes a lot of time to convince people. In the markets that we have been in the longest, we can definitely see how it is turning and finally people are starting to believe that this is here and now and I can finally trust this product.\" With 20 employees at its Malm\u00f6 headquarters, the company has secured its \u20ac13m funding from 10 investors, with Alstin and Haupt retaining a minority shareholding. The company is expected to move into profit in two years, although sales figures remain confidential. The company will only say that the invention is used equally by both sexes. The arrival of the collar in London bike shops brings the number of stores it is sold in to 300 across 15 countries. Japan and north America beckon for future expansion, said Alstin. But the elaborate design comes at a price \u2013 including the fabric shell, which can give it a fashionable look, it costs \u00a3299. Additional fabric shells are another \u00a349. Once the airbag itself is inflated in a crash, it cannot be used again. Alstin admitted the cost was far higher than traditional helmets, which can cost a tenth of the price. \"We have lowered the price every time we have had a chance to do that. We are working really hard to do that to reduce costs all the time. \"New products will always be the most expensive in the beginning and of course as volumes go up, there is even more room for price reductions. But I mean of course, compared to a regular helmet, it is way more expensive. For a student or a family with a lot of kids, it is a lot of money and all I can say is that it is a very expensive product to produce so we don't really have the possibility to sell it any lower at this point.\" While the H\u00f6vding has just arrived in the UK, the airbag has already saved cyclists in other countries from injury, she said. \"It is an amazing feeling to see it out on the streets being worn but most motivating of course is when you get the feedback from people who have been in accidents and have been saved,\" she said. \"Most of our customers are people who have never worn a traditional helmet because they don't like them for different reasons and they are extremely thankful, but they know that if they had been in this accident without H\u00f6vding, 'I would have been completely unprotected and I don't know how that would have ended for me'.\" New in tech \u2022 Got small hands? The new HTC One mini 2 \u2013 poor name, interesting phone \u2013 could be for you. It takes everything that made its bigger, more expensive flagship brother the 5-star HTC One M8 great and shrinks it down into a more pocketable size. It is a \"selfie\" camera with enough photo editing tricks to make anyone look good in seconds. Its all-day battery and a beautiful metal design make the One mini 2 a great phone, even if its 4.5-inch screen means it really isn't all that mini. \u2022 Doctor Who is less fantastical a programme than you would think. Researchers from the University of Glasgow have created a sonic screwdriver. More like a pair of acoustic tweezers, the tool can move cells into patterns that could be used to repair damage to the human body. The patterns, described as a \"cell tartan\", could be created to fill holes or reconnect damaged nerves using just the power of sound. \u2022 Forget fingerprints \u2013 finger vein patterns are the new chip and pin. A new hi-tech cash machine is being rolled out in Poland that scans the unique pattern of veins in a user's finger. It matches the card to the finger to verify the owner's identity and allows him or her to withdraw cash. The finger has to be functioning for the technology to work, which thankfully discourages muggers from claiming fingers while liberating wallets. \u2022 Feature phones, the clunky precursors to smartphones that were centred on texts and calls, are dead. Motorola's new Moto E Android smartphone has them in its sights for \u00a390 or less. A solid smartphone with all-day battery life, it is set to disrupt the budget smartphone market and kill off traditional phones. Your next smartphone may cost less because of this little low-cost wonder. \u2022 It seems only months ago that the world was marvelling at the concept of 3D-printed mugs. Now there is talk of 3D-printed organs. Nanoengineers from the University of California, San Diego have created a 3D printer capable of printing a micro-cage that holds tiny particles capable of doing a liver's job and neutralising toxins from the blood. The hydrogel structure holds the nanoparticles in place, and turns red when toxins are captured. The technique could also be used to print replacement blood vessels and other parts.",

      "bodyText": "The combined fortune of Britain's richest 1,000 people has hit a new high of \u00a3519bn \u2013 equivalent to a third of the nation's economic output, and double the figure of five years ago. The worth of Britain's rich elite is up 15.4% from last year's total of \u00a3450bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Philip Beresford, who compiled the rankings, said: \"I've never seen such a phenomenal rise in personal wealth as the growth in the fortunes of Britain's 1,000 richest people over the past year. The richest people in Britain have had an astonishing year.\" The wealth of the top 1,000 has doubled since the financial crisis, rising from \u00a3258bn in 2009. Labour warned that the government was presiding over a widening equality gap. Chris Leslie, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"No wonder the super-rich have got much richer over the last year when David Cameron has given millionaires a huge tax cut. Yet at the same time working people have continued to face a cost-of-living crisis and are \u00a31,600 a year worse off since 2010. Labour is determined to ensure all working people feel the benefits of economic growth, not just a few at the top.\" Real wages \u2013 pay adjusted for inflation \u2013 have been falling until recently, although they are now starting to recover. Government figures showed last week that Britain's richest 1% had accumulated as much wealth as the poorest 55% put together. The data also revealed the extent of the inequality across the north-south divide, with household wealth in the south-east rising five times as quickly as the country's as a whole. Rachael Orr, head of Oxfam's UK poverty programme, said: \"We need our politicians to grasp the nettle and make narrowing the gap between the richest and poorest a top priority. It cannot be right that in Britain today a small elite are getting richer and richer while hundreds of thousands rely on food banks to feed their families. There is money to help the poorest \u2013 we just need to ensure that the richest are not only asked to pay their fair share in tax but also that the loopholes that allow many to dodge their obligations are closed.\" The list showed the Queen had a good year, adding \u00a310m to her personal fortune, and is now ranked 285 with \u00a3330m. The former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy, who stepped down from the supermarket chain in 2011, was among the new entrants with a worth of \u00a3100m, which put him in 863th place. Four Candy Crush millionaires joined the list for the first time. They include Melvyn Morris, the chairman of the company behind the addictive smartphone game, who came in at 238 with a \u00a3430m fortune, and Riccardo Zacconi, King Digital Entertainment's chief executive, ranked 271 with \u00a3354m. The masterminds behind the best-selling computer game Grand Theft Auto, brothers Sam and Dan Houser, who founded Rockstar Games in 1998, were also among the newcomers, at 947 with a joint fortune of \u00a390m. Beresford said: \"While some may criticise them, many of these people are at the heart of the economy and their success brings more jobs and more wealth for the country.\" To be considered for the list this year, a minimum of \u00a385m was required \u2013 compared with \u00a380m in 2008, before the crash, and \u00a375m last year. To get into the top 500, the rich needed \u00a3190m, up from \u00a3160m last year. Jamie Oliver and his wife, Jools, saw their worth go up by \u00a390m to \u00a3240m, putting them at 396, as the celebrity chef's restaurant chain, TV appearances, cookbook sales and his wife's childrenswear range continued to pay dividends. The South African insurance tycoon Douw Steyn saw his wealth go up by \u00a350m to \u00a3600m, ranking him at 170th, after a hugely popular meerkat TV advertising campaign for his firm comparethemarket.com. His personal fortune has soared from \u00a3200m in 2009, when the meerkats first appeared in ads. Entertainers featured heavily in the 50 Young Rich List for those aged 30 and under. The former Harry Potter star Emma Watson, 24, is now estimated to be worth \u00a330m, up \u00a33m on last year, as she builds a career as a Hollywood leading lady. Husband and wife Marcus Mumford, 27, and Carey Mulligan, 28, joined the young list for the first time with a joint fortune of \u00a313m from their music and films. The compilers of the rich list also found that the number of billionaires living in Britain had risen to more than 100 for the first time. Britain has 104 billionaires \u2013 more than triple the number a decade ago \u2013 who share a fortune of more than \u00a3301bn. This means Britain has more billionaires per capita than any other country, while London's total of 72 sterling billionaires is more than any other city in the world. The 26th annual Sunday Times Rich List is based on \"identifiable wealth\" \u2013 including land, property, other assets such as art and racehorses, or significant shares in publicly quoted companies. It excludes bank accounts, which the Sunday Times has no access to.",
