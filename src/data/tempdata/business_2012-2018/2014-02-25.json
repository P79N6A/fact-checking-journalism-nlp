Keen to impress his guests, the manager picked one up.</p> <p>After a lifetime in the trade, Osama Kaloti suggested he could tell the provenance and purity of each bar simply by its look and weight. This one was silver.</p> <p>Or so it seemed. Kaloti insisted the metal in his hand was gold. To prove his point, he scraped away the outer coating, revealing the yellow treasure beneath. There were about six bars in the stack, which might have weighed about 75kg in total. If gold, at today's prices, they would be worth $3.2m. If silver, the same size bars would be valued at less than $30,000.</p> <p>The inspectors, from Ernst &amp; Young Dubai, had been hired to audit Osama's family business Kaloti Group, Dubai's largest gold refinery, a process designed to assure important international customers that the company was doing all in its power to avoid conflict gold.</p> <p>Processing some 300 tonnes a year, Kaloti claims to account for close to half of all refining in Dubai's gold market. Regulators claim gold trading in the emirate reached $70bn in 2012, up 25% on the previous year.</p> <p>\"Dubai is emerging as a gold bullion centre to rival London, Shanghai and others,\" Osama's father, Munir Kaloti, who founded the business, explained to the Middle East Economic Digest in April last year. \"Dubai now accounts for approximately 25% of the world's annual gold trade. The principal challenge [our] company faces is ensuring the responsible sourcing of gold \u2026 Our safeguard measures are beyond the minimum set out by trade associations and government bodies.\"</p> <p>But back in the souk office, only the previous month, E&amp;Y inspectors could hardly believe what Osama was telling them. According to their minutes: \"He took a scanner and showed that the gold content was more than 85% and these bars are \u2026 from a Moroccan supplier. He said that it's normal to receive silver coated gold bars especially from Morocco due to the gold export limits imposed by the Moroccan customs.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-430752083\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/25/1393365036625/Dubai-gold-market-010.jpg\" alt=\"Dubai gold market\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gold trading in Dubai is said to have reached $70bn in 2012. Photograph: Karim Sahib/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also emerged the Moroccan suppliers had brought the shipment in by hand and were paid in cash at Kaloti's office in the souk. The shipment had left North Africa incorrectly labelled silver, and was properly accepted at Dubai airport customs as gold. It sounded like a smuggling scam.</p> <p>Further investigations found about four tonnes of gold, hidden beneath silver plating, may have come to Kaloti in a similar manner from several suppliers in Morocco. At today's prices, which are lower than those of 2012, four tonnes of gold is worth more than $170m.</p> <p>After being melted down, the bars would eventually emerge from the refinery as newly minted bullion, of 99.5% purity or greater, destined for the international gold market and stamped with a serial number and the words \"Kaloti, Dubai\".</p> <p>Following the E&amp;Y inspection, Kaloti expected to be able to claim that its gold bars had been independently verified as conflict-free and responsibly sourced. But the inspectors were rapidly taking a very different view. They were shocked by refinery admissions that it accepted gold which had probably been smuggled. This was to be just one of the failings they stumbled over but it was enough, they thought, to mean the refinery had already effectively failed its inspection and would receive from E&amp;Y the worst available score for the review period, covering the last seven months of 2012: \"Breach of review protocol and zero tolerance\".&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Serious </strong></p> <p>This score is reserved for the most serious lapses \u2013 such as refineries withholding information from reviewers, using unethical means to influence them, knowingly taking conflict gold, or taking gold from suppliers they know to have used falsified or misrepresented paperwork.&#xa0;</p> <p>Such a conclusion could even have resulted in the Dubai authorities stripping Kaloti of certification needed to trade easily with international customers. The damage to Dubai's reputation as a gold market would be huge.</p> <p>Of the gold seemingly smuggled from Morocco, E&amp;Y inspectors initially recorded in confidential reports that there had been \"misrepresentation and falsification of documentation by the ... supplier with the knowledge and acceptance of [Kaloti].\"</p> <p>There were other serious shortcomings. Kaloti records showed more than 1,000 transactions with customers walking into the group's office in the souk, off the street, without having to provide paperwork and being paid cash for gold. A total of 2.4 tonnes was accept this way, with company records showing simply \"call customer\".</p> <p>The average amount received from these walk-in customers was 2.25kg, but once gold weighing 35kg \u2014 the average weight of a 10-year-old boy in the UK \u2014 was exchanged for cash from a walk-in customer whose identity was unrecorded. Today this amount of gold would be worth about \u00a3850,000.</p> <p>And these cash deals were just a small fraction of Kaloti transactions taking place outside the banking system. \"EY team observed large quantities of cash in the vault,\" minutes of the inspectors' visit to the gold souk office recorded. \"Kaloti team explained that about 40% of the transaction value in Kaloti was carried out in cash in the Gold Souk office.\" E&amp;Y's eventual finding was that the refinery group's cash-for-gold deals in 2012 amounted to $5.2bn, compared to $6.6bn of transactions involving conventional bank transfers. If the office opened for business all year round that would still be equivalent to more than $14m a day being paid out to customers in cash.&#xa0;</p> <p>Kaloti told the inspectors clients sometimes preferred cash as payment via a bank transfer involved a charge of 1,000 dirhams (\u00a3163). It later added that cash deals had \"historically been the typical modus operandi in Dubai's cosmopolitan wholesale gold market\".</p> <p>Again the E&amp;Y inspectors were troubled. Kaloti had declared itself signed up to international guidelines recommending all gold firms should \"avoid cash purchases where possible, and ensure that all unavoidable cash purchases are supported by verifiable documentation\".&#xa0;</p> <p>Elsewhere, inspectors also found evidence of Kaloti transactions with suppliers from Sudan, a country linked to conflict gold in the past. Instead of showing heightened vigilance, Kaloti staff were happy to offer cash-in-hand in exchange for gold hand-delivered and originating from artisanal, small-scale mines (ASMs).</p> <p>Inspectors found Kaloti had no record of mining licences for the shipments, ensuring any audit trail to the source was lost. ASMs are low-tech, labour-intensive mining operations, highly vulnerable to extortion by armed groups.</p> <p>E&amp;Y inspectors diligently recorded each of the failures. Less than three months into their work, the list had become so concerning that they discreetly contacted the regulator, warning the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) of impending embarrassment.</p> <p>The response was a surprising one. One DMCC email inquired: \"We would like to understand that if we change the review period to Jan-March 2013 ... would there be a material difference that will impact the rating positively?\"</p> <p>This was the first indication that led some at E&amp;Y to believe the Dubai authorities were prepared to tinker with their own rules if the result spared the blushes of important players in the Dubai gold industry \u2013 an inference the DMCC says was unfounded.</p> <p>One internal E&amp;Y email revealed concern that Amjad Rihan, the partner in charge of the inspection team, was \"getting some heat from the regulator who is keen to promote the Dubai gold industry on the global stage\".</p> <p><strong>Unrealistic</strong></p> <p>It added: \"They have unrealistic expectations of their industry's level of compliance, which have repeatedly been communicated to them, and there is an undercurrent of them looking to use EY's brand for their advantage, which of course is being managed.\"</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, the regulator said: \"The DMCC strongly refutes any allegation that it pressured EY, that it sought to influence or interfere with the review process or that it softened the review process to favour any member refinery.\"</p> <p>Establishing the DMCC 12 years ago, Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed, said: \"The world's gold production is about 2,300-2,400 tonnes. Our main objective is to achieve half of the world production in the next few years. We have the will and the determination.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>While Dubai's wider economic fortunes faltered in 2009, the DMCC thrived, benefiting from a surging gold price and heavy demand from India and China, the emerging economic engines of global growth.</p> <p>In typical Dubai style, last year DMCC chairman Ahmed bin Sulayem celebrated this success by announcing the regulator had commissioned the Burj 2020, the world's tallest commercial tower, to be built for Dubai's hosting of the World Expo in six years' time.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Dubai's largest refinery group Kaloti in December broke ground on what it says will be the world's largest gold refinery, a new $60m plant with capacity to refine as much as 1,400 tonnes of gold a year.</p> <p>\"The construction of our new refinery is part of the company's overall strategy to expand its capacity up to 2,000 tonnes,\" said Munir Kaloti.</p> <p>In the end, the DMCC did not elect to alter the inspection period for Kaloti. Instead, between May and June last year, the regulator came up with another, less conspicuous, tweak to the rulebook.</p> <p>It removed a recommendation that the overall verdict of inspectors be recorded in public documents, instead ordering that any such reference must henceforth be kept confidential. At the time DMCC maintained, as it does now, these rule changes were being introduced \"to be consistent with similar global accepted guidance manuals\" \u2013 a claim verified by London consultancy firm SGS in a detailed report.</p> <p>Other gold regulators around the world were also fine-tuning rules at this time as they too assimilated international standards drawn up by the OECD.</p> <p>Nevertheless the DMCC's alteration \u2013 which was not to be the last occasion the regulator tinkered with the rules \u2013 greatly concerned senior partners at E&amp;Y Dubai, particularly Rihan, who led the division involved out the Kaloti audit.&#xa0;</p> <p>Behind the scenes he and senior executives at E&amp;Y Dubai contacted the audit group's global office in London asking for urgent advice on how best to treat the damaging findings in refinery inspection reports. \"The issue of conflict minerals is both delicate and critical for our business in Dubai and, indeed, the region,\" said one email to E&amp;Y's global head of climate change and sustainability Juan Costa Climent, a former Spanish finance minister. \"We need to take a position urgently and we need the global firm to be fully aware of the facts and the issues \u2026 I am sorry to press you on the matter but it is both serious and critical.\"</p> <p>Within two weeks the issue had been further escalated to Mark Otty, E&amp;Y's London-based managing partner for Europe, Middle East, India and Africa, who assembled a team of senior figures to deal with the matter, also calling in law firm Linklaters to provide outside advice.&#xa0; \"We are taking this issue very seriously,\" Otty wrote in one of a number of emails on the subject. \"I have taken the lead in relation to our investigation of it.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Dubai, it became increasingly clear that Kaloti did not see the problem. The refinery group began drafting an official summary of E&amp;Y's inspection \u2013 a document it believed would become the only publicly available report. Not only did it make no reference to the inspectors' overall conclusion, in accordance with the DMCC's new rules, but it also contained scant mention of many serious failings found by the independent review team.</p> <p>This was too much for E&amp;Y, which responded by indicating it would not be able to sign off on such a whitewash report as accurate.</p> <p>After Kaloti received a quiet word from the DMCC, however, it began to work more collaboratively with E&amp;Y towards a formula of words acceptable to both. Kaloti hired Jeff Rhodes, one of the most experienced executives in the Dubai gold industry who served on DMCC committees, to deal with the matter. By now Rihan, a 39-year-old partner at E&amp;Y, had stepped back from the project, remaining deeply uncomfortable.&#xa0;</p> <p>The work progressed without him, with both sides exchanging and refining drafts of what both inspectors and refinery staff believed would eventually be published as the official summary of the troublesome inspection.</p> <p>Leaked draft filings, attached in these email exchanges, show the extent to which E&amp;Y actively advised Kaloti how best to describe its shortcomings publicly.&#xa0;</p> <p>At one stage the audit firm recommended edits which removed reference to \"bars coated with silver\", replacing the words with a more generic reference to \"an incident in which there were certain documentary irregularities\". It was a formula Kaloti was quick to adopt. At a stroke, any suggestion of smuggling was replaced with a more anodyne phrase hinting at what may just have been a clerical error.</p> <p>Contacted by the Guardian, E&amp;Y was unable to answer several detailed questions because it was under a duty of confidentiality to Kaloti, but said: \"EY Dubai refutes entirely the suggestion that we did anything but highly professional work in relation to our engagement with Kaloti.\" It added that any failings discovered were fully reported to the DMCC. Meanwhile, the Guardian understands it is commonplace for audit firms to use their technical expertise to advise clients on the appropriate wording to be used in official reports.</p> <p>On 8 September last year official filings were submitted to DMCC, their language carefully polished and signed off by EY and by three managing directors at Kaloti.</p> <p>The phrase \"breach of review protocol \u2013 zero tolerance\" did appear in paperwork expected to be made public, but there was no indication it was also the inspectors' final conclusion.</p> <p>Colleagues at E&amp;Y told Rihan they regarded it a successful outcome. Otty urged him to look on the bright side. \"The situation has changed dramatically \u2026 In particular, we have a team in Dubai who have worked very hard to get us to the point that both client and regulator will report deficiencies,\" he emailed. \"On this basis I suggest that we \u2026 achieve all that you were focused on \u2013 and more.\" Joe Murphy, E&amp;Y Dubai managing partner, also suggested Rihan should no longer have cause for concern. \"Each of these clients has now issued a compliance report which satisfactorily takes into account the elements of non-compliance,\" he emailed. \"We can now expect that DMCC will publish the compliance report \u2026 There is now no tension or concern about reporting.\"</p> <p>Murphy may not have know it, but, in truth, tensions had not vanished. Kaloti was fuming.</p> <p>It felt it had been rushed into the regulatory submission. The company had understood that the controversial shipments from Morocco were going to be rated only as \"non-compliant, high risk\", but were told the rating would be \"breach of protocol and zero tolerance\" just days before the submission deadline.</p> <p>Despite being convinced E&amp;Y was wrong, three top Kaloti executives, signed the compliance report \u2014 even though the refinery believed it to be incorrect \u2014 and cleared the audit firm to submit it to the DMCC.</p> <p>Kaloti say this was done reluctantly, and only to meet a regulatory deadline.</p> <p>According to the DMCC, queries over the findings in the submitted Kaloti report were first raised with it by E&amp;Y, at the request of the refinery group.&#xa0;</p> <p>If it was unusual for a firm like E&amp;Y to be querying its own regulatory filings after they had been submitted, the move seemed doubly odd given that Otty and other senior figures at E&amp;Y's global head office in London had earlier spent considerable time wrestling over how best to treat the Morocco finding with the help of Linklaters.</p> <p>EY Dubai had concluded Kaloti's actions merited a rating of \"breach of review protocol and zero tolerance\". Now, however, they were no longer so sure.</p> <p>In response the DMCC contacted E&amp;Y giving its opinion of inspectors' assessment. That led the audit firm re reconsider its own view and ultimately to recall its 8 September submission.</p> <p>A new set of filings were entered one month later, this time with controversial dealings with Moroccan suppliers downgraded to \"High risk, non-compliance\".&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The exact reason for the reclassification is unclear, but confidential paperwork shows that it remained uncontested that Kaloti had told inspectors \"gold plated with silver was exported as silver in Morocco however the same is declared as gold at Dubai customs\".</p> <p>Again, the regulator rejected any allegation that it pressured E&amp;Y or in any other way acted improperly. E&amp;Y said it \"refutes entirely the suggestion that we did anything but highly professional work.\"</p> <p>The unusual circumstances in which the regulatory filings had been retracted was not the end of the matter.

      "bodyText": "The bars were stacked casually on a desk in a back office of Dubai's bustling gold souk, and they immediately caught the eye of the inspectors. Keen to impress his guests, the manager picked one up. After a lifetime in the trade, Osama Kaloti suggested he could tell the provenance and purity of each bar simply by its look and weight. This one was silver. Or so it seemed. Kaloti insisted the metal in his hand was gold. To prove his point, he scraped away the outer coating, revealing the yellow treasure beneath. There were about six bars in the stack, which might have weighed about 75kg in total. If gold, at today's prices, they would be worth $3.2m. If silver, the same size bars would be valued at less than $30,000. The inspectors, from Ernst &amp; Young Dubai, had been hired to audit Osama's family business Kaloti Group, Dubai's largest gold refinery, a process designed to assure important international customers that the company was doing all in its power to avoid conflict gold. Processing some 300 tonnes a year, Kaloti claims to account for close to half of all refining in Dubai's gold market. Regulators claim gold trading in the emirate reached $70bn in 2012, up 25% on the previous year. \"Dubai is emerging as a gold bullion centre to rival London, Shanghai and others,\" Osama's father, Munir Kaloti, who founded the business, explained to the Middle East Economic Digest in April last year. \"Dubai now accounts for approximately 25% of the world's annual gold trade. The principal challenge [our] company faces is ensuring the responsible sourcing of gold \u2026 Our safeguard measures are beyond the minimum set out by trade associations and government bodies.\" But back in the souk office, only the previous month, E&amp;Y inspectors could hardly believe what Osama was telling them. According to their minutes: \"He took a scanner and showed that the gold content was more than 85% and these bars are \u2026 from a Moroccan supplier. He said that it's normal to receive silver coated gold bars especially from Morocco due to the gold export limits imposed by the Moroccan customs.\" It also emerged the Moroccan suppliers had brought the shipment in by hand and were paid in cash at Kaloti's office in the souk. The shipment had left North Africa incorrectly labelled silver, and was properly accepted at Dubai airport customs as gold. It sounded like a smuggling scam. Further investigations found about four tonnes of gold, hidden beneath silver plating, may have come to Kaloti in a similar manner from several suppliers in Morocco. At today's prices, which are lower than those of 2012, four tonnes of gold is worth more than $170m. After being melted down, the bars would eventually emerge from the refinery as newly minted bullion, of 99.5% purity or greater, destined for the international gold market and stamped with a serial number and the words \"Kaloti, Dubai\". Following the E&amp;Y inspection, Kaloti expected to be able to claim that its gold bars had been independently verified as conflict-free and responsibly sourced. But the inspectors were rapidly taking a very different view. They were shocked by refinery admissions that it accepted gold which had probably been smuggled. This was to be just one of the failings they stumbled over but it was enough, they thought, to mean the refinery had already effectively failed its inspection and would receive from E&amp;Y the worst available score for the review period, covering the last seven months of 2012: \"Breach of review protocol and zero tolerance\". Serious This score is reserved for the most serious lapses \u2013 such as refineries withholding information from reviewers, using unethical means to influence them, knowingly taking conflict gold, or taking gold from suppliers they know to have used falsified or misrepresented paperwork. Such a conclusion could even have resulted in the Dubai authorities stripping Kaloti of certification needed to trade easily with international customers. The damage to Dubai's reputation as a gold market would be huge. Of the gold seemingly smuggled from Morocco, E&amp;Y inspectors initially recorded in confidential reports that there had been \"misrepresentation and falsification of documentation by the ... supplier with the knowledge and acceptance of [Kaloti].\" There were other serious shortcomings. Kaloti records showed more than 1,000 transactions with customers walking into the group's office in the souk, off the street, without having to provide paperwork and being paid cash for gold. A total of 2.4 tonnes was accept this way, with company records showing simply \"call customer\". The average amount received from these walk-in customers was 2.25kg, but once gold weighing 35kg \u2014 the average weight of a 10-year-old boy in the UK \u2014 was exchanged for cash from a walk-in customer whose identity was unrecorded. Today this amount of gold would be worth about \u00a3850,000. And these cash deals were just a small fraction of Kaloti transactions taking place outside the banking system. \"EY team observed large quantities of cash in the vault,\" minutes of the inspectors' visit to the gold souk office recorded. \"Kaloti team explained that about 40% of the transaction value in Kaloti was carried out in cash in the Gold Souk office.\" E&amp;Y's eventual finding was that the refinery group's cash-for-gold deals in 2012 amounted to $5.2bn, compared to $6.6bn of transactions involving conventional bank transfers. If the office opened for business all year round that would still be equivalent to more than $14m a day being paid out to customers in cash. Kaloti told the inspectors clients sometimes preferred cash as payment via a bank transfer involved a charge of 1,000 dirhams (\u00a3163). It later added that cash deals had \"historically been the typical modus operandi in Dubai's cosmopolitan wholesale gold market\". Again the E&amp;Y inspectors were troubled. Kaloti had declared itself signed up to international guidelines recommending all gold firms should \"avoid cash purchases where possible, and ensure that all unavoidable cash purchases are supported by verifiable documentation\". Elsewhere, inspectors also found evidence of Kaloti transactions with suppliers from Sudan, a country linked to conflict gold in the past. Instead of showing heightened vigilance, Kaloti staff were happy to offer cash-in-hand in exchange for gold hand-delivered and originating from artisanal, small-scale mines (ASMs). Inspectors found Kaloti had no record of mining licences for the shipments, ensuring any audit trail to the source was lost. ASMs are low-tech, labour-intensive mining operations, highly vulnerable to extortion by armed groups. E&amp;Y inspectors diligently recorded each of the failures. Less than three months into their work, the list had become so concerning that they discreetly contacted the regulator, warning the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) of impending embarrassment. The response was a surprising one. One DMCC email inquired: \"We would like to understand that if we change the review period to Jan-March 2013 ... would there be a material difference that will impact the rating positively?\" This was the first indication that led some at E&amp;Y to believe the Dubai authorities were prepared to tinker with their own rules if the result spared the blushes of important players in the Dubai gold industry \u2013 an inference the DMCC says was unfounded. One internal E&amp;Y email revealed concern that Amjad Rihan, the partner in charge of the inspection team, was \"getting some heat from the regulator who is keen to promote the Dubai gold industry on the global stage\". Unrealistic It added: \"They have unrealistic expectations of their industry's level of compliance, which have repeatedly been communicated to them, and there is an undercurrent of them looking to use EY's brand for their advantage, which of course is being managed.\" In a statement to the Guardian, the regulator said: \"The DMCC strongly refutes any allegation that it pressured EY, that it sought to influence or interfere with the review process or that it softened the review process to favour any member refinery.\" Establishing the DMCC 12 years ago, Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed, said: \"The world's gold production is about 2,300-2,400 tonnes. Our main objective is to achieve half of the world production in the next few years. We have the will and the determination.\" While Dubai's wider economic fortunes faltered in 2009, the DMCC thrived, benefiting from a surging gold price and heavy demand from India and China, the emerging economic engines of global growth. In typical Dubai style, last year DMCC chairman Ahmed bin Sulayem celebrated this success by announcing the regulator had commissioned the Burj 2020, the world's tallest commercial tower, to be built for Dubai's hosting of the World Expo in six years' time. Meanwhile, Dubai's largest refinery group Kaloti in December broke ground on what it says will be the world's largest gold refinery, a new $60m plant with capacity to refine as much as 1,400 tonnes of gold a year. \"The construction of our new refinery is part of the company's overall strategy to expand its capacity up to 2,000 tonnes,\" said Munir Kaloti. In the end, the DMCC did not elect to alter the inspection period for Kaloti. Instead, between May and June last year, the regulator came up with another, less conspicuous, tweak to the rulebook. It removed a recommendation that the overall verdict of inspectors be recorded in public documents, instead ordering that any such reference must henceforth be kept confidential. At the time DMCC maintained, as it does now, these rule changes were being introduced \"to be consistent with similar global accepted guidance manuals\" \u2013 a claim verified by London consultancy firm SGS in a detailed report. Other gold regulators around the world were also fine-tuning rules at this time as they too assimilated international standards drawn up by the OECD. Nevertheless the DMCC's alteration \u2013 which was not to be the last occasion the regulator tinkered with the rules \u2013 greatly concerned senior partners at E&amp;Y Dubai, particularly Rihan, who led the division involved out the Kaloti audit. Behind the scenes he and senior executives at E&amp;Y Dubai contacted the audit group's global office in London asking for urgent advice on how best to treat the damaging findings in refinery inspection reports. \"The issue of conflict minerals is both delicate and critical for our business in Dubai and, indeed, the region,\" said one email to E&amp;Y's global head of climate change and sustainability Juan Costa Climent, a former Spanish finance minister. \"We need to take a position urgently and we need the global firm to be fully aware of the facts and the issues \u2026 I am sorry to press you on the matter but it is both serious and critical.\" Within two weeks the issue had been further escalated to Mark Otty, E&amp;Y's London-based managing partner for Europe, Middle East, India and Africa, who assembled a team of senior figures to deal with the matter, also calling in law firm Linklaters to provide outside advice. \"We are taking this issue very seriously,\" Otty wrote in one of a number of emails on the subject. \"I have taken the lead in relation to our investigation of it.\" Meanwhile, in Dubai, it became increasingly clear that Kaloti did not see the problem. The refinery group began drafting an official summary of E&amp;Y's inspection \u2013 a document it believed would become the only publicly available report. Not only did it make no reference to the inspectors' overall conclusion, in accordance with the DMCC's new rules, but it also contained scant mention of many serious failings found by the independent review team. This was too much for E&amp;Y, which responded by indicating it would not be able to sign off on such a whitewash report as accurate. After Kaloti received a quiet word from the DMCC, however, it began to work more collaboratively with E&amp;Y towards a formula of words acceptable to both. Kaloti hired Jeff Rhodes, one of the most experienced executives in the Dubai gold industry who served on DMCC committees, to deal with the matter. By now Rihan, a 39-year-old partner at E&amp;Y, had stepped back from the project, remaining deeply uncomfortable. The work progressed without him, with both sides exchanging and refining drafts of what both inspectors and refinery staff believed would eventually be published as the official summary of the troublesome inspection. Leaked draft filings, attached in these email exchanges, show the extent to which E&amp;Y actively advised Kaloti how best to describe its shortcomings publicly. At one stage the audit firm recommended edits which removed reference to \"bars coated with silver\", replacing the words with a more generic reference to \"an incident in which there were certain documentary irregularities\". It was a formula Kaloti was quick to adopt. At a stroke, any suggestion of smuggling was replaced with a more anodyne phrase hinting at what may just have been a clerical error. Contacted by the Guardian, E&amp;Y was unable to answer several detailed questions because it was under a duty of confidentiality to Kaloti, but said: \"EY Dubai refutes entirely the suggestion that we did anything but highly professional work in relation to our engagement with Kaloti.\" It added that any failings discovered were fully reported to the DMCC. Meanwhile, the Guardian understands it is commonplace for audit firms to use their technical expertise to advise clients on the appropriate wording to be used in official reports. On 8 September last year official filings were submitted to DMCC, their language carefully polished and signed off by EY and by three managing directors at Kaloti. The phrase \"breach of review protocol \u2013 zero tolerance\" did appear in paperwork expected to be made public, but there was no indication it was also the inspectors' final conclusion. Colleagues at E&amp;Y told Rihan they regarded it a successful outcome. Otty urged him to look on the bright side. \"The situation has changed dramatically \u2026 In particular, we have a team in Dubai who have worked very hard to get us to the point that both client and regulator will report deficiencies,\" he emailed. \"On this basis I suggest that we \u2026 achieve all that you were focused on \u2013 and more.\" Joe Murphy, E&amp;Y Dubai managing partner, also suggested Rihan should no longer have cause for concern. \"Each of these clients has now issued a compliance report which satisfactorily takes into account the elements of non-compliance,\" he emailed. \"We can now expect that DMCC will publish the compliance report \u2026 There is now no tension or concern about reporting.\" Murphy may not have know it, but, in truth, tensions had not vanished. Kaloti was fuming. It felt it had been rushed into the regulatory submission. The company had understood that the controversial shipments from Morocco were going to be rated only as \"non-compliant, high risk\", but were told the rating would be \"breach of protocol and zero tolerance\" just days before the submission deadline. Despite being convinced E&amp;Y was wrong, three top Kaloti executives, signed the compliance report \u2014 even though the refinery believed it to be incorrect \u2014 and cleared the audit firm to submit it to the DMCC. Kaloti say this was done reluctantly, and only to meet a regulatory deadline. According to the DMCC, queries over the findings in the submitted Kaloti report were first raised with it by E&amp;Y, at the request of the refinery group. If it was unusual for a firm like E&amp;Y to be querying its own regulatory filings after they had been submitted, the move seemed doubly odd given that Otty and other senior figures at E&amp;Y's global head office in London had earlier spent considerable time wrestling over how best to treat the Morocco finding with the help of Linklaters. EY Dubai had concluded Kaloti's actions merited a rating of \"breach of review protocol and zero tolerance\". Now, however, they were no longer so sure. In response the DMCC contacted E&amp;Y giving its opinion of inspectors' assessment. That led the audit firm re reconsider its own view and ultimately to recall its 8 September submission. A new set of filings were entered one month later, this time with controversial dealings with Moroccan suppliers downgraded to \"High risk, non-compliance\". The exact reason for the reclassification is unclear, but confidential paperwork shows that it remained uncontested that Kaloti had told inspectors \"gold plated with silver was exported as silver in Morocco however the same is declared as gold at Dubai customs\". Again, the regulator rejected any allegation that it pressured E&amp;Y or in any other way acted improperly. E&amp;Y said it \"refutes entirely the suggestion that we did anything but highly professional work.\" The unusual circumstances in which the regulatory filings had been retracted was not the end of the matter. Less than three weeks later, the DMCC would change the inspection reporting rules once again, this time in a way that meant Kaloti's second compliance report, with the downgraded finding, would never be made public. It was a move that surprised some at E&amp;Y. As the weeks had passed, without the anticipated publication, members of the inspection team became increasingly puzzled why no reports had been made public. By this time they were completing a brief follow-up inspection to verify Kaloti had put in place remedial action, and that failings earlier identified by E&amp;Y had not reoccurred. As part of this process they noted that the failure to publish a compliance report once again put Kaloti on track for further public criticisms. DMCC guidance required refiners to \"publicly report ... to generate public confidence [in the inspection process]\".

There are millions of things that can be done, hundreds of recipes\u201d. The cronut threatens to overtake his reputation, and Ansel, whipping out airy madeleines and salted caramel eclairs, is determined to not be known just as the guy who came up with it.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want the creation\u201d \u2013 he calls the cronut \u201cthe creation,\u201d as a wry Dr Frankeinstein might have referred to his monster \u2013 \u201cto kill our creativity\u201d, Ansel says. \u201cWe are actually more known for our creativity than the cronut. And people come because they know we do things that are unusual.\u201d</p> <p>Thus the burning eyes he lends to his latest invention: the magic souffl\u00e9. It never deflates, and the recipe is a secret. Then listen to Ansel\u2019s spontaneous treatise on his latest, <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/frozen-smores-192371\">frozen s\u2019mores</a> \u2013 a confection made of ice cream wrapped in a light wafer inside a marshmallow that is set aflame in front of you \u2013 and your mind may wander from hunger. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2d3b0668-0809-42bb-a607-efb98d5eb427\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/30/1391098218729/8289d908-7e29-4783-9325-8d6b9fc290db-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"US MONEY Dominique Ansel Bakery\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominique Ansel is both a chef and a business owner.

An edited transcript of our conversation follows. </p> <p><b>Why did you decide to start your own bakery?</b></p> <p>When I first started the bakery, a lot of people were telling me: \u2018Do not only do pastries. It\u2019s not going to work. A pastry shop in New York is not going to work. People don\u2019t go for just pastries. You have to have a big lunch menu and ton of sandwiches.\u2019 And I did not really want to listen to anyone.</p> <p>I had my idea of how I wanted to make pastries and where I wanted to take the pastry world. And I found a way to really give people different perception of what pastries are \u2013 it\u2019s not always this really big tall cake that is rich with buttercream and is sweet and spongy. That\u2019s not it. Pastries can be really refined, can be very delicate and creative, artistic. That\u2019s something that\u2019s very important for me.</p> <p><b>You grew up in a poor neighborhood in France, and now devote some of your profits in giving back to similar neighborhoods here in the US. Why is that an important part of your business?</b></p> <p>I never forgot where I was from. When I was younger, there were days when I was really hungry, when my parents couldn\u2019t afford to buy much food. Sometimes, we had just bread and we didn\u2019t really have much money to buy food. And nowadays, in a big city like New York, people kind of forget because there\u2019s a lot of food, a lot of restaurants, but there is still a lot of people who are hungry in the city. It\u2019s something I don\u2019t forget and will never forget.</p> <p>When I have a chance to use the passion that people have for my product and I can use it towards something that\u2019s going to do a lot of good for other people, it\u2019s a chance for me to do something good. When I saw that I could help and do something like auctioning cronuts, for example, at a charity auction, I happily did it. It\u2019s a little bit of extra work, but you just donate some of your time and energy to do something. With all the money we raised last year, we fed hundreds of thousands of people between the <a href=\"http://www.foodbanknyc.org/\">Food Bank for New York</a> and <a href=\"https://www.glwd.org/\">God\u2019s Love We Deliver</a> auction against hunger. There was one auction where we sold <a href=\"http://www.grubstreet.com/2013/10/winning-cronut-bidder.html\">12 cronuts for over $14,000</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-36c62b2e-c111-40be-b824-cf5230657728\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/25/1393354397517/9a95a075-0b57-4497-b200-df98cdfbca45-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cronut\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An original Cronut from the New York bakery Dominque Ansel. Photograph: Dominique Ansel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><b>Do you feel that more businesses should have social missions?</b></p> <p>Absolutely, especially when it comes to your city and your neighborhood, you should just look around and see that people have needs and sometimes it just takes for you to be willing to do this extra work to help them. People tend to forget, because you have a decent situation, you always have food, you always have meal with your family, but you forget that people need your help sometimes.</p> <p><b>What\u2019s different now that you are a business owner in addition to being a chef?</b></p> <p>You constantly have to make decisions and keep improving, training your staff, building a team. I think the biggest difference is that when you are a chef, you mostly focus on working in the kitchen. When you are a business owner, you are more focused on growing your business and the demands of your clients, and especially building a culture of your business. When you are a chef in the kitchen, people always look up to you and they always follow your lead. When you are a business owner, you have more things that you don\u2019t deal with when you are a chef. So building a culture is really having a philosophy on how to deal with things.</p> <p>For example, when we first had the line outside the bakery, it was very important for me to decide to sell to them and to acknowledge that they were here. So in the morning right now, we pass [out] hot chocolate, fresh baked mini-madeleines, hand-warmers. It\u2019s very important for me to keep focusing on my customers as soon as they get to us, not just when they walk into the shop. It\u2019s not something that a chef would necessarily think about. But as a business owner, you have to take that into consideration.</p> <p><b>I saw that on Valentine\u2019s day <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DominiqueAnsel/status/434307839067430912\">you passed out roses</a> to people waiting in line. <br></b></p> <p>That\u2019s another example. I like to be close to my customers. They thought of coming early on the cold day [and] I want to make sure they have at least something nice, something sweet from us, just to let them know that we know they are there. It\u2019s cold and I really want to take good care of them.</p> <p><b>I also saw you tweet some wishes from your wishing tree. Were you flattered by some of those?</b></p> <p>Yea. We did a wishing tree for valentine\u2019s day that we left here inside the bakery and we invited people to just write a wish and put it on the tree. Actually, a lot of people played along and we had some sweet ones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DominiqueAnsel/status/435802636592246785/photo/1\" data-alt=\"US MONEY Dominique Ansel Valentine's day wishes\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking down Valentine&amp;#39;s Day decorations and found these &amp;quot;wishes&amp;quot; on our Wishing Tree... &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/quuu2qQnJD&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/quuu2qQnJD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dominique Ansel (@DominiqueAnsel) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DominiqueAnsel/statuses/435802636592246785&quot;&gt;February 18, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <b>Many of them wished for a cronut, a product that you recently trademarked. Was that an important decision for you to make?<br><br></b> <p>This is one of those decisions that you make as a business owner, not as a chef. The trademark of the cronut was a very important decision for us. [The trademark application] was a suggestions from a lawyer that cares for us and she suggested this to protect us. As a chef, you don\u2019t really know if you need to do this. We really quickly realized that a lot of small business owners are just bullied by [bigger companies]. If you don\u2019t protect your trademark, they will try to register the name before you do and they will stop you from using your creation.</p> <p><b>Kind of like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/05/patent-trolls-threat-innovation\">patent trolls</a>.</b></p> <p>Exactly. It\u2019s really important for me as a small business owner to stand up and say \u2018I am going to protect my trademark.\u2019 This is my creation and I am going to protect it so that I can ensure I can continue making it.</p> <p><b>I found it very interesting that when people ask you why don\u2019t you just make more cronuts, <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/jill-krasny/cronuts-dominque-ansel-interview.html\">you\u2019ve said</a> \u201cYou don\u2019t go to a doctor and tell him to make more surgeries.\u201d You emphasize quality over quantity. Is that part of your philosophy?</b></p> <p>It\u2019s the same reason that you don\u2019t ask writer to write four times more articles. I want to control the quality of the product. I want to sell people a good quality product for a fair price. A lot of people also ask me, why don\u2019t you sell out to a big factory and make tons of money? But this isn\u2019t about money.</p> <p>This is what we believe in. It\u2019s not about making tons and trying to sell as many as you can. It\u2019s about making a very good, very high-end quality product and giving people the best experience. It\u2019s not about raising the price for cronuts or selling it for twice more. Would they still sell out? Probably yes. But I don\u2019t want to treat my customers like that. I want them to have a fair price for a fair product. This is what I believe in. </p> <p><b>Some people say \u201cWell, what else can you do with a pastry business?\u201d You\u2019ve proven that there is room for innovation and creativity. And you have previously mentioned that you have many more ideas. Why is it so important to stay creative?</b></p> <p>I think it\u2019s the same for every field. Knowing that you did something well, it\u2019s not enough for this world. For example, if Van Gogh had only painted one painting and stopped there, no one would know about him. You start a new trend, you really explore your field and you go beyond what you know and what can be done. Beyond what people think can be done. There\u2019s no limit if you are creative, flexible and have imagination. It\u2019s just a matter of really understanding your customer and understanding what they are looking for.</p> <p>We see it here at the bakery a lot. For example, in the beginning, I made a point to change the menu every six to eight weeks, which is very unusual for a bakery. People would change a menu once, twice a year. We change it very often, as often as a restaurant. In the beginning, people were coming back and were sad not to find the pastries that they saw a month or so ago. But now people come back and they are excited about new items and they are excited about change.</p> <p>They bring new friends, they bring family here. There is this energy, this willingness to stay open minded and learn about new things that New York has. It\u2019s really an exciting place for a chef to be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c86c16f9-f002-4198-b1ea-2478e0d348a2\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/30/1391098365797/a1d3fd40-bb8f-4c13-a85a-cf4984f0b722-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"US MONEY Dominique Ansel Bakery\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">According to Dominique Ansel, New York is an exciting place for a chef to be.

Yeah. It\u2019s very important for me. It\u2019s part of our culture. I always say I don\u2019t want the creation to kill the creativity. A creation \u2013 one of them was a cronut \u2013 I don\u2019t want us to stop yet and kill our creativity. We can do a lot more. We can do so many more things and it\u2019s very important for me to have my staff involved in this aspect so I always push them to think out of the box, to think differently. Because they also have ideas. Because they also have different experience and sharing and seeing my staff growing with me, it\u2019s something that is very unique and amazing for me.</p> <p><b>You previously helped expand Fauchon into places like Russia, Egypt \u2026</b></p> <p>\u2026 Kuwait \u2026</p> <p><b>What have you learned from that? Was it different than setting up your own business?</b></p> <p>I learned a lot. I\u2019ve learned all the things you should and shouldn\u2019t do. Fauchon\u2019s concept overseas was really copy-and-paste, it was a replica of what it was in Paris, which [in] some places works very well, and [in] some others, not at all. I think for me, it\u2019s very important for business to have a mindful growth but to also understand the market. If I were to open a place, a bakery a block away, it would have to be different. It would have to fit to the neighborhood, to have its own identity and personality. As a business owner you really adapt your concept, your ideas, your product, your service based on the location and your customers.</p> <p>This is one of the most important things I have learned with Fauchon.</p> <p><b>When you first came up with the cronut \u2013 there was a lot of attention. How did you feel about all of that attention?</b></p> <p>At first, it was a little bit overwhelming. You know it\u2019s not something that we were expecting. The first day that we launched cronut, someone from Grub Streeet came here and took a photo of it and <a href=\"http://www.grubstreet.com/2013/05/dominique-ansel-cronut.html\">posted it</a>. It was a small article, just like a write-up of something new that we were doing because we always do something new. The same night, they called us and they told us they had increase of traffic of 300%. They technically told us they had never seen anything like this and that we should be ready to get busy.</p> <p>The first day I made maybe like 35? The second day, I decided to make 50. The first day we sold out in about 15 minutes. The second day in 10. And by the third day, we had a line of about 100 people waiting outside before work by the doors. And that\u2019s how the crazy began. I was really shocked. And we were not ready [laughs] to have a line of people outside the shop. We had very busy lines in the morning before the cronut, but not that amount of people coming for one product. It was something really unexpected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DominiqueAnsel/status/434309057768615936\" data-alt=\"US MONEY Dominique Ansel Valentine's day\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting our all PINK pastry case ready. &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/UvlvxDgDPo&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/UvlvxDgDPo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dominique Ansel (@DominiqueAnsel) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DominiqueAnsel/statuses/434309057768615936&quot;&gt;February 14, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><b>This was all word-of-mouth advertising.</b></p> <p>People often ask, \u2018Was it a PR strategy?\u2019 And we are like \u2018No, not at all\u2019. There is no PR strategy, there is no PR team, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s planned. We do things naturally.</p> <p>I do things that are genuine, with my heart and when I decide to buy few dozen roses to give to our first few customers in line, it\u2019s because I believe that it\u2019s a special day for them. And if I can make it a little more special for them and happier for them, I will do it.</p> <p>[In the morning], the most exciting part is really being at the register and see people leave the shop, saying goodbye to each other after standing on the line together. They spend time together. They exchange emails. They exchange phone numbers.</p> <p><b>You could start a cronut match-making service.</b></p> <p>[Laughs] They really become friends. It doesn\u2019t matter where they are from, which part of the world, what part of the city they are from. They talk and befriend each other.</p> <p><b>Do you have friends and family ask you for a cronut?</b></p> <p>Not all of them, because they know I don\u2019t make exceptions.</p> <p><b>They would have to get on the line.</b></p> <p>Most of them, friends and family, have actually never tried a cronut. I\u2019ve made rules since the very beginning and I have to stand by them. Everyone, all of my close friends and family, knows that they shouldn\u2019t ask me. My answer would be the same as for everyone: they should wait in the line. That\u2019s something I believe in, fairness for everyone. Good quality product for a fair price and everyone being treated equally.</p> <p><b>You had a special Valentine\u2019s Day menu. How did it go?</b></p> <p>It was amazing. That was our busiest day so far. And it was also last year. This year we have done everything in pink and we had \u2013 and this is very funny \u2013 most of our clients are actually gentlemen.</p> <p><b>Really?</b></p> <p>Yes, for Valentine\u2019s Day. For that day, we would see a good 80% of customers that are men. And when they walk into the shop with the hearts, and the cases are all pink, and we\u2019re playing love songs, and there are rose petals all over the floor, it\u2019s all very feminine. It\u2019s not a place where you would expect men to be, but they are all very smiley, and a little bit shy and they ask about recommendations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9d46e085-e56f-4016-a668-923ca294def4\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/30/1391098290429/03f6a346-1f14-4d47-adb4-3ed73c6cc77d-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"US MONEY Dominique Ansel Bakery\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At Dominique Ansel Bakery, customers have a variety of treats to choose from.

Yes. [laughs]</p> <b>How different would you say they were?</b> <b><br></b> <p>There\u2019s a lot more tradition and roots and history [in France]. France is a little bit more conservative when it comes to food. They know what they like and they like what they know. They don\u2019t like change too much. They like the things they have tasted before. They like French food.</p> <p>New Yorkers, Americans are completely different. They are a lot more open-minded. They travel a lot more. They are willing to discover new flavors, new textures and just new things from all over the world. That\u2019s why I think New York is one of the most exciting food scenes in the world today. And I firmly believe this, because I\u2019ve had some of my best meals ever in New York.</p> <b>So what\u2019s next for your bakery?<br><br></b> <p>Well, right now I am writing a book, a cookbook with Simon &amp; Schuster to come out in October of this year. So that\u2019s what\u2019s right now.</p> <p>And then when it comes to expansion \u2013 any healthy and safe business should expand. It should be a mindful growth and it should take into consideration, as I said earlier, the place, the location, the customers, the concept. To me, it\u2019s not just opening something. There should be something really unique and special about it, something that has a heart, something that people believe in.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dominique Ansel is part pastry chef, part cult leader. He describes a souffl\u00e9 with unflinching eye contact and drool-inducing detail. His marble-tiled bakery, in Manhattan\u2019s Soho neighborhood, resembles a temple to airy, flaky, crusty idols of pastry. Yet the world of food blogs, the name Dominique Ansel is almost synonymous with one word: cronut. This causes Ansel no small amount of pain. The cronut, equal parts donut and croissant, inspired numerous knockoffs and lines of salivating foodies after Ansel introduced the world to it last May. Ansel, by all accounts a serious chef who was nominated this year for a prestigious James Beard Foundation award, has been backed into acting as a stage manager for the flaky, creamy little usurper. \u201cIf you are the first in line, you\u2019ll see me,\u201d says Ansel, who unlocks the door every morning at 8am to dozens of expectant faces. He\u2019s known for urging patrons not to buy cronuts on Craigslist, a corner of which has become a black market for the pastry. Blinding sun, pouring rain, sleet and snow have done little to dissuade fanatics from surrounding the Dominique Ansel Bakery. Staff are known to issue detailed, friendly cronut explainers to the odd tourist who expects to get a cronut any time after 8.30am. No one is allowed to jump the line, Ansel\u2019s own family included. The only loosened rule in the cronut\u2019s short history: a man, first in line at 4am, carrying an airline boarding pass. His goal: proving he needed a cronut before the bakery opened so he could use it to propose to his girlfriend. Ansel\u2019s team sold him a cronut at 7am, and the man rushed off to his 8.30am flight and, possibly, wedded bliss. You can guess what it\u2019s like to deal with this kind of thing most days. Though Ansel seems both amused and flattered, his expertise as a chef and business owner doesn\u2019t extend to hijinks like panicky suitors. Ansel, who spent six years working as an executive pastry chef at Daniel Boulud\u2019s Daniel and helped expand French gourmet food company Fauchon, says \u201cthe world of pastries is ripe for exploring. There are millions of things that can be done, hundreds of recipes\u201d. The cronut threatens to overtake his reputation, and Ansel, whipping out airy madeleines and salted caramel eclairs, is determined to not be known just as the guy who came up with it. \u201cI don\u2019t want the creation\u201d \u2013 he calls the cronut \u201cthe creation,\u201d as a wry Dr Frankeinstein might have referred to his monster \u2013 \u201cto kill our creativity\u201d, Ansel says. \u201cWe are actually more known for our creativity than the cronut. And people come because they know we do things that are unusual.\u201d Thus the burning eyes he lends to his latest invention: the magic souffl\u00e9. It never deflates, and the recipe is a secret. Then listen to Ansel\u2019s spontaneous treatise on his latest, frozen s\u2019mores \u2013 a confection made of ice cream wrapped in a light wafer inside a marshmallow that is set aflame in front of you \u2013 and your mind may wander from hunger. To find out more about the life after the cronut, we sat down with Ansel in his bakery and spoke about the differences between being a chef and a business owner, growing up poor in France and the importance of giving back. An edited transcript of our conversation follows. Why did you decide to start your own bakery? When I first started the bakery, a lot of people were telling me: \u2018Do not only do pastries. It\u2019s not going to work. A pastry shop in New York is not going to work. People don\u2019t go for just pastries. You have to have a big lunch menu and ton of sandwiches.\u2019 And I did not really want to listen to anyone. I had my idea of how I wanted to make pastries and where I wanted to take the pastry world. And I found a way to really give people different perception of what pastries are \u2013 it\u2019s not always this really big tall cake that is rich with buttercream and is sweet and spongy. That\u2019s not it. Pastries can be really refined, can be very delicate and creative, artistic. That\u2019s something that\u2019s very important for me. You grew up in a poor neighborhood in France, and now devote some of your profits in giving back to similar neighborhoods here in the US. Why is that an important part of your business? I never forgot where I was from. When I was younger, there were days when I was really hungry, when my parents couldn\u2019t afford to buy much food. Sometimes, we had just bread and we didn\u2019t really have much money to buy food. And nowadays, in a big city like New York, people kind of forget because there\u2019s a lot of food, a lot of restaurants, but there is still a lot of people who are hungry in the city. It\u2019s something I don\u2019t forget and will never forget. When I have a chance to use the passion that people have for my product and I can use it towards something that\u2019s going to do a lot of good for other people, it\u2019s a chance for me to do something good. When I saw that I could help and do something like auctioning cronuts, for example, at a charity auction, I happily did it. It\u2019s a little bit of extra work, but you just donate some of your time and energy to do something. With all the money we raised last year, we fed hundreds of thousands of people between the Food Bank for New York and God\u2019s Love We Deliver auction against hunger. There was one auction where we sold 12 cronuts for over $14,000. Do you feel that more businesses should have social missions? Absolutely, especially when it comes to your city and your neighborhood, you should just look around and see that people have needs and sometimes it just takes for you to be willing to do this extra work to help them. People tend to forget, because you have a decent situation, you always have food, you always have meal with your family, but you forget that people need your help sometimes. What\u2019s different now that you are a business owner in addition to being a chef? You constantly have to make decisions and keep improving, training your staff, building a team. I think the biggest difference is that when you are a chef, you mostly focus on working in the kitchen. When you are a business owner, you are more focused on growing your business and the demands of your clients, and especially building a culture of your business. When you are a chef in the kitchen, people always look up to you and they always follow your lead. When you are a business owner, you have more things that you don\u2019t deal with when you are a chef. So building a culture is really having a philosophy on how to deal with things. For example, when we first had the line outside the bakery, it was very important for me to decide to sell to them and to acknowledge that they were here. So in the morning right now, we pass [out] hot chocolate, fresh baked mini-madeleines, hand-warmers. It\u2019s very important for me to keep focusing on my customers as soon as they get to us, not just when they walk into the shop. It\u2019s not something that a chef would necessarily think about. But as a business owner, you have to take that into consideration. I saw that on Valentine\u2019s day you passed out roses to people waiting in line. That\u2019s another example. I like to be close to my customers. They thought of coming early on the cold day [and] I want to make sure they have at least something nice, something sweet from us, just to let them know that we know they are there. It\u2019s cold and I really want to take good care of them. I also saw you tweet some wishes from your wishing tree. Were you flattered by some of those? Yea. We did a wishing tree for valentine\u2019s day that we left here inside the bakery and we invited people to just write a wish and put it on the tree. Actually, a lot of people played along and we had some sweet ones. Many of them wished for a cronut, a product that you recently trademarked. Was that an important decision for you to make? This is one of those decisions that you make as a business owner, not as a chef. The trademark of the cronut was a very important decision for us. [The trademark application] was a suggestions from a lawyer that cares for us and she suggested this to protect us. As a chef, you don\u2019t really know if you need to do this. We really quickly realized that a lot of small business owners are just bullied by [bigger companies]. If you don\u2019t protect your trademark, they will try to register the name before you do and they will stop you from using your creation. Kind of like patent trolls. Exactly. It\u2019s really important for me as a small business owner to stand up and say \u2018I am going to protect my trademark.\u2019 This is my creation and I am going to protect it so that I can ensure I can continue making it. I found it very interesting that when people ask you why don\u2019t you just make more cronuts, you\u2019ve said \u201cYou don\u2019t go to a doctor and tell him to make more surgeries.\u201d You emphasize quality over quantity. Is that part of your philosophy? It\u2019s the same reason that you don\u2019t ask writer to write four times more articles. I want to control the quality of the product. I want to sell people a good quality product for a fair price. A lot of people also ask me, why don\u2019t you sell out to a big factory and make tons of money? But this isn\u2019t about money. This is what we believe in. It\u2019s not about making tons and trying to sell as many as you can. It\u2019s about making a very good, very high-end quality product and giving people the best experience. It\u2019s not about raising the price for cronuts or selling it for twice more. Would they still sell out? Probably yes. But I don\u2019t want to treat my customers like that. I want them to have a fair price for a fair product. This is what I believe in. Some people say \u201cWell, what else can you do with a pastry business?\u201d You\u2019ve proven that there is room for innovation and creativity. And you have previously mentioned that you have many more ideas. Why is it so important to stay creative? I think it\u2019s the same for every field. Knowing that you did something well, it\u2019s not enough for this world. For example, if Van Gogh had only painted one painting and stopped there, no one would know about him. You start a new trend, you really explore your field and you go beyond what you know and what can be done. Beyond what people think can be done. There\u2019s no limit if you are creative, flexible and have imagination. It\u2019s just a matter of really understanding your customer and understanding what they are looking for. We see it here at the bakery a lot. For example, in the beginning, I made a point to change the menu every six to eight weeks, which is very unusual for a bakery. People would change a menu once, twice a year. We change it very often, as often as a restaurant. In the beginning, people were coming back and were sad not to find the pastries that they saw a month or so ago. But now people come back and they are excited about new items and they are excited about change. They bring new friends, they bring family here. There is this energy, this willingness to stay open minded and learn about new things that New York has. It\u2019s really an exciting place for a chef to be. In our earlier email correspondence, you told me \u201cNever get lazy and let your creation kill your creativity.\u201d Do you also encourage your staff to be creative? Totally. Yeah. It\u2019s very important for me. It\u2019s part of our culture. I always say I don\u2019t want the creation to kill the creativity. A creation \u2013 one of them was a cronut \u2013 I don\u2019t want us to stop yet and kill our creativity. We can do a lot more. We can do so many more things and it\u2019s very important for me to have my staff involved in this aspect so I always push them to think out of the box, to think differently. Because they also have ideas. Because they also have different experience and sharing and seeing my staff growing with me, it\u2019s something that is very unique and amazing for me. You previously helped expand Fauchon into places like Russia, Egypt \u2026 \u2026 Kuwait \u2026 What have you learned from that? Was it different than setting up your own business? I learned a lot. I\u2019ve learned all the things you should and shouldn\u2019t do. Fauchon\u2019s concept overseas was really copy-and-paste, it was a replica of what it was in Paris, which [in] some places works very well, and [in] some others, not at all. I think for me, it\u2019s very important for business to have a mindful growth but to also understand the market. If I were to open a place, a bakery a block away, it would have to be different. It would have to fit to the neighborhood, to have its own identity and personality. As a business owner you really adapt your concept, your ideas, your product, your service based on the location and your customers. This is one of the most important things I have learned with Fauchon. When you first came up with the cronut \u2013 there was a lot of attention. How did you feel about all of that attention? At first, it was a little bit overwhelming. You know it\u2019s not something that we were expecting. The first day that we launched cronut, someone from Grub Streeet came here and took a photo of it and posted it. It was a small article, just like a write-up of something new that we were doing because we always do something new. The same night, they called us and they told us they had increase of traffic of 300%. They technically told us they had never seen anything like this and that we should be ready to get busy. The first day I made maybe like 35? The second day, I decided to make 50. The first day we sold out in about 15 minutes. The second day in 10. And by the third day, we had a line of about 100 people waiting outside before work by the doors. And that\u2019s how the crazy began. I was really shocked. And we were not ready [laughs] to have a line of people outside the shop. We had very busy lines in the morning before the cronut, but not that amount of people coming for one product. It was something really unexpected. This was all word-of-mouth advertising. People often ask, \u2018Was it a PR strategy?\u2019 And we are like \u2018No, not at all\u2019. There is no PR strategy, there is no PR team, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s planned. We do things naturally. I do things that are genuine, with my heart and when I decide to buy few dozen roses to give to our first few customers in line, it\u2019s because I believe that it\u2019s a special day for them. And if I can make it a little more special for them and happier for them, I will do it. [In the morning], the most exciting part is really being at the register and see people leave the shop, saying goodbye to each other after standing on the line together. They spend time together. They exchange emails. They exchange phone numbers. You could start a cronut match-making service. [Laughs] They really become friends. It doesn\u2019t matter where they are from, which part of the world, what part of the city they are from. They talk and befriend each other. Do you have friends and family ask you for a cronut? Not all of them, because they know I don\u2019t make exceptions. They would have to get on the line. Most of them, friends and family, have actually never tried a cronut. I\u2019ve made rules since the very beginning and I have to stand by them. Everyone, all of my close friends and family, knows that they shouldn\u2019t ask me. My answer would be the same as for everyone: they should wait in the line. That\u2019s something I believe in, fairness for everyone. Good quality product for a fair price and everyone being treated equally. You had a special Valentine\u2019s Day menu. How did it go? It was amazing. That was our busiest day so far. And it was also last year. This year we have done everything in pink and we had \u2013 and this is very funny \u2013 most of our clients are actually gentlemen. Really? Yes, for Valentine\u2019s Day. For that day, we would see a good 80% of customers that are men. And when they walk into the shop with the hearts, and the cases are all pink, and we\u2019re playing love songs, and there are rose petals all over the floor, it\u2019s all very feminine. It\u2019s not a place where you would expect men to be, but they are all very smiley, and a little bit shy and they ask about recommendations. Well, I guess they have figured out what women have known all along: that the way to the heart is through the stomach. You got it. Do you feel that French have different relationship with food than Americans? Completely. Yes. [laughs] How different would you say they were? There\u2019s a lot more tradition and roots and history [in France]. France is a little bit more conservative when it comes to food. They know what they like and they like what they know. They don\u2019t like change too much. They like the things they have tasted before. They like French food. New Yorkers, Americans are completely different. They are a lot more open-minded. They travel a lot more. They are willing to discover new flavors, new textures and just new things from all over the world. That\u2019s why I think New York is one of the most exciting food scenes in the world today. And I firmly believe this, because I\u2019ve had some of my best meals ever in New York. So what\u2019s next for your bakery? Well, right now I am writing a book, a cookbook with Simon &amp; Schuster to come out in October of this year. So that\u2019s what\u2019s right now. And then when it comes to expansion \u2013 any healthy and safe business should expand. It should be a mindful growth and it should take into consideration, as I said earlier, the place, the location, the customers, the concept. To me, it\u2019s not just opening something. There should be something really unique and special about it, something that has a heart, something that people believe in.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke has again reduced UK supermarket openings as he diverts company cash into price cuts and facelifts for existing stores. Clarke told investors that Tesco would open only 700,000 sq ft (65,000 sq metres) of new space in the coming year \u2013 half the 1.4m sq ft laid down this year. It is a dramatic reduction from the height of the supermarket space race, when it planted 2.5m sq ft of new aisles in a single year, and a sign of the change under way in UK shopping habits. Customers now spend less time and money in big stores and more online and in convenience stores. Tesco used its meeting with analysts and investors to drop one of Clarke's big pledges \u2013 a profit margin target of 5.2% which, despite its recent problems, remained the highest in the industry. Finance director Laurie McIlwee stopped short of spelling it out but in front of a slide carrying the bullet point \"\u00a3 not % is the measure of margin success\" he said in the future \"cash not percentage margin would define our success\". Getting rid of the target in effect signals a willingness to make less profit on its sales as it tries to win back disgruntled shoppers with price cuts and promotions. Analysts have trimmed their profit forecasts for this year with trading profits of \u00a33.3bn pencilled in compared with \u00a33.5bn in 2012-13. Clarke conceded the headline numbers were \"not where we want them to be\" and that he had not moved fast enough. \"I have never seen such a pace of change in my 40 years at Tesco,\" he said. \"We didn't change enough \u2013 not enough for our customers at least.\" Analysts had argued that the margin figure was a \"straitjacket\" at a time when its prices were out of kilter with the competition. To that end Tesco announced a \u00a3200m price cuts scheme focused on staple groceries. \"Our prices must get better and be more stable,\" said Clarke. Asda immediately responded with its own \u00a3100m of price cuts. Clarke has tried price cuts to win back customers before \u2013 its \u00a3500m Price Drop campaign in 2011. On Tuesday he said that campaign \"wasn't executed particularly well\" Clarke, a Tesco lifer, is two years into a \u00a31bn turnaround plan for the UK chain, with store refurbishments, extra staff on the shop floor and promotions. To date Tesco has refurbished 615 of its near 2,600 UK estate and has promised to spend \u00a3500m a year for the next three years to finish the job by 2017. Clarke said: \"We have spent the last two years strengthening the foundations of our business. There was a lot to do.\" Clarke added that he was trying to improve pricing, quality and service, but that it was \"taking more time than we thought it would\". The initiatives failed to win over shoppers at Christmas with like-for-like sales down 2.4% in the six weeks to 4 January. Clarke slammed the brakes on the group's physical expansion two years ago when it became clear the growing popularity of online and convenience stores threatened to turn its more than 200 out-of-town hypermarkets into white elephants. Over many years it had amassed a vast land bank to build stores, but the about-turn in shoppers' habits forced it to write down its value by \u00a3800m last year, in effect admitting it would never build on many of the sites. Heralding an era of more conservative physical growth, the chain told investors that its annual capital expenditure would not exceed \u00a32.5bn for the next three years. Last year it spent \u00a33bn \u2013 which was down sharply from a high of \u00a36.6bn in 2008. Like other supermarket groups, Tesco's biggest stores have fast become millstones. Clarke has been trying to make Tesco's sprawling Extra stores more attractive by introducing restaurants \u2013 it bought the Giraffe chain for \u00a349m in 2013 \u2013 as well as soft play areas and even nail bars. After a series of trials around the country Clarke said Tesco had now come up with a winning formula for its big stores and these ideas would be introduced across the chain. Tesco will continue to expand its convenience chain Tesco Express at a rate of 150 stores a year. The other main focus is its website, where plans include subscription services and one-hour home delivery slots for time-poor shoppers. Clarke is concentrating on the UK chain which, given it generates two-thirds of Tesco's profits, underpins its success. To that end he has struck a series of deals to eliminate distraction caused by problem businesses in Japan, the US and China. At the start of this week Tesco confirmed it was seeking to restructure its struggling Turkish chain Kipa. In a statement to the Istanbul stock exchange, it said it was \"in talks with various companies regarding various options\". Tesco shares, 400p when Clarke took over the top job in March 2011, closed up 1.8p at 335p. Bryan Roberts at Kantar Retail said Tesco had made some \"reassuring noises\", but he added: \"Simply lowering prices will not be enough to counter the steady advance of the discounters. One of the reasons that Aldi is thriving [is] economy of time and complexity. Shoppers don't just want cheap, they also want quick and easy. \"Secondly, the fact that most retailers price-match each other means that price is increasingly irrelevant within the supermarket industry. This means that differentiation through quality and service is more important than ever \u2013 and I'm not sure that today's revelations mean that Tesco is significantly closer to achieving that.\"",

But King said he still had \"no idea\" what he was going to do when he leaves the company this summer, appearing to suggest his son was a more likely new recruit for motorsport's Formula 1, where he is widely rumoured to be set to replace current boss Bernie Ecclestone. He said: \"There's no vacancy. My interest in motorsport is because my son is a fantastic racing driver, he is the British Formula 3 Champion and I am proud of his achievement. If he reaches Formula 1 that would be my proudest moment.\" The former Mars, Asda and Marks &amp; Spencer executive repeated his assertion that he wanted \"one more big job\" but appeared to give himself a broad sweep: \"My background is at public companies at Sainsbury's and in food more widely, I've worked for retailers and manufacturers and I'm sure there are other opportunities out there.\"",

But the unusual (for the renminbi) scale of the decline may also signal a broader shift in policy stance.</p> <p>Over the past few years, with the renminbi widely seen as undervalued, China\u2019s primary line of defence against speculative inflows has been its capital controls. Recently though, the PBC has come to the view that the renminbi is close to its \u201cfair\u201d market value. It believes in turn that a key constraint on opening up the capital account has been lifted. The main remaining barrier, in the PBC\u2019s eyes, is the engrained (but, it feels, unjustified) market expectation that the renminbi will appreciate which fuels speculative inflows. A period of greater market volatility lies ahead as the PBC attempts to reset that view.</p> <p>Whether this works will depend ultimately on whether speculative flows are the main remaining source of upward pressure on the renminbi. We don\u2019t think they are. China\u2019s current account surplus remains large and looks likely to grow. The healthy returns on funds invested in China are still attracting more capital to the country than is going overseas. As a result, we continue to expect further exchange rate appreciation this year along with substantial foreign exchange accumulation. But investors should be prepared for greater volatility along the way.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>However, Alphaville\u2019s Izabella Kaminsk</b>a has another theory: that Chinese firms had, until recently, been trying to make a quick profit by borrowing US dollars, converting it into yuan, buying domestic debt, and planning to cash in by reversing the trade once the yuan had strengthened, as seemed inevitable.</p> <p>That trade could now be unravelling, she suggests, if there simply aren\u2019t enough US dollars available (as capital flows back to the US).</p> <p>More here: <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2014/02/25/1781252/the-curious-incident-of-the-pboc-in-the-usdcny-market/\">The curious incident of the PBOC in the USDCNY market</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-530cc42be4b06ed6ded17bca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-25T16:33:51.147Z\">4.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Open Europe thinktank has published <a href=\"http://www.openeuropeblog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/the-european-commissions-new-economic.html\">a research note </a>on today\u2019s EC winter forecasts.</p> <p>Here\u2019s some highlights:</p> <h2><b>Inflation forecast cut</b></h2>A metric which everyone is watching at the moment is inflation. As we have discussed before, March has been pegged as a key meeting for the ECB and is expected to be a defining choice over whether the bank takes more action to tackle inflation. The EC has cut its forecast for inflation from 1.5% to 1.1% for this year while last year\u2019s has been revised to 1.3% from 1.5%. Despite the language being quite strong on inflation remaining low and subdued, these forecasts <a href=\"http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/prices/indic/forecast/html/table_hist_hicp.en.html\">aren\u2019t far from the ECB\u2019s own</a> and are unlikely to push them one way or another when it comes to taking further action. The graph also highlights that the view of core inflation (without energy or food prices) been on a slow decline for some time but is expected to melt upwards over the coming years. Again this fits with current ECB thinking rather than bucking against it.  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-86786f2e-9339-4554-8c39-46ff183bb28c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/25/1393345711913/2ae6889d-6c87-4408-8e21-855d1dddf551-460x372.png\" alt=\"EC inflation forecast, Winter 2013/14\" width=\"460\" height=\"372\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: EC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><b>Spain and Italy \u2013 diverging forecasts, but plenty of common problems</b></h2> <p>One of the more surprising points is that Spain has got the most substantial upgrade of all the big eurozone countries \u2013 with its 2014 growth forecast raised from +0.5% to +1%. At the same time Italy is the only big eurozone country whose growth forecast for this year has been revised downwards \u2013 from +0.7% to +0.6%.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s all for today. A quick reminder of the key points. The EC has raised its growth forecasts for the eurozone this year, but warned that inflation will be significantly below the ECB\u2019s target in 2014 and 2015. Highlights start here. It now expects the UK to grow faster too -- by 2.5% this year. Vice-president Olli Rehn said a modest recovery was underway, but joblessness was still too high. Fears over a clampdown on bank lending in China sent mining stocks falling in London, knocking 0.5% off the FTSE 100. Earlier the Shanghai stock market had suffered its biggest fall in seven months. The Chinese yuan has weakened, fuelling speculation that the country\u2019s central bank is preparing the ground for fresh reforms next week. In the UK, retail sales staged a recovery. While mortgage lending rallied, while business lending fell again. And the world of Bitcoin is in crisis after a major exchange vanished -- and here\u2019s some analysis. Back tomorrow. Thanks and goodnight. GW The FTSE 100\u2019s assault on its 1999 record high will have to wait another day, with the blue chip index finishing down 35 points at 6830, down over 0.5%. Mining stocks were hit by fears of more turbulence in China (see earlier in the blog), with several major resource companies falling at least 2%. Alastair McCaig, Market Analyst, IG, sums it up: The index has given back almost all of the ground it made yesterday when it climbed towards its highest close for 13 years, as the heady highs of 1999 appear to have been too much for most traders. Here\u2019s the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100: Other European markets closed pretty flat, with the German DAX and French CAC each dropping 0.1%, the Italian FTSE MIB down a whisker at 0.01%. Spain\u2019s IBEX jumped 0.5%. Over in Cyprus, striking electricity workers have reportedly caused power outages today in protest at plans to privatise the country\u2019s power utility firm. More here. Great post from Alex Hern, one of our technology reporters, on how the Mt.Gox bitcoin exchange was brought down - and what the crypo-currency needs to do now to survive: Mt.Gox v Fort Knox: What happens when a bitcoin exchange collapses Today\u2019s EC growth forecasts have been hailed by our friends at the Daily Telegraph, as they show the UK growing rather faster than major European rivals. The EC now expects UK GDP to rise by 2.5% this year, up from 2.2% -- much stronger than Germany\u2019s forecast of 1.8%, or France\u2019s 1.0% (see earlier in the blog for full details). Szu Ping Chan writes: Despite signs of a broader and \u201cstronger\u201d recovery, the Commission warned growth would remain reliant on private consumption, which could \u201cdecline sizeably\u201d if eventual interest rate rises force more borrowers to curb spending to pay off their loans. \u201cGrowth is likely to continue to come almost exclusively from domestic demand ... and investment playing a more important role as time progresses,\u201d the Commission said. \u201c[However] the upturn in investment may fail to materialise and private consumption may decline sizeably, as a result of continued weak wage growth, interest rate rises or the household debt burden weighing down on spending.\u201d More here. Economist Paul De Grauwe suggests we shouldn\u2019t read too much into today\u2019s EC forecasts.... Or \u2018revised\u2019, in economics lingo. Mark Williams of Capital Economics argues that the surprise weakness of the Chinese renminbi in recent days shows that its central bank is plotting something: The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) has engineered an abrupt fall in the renminbi over the past week or so (see chart above). Its immediate aim appears to be to shift market expectations of continued, steady appreciation against the dollar. But the unusual (for the renminbi) scale of the decline may also signal a broader shift in policy stance. Over the past few years, with the renminbi widely seen as undervalued, China\u2019s primary line of defence against speculative inflows has been its capital controls. Recently though, the PBC has come to the view that the renminbi is close to its \u201cfair\u201d market value. It believes in turn that a key constraint on opening up the capital account has been lifted. The main remaining barrier, in the PBC\u2019s eyes, is the engrained (but, it feels, unjustified) market expectation that the renminbi will appreciate which fuels speculative inflows. A period of greater market volatility lies ahead as the PBC attempts to reset that view. Whether this works will depend ultimately on whether speculative flows are the main remaining source of upward pressure on the renminbi. We don\u2019t think they are. China\u2019s current account surplus remains large and looks likely to grow. The healthy returns on funds invested in China are still attracting more capital to the country than is going overseas. As a result, we continue to expect further exchange rate appreciation this year along with substantial foreign exchange accumulation. But investors should be prepared for greater volatility along the way. However, Alphaville\u2019s Izabella Kaminska has another theory: that Chinese firms had, until recently, been trying to make a quick profit by borrowing US dollars, converting it into yuan, buying domestic debt, and planning to cash in by reversing the trade once the yuan had strengthened, as seemed inevitable. That trade could now be unravelling, she suggests, if there simply aren\u2019t enough US dollars available (as capital flows back to the US). More here: The curious incident of the PBOC in the USDCNY market The Open Europe thinktank has published a research note on today\u2019s EC winter forecasts. Here\u2019s some highlights: Inflation forecast cutA metric which everyone is watching at the moment is inflation. As we have discussed before, March has been pegged as a key meeting for the ECB and is expected to be a defining choice over whether the bank takes more action to tackle inflation. The EC has cut its forecast for inflation from 1.5% to 1.1% for this year while last year\u2019s has been revised to 1.3% from 1.5%. Despite the language being quite strong on inflation remaining low and subdued, these forecasts aren\u2019t far from the ECB\u2019s own and are unlikely to push them one way or another when it comes to taking further action. The graph also highlights that the view of core inflation (without energy or food prices) been on a slow decline for some time but is expected to melt upwards over the coming years. Again this fits with current ECB thinking rather than bucking against it. Spain and Italy \u2013 diverging forecasts, but plenty of common problems One of the more surprising points is that Spain has got the most substantial upgrade of all the big eurozone countries \u2013 with its 2014 growth forecast raised from +0.5% to +1%. At the same time Italy is the only big eurozone country whose growth forecast for this year has been revised downwards \u2013 from +0.7% to +0.6%. Similarly, on the unemployment side (while Spain remains in a much worse position) the forecast has improved somewhat for Spain and worsened for Italy. In any case, both continue to struggle with their large debt loads (more below), although new Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi might take the less than optimistic forecast as an important reminder of the reforms he needs to pursue, not unlike the ones Spain has undertaken\u2026 Debt remains a problem in the eurozone By 2015, seven eurozone countries are forecast to have public debt levels above 100% of GDP \u2013 Belgium, Ireland, Cyprus, Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal. As the report warns, this debt overhang could become a drag on medium term growth, particularly when combined with other factors such as the knock on effects of years of depressed investment, high unemployment and falling productivity. The full note is here: The European Commission\u2019s new economic forecasts: Fragile recovery continues, but problems remain The FTSE 100 is still in the red as trading comes towards a close, down 35 points or 0.5% at 6811. Mining stocks continue to drag the market down, as investors fear a sharp slowdown in China as banking lending is tightened. Fresnillo is down 3.2%, followed by Rio Tinto (-2.8%), Anglo American (-2.3%) and Antofagasta (-2.2%). Michael Hewson of CMC Markets blames the selloff on the surprise drop in the yuan today, which many analysts believe means the People\u2019s Bank of China is softening up the markets for new economic reforms next week. He writes: Nothing sums up the fickle nature of equity markets more than today\u2019s market reaction to the very same events that we knew about yesterday morning, and the concerns being expressed about Chinese bank lending and possible future steps that Chinese authorities might take in seeking to take some of the heat out of the property market. The catalyst on this occasion appears to have been further sharp falls in the Chinese currency while Chinese stock markets dropped back near to multi month lows. Wall Street, though, is pretty flat. Hewson again: While European markets appear to have taken fright from the dive in Chinese markets it would appear that US markets are much less concerned opening slightly lower after the record highs posted on the S&amp;P500 yesterday. Stocks in focus include JP Morgan who announced that they would be cutting thousands of more jobs in addition to the 13,000 already announced due to plunging demand for home loans, which raises concerns about the longer term health of the US housing market. Also in focus DIY retailer Home Depot opened higher after their latest earnings report beat market expectations, coming in at $0.73c a share, though we could well see any gains tempered by the fact that the outlook for 2014 was adjusted lower. LSE student and economic history ace Simon Hinrichsen tweets a couple of interesting charts on the possibility of Ukraine defaulting, from Japanese bank Nomura. Ever wondered how long you\u2019d have to toil at the coal face until you\u2019ve earned as much as a top banker? Well, now you can find out. My colleague Chris Fenn has taken HSBC\u2019s latest financial results, from yesterday, and put the salaries of its eight most highly-paid staff into context: It\u2019s here: How long would you have to work to earn a banker\u2019s yearly wage? I\u2019ve popped the average UK salary in, as an example: Lots more Tesco convenience stores, coming to high streets near you.... The supermarket chain has been briefing analysts on its new strategy (see 12.23pm) - and promised an extra \u00a3200m on price cuts in the UK: Wall Street is open, and the main indices are down in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has lost 52 points, or 0.3%, to 16154. The S&amp;P 500, which hit an all-time high yesterday, has dropped 1.8 points or 0.1% to 1845. Ramin Nakisa, a global macro strategist at UBS, sounds confident that the US market will be benefit from turbulence in the emerging markets, telling Reuters that: \u201cWe think there will be further flows into the U.S. as the Fed cuts back on its stimulus. \u201cIf you could earn 3-3.5 percent on U.S. Treasuries for example would you risk money in volatile emerging market debt for a small premium.\u201d US Treasuries (government debt) have risen in value, pushing the yield (interest rate) on 10-year bonds down to 2.70% from 2.74% yesterday. Over to America, where the S&amp;P/Case Shiller index shows that house prices in 20 US metro areas rose by 0.8% in December, on a seasonally adjusted basis. That\u2019s a faster rate than analysts expected, but a slight slowdown compared with November\u2019s 0.9% growth. Annually, prices were up 13.4% compared with a year ago -- the best December reading in eight years. David M. Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, cautioned that the housing recovery may be slowing: The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index ended its best year since 2005... However, gains are slowing from month-to-month and the strongest part of the recovery in home values may be over. Luke Baker, Reuters\u2019 top man in Brussels, explains why the EC supports a donors\u2019 conference for Ukraine: Here\u2019s the top line from EC vice-president Olli Rehn today, arguing the eurozone recovery is gathering pace: Recovery is gaining ground in Europe, following the return to growth in the middle of last year. The strengthening of domestic demand this year should help us to achieve more balanced and sustainable growth. Rebalancing of the European economy has been progressing and external competitiveness is improving, particularly in the most vulnerable countries. The worst of the crisis may now be behind us, but this is not an invitation to be complacent, as the recovery is still modest. To make the recovery stronger and create more jobs, we need to stay the course of economic reform. And today\u2019s winter forecasts (see here onwards) also shows that government deficits are expected to keep falling -- to 2.7% of GDP in the EU and 2.6% in the euro area. That will push total debt-to-GDP ratios to almost 90% in the EU and 96% in the euro area. The final question at the EC winter forecasts press conference was on the Ukraine crisis. Olli Rehn said the Commisison was in close contact with the IMF on the issue. He said Kiev will need short-term funding help, and longer-term financial aid to fund economic reforms and recovery. Rehn added that he would support the idea of a \u2018donors\u2019 conference\u2019 for Ukraine, where EU member states with the most resources could agree contributions to help Ukraine. He pointed out that most of the EU\u2019s resources in an issue such as this reside with its member states (as there isn\u2019t a particular EU budget or pool of money to tap). The new EC economic forecasts are online here: It includes a nifty interactive map to show you the latest projections for each country. Olli Rehn also told reporters that the EC has \u201cno news\u201d for them regarding any changes to Italy\u2019s deficit reduction goals. On Italy, Olli Rehn says he\u2019s confident that the new government, led by Matteo Renzi, will continue to implement the economic policies needed to tackle Italy\u2019s debts, stimulate growth, and \u201cunleash the country\u2019s great economic potential\u201d. Olli Rehn says that the EC raised its growth forecast for Spain today, from 0.5% to 1%, because it sees \u201cimproved confidence\u201d and \u201csome easing of financing conditions\u201d. The EC also expects to see Spanish employment rising this year, as recent labour reforms kick in. Rehn said (livestream): The [Spanish] labour market outlook is somewhat better than expected in the autumn. Rehn is also arguing that future austerity programmes should have a stronger focus on government spending cuts, rather than tax rises: The European Commission has raised its forecast for eurozone growth this year, but also slashed its inflation forecast and warned that debt levels in several countries will continue to climb. In its new Winter forecasts, the EC predicts that eurozone GDP will grow by 1.2% this year - up from 1.1% before, rising to 1.8% in 2015. In a hat-tip to Madrid, the EC has doubled its growth forecast for Spain to +1.0% this year. But it also sees a deep downturn in Cyprus, which is expected to slump by another 4.8% this year. And it expects to see deficits over the 3% target in Portugal, Spain and France this year. Commissioner Olli Rehn is presenting the report now - here\u2019s a weblink. Rehn began by saying that a fragile recovery was underway in the eurozone. Financial markets were showing more confidence in vulnerable members of the eurozone, pointing out that the \u2018spread\u2019 between their borrowing cost and stronger core countries had narrowed (well done, Mario!). Here\u2019s the main bullet points from the winter forecasts : EU COMMISSION FORECASTS GERMAN GDP GROWTH AT 1.8 PCT IN 2014, 2.0 PCT IN 2015 EU COMMISSION FORECASTS FRENCH GDP GROWTH AT 1.0 PCT IN 2014, 1.7 PCT IN 2015 EU COMMISSION FORECASTS ITALIAN GDP GROWTH AT 0.6 PCT IN 2014, 1.2 PCT IN 2015 EU COMMISSION FORECASTS SPANISH GDP GROWTH AT 1.0 PCT IN 2014, 1.7 PCT IN 2015 EU COMMISSION FORECASTS GREEK GDP GROWTH AT 0.6 PCT IN 2014, 2.9 PCT IN 2015 EU COMMISSION FORECASTS PORTUGAL GDP GROWTH AT 0.8 PCT IN 2014, 1.5 PCT IN 2015 EU COMMISSION FORECASTS CYPRUS GDP GROWTH AT -4.8 PCT IN 2014, 0.9 PCT IN 2015 EU COMMISSION FORECASTS SPANISH DEFICIT AT -5.8 PCT IN 2014, -6.5 PCT IN 2015 EU COMMISSION FORECASTS FRENCH DEFICIT AT -4.0 PCT IN 2014, -3.9 PCT IN 2015 EU COMMISSION FORECASTS GREEK DEFICIT AT -2.2 PCT IN 2014, -1.0 PCT IN 2015 EU COMMISSION FORECASTS PORTUGUESE DEFICIT AT -4.0 PCT IN 2014, -2.5 PCT IN 2015 EU COMMISSION FORECASTS ITALIAN DEFICIT AT -2.6 PCT IN 2014, -2.2 PCT IN 2015 EU COMMISSION FORECASTS CYPRUS DEFICIT AT -5.8 PCT IN 2014, -6.1 PCT IN 2015 And here\u2019s some early reaction: Supermarket chain Tesco has announced that it will cut spending on new stores, and focus on internet shopping and small convenience shops. The plan, being outlined to analysts in the City today, is an attempt to reshape its fortunes after struggling against discount supermarket chains. Curiously, the announcement also talks about the importance of \u201cputting the customer first\u201d - which inevitably makes one ponder where the humble shopper was ranked before. Anyway, here\u2019s the key points: Reflecting its strategic priorities, the Group\u2019s capital expenditure will be even more focused on online and convenience growth and on an accelerated refresh programme for its larger stores. Consistent with its rigorous approach to capital discipline, Tesco will describe a further significant reduction in planned net new space growth, with the result that Group capital expenditure will be reduced to no more than \u00a32.5bn per year for at least the next three financial years. Tesco will describe to investors how \u2018Winning in the new era of retail\u2019 is about putting the customer first and how by delivering the most compelling offer across all channels, it is focusing on increasing loyalty and improving sales, leading to sustainable profits and returns over the medium term, consistent with its financial guiderails. Guiderails?.... Gathering concerns over China\u2019s economy have hit the London stock market today, pushing the blue-chip Footsie index down from yesterday\u2019s 14-year closing high. After a lacklustre morning\u2019s trading the FTSE 100 is down 61 points, or 0.9%, at 6804 as noon approaches -- dampening talk that it could hit a new all-time record high soon. Mining firms led the fallers, dented by the news that the Shanghai composite index had recorded its biggest fall in seven months (see 8.25am for details). Rio Tinto and Anglo American are both down over 3%, on speculation that the Chinese property market is heading for a fall. Monday\u2019s rally had led to speculation that the FTSE 100 could breach its previous closing high of 6930 (set at the end of 1999) -- or even hit 7,000 for the first time. China is causing the damage. Data released yesterday showed a surprise slowdown in Chinese house price growth, as banks curb their lending as Beijing looks to tighten credit. Today there is alarm that its currency, the yuan, has weakened; good for exporters, but possibly a sign of concern that the domestic economy is weakening. Toby Morris, senior sales trader at CMC Markets, said the rout on the Shanghai stock market was weighing on UK shares: After yesterday\u2019s rampant close, UK markets have started the day on the back foot after Chinese stocks slumped overnight, with concerns over a cooling property market and lending curbs hampering consumer growth spilling over to the second trading day of the week. As with any Chinese story the miners lead declines, sending the FTSE\u2019s basic materials sector over 2% lower and leaving the benchmark lagging behind its European peers. Joao Monteiro, analyst at Monex Capital Markets, said traders fear further steep losses in China: Shanghai recorded its worst day in seven months with the composite index dropping by over 2% as fears are heightened that a collapse in the property bubble is getting ever closer. It\u2019s been property development companies that have borne the brunt of the sell-off, but the real fear is that any slowdown in the property market will be felt across the board with consumption of everything from small electronics to cars likely to suffer. This chart from the Wall Street Journal shows how the Chinese yuan, usually tightly controlled, has weakened in recent days. Analysts believe it shows Beijing is preparing to announce new economic reforms, and perhaps tighter lending rules, next week. That\u2019s bad news for traders who had piled into the yuan, confident that it would continue to rise in value against the US dollar as Beijing relaxed controls. The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has sent its currency sliding to its weakest ever level against the US dollar: 25-Feb-2014 11:14 - UKRAINE\u2019S HRYVNIA HITS ALL-TIME LOW OF 9.70 AGAINST U.S. DOLLAR The slide came as Ukrainian politicians struggled to form a new government, following the overthrow of former president Viktor Yanukovych. The parliament\u2019s speaker said a new administration would not be formed before Thursday; there had been hopes of agreement today. Earlier, EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton expressed \u201cstrong support\u201d for the politicians now controlling Ukraine. Overnight, US officials indicated that the International Monetary Fund could lead an aid package as high as $15bn to help stabilise a new, transitional government in Kiev (full story here). Shares had spiked on the Ukrainian stock market yesterday on hopes that the situation was improving, but the main index is down 1% today. Just in -- UK retailers have reported that sales jumped at their fastest rate since June 2012. The CBI distributive trades survey (which interviews 120 firms) found that 45% reported that sales volumes were up on a year ago, while 8% said they were down. That sent the net balance soaring to +37, up from +15 in January. It suggests retail sales picked up in early February after poor weather kept shoppers off the streets a month ago, and as cash-strapped consumers cut back after Christmas. Grocers, clothing and furniture &amp; carpet sellers were particularly upbeat. Barry Williams, Asda\u2019s chief merchandising officer for Food, said the figures show shoppers were still quite upbeat: \u201cThere is growth across many sectors, including grocers and clothing outlets, while investment intentions are at their highest for more than three years. Although we are by no means seeing a universally confident shopper, the positive indicators have perhaps given some people the urge to spend. \u201cOverall sales have been remarkably resilient in the face of disruption from the exceptional weather across the UK, which has badly affected many families and businesses.\u201d It\u2019s quite a contrast with Italy; figures released earlier today showed retail sales shrank by 2.1% during 2013 compared with 2012. UK mortgage approvals hit their highest level since September 2007 last month, but lending to businesses continues to decline. New data from the British Bankers Association showed that loans for new house purchases rose 57% annually in January to 49,972, a 76-month high. BBA statistics director, David Dooks explained: Following on from last month, mortgage borrowing continues to rise compared to a year earlier as mortgage assistance schemes help first time buyers and housing chains more generally. Approvals for new purchases have climbed quite significantly and are now at their highest point since September 2007. Credit card spending is also on the rise, showing that consumer confidence in the economy continues to improve. Credit card spending jumped 12.5% annually in January to \u00a38.4bn -- underlining how consumer spending has driven the recovery to date. However, it\u2019s a darker picture in business lending -- where borrowing by non-financial firms shrank by another \u00a3300m. Manufacturing is the only sector where lending actually rose compared to a year ago, as this graph shows: Bitcoin cynics may be unsurprised to learn that the Mt Gox exchange has dropped offline, and has reportedly lost hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins through a cybercrime attack. As Tokyo-based Mt Gox vanished from the web, a document swept through the Bitcoin world (online here) which claimed that the exchange had lost around 744,000 Bitcoins (around 6% of the amount currently in circulation) in a theft that hadn\u2019t been detected for several years. If true, such a loss could leave it facing insolvency. The Bitcoin price has tumbled sharply this morning, down around 20% at roughly $460. Mt Gox has been in turmoil for weeks, freezing withdrawals in January after reporting a flaw in its bitcoin wallet software. Mt Gox stands for \u201cMagic The Gathering Online Exchange\u201d; Matt O\u2019Brien of The Atlantic reckons the clue was in the name... And rival firms have issued their own joint statement, insisting that \u201cstrong Bitcoin companies, led by highly competent teams and backed by credible investors\u201d have a bright future. Germany has also posted a small budget surplus for the second year running. The Federal Statistics Office reported that government revenues came in \u20ac300m higher than expenditure. Given the size of the German economy, this gives it a surplus/deficit of 0.0% -- down on last year\u2019s 0.1% surplus. Here\u2019s the details. ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski flags up that its the first time in 40-odd years that Germany has posted two consecutive surpluses. Confirmation this morning that Germany\u2019s economy continues to grow faster than the eurozone average, thanks to overseas demand for its goods. The Federal Statistics Office has confirmed that German GDO grew by 0.4% -- in line with the initial estimate a fortnight ago. Today\u2019s data showed that foreign trade adde 1.1% to GDOP, while domestic demand knocked off 0.7% -- perhaps indicating the German households are finding life harder. Fancy running a banknote printer? De La Rue is looking for a new chief executive, after Tim Cobbold handed in his notice to run marketing firm UBM instead. There\u2019s a bit more detail on fastFT. In the UK corporate world, housebuilder Persimmon has been revitalised by the recovery in the UK housing market. It reported a 49% jump in pre-tax profits - the top of market expectations -- and revealed that the volume of new houses under construction building jumped by 30% in the second half of 2013. Chairman Nicholas Wrigley said Persimmon was profiting from a recovery in consumer confidence, and the government\u2019s controversial mortgage subsidy scheme: Persimmon achieved a strong result for the year as we responded quickly to the increased customer demand that resulted from improved mortgage lending, the introduction of Help to Buy in April 2013 and the increase in consumer confidence as the UK returned to more meaningful economic growth. Shareholders are pleased -- Persimmon are up 1.3% this morning, bucking the trend. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 report on how the Chinese stock market had another bad day: China\u2019s CSI300 share index suffered its largest one-day loss in seven months on Tuesday, as prices dropped sharply in the afternoon on renewed credit worries and a sharp drop in the yuan. The Nasdaq-style ChiNext Composite Index of mostly high-tech start-ups listed in Shenzhen ended down 5.1% after touching an intra-day record high just shortly before the midday lunch break. The CSI300 of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings tumbled 2.6% in its biggest single-day loss since July 2013. The Shanghai Composite Index ended down 2% at 2,034.2 points. This was the fourth-straight day of losses for both major benchmark indexes, with investors jittery about lending curbs on the important property sector. China\u2019s spot yuan fell below the official midpoint rate for the first time since September 2012 on Tuesday, as economists and traders suspected the central bank had intervened to add volatility to the currency in preparation for reform. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Many world stock markets remain pretty buoyant today, with many close to their highest levels in years, but fears over the state of the Chinese banking sector and the strength of the global economy are lingering. Last night, the US S&amp;P 500 ended a whisker away from its record closing high, and Australia\u2019s ASX 200 index hit its highest level in five and a half-years overnight -- driven by banks and insurers -- before dropping back. In Europe, the London FTSE 100 has fallen in opening trading after hitting a 14-year closing high last night. The blue-chip index of leading shares is down 29 point at 6836, a drop of 0.4%, pushed down by mining stocks. This comes as City traders chatter that the Footsie could soon crash over the 7,000 point mark for the first time ever. The news overnight that Italian PM Mattei Renzi won his confidence vote in the Italian Senate, cementing his authority as leader, has helped boost optimism. Chris Weston of IG reckons that bullish traders have taken their cue from decent financial results, rather than fretting about what the world central banks will do: Global earnings have been good from all parts and this has been the key input, which of course should always be the case, as over the longer-term share prices should generally follow earnings and cash flows. With Japan\u2019s Nikkei jumping 1.4%, and the Korean market up nearly 0.9%, Asian markets were at their highest level in a month. However, China\u2019s stock market isn\u2019t sharing the good times -- the Shanghai index slid by 2% today amid concerns of a clampdown on bank lending . The Chinese yuan was also unusually volatile today, prompting speculation that the Chinese central bank had intervened to weaken the currency. Associated Press explains: A decline in China\u2019s tightly controlled currency prompted suggestions China\u2019s central bank might be trying to support exporters and help offset weakening domestic demand. That came after an HSBC Corp. survey showed Chinese manufacturing activity in February tumbled to a seven-month low. \u201cWe believe that the central bank will be accepting of some more weakness in coming days,\u201d said Credit Agricole CIB in a report. I\u2019ll be tracking the main events through the day....",

Retail analyst Nick Bubb said he had thought the mooted \u00a3225m valuation for McColl's was on the low side but that the market appeared underwhelmed. \"Maybe investors were more excited by the other retailing IPOs coming down the line,\" Bubb said. McColl's float on Friday will be the first retail IPO of 2014, a year when many retailers, including online seller Appliances Online hope to take advantage of booming stock markets and a revival in consumer confidence to raise cash in the market. Pets at Home and Poundland have also announced their intention to float soon. The McColl's float will raise \u00a3133m comprising an initial \u00a350m to pay off pricey debt and convert newsagents into food stores and a further \u00a383m when current shareholders sell parts of their stakes. On top of the 80% owned by Lancaster and other employees, 20% of the company is owned by Cavendish Square Partners. The fund contains a mixed bag of company stakes from HBOS's ill-starred foray into private equity. Cavendish is 30% owned by Lloyds Banking Group, which rescued HBOS during the financial crisis.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A Bank of England policymaker has reinforced expectations that the first rise in interest rates will come as soon as next spring, in remarks that pushed up the pound. Ian McCafferty, a member of the monetary policy committee, said that market expectations that the Bank of England will start to raise rates in the second quarter of 2015 are \"not unreasonable\". He told news agency Reuters in an interview that wage deals in coming months would be \"quite critical\" as policymakers watch for inflation risks. Under governor Mark Carney, earlier this month the Bank overhauled its forward guidance policy on when rates would rise from their record low of 0.5%. At the time it said a view in markets that rates could rise in the second quarter of 2015 was consistent with its goal of keeping inflation close to the government-set 2% target. McCafferty told Reuters: \"In that sense, you'd have to say that that market curve is not unreasonable. \"The exact timing of course is going to depend on events that have yet to unfold in terms of how the recovery proceeds over the course of the next six to 12 months or so.\" Following his remarks being published, the pound rose to session highs against the dollar and euro. McCafferty, a former chief economic adviser to business group CBI, said he was watching for pressures on inflation from pay deals negotiated in coming months. After years above its target inflation has now fallen below 2%, to stand at 1.9% in January. \"I suppose my view would be if anything, the risk I am watching for, because I think it fits with our mandate, is were we to see inflation risks or inflation behaviour start to develop,\" he said. \"At the moment, that seems to be well under control. \"If we did see some inflationary pressure \u2013 more than we currently expect in our central case \u2013 that would if anything, I suspect, lead the committee to consider slightly earlier rate rises.\" The policymaker said another factor to watch was the strength of the pound, which last week strengthened to a four-year high against the dollar. \"Were it to continue to rise, I would get more worried,\" McCafferty said, and indicated further strengthening could delay a rate hike. \"It's clearly a consideration in terms of total monetary conditions in the economy so we would need to take it into account when determining what the appropriate monetary stance would be going forward,\" he said.",

At the time it said a view in markets that rates could rise in the second quarter of 2015 was consistent with its goal of keeping inflation close to the government-set 2% target. McCafferty told Reuters: \"In that sense, you'd have to say that that market curve is not unreasonable.</p> <p>\"The exact timing of course is going to depend on events that have yet to unfold in terms of how the recovery proceeds over the course of the next six to 12 months or so.\"</p> <p>Following his remarks being published, the pound rose to session highs against the dollar and euro.</p> <p>McCafferty, a former chief economic adviser to business group CBI, said he was watching for pressures on inflation from pay deals negotiated in coming months. After years above its target <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/18/uk-inflation-falls-below-bank-england-target\" title=\"\">inflation has now fallen below 2%</a>, to stand at 1.9% in January.</p> <p>\"I suppose my view would be if anything, the risk I am watching for, because I think it fits with our mandate, is were we to see inflation risks or inflation behaviour start to develop,\" he said. \"At the moment, that seems to be well under control.</p> <p>\"If we did see some inflationary pressure \u2013 more than we currently expect in our central case \u2013 that would if anything, I suspect, lead the committee to consider slightly earlier rate rises.\"</p> <p>The policymaker said <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/02/25/uk-britain-boe-mcccafferty-sterling-idUKBREA1O0FU20140225\" title=\"\">another factor to watch was the strength of the pound</a>, which last week strengthened to a four-year high against the dollar.</p> <p>\"Were it to continue to rise, I would get more worried,\" McCafferty said, and indicated further strengthening could delay a rate hike.</p> <p>\"It's clearly a consideration in terms of total monetary conditions in the economy so we would need to take it into account when determining what the appropriate monetary stance would be going forward,\" he said.</p>",
