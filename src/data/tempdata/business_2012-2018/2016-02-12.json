      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland has waded into the debate over whether the UK should remain in the EU, saying that the uncertainty caused by the upcoming referendum could \u201cslow down banking\u201d. Ross McEwan, a New Zealander, who has not previously expressed a view on the referendum, told BBC2\u2019s Newsnight that the vote needed to be held as quickly as possible to end the uncertainty it was creating. McEwan told the BBC he had seen no \u201ceconomic data that suggests we\u2019d be better off out, in the short to medium term\u201d. \u201cThe issue we\u2019ve got is the uncertainty which slows businesses down, which will, over time, slow down banking so it\u2019s \u2026 really good that the government is trying to have the vote very quickly,\u201d said the boss of RBS, which is 73% owned by the taxpayer. McEwan\u2019s intervention came as a report published by economists at Deutsche Bank showed that the referendum was a risk to the share prices of banks, which have been highly volatile on the stock market this week, with the UK\u2019s index of bank shares falling at one point to a seven-year low. \u201cWe see the EU referendum as a risk for bank equity performance principally because of the uncertainty of the implications of Brexit for the outlook of the UK economy, and for the legal and regulatory framework of providing financial services into and out of the EU. A weaker UK economy in the event of Brexit would likely hit profitability thanks to looser monetary policy and credit losses,\u201d the Deutsche Bank economists said. \u201cFinancial market and global economic uncertainty have been key features of the first few weeks of 2016. One of the most important sources of uncertainty for the UK, however, revolves around a known event \u2013 the forthcoming referendum on EU membership, likely to be held this summer. While our baseline case is for the UK to vote to remain in the EU by a narrow majority, polls showing \u201cleave\u201d gaining ground highlight the risk.\u201d Before the last election, HSBC warned about the implications of leaving the EU as it embarked on a review of whether to keep its head office in the UK. The bank did not say that this would influence its decision on whether to stay in the UK. Its board meets on Sunday to discuss the location of the head office. The HSBC chairman, Douglas Flint, said in April: \u201cIn February, we published a major research study which concluded that working to complete the single market in services and reforming the EU to make it more competitive were far less risky than going it alone, given the importance of EU markets to British trade.\u201d Barclays chairman John McFarlane has said that the clear majority of members of lobby group TheCityUK, which he represents, \u201cfeel that staying in a reformed Europe is the right choice\u201d, while Lloyds chairman Lord Blackwell has said Britain\u2019s membership is not sustainable without \u201csignificant change\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A recovery in US consumer spending revived battered stock markets in Europe and New York on Friday, despite the latest eurozone GDP figures showing a broad slowdown across the currency union and Greece slipping back into recession. The FTSE 100 soared 169 points to register the strongest daily increase since last August, before the Dow Jones index followed suit in New York, wiping out much of the losses from earlier in the week as January figures for US consumer spending beat expectations. The FTSE 100 still ended the week down 2.4%. Nine of the 10 major sectors in Wall Street\u2019s Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s index were higher, led by a 2.4% rise in the financial sector, which fought off concerns that low interest rates and risky lending had undermined the stability of some institutions. Banks were helped by comments from Bill Dudley, deputy chairman of the US Federal Reserve, who said they were well capitalised and able to withstand a global shock. JP Morgan jumped 5.6% to $56.05 a share after chief executive Jamie Dimon bought more than $25m (\u00a317.24m) of the bank\u2019s stock. For much of the week, investors feared that a contraction in US factory output, sluggish employment growth and persistently low inflation were signals that the US economy was heading for a recession. Plunging oil prices, which slumped below $27 a barrel in the US, falling commodity values and a rush by investors to safe haven assets added to the gloomy picture. James Knightley, an economist at ING Financial Markets, said resilient US employment, rising real incomes and a recovering housing market in a period of extreme volatility on global markets, were providing enough offsetting effects for now. \u201cHowever, equity markets don\u2019t seem particularly interested unfortunately and the longer that this goes on the greater the risk that it feeds negatively into the real economy through weaker sentiment and tighter financial conditions,\u201d he said. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said the health of the US economy depended on how well it could weather the global risks in the long term, especially a devaluation of the Chinese currency that would make US exports more expensive. \u201cClearly, the tentacles of the Chinese slowdown are spreading and the lack of a clear enough policy is a red flag to ongoing volatility,\u201d she said. Fed chief Janet Yellen failed to calm markets during an appearance on Capitol Hill this week, when she said that it was possible the central bank would cut rates if the situation deteriorated. Dudley waded into the debate on Friday, downplaying the likelihood of a rate cut: \u201cTo me, that\u2019s not something that should be part of the conversation right now.\u201d The US economy has \u201cquite a bit\u201d of momentum that will help offset weakness from abroad, he said, even as he acknowledged he now expected inflation to take a bit longer to return to the Fed\u2019s 2% target because of the drag from the falling price of oil. The 19-member eurozone economy added another prop to market sentiment after figures showed it grew 0.3% in the final quarter of 2015 after German exports put in a strong performance. But analysts continued to worry that the refugee crisis and the prospect of Greece defaulting on its loans, forcing it to seek further funds from Brussels and the International Monetary Fund, would halt the eurozone recovery. France and Italy, which appeared to be recovering strongly last spring, showed that even the second and third largest economies in the currency zone were ailing. France could only manage 0.2% growth in the final quarter while Italy registered 0.1% growth, despite benefiting from low energy costs, an export-boosting drop in the euro\u2019s value and monetary stimulus from the central bank. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said the downside risks had increased and as a result the European Central Bank will back \u201cfurther decisive policy support\u201d at its March meeting. Greece, which has seen its debt to GDP ratio soar past 190% in recent months, fell into recession after recording its second quarter of negative growth. The Syriza government, led by prime minister Alexis Tsipras, has struggled to maintain a recovery that followed an accord signed last summer for a third bailout. Lenders are demanding that Greece scrap tax breaks for farmers and impose pension reforms that will lead to higher monthly contributions from the self-employed and salaried employees. Farmers carried their protest to Athens on Friday, driving tractors through the centre of the city and rioting when blocked by police from approaching government buildings.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest banks are preparing to hand out an estimated \u00a35bn in bonuses even as they cut thousands of jobs and endure dramatic falls in their stock market value. With investors taking fright at the prospects for the banking industry, major high street lenders are finalising the bonus pools they will pay out in the coming weeks when they report their results for 2015. Bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland is expected to hand out bonuses despite being on course for its eight consecutive year of losses. It has not made a profit since 2007 and in 2008 slumped to a record loss for corporate Britain, receiving a \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout. Rival bailed-out bank Lloyds is also expected to hand out bonuses, as are Barclays and HSBC. According to one estimate by Sky News, the total for bonuses could be in the region of \u00a35bn. While down on the levels paid the previous year, the sums could prove surprising, given investors\u2019 concerns about the banking industry. At one point this week, the leading index of UK bank shares dropped to levels not seen since the depths of the post-Lehman Brothers recession in early 2009, amid the global rout on stock markets. Investors are concerned about the prospects for the banking industry in the low-interest environment, particularly with the prospect of negative interest rates, which make it increasingly difficult for them to make profits on their lending. The Robin Hood Tax campaign, which advocates a tax on the financial sector, said: \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that banks are doling out huge sums to their lucky few while still being knee-deep in scandals. The City seems to operate in a parallel universe to the rest of the economy \u2013 it is time the government helped bring it back to reality.\u201d Lloyds has pledged to cut its bonus pool after being fined \u00a3117m in June for mishandling compensation claims for payment protection insurance, and it could still pay out more than \u00a3300m. The bank is also in the process of cutting jobs. Last week, 1,755 staff were told they would lose their jobs, part of a programme to remove 9,000 roles in three years. The biggest bonuses are expected at Barclays and HSBC, both of which have investment banking arms. For 2014, Barclays cut its bonus pool by 22% to \u00a31.9bn and is expected to reduce it again for 2015 under the guidance of its new chief executive, Jes Staley. HSBC is the first bank to report its results on 22 February, when the bank is also expected to publish its annual report, which will shed light on how much HSBC\u2019s boardroom executives received during 2015. A year ago, the bank\u2019s results were overshadowed by the Guardian\u2019s revelations about the tax evasion practices deployed by its Swiss banking arm. The bonus pool at HSBC is expected to amount to about \u00a32.5bn. Earlier this week, the chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, was forced to make a U-turn on pay freezes after protests from staff. None of the banks would comment.",

      "bodyText": "Aldi\u2019s latest promotional campaign has been called misleading and disingenuous after the supermarket claimed that it was more than 30% cheaper than its nearest rivals and launched ads targeting Morrisons. One of the discount chain\u2019s ads compares a basket of six items bought at Morrisons to a basket from Aldi, highlighting that it is 37% cheaper. But the Morrisons basket includes well-known brands such as Tropicana fruit juice, Finish washing powder and Heinz tomato ketchup, while the Aldi selection is all own label. In a separate statement, the retailer also claimed to be more than a third cheaper than all the major supermarkets, based on the average price per pack in the three months to 3 January. Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said: \u201cUsing a comparison between own-label products and branded to suggest Aldi prices are cheaper is misleading and disingenuous. Every supermarket has private label and branded items as well and they could claim a similar difference in their own store. We all know private label goods are cheaper than branded.\u201d A Morrisons spokesperson said: \u201cNo one will be fooled by the way they have picked a handful of premium branded products such as Tropicana and compared them to their own-label products such as \u2018Del Rivo\u2019.\u201d A spokesperson for Asda said: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t help anyone, least of all customers. Customers know if they are buying a brand or own label and when you do advertising that is clearly disingenuous it does a disservice to everybody. Customers aren\u2019t daft.\u201d Asda said that on comparable own-label products, it was now about 10% more expensive than Aldi, compared with a 20% difference two years ago. The supermarket is aiming to reduce the price difference to 5% in future. Matthew Barnes, Aldi\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe believe the comparison is fair and our products are comparable to brands in terms of quality. Last year, we won over 350 product awards and were second only to Waitrose in terms of the number of Which? best buys we were awarded. \u201cThe fact is that customers wouldn\u2019t be coming to us in their droves if the product quality wasn\u2019t comparable. Our commitment is simple, on brand or own label, we won\u2019t be beaten on price. We will always be the cheapest.\u201d Barnes said Aldi was fighting back against claims by the major chains that they had narrowed the price gap in recent months. He said the average price per pack in Aldi was 33% cheaper than in Asda, 38% less than Morrisons, 39% cheaper than Tesco and 53% less than Sainsbury\u2019s. Rival supermarkets and analysts said the use of \u201cprice per pack\u201d meant that Aldi was not comparing like for like, because traditional chains sell a much broader range of products, including many more branded items and packs in different sizes. Typically, a supermarket sells more than 25,000 products, compared with fewer than 3,000 in Aldi. \u201cWe have listened to a huge amount of noise that has gone on in the last few months about the price gap closing. We feel it\u2019s really time to set the record straight and not let baseless claims go unanswered. We won\u2019t let our competitors close the gap. That\u2019s set in stone for us,\u201d Barnes said. He said Aldi had increased its price lead over rivals in the past year. The average price per item at Aldi was down by nearly 6% in December, compared with a year before, Barnes added. This had been achieved by cutting profit margins and improving efficiency, not putting pressure on suppliers, he said. \u201cWe have got quite a big part to play in deflation as competitors try to get closer to us and we move further.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Finally, more on New York Fed president William Dudley playing down talk of negative interest rates in the US, in the wake of Janet Yellen\u2019s comments this week. Edward Helmore writes: New York Fed president William Dudley has dismissed speculation that the US Federal Reserve could adopt negative interest rates as \u201cextraordinarily premature\u201d. Speaking a day after Fed chair Janet Yellen concluded two days of congressional testimony during which she left open questions on whether the US could follow central banks in Europe and Japan by adopting negative rates, Dudley, a voting member on the Fed\u2019s policymaking committee, struck an optimistic tone. He said US households and banks are better able to absorb shocks than they were when the last recession hit. Against a backdrop of supportive US consumer and household debt data released Friday, Dudley added US monetary policy remains \u201cquite accommodative\u201d after the Fed\u2019s decision to raise interest rates in December. \u201cKey sectors of the US economy, such as the household sector, seem to be in good shape,\u201d he said, repeating Yellen\u2019s assertion that despite market turmoil that\u2019s caused the S&amp;P 500 to lose 10% of its value this year, economic expansions do not simply \u201cdie of old age\u201d. The full story is here. On that note we\u2019ll close up, and say thanks for all your comments. See you again soon. Worries about a global slowdown, falling oil prices and the effect of negative interest rates on banks have combined to produce another traumatic week for stock market investors. But the week ended with sentiment much improved, with European markets showing significant gains. Oil jumped on renewed hopes that producers would agree to meet to cut output (although we have heard this many times before), which helped lift energy companies. Nicholas Hyett, investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: Oil stocks are rallying today on speculation that Opec might be willing to cut production. It will need to be a big cut though; some US storage facilities are at 90% of capacity with new production still to come online this year. Banks also came back from their beaten-down levels, after better than expected figures from Commerzbank, news that JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon was snapping up the bank\u2019s shares and Deutsche Bank\u2019s plan to buy back debt. Wall Street also helped, moving higher after better than expected US retail sales, while there appeared to be no real shocks in the eurozone GDP figures, albeit Greece moved back into recession. Investors are already looking ahead to Monday, when Chinese markets re-open after a week\u2019s holiday for New Year. Will its stock market move higher or play catch up with the falls elsewhere in global markets? With Wall Street closed on Monday, it could be another volatile day. Meanwhile the final scores in Europe ahead of the weekend showed: The FTSE 100 jumped 3.08% or 170.63 points to 5707.60, its biggest one day rise since August Germany\u2019s Dax added 2.45% to 8967.51 France\u2019s Cac climbed 2.52% to 3995.06 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 4.7% up at 16,514.87 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.25% better at 7920.8 In Greece, despite the protests and a slump back into recession, the Athens market added 3.04% to 454.29 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 227 points or 1.4% higher. More pictures from Greece, where farmers are protesting outside parliament. And more proof of the volatile week markets have just suffered: Deutsche of course had been hit by worries about its balance sheet and the effect of negative interest rates, like others in the sector, as well as pressure on its contingent convertible bonds. But along with the recovery in bank shares, Deutsche has also been lifted by news it planned to buy back debt. The FTSE 100 has jumped 3.08%, its biggest one day rise since 27 August. As of Thursday, some \u00a380bn had been wiped off the UK\u2019s leading index. With today\u2019s recovery that has been cut to \u00a336bn. More on oil: Despite the current market rally, leading shares still have some way to go to mount a major recovery. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: The week finishes in much better form than it began, with stock markets in Europe and the US clawing back losses, with even some better US retail sales figures adding to the merry mood. European markets in particular can look forward to more positive momentum on Monday, when the US is out of action for Presidents Day. That of course is the short-term picture, and for the FTSE 100 even a significant recovery in coming weeks, similar to that seen in January, would still leave the market in a firm downward move. Oil prices have been on another tear higher today, which has provided a firm base on which to build the broader stock market rally. However, pessimists (and there are many around at the moment) will be quick to point out that there\u2019s little sign of an actual meeting between major oil producers, and that Saudi intransigence on production cuts remains the chief, and currently insuperable, obstacle to tackling the problem of huge oversupply. At least the banks are doing better today, with both the FTSE banking sector and its European counterparts racing away. After all, even if rates aren\u2019t going higher, there\u2019s always the hope of more ECB largesse to sweeten the outlook somewhat... The return of China to the market fray after their holiday could also be key for further gains, although a couple of days of volatility as they play catch-up cannot be ruled out. US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen floated the idea the bank could look at negative rates in her testimony to Congress this week. But one of her colleagues is not so sure. New York Fed President William Dudley said negative rates elsewhere - ie in Japan and Europe - would have little effect on the US economy, reports Reuters, adding that negative rates \u201cshould not be part of the conversation right now in the US.\u201d He also said US bank were in good shape despite the share price falls in the sector in recent days. Negative interest rates should help lift growth and inflation but if the market turmoil continues, the economic consequences could outweigh the benefits, says Michael Pearce at Capital Economics. He says: In principle, cutting policy rates into negative territory should boost growth and inflation. But central banks have not communicated these benefits clearly, and the hesitant way in which they have been introduced has undermined confidence, raising the risk that negative rates do more harm than good. Although markets are rebounding today, the sharp falls in equity prices and in particular bank shares since the beginning of the year have led many to claim that negative rates are damaging global economic prospects. Markets have focused on three main concerns. First, negative deposit rates impose a direct financial cost on banks, harming their profitability and thus their willingness to make new loans...[But] we estimate that negative policy rates in the four European economies that have applied them are costing the banking sector around \u20ac3bn a year. That is a trivial fraction of their assets and is not a game-changer for their profitability either... The second fear is that the rush to impose negative policy rates is the latest front in a futile currency war. There is some truth to this argument as a weaker exchange rate is a key channel through which negative rates can operate. But there is little evidence that the major central banks are competing to weaken their currencies, and insofar as they are, the result will be looser global monetary policy which should be positive for global growth. Perhaps the biggest worry though is that cuts to policy rates have added to the sense that the world economy is slowing sharply and that policymakers are running out of options. Policy loosening has fuelled, rather than soothed, market fears...Central banks themselves are partly to blame for this response because they have repeatedly claimed that policy rates could not be lowered further, only to surprise the markets by cutting rates weeks later. No central bank has given a clear idea of how low interest rates on excess reserves could go, adding to the perception that they are flying blind. Nonetheless, claims that monetary policy has reached its limits are exaggerated. After all, there is still plenty of scope for further quantitative easing. The University of Michigan survey suggests a falling outlook for inflation: The US consumer confidence figures are not too bad under the circumstances, reckons James Knightley at ING Bank: US consumer confidence as measured by the University of Michigan dipped to 90.7 in February versus 92.0 in January. This is a bit weaker than the 92.3 consensus, but isn\u2019t too bad given the scale of equity market sell-off. Indeed, strong employment gains, rising real incomes and a firm housing market are providing enough offsetting effects for now and with retail sales having come in stronger than expected (when upward revisions are included) it looks a reasonably encouraging consumer spending story for now. However, equity markets don\u2019t seem particularly interested unfortunately and the longer that this goes on the greater the risk that it feeds negatively into the real economy through weaker sentiment and tighter financial conditions. And after the US retail sales, here is some less positive news in terms of consumer confidence. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index has missed expectations with a fall from 92 in December to 90.7. The consensus forecast was for a reading of 92 for January. The index of consumers expectations fell from 82.7 to 81, a four month low. Meanwhile business inventories rose 0.1%, in line with forecasts. Oil continues to rebound, on renewed hope of production cuts to stem the supply glut. Apparently helping the rally were reported comments from United Arab Emirates oil minister Suhail Al Mazrouei that producers were ready to work together. But we have been here many times before, and he was also reported as saying that there would be no cuts unless there was full co-operation among producers. There have been several optimistic reports suggesting Opec might be ready to talk to other producers such as Russia about limiting output, but so far no real progress. Nevertheless, Brent crude is now up 5% at $31.59 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 6% better at $27.79. And that is one of the factors helping to support stock markets as they bounce back from recent lows. Another cut in the European Central Bank\u2019s deposit rate in March has strong support among the central bank\u2019s governing council, Reuters is reporting. Any cut could come as part of a broader package including some changes to the bank\u2019s asset purchase programme, but there is little appetite for more radical action . Reuters says markets are pricing in at least two rate cuts by the end of the year, taking the deposit rate from -0.3% to -0.55%. Banking groups are unlikely to be happy, since their shares have been hammered this week by fears about the effects of the wave of negative rates on their balance sheets and margins. Reuters reports one policymaker as saying: \u201cCutting the deposit rate by more than 10 basis points would hurt bank profitability, not a popular idea right now, especially given what\u2019s happening in the banking sector.\u201d With markets elsewhere moving ahead after the recent turmoil (the Nikkei was the exception), the US has joined in the more optimistic mood. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 140 points or 0.9% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.6% higher and the Nasdaq added 1%. Energy and financial stocks were among the early gainers. It appears there is some disagreement over the earlier comments about Greece from the IMF\u2019s Poul Thomsen: But: The US retail sales show consumer spending remains important to the country\u2019s economy but the key question is how it will cope with the global problems, says Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management: Consumer spending has played a starring role in supporting growth in the US\u2019 service-led economy, and the latest retail figures suggest this is set to continue. Lower oil prices have certainly helped, with the US consumer benefitting from cheaper gas to the tune of $80m per day. The labour market continues to strengthen and consumer confidence hasn\u2019t been shaken, all of which bodes well for the domestic economy. What really matters though, is how well the US weathers the global risks in the long-term: namely, Chinese devaluation and the exacerbating effect of the stronger US dollar. Clearly, the tentacles of the Chinese slowdown are spreading, and the lack of a clear enough policy is a red flag to ongoing volatility. Equally, the dollar has been strengthening due to the robustness \u2013 until recently \u2013 of the US recovery and the Fed\u2019s decision to hike rates in December. However, it does drag down exports and adds to the already widening trade deficit. While it\u2019s not yet a case of stunting US growth, all eyes will remain on Yellen to soothe where she can. For now, as hinted in her testimony to Congress, she\u2019ll continue to put any immediate rates rise on hold. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said the US retail sales showed some positive signs: With US data on the whole far from convincing following the interest rate rise, Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be pleased with the green shoots shown in today\u2019s retail sales figures. Any positive figure is a step in the right direction, and onlookers still await an uptick in consumer activity prompted by continuing low fuel and energy prices. Yellen will still be wary given that the numbers have been given a leg-up from the holiday season, and she should expect there to be further strain on the US economy in the coming months. Overall, US retail sales rose 0.2% in January, while the December figure has been revised upwards from a 0.1% fall to a gain of 0.2%, said the Commerce Department. Cheaper fuel prices as the oil price tumbled seemed to encourage spending, although it also cut back revenues at petrol stations, while spending at bars and restaurants was hit by the severe winter weather. But clothing stores saw sales rise 0.2% and online retailers saw a 1.6% jump (the effect of harsh weather again presumably). Over in the US and signs that consumers may be spending again as retail sales beat expectations. Core retail sales - which exclude cars, fuel, building materials and food services - increased 0.6% in January after a 0.3% fall in the previous month. Analysts had forecast an increase of around 0.3%. Deutsche Bank has confirmed earlier reports it may buy back some of its debt, an idea which has been supporting its share price after its falls earlier this week. Deutsche has said it will offer to buy up to \u20ac3bn of European debt and $2bn of US debt. Ahead of Greece falling into recession and the new protests in Athens, the International Monetary Fund has said that fears of the country leaving the eurozone will increase unless a credible reform plan is put together. And Poul Thomsen, head of the IMF\u2019s European department, said it had not yet seen such a plan. He repeated that debt relief - a bone of contention among some of the country\u2019s creditors - needed to be a key element of the programme. He wrote in a new IMF commentary: The IMF does not want Greece to implement draconian fiscal adjustment in an already severely depressed economy. In fact, we have time and again been the ones arguing for a fiscal adjustment path that is more supportive of recovery in the near term and more realistic in the medium term. We have yet to see a credible plan for how Greece will reach the very ambitious medium-term surplus target that is key to the government\u2019s plans for restoring debt sustainability. This emphasis on credibility is crucial for generating the investor confidence that is critical to Greece\u2019s revival. A plan built on over-optimistic assumptions will soon cause Grexit fears to resurface once again and stifle the investment climate. The overriding objective of the IMF\u2019s engagement with Greece is to help the country put itself back on a path of sustainable growth that benefits the Greek people. The IMF will support the Greek authorities and their European partners in developing a program of reforms and debt relief that adds up. There are difficult choices to be made, but it is important to make them so that Greece\u2019s efforts over the last six years are not wasted. On the need for both reforms and debt relief, he said: It is argued that the IMF has made its participation dependent on socially draconian reforms, especially of the pension system. This is not the case. Ultimately a program must add up: the combination of reforms plus debt relief must give us and the international community reasonable assurances that by the end of Greece\u2019s next program, after almost a decade of dependence on European and IMF assistance, Greece will finally be able to stand on its own. This implies an inverse trade-off between ambition of reforms and strength of debt relief\u2014we can certainly support a program with less ambitious reforms, but this will inevitably involve more debt relief. This said, no amount of pension reforms will make Greece\u2019s debt sustainable without debt relief, and no amount of debt relief will make Greece\u2019s pension system sustainable without pension reforms. Both need to come about. There is no doubt that both Greece and its European partners will face politically difficult decisions in the coming months to arrive at a program that is viable\u2014one that adds up. And on pensions, he said Greece is too poor to afford its present pension system: Despite the pension reforms of 2010 and 2012, Greece\u2019s pension system remains unaffordably generous. For instance, the standard pensions in nominal Euro terms are broadly similar in Greece and Germany, even though Germany\u2014measured by the average wage\u2014is twice as rich as Greece. Add to this that Greeks still retire much earlier than Germans and that Germany is much better at collecting social security contributions. The result is that the Greek budget needs to transfer some 10 percent of GDP to cover the gaping hole in the pension system, compared to a European average of some 2\u00bd percent. Clearly, this is unsustainable. The next phase of the eurozone crisis is about to begin, to judge by the latest GDP figures, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott. He writes: Greece is back in recession. Italy is barely growing. Portugal expanded but only at half the expected rate. The message could hardly be clearer: the next phase of the eurozone crisis is about to begin. On the face of it, the performance of the eurozone economy in the final three months of 2015 looks solid if unspectacular, with growth as measured by GDP up by 0.3%. But scratch beneath the surface and the picture looks far less rosy. The beneficial impacts of the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme have started to wear off, as has the effect of the big drop in oil prices in the second half of 2014. The eurozone peaked in the second quarter of 2015 and the trend was starting to weaken even before the recent turbulence on the financial markets... In the short term, further stimulus from the ECB is a bolt-on certainty next month, either through cuts in interest rates or an expansion of its QE programme, or more likely both. In the longer term, a summer of crisis eurozone summits to discuss the fate of Greece looms. Probably not what David Cameron wants as he contemplates how to win his Brexit referendum. Larry\u2019s full comment is here: Here\u2019s our full report on the eurozone GDP figures: More on the yen: Europe\u2019s stock markets continue to shrug off the sight of protests in recession-hit Greece, and lacklustre growth in the euro area. Bank shares are still rallying, with Deutsche Bank up 9% and Commerzbank 17% higher after it announced its first dividend since 2007 today. Here\u2019s the lunchtime scores: FTSE 100: up 100 points at 5636, + 1.8% German DAX: up 136 points at 8,891, + 1.5% French CAC: up 47 points at 3,944, +1.2% David Lamb, head of dealing at the forex specialists FEXCO, says European investors are pinning their hopes on more stimulus from the European Central Bank: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine how the sense of deja-vu could be any stronger. The confirmation that Greece has slumped back into recession came as rioters stalked the streets of Athens to protest against government austerity. \u201cGrowth in the Eurozone\u2019s biggest economies remains weak too, so at first glance it\u2019s a puzzle that both European stocks and the Euro should rally in response to such a bleak picture. \u201cThe reason is the now racing certainty that the ECB will soon restart the Euro\u2019s printing presses. Mario Draghi has dropped ever heavier hints that more QE is coming - and on this evidence it may come as soon as March. Here\u2019s a round-up of the latest eurozone GDP data, from Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Fourth-quarter Eurozone GDP growth was limited by lacklustre German GDP growth of 0.3% quarter-on-quarter, which matched the third-quarter performance. German growth was reportedly held back by negative net trade in the fourth quarter as exports fell and imports rose. In addition, French GDP growth edged down to 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, as it was held back slightly by a hit to economic activity from the Paris terrorist attacks in November. Particularly disappointingly, Italian barely grew in the fourth quarter as GDP edged up just 0.1% quarter-on-quarter. This continued a disappointing slippage in growth through 2015, as quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion came down from 0.2% in the third quarter, 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.4% in the first. Seemingly, unlike most Eurozone countries, Italian GDP was reliant on net trade in the fourth quarter as domestic demand was reported to have been a drag. On a more positive note, Spanish GDP growth held up well at 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, having edged back to this level in the third quarter from a peak growth rate of 1.0% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter. Among the other Eurozone countries, there were modest pick-ups in quarter-on-quarter GDP growth in the fourth quarter in the Netherlands (to 0.3% from 0.1%), Belgium (to 0.3% from 0.2%) and Portugal (to 0.2% from 0.0%). Cyprus grew by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter, which was down slightly from 0.5% in the third quarter. Additionally, there was robust expansion in Slovakia (up 1.0% quarter-on-quarter, as it had been in the third quarter) and Estonia (up 1.2%). However, Greece moved into recession as GDP contracted by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter after a drop of 1.4% in the third quarter as it continued to be hampered by fiscal austerity and capital controls Finland also moved into recession as GDP fell 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter after a drop of 0.6% in the third quarter. Furthermore, Austrian GDP was only flat quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, as it had been in the third quarter. Greece\u2019s protesting farmers are digging in for the long haul. Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports that there are \u201cextraordinary scenes\u201d in the capital, ahead of a major anti-austerity protest later today. She writes: The area outside the agriculture ministry now resembles a war zone after farmers - mostly from Crete - fought pitched battles with police. Have just spoken to Manolis Gazakis, a farmer from the district of Rethymnon, who told me: \u201cWe said it would be war and we meant it. The government has to understand that it is us or them. We are not going to back down over measures that amount to our survival. Just the taxes they are proposing would kill us.\u201d The protestors are threatening to cut off major arteries in and around the city centre. Dozens of units of riot police have been deployed. Concern is such that road checks are even being conducted on trucks for fear that tractors may be hidden inside! Farmers, now pouring into the capital from other parts of the country, are said to be in negotiation with authorities ahead of a major rally later today. Greece\u2019s fall back into recession came as riot police clashed with farmers in Athens. They are holding a big anti-austerity rally, to urge prime minister Alexis Tsipras to withdraws its proposed social security and pension reform plan. Those reforms, though, are demanded by Greece\u2019s creditors in return for bailout funds - and eventual debt relief. Greece has lurched back into recession following the economic and political crisis last summer which saws its banks shuttered and capital controls imposed. Eurostat reports that Greek GDP fell by 0.6% in the last three months of 2015. That follows a 1.4% slump in output in the third quarter, and wipes out growth of 0.2% in April-June. Fourth-quarter GDP was a whopping 1.9% lower than a year earlier, Eurostat says. That\u2019s a serious slump, showing the damage suffered by Greece during the long standoff between Athens and its creditors last year. Greek companies have been warning for months that capital controls are hurting them badly, and these figures appear to back that up. Growth of 0.3% is quite mediocre, frankly, given the eurozone benefitted from substantial (and long-awaited) monetary stimulus last year. Lower energy bills should also have given consumers a lift. These charts from Eurostat show how eurozone growth remained at 0.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. Growth also slowed on an annual basis, across both the EU and the eurozone. Breaking: The eurozone economy grew by 0.3% in the final three months of 2015. Capital Economics isn\u2019t impressed with Portugal\u2019s growth rate: Breaking: Portugal also struggled in the last quarter of 2015. New growth figures from Lisbon show that Portuguese GDP only increased by 0.2% in the final quarter of 2015. Economists had hoped for growth of +0.4%. On an annual basis, Portugal\u2019s economy only expanded by 1.2% over 2015, below expectations of 1.4% growth. Italy\u2019s slowing economy will fuel concerns that Europe\u2019s recovery is running out of puff. Holger Sandte of Nordea Markets has tweeted this graph, showing how the eurozone lost momentum during 2015: We\u2019re expecting the overall euro area GDP figures to show an increase of 0.3% for the last quarter (they are released in 30 minutes). There\u2019s a clear downward trend in Italy\u2019s quarterly growth over the last year. ABN Amro economist Nick Kounis reminds us that Italy has been struggling for a while: Oh deary, deary me. Italy\u2019s economy only grew by 0.1% in the final three months of 2015, new data show. That\u2019s only half as fast as in July-September, when Italy expanded by 0.2%. It dashes hopes that growth might accelerate to +0.3%, and underlines the weakness of the eurozone economy. It appears that poor domestic demand held Italy back. The FT\u2019s Rome correspondent, James Politi, sounds worried: A flurry of new GDP data is hitting the wires. Poland has posted decent-looking growth, with GDP gaining 3.9% in the last year, or 1.1% quarter-on-quarter. And Bulgaria has grown by 3.1% annually, and 0.8% in the last quarter. Deutsche Bank is scrambling off the mat - shares are up by around 4%, and the cost of insuring its bonds against default has dipped. Greece and Italy share the dubious distinction of the worst-performing stock markets in 2016. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has lost a quarter of its value since January 1, while the Athex Composite has plunged by 30%. Spain, Germany and Austria are also lagging, with losses of around 17% each. Back to eurozone GDP, and Finland remains in recession after contracting by 0.1% in the last three months. That follows a 0.5% contraction in the July-September quarter, and means Finland\u2019s economy is still smaller than in 2008. It has suffered from falling demand for its paper industry, the decline of Nokia, and the impact of sanctions on its neighbour, Russia. And as a member of the eurozone, Finland hasn\u2019t been able to devalue its currency. There are remarkable scenes in Athens right now, as farmers protesting against pension cuts and austerity measures clash with riot police. After weeks of protests, which closed motorways, the farmers have decamped to the Greek capital for a mass rally. More than 300 famers have made the trip from Crete, to urge Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government not to impose reforms to social security system. Here\u2019s a video clip which appears to show farmers chasing the riot police down an Athens street: Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says we should be cautious about today\u2019s rally: London\u2019s FTSE-100 is positively flying as the week\u2019s final session gets underway, with almost 100 points having been tacked on already. A late rally on Wall Street and a relatively measured day\u2019s trade across most of Asia \u2013 aside from Japan \u2013 is helping throw a little confidence into the mix as we run towards the weekend break. Oil is also working its way a little higher off recent lows, which will be helping sentiment for stocks - but critically the fundamentals haven\u2019t changed. As such, this still looks more like bargain hunting than the market turning its back definitively on the run lower. London\u2019s shares are surging higher, pushing the FTSE 100 up by 96 points. The other European indices are also higher, helped by those bank and mining shares. Financial shares are rallying across Europe, pushing the Stoxx 600 bank index up by 2.7%. Commerzbank can take some of the credit. Early today the German lender announced its first dividend since 2007, after posting better-than-expected fourth quarter profits. Hold onto your hats! Shares are rallying at the start of trading in London. In London the FTSE 100 has jumped by 62 points, a gain of 1.1%. Most shares are gaining ground, including mining companies and banks who have been badly hit by this week\u2019s panicky selling. Rolls-Royce is leading the rally, after sparing investors another profits warning this morning (although it did slash its dividend). Remember, the Footsie plunged by over 2% yesterday, so this is only a partial recovery after a pretty rough week. Pedestrians in Toyko stopped to stare as their stock market plunged by 5% today, in its worst weekly rout since 2008 today. VP Bank Group chief economist Thomas Gitzel says the 0.3% rise in German GDP was \u201cnot exhilarating\u201d but also not a reason to worry. He told Reuters that: \u201cSlow but steady was the retrospective motto for 2015\u201d The Financial Times points out that Germans have rarely had it so good: Back in the markets, gold is on track for its best week since October 2011 as investors scurry for safety. Gold bugs will be rubbing their hands, after seeing the spot price of bullion jump 6% since Monday. It hit a one-year high of $1,260 per ounce overnight, before dipping a little. Gold\u2019s failing as investment vehicle is that it doesn\u2019t pay a return. But when capital preservation is the name of the game, people pile in. Is Germany getting a refugee boost? ING economist Carsten Brzeski warns that 2016 could be harder for Germany than many people expect. He writes: On top of the well-known risk factor like slowing China and emerging markets or a still struggling Eurozone, low oil prices and the possible weakness of the US economy could give the German economy a hard time. In particular, any slowdown of the US economy could turn out to be a double whammy for Germany. The direct impact through weaker demand from last year\u2019s most important trading partner and the indirect impact through a stronger euro are in our view currently the biggest risks for the German economy. To some extent, there are similarities between Germany\u2019s showcase soccer team Bayern Munich and the Eurozone\u2019s showcase economy. At first glance, both performances look impressive and flawless. At second glance, however, weaknesses have emerged recently. These weaknesses have clearly increased the risk for both Bayern Munich and the German economy to surprisingly be knocked off their respective pedestals in the coming weeks and months. Here\u2019s Carsten\u2019s full take on this morning\u2019s GDP figures. Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi\u2019s eagle eye has spotted something important in the German data (which is online here) Germany\u2019s trade with the rest of the world weakened in the last quarter. Destatis reports that: The development of foreign trade had a downward effect on growth because the exports of goods were down on the previous quarter. Imports decreased, too, though less strongly. Johannes Gareis, economist at French investment bank Natixis, confirms that this held back growth: The German economy achieved \u201cmoderate growth\u201d in the last quarter, says Destatis. And it appears that Germany relied on domestic demand. Destatis explains: General government final consumption expenditure was markedly up, while household final consumption expenditure rose slightly again. A positive development was also observed for capital formation. And this chart shows German growth since the debt crisis began: Here we go! The German economy grew by just 0.3% in the final three months of the year. That matches economist forecasts - and confirms that Europe\u2019s largest economy is only expanding quite modestly. It\u2019s not the robust growth that politicians would like to see - on the other hand, Germany is also avoiding being pulled into recession by the global downturn. Over in Tokyo, traders are catching their breath after riding out the worst week in over seven years. Today\u2019s 4.8% plunge means that the Nikkei has shed 11.1% this week, the biggest weekly drop since October, 2008. Recession fears stalked the markets. Tsuyoshi Shimizu, chief strategist at Mizuho Asset Management, explains: The markets are clearly starting to price in a sharp slowdown in the world economy and even a recession in the United States. \u201cI do not expect a collapse or major financial crisis like the Lehman crisis but it will take some before market sentiment will improve,\u201d he added. Here\u2019s our story on the latest Asian rout: Eurozone GDP day usually starts with French growth numbers. But not today, because INSEE actually reported two weeks ago that the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy grew by only 0.2% in October-December, down from 0.3% in the summer. That weak performance bolstered fears that the French economy was stuttering. IG are calling the European stock markets slightly this morning: But given the volatility this week, who knows? After a wild week, economists hope that today\u2019s eurozone growth figures could provide some relief to the financial markets. Then again, it could make things worse: Good morning. We\u2019re tracking two important stories today - the ongoing turmoil in the world financial markets, and the release of eurozone growth figures for the last quarter. Last night, global markets sank into \u2018bear territory\u2019, when fresh falls on Wall Street dragged world stocks 20% below their recent high: Global stocks enter bear market after another rout - as it happened And the selling hasn\u2019t stopped. Already today, Japan\u2019s stock market has tumbled by another 4.8%, following Thursday\u2019s big selloff in Europe. The selloff appears to being driven by continued fears of a global downturn, and the health of the banking sector - as analysts warn that negative interest rates could seriously threaten their business model. And we\u2019ll get a good insight into the European economy this morning, with a flurry of new growth figures from most of the major EU countries. Here are the main events to watch out for:: Germany: 7am GMT / 8am CET Italy: 9am GMT / 10am CET Portugal: 9,30am GMT / 10.30am CET Greece: 10am GMT / 11am CET The eurozone: 10am GMT / 11am CET Economists predict that eurozone growth remained sluggish at just 0.3%. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events though the day....",

Nicholas Hyett, investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Oil stocks are rallying today on speculation that Opec might be willing to cut production.

He says:</p> <blockquote> <p>In principle, cutting policy rates into negative territory should boost growth and inflation. But central banks have not communicated these benefits clearly, and the hesitant way in which they have been introduced has undermined confidence, raising the risk that negative rates do more harm than good.</p> <p>Although markets are rebounding today, the sharp falls in equity prices and in particular bank shares since the beginning of the year have led many to claim that negative rates are damaging global economic prospects. Markets have focused on three main concerns.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <ul> <li>First, negative deposit rates impose a direct financial cost on banks, harming their profitability and thus their willingness to make new loans...[But] we estimate that negative policy rates in the four European economies that have applied them are costing the banking sector around \u20ac3bn a year. That is a trivial fraction of their assets and is not a game-changer for their profitability either...</li> <li>The second fear is that the rush to impose negative policy rates is the latest front in a futile currency war. There is some truth to this argument as a weaker exchange rate is a key channel through which negative rates can operate. But there is little evidence that the major central banks are competing to weaken their currencies, and insofar as they are, the result will be looser global monetary policy which should be positive for global growth.</li> <li>Perhaps the biggest worry though is that cuts to policy rates have added to the sense that the world economy is slowing sharply and that policymakers are running out of options. Policy loosening has fuelled, rather than soothed, market fears...Central banks themselves are partly to blame for this response because they have repeatedly claimed that policy rates could not be lowered further, only to surprise the markets by cutting rates weeks later. No central bank has given a clear idea of how low interest rates on excess reserves could go, adding to the perception that they are flying blind. Nonetheless, claims that monetary policy has reached its limits are exaggerated. After all, there is still plenty of scope for further quantitative easing.</li> </ul> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bdfc1be4b0eba06ed5fc41\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-12T15:39:25.406Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The University of Michigan survey suggests a falling outlook for inflation:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lavorgnanomics/status/698167972662288388\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">5-10yr <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/inflation?src=hash\">#inflation</a> expectations in the U. of Mich. survey fell 0.3% to 2.4% - lowest reading in the history of the series</p>&mdash; Joseph A.

Lower oil prices have certainly helped, with the US consumer benefitting from cheaper gas to the tune of $80m per day. The labour market continues to strengthen and consumer confidence hasn\u2019t been shaken, all of which bodes well for the domestic economy.</p> <p>What really matters though, is how well the US weathers the global risks in the long-term: namely, Chinese devaluation and the exacerbating effect of the stronger US dollar. Clearly, the tentacles of the Chinese slowdown are spreading, and the lack of a clear enough policy is a red flag to ongoing volatility. Equally, the dollar has been strengthening due to the robustness \u2013 until recently \u2013 of the US recovery and the Fed\u2019s decision to hike rates in December. However, it does drag down exports and adds to the already widening trade deficit. While it\u2019s not yet a case of stunting US growth, all eyes will remain on Yellen to soothe where she can. For now, as hinted in her testimony to Congress, she\u2019ll continue to put any immediate rates rise on hold.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bde36ce4b03f5fd9ef2ea0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-12T13:53:11.832Z\">1.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said the US retail sales showed some positive signs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With US data on the whole far from convincing following the interest rate rise, Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be pleased with the green shoots shown in today\u2019s retail sales figures.</p> <p>Any positive figure is a step in the right direction, and onlookers still await an uptick in consumer activity prompted by continuing low fuel and energy prices.</p> <p>Yellen will still be wary given that the numbers have been given a leg-up from the holiday season, and she should expect there to be further strain on the US economy in the coming months.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bde2dae4b0ae601610a543\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-12T13:49:18.331Z\">1.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CapEconUS/status/698140363568115712\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Markets may be pricing in a recession, but obviously no-one told US consumers.

He wrote in <strong><a href=\"https://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2016/02/11/greece-toward-a-workable-program/?hootPostID=406cd1348e266ebe45426232bdc79335\">a new IMF commentary</a></strong>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The IMF does not want Greece to implement draconian fiscal adjustment in an already severely depressed economy. In fact, we have time and again been the ones arguing for a fiscal adjustment path that is more supportive of recovery in the near term and more realistic in the medium term.</p> <p>We have yet to see a credible plan for how Greece will reach the very ambitious medium-term surplus target that is key to the government\u2019s plans for restoring debt sustainability. This emphasis on credibility is crucial for generating the investor confidence that is critical to Greece\u2019s revival. A plan built on over-optimistic assumptions will soon cause Grexit fears to resurface once again and stifle the investment climate.</p> <p>The overriding objective of the IMF\u2019s engagement with Greece is to help the country put itself back on a path of sustainable growth that benefits the Greek people. The IMF will support the Greek authorities and their European partners in developing a program of reforms and debt relief that adds up. There are difficult choices to be made, but it is important to make them so that Greece\u2019s efforts over the last six years are not wasted.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the need for both reforms and debt relief, he said:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is argued that the IMF has made its participation dependent on socially draconian reforms, especially of the pension system. This is not the case. Ultimately a program must add up: the combination of reforms plus debt relief must give us and the international community reasonable assurances that by the end of Greece\u2019s next program, after almost a decade of dependence on European and IMF assistance, Greece will finally be able to stand on its own. This implies an inverse trade-off between ambition of reforms and strength of debt relief\u2014we can certainly support a program with less ambitious reforms, but this will inevitably involve more debt relief.</p> <p>This said, no amount of pension reforms will make Greece\u2019s debt sustainable without debt relief, and no amount of debt relief will make Greece\u2019s pension system sustainable without pension reforms. Both need to come about. There is no doubt that both Greece and its European partners will face politically difficult decisions in the coming months to arrive at a program that is viable\u2014one that adds up.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on pensions, he said Greece is too poor to afford its present pension system:</p> <blockquote> <p>Despite the pension reforms of 2010 and 2012, Greece\u2019s pension system remains unaffordably generous. For instance, the standard pensions in nominal Euro terms are broadly similar in Greece and Germany, even though Germany\u2014measured by the average wage\u2014is twice as rich as Greece. Add to this that Greeks still retire much earlier than Germans and that Germany is much better at collecting social security contributions. The result is that the Greek budget needs to transfer some 10 percent of GDP to cover the gaping hole in the pension system, compared to a European average of some 2\u00bd percent. Clearly, this is unsustainable.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-12T14:24:28.771Z\">at 2.24pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56bdd9b1e4b0999485acbd94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/larryelliott\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-12T13:12:21.639Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The next phase of the eurozone crisis is about to begin, to judge by the latest GDP figures, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott.

Seemingly, unlike most Eurozone countries, Italian GDP was reliant on net trade in the fourth quarter as domestic demand was reported to have been a drag. </p> <p>On a more positive note, <strong>Spanish</strong> GDP growth held up well at 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, having edged back to this level in the third quarter from a peak growth rate of 1.0% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter.</p> <p>Among the other Eurozone countries, there were modest pick-ups in quarter-on-quarter GDP growth in the fourth quarter in the <strong>Netherlands </strong>(to 0.3% from 0.1%), <strong>Belgium</strong> (to 0.3% from 0.2%) and <strong>Portugal </strong>(to 0.2% from 0.0%). <strong>Cyprus</strong> grew by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter, which was down slightly from 0.5% in the third quarter.</p> <p>Additionally, there was robust expansion in <strong>Slovakia </strong>(up 1.0% quarter-on-quarter, as it had been in the third quarter) and <strong>Estonia</strong> (up 1.2%).<br></p> <p>However, <strong>Greece</strong> <strong>moved into recession</strong> as GDP contracted by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter after a drop of 1.4% in the third quarter as it continued to be hampered by fiscal austerity and capital controls<br></p> <p><strong>Finland also moved into recession</strong> as GDP fell 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter after a drop of 0.6% in the third quarter. </p> <p>Furthermore, <strong>Austrian </strong>GDP was only flat quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, as it had been in the third quarter.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bdba2de4b00fe68dd2501d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-12T10:55:59.599Z\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Greece\u2019s protesting farmers are digging in for the long haul.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/northaura/status/698097387923968000\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Athens: protesting farmers camp at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/syntagma?src=hash\">#syntagma</a> sq.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "New York Fed president William Dudley has dismissed speculation that the US Federal Reserve could adopt negative interest rates as \u201cextraordinarily premature\u201d. Speaking a day after Fed chair Janet Yellen concluded two days of congressional testimony during which she left open questions on whether the US could follow central banks in Europe and Japan by adopting negative rates, Dudley, a voting member on the Fed\u2019s policymaking committee, struck an optimistic tone. He said US households and banks are better able to absorb shocks than they were when the last recession hit. Against a backdrop of supportive US consumer and household debt data released Friday, Dudley added US monetary policy remains \u201cquite accommodative\u201d after the Fed\u2019s decision to raise interest rates in December. \u201cKey sectors of the US economy, such as the household sector, seem to be in good shape,\u201d he said, repeating Yellen\u2019s assertion that despite market turmoil that\u2019s caused the S&amp;P 500 to lose 10% of its value this year, economic expansions do not simply \u201cdie of old age\u201d. \u201cExpansions end either because a significant inflation risk emerges that requires a sharp tightening of monetary policy, or the economy is adversely impacted by a large shock that cannot be offset by monetary policy in a timely manner,\u201d Dudley said. \u201cSince the possibility is low that a significant inflation risk would emerge over the near term, this means that the main danger facing the current expansion is the risk of large, adverse shocks.\u201d However, Dudley acknowledged inflation lags behind the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Dudley\u2019s remarks may go some way to calm concern that the US banks could enter \u201ca doom loop\u201d in which negative interest rates established at a central bank level encourage investors to \u201cshort\u201d bank stocks, forcing institutions to cut lending which could, in turn, force further liquidity easing by central bankers that serves only to intensify the destructive cycle. Earlier this week, economists at JP Morgan Chase warned that banks might respond to negative rates by cutting lending. Institutional lenders point out negative rates come at a moment when other avenues of business have been restricted by post-2008 market re-regulation while stock, bond and commodity trading is less profitable. Negative rate moves in Europe and Japan have gone hand-in-hand with global market turbulence and driven down the bank stocks on both sides of the Atlantic. On Friday, Deutsche Banke, one of Europe\u2019s worst affected banks with shares down 40% this year, said it would buy back $5.4bn of unsecured debt in a move designed to bolster investor confidence in the German lender\u2019s liquidity and in the value of its securities. But with little room to manouvre, US bankers are keen to describe a clear distinction between their operations and their European banking counterparts. Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn said the European banks had been \u201cslow\u201d to recapitalize after the 2008 financial crisis and get their financial balance sheet in the \u201cbest place it can be\u201d. \u201cWe took our medicine early,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Rolls-Royce has said the power systems engineering group is studying the implications of Britain voting to leave the European Union in a signal that leading businesses are increasingly concerned that Brexit is a real possibility. Rolls employs more than 20,000 people in Britain and invests hundreds of millions of pound into research and development, making it a vital cog in the government\u2019s industrial strategy. Warren East, chief executive, said he \u201cabsolutely believes\u201d it is in the interests of the UK, Rolls, and its suppliers for the company to remain in the EU. However, when asked whether Brexit would lead to Rolls reconsidering its investments in the UK, he said: \u201cWe are looking at the implications should the vote go one way and should we come to Brexit, but we are in favour of staying in the EU.\u201d East was speaking on Friday as Rolls announced its full-year results and cut its dividend for the first time for 24 years. However, shares in the company surged by 14%, closing at 606p, as investors breathed a sigh of relief that Rolls had not issued its sixth profit warning in two years and took heart at comments from East that he is making progress with his turnaround plan. Rolls makes engines for the Airbus A380 superjumbo, the Eurofighter Typhoon jet, and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. It also builds the nuclear-powered propulsion system for Britain\u2019s submarines and parts for ships. However, the company has been hurt by cuts to defence spending by western governments, a fall in demand for corporate jets, and a slump in the oil price, which has meant Rolls\u2019 customers in the energy industry are investing less. In response, East is trying to cut up to \u00a3200m of costs a year and has removed 25% of the company\u2019s 200 senior managers. Rolls was already cutting 3,600 jobs across the business. The Rolls boss said he was \u201cpretty pleased\u201d with the progress at the company since he took charge last summer. \u201cWe have taken out a whole cycle of reviewing the business so if an incident happens then it appears pretty immediately with the leadership team, rather than going into a division and languishing there for a week or a month.\u201d Rolls cut the final dividend payment to investors by 50%, to 7.1p a share. The last time it lowered the payment was 1992. \u201cIt needed to be a meaningful amount to make it worthwhile doing, but it is a sign of the confidence in the business [that a dividend is still being paid],\u201d East said. \u201cWe need to invest in our transformation programmes that we are working on, that is why we need to do it. We are looking to restore it to a healthy level at the appropriate time.\u201d Sandy Morris, analyst at Jefferies, Rolls\u2019 house broker, said the dividend cut was a \u201cpainful step\u201d. However, he added: \u201cWe remain optimistic 2016 will show momentum is building, the hurdles are being overcome and, to be blunt, that Rolls-Royce management has control and is growing in confidence.\u201d Rolls reported a 12% fall in underlying pre-tax profits to \u00a31.43bn in 2015. Profits excluding one-off items were \u00a31.36bn, in line with the bottom end of the company\u2019s forecasts. Analysts are expecting 2016 to be even more difficult for Rolls, with profits forecast to halve. The company is suffering as Airbus and Boeing transition to new aircraft, meaning demand is waning for some of Rolls\u2019 most successful engines, such as the Trent 700. However, Rolls is confident of increasing its share of the civil aerospace market and highlighted growth of 4% in its order book as it rolls out new aircraft engines such as the Trent XWB, 1000 and 7000. Rolls is still mired in a Serious Fraud Office investigation about bribery allegations in China, Indonesia and other parts of the world. The company said in the results that it is \u201ccontinuing to cooperate with the authorities in the UK, US and elsewhere\u201d. Rolls added: \u201cAs the investigations are still ongoing we are unable to give any further details or a timescale for when they will conclude.\u201d The company has also held talks with ValueAct, the Californian activist investor, which has built up a 10% stake and is pushing for a seat on the board. East said the board is yet to make a decision about whether to hand ValueAct a seat. ValueAct declined to comment on Rolls\u2019 results.",

      "bodyText": "He had the tastes of a typical millionaire. He owned a gold and silver Rolex and a fleet of expensive cars. He liked to dabble in modern art. But although this Chinese businessman had several companies and a palatial villa in the Madrid suburbs, he had almost no money in the bank, a detail that piqued the interest of Spanish authorities. Gao Ping, who had lived most of his adult life in Spain, had a monopoly on supplies to 4,000 Chinese bazaars across the Mediterranean country. But authorities suspected he was not paying taxes on the clothes, furniture and other goods he was importing from China. When police swooped on his warehouses in 2012 they found piles of cash: wads of \u20ac100, \u20ac200 and \u20ac500 notes were wrapped in elastic bands. Around \u20ac12m (\u00a39.31m) was wheeled away in trolleys, the largest-ever cash seizure by Spanish police. The gang, with Gao the alleged ringleader, stands accused of laundering up to \u20ac300m a year, as well as selling counterfeit goods and toys with fake safety marks. The government prosecutor said Gao\u2019s illegal business was so big it was damaging the competitiveness of Spain. Gao is on bail; the case has not yet come to trial. Law enforcement officials have long had concerns about \u20ac500 notes. Small and easy to transport relative to their value, they are the payment method of choice for tax dodgers, money launderers and drug barons. The sum of \u20ac1m in \u20ac500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag, where the same amount in \u20ac50 notes would require a small suitcase. Cash mules have been known to fold the notes into plastic pellets and swallow them. A less dangerous method of concealment is to stuff the banknotes into a car chassis. The UK stopped distribution of the \u20ac500 note in 2010 on the grounds that demand for it was \u201calmost entirely for criminal purposes\u201d. In 2009 Italy\u2019s central bank warned that the notes were widely used by mafia money launderers and terrorists. Other countries have limited their own high-denomination notes due to links to organised crime \u2013 Canada scrapped its $1,000 note in 2000 on the advice of law enforcement officers. In an age of electronic payment systems and contactless cards, more are questioning whether printing these notes can be justified. Earlier this week, Peter Sands, the former head of Standard Chartered bank, called for the abolition of high denomination notes, including the \u20ac500, the $100, the 1000 Swiss Franc note and the \u00a350. In a report for the Harvard Kennedy school of government, Sands argued it was time to get rid of high-value notes that make life easier for \u201cbad guys\u201d pursuing tax evasion, financial crime, terrorist finance and corruption. Although criminals would switch to smaller-denomination bills, or gold or diamonds, these substitutes are bulkier and more traceable, making it more likely they will get caught, he said. At a conference on terrorist financing in London, the head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, called on the European Central Bank to look at whether it \u201cshould continue to produce and circulate these notes that make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide their business and to fund illegal activities\u201d. According to Europol, the purple \u20ac500 note accounts for 30% of the value of all the euro notes in circulation, although most people have never seen one. The \u20ac500 note was introduced in 2002 when the euro was born: it replaced the 1,000 Deutschmark, the 10,000 Belgian franc and the 500,000 Italian lira. Several European countries favoured high-value banknotes. \u201cIt is definitely a preference that has been there for a long time,\u201d says Pia H\u00fcttl, an affiliate fellow at the Bruegel thinktank. \u201cThe preference is based on the idea that [cash] has a lower cost and is accepted everywhere.\u201d Cash remains king in Germany and Austria, where more than half of all transactions are made with paper money and coins. The former president of Germany\u2019s constitutional court, Hans-J\u00fcrgen Papier, told Germany\u2019s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that restrictions on cash were at odds with individual freedom, while tabloid newspaper Bild has launched a petition in defence of paper money, including the \u20ac500 note - \u201chands off my cash\u201d. Law enforcement authorities are less convinced, amid a steady stream of reports of suspicious bundles of cash. In one case that caught the attention of police in the last week, two men walked into a bank and tried to deposit \u20ac200,000 of torn and muddy \u20ac500 notes. In the same week, \u20ac1.3m in the notes was found stuffed in the false bottom of suitcase. But a suspicion of criminality is not enough to keep people in custody. \u201cOur frustration from a law enforcement perspective is that ... in many jurisdictions it is impossible to provide sufficient evidence to satisfy judicial authorities of a link between suspicious cash detections and criminality,\u201d says Jennifer MacLeod, a specialist in Europol\u2019s financial intelligence group. \u201cThe search for these links is complicated further through time constraints and fragmented cooperation and information exchange.\u201d The agency would like to see central banks take more responsibility for the \u201cstriking anomalies\u201d in the use of \u20ac500 notes. Luxembourg, for example, issued more than twice its annual GDP in banknotes in 2013 alone, despite being one of the most cash-averse countries in Europe. Europol asked Luxembourg\u2019s central bank to explain. \u201cThe reply we had from Luxembourg is that they simply issue the notes requested and have no explanation for the reasons behind the demand,\u201d MacLeod says. \u201cI find it surprising that a central bank does not consider itself to have a responsibility in this area.\u201d This could be changing. Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB, has said he is determined that the income the bank generates from issuing the notes should not be \u201ca comfort for criminals\u201d. Other members of the ECB\u2019s top team, such as Yves Mersch, contend there is no evidence about the criminal uses of the \u20ac500 note. But amid heightened fears about terrorism, this argument may no longer cut any ice. EU finance ministers have called on policymakers to explore \u201cappropriate restrictions\u201d on high-value notes and report back by 1 May. Any doubt about criminals\u2019 use of cash should have been demolished by a US-led operation against Hezbollah agents in Europe that uncovered a massive money-laundering scheme to fund terrorism. The US Drug Enforcement Administration and authorities in seven European countries announced earlier this month they had uncovered a network of couriers in charge of millions of euros in proceeds from the sale of cocaine in Europe. The money was sent to the Middle East, where some of it was used to buy weapons for gunmen fighting for Bashar al-Assad. And one of the means for turning cocaine into Kalashnikovs - the \u20ac500 note.",

But although this Chinese businessman had several companies and a palatial villa in the Madrid suburbs, he had almost no money in the bank, a detail that piqued the interest of Spanish authorities.<br></p> <p>Gao Ping, who had lived most of his adult life in Spain, had a monopoly on supplies to 4,000 Chinese bazaars across the Mediterranean country. But authorities suspected he was not paying taxes on the clothes, furniture and other goods he was importing from China.<br></p> <p>When police swooped on his warehouses in 2012 they found piles of cash: wads of \u20ac100, \u20ac200 and \u20ac500 notes were wrapped in elastic bands.

Small and easy to transport relative to their value, they are the payment method of choice for tax dodgers, money launderers and drug barons. The sum of \u20ac1m in \u20ac500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag, where the same amount in \u20ac50 notes would require a small suitcase. Cash mules have been known to fold the notes into plastic pellets and swallow them. A less dangerous method of concealment is to stuff the banknotes into a car chassis.</p> <p>The UK stopped distribution of the \u20ac500 note in 2010 on the grounds that demand for it was \u201calmost entirely for criminal purposes\u201d. In 2009 Italy\u2019s central bank warned that the notes were widely used by mafia money launderers and terrorists. Other countries have limited their own high-denomination notes due to links to organised crime \u2013 Canada scrapped its $1,000 note in 2000 on the advice of law enforcement officers. </p> <p>In an age of electronic payment systems and contactless cards, more are questioning whether printing these notes can be justified. Earlier this week, Peter Sands, the former head of Standard Chartered bank,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/08/high-denomination-bank-notes-should-be-scrapped\"> called for the abolition of high denomination notes</a>, including the \u20ac500, the $100, the 1000 Swiss Franc note and the \u00a350. In <a href=\"http://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/publications/awp/awp52\">a report for the Harvard Kennedy school of government</a>, Sands argued it was time to get rid of high-value notes that make life easier for \u201cbad guys\u201d pursuing tax evasion, financial crime, terrorist finance and corruption. Although criminals would switch to smaller-denomination bills, or gold or diamonds, these substitutes are bulkier and more traceable, making it more likely they will get caught, he said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/08/high-denomination-bank-notes-should-be-scrapped\">Scrap high-denomination banknotes, urges ex-bank boss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At a conference on terrorist financing in London, the head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, called on the European Central Bank to look at whether it \u201cshould continue to produce and circulate these notes that make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide their business and to fund illegal activities\u201d. According to Europol, the purple \u20ac500 note accounts for 30% of the value of all the euro notes in circulation, although most people have never seen one. </p> <p>The \u20ac500 note was introduced in 2002 when the euro was born: it replaced the 1,000 Deutschmark, the 10,000 Belgian franc and the 500,000 Italian lira. Several European countries favoured high-value banknotes. \u201cIt is definitely a preference that has been there for a long time,\u201d says Pia H\u00fcttl, an affiliate fellow at the Bruegel thinktank. \u201cThe preference is based on the idea that [cash] has a lower cost and is accepted everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Cash remains king in Germany and Austria, where more than half of all transactions are made with paper money and coins. The former president of Germany\u2019s constitutional court, Hans-J\u00fcrgen Papier, told <a href=\"http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/wirtschaftspolitik/ehemaliger-verfassungsrichter-abschaffung-von-bargeld-ist-verfassungswidrig-14059694.html\">Germany\u2019s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung </a>that restrictions on cash were at odds with individual freedom, while tabloid newspaper Bild has launched a petition in defence of paper money, including the \u20ac500 note - \u201chands off my cash\u201d.<br></p> <p>Law enforcement authorities are less convinced, amid a steady stream of reports of suspicious bundles of cash. In one case that caught the attention of police in the last week, two men walked into a bank and tried to deposit \u20ac200,000 of torn and muddy \u20ac500 notes. In the same week, \u20ac1.3m in the notes was found stuffed in the false bottom of suitcase. But a suspicion of criminality is not enough to keep people in custody. \u201cOur frustration from a law enforcement perspective is that ... in many jurisdictions it is impossible to provide sufficient evidence to satisfy judicial authorities of a link between suspicious cash detections and criminality,\u201d says Jennifer MacLeod, a specialist in Europol\u2019s financial intelligence group. \u201cThe search for these links is complicated further through time constraints and fragmented cooperation and information exchange.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/12/eu-finance-ministers-call-for-restrictions-on-500-euro-note-crime\">EU finance ministers call for restrictions on \u20ac500 note over crime fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The agency would like to see central banks take more responsibility for the \u201cstriking anomalies\u201d in the use of \u20ac500 notes. Luxembourg, for example, issued more than twice its annual GDP in banknotes in 2013 alone, despite being one of the most cash-averse countries in Europe. Europol asked Luxembourg\u2019s central bank to explain. \u201cThe reply we had from Luxembourg is that they simply issue the notes requested and have no explanation for the reasons behind the demand,\u201d MacLeod says. \u201cI find it surprising that a central bank does not consider itself to have a responsibility in this area.\u201d <br></p> <p>This could be changing. Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB, has said he is determined that the income the bank generates from issuing the notes should not be \u201ca comfort for criminals\u201d. Other members of the ECB\u2019s top team, such as Yves Mersch, contend there is no evidence about the criminal uses of the \u20ac500 note. But amid heightened fears about terrorism, this argument may no longer cut any ice. EU finance ministers have called on policymakers to explore \u201cappropriate restrictions\u201d on high-value notes and report back by 1 May.</p> <p> Any doubt about criminals\u2019 use of cash should have been demolished by a US-led operation against Hezbollah agents in Europe that uncovered a massive money-laundering scheme to fund terrorism. The US Drug Enforcement Administration and authorities in seven European countries announced earlier this month they had uncovered a network of couriers in charge of millions of euros in proceeds from the sale of cocaine in Europe. The money was sent to the Middle East, where some of it was used to buy weapons for gunmen fighting for Bashar al-Assad. And one of the means for turning cocaine into Kalashnikovs - the \u20ac500 note.</p>",

The French finance minister, Michel Sapin, said it was right to ask questions about the use of the euro\u2019s largest-denomination note. \u201cThe \u20ac500 note is more used to conceal then to purchase, more used for easing dishonest transactions than to allow you and I to buy something to feed ourselves,\u201d he said. At a meeting in Brussels on Friday, the 28 finance ministers of the EU called on the European commission \u201cto explore the need for appropriate restrictions on cash payments exceeding certain thresholds\u201d. They also asked the EU\u2019s executive arm, to engage with the European Central Bank to \u201cconsider appropriate measures on high denomination notes, in particular the \u20ac500 note\u201d. France has stepped up restrictions on the use of cash, following the \u201clow-cost\u201d terrorist attacks that struck Paris last year. The January 2015 attacks on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket that killed 17 people were funded with cash, earned partly from the sale of counterfeit goods. In response, the French government tightened restrictions on cash payments and stepped up monitoring of high-value withdrawals. Since September, French citizens can only make cash payments of \u20ac1,000, down from \u20ac3,000, while cash withdrawals or deposits exceeding \u20ac10,000 in a month are automatically checked by money-laundering authorities. Since the 13 November attacks in Paris, France has been pushing for a common EU approach against terrorist financing. An EU action plan published earlier this month stated that \u20ac500 notes \u201care in high demand among criminal elements ... due to their high value and low volume\u201d. The \u20ac500 note, worth around \u00a3389 at current rates, is one of the highest-value banknotes in the world, along with the Swiss 1,000 franc note (\u00a3707). But in an age of electronic payments and concern about the anonymity cash provides, many experts would like to see the notes scrapped. This week Peter Sands, the former chief executive of Standard Chartered, called for the abolition of the \u20ac500, $100, SFr1,000 and \u00a350 notes, which \u201cplay little role in the functioning of the legitimate economy [and] a crucial role in the underground economy\u201d. According to Europol, the European police agency, the \u20ac500 note accounts for a third of all the euro notes in circulation, despite their low public profile. About a fifth of all euro banknotes, in denominations from \u20ac50 to \u20ac500, are not held in Europe, raising suspicions that some of the notes are used by foreign criminals. Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner in charge of the euro, who will lead the European commission inquiry following the call by the 28 EU finance ministers, pointed out that the ECB was ultimately in charge of issuing notes and coins. \u201cWe must respect the independence of the ECB,\u201d he added. In the past, law enforcement officials have found the Frankfurt-based bank unwilling to scrap the note, a stance described as \u201cshameless\u201d by former Bank of England policymaker Charles Goodhart. But the ECB president, Mario Draghi, told the European parliament this month that the bank is reviewing its policy on the notes. \u201cWe are determined not to make seigniorage [profits earned from printing the notes] a comfort for criminals,\u201d he said. Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, a French economist who sits on the ECB\u2019s executive board, told Le Parisien on Thursday he found the arguments for retaining the note \u201cless and less convincing\u201d. The EU investigation into cash limits and high-value notes is part of a wider strategy targeted at terrorist financing and money launderers. In June the commission will publish a blacklist of countries that have weak controls on money laundering and terrorist financing. Also on the table are proposals to harmonise the EU\u2019s money-laundering laws. Differences in legal definitions and sentencing \u201ccreate obstacles in cross border and police co-operation to tackle this crime\u201d, said Dombrovskis, who has promised to publish proposals later in 2016.",

      "bodyText": "EasyJet founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou\u2019s budget food store is introducing a 10 of each item limit on purchases from Monday in an attempt to prevent its shelves being cleared by shopkeepers stocking up. The store, which charges 25p each for groceries, was forced to close on Thursday last week, less than two days after it first opened because it had run out of stock, and had to bring in security staff to manage queues. It is also shutting at weekends. A spokesman for easyFoodstore said: \u201cThe idea of this store is to specifically target the most needy, not to help out our competitors in the convenience store market.\u201d He added that shopkeepers had \u201crather stood out in the queue, especially on the way out when they were loaded down with stuff\u201d. On Friday morning, the store, which only sells 70 different products, had sold out of breakfast cereal, coffee, chocolate chip biscuits, frozen pizzas and burgers as it struggled to secure sufficient stock to keep up with demand. In response, the store is limiting customers to 10 of the same product per day \u2013 so it would be possible to buy 10 cans of beans and 10 cans of pasta and 10 bottles of tomato ketchup, but not 30 cans of beans. From 1 March, the store will also reduce its range to about 40 items as it tries to ensure it can keep the shelves filled. Prices will also rise to 29p and stay that way throughout March and April. Last week punters were queuing for more than an hour to get into the store in Park Royal, north-west London, as more than 100 people waited to gain entry. This week, queues continued but were down to only 20 or 30 people. The store has tapped into the booming discount market, in which the German chains Aldi and Lidl have forced the big supermarkets such as Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons to close stores and cut prices. At least one shopper at easyFoodstore travelled from as far as Canterbury to snap up some bargains.",

It is also shutting at weekends.</p> <p>A spokesman for easyFoodstore said: \u201cThe idea of this store is to specifically target the most needy, not to help out our competitors in the convenience store market.\u201d</p> <p>He added that shopkeepers had \u201crather stood out in the queue, especially on the way out when they were loaded down with stuff\u201d.</p> <p>On Friday morning, the store, which only sells 70 different products, had sold out of breakfast cereal, coffee, chocolate chip biscuits, frozen pizzas and burgers as it struggled to secure sufficient stock to keep up with demand. </p> <p>In response, the store is limiting customers to 10 of the same product per day \u2013 so it would be possible to buy 10 cans of beans and 10 cans of pasta and 10 bottles of tomato ketchup, but not 30 cans of beans.</p> <p>From 1 March, the store will also reduce its range to about 40 items as it tries to ensure it can keep the shelves filled. Prices will also rise to 29p and stay that way throughout March and April.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/05/easyfoodstore-shopper-queues-25p-groceries\">Last week punters were queuing for more than an hour to get into the store</a> in Park Royal, north-west London, as more than 100 people waited to gain entry. This week, queues continued but were down to only 20 or 30 people.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/02/will-easyfoodstore-be-the-next-easyjet-or-easycruise\">The store has tapped into the booming discount market</a>, in which the German chains Aldi and Lidl have forced the big supermarkets such as Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons to close stores and cut prices.</p> <p>At least one shopper at easyFoodstore travelled from as far as Canterbury to snap up some bargains.</p>",

The message could hardly be clearer: the next phase of the eurozone crisis is about to begin. On the face of it, the performance of the eurozone economy in the final three months of 2015 looks solid if unspectacular, with growth as measured by GDP up by 0.3%. But scratch beneath the surface and the picture looks far less rosy. The beneficial impacts of the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme have started to wear off, as has the effect of the big drop in oil prices in the second half of 2014. The eurozone peaked in the second quarter of 2015 and the trend was starting to weaken even before the recent turbulence on the financial markets. Three individual countries bear closer examination. The first is Germany, for which growth of 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 1.4% for the year as a whole is as good as it gets. Exports \u2013 the mainstay of the German economy \u2013 are going to face a much more challenging international climate in 2016, particularly with the euro strengthening on the foreign exchanges. Finland is noteworthy, not just because it is officially back in recession after two successive quarters of negative growth and still has a smaller economy than it did when the financial crisis erupted in 2008, but because its performance is worse than that of Denmark and Sweden, two Scandinavian EU members not in the single currency. But by far the most worrying country is Greece, where a crumbling economy and the attempts to impose even more draconian austerity is leading, unsurprisingly, to violent protests on the streets. A contraction in growth makes it even harder for Greece to achieve the already ridiculously ambitious deficit and debt reduction targets set for it by its creditors, and on past form that will lead sooner or later (sooner in this case) to a fresh financial crisis and the imposition of further austerity measures. After six months out of the headlines, Greece is coming back to the boil. The danger is that other weak countries on the eurozone\u2019s periphery \u2013 most notably Italy and Portugal \u2013 suffer from contagion effects. In the short term, further stimulus from the ECB is a bolt-on certainty next month, either through cuts in interest rates or an expansion of its QE programme, or more likely both. In the longer term, a summer of crisis eurozone summits to discuss the fate of Greece looms. Probably not what David Cameron wants as he contemplates how to win his Brexit referendum.",

      "bodyText": "The eurozone recovery remains disappointingly weak after Greece fell back into recession and Italy slowed to near stagnation. The single currency area grew by just 0.3% in the final quarter of 2015, statistics body Eurostat reported on Friday. On an annual basis, the eurozone expanded by 1.5%, down from 1.6% three months earlier, suggesting growth remains weak despite the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus measures and the positive impact of cheap oil. Greece was the worst performing member of the eurozone, with GDP falling by 0.6% in the last three months of last year. That followed a steep contraction of 1.4% between July and September, when capital controls were imposed and its banks were shut. \u201cGreece continued to be hampered by fiscal austerity and capital controls,\u201d said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. The news came as protesting farmers clashed with riot police in Athens, as part of a major demonstration against austerity measures. Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, grew by 0.3% in the last quarter. Domestic demand was solid, but foreign trade had a negative impact on growth with exports falling faster than imports. The country was affected by the slowdown in the global economy, according to Anna Zabrodzka, economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. Zabrodzka said: The slowdown in emerging markets, particularly China, has dampened external demand for German products. The upside should come from the weaker euro, which should partially mitigate soft external demand Carsten Brzeski of ING fears that Germany could struggle in 2016. \u201cOn top of the well-known risk factors like slowing China and emerging markets or a still struggling eurozone, low oil prices and the possible weakness of the US economy could give the German economy a hard time,\u201d he said. \u201cIn particular, any slowdown of the US economy could turn out to be a double whammy for Germany.\u201d Portugal only grew by 0.2% in the last quarter, down from 0.4% in the third quarter. That\u2019s a blow to Lisbon\u2019s new leftwing government, as it tried to unwind some of the austerity measures implemented by its predecessors. Italy was the big disappointment, with expansion slowing to just 0.1% against predictions of 0.3% growth. Italian growth has slowed steadily through 2015, since managing growth of 0.4% in the first three months. And Finland, one of the most fervent supporters of austerity during the debt crisis, is also still shrinking. GDP fell by 0.1% in the last quarter. The Netherlands expanded by 0.3%, while the Spanish economic recovery continued with growth of 0.8%. That made Spain the only large EU member to grow faster than Britain, which posted growth of 0.5%. Holger Sandte of Nordea Markets warned that the eurozone faced \u201cbig risks\u201d this year, if the recent stock market turmoil fed through to the real economy. He said: We currently pencil in GDP growth of 0.3% q/q for Q1. The big question is how much the turmoil on financial markets will weigh on growth. The wealth effect may not be very strong in the euro area, but it is still negative. \u201cMoreover, the euro is about to strengthen which dampens both exports and inflation. On top of that, problems in the banking sectors might mean that bank lending soon will decline before long.\u201d IHS\u2019s Howard Archer also warned that the eurozone figures could be disappointing this year. We have been expecting eurozone GDP growth to improve modestly to 1.7% in 2016, but this is currently looking ever more questionable and may well need to be revised down. \u201cThere are clearly mounting downside risks to the eurozone growth outlook coming from global growth problems and financial market weakness and volatility.\u201d European stock markets rallied on Friday morning, after days of heavy losses. The Stoxx 600 index has shed 15% of its value this year, with bank shares hitting their lowest levels since the 2008 financial crisis.",

      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline has been fined \u00a337.6m by Britain\u2019s competition authority for \u201cillegal behaviour\u201d in relation to its antidepressant Seroxat that resulted in higher costs for the NHS. The Competition &amp; Markets Authority said the pharmaceutical firm had paid generic drugmakers more than \u00a350m between 2001 and 2004 in return for them delaying the launch of cheaper versions of the blockbuster paroxetine drug, branded Seroxat, which sold more than \u00a390m in 2001. Michael Grenfell, the CMA\u2019s executive director for enforcement, said: \u201c[Friday\u2019s] decision sends out a strong message that we will tackle illegal behaviour that is designed to stifle competition at the expense of customers \u2013 in this case, the NHS and, ultimately, taxpayers.\u201d GSK said it did not accept the CMA\u2019s ruling and argued that its actions had saved the NHS money. The group is considering an appeal. The generic drugmakers involved, Generics UK Limited (GUK) and Alpharma, were also fined, bringing the total penalties imposed to \u00a345m. GUK\u2019s former parent Merck was fined \u00a35.8m and further penalties of \u00a31.5m were imposed on Alpharma and its parent Actavis. The CMA said that the \u201cpay-for-delay\u201d agreements \u201cpotentially deprived the NHS of the significant price falls that generally result from generic competition\u201d. In this case, when generic copies came on to the market at the end of 2003, average paroxetineprices dropped by more than 70% in two years. The competition body found that GSK\u2019s agreements with GUK and Alpharma broke the law on anti-competitive deals. However, GSK said: \u201cGSK and the generics companies entered into these agreements at the time in order to settle costly, complex and uncertain patent disputes. The agreements allowed the generics companies to enter the market early with a paroxetine product and ultimately enabled a saving of over \u00a315m to the NHS.\u201d GSK initially challenged the generic firms, claiming that their products would infringe its patents on Seroxat, which expired in 2003, and brought litigation proceedings against GUK and Alpharma. But before litigation went to trial GSK struck deals with the firms, thereby avoiding a lengthy court battle. Grenfell said: \u201cThis investigation shows our determination to take enforcement action against illegal anti-competitive practices in sectors big and small. Cracking down on these practices is essential to protect consumers, to encourage legitimate business activity that such practices stifle, and to stimulate innovation and growth.\u201d Dr Farasat Bokhari, a senior lecturer in the School of Economics at the University of East Anglia, said: \u201cWhile pay-to-delay deals have been investigated in the US for some time now, the CMA\u2019s decision is the first of its kind in the UK, and is likely to have a sobering effect on pharmaceutical companies that try to extend their monopoly in the UK via such deals. It sends a clear message that these business practices will not go unchecked by the competition authorities.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A turbulent week in global stock markets is ending with Europe attempting to stage a recovery. Fears about a severe slowdown in the world economy have sent investors scurrying for safe havens such as gold and the Japanese yen, despite Tokyo trying to weaken the currency, and sent stock markets tumbling. Even with the FTSE 100 adding 1.6%, or 89.02 points, to 5625.99 on Friday, the UK\u2019s leading index is on course for a 3.8% fall on the week and is hovering around its lowest level for three and a half years. Almost \u00a360bn has been wiped off the value of the index this week. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.4% but over the week is down 4.3%, while France\u2019s Cac has lost 5.6% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is 6% lower since Monday. In Japan, the Nikkei reopened after a day\u2019s holiday and immediately caught up with the market slump elsewhere on Thursday. The index dropped 4.8%, meaning it has plunged 11.1% this week, which marks its biggest weekly drop since October 2008. Global stock markets, as measured by MSCI\u2019s all-country world equity index, entered a bear market on Thursday, down 20.18% from its all-time high in May 2015. Analysts said about $1.2tn had been wiped off world equity markets over the week. Apart from worries about a Chinese-led downturn, the introduction of negative interest rates by central banks, including Japan, Sweden and the European Central Bank, has sent shivers through the banking sector. With banks already under pressure to bolster their balance sheets to protect themselves from another financial crisis, the new negative interest rates will further squeeze their margins. Just weeks after the Federal Reserve raised US interest rates, its chair, Janet Yellen, said on Thursday it was also examining the possibility of negative rates. The continuing pressure on oil prices as demand falls amid a supply glut, with no sign of Opec and other producers intending to cut output, has also hit sentiment. But gold has added more than 5% as money floods into what are perceived to be safer assets. But after the week\u2019s sell-off, mining and banking shares are attempting a recovery. Banks were helped by Commerzbank\u2019s results beating expectations, as well as news that JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, was buying $26m worth of the bank\u2019s shares. Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said: As another nerve shredding week draws to a close there appears to be some mild relief for investors as equities try to drive higher. However, it may take some time before investors are truly convinced that a move back in to riskier assets is worthwhile, as the market turmoil emanating from Asia and the eurozone shows no sign of going away any time soon. China\u2019s stock market reopens on Monday after a week\u2019s New Year holiday with Wall Street closed for President\u2019s Day, so further volatility next week cannot be ruled out.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce has cut its dividend payment to shareholders for the first time in almost 25 years and warned of further job cuts to come. The final dividend payment to investors has been slashed by 50%, to 7.1p a share. Analysts had expected a 30% reduction. But relief that the engineering group had not issued another profits warning saw its shares jump 13%, to 602p, although the share price has still halved in value over the past two years. Sandy Morris, analyst at the company\u2019s house broker Jefferies, said: \u201cThe unchanged 2016 guidance should help stop the rot in sentiment. The 50% cut in the final dividend is a painful step, but Rolls makes a fairly clear commitment to a progressive dividend policy.\u201d The dividend cut will hit pension funds, which are among the biggest shareholders in the FTSE 100 company. It is the first dividend reduction since 1992, when the UK was mired in a long-running recession. The engineering group, which makes engines for Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliners and Airbus\u2019s A380 superjumbos, has issued five profit warnings in less than two years. There were fears that the chief executive, Warren East, might be forced to issue a sixth warning on Friday. He said the outlook for the group this year remained unchanged, although he flagged up another \u201cchallenging year\u201d. East added that the company recognised the importance of paying a \u201chealthy\u201d dividend to shareholders. \u201cSubject to short-term cash needs, we intend to review the payment so that it will be rebuilt over time to an appropriate level,\u201d he said. Its finance director, David Smith, said there was no need for a rights issue to shore up the firm\u2019s finances. Underlying profits for 2015 fell 12%, to \u00a31.4bn from \u00a31.6bn. Rolls expects to post an underlying pretax profit of \u00a3664m in 2016. Restructuring charges will be \u00a375m-\u00a3100m this year. The troubled engineering group has been revamping its operations and slashing costs by \u00a3150m-\u00a3200m a year, including cutting 50 of its top 200 senior managers, with further cuts planned. It announced 3,600 redundancies last year. Rolls employs more than 21,000 people in the UK and has major bases in Derby and Bristol. The company said it was confident of increasing its share of the civil aerospace market and highlighted 4% growth in its order book, after it rolled out new aircraft engines, such as the Trent XWB, 1000 and 7000. Rolls also makes engines for Britain\u2019s nuclear submarine fleet as well as parts for ships. It has been hit by cuts to defence spending, falling demand for corporate jets in emerging markets and plunging oil prices, which have led its energy customers cutting back. East said: \u201cIn the context of challenging trading conditions our overall performance for the year was in line with the expectations we set out in July 2015. It was a year of considerable change for Rolls-Royce: in our management, in some market conditions and in our near-term outlook. \u201cOur outlook for 2016 is unchanged; despite steady market conditions for most of our businesses it will be a challenging year as we start to transition products and sustain investment in civil aerospace and tackle weak offshore markets in marine.\u201d The business minister, Anna Soubry, told the House of Commons in December that the government was \u201cmonitoring the situation carefully\u201d. Compounding its difficulties, the company is also being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office about bribery allegations in China, Indonesia and other parts of the world. Further pressure comes from a Californian activist investor, ValueAct, which has built up a 10% stake and is pushing for a seat on the board. Andy Chambers, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said the results \u201cshould start to soothe the nerves of investors\u201d. He added: \u201cAll in all it suggests the civil engine model is not broken, offshore marine is weak due to market conditions \u2026 power systems is more resilient than most expected and defence and nuclear remain robust.\u201d",

The 50% cut in the final dividend is a painful step, but Rolls makes a fairly clear commitment to a progressive dividend policy.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/12/market-turmoil-eurozone-gdp-growth-figures-france-germany-live-updates\">Market turmoil: Germany grows by just 0.3% as exports fall - live updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The dividend cut will hit pension funds, which are among the biggest shareholders in the FTSE 100 company. It is the first dividend reduction since 1992, when the UK was mired in a long-running recession.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The engineering group, which makes engines for Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliners and Airbus\u2019s A380 superjumbos, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/neil-woodford-dumps-rolls-royce-stake-profit-warning\">issued five profit warnings in less than two years</a>. There were fears that the chief executive, Warren East, might be forced to issue a sixth warning on Friday. He said the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/12/rolls-royce-share-price-plunges-after-latest-profit-warning\">outlook for the group this year remained unchanged</a>, although he flagged up another \u201cchallenging year\u201d.</p> <p>East added that the company recognised the importance of paying a \u201chealthy\u201d dividend to shareholders. \u201cSubject to short-term cash needs, we intend to review the payment so that it will be rebuilt over time to an appropriate level,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Its finance director, David Smith, said there was no need for a rights issue to shore up the firm\u2019s finances.</p> <p>Underlying profits for 2015 fell 12%, to \u00a31.4bn from \u00a31.6bn. Rolls expects to post an underlying pretax profit of \u00a3664m in 2016. Restructuring charges will be \u00a375m-\u00a3100m this year.</p> <p>The troubled engineering group has been revamping its operations and slashing costs by \u00a3150m-\u00a3200m a year, including cutting 50 of its top 200 senior managers, with further cuts planned. It announced 3,600 redundancies last year. Rolls employs more than 21,000 people in the UK and has major bases in Derby and Bristol. </p> <p>The company said it was confident of increasing its share of the civil aerospace market and highlighted 4% growth in its order book, after it rolled out new aircraft engines, such as the Trent XWB, 1000 and 7000. </p> <p>Rolls also makes engines for Britain\u2019s nuclear submarine fleet as well as parts for ships. It has been hit by cuts to defence spending, falling demand for corporate jets in emerging markets and plunging oil prices, which have led its energy customers cutting back.</p> <p>East said: \u201cIn the context of challenging trading conditions our overall performance for the year was in line with the expectations we set out in July 2015. It was a year of considerable change for Rolls-Royce: in our management, in some market conditions and in our near-term outlook.</p> <p>\u201cOur outlook for 2016 is unchanged; despite steady market conditions for most of our businesses it will be a challenging year as we start to transition products and sustain investment in civil aerospace and tackle weak offshore markets in marine.\u201d</p> <p>The business minister, Anna Soubry, told the House of Commons in December that the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35108958\">government was \u201cmonitoring the situation carefully\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Compounding its difficulties, the company is also being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office about bribery allegations in China, Indonesia and other parts of the world.</p> <p>Further pressure comes from a Californian activist investor, ValueAct, which has built up a 10% stake and is pushing for a seat on the board. </p> <p>Andy Chambers, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said the results \u201cshould start to soothe the nerves of investors\u201d. He added: \u201cAll in all it suggests the civil engine model is not broken, offshore marine is weak due to market conditions \u2026 power systems is more resilient than most expected and defence and nuclear remain robust.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The global stock market rout has continued in Asia Pacific with Japanese stocks plunging nearly 5% as investors continued to dump risky assets amid uncertainty about the stability of the financial system. Tokyo recorded its biggest weekly fall for more than seven years after fears over a slowdown in the global economy and an overnight selloff in banking shares sent the Nikkei share average down by 4.84%. After 24 hours\u2019 respite offered by a public holiday on Thursday, the Nikkei share index sank below 15,000 points for the first time in 16 months. The Nikkei has fallen 11.1% over the week, the biggest weekly slump since the height of the global financial crisis in 2008. Markets across the region were caught up in the selling despite the promise of a better day when oil prices jumped 5% on comments by an Opec energy minister sparked hopes of a coordinated production cut. South Korea\u2019s main Kospi index ended the day 1.4% while the Kosdaq index of smaller stocks was suspended after plummeting more than 8%. The Hang Seng index was off 1% in Hong Kong. In Australia, where shares entered bear territory earlier in the week, stocks closed down more than 1% led lower by the country\u2019s huge banking sector. The sell-off came despite comments from the Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens that fears of global slump were \u201coverdone\u201d and that investors were panicking. The sell-off on Friday prompted the value of the yen, gold and government bonds to soar as investors rushed to traditional safe-haven assets. The yen was 110.985 to the US dollar on Thursday \u2013 its lowest level since October 2014 \u2013 punishing Japanese exporters, whose overseas earnings will suffer further if the yen continues on its current trajectory. \u201cThe markets are clearly starting to price in a sharp slowdown in the world economy and even a recession in the United States,\u201d said Tsuyoshi Shimizu, chief strategist at Mizuho Asset Management. \u201cI do not expect a collapse or major financial crisis like the Lehman crisis but it will take some before market sentiment will improve,\u201d he added. Japan has seen the worst of the selling this week. Investors are concerned that the yen has appreciated too much against the US dollar despite the Bank of Japan moving to negative interest rates. Upward pressure on the yen has been building thanks to an increasing perception that the next move in US rates might be down after Fed chair Janet Yellen hinted that plans for another rise to add to the one in December were on hold. The country\u2019s automakers were among the hardest hit by the Nikkei\u2019s fall on Friday: Toyota shares fell 6.5% and Honda\u2019s 4.8%. The Nikkei\u2019s woes, coupled with the yen\u2019s surge against the US dollar, has raised speculation that Japan is preparing to intervene to arrest the yen\u2019s rise. The finance minister, Taro Aso, said G20 would consider cooperating to address currency fluctuations when they meet in Shanghai later this month, but he declined to comment on possible intervention. \u201cWe will monitor the developments in the currency market carefully and will respond appropriately when necessary,\u201d he said, according to Kyodo News. Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities questioned the effectiveness of Japanese intervention in currency markets. \u201cAs long as there is speculation about intervention, speculators may test whether the (Bank of Japan) may actually act, so we are bracing for another sell-off in stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the BoJ acts, it may serve as a short-term \u2018painkiller\u2019 but the effect will likely be short-lived.\u201d Analysts had predicted another difficult day for Asian markets amid deepening concern that slow growth and falling oil prices could hit banks\u2019 profits. \u201cThe sell down of global banking stocks continued overnight, slashing share prices in Europe and trampling US indices before a late session comeback,\u201d said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney. \u201cWhile none of the fears that have rattled markets are yet realised, the relentless focus on possible risks will likely see another soggy Asia-Pacific trading session.\u201d",
