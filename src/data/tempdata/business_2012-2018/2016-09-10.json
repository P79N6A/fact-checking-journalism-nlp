      "bodyText": "The eurozone crisis has revealed economic faultlines across the bloc, as it has become clear that some countries have fared better than others in the straitjacket of euro membership. Those differences are laid bare in unemployment figures that show the wildly differing prospects for 15- to 24-year-olds at the heart of the single currency union. Across the eurozone, youth unemployment is running at just over 21%. However, Italy\u2019s Calabria region has a rate of 65%, while Upper Bavaria in Germany is just 3.4%. One union, two different regions \u2013 and a chasm laid bare. Calabria The construction of the port of Gioia Tauro was supposed to mark a new beginning for Calabria. If things had gone as builders envisioned 20 years ago, when the port came to life following private and public investment of hundreds of millions of euros, this impoverished region in southern Italy would have flourished under a new era of industrialisation, thanks to the massive new infrastructure project. But things did not work out as planned. Today, dozens of enormous abandoned warehouses line the shores of Gioia Tauro, a port that is barely operating at sustainable levels and that is known as the playground of the \u2019Ndrangheta, the Calabrian mafia that has transformed the town into the major entry point for cocaine into Europe from South America. Far from being the home to booming new companies, the neighbouring countryside is littered with half-built cement houses among the olive trees and orange groves, a constant reminder of the region\u2019s essential lawlessness. In nearby Polistena, a parish priest known as a fierce critic of organised crime, Don Pino Demasi, bemoans the statistic that makes Calabria the unenviable standout of all of Europe: it has the highest rate of youth unemployment (65%) on the entire continent, with nearly seven in 10 young people here out of work. He puts most of the blame on the state, which he says has abandoned the south to die. The \u2019Ndrangheta, Demasi says, \u201chas become almost an employment agency, where the right to work is conceded as a favour. \u201cThe young person in the south has three possibilities faced with this widespread illegality: one is to adapt to the system, the second is to run away, the third is to stay and to be a protagonist of change,\u201d he says. Antonio Nicaso, an expert on the \u2019Ndrangheta, says young people are not necessarily drawn to the criminal underworld to get rich, but they want a salary, and can make an income by serving as a \u201csoldier\u201d for the organisation. This involves collecting protection money from small businesses \u2013 known in italian as il pizzo \u2013 to running fake companies that launder the \u2019Ndrangheta\u2019s ill-gotten funds. Other options could include working in a family business or relying on political favours for opportunities. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to join the \u2019Ndrangheta, you have to rely on political patronage for other work,\u201d says Nicaso. The overall employment rate for all adults in Calabria is just 39%, according to official figures, far lower than the national average of 56%. During the financial crisis, from 2008 to 2014, real GDP in Calabria declined by 13% and the GDP per capita in the region is much lower than the average in Italy (\u20ac16,177 vs \u20ac 26,548). It is no wonder, then, that Calabria has lost about 3.7%of its population as a result of mass migration out of the region. Typically, Calabrians who leave the region are young people who resettle in northern and central Italy. \u201cThis means that Calabria tends to lose qualified youth who could contribute to the development of the region and instead decide to leave because they are not able to find suitable jobs,\u201d says Maria De Paola, a professor at the University of Calabria. The causes of high unemployment are plentiful: terrible infrastructure \u2013 it takes about six hours to get from Gioia Tauro to Rome by train, because there are no high-speed trains south of Salerno \u2013 low rates of innovation and entrepreneurship, political corruption and criminality. John Dickie, an author and historian, says the once promising port now looks like a \u201ccathedral in the desert. It hasn\u2019t created the kinds of jobs that the state envisioned and so state expenditures were instead scattered very thinly in the form of welfare and other payments that are frequently diverted by patronage politics and sometimes organised crime.\u201d This week, a former local politician and union leaders said a \u201cmockery\u201d was being made of Gioia Tauro after it emerged that Salerno, a competing port city in neighbouring Campania, would be used as the point of departure for new trains made in Calabria and bound for Peru. Anti-mafia advocates, like Demasi, and an organisation called Libera have sought to create opportunities amid the chaos and foster the creation of co-operative businesses using assets that have been seized by the mafia, sometimes controversially. The co-ops exist to take a stand against organised crime and encourage the development of socially conscious and environmentally friendly non-profit businesses. In Palistena, a company called Valle del Marro Libera Terra manages 130 hectares of land, producing organic olive oil, hot pepper pesto, olive paste, aubergines and citrus fruits, employs 12 people year-round and provides up to 30 seasonal and temporary contracts. \u201cThese kids are changing the culture in the territory because when people see that they work seriously and produce, they regain the desire to stay here and not flee,\u201d Demasi says. For the youth of Calabria who stay, and get a job, the challenge is huge. Bavaria Stefan Wimmer and Ralf Guttermeyer have wanted to be firemen ever since they can remember. Both aged 17, they are now in the rare position of making their childhood dream a career: seven weeks ago, they became two of four apprentices at Munich airport\u2019s firefighting services. In Upper Bavaria, where the two teenagers live, their chances were always stacked in their favour. At 3.4%, the administrative district in Germany\u2019s south has the lowest unemployment rate for people aged 15-24 in the entire European Union. The number of people on Germany\u2019s workfare scheme, Hartz IV, is also lower here than anywhere in the rest of the country. Freising, the district of Upper Bavaria which is now home to Munich\u2019s airport, even trumps that: its adult and youth unemployment rates of 2.1% and 1.9% fall way below the 3% which British economist William Beveridge once defined as amounting to full employment. It is also, incidentally, the administrative district with the lowest average age, 39.7, in an otherwise ageing country. Yet among a population of 590,733, there were last year only 751 young people who were registered as out of work. Asked if they know any peers who couldn\u2019t find a job, the two teenagers have to pause to think. Wimmer has a friend who took a long time to find his first job, \u201cbut, to be honest, that was his own fault\u201d. \u201cIn our region, if you apply yourself, then you\u2019ll get a job appropriate to your skills,\u201d said Guttermeyer. Historically, unemployment in the upper half of Bavaria has fallen and risen in accordance with that in the rest of Germany \u2013 just at a higher level. Even before the city of Munich decided to move its new airport to Freising, the region used to enjoy relatively low levels of people looking for work. Thanks to an unusually broad mix of trades, ranging from car manufacturing to high-end, service-sector jobs, the local job market has, in the past, been able to compensate when certain industries were temporarily in crisis. Many of the companies in the area are medium-sized, Mittelstand businesses: out of about 15,000 businesses in Freising, only 240 have more than 100 employees. A large number are family-run, and therefore less mobile. \u201cThis is a conservative area,\u201d said Harald Brandmaier, a career advisor at Freising job centre. \u201cThey care whether you turn up to work on time, but they also stand their ground and stick with their workforce when the economy hits the buffers for a while.\u201d When Munich airport opened its gates in 1992, it therefore found itself faced with the peculiar logic of a local economy in which employers could not choose from an army of unemployed applicants, but had to actively compete with other businesses to court the best talent in the area. Apprentice fireman Guttermeyer, for example, also got a job offer from BMW, who would have paid him a higher starting salary and picked him up from his doorstep in a shuttle bus every morning. In the end, he opted for the airport because it felt more appealing. He now earns \u20ac860 per month, rising to \u20ac1,000 over the next three years, and rides to work from his parents\u2019 house by motorbike. At Munich airport HQ, the pressure to sell itself to potential new recruits is palpable. Reception areas are plastered with posters advertising the airport as \u201cGermany\u2019s best employer\u201d and Theresa Fleidl, the head of human resources, emphasises that Munich\u2019s is the only airport in the world with its own brewery and indoor wave-riding pool, located between terminals one and two. \u201cWe want to offer our employees a world full of experiences,\u201d she said. The airport is now the region\u2019s largest employer, housing 550 companies with a total of about 35,000 workers. A job market with a chronic undersupply of skilled workforce has also forced newcomers to adopt the area\u2019s traditional labour structures. Germany\u2019s much-admired dual education system (in which apprentices are trained jointly by employers and at specialist vocational schools) has grown in Upper Bavaria, not because it was seen as the more responsible thing to do, but because companies, unable to \u201cbuy in\u201d a fully trained-up workforce, often had to mould the workers they needed themselves. Munich airport, for example, offers young people apprenticeship opportunities in real estate management, even though it could conceivably recruit qualified real estate managers from outside the region. \u201cIn other parts of Europe, the state tries to push everyone into university, and you end up with doctors driving trucks,\u201d said Fleidl. \u201cHere, we get the companies to educate their employees, and they can get exactly the workers they want.\u201d",

The co-ops exist to take a stand against organised crime and encourage the development of socially conscious and environmentally friendly non-profit businesses.</p> <p>In Palistena, a company called <a href=\"http://valle%20del%20marro%20libera%20terra/\" title=\"\">Valle del Marro Libera Terra</a> manages 130 hectares of land, producing organic olive oil, hot pepper pesto, olive paste, aubergines and citrus fruits, employs 12 people year-round and provides up to 30 seasonal and temporary contracts.</p> <p>\u201cThese kids are changing the culture in the territory because when people see that they work seriously and produce, they regain the desire to stay here and not flee,\u201d Demasi says.</p> <p>For the youth of Calabria who stay, and get a job, the challenge is huge.</p> <h2><strong>Bavaria</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45e5f8ad88f00a40be262565fd408a0a35f193cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45e5f8ad88f00a40be262565fd408a0a35f193cc/0_192_4645_2787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Munich airport is Upper Bavaria\u2019s largest employer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Munich airport is Upper Bavaria\u2019s largest employer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christof Stache/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stefan Wimmer and Ralf Guttermeyer have wanted to be firemen ever since they can remember. Both aged 17, they are now in the rare position of making their childhood dream a career: seven weeks ago, they became two of four apprentices at Munich airport\u2019s firefighting services.</p> <p>In Upper Bavaria, where the two teenagers live, their chances were always stacked in their favour. At 3.4%, the administrative district in Germany\u2019s south has the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics_at_regional_level\" title=\"\">lowest unemployment rate</a> for people aged 15-24 in the entire European Union. The number of people on Germany\u2019s workfare scheme, Hartz IV, is also lower here than anywhere in the rest of the country.</p> <p>Freising, the district of Upper Bavaria which is now home to Munich\u2019s airport, even trumps that: its adult and youth unemployment rates of 2.1% and 1.9% fall way below the 3% which British economist William Beveridge once defined as amounting to full employment.</p> <p>It is also, incidentally, the administrative district with the lowest average age, 39.7, in an otherwise ageing country. Yet among a population of 590,733, there were last year only 751 young people who were registered as out of work.</p> <p>Asked if they know any peers who couldn\u2019t find a job, the two teenagers have to pause to think. Wimmer has a friend who took a long time to find his first job, \u201cbut, to be honest, that was his own fault\u201d. \u201cIn our region, if you apply yourself, then you\u2019ll get a job appropriate to your skills,\u201d said Guttermeyer.</p> <p>Historically, unemployment in the upper half of Bavaria has fallen and risen in accordance with that in the rest of Germany \u2013 just at a higher level. Even before the city of Munich decided to move its new airport to Freising, the region used to enjoy relatively low levels of people looking for work.</p> <p>Thanks to an unusually broad mix of trades, ranging from car manufacturing to high-end, service-sector jobs, the local job market has, in the past, been able to compensate when certain industries were temporarily in crisis.</p> <p>Many of the companies in the area are medium-sized, <em>Mittelstand</em> businesses: out of about 15,000 businesses in Freising, only 240 have more than 100 employees. A large number are family-run, and therefore less mobile.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a conservative area,\u201d said Harald Brandmaier, a career advisor at Freising job centre. \u201cThey care whether you turn up to work on time, but they also stand their ground and stick with their workforce when the economy hits the buffers for a while.\u201d</p> <p>When Munich airport opened its gates in 1992, it therefore found itself faced with the peculiar logic of a local economy in which employers could not choose from an army of unemployed applicants, but had to actively compete with other businesses to court the best talent in the area.</p> <p>Apprentice fireman Guttermeyer, for example, also got a job offer from BMW, who would have paid him a higher starting salary and picked him up from his doorstep in a shuttle bus every morning. In the end, he opted for the airport because it felt more appealing. He now earns \u20ac860 per month, rising to \u20ac1,000 over the next three years, and rides to work from his parents\u2019 house by motorbike.</p> <p>At Munich airport HQ, the pressure to sell itself to potential new recruits is palpable. Reception areas are plastered with posters advertising the airport as \u201cGermany\u2019s best employer\u201d and Theresa Fleidl, the head of human resources, emphasises that Munich\u2019s is the only airport in the world with its own brewery and indoor wave-riding pool, located between terminals one and two. \u201cWe want to offer our employees a world full of experiences,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The airport is now the region\u2019s largest employer, housing 550 companies with a total of about 35,000 workers.</p> <p>A job market with a chronic undersupply of skilled workforce has also forced newcomers to adopt the area\u2019s traditional labour structures. Germany\u2019s much-admired dual education system (in which apprentices are trained jointly by employers and at specialist vocational schools) has grown in Upper Bavaria, not because it was seen as the more responsible thing to do, but because companies, unable to \u201cbuy in\u201d a fully trained-up workforce, often had to mould the workers they needed themselves.</p> <p>Munich airport, for example, offers young people apprenticeship opportunities in real estate management, even though it could conceivably recruit qualified real estate managers from outside the region. \u201cIn other parts of Europe, the state tries to push everyone into university, and you end up with doctors driving trucks,\u201d said Fleidl. \u201cHere, we get the companies to educate their employees, and they can get exactly the workers they want.\u201d</p>",
