    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hornby, the model train manufacturer that also owns Airfix, is to return some manufacturing from China and India to Britain, becoming the latest UK company to repatriate production because of rising wage costs in emerging markets. The toymaker's announcement was made as figures suggested that Britain's monthly exports to China have hit the \u00a31bn level for the first time, amid signs that UK firms are diversifying away from the crisis-hit eurozone. Hornby said it would be producing a new Airfix range that does not require glue, to be known as Quickbuild, in Sussex. Its chairman, Roger Canham, told Sky News: \"The economics of sourcing our products from China continue to be affected by the reducing availability of labour and increasing costs. In industrialised areas the minimum wage went up by around 15%, with wage inflation slightly ahead of that. You can no longer just apply the rule that manufacturing can be [done] elsewhere.\" Hornby is part of the trend for re- shoring, or returning manufacturing from low-wage Asian economies, which has included UK companies such as Aston Martin, Topshop and Symington's, maker of the Golden Wonder pot noodle. Revealing a rise in British exports to China , the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there had been a marked change in Britain's trade over the past 18 months and the trade gap had narrowed by \u00a3600m in April. Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers' organisation the EEF, said re-shoring should benefit the indebted UK economy and assist exports. \"They would be investing in capacity and modern machinery, potentially increasing their use of local suppliers and supporting the UK's net trade position \u2013 all good for rebalancing away from consumption and towards more trade and investment,\" she said. The latest data indicated that the trade gap in April fell from \u00a33.2bn to \u00a32.6bn as imports fell more sharply than exports. An \u00a38.2bn deficit in goods was partly offset by a \u00a35.6bn surplus in services. Imports and exports fell in April but the 2.7% decline in the value of imports outstripped the 1.3% drop in exports. Over the three months to April \u2013 considered a better guide to the underlying trend by the ONS \u2013 the deficit in goods and services widened by \u00a3500m to \u00a39bn. Since the second half of 2011, exports to the EU have fallen by 5% while those to the rest of the world have risen by 7%. In the quarter ending in April, exports to China were up by 11% and averaged more than \u00a31bn a month. Even so, the trade gap with China has deteriorated because the \u00a3300m increase in exports in the quarter ending in April was accompanied by a \u00a3500m increase in imports. Britain's trading position with the US improved, with a 7% rise in exports and a fall in imports creating a quarterly surplus of \u00a33.7bn. But the deficit with Germany widened markedly. Exports to the UK's second-biggest market \u2013 after the US \u2013 fell by \u00a3800m to \u00a37.5bn while imports were up \u00a3200m to \u00a313.5bn. \"Since the autumn of 2011 the deficit with the non-EU countries averaged around \u00a315bn over a three-month period; the deficit with the rest of the EU was around \u00a311bn. The positions are now reversed,\" said Hopley. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"Overall, it is clear that UK exports are continuing to struggle despite the marked weakening of the pound earlier this year. Obviously, muted and stuttering global growth is a problem, especially persistent weak domestic demand in the eurozone. Nevertheless, the export performance is still disappointing.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u2022 Can we relax? Was Friday's US employment report sufficiently gentle to calm investors and stop them fretting about a potential calamity when the US Federal Reserve starts to withdraw its monetary medicine? It's certainly true that Friday's non-farm payrolls report contained no frightening number. About 175,000 jobs were created in May, consistent with a slow but steady recovery in the US economy. It means the consensus guess doesn't require adjustment: pencil in September or October for the moment the Fed starts to reduce the pace of quantitative easing from $85bn (\u00a355bn) a month. Investors like reassurance and share prices naturally bounced. But relax? No. The story of the past three weeks \u2013 rising bond yields and falling share prices \u2013 is sending several important messages. First, there is a realisation that Ben Bernanke and the Fed face a near-impossible task in getting their timing right. The clamour for an end to QE is growing in the US. House prices are rising again and the argument is made that money needs to be priced \"normally\" to avoid creating the next bubble. Indeed, if you make a couple of optimistic assumptions (like job creation at an average of 250,000 a month from here) the Fed could meet its target of a 6.5% unemployment rate as early as next summer. So hurry up with the QE reduction, goes that line of reasoning, we're no longer in crisis. Yet the US recovery also looks extremely fragile. This week's data showed a sharp fall in manufacturing activity. There is clearly a serious risk QE could start to be withdrawn at precisely the wrong moment. Second, the east is now a worry. This week's talking point has been China, where Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's analyst pointed out that credit is growing twice as fast as the economy. That debt binge looks unsustainable for long. In the meantime, Japan has launched a huge stimulus package. But the first effect has been a rollercoaster ride in the yen that may be sowing more confusion than confidence in Japanese boardrooms. Third, the eurozone crisis festers. Not that you'd notice from the comments of Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, who would rather his (untested) promise to buy the bonds of peripheral nations was hailed as \"probably the most successful monetary policy of recent times\". The ranks of the eurozone unemployed (the rate stands at a colossal 12.2%) may not agree. Recession continues while banking union and the other grand ideas proceed at a crawl. Add it all up and a tepid US jobs report really counts for little. The big picture remains unaltered: ultra-loose monetary policy has produced only an ultra-slow economic recovery. The risk of a relapse as the US withdraws QE is real. The Fed is probably obliged to act but it cannot really know what will follow. \u2022 Steve Groves is an \"actuarial genius,\" they say. He's certainly doing something right. The chief executive of Partnership Assurance, which on Friday made a storming \u00a31.5bn stock market debut, saw his stake valued at \u00a355m. He's banked a quarter and kept the rest. Not bad at the age of 38, and not bad for pursuing an idea that should been adopted by the mainstream insurance brigade a couple of decades ago. Partnership's model is quite simple: instead of collecting only rudimentary data on new pensioners, such as how many major illnesses they've had and how many cigarettes they smoke, it does a proper job of estimating life expectancy. It asks 250 questions. If your health profile is poor enough, Partnership might be able to offer you a better income in the form of a \"non-standard\" annuity. Gruesome? More like hard-headed. The logic is sound: the pension pots of those with \"medical and lifestyle conditions,\" in Partnership's polite phrasing, should be able to buy a superior annuity. That's life, and death. Why didn't the big insurers take up the model years ago? The answer, one suspects, is that the annuity game in the UK has been too cosy and too profitable for the big boys for too long. The game is changing, of course, as regulators and consumer groups yell at annuity buyers to shop around. But is this development good or bad for Partnership? The pool of potential customers ought to be larger. On the other hand, having the likes of Legal &amp; General and Aviva throw their bigger balance sheets into the ring would change the competitive picture. Partnership's view is that the 18 years of accumulated data in its mortality database represents the real competitive advantage. Wishful thinking? Quite possibly, but there's always a chance that a big insurer decides the easiest way to deal with a new competitor is to buy it. It wouldn't be the first time. \u2022 \"I think I've turned AHL around,\" Manny Roman, Man Group's new shareholder-friendly chief executive, told the FT in March. He spoke too soon. AHL, a computer-driven momentum fund, was indeed spitting out better performance numbers in the first quarter of this year, and continued to do so in April. But May proved horrible. Man revealed this week that all AHL's gain of 12% this year evaporated in a fortnight. That's the problem with trend-following investment strategies: profits tend to accumulate gradually but losses can arrive suddenly. In this case, the sudden sell-off in bond markets did the damage. The disappointment whacked Man's share price for good reason. AHL was within a whisker of passing its 2010 high-water mark, which is when the big performance-related fees would have kicked in, but now finds itself back down the slippery slope. AHL's system is not broken, sings Man's fan club, it just needs less volatile and choppy markets. The analysis is probably correct, and it's also true that there will always be an audience for this type of alternative investment product. In the jargon, it offers \"uncorrelated\" returns that can serve as a useful protection. For example, the AHL computer simply loved the banking blow-up and bursting of the commodity bubble \u2013 it was up 19% in 2007 and 33% in 2008. The trouble is, memories are short, many of AHL's rivals have done better in the past three years and money can move home easily. In AHL's glory days, the fund was easily the biggest beast in the trend-following game with $27bn under management in 2009. Now it has about $14bn v arch-rival Winton's $25bn. Now there's a proper trend.",

      "body": "<p>\u2022 Can we relax? Was Friday's US employment report sufficiently gentle to calm investors and stop them fretting about a potential calamity when the US Federal Reserve starts to withdraw its monetary medicine?</p> <p>It's certainly true that Friday's non-farm payrolls report contained no frightening number. About 175,000 jobs were created in May, consistent with a slow but steady recovery in the US economy.</p> <p>It means the consensus guess doesn't require adjustment: pencil in September or October for the moment the Fed starts to reduce the pace of quantitative easing from $85bn (\u00a355bn) a month. Investors like reassurance and share prices naturally bounced.</p> <p>But relax? No. The story of the past three weeks \u2013 rising bond yields and falling share prices \u2013 is sending several important messages.</p> <p>First, there is a realisation that Ben Bernanke and the Fed face a near-impossible task in getting their timing right. The clamour for an end to QE is growing in the US. House prices are rising again and the argument is made that money needs to be priced \"normally\" to avoid creating the next bubble. Indeed, if you make a couple of optimistic assumptions (like job creation at an average of 250,000 a month from here) the Fed could meet its target of a 6.5% unemployment rate as early as next summer. So hurry up with the QE reduction, goes that line of reasoning, we're no longer in crisis.</p> <p>Yet the US recovery also looks extremely fragile. This week's data showed a sharp fall in manufacturing activity. There is clearly a serious risk QE could start to be withdrawn at precisely the wrong moment.</p> <p>Second, the east is now a worry. This week's talking point has been China, where Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's analyst pointed out that credit is growing twice as fast as the economy.

      "standfirst": "On paper, 175,000 jobs added sounds good. To the 12 million Americans still unemployed, it just means their misery goes on", 
      "body": "<p>Friday we found out that 175,000 new jobs were created in May, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/07/us-economy-jobs-unemployment-rise\">according to the number-crunchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Here's the buzzkill: this is not actually good news.</p> <p>It's hard to celebrate just because the economy added 10,000 more jobs than the \"consensus\" of experts believed it would. In the world of some economists, that's wonderful \u2013 for ego reasons. These economists treat the jobs numbers like baseball playoffs \u2013 numbers on a scoreboard, and cheers when your team wins \u2013 instead of what the data really tell us.</p> <p>What they tell us is an indication of how many Americans will continue to suffer joblessness long-term through a weak recovery. For the 12 million people still unemployed in the US, for the unprecedented number of Americans on food stamps, it's hard to take any real comfort from the fact that a database ticked upward by 10,000 jobs \u2013 and thus gratified someone sitting in a cubicle who'd picked a number out of a hat. </p> <p>Trusting the initial monthly numbers is, in any case, a fool's errand: every month, the BLS warns that its initial jobs numbers could be wrong \u2013 <em>by 100,000 jobs</em>. As a testament to the unreliability of these monthly numbers, Friday's release also included a pretty important revision downwards to last month's numbers, by 16,000 jobs.</p> <p>And there are reasons why May's job gains themselves are less than totally satisfying. Many of the <a href=\"http://www.nelp.org/index.php/content/content_about_us/tracking_the_recovery_after_the_great_recession\">gains were largely in low-paying retail positions</a>, which the economy has been adding at roughly twice the rate of middle-class jobs. Better-paying sectors like manufacturing are still suffering. </p> <p>Overall, the economy has lost roughly 8.8 million jobs since 2008; it has replaced less than one quarter of those since.

      "bodyText": "Friday we found out that 175,000 new jobs were created in May, according to the number-crunchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here's the buzzkill: this is not actually good news. It's hard to celebrate just because the economy added 10,000 more jobs than the \"consensus\" of experts believed it would. In the world of some economists, that's wonderful \u2013 for ego reasons. These economists treat the jobs numbers like baseball playoffs \u2013 numbers on a scoreboard, and cheers when your team wins \u2013 instead of what the data really tell us. What they tell us is an indication of how many Americans will continue to suffer joblessness long-term through a weak recovery. For the 12 million people still unemployed in the US, for the unprecedented number of Americans on food stamps, it's hard to take any real comfort from the fact that a database ticked upward by 10,000 jobs \u2013 and thus gratified someone sitting in a cubicle who'd picked a number out of a hat. Trusting the initial monthly numbers is, in any case, a fool's errand: every month, the BLS warns that its initial jobs numbers could be wrong \u2013 by 100,000 jobs. As a testament to the unreliability of these monthly numbers, Friday's release also included a pretty important revision downwards to last month's numbers, by 16,000 jobs. And there are reasons why May's job gains themselves are less than totally satisfying. Many of the gains were largely in low-paying retail positions, which the economy has been adding at roughly twice the rate of middle-class jobs. Better-paying sectors like manufacturing are still suffering. Overall, the economy has lost roughly 8.8 million jobs since 2008; it has replaced less than one quarter of those since. We haven't come anywhere near closing the gap with employment in 2007, before the crisis ravaged the picture. The unemployment rate for women, for instance, declined to 6.5% this month \u2013 but still towers above the 4.5% it was in 2007, according to the National Women's Law Center. Other measures of \"recovery\" prove untrustworthy. The much-ballyhooed increase in household wealth recently was primarily due to rising house prices \u2013 and only 19% of home sales are to first-time homebuyers; the rest are primarily going to Wall Street. Even if one chooses to be optimistic about the numbers, Paul Edelstein and Stephanie Karol of IHS Global Insight indicated that the continuing push from austerity will destroy whatever small gains we are likely to make: \"The likelihood that this pace of jobs growth will persist in the face of the spending sequester, however, is unlikely.\" For these reasons and more, the monthly numbers are misleading, and optimism is often swiftly punished.

      "bodyText": "Vodafone, the world's second largest mobile phone company by revenue, paid no corporation tax in Britain last year. The blue chip company has distributed \u00a34.8bn in cash dividends to shareholders in the last 12 months \u2013 more than any other British business \u2013 but generous tax breaks mean it was able to reduce its corporation tax bill to zero for the second consecutive year. Vodafone's annual report, published on Friday, also showed the chief executive, Vittorio Colao, collected \u00a311m in pay last financial year. The total included salary, fees, a cash bonus, stock options, cash paid in lieu of a contribution to the company pension scheme and \u00a330,000 in benefits, such as private healthcare and car allowance. Tough trading in southern Europe, which is bearing the brunt of the economic crisis in the eurozone andwhere Vodafone's businesses' operating profits have contracted by 28%, meant Colao missed some of his performance targets and will take home less than the \u00a315.7m he earned in 2011-12. Despite being headquartered in Britain, Vodafone regularly pays more tax abroad than it does in its home country. Last year, the group's international tax bill totalled \u00a32.6bn. Instead of being taxed at group level, UK law allows companies to be charged through their subsidiaries. Vodafone has many subsidiaries \u2013 the annual report lists 79 of them \u2013 each of which is taxed as a separate entity. In common with many other UK businesses, Vodafone's British operating company is able to shelter much of its profit from tax legally. The firm made a \u00a3294m operating profit in Britain last year, but was able to transform that into a loss. In common with other mobile phone networks, Vodafone claimed back part of the money it has spent on its network, building masts and laying cables. It also claimed back part of the cash it paid the government to buy the airwaves that carry mobile traffic, as well as interest charges on the money it borrowed to pay for them. \"This shows all that is wrong with the current system for taxing corporations, which has made tax almost a voluntary activity,\" said Prem Sikka, professor of accounting at the University of Essex. \"We have the fiction that hundreds of Vodafone subsidiaries all over the world are separate taxpaying entities, even though the company has common shareholders, a common board, and common strategy. It should really be treated as a single economic entity so that none of this profit would escape tax.\" Although Vodafone's tax bill for the year was zero, a recalculation of money owed for previous years meant it received a \u00a324m bill from HM Revenue and Customs. This compares to a \u00a34m credit for recalculated tax last year. In a nine-page document published as a defence of its tax position, Vodafone said it contributed \u00a311.1bn in 2011-12 to public finances in the countries where it operates. This figure includes corporation tax, but also spectrum fees, incidentals such as vehicle excise duty and the income tax collected from some staff. \"Individuals and companies have legal obligations to pay tax,\" the document states, \"but those obligations do not extend to paying more than the amount legally required. Companies also have a legal obligation to act in the interests of their shareholders. Vodafone's shareholders include many of the investment funds relied upon by tens of millions of individual pensioners and savers.\" Vodafone's stock price has risen 13% since last June. It is the largest dividend payer in the FTSE 100, thanks to its 45% ownership of the US mobile network Verizon Wireless, which has itself been paying generous dividends to Vodafone. In light of the economic crisis in Europe, where Vodafone was forced to write down the value of its Italian and Spanish operations by \u00a37.7bn, Colao's pay is to be frozen for a second year running, along with that of most of his top team. \"When considering what, if any, pay increases to award, the committee is always mindful of both wider conditions as well as what is happening elsewhere within Vodafone,\" Luc Vandevelde, the chairman of the remuneration committee, wrote in the annual report. Colao's annual salary and fees were worth more than \u00a31m this year. In addition he received \u00a3333,000 cash in lieu of pension. He received \u00a38.25m in shares and a \u00a31.313m cash bonus.",

Tesco and Asda were both selling bananas for 68p a kilo on Friday. Banana Link said the crisis showed that \"bananas on the cheap \u2026 are simply not sustainable\". Tropical fruit company Fyffes, a major importer of bananas into Europe, said it was monitoring the situation. \"Contingency plans are being put in place to minimise any impact on customers should the strike go ahead,\" a spokeswoman told the Grocer. According to the magazine, Colombian workers are seeking a two-year pay deal that gives them an 8% pay rise in the first year, followed by a 5% rise in the second. \"We recognise that the industry is facing a serious crisis, but it is not for workers to pay the price of a crisis that only the companies and the government can resolve,\" the president of Sintrainagro, the Colombian agricultural workers' union, has said.",

Our correspondent in Athens Helena Smith writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>More than three years after the debt crisis exploded in Greece, the desire to see punishment meted out to those blamed for bringing the country to the verge of economic collapse, has reached boiling point. Against this backdrop, the Greek parliament voted overwhelmingly on Thursday (234 MPS in the 300-member House)&#xa0;to step up charges against former finance minister George Papaconstantinou, adding the accusation of criminal breach of trust in the ongoing investigation into his handling of the list.</p> <p>The erstwhile politician already stands accused of doctoring the catalogue of over 2,000 wealthy Greeks with accounts at the Geneva branch of HSBC in a bid to delete the names of three of his relatives included on it. He has also been charged with dereliction of duty for failing to use the data and track down tax dodgers. The latest charge, however, trumps the initial accusations and could mean jail if he is convicted. Addressing parliament ahead of the secret ballot, Papaconstantinou who is widely seen as the architect of Greece\u2019s first austerity programme, repeated that he was being made a scapegoat.</p> <p>\u201cThe aim here is not to serve justice, unfortunately the aim is to find a political victim,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is that, as a finance minister, I was forced to make cuts so that my country wouldn\u2019t collapse.\u201d</p> <p>Greece was the only EU country not to act on the list - first dispensed by French authorities - of its own citizens with deposits stashed abroad. A special parliamentary committee investigating officials\u2019 controversial handling of the data is expected to deliver a verdict later this month. If found guilty by the committee, public prosecutors will in turn have to decide whether to put Papaconstantinou on trial.</p> <p>Meanwhile the country\u2019s finances go from bad to worse.

The weak global economy is still taking a toll, with manufacturing payrolls falling by 8,000 last month. And the squeeze on government spending is also to blame as government payrolls fell by 3,000. This would have been worse if local governments hadn\u2019t added 13,000 workers...</p> <p>The weak tone of the recent survey evidence suggests payrolls may weaken a bit in the coming months. But we don\u2019t think it will be long before they return to gains of around 180,000 a month. If that is the case by the time the Fed meets in September, then it will probably trim the pace of its monthly asset purchases.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Tanweer Akram, senior economist at ING Investment Management, </strong>says the US labour market continues to show \"decent progress\" but he highlights that the <strong>U-6 rate of unemployment</strong> - a broader measure that includes marginally attached and discouraged workers in the unemployment calculation - is still \"elevated\" at <strong>13.8%</strong>. He continues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the year the labour force participation rate has actually <em>declined</em> 0.4 percentage point. Meanwhile inflationary pressures are notably below the Fed\u2019s long-term target.</p> <p>This analyst\u2019s view is that the FOMC will remain cautious and not alter its program of asset purchase in the next two meetings (June and July), but it may downwardly adjust the <em>pace</em> of asset purchases in September provided the labour market continues to make decent progress so that the unemployment rate declines.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-06-07T15:21:03.505Z\">at 4.21pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51b1d895e4b0cc6424372185\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-07T12:57:00.495Z\">1.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Payrolls report boosts stocks</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>First up, for readers wanting to go through <strong>full report on US jobs</strong> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it can be found <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\">here</a>.</p> <p>A quick summary of markets following the keenly awaited data:</p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is up 24 points to 6360</p> <p>The <strong>CAC40</strong> is up 14 points at 3828</p> <p>The <strong>Dax</strong> is up 38 points at 8137</p> <p>On <strong>bond and currency markets</strong> trading is choppy after a bit of a mixed bag of news from the payrolls report.

Any reading in-line with consensus or lower will support the view of continued purchases by the Fed under their QE programmes, and reduce any expectation of tapering in the near-term. In contrast, a reading above 200k could renew talk of a decision to begin tapering at the next couple of FOMC meetings, and hence volatile price-swings could be observed across asset classes.</p> </blockquote> <p>Rob Carnell at ING Financial Markets says it is the unemployment rate that is key in today's report.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In recent months, the Fed\u2019s promotion of the unemployment rate to its principal (if not sole) target, has rather relegated the importance of the non-farm payrolls element of the labour report. So even though the combined messages from yesterday\u2019s ADP report, and the employment index of the non-manufacturing ISM suggest that job creation is proceeding at only a reasonable, maybe even reduced pace of about 130-150K ... this says little if anything about the direction of the unemployment rate... we suspect that the 7.5% unemployment rate will remain unchanged this month, which absent a shockingly large (or very small) payrolls figure, may take some of the selling pressure off US Treasuries in the short term. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51b1a464e4b0bfa7376c477a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-07T09:14:17.600Z\">10.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK trade data add to &quot;growing list of positive economic news&quot;</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some reactions to that UK trade data now, which are welcomed by some as positive news on the economy while others are noting that a drop in imports, not the much needed growth in exports, drove that narrowing in the trade gap in April.</p> <p>Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Ecnomics says</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>April\u2019s UK trade figures add to the growing list of positive economic news...</p> <p>These figures therefore set the second quarter off to a fairly good start and tentatively suggest that net trade might be playing some role in the apparent acceleration in economic growth shown by the business surveys.

      "bodyText": "Over in Greece there have been developments in the ongoing drama over the infamous \"Lagarde list\" of tax evaders following a parliamentary vote to widen charges against the country\u2019s former finance minister George Papaconstantinou. Our correspondent in Athens Helena Smith writes: More than three years after the debt crisis exploded in Greece, the desire to see punishment meted out to those blamed for bringing the country to the verge of economic collapse, has reached boiling point. Against this backdrop, the Greek parliament voted overwhelmingly on Thursday (234 MPS in the 300-member House) to step up charges against former finance minister George Papaconstantinou, adding the accusation of criminal breach of trust in the ongoing investigation into his handling of the list. The erstwhile politician already stands accused of doctoring the catalogue of over 2,000 wealthy Greeks with accounts at the Geneva branch of HSBC in a bid to delete the names of three of his relatives included on it. He has also been charged with dereliction of duty for failing to use the data and track down tax dodgers. The latest charge, however, trumps the initial accusations and could mean jail if he is convicted. Addressing parliament ahead of the secret ballot, Papaconstantinou who is widely seen as the architect of Greece\u2019s first austerity programme, repeated that he was being made a scapegoat. \u201cThe aim here is not to serve justice, unfortunately the aim is to find a political victim,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is that, as a finance minister, I was forced to make cuts so that my country wouldn\u2019t collapse.\u201d Greece was the only EU country not to act on the list - first dispensed by French authorities - of its own citizens with deposits stashed abroad. A special parliamentary committee investigating officials\u2019 controversial handling of the data is expected to deliver a verdict later this month. If found guilty by the committee, public prosecutors will in turn have to decide whether to put Papaconstantinou on trial. Meanwhile the country\u2019s finances go from bad to worse. Earlier today the nation\u2019s statistics agency, ELSTAT, announced that the Greek economy contracted by 5.6 percent in the first quarter of this year. And on that note, we're closing up for the weekend. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back again on Monday. ECB chief Mario Draghi disappointed markets by seemingly playing down further action to help boost the flagging eurozone economy. But according to a Reuters story, Italy's economy minister Fabrizio Saccomanni has just said Draghi was \"a little misunderstood\" and was open to taking more expansive measures. After a fairly dismal week, markets have ended on an upbeat note, and it is mainly thanks to the US non-farm payroll numbers, writes Nick Fletcher. The jobs rise of 175,000 was good enough to ease concerns about the state of the world's largest economy, but not so good that investors believed the Federal Reserve would ease off on its bond buying programme in the immediate future. Here's the closing scores for the European markets: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 75.88 points or 1.2% higher at 6411.99 \u2022 Germany's Dax ended 1.92% better at 8254.68 \u2022 France's Cac closed up 1.53% at 3872.59 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB finished 1% higher at 16,691.06 \u2022 Spain's Ibex added 0.61% to 8266.6 \u2022 The Athens market rose 0.93% to 986.05 Meanwhile in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up nearly 200 points or 1.3% by the time London closed. A quick summary of today\u2019s events. As expected, market news around the world was dominated by the US non-farm payrolls report, which on the surface, at least, beat expectations. \u2022 The US added 175,000 non-farm jobs in May, more than expected. The unemployment rate rose to 7.6% \u2022 The Bundesbank cut its outlook for German growth this year and next \u2022 German trade data showed a pick-up in exports and imports \u2022 UK data showed the trade gap narrowed as imports fell \u2022 The IFS says Britain faces two austerity elections \u2022 Gold slid, the dollar rallied and stocks gained after the payrolls report bolstered expectations the US Federal Reserve will keep up its economic support In the UK, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has issued a bleak assessment of chancellor George Osborne's deficit reduction plan. My colleague Nicholas Watt reports that Britain faces at least two consecutive \"austerity\" general elections in 2015 and 2020, according to the thinktank. He writes: The winner of the next election, which will probably be in 2015, will have to impose further spending cuts of \u00a323bn over the first full two years of the next parliament after the chancellor's pledge in 2010 to eliminate the structural budget deficit was \"blown off course\". In a paper compiled jointly with the Institute for Government (IFG) before Osborne's spending review statement for 2015-16 on 26 June, the IFS said: \"We should expect not just 2015 but also 2020 to be an austerity election. Spending reductions are set to be a long-term feature of the UK's public finances, rather than a short and sharp experience. When the chancellor stands up to speak on 26 June 2013 will he be frank about the long-term reality of austerity?\" More here. Wall Street has opened higher after the take on the latest labour market data from the US is largely that it is not so good the Federal Reserve will withdraw its economic support any time soon. In Europe, France, Germany and the UK's leading indices have all extended gains. Here is a quick summary: France's CAC40 up 17 points to 3831 Germany's Dax up 49 points to 8148 UK's FTSE 100 up 60 points to 6396 Dow Jones industrial average up 127 points to 15167 Nasdaq up 20 points to 3444 S&amp;P 500 up 5 points to 1627 Elsewhere on financial markets, gold has sold off by more than 2% and the dollar has strengthened against the euro and yen following the payrolls report. Reactions are coming in from economists to the US non-farm payrolls rise of 175,000 in May and there appears to be a sense of relief. The outturn was not so strong as to see the Federal Reserve stepping back from its economy-boosting action and it was not so weak as to spark fears about the overall pace of US recovery. Paul Dales, senior US economist at Capital Economics, says the report leaves the Fed on track to taper its latest quantitative easing measures later this year. Looking at the details, he adds: May\u2019s gain was better than April\u2019s 149,000 rise (revised down from 165,000) and takes jobs growth a bit closer to the monthly average of 200,000 seen in the previous six months. The weak global economy is still taking a toll, with manufacturing payrolls falling by 8,000 last month. And the squeeze on government spending is also to blame as government payrolls fell by 3,000. This would have been worse if local governments hadn\u2019t added 13,000 workers... The weak tone of the recent survey evidence suggests payrolls may weaken a bit in the coming months. But we don\u2019t think it will be long before they return to gains of around 180,000 a month. If that is the case by the time the Fed meets in September, then it will probably trim the pace of its monthly asset purchases. Tanweer Akram, senior economist at ING Investment Management, says the US labour market continues to show \"decent progress\" but he highlights that the U-6 rate of unemployment - a broader measure that includes marginally attached and discouraged workers in the unemployment calculation - is still \"elevated\" at 13.8%. He continues: Over the year the labour force participation rate has actually declined 0.4 percentage point. Meanwhile inflationary pressures are notably below the Fed\u2019s long-term target. This analyst\u2019s view is that the FOMC will remain cautious and not alter its program of asset purchase in the next two meetings (June and July), but it may downwardly adjust the pace of asset purchases in September provided the labour market continues to make decent progress so that the unemployment rate declines. First up, for readers wanting to go through full report on US jobs from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it can be found here. A quick summary of markets following the keenly awaited data: The FTSE 100 is up 24 points to 6360 The CAC40 is up 14 points at 3828 The Dax is up 38 points at 8137 On bond and currency markets trading is choppy after a bit of a mixed bag of news from the payrolls report. The dollar briefly pared losses against the yen and rose against the euro. US government bond prices dipped then recovered. Some Twitter reactions summarising the payrolls report: Payrolls have beaten expectations in terms of jobs added but the jobless rate has unexpectedly risen. The US economy added 175,000 non-farm jobs in May, following a downwardly revised gain of 149,000 in April. That compares with a consensus forecast for 170,000 jobs to be added in May in a Reuters poll of economists. The unemployment rate rose to 7.6%, versus expectations for it to hold at 7.5%. With just under one hour to go until the latest non-farm payrolls report on the US jobs market at 1.30pm UK time, stock markets in Europe are lower. As we discussed earlier, the pervading feeling in the market is that a downside surprise is more likely than an upside surprise. The consensus is for 170,000 non-farm jobs to have been added in May, according to a Reuters poll of economists. But that was taken before a report on private sector employers undershot expectations this week. Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank International, says that reports this week \"have hinted that the May US payrolls data may at best show a moderate improvement\" on the 165,000 added in April. She continues: Even if the headline NFP data does not disappoint it will still be possible to pick holes in the US labour market report today because labour force participation is low and the average duration of a spate of joblessness is still high (though off its peak) compared with other post war recoveries. The FTSE 100 in London is now down 6 points at 6330, Germany's Dax is down 30 points at 8069 and France's CAC40 is down 1 point at 3813. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, has been looking at the latest UK trade data and the milestone of Britain\u2019s monthly exports to China reaching the \u00a31bn level for the first time. He writes: The Office for National Statistics said there had been a marked shift in Britain\u2019s trading patterns over the past 18 months as it revealed that the country\u2019s trade gap narrowed by \u00a3600m in April... Both imports and exports fell in April, but the 2.7% decline in the value of imports outstripped the 1.3% drop in exports. Over the three months to April \u2013 considered a better guide to the underlying trend by the ONS \u2013 the deficit in goods and services widened by \u00a3500m to \u00a39bn. The UK data, which as we mentioned earlier promoted mixed reactions from economists, contrast quite strongly with a more more robust trade picture out of Germany. Exports there in April rose a monthly 1.9% and imports by 2.3%, official data showed. Stock markets around Europe are little changed as traders await those non-farm payrolls numbers later today. My colleague Nick Fletcher has more details on our Market Forces blog. And here is how things stand for now: UK's FTSE 100 is up 5 points, 0.1% at 6341 France's CAC40 is up 3 points, 0.1%, at 3817 Germany's Dax is down 16 points, 0.1%, at 8083 The pound is near a four-month high against the dollar and on track for its strongest weekly performance since October 2009, having hit $1.5685 yesterday. The euro has stabilised against the dollar somewhat this morning after having jumped to a three-month high yesterday of $1.3306. It is currently at $1.3252. A quick preview now of US non-farm payrolls data due at 1.30pm UK time. Although economists had been forecasting a slight improvement for May, traders and analysts now say the main risk is the actual numbers undershoot that. It is a notoriously hard release to call, but the consensus is for 170,000 jobs to have been added in May. That compares with 165,000 reported in April. The unemployment rate is seen holding at 7.5%. The ADP National Employment Report on jobs added by private employers on Wednesday missed economists\u2019 expectations and so the feeling now is payrolls could be below rather than above that consensus 170,000 forecast. The numbers drum up a lot of pre-release fuss every month, quite often only to be followed by a lacklustre reaction when they finally come out. But \u2018this time it\u2019s different\u2019 is the cry from analysts in their swathe of previews today. They argue the May employment outcome will be key to gauging what happens next with the Federal Reserve\u2019s stimulus programme - will it or won\u2019t it be scaled back in the coming months? RANsquawk, the market analysts, say this month\u2019s report is \u201cparticularly important\u201d as the data set is the \u201cmost keenly followed economic indicator by the Federal Reserve.\u201d They say: The bulk of estimates lie between 150k to 180k, below the current six month average of 200k, which is a monthly job gain target seen by many Fed members as indicating jobs growth sufficient enough to bring unemployment down and hence reduce the current rate of large scale Treasury and MBS buys. Any reading in-line with consensus or lower will support the view of continued purchases by the Fed under their QE programmes, and reduce any expectation of tapering in the near-term. In contrast, a reading above 200k could renew talk of a decision to begin tapering at the next couple of FOMC meetings, and hence volatile price-swings could be observed across asset classes. Rob Carnell at ING Financial Markets says it is the unemployment rate that is key in today's report. In recent months, the Fed\u2019s promotion of the unemployment rate to its principal (if not sole) target, has rather relegated the importance of the non-farm payrolls element of the labour report. So even though the combined messages from yesterday\u2019s ADP report, and the employment index of the non-manufacturing ISM suggest that job creation is proceeding at only a reasonable, maybe even reduced pace of about 130-150K ... this says little if anything about the direction of the unemployment rate... we suspect that the 7.5% unemployment rate will remain unchanged this month, which absent a shockingly large (or very small) payrolls figure, may take some of the selling pressure off US Treasuries in the short term. Some reactions to that UK trade data now, which are welcomed by some as positive news on the economy while others are noting that a drop in imports, not the much needed growth in exports, drove that narrowing in the trade gap in April. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Ecnomics says April\u2019s UK trade figures add to the growing list of positive economic news... These figures therefore set the second quarter off to a fairly good start and tentatively suggest that net trade might be playing some role in the apparent acceleration in economic growth shown by the business surveys. That said, with survey measures of export orders still mediocre and the euro-zone still in recession, it seems unlikely that net trade will provide a significant support to the overall recovery in the coming few months. But Ross Walker at Royal Bank of Scotland tells Reuters: If you look at import and export numbers on an underlying basis, much of the improvement is that imports are falling, not that exports are rising. There's only limited evidence at best of a rebalancing on the trade side. There is a marginal improvement. We will have a modest boost to GDP from net trade, but it is ... certainly not plugging the gap in domestic demand. The UK's trade balance has narrowed after a sharp fall in imports in April, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. It says that the goods trade deficit fell to \u00a38.224bn from \u00a39.175bn in March. That was a smaller gap than the \u00a38.8bn forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. The ONS reports: The value of UK exports decreased by 1.3% between March 2013 and April 2013. The value of imports decreased by 2.7% over the same period. The narrowing of the deficit in April is mainly due to the UK's trade in goods with the EU, particularly that it was estimated that imports from the EU fell by around \u00a31.3 billion. We are not the only ones to pick up on the oddly cheerful introduction from the Bundesbank to its downgraded German growth outlook More now from the Bundesbank\u2019s latest projections for the German economy. In its monthly report the Bundesbank maintains a message of reforms being essential to stabilise the eurozone economy, currently in its sixth quarter of contraction. The Bundesbank appears worried that things have relaxed somewhat. The report says: Consolidation and reform efforts appear to be slackening. This could have a negative effect on the financial markets and further intensify the debt crises. Confidence would then be further eroded, which would also have negative consequences for the cyclical outlook for the German economy. It also sees risks further afield to German exports: The sustained global economic revival is another important prerequisite for the growth path presented here. However, some emerging market economies are showing cyclical slowdowns as well as structural distortions, which could impair demand for German products. Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s eurozone crisis live blog. We will be bringing you news from throughout the eurozone and from the US, where this afternoon the latest non-farm payrolls are published - one of those events market players get very excited about and also find very hard to call. Anticipation of those numbers at 1.30pm UK time on how many jobs have been added - the consensus forecast is around 170,000 - and the US unemployment rate is keeping stock market activity in Europe subdued for now. More on the payrolls report later. But first, news from Germany where the Bundesbank is blaming external demand for a cut to its growth forecast this morning. The country\u2019s central bank now believes the German economy will grow just 0.3% this year, cutting its forecast from 0.4%. For 2014, its forecast is 1.5% growth, down from 1.9% previously. The move follows the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) move to slash its German 2013 growth forecast in half to 0.3% earlier this week, blaming eurozone uncertainty. The Bundesbank says its new forecasts reflect a view that exports will rise slower than imports. Its latest outlook starts off cheerfully enough before moving on to a \u201cmajor strain\u201d on Germany\u2019s economy. The outlook for the German economy has become brighter again following the slowdown towards the end of 2012.The world economy will gain momentum in the course of this year. In the euro area, too, the economy appears to be bottoming out. Nevertheless, the Bundesbank sees continuing structural problems as standing in the way of a rapid improvement. This is likely to place a major strain on the German economy, which is integrated into the international division of labour. Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann adds: Much will depend on whether the economic situation stabilises in the euro-area crisis countries and whether expansionary forces will gradually gain the upper hand there.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's monthly exports to China have hit the \u00a31bn level for the first time amid signs that UK firms are diversifying away from the crisis-hit eurozone. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a marked shift in Britain's trading patterns over the past 18 months as it revealed that the country's trade gap narrowed by \u00a3600m in April. Latest data showed that the trade gap in April fell from \u00a33.2bn to \u00a32.6bn as imports fell more sharply than exports. An \u00a38.2bn deficit in goods was partly offset by a \u00a35.6bn surplus in trade in services. Both imports and exports fell in April, but the 2.7% decline in the value of imports outstripped the 1.3% drop in exports. Over the three months to April \u2013 considered a better guide to the underlying trend by the ONS \u2013 the deficit in goods and services widened by \u00a3500m to \u00a39bn. Since the second half of 2011, exports to the EU have fallen by 5% while those to the rest of the world have risen by 7%. In the quarter ending in April, exports to China were up by 11% and averaged more than \u00a31bn a month. Even so, the trade gap with China deteriorated since the \u00a3300m increase in exports in the quarter ending in April was accompanied by a \u00a3500m increase in imports. Britain's trading position with the US improved, with a 7% rise in exports and a fall in imports creating a quarterly surplus of \u00a33.7bn. But the deficit with Germany widened markedly. Exports to the UK's second-biggest market after the US fell by \u00a3800m to \u00a37.5bn while imports were up \u00a3200m to \u00a313.5bn. \"There has been a switch in the trade with EU countries and the rest of the world since the autumn of 2011,\" the ONS said. \"In that period, the deficit with the non-EU countries averaged around \u00a315bn over a three-month period; the deficit with the rest of the EU was around \u00a311bn. The positions are now reversed.\" Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"Overall, it is clear that UK exports are continuing to struggle despite the marked weakening of the pound earlier this year. Obviously, muted and stuttering global growth is a problem, especially persistent weak domestic demand in the eurozone. Nevertheless, the export performance is still disappointing.\"",

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch, via his Twitter account, recently put forth some views on Australia\u2019s economy. He handily numbered them for us: Now I won\u2019t get snippy and point out that number two seems to have been mislaid (OK, yes I just did do that). But let us have a look at these points. Well, if the problem ahead is that exports are falling, then he\u2019s expecting a change in the future from what is happening now. As I noted in an article earlier today \u2013 we are currently moving out of the investment side of the mining boom and into the exporting part of it. Monday\u2019s balance of payments data showed that our volume of exports was up 1.1% in the March quarter and a quite strong 8% in the past 12 months: Now, if we have extreme labour costs here you would think that might be reflected in a zooming increase in the wages price index. During Senate estimates on Thursday, the Treasury secretary, Martin Parkinson, pointed to the index as being the best guide for wages growth. Well, it\u2019s not just flat, it is actually down: We could even use labour costs which came out with the GDP figures on Wednesday. Both real and nominal labour costs fell in the quarters. Real unit labour costs had risen recently, but mostly because inflation (as calculated for the national accounts) had gone negative \u2013 that is prices were falling, not rising. Does Rupert really think a wages fall in nominal terms would be good for the country? Finally, the dollar is not the Newspoll of Australia. It is neither good nor bad. A high dollar gives benefits such as lower inflation through cheaper imports. But if you want to help out exports then the last thing you would bemoan is a falling dollar \u2013 that would actually help exporters! Let\u2019s get some context on the value of the dollar. It is now around US$0.95. The average since the float in 1983 is $0.75. We are long way from becoming some junk currency. And as for his \"big vision for the north\"? This would be the same one that the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce looked into in 2010 on \u201csustainable development of northern Australia\u201d and found, \u201ccontrary to popular belief, water resources in the north are neither unlimited, nor wasted. Equally, the potential for northern Australia to become a \u2018food bowl\u2019 is not supported by evidence.\u201d Well, they\u2019re only tweets. And it\u2019s not like anyone pays attention to what some bloke says on Twitter.",
