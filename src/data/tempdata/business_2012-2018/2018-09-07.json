      "bodyText": "Ryanair cabin crew have said they are considering the biggest strikes in the airline\u2019s history unless it agrees to improved working conditions. The Dublin-based airline suffered its worst ever strikes this summer, as action by pilots and cabin crew forced it to cancel flights, including to major holiday destinations such as Italy, Portugal and Spain. It secured a breakthrough in August after reaching a deal with striking Irish pilots and said it was hopeful it could secure deals in other markets. But on Friday unions representing cabin crew in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands threatened in a joint letter to extend the summer of industrial action into the autumn. Unions locked in a long-running battle with the airline said they would hold \u201cthe biggest strike action the company has ever seen\u201d unless changes were made to their conditions. After a meeting in Rome, unions demanded that staff were given local contracts under local law rather than Irish contracts, which Ryanair uses across its European workforce. They said the strike would take place in the last week of September and that a decision on whether to go ahead would be made by 13 September. \u201cWe want to solve this. We don\u2019t want to strike,\u201d said Fernando Gandra, director at Portuguese union SNPVAC. He said the two Italian unions also had pilot members and that the unions would invite pilots and ground staff across Europe to join their cabin crew colleagues in the strike. Ryanair, which says its staff have better conditions than many low-cost rivals, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The airline confirmed earlier on Friday that it would reverse a decision made in July to move 20% of its Dublin-based fleet to Poland, due in part to the damage strike action was doing to bookings. \u201cThe board and management of Ryanair are committed to union recognition, and working constructively with our people and their unions to address their reasonable concerns, as long as this does not alter Ryanair\u2019s low-cost model or our ability to offer low fares to our customers,\u201d Ryanair\u2019s chief people officer Eddie Wilson said in a statement on the Dublin fleet plans. The airline said it had informed 300 pilots and cabin crew in Dublin that their jobs were now safe.",

      "bodyText": "The credit card details of 380,000 British Airways customers could already be on sale on the internet after the airline suffered a \u201cmalicious\u201d data breach, experts have warned. Customers were scrambling to change their credit card details on Friday, after BA said it was investigating the theft of passengers\u2019 financial data from its website and app over a two-week period between 21 August and 5 September. The airline said it would compensate passengers for any losses, signalling the potential for large payouts, given the number of customers affected. But cybersecurity experts said the customer information, including key security data such as the three-digit CVV code on the back of credit cards, might already have been traded on the dark web, a secretive layer of the internet frequently used by criminals. Paul Lipman, chief executive of cybersecurity company Bullguard, said customers\u2019 credit data was \u201calmost certainly up for sale on the dark web as we speak\u201d. One analyst said the stolen data would be worth more than \u00a320m, based on the going rate for credit card details on illicit websites. Lawyers said the company could also be hit with a class-action lawsuit from passengers if it was found to have failed to protect their personal data properly. The National Crime Agency, which is leading the investigation, said its officers were working with BA and that affected customers should now be on the lookout for a wave of \u201copportunistic\u201d follow-up scams by fraudsters seeking personal data from people affected by the data breach. The online theft saw details stolen including name, email address and credit card information, including the CVV code. BA has said that its encryption was not breached but that the hackers used other \u201cvery sophisticated\u201d methods. Cybersecurity experts speculated that the inclusion of CVV numbers meant that hackers had copied customers\u2019 data as they were typing it into the BA website, rather than stealing it from a database. Experts have pointed to the dark web as one possible destination for the data. The dark web is a term for corners of the internet, often accessible using certain software or encryption techniques, used by criminals for purposes such as clandestine drug sales or trading in personal data. Simon Migliano, head of research and cybersecurity expert at the online privacy website Top10VPN.com, said BA customers\u2019 data could be worth \u00a321.5m, based on an estimate of the average cost criminals are willing to pay for credit card details. \u201cThis serious security breach at BA could be sending the dark web into a frenzy,\u201d he said. \u201cFinancial information is extremely valuable and highly desirable and our Dark Web Market Price Index shows that credit card details can sell for \u00a356.50 each. BA could also face a class-action lawsuit from customers if it has failed to protect their data, according to the data privacy lawyer Nick McAleenan of JMW Solicitors. \u201cThe question of whether BA\u2019s system is up to scratch is the key issue,\u201d said McAleenan, who is representing employees of the supermarket chain Morrison\u2019s in a class action after they were subjected to a data breach. \u201cIf it can be demonstrated that they didn\u2019t have technical and organisational measures in place to prevent hackers getting access, you\u2019ve got the makings of a data protection claim.\u201d He said victims would not necessarily have to show financial loss but could claim based on the loss of their data alone, as well as the inconvenience and upset caused. The airline could also be fined hundreds of millions of pounds by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), which can impose penalties of up to 4% of turnover under new EU rules governing data protection. If the maximum were applied to BA, it could face a fine of \u00a3488m, but if the percentage were applied to the parent company, International Airlines Group, the amount could snowball to \u00a3825m. BA\u2019s chief executive, Alex Cruz, said customers would not be left out of pocket if the breach led to fraudulent transactions on their bank accounts. \u201cThe first thing to say is that I am extremely sorry for what happened,\u201d Cruz said on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \u201cWe will work with any customer affected and we will compensate any financial hardship suffered.\u201d Shares in BA\u2019s parent company IAG have fallen by 1.5% since it revealed the breach on Thursday night, wiping \u00a3120m off the stock market value of the company, as investors digested the potential impact on its finances and customer demand. Just a month after the new EU rules on data came into force \u2013 General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR \u2013 members of BA\u2019s frequent flyer programme received an email reassuring them about the security of their information. \u201cYour personal information is in safe hands with British Airways,\u201d the email read. \u201cWe want you to know you can trust us to respect your privacy and keep your personal information safe.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Kweku Adoboli considers himself \u201cvery British, but more a Yorkshireman\u201d. He has lived in the UK for the last 26 years, paid UK taxes and his favourite desert is apple crumble. But in the eyes of the law, Adoboli is not British, and his failure to get around to applying for citizenship has left him facing deportation to Ghana, his country of birth which he left as a four-year-old. He could be sent to Africa as soon as Monday, and is spending what could be his last few days in Britain in a notorious Scottish detention centre. Adoboli, 38, was found guilty in 2012 of being responsible, in the words of the judge, \u201cfor the largest trading loss in British banking history\u201d. The former UBS banker lost his Swiss bank $2.3bn (\u00a31.8bn) in \u201coff-book trades\u201d that brought the bank to its knees, leading to 10,000 job cuts and the axing of its chief executive. Adoboli was sentenced to seven years in jail, of which he served four. Under UK law, foreign nationals sentenced to more than four years in jail are automatically subject to deportation. From the canteen in the Dungavel immigration removal centre, near Strathaven, Adoboli is appealing to home secretary Sajid Javid and prime minister Theresa May to \u201cshow some compassion\u201d and intervene to prevent his \u201cbanishment\u201d. \u201cI did four years in prison for a non-violent act,\u201d he said in an interview with the Guardian from the detention centre. \u201cI\u2019ve served my time, but I\u2019m being given an extra punishment \u2013 a banishment \u2013 and just because I didn\u2019t get around to becoming a citizen. This punishment is so much worse than being in prison. \u201cPrison is a finite; you do your time, you hold your head high and you know you will get out. This [being deported] is really inhumane.\u201d Adoboli believes there are racist overtones to his treatment. \u201cPeople say it is OK for me to be sent back because it is where I am from,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I left when I was four. My life is here, my friends are here. If I were British my punishment would be over and I could get on with life.\u201d Not becoming a British citizen when he had the opportunity is, he said, the biggest oversight of his life. \u201cIronically, it was because I was trying to be good at my job that I didn\u2019t go through the citizenship steps,\u201d he said. \u201cI was the public face of UBS\u2019s Delta One desk running a \u00a350bn portfolio. At the drop of a hat I had to get on a plane to Frankfurt, New York or the Eurostar to Paris. I kept my passport in my desk drawer.\u201d Adoboli, who was earning \u00a3350,000 a year in his 30s, said he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do his job if he sent his passport to the Home Office as part of his citizenship application. \u201cI had indefinite leave to remain, which the bank said was basically the same as citizenship,\u201d he said. He has no fears about life in Ghana, but it\u2019s the prospect of never being able to return to the UK that gives him nightmares. \u201cI won\u2019t see my girlfriend, friends or seven godchildren again.\u201d Until he was detained by immigration officers this week, he was staying with the parents of two of his godchildren in Livingston. \u201cOne of them is five, the other is three, and they don\u2019t know where I am. They think I have gone down to London to earn some pennies, but they have figured out something is wrong. I normally tell them how many \u2018sleeps\u2019 I will be away for \u2013 but this time I didn\u2019t.\u201d The son of a Ghanaian UN peacekeeper, Adoboli\u2019s family left Ghana when he was four and he lived in Israel, Syria and Iraq. At 12 he was sent to a Quaker boarding school in West Yorkshire. \u201cMy friends at boarding school became my siblings, their parents became my surrogate family.\u201d From boarding school he went to Nottingham University where he studied computer science and management. \u201cI ended up in banking by mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cI needed to do an internship as part of my course, I wanted to do it at a tech firm but this was 2002 after the dotcom bubble had burst and no one was hiring, but the banks were.\u201d He rose quickly, and was sent around the world. Soon he was appointed to run the Delta One desk with colleague John Hughes. \u201cIt was a $50bn book being run by two kids,\u201d he said. Adoboli, who says he was working 20 hours a day and hating it, claimed he was preparing to quit in the weeks before the bank discovered his unauthorised trades. He admitted to the trades and set out the details in an email to his bosses, in which he took responsibility for \u201cthe shitstorm that will now ensue\u201d. He was arrested at 3.35 the next morning at his \u00a31,000-a-week flat near work.

He has lived in the UK for the last 26 years, paid UK taxes and his favourite desert is apple crumble.</p> <p>But in the eyes of the law, Adoboli is not British, and his failure to get around to applying for citizenship has left him facing deportation to Ghana, his country of birth which he left as a four-year-old. He could be sent to Africa as soon as Monday, and is spending what could be his last few days in Britain in a notorious Scottish detention centre.</p> <p>Adoboli, 38, was found guilty in 2012 of being responsible, in the words of the judge, \u201cfor the largest trading loss in British banking history\u201d. The former UBS banker lost his Swiss bank $2.3bn (\u00a31.8bn) in \u201coff-book trades\u201d that brought the bank to its knees, leading to 10,000 job cuts and the axing of its chief executive.</p> <p>Adoboli was sentenced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/nov/20/ubs-trader-kweku-adoboli-jailed-fraud\">seven years in jail</a>, of which he served four. Under UK law, foreign nationals sentenced to more than four years in jail are automatically subject to deportation.</p> <p>From the canteen in the Dungavel immigration removal centre, near Strathaven, Adoboli is appealing to home secretary Sajid Javid and prime minister Theresa May to \u201cshow some compassion\u201d and intervene to prevent his \u201cbanishment\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI did four years in prison for a non-violent act,\u201d he said in an interview with the Guardian from the detention centre. \u201cI\u2019ve served my time, but I\u2019m being given an extra punishment \u2013 a banishment \u2013 and just because I didn\u2019t get around to becoming a citizen. This punishment is so much worse than being in prison.</p> <p>\u201cPrison is a finite; you do your time, you hold your head high and you know you will get out. This [being deported] is really inhumane.\u201d </p> <p>Adoboli believes there are racist overtones to his treatment. \u201cPeople say it is OK for me to be sent back because it is where I am from,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I left when I was four. My life is here, my friends are here. If I were British my punishment would be over and I could get on with life.\u201d</p> <p>Not becoming a British citizen when he had the opportunity is, he said, the biggest oversight of his life. \u201cIronically, it was because I was trying to be good at my job that I didn\u2019t go through the citizenship steps,\u201d he said. \u201cI was the public face of UBS\u2019s Delta One desk running a \u00a350bn portfolio. At the drop of a hat I had to get on a plane to Frankfurt, New York or the Eurostar to Paris. I kept my passport in my desk drawer.\u201d</p> <p>Adoboli, who was earning \u00a3350,000 a year in his 30s, said he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do his job if he sent his passport to the Home Office as part of his citizenship application. \u201cI had indefinite leave to remain, which the bank said was basically the same as citizenship,\u201d he said. </p> <p>He has no fears about life in Ghana, but it\u2019s the prospect of never being able to return to the UK that gives him nightmares. \u201cI won\u2019t see my girlfriend, friends or seven godchildren again.\u201d</p> <p>Until he was detained by immigration officers this week, he was staying with the parents of two of his godchildren in Livingston. \u201cOne of them is five, the other is three, and they don\u2019t know where I am. They think I have gone down to London to earn some pennies, but they have figured out something is wrong. I normally tell them how many \u2018sleeps\u2019 I will be away for \u2013 but this time I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The son of a Ghanaian UN peacekeeper, Adoboli\u2019s family left Ghana when he was four and he lived in Israel, Syria and Iraq. At 12 he was sent to a Quaker boarding school in West Yorkshire. \u201cMy friends at boarding school became my siblings, their parents became my surrogate family.\u201d</p> <p>From boarding school he went to Nottingham University where he studied computer science and management. \u201cI ended up in banking by mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cI needed to do an internship as part of my course, I wanted to do it at a tech firm but this was 2002 after the dotcom bubble had burst and no one was hiring, but the banks were.\u201d</p> <p>He rose quickly, and was sent around the world. Soon he was appointed to run the Delta One desk with colleague John Hughes. \u201cIt was a $50bn book being run by two kids,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Adoboli, who says he was working 20 hours a day and hating it, claimed he was preparing to quit in the weeks before the bank discovered his unauthorised trades. He admitted to the trades and set out the details in an email to his bosses, in which he took responsibility for \u201cthe shitstorm that will now ensue\u201d. He was arrested at 3.35 the next morning at his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/20/kweku-adoboli-gilded-life-star-trader-ghana\">\u00a31,000-a-week flat near work</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He can understand that the public want to see bad bankers punished, but he said regular bankers like him were just trying to please their bosses and said the system needs to change. \u201cThat\u2019s what I have been trying to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI am volunteering, teaching ethics to finance kids and speaking about the need for responsible leadership and accountability.

    "webTitle": "How Great Western Railway shunted forward calls for an industry overhaul", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In a year when a major intercity franchise collapsed, passenger numbers dwindled and a timetable change threw commuter train services into turmoil, it is little wonder that a sense of crisis has pushed the government to consider a rail review. Outcry over ever-rising fares, Virgin\u2019s East Coast failure, then Thameslink and Northern chaos have all captured the headlines. Yet beyond all that, passengers have quietly suffered startling disruption, discomfort and delay in 2018 on a line that has undergone extraordinary investment and whose story poses further questions about how the railway is run, from procurement to franchising. By the time work is completed, almost \u00a310bn will have been poured into new track and trains for Great Western Railway, whose sprawling network runs from London to destinations such as Swansea, Penzance and Cheltenham Spa. GWR services are operated by the British bus and rail company FirstGroupwhile the maintenance and renewal of the infrastructure are overseen by government-owned Network Rail. This outlay on controversial new trains under a government-run process as well as poorly costed electrification work carried out by Network Rail have been the subject of scathing reports from the National Audit Office. Now, though, much of the route from London Paddington to Cardiff is electrified, with bottlenecks ironed out and the major interchange of Reading station rebuilt. Ten months ago, the first of the long-awaited new Intercity Express trains made by Japan\u2019s Hitachi entered service. Instead of heralding improvement, performance nosedived. Figures from the Office of Rail and Road, the industry regulator, show punctuality declined steadily from that moment, while delays reached unprecedented levels. Cancellations because of problems with trains or train crew rocketed to almost 800 a month in March, four times the average for the decade. Roughly one in six GWR trains were classified late, delayed by more than 10 minutes; at a lowpoint in May when barely one in four of GWR\u2019s long-distance services ran at the advertised time. Intense engineering work on the route has disrupted services and GWR achieved the rare feat, in March, of having more delays recorded as self-inflicted than caused by Network Rail. Meanwhile, passengers regularly found themselves crammed and standing on half-formed, five-carriage trains, with seat reservations rendered meaningless. The consumer group Which? found that accounts of \u201ctrain pain\u201d it has received featured a disproportionate number of GWR passengers: more than one in four of 1,000-plus complaints, although GWR carries less than 6% of all rail travellers in the UK. Common concerns were overcrowding, poor compensation, a lack of information and the harm disruption caused to passengers\u2019 personal and professional lives. Alex Hayman of Which? said: \u201cIt\u2019s simply wrong that they have to suffer from consistent delays and cancellations, can often only claim compensation if they have been delayed by an hour or more and even then have to put in the legwork themselves.\u201d Among the Which? testimonies was an account by Theo Knott, 25, from Bath, who said: \u201cIt gets exponentially worse \u2026 missing important family events and meetings, and the feeling of utter impotence when trying to get recompense, have made me angry at this company more than any other thing in everyday life.\u201d What went wrong? If teething problems on the Hitachi fleet were anticipated, the disastrous PR spectacle of a leaky, malfunctioning official launch train signalled worse. Software was rewritten to make seat-reservation systems function and address the coupling of five-carriage sets into long trains. The rush to complete over-budget electrification work by Network Rail left less time for GWR to train enough drivers (although it insists it has employed plenty). Rescheduled, repeated track closures threw GWR\u2019s logistics into disarray. The railway-wide May timetable change contributed additional stress. Some GWR staff appeared to have grown disaffected: one miserable Sunday the company said trains would not run as its drivers had opted to watch the World Cup rather than work overtime. One insider calls it a \u201cperfect storm\u201d. Christian Wolmar, a rail historian and former Labour by-election candidate, said: \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary how things have come home to roost. All this comes about because the railway isn\u2019t an entity but has been broken up into separate functions, when the management ought to be under one roof. The investment programme has made that worse because work is being carried out without regard to operational problems.\u201d In late August, the government decided against breaking up the GWR franchise but warned: \u201cRestoring punctuality and reliability performance to acceptable levels and then maintaining them will be a key priority.\u201d Despite those words, the Department for Transport has long let FirstGrouprun GWR without competition. Buried in the small print of the \u201cstrategic vision for railways\u201d issued last November by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, was the DfT\u2019s intent to extend First\u2019s contract from 2018 to 2022, with an option to extend to 2024. The DfT said the move \u201cwill allow the improved services to bed in fully before running a competition for a new long-term franchise\u201d. That could mean that First will have been given short-term extensions on GWR totalling 11 years, having exited its original contract after 2013 to avoid \u00a3800m in payments due to the Treasury. One industry figure, declining to be named, said: \u201cHow could you in all conscience give this contract to someone running this so badly, with all this investment?\u201d GWR said it will take until May 2019, when electrification should be completed and the timetable redrawn, for the benefits of the \u00a310bn investment to be fully evident. Services have improved in August and it believes it has turned a corner, with the Hitachi trains now outperforming the older HST trains in the fleet. A GWR spokesman said: \u201cWe welcome the department\u2019s desire to maintain continuity and stability for passengers as Network Rail continues its electrification programme. \u201cIn the meantime, we are concentrating on delivering the biggest package of improvements for customers across the network in a generation.\u201d Some suspect the direct contract award is an effort to keep First in the industry as one of the last British firms in rail. First\u2019s financial woes have long persisted, while the only franchises it has won this decade look like poisoned chalices: the loss-making TransPennine and South Western. Wolmar said: \u201cTo give people direct awards seems to negate anything the Tories said about competition \u2013 but it\u2019s an act of desperation. National Express are no longer in the game, Stagecoach have been booted off East Coast. Who\u2019s left? We need a new way of running the railways.\u201d A review of franchising in 2013 found the system was fundamentally sound. That conclusion looks increasingly hollow now, as Labour calls for renationalisation gain support and Grayling is pushed toward a new review. Senior industry figures believe a root-and-branch inquiry is necessary. David Brown, the chief executive of Go-Ahead, which runs transport services worldwide, including the troubled Thameslink, said: \u201cI\u2019d want a review to cover all aspects of the industry.You\u2019ve got to look at the way it\u2019s funded and regulated. Its about having common objectives. If you just look at franchising you won\u2019t end up with the right answer.\u201d On all sides is a belief that the operations of train and track should be more united to improve the railway. Passengers should hope the question of just how is answered soon. TROUBLE ON THE TRAINS Govia Thameslink Railway The busy commuter route, which runs from Brighton to Bedford via central London, has suffered years of strikes and delays. But this was eclipsed by the cancellation of thousands of trains after the timetable fiasco. An interim schedule since July has restored stability but there is still no date to bring in services promised in May. Northern Badly hit by the timetable chaos but has restored 75% of cancelled services as well as punctuality. Still affected by strikes.

Yet beyond all that, passengers have quietly suffered startling disruption, discomfort and delay in 2018 on a line that has undergone extraordinary investment and whose story poses further questions about how the railway is run, from procurement to franchising.</p> <p>By the time work is completed, almost \u00a310bn will have been poured into new track and trains for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/13/great-western-mainline-railway-upgrade-electrification-class-800-trains\">Great Western Railway</a>, whose sprawling network runs from London to destinations such as Swansea, Penzance and Cheltenham Spa. GWR services are operated by the British bus and rail company FirstGroupwhile the maintenance and renewal of the infrastructure are overseen by government-owned Network Rail. This outlay on controversial new trains under a government-run process as well as poorly costed electrification work carried out by Network Rail have been the subject of scathing reports from the National Audit Office.</p> <p>Now, though, much of the route from London Paddington to Cardiff is electrified, with bottlenecks ironed out and the major interchange of Reading station rebuilt. Ten months ago, the first of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/03/hitachi-factory-george-osborne-northern-powerhouse\">the long-awaited new Intercity Express</a> trains made by Japan\u2019s Hitachi entered service.</p> <p>Instead of heralding improvement, performance nosedived. Figures from the Office of Rail and Road, the industry regulator, show punctuality declined steadily from that moment, while delays reached unprecedented levels. Cancellations because of problems with trains or train crew rocketed to almost 800 a month in March, four times the average for the decade. Roughly one in six GWR trains were classified late, delayed by more than 10 minutes; at a lowpoint in May when barely one in four of GWR\u2019s long-distance services ran at the advertised time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/gwr_map-zip/giv-3902PU0IXNfnlkZH\" data-alt=\"GWR spending\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/08/gwr_map-zip/giv-3902PU0IXNfnlkZH\">GWR spending</a> </figure>  <p>Intense engineering work on the route has disrupted services and GWR achieved the rare feat, in March, of having more delays recorded as self-inflicted than caused by Network Rail. Meanwhile, passengers regularly found themselves crammed and standing on half-formed, five-carriage trains, with seat reservations rendered meaningless.</p> <p>The consumer group Which? found that accounts of <a href=\"https://campaigns.which.co.uk/train-hell-rail-passengers/\">\u201ctrain pain\u201d</a> it has received featured a disproportionate number of GWR passengers: more than one in four of 1,000-plus complaints, although GWR carries less than 6% of all rail travellers in the UK. Common concerns were overcrowding, poor compensation, a lack of information and the harm disruption caused to passengers\u2019 personal and professional lives. Alex Hayman of Which? said: \u201cIt\u2019s simply wrong that they have to suffer from consistent delays and cancellations, can often only claim compensation if they have been delayed by an hour or more and even then have to put in the legwork themselves.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s extraordinary how things have come home to roost</p> <footer> <cite>Christian Wolmar</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Among the Which? testimonies was an account by Theo Knott, 25, from Bath, who said: \u201cIt gets exponentially worse \u2026 missing important family events and meetings, and the feeling of utter impotence when trying to get recompense, have made me angry at this company more than any other thing in everyday life.\u201d</p> <p>What went wrong? If teething problems on the Hitachi fleet were anticipated, the disastrous PR spectacle of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/16/delays-and-drips-mark-great-western-railways-new-train-launch\">leaky, malfunctioning official launch train</a> signalled worse. Software was rewritten to make seat-reservation systems function and address the coupling of five-carriage sets into long trains.</p> <p>The rush to complete <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/21/cost-to-electrify-great-western-mainline-triples-to-28bn-risking-other-schemes\">over-budget electrification work</a> by Network Rail left less time for GWR to train enough drivers (although it insists it has employed plenty). Rescheduled, repeated track closures threw GWR\u2019s logistics into disarray. The railway-wide May timetable change contributed additional stress. Some GWR staff appeared to have grown disaffected: one miserable Sunday the company said trains would not run as its drivers had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-44845472\">opted to watch the World Cup</a> rather than work overtime. One insider calls it a \u201cperfect storm\u201d.</p> <p>Christian Wolmar, a rail historian and former Labour by-election candidate, said: \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary how things have come home to roost. All this comes about because the railway isn\u2019t an entity but has been broken up into separate functions, when the management ought to be under one roof. The investment programme has made that worse because work is being carried out without regard to operational problems.\u201d</p> <p>In late August, the government <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/736146/great-western-rail-franchise-stakeholder-briefing-document.pdf\">decided against breaking up the GWR franchise</a> but warned: \u201cRestoring punctuality and reliability performance to acceptable levels and then maintaining them will be a key priority.\u201d</p> <p>Despite those words, the Department for Transport has long let FirstGrouprun GWR without competition. Buried in the small print of the \u201cstrategic vision for railways\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/29/east-coast-rail-franchise-terminated-three-years-early-virgin-trains\">issued last November</a> by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, was the DfT\u2019s intent to extend First\u2019s contract from 2018 to 2022, with an option to extend to 2024. The DfT said the move \u201cwill allow the improved services to bed in fully before running a competition for a new long-term franchise\u201d.</p> <p>That could mean that First will have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/23/first-group-great-western-trains-four-more-years\">given short-term extensions</a> on GWR totalling 11 years, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/03/first-group-great-western-franchise-32m-pounds\">exited its original contract</a> after 2013 to avoid \u00a3800m in payments due to the Treasury. One industry figure, declining to be named, said: \u201cHow could you in all conscience give this contract to someone running this so badly, with all this investment?\u201d</p> <p>GWR said it will take until May 2019, when electrification should be completed and the timetable redrawn, for the benefits of the \u00a310bn investment to be fully evident. Services have improved in August and it believes it has turned a corner, with the Hitachi trains now outperforming the older HST trains in the fleet.</p> <p>A GWR spokesman said: \u201cWe welcome the department\u2019s desire to maintain continuity and stability for passengers as Network Rail continues its electrification programme.</p> <p>\u201cIn the meantime, we are concentrating on delivering the biggest package of improvements for customers across the network in a generation.\u201d</p> <p>Some suspect the direct contract award is an effort to keep First in the industry as one of the last British firms in rail. First\u2019s financial woes have long persisted, while the only franchises it has won this decade look like poisoned chalices: the loss-making TransPennine and South Western. </p> <p>Wolmar said: \u201cTo give people direct awards seems to negate anything the Tories said about competition \u2013 but it\u2019s an act of desperation. National Express are no longer in the game, Stagecoach have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/16/east-coast-rail-line-to-be-temporarily-renationalised-virgin-stagecoach\">booted off East Coas</a>t. Who\u2019s left? We need a new way of running the railways.\u201d</p> <p>A review of franchising in 2013 found the system was fundamentally sound. That conclusion looks increasingly hollow now, as Labour calls for renationalisation gain support and Grayling is pushed toward a new review.</p> <p>Senior industry figures believe a root-and-branch inquiry is necessary. David Brown, the chief executive of Go-Ahead, which runs transport services worldwide, including the troubled Thameslink, said: \u201cI\u2019d want a review to cover all aspects of the industry.You\u2019ve got to look at the way it\u2019s funded and regulated. Its about having common objectives. If you just look at franchising you won\u2019t end up with the right answer.\u201d</p> <p>On all sides is a belief that the operations of train and track should be more united to improve the railway. Passengers should hope the question of just how is answered soon.</p> <h2>TROUBLE ON THE TRAINS<br></h2> <p><strong>Govia Thameslink Railway</strong><br>The busy commuter route, which runs from Brighton to Bedford via<br>central London, has suffered years of strikes and delays.

Answers on exactly how the criminals were able to steal the credit card information are thin on the ground and will likely require BA or a third-party security contractor to divulge details. Data breaches can take many forms, from simply leaving sensitive security data on USB flash drives on west London streets, to blackmail, social engineering, disgruntled ex- or current employees and intrusion attempts exploiting one or multiple weaknesses in a company\u2019s cybersecurity. However, statements so far point to point to a different scenario to that experienced by Dixons Carphone earlier this year. BA says only personal and financial data was taken, and only from those purchasing flights between 21 August and 5 September when the hack was active, not those with credit cards saved on their accounts. Where Dixons Carphone had historic data on 10 million customers stolen by cybercriminals gaining access to databases, this new \u201cvery sophisticated\u201d hack \u2013 in the words of BA\u2019s CEO \u2013 appears to have only taken data as it was entered into the system during the purchasing process. \u201cOne possibility is that hackers compromised a flaw in the software on British Airways\u2019 website,\u201d Richard Walters, the chief technology officer of the security firm CensorNet, said. \u201cIt is speculation until further details emerge but an attacker could then upload information stealing code to the website, which could intercept messages with backend systems, including financial data. \u201cIf this is the case, a copy of data would be sent to the criminals as it was relayed to the company\u2019s main IT infrastructure. This kind of attack could also have affected the app if they use common systems.\u201d The National Crime Agency said it is investigating the breach. A spokesman for the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office said it would also be making inquiries about the data theft. \u201cPerhaps most significantly, this is one of the first major breaches since GDPR came into effect in May,\u201d Walters said. \u201cIt appears that the company notified the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office and customers within the GDPR\u2019s mandatory 72 hours but the breach will now be investigated and the company could be penalised if it failed to take all the necessary measures to protect customer data.\u201d Full details on precisely how this attack happened, and any possible punitive actions including fines for BA, may only be revealed months down the line. In the meantime, experts say the consequences for those affected by the theft are likely to roll out over time. \u201cOnce hackers have hold of high-value data like card details, the market in criminal networks for reselling is huge, meaning that we may not see the effects of this theft immediately until a buyer acts,\u201d Leigh Anne Galloway, the cyber security resilience lead at Positive Technologies, said. \u201cThe best thing to do for anyone who thinks their details may have been involved, or who has been told so by BA, should keep an eye on their transactions.

      "bodyText": "On 1 September 1958, Iceland extended its fishing limit from four to 12 nautical miles from the coast. British vessels ignored the official deadline for withdrawal and refused to move outside of the new fishing zone, leading to confrontations with Icelandic crews. Boats were rammed, shots fired and Royal Navy warships were deployed to protect the British trawlers. This became known as the first cod war - a phrase coined by Fleet Street in September 1958 - with disputes continuing as Iceland extended its zone to 50 miles in 1973 and in 1976 a 200-mile limit.Each phase saw an increasing number of ramming and net-cutting incidents. Guardian reports from 1958 describe the first confrontations between rival fishermen in the unforgiving seas around Iceland. Navy hopes for early friendly finish From our special correspondent On board HMS Hound, 1 September 1958 The Navy, it can now be officially revealed, is here. Early to-day four ships of the Fishery Protection Squadron were standing by in Icelandic waters to prevent any interference with British trawlers fishing within the twelve-mile limit. Iceland\u2019s unilateral extension of her territorial waters to twelve miles came into force at midnight. The ships are HMS Eastbourne, HMS Russell, and HMS Palliser (all frigates), and HMS Hound, an ocean minesweeper. They had sailed from various British ports during the last week, and until midnight their movements were under a strict security blackout to avoid any appearance of gunboat diplomacy while there was still -a chance that the dispute could be settled by negotiation. T Iceland\u2019s navy Ranged against the British ships if there is any-trouble will be the tiny Icelandic navy. It consists of eight small coastguard patrol vessels, three of them. under 100 tons, and the largest of them, the Thor, only 693 tons. According to Icelandic sources, they intend to fire into the bridge of any trawler inside the twelve-mile limit which-fails to stop after a shot across the bows. Skipper back from Iceland tells his story: uncollected bet with boarding party 10 September 1958 The British warships are now dispersed around the one thousand tricky miles of Iceland\u2019s coastline. They will patrol three areas within the, twelve-mile limit off the south-east and north-west coasts. Some forty British trawlers are reported to be in Icelandic coastal waters already, with another fifty on their way. \u2018They are required by their owners to spend at least the first three days fishing in the protected areas. After that they may, if they choose, fish outside the twelve-mile limit but any trawler skipper, caught operating inside the limit and outside the protected area will be liable to severe punishment. Skipper Jim Crockwell, of the trawler Northern Foam, arrived at Grimsby yesterday and told this story of how, a week ago, the trawler had been boarded by a party from the Icelandic frigate Thor. \u201cWe were fishing in the protected area known as Spearmint II,\u201d he said, \u201cand we were in dense fog. Visibility was nil. I could see there were two ships approaching on the radar screen, and I supposed that they were other ships fishing in the area. They were going about the same speed as we were, but in the opposite direction. Suddenly Thor appeared out of the fog on our port side and Maria-Julia came up on our starboard side. The Thor positioned herself on our port bow. To have kept on going would have meant colliding with the Maria-Julia and we would have sunk her, because she is only a wooden ship. To avoid any damage we hauled our gear and while we were doing that the boarding party came on board. The officer in charge of the boarding party came on to the bridge and said, \u2018Skipper, I advise you to go on board the gunboat.\u2019 I told him I was not going anywhere. Another officer came on to the bridge and said to me, Skipper, have you got secret paper? \u2018 I said \u2018Yes.\u2019 He held out his hand and said, \u2018I want them.\u2019 I said, \u2018Go jump in the ocean and get lost.\u2019 Swopped yarns In the meantime my wireless operator, Ted Armstrong, locked himself in his wireless cabin and after making sure that no one could get into him he called HMS.Hound and told them what was happening. The Hound contacted HMS Eastbourne and Eastbourne sent me a signal saying, We are steaming to you at 25 knots? We never moved and the Icelandic boarding party were very nice. In fact, we swopped a yarn or two with them. Then the fog cleared a little. When the Icelanders saw the Eastbourne appearing out of the fog one of the officers rang the telegraph to \u2018full speed ahead\u2019 and he turned to me and said, \u2018Skipper. we are going to ram this ship\u2019 \u2013 meaning the Eastbourne. Two men took over the wheel and another took over the telegraph. When I tried to contact the engine room they held their hands over the voicepipe, and another one stepped into the chart room door so that I could not speak to the wireless operator. The mate was on the bridge at the time. so I whispered to him, \u2018Go and tell the chief to stop the bloody engines and not to move at all.\u2019 So he did. I said to the officer in chargeAre we going somewhere?\u2019 and if looks could have killed I would have dropped dead. That officer, by the way, was wearing dungarees and a stocking cap. Within about ten minutes tale boarding party from Eastbourne came aboard, and as soon as the first Icelandic officer saw them coming he turned to me and said, \u2018Hitler is coming.\u2019 He bet me a dollar that they would take my ship into Iceland. and now I think of it I forgot to ask him for the dollar as he was put aboard Eastbourne. He also said, if it takes ten years we will get you\u2019 = The boarding party from the Navy was on board by that time and they refused to leave without orders from their captain. Commodore Anderson (of the Eastbourne) went on board the Thor and when he returned again the skipper of the gunboat refused to take his crew on board. So they were removed by the Navy. There was no force used. They stood like mules and would not shift because I don\u2019t think they wanted to go.\u201d Skipper Crockwell, a Newfoundlander, came to Britain during the war and served in the Navy. After two or three days on the slipway Skipper Crockwell will take Northern Foam back to Icelandic waters. He said: \u201c We arc still going back and I shall fish within the twelve-miles limit under the watchful eye of the British Navy. I hope every other skipper will do the same, and let them see who is boss.\u201d Eventually the dispute was settled through diplomatic means with NATO-mediated sessions leading to Iceland and the UK reaching an agreement on 1 June 1976. The British were allowed to keep 24 trawlers within the 200 mile zone as long as their catch was limited to 50,000 tons. However, Iceland had achieved its overall aims. The already-declining British fisheries were hit hard by being excluded from their prime fishing grounds and large northern fishing ports such as Grimsby, Hull, and Fleetwood saw thousands of deep-sea fishermen and people in related trades losing their jobs. A compensation package for loss of livelihoods was finally agreed in 2001.",

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s be generous to the Ofgem chief, Dermot Nolan. He\u2019s produced a respectable fudge, as he was told to. Parliament gave him the tricky job of setting an energy price cap at a level that prevents \u201crip-off\u201d pricing but still encourages customers to switch suppliers, goals that pull in opposite directions. A figure of \u00a31,136 \u2013 being the proposed upper limit for a standard variable tariff for a typical dual-fuel customer \u2013 looks as good a stab as any. It\u2019s slightly embarrassing that the average saving of \u00a375 for punters on default deals is lower than the \u00a3100 that Theresa May had unwisely trumpeted. But wholesale energy prices move all the time, so the more relevant figure is the overall savings to consumers, which Ofgem put at \u00a31bn, or slightly more than the big six made in profits last year. Think of the price cap, then, as a command to companies to shed costs, meaning jobs. The obvious danger is that suppliers also whack up the prices of their fixed-price tariffs for active switchers. If all prices end up clustering around the Ofgem-mandated maximum, even the current feeble state of competition will evaporate. The test will be levels of switching. Last year 17% of customers moved. If the rate plunges from that level, this supposedly temporary exercise will be a flop in its own terms. Will it even be temporary? The official script says the price cap will stay until 2023 at the latest while Ofgem develops policies \u201cto make the energy market more competitive and work better for all consumers\u201d. Since Nolan\u2019s predecessors comprehensively failed on that score, it\u2019s asking a lot to believe a magical formula will now appear. Note that neither Ofgem nor the government has defined the criteria for lifting the cap, which is an enormous oversight. One suspects price caps could last longer than advertised at the outset. If so, some will applaud since it\u2019s definitely true that the big six invited intervention by gouging their inattentive customers. But it is also entirely unproven that price caps will act as the intended sharp shock that \u201cresets\u201d the market. They may just produce a different sort of muddle that satisfies nobody \u2013 certainly not customers who followed the sound advice to pay attention and shop around. Melrose in a hole over GKN spend \u201cNo black holes found,\u201d reported Melrose after five months of owning GKN. The Melrose gang generated huge controversy with their \u00a38bn hostile takeover of the former FTSE 100 automotive and aerospace group but they tend not to miss details. If there were a black hole to find, they would have spotted it by now. The shares rose 3% even though it will be at least 18 months before one can judge Melrose\u2019s performance on the biggest (by far) turnaround it has attempted. There is, though, a hole that we already knew about: the costs of doing the deal. Transaction costs totalled \u00a3126m in Thursday\u2019s half-year figures, of which only \u00a354m related to charges on bank borrowings. The bulk of the rest comprised fees to assorted lawyers, accountants and City advisers. In mitigation, one could say there was a large success-related element, a plea that was not available to the GKN side, where \u00a3107m was clocked up during an unsuccessful defence. The money-pot for advisers isn\u2019t fresh news, but the figures remain astonishing. Help to buy \u2013 a boon for chief executives One extension to help to buy, introduced by George Osborne in 2013, is not enough for the housebuilders. They\u2019re already lobbying for another, to take the scheme beyond 2021. This is entirely unsurprising given that subsidies for house-buyers have had a wondrous effect of builders\u2019 profit margins. But at least Greg Fitzgerald, the boss of Bovis Homes, realises the game changed when the Persimmon chief, Jeff Fairburn, got a \u00a375m bonus from an incentive scheme pumped up by help to buy. Any extension, says Fitzgerald, is bound to come with rules \u201cto stop you bastard chief executives earning all this money from government subsidies\u201d, as he puts it. Let\u2019s hope so. After the Persimmon fiasco, anything else would be a disgrace.",

But wholesale energy prices move all the time, so the more relevant figure is the overall savings to consumers, which Ofgem put at \u00a31bn, or slightly more than the big six made in profits last year. Think of the price cap, then, as a command to companies to shed costs, meaning jobs.</p> <p>The obvious danger is that suppliers also whack up the prices of their fixed-price tariffs for active switchers. If all prices end up clustering around the Ofgem-mandated maximum, even the current feeble state of competition will evaporate. The test will be levels of switching. Last year 17% of customers moved. If the rate plunges from that level, this supposedly temporary exercise will be a flop in its own terms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"46637d120766608c1cc2b721445d794af3039597\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46637d120766608c1cc2b721445d794af3039597/0_80_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dermot Nolan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dermot Nolan has produced a \u2018respectable fudge\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ofgem</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Will it even be temporary? The official script says the price cap will stay until 2023 at the latest while Ofgem develops policies \u201cto make the energy market more competitive and work better for all consumers\u201d. Since Nolan\u2019s predecessors comprehensively failed on that score, it\u2019s asking a lot to believe a magical formula will now appear. Note that neither Ofgem nor the government has defined the criteria for lifting the cap, which is an enormous oversight. One suspects price caps could last longer than advertised at the outset.</p> <p>If so, some will applaud since it\u2019s definitely true that the big six invited intervention by gouging their inattentive customers. But it is also entirely unproven that price caps will act as the intended sharp shock that \u201cresets\u201d the market. They may just produce a different sort of muddle that satisfies nobody \u2013 certainly not customers who followed the sound advice to pay attention and shop around.</p> <h2><strong>Melrose in a hole over GKN spend</strong></h2> <p>\u201cNo black holes found,\u201d reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/melrose\">Melrose</a> after five months of owning GKN. The Melrose gang generated huge controversy with their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/29/melrose-was-ready-for-action-hostile-takeover-target-gkn-wasnt\">\u00a38bn hostile takeover</a> of the former FTSE 100 automotive and aerospace group but they tend not to miss details. If there were a black hole to find, they would have spotted it by now. The shares rose 3% even though it will be at least 18 months before one can judge Melrose\u2019s performance on the biggest (by far) turnaround it has attempted.</p> <p>There is, though, a hole that we already knew about: the costs of doing the deal. Transaction costs totalled \u00a3126m in Thursday\u2019s half-year figures, of which only \u00a354m related to charges on bank borrowings. The bulk of the rest comprised fees to assorted lawyers, accountants and City advisers. In mitigation, one could say there was a large success-related element, a plea that was not available to the GKN side, where \u00a3107m was clocked up during an unsuccessful defence. The money-pot for advisers isn\u2019t fresh news, but the figures remain astonishing.</p> <h2>Help to buy \u2013 a boon for chief executives</h2> <p>One extension to help to buy, introduced by George Osborne in 2013, is not enough for the housebuilders. They\u2019re already lobbying for another, to take the scheme beyond 2021. This is entirely unsurprising given that subsidies for house-buyers have had a wondrous effect of builders\u2019 profit margins.</p> <p>But at least Greg Fitzgerald, the boss of Bovis Homes, realises the game changed when the Persimmon chief, Jeff Fairburn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/25/persimmon-investors-revolt-bonus-pay-vote\">got a \u00a375m bonus</a> from an incentive scheme pumped up by help to buy. Any extension, says Fitzgerald, is bound to come with rules \u201cto stop you bastard chief executives earning all this money from government subsidies\u201d, as he puts it. Let\u2019s hope so. After the Persimmon fiasco, anything else would be a disgrace.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Waterstones is buying the historic family-owned book chain Foyles in a surprise deal billed as an antidote to the \u201csiren call\u201d of online rival Amazon. The sale brings down the curtain on the independence of one of Britain\u2019s best known bookselling dynasties, with Foyles most famous for its Charing Cross Road branch in London. James Daunt, the managing director of Waterstones, made a pointed reference to the competitive threat posed by Amazon, which is being blamed for killing off the high street book trade. He said: \u201cTogether we will be stronger and better positioned to protect and champion the pleasures of real bookshops in the face of Amazon\u2019s siren call.\u201d With 283 shops Waterstones, which also owns Hatchards, is Britain\u2019s biggest book chain with \u00a3404m in annual sales. Foyles operates seven branches, with four in London and the remainder in Birmingham, Chelmsford and Bristol. The value of the deal has not been disclosed but Daunt said he had been approached by Foyles to acquire the company. Foyles is controlled by its Monaco-based chairman, Christopher Foyle, who is the grandson of one of the founders. \u201cMy family and I are delighted that Foyles is entering a new chapter, one which secures the brand\u2019s future and protects its personality,\u201d Foyle said. \u201cI look forward to witnessing the exciting times ahead for the company founded by my grandfather and his brother 115 years ago.\u201d In recent years Foyles has been run by hired hands and, with no heir apparent, in 2014 Christopher Foyle told the Guardian \u201cone day I will make a decision; unless I die in the saddle\u201d. He owns 65% of the company with the rest shared between other family members and management. Foyles traces its roots back to the turn of the last century when William and Gilbert Foyle, aged 17 and 18, launched a bookselling business from their kitchen table after failing their civil service exams. The first iteration of the Charing Cross Road store opened nearly a decade later. William\u2019s daughter Christina joined the family firm in the 1920s and she helped put it at the heart of the literary world, hosting the Foyles literary luncheons, which were attended by famous authors and prime ministers. She handed over the reins to her nephew Christopher six days before she died in 1999. During its long history Foyles has weathered financial highs and lows. It made a small loss in the year to 30 June 2017 after the number of shoppers visiting its stores declined in the wake of the terrorist attacks in London and Manchester. The deal has been brokered at an opportune time as in the coming years the business, with annual sales of \u00a326.6m, would have to keep up with hefty rental payments on the famous Charing Cross Road store which the family sold to property investors for \u00a345m earlier this year. In a statement the Foyle family added: \u201cJames Daunt has assured us of his desire to maintain and celebrate the Foyles name and our distinct bookselling identity. Whilst the decision to sell has been a hard one, we are confident that Waterstones will nurture and protect Foyles for the good of the business, its staff and its customers.\u201d The rise of Amazon has had a dramatic impact on the high street book trade, with the number of independent book shops halving to 858 since the US retailer\u2019s UK launch two decades ago. This week the Booksellers Association warned MPs looking at the future of the high street that \u201cbookshops have closed because of Amazon\u201d. Waterstones has been a key player in industry consolidation in recent years. As book sales transfer online, Waterstones has bought up struggling smaller rivals Dillons, Ottakar\u2019s and Books Etc. It was recently sold to the hedge fund Elliott Advisors, the UK division of the $34bn (\u00a325bn) activist hedge fund Elliott Management, run by controversial New Yorker Paul Singer. Daunt promised the deal would not spell the end of Foyles as we know it and pointed to its careful custodianship of other brands such as Hatchards and Hodges Figgis. \u201cWaterstones has the ability to carry a very distinctive bookselling brand within the business,\u201d he said. \u201cFoyles has a huge stature and I respect and believe in that.\u201d Daunt said the Foyles deal created a stronger business to stand up to the might Amazon: \u201cIt is definitely getting worse for the [book] industry as a whole as Amazon is continuing to grow sales and market share. As a retailer it\u2019s not making money and will happily subsidise its overall relationship with customers by cutting the price of books so people will join Prime and buy a blinking Alexa, shoelaces and all the rest.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of British Airways has promised to compensate customers who have had their data stolen in what he described as a sophisticated breach of the company\u2019s security systems. \u00c1lex Cruz apologised on Friday after it was revealed that about 380,000 payment cards had been compromised after a theft of data from the BA website and app over a two-week period. \u201cThe first thing to say is that I am extremely sorry for what happened,\u201d Cruz said on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \u201cWe will work with any customer affected and we will compensate any financial hardship suffered.\u201d Shares in the owner of BA, IAG, fell nearly 3% on Friday morning as investors weighed the impact of the hack on ticket sales. The breach took place between 10.58pm BST on 21 August and 9.45pm on 5 September. The airline said personal and financial details of customers making bookings had been compromised. Cruz said the attack had not been a breach of encryption but it was a \u201csophisticated\u201d effort by criminals. He said he would not go into much detail about the nature of what happened because the police were investigating. The data theft, one of the most serious to hit a UK company, deals another blow to BA\u2019s reputation. The airline experienced an IT disaster last year when a power surge in its control centre near Heathrow caused a global flight interruption and left tens of thousands of passengers stranded, most notably at London airports. Cruz said the company was operating profitably and would expand its services and customer care. \u201cWe will get through this.\u201d He said BA had a network of partners that monitored websites around the world. A partner alerted the airline to the cyber-attack on 5 September and an investigation was launched. \u201cThe moment that actual customer data had been compromised, that\u2019s when we began immediate communication to our customers,\u201d Cruz said. The airline placed advertisements in newspapers on Friday apologising for the breach. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is investigating the breach and the airline could potentially be fined.",

What data was compromised? The airline says personal and financial details of customers making bookings over the period were compromised. No passport or travel details were stolen. How did the hack happen? British Airways says it was not a breach of the airline\u2019s encryption. \u201cThere were other methods, very sophisticated efforts, by criminals in obtaining our data,\u201d BA\u2019s chief executive, \u00c1lex Cruz, said. Some experts have speculated that the hackers carried out a digital version of card \u201cskimming\u201d by copying data as it was entered into the system during the purchasing process. I made a booking then, what should I do? BA said it was in the process of contacting all affected customers. The airline is advising those customers to contact their bank or card provider and follow their advice. Will I be compensated? BA says that any customers who lose out financially will be compensated. Will I have to get a new card? Some customers have complained of having to cancel cards as a result of the breach. The airline said affected customers should follow their bank or provider's recommended advice. Should I change my password? Alex Neill of the consumer group Which? said anyone concerned they could be at risk of fraud should consider changing their online passwords and monitor their bank and other online accounts. She also urged people to be wary of emails regarding the breach because scammers may try to take advantage of it. I'm a BA customer but I did not book a ticket over the affected period The airline said the incident has been resolved and all systems are working normally. Customers due to travel can check in online as normal. How about future bookings? Future bookings will not be affected, BA said.",
