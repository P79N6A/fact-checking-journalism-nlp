      "bodyText": "Less than two months ago, the finance ministers of the G20 gathered for a celebratory dinner in Peru to mark agreement on a \u201conce-in-a-century\u201d package of reforms to combat tax avoidance by multinational corporations that is costing governments up to $240bn a year. But last week a Scottish accountant unveiled a record-breaking $160bn transaction that laid bare quite how much work remains to be done. Ian Read, chief executive of American drug maker Pfizer, has agreed plans for a so-called \u201ctax inversion\u201d: a takeover deal that involves joining forces with a smaller, foreign rival and assuming its overseas headquarters for tax purposes. The deal is expected to create the world\u2019s biggest pharmaceuticals company, with pills and treatments ranging from Botox and Viagra to specialist statins and generic drugs. But the agreed deal will also become largest-ever tax inversion, and as such has thrown an unflattering spotlight on the US tax code, highlighting long-standing weaknesses. On the face of it, the US has one of the most onerous corporate tax regimes: its headline rate of 35% is among the highest in the world, and the authorities have taxing rights over profits made far beyond US borders. In practice, however, the system is riddled with loopholes that mean many American multinationals are achieving some of the lowest effective tax rates on record. While this is attractive for corporations, there is a catch. To achieve a low tax rate they must keep much of their profits overseas, and that has led to a huge buildup of offshore cash. Many of America\u2019s biggest businesses now think they can release these funds without triggering a US tax bill by moving their headquarters outside the US. Read\u2019s target is Allergan, itself the product of a rapid succession of tax-driven mergers. At first sight, it appears to be just as American a company as Pfizer: it is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has its administrative head office in Parsippany, New Jersey \u2013 just 30 miles from Pfizer\u2019s Manhattan HQ \u2013and makes 84% of its sales in the US. For tax purposes, however, Allergan has an advantage: it is able to tell the US authorities it is an Irish multinational. This is because its main executive office suite is in a building on Grand Canal Square, Dublin \u2013 an address that has been repeatedly used by US multinationals in aggressive tax planning. It is this structure that Pfizer hopes to replicate through a combination with Allergan. Some critics of Read\u2019s plan have been quick to point to the gap between US and Irish headline tax rates \u2013 35% and 12.5% respectively \u2013 and suggest Pfizer is preparing to use a new Irish base to strip out earnings from its US operations, booking them in low-tax Dublin. But Pfizer has already structured its affairs so as not to pay tax in the US: it has recorded losses in America every year since 2007. In fact, Pfizer has been one of America\u2019s most proficient tax-planning multinationals for years, parking $74bn of untaxed profits outside the US. That sum is equivalent to more than 35% of Pfizer\u2019s stock market value. Under American tax rules, these overseas profits are taxable by the US \u2013 but, crucially, the liability can be deferred so long as the earnings are not brought back to the country. This deferral has been exploited on a huge scale by Pfizer and American multinationals such as Apple, Google, General Motors and Merck. In total, US multinationals are sitting on an estimated $2.1tn in untaxed offshore profits, a third of which is accounted for by just 10 groups \u2013 among them Pfizer. The drug group\u2019s chief financial officer, Frank D\u2019Amelio, spelt out the real tax prize for Pfizer on a call with a Wall Street analyst last week. \u201cThis [Allergan deal] significantly increases our access to global cash,\u201d he said. Unlike their US counterparts, Irish tax authorities claim no taxing rights over earnings made by an Irish multinational through its overseas subsidiaries. With $26bn of Pfizer cash parked offshore, it is clear Read is determined to unlock this treasure chest while triggering as little tax liability as he can. Read\u2019s plans, however, have brought swift condemnation from politicians. \u201cFor too long, powerful corporations have exploited loopholes that allow them to hide earnings abroad to lower their taxes,\u201d said Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \u201cNow Pfizer is trying to reduce its tax bill even further.\u201d For Republican Donald Trump, the deal was simply \u201cdisgusting\u201d. Read professes to be baffled by these remarks. \u201cI cannot comprehend why [the deal] is not being applauded by the political class, or why anyone would want to frustrate this transaction,\u201d he told the Financial Times. The political sniping about Pfizer provides the backdrop for another battle over tax issues on Capitol Hill next week. Many influential Republicans, already uncomfortable about the Peru reforms, are expected to use committee hearings to launch an attack on the European commission\u2019s ongoing state aid investigations into suspected sweetheart tax deals granted by Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to, respectively, Apple, Starbucks and Amazon. Well-resourced rightwing lobbyists are agitating in Washington for a final push against the G20 tax reforms. Led by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), they particularly want to block so-called country-by-country reporting (CBCR). Under CBCR, basic business data, broken down by geography, will be submitted privately to tax authorities around the world. It will provide tax offices with valuable anti-avoidance intelligence, and is heralded as the most significant single measure to come out of the reform programme. But the NAM says CBCR will force US groups to divulge \u201csensitive, proprietary business information\u201d to foreign powers, and should be stopped or watered down. Several influential Republicans, including Orrin Hatch, chair of the Senate finance committee, and Charles Boustany, chair of the ways and means committee \u2013 have rallied to their cause. Hatch and Boustany have announced separate hearings into the G20-agreed reforms. \u201cThe recommendations contained in the [reform package] raise a number of serious concerns about taxpayer confidentiality, said Hatch. \u201cAt the same time, the EU has launched investigations into American multinationals ... I expect a robust discussion at this hearing on what the [G20] project means for US taxpayers ... as well as how the EU state aid investigations could potentially affect tax revenues paid to the US Treasury.\u201d Pascal Saint-Amans, head of the OECD unit that led the G20 reforms, played down suggestions that political pressure could derail them. \u201cWe could ask: is Congress preparing to stop the CBCR? Or is it just looking to make sure the Obama administration isn\u2019t exceeding its executive powers? I think the answer is this is not a big moment. It\u2019s largely about an internal US debate.\u201d Stephen Shay, a senior lecturer at Harvard law school who has held major tax roles in the Treasury, also believes Congress will not stand in the way of CBCR. \u201cThere is going to be a lot of Sturm und Drang, \u2018this is terrible\u2019, and \u2018they\u2019re targeting American multinationals\u2019 from the committees ... But it\u2019s too late. I think what the politicians are going to be told by the responsible businesses is that the bus has left the station.\u201d But amid the handshaking and back-slapping over the reform package in Peru last month, the words of German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble still resonate. \u201cThat is not the end of the story,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is no implementation, it remains an impressive amount of paper.\u201d BIG INVERSIONS Liberty/Virgin Media In February 2013, billionaire John Malone\u2019s Liberty Media cable group acquired Virgin Media, which was then a Delaware-registered media company with virtually all its business in the UK, for $23bn. The deal was structured in such a way that the new enlarged group pays corporation tax in the UK rather than at the 35% level it was previously paying in the US. In addition Liberty used Virgin\u2019s operating losses for future tax advantages. Burger King/Tim Hortons Burger King moved its head office to Ontario earlier this year after its $11bn deal to buy Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons. The deal was a headline writer\u2019s dream, with many referring to the whopping tax savings generated by the enlarged group paying corporation tax at just 26.5%. A KPMG report at the time of the merger ranked Canada as the country with the most business-friendly tax structures. Arris/Pace British company Pace, the world\u2019s largest maker of TV set-top boxes, agreed a $2.1bn takeover by Arris, a US network equipment maker earlier this year in a deal that changed the group\u2019s domicile to the UK. At the time the bidder said it expected the deal to cut the effective tax rate of the new company to about 26-28% from the US rate of 35%. As part of the merger, a new group was incorporated in the UK although its operational headquarters remained in Suwanee, Georgia. Perrigo/Elan Perrigo, a US maker of over-the-counter medicines, agreed to buy the Irish drug group Elan for $8.6bn in 2013, gaining a low tax base in the process. The purchase enabled Perrigo, which is based in Allegan, Michigan, to move its domicile to Ireland, where it could take advantage of the 12.5% rate of corporation tax. David Hellier",

      "bodyText": "An epic four-day splurge by consumers shopping online is expected to result in retailers breaking sales records. Between Black Friday last week and the close of Cyber Monday, shoppers will have spent more than \u00a33bn, analysts believe. Cyber Monday, like last week\u2019s Black Friday, is an American-inspired phenomenon when US retailers offer discounts at the end of the Thanksgiving holiday season in a bid to kickstart a buying frenzy. Research analyst Experian, in conjunction with IMRG, the UK\u2019s industry association for online retailers, is predicting that online sales for Black Friday will hit \u00a31.07bn \u2013 up 32% on last year and the first time internet sales will have exceeded \u00a31bn in a single day. Online spending for Cyber Monday is forecast to total \u00a3943m \u2013 up 31% on the same day in 2014. Retail giant Amazon reported record figures on Friday, saying it had sold more than 7.4 million items at a rate of around 86 items per second, its biggest sales day in the UK. \u201cFor the second year straight, customers in the UK have blown us away with their response to the many great deals on great products that we\u2019ve made available for Black Friday,\u201d said Christopher North, managing director of Amazon.co.uk. The belief that shoppers are increasingly moving online to grab a bargain appears to be borne out by figures from research firm PCA Predict, which found there was a 270% increase in e-commerce activity on Black Friday compared with the previous Friday. It said there had been a 16% rise in consumers going online this Black Friday compared with 2014. But some companies appear to have been a victim of their own success. There were reports that some struggled to keep their websites up and running on Black Friday. John Lewis\u2019s website went down at around 3.20pm. When one disgruntled customer telephoned to confirm an order lost online the retailer said that it was unable to take any orders and to call back in an hour. Shoppers using the Argos website also experienced delays and consumers were confronted with a holding page saying \u201cOops\u2026 Sorry to hold you up\u201d. Multiple errors on the Tesco website were also reported, and between 10am and 11am the website slowed to an 8.4- second page load time. Tesco denied anything was wrong, saying on Twitter: \u201cOur website is fully operational. We\u2019re very happy with our site speed. Feedback from customers today has been very positive.\u201d Other retailers singled out on social media for criticism of supposedly slow websites included fashion hub Boohoo.com, Boots, River Island and Debenhams. Despite what are predicted to be record online sales, there are signs that the Black Friday hype is already starting to evaporate. Some chains have started stretching out the event over the course of a week, resulting in only a limited spike in their sales on key days. This year, for example, supermarket giant Asda opted not to participate.",

      "body": "<p>An epic four-day splurge by consumers shopping online is expected to result in retailers breaking sales records. Between Black Friday last week and the close of Cyber Monday, shoppers will have spent more than \u00a33bn, analysts believe.</p> <p>Cyber Monday, like last week\u2019s Black Friday, is an American-inspired phenomenon when US retailers offer discounts at the end of the Thanksgiving holiday season in a bid to kickstart a buying frenzy.</p> <p>Research analyst Experian, in conjunction with IMRG, the UK\u2019s industry association for online retailers, is predicting that online sales for Black Friday will hit \u00a31.07bn \u2013 up 32% on last year and the first time internet sales will have exceeded \u00a31bn in a single day.</p> <p>Online spending for Cyber Monday is forecast to total \u00a3943m \u2013 up 31% on the same day in 2014.</p> <p>Retail giant Amazon reported record figures on Friday, saying it had sold more than 7.4 million items at a rate of around 86 items per second, its biggest sales day in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cFor the second year straight, customers in the UK have blown us away with their response to the many great deals on great products that we\u2019ve made available for Black Friday,\u201d said Christopher North, managing director of Amazon.co.uk.</p> <p>The belief that shoppers are increasingly moving online to grab a bargain appears to be borne out by figures from research firm PCA Predict, which found there was a 270% increase in e-commerce activity on Black Friday compared with the previous Friday. It said there had been a 16% rise in consumers going online this Black Friday compared with 2014.</p> <p>But some companies appear to have been a victim of their own success. There were reports that some struggled to keep their websites up and running on Black Friday. John Lewis\u2019s website went down at around 3.20pm. When one disgruntled customer telephoned to confirm an order lost online the retailer said that it was unable to take any orders and to call back in an hour.</p> <p>Shoppers using the Argos website also experienced delays and consumers were confronted with a holding page saying \u201cOops\u2026 Sorry to hold you up\u201d.</p> <p>Multiple errors on the Tesco website were also reported, and between 10am and 11am the website slowed to an 8.4- second page load time. Tesco denied anything was wrong, saying on Twitter: \u201cOur website is fully operational. We\u2019re very happy with our site speed. Feedback from customers today has been very positive.\u201d Other retailers singled out on social media for criticism of supposedly slow websites included fashion hub Boohoo.com, Boots, River Island and Debenhams.</p> <p>Despite what are predicted to be record online sales, there are signs that the Black Friday hype is already starting to evaporate. Some chains have started stretching out the event over the course of a week, resulting in only a limited spike in their sales on key days. This year, for example, supermarket giant Asda opted not to participate.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This weekend kicks off the busiest shopping season in many parts of the world \u2013 and, starting Cyber Monday, the most popular season for cyber-attacks. Malicious attacks on shoppers increased 40% on Cyber Monday in 2013 and 2014, according to EnigmaSoftware.com, an anti-malware and spyware company, compared to the average number of attacks on days during the month prior. Other cybersecurity software providers have identified the December holiday shopping season as the most dangerous time of year to make online purchases. \u201cThe attackers know that there are more people online, so there will be more attacks,\u201d said Christopher Budd, Trend Micro\u2019s global threat communications manager. \u201cCyber Monday is not a one-day thing, it\u2019s the beginning of a sustained focus on attacks that go after people in the holiday shopping season.\u201d Budd adds that cyber-attacks often target the hottest items of that holiday shopping season. \u201cIf you\u2019re reading about it in the mainstream press as far as what\u2019s really hot this year, the hackers are too,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever the latest hot gadget is, that\u2019s almost always going to be used as a spam or phishing or social media scam lure, and that\u2019s something that has longevity through the shopping season.\u201d Apple products as well as PlayStation and Xbox-related items have been key targets in years past. Attackers will often advertise deals that may seem too good to be true, either through spam emails, hacked social media posts or fake websites, said Budd. \u201cInstead of going to Amazon.com, someone might go to Google and search \u2018great deals on an Xbox One\u2019,\u201d said Ryan Gerding, a spokesperson for EnigmaSoftware.com. \u201cThere are bad guys who are particularly sophisticated and can make it so that pretty high up in the Google search results there might be a page that promises a ridiculously low price for an Xbox, and someone might click on that and in turn get an infection when they do.\u201d Gerding added that while the risk of attack is ongoing, Cyber Monday marks the beginning of an annual shift in focus for cyber-attackers. \u201cThe bulk of infections during the rest of the year that our customers get, quite honestly, comes because of them visiting adult websites and clicking on areas they probably shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time of year it seems as though a greater percentage are just folks that are trying to do some shopping.\u201d One of the primary modes of attack, according to cybersecurity experts, are social media hacks that send links through direct messages, tweets and wall posts, advertising online discounts. These attacks are particularly successful because users tend to trust recommendations that are posted or sent directly from friends and trusted sources, without considering that their accounts may have been hacked. \u201cYou can send out hundreds of thousands of emails, or you can get one person on social media [to click on a malicious link], and they end up infecting all of their friends,\u201d said Kevin Haley, a security expert for Norton. \u201cIt goes on all their friends\u2019 walls, and a small percentage of those people will click on it, and it cascades through very quickly.\u201d Another common attack during the holiday season takes advantage of the fact that more people are expecting deliveries this time of year, including gifts they may not have purchased themselves. \u201cYou send out a set of spam emails that says \u2018We had a package that we couldn\u2019t deliver. If you want to find out the details, click on this attachment,\u2019 pretending to be UPS or FedEx,\u201d said Haley. \u201cIt works because people really want to know about a package they weren\u2019t expecting. Think about how effective that is during the holiday season, when people are getting lots of packages delivered to their door.\u201d Attackers also use the increase in package deliveries following Cyber Monday to send false emails that appear to be sent from Amazon, Best Buy and other online retailers. \u201cIf you get an email telling you that there\u2019s a problem with one of your online orders, instead of clicking the link in the email, just launch your web browser and type in the address for that retailer, log in and check your shopping cart,\u201d said Gerding. \u201cThere are times when there very well could be a reason for you to get an email telling you there\u2019s a problem with your order, but you can confirm that if you visit the website directly as opposed to clicking on a link [in an email].\u201d Here are 10 more ways to protect yourself online during the holiday season, according to cybersecurity experts: Enable two-step email verification Be wary of suspicious social media posts Don\u2019t click on links in emails and on social media without confirming that they were sent intentionally, no matter the sender Only make online purchases from websites with SSL certificates (usually indicated by a small icon of a lock in the lower right-hand side of the window) Do not download mobile apps outside the Apple App Store, Amazon App Store and Google Play Store Do not use the same password for more than one website, especially banking and email sites Use anti-spyware and anti-malware software Confirm order history and shipping information via the online retailer\u2019s website directly, not through email links Be wary of any online shopping deals that seem too good to be true Keep your applications and operating systems up to date",
