Rebecca Allen, the managing director of Decca records, said: \u201cI honestly believe that the door is wide open to women. Young women I\u2019ve come across in the last few years have no fear and quite frankly stand as tall, if not taller, than their male colleagues. It gets harder for everyone going up the ladder \u2013 men and women. Our industry is so competitive, you\u2019ve just got to be brilliant.\u201d</p> <p>The survey also looked at ethnic diversity and found that at intern and entry levels, the proportion of workers from BAME backgrounds was high, at 24% and 20% respectively.

      "bodyText": "When it was launched by the coalition government in 2012, the Green Investment Bank seemed to be George Osborne\u2019s sop to the Liberal Democrats and their heretical ideas about industrial strategies. A state-funded bank that isn\u2019t a bank \u2013 GIB is an investor in hard-to-finance green projects \u2013 didn\u2019t sound like an adventure that would carry the long-term support of the former chancellor when he was straining to show fiscal discipline. Sure enough, Osborne started talking almost immediately about the need for GIB to stand on its own feet and attract private capital. What\u2019s wrong with that, it might be argued. GIB is supposed to invest only in commercially viable projects and, what\u2019s more, seems to have stuck to its brief. There have been no spectacular blow-ups in a portfolio than runs from windfarms to street-lighting systems. While actual profits are tiny, as one would expect at a young institution investing in long-term assets, projected returns from \u00a32.7bn of investments are pencilled in to be a tidy 10%. Why wouldn\u2019t the private sector wish to put more capital behind GIB and its 140 staff in London and Edinburgh? That, at least, was the thinking and, by stealth, the government convinced itself that only a sale of a majority stake in GIB (or the whole lot) would do. But, don\u2019t worry, the government added in a policy paper last March, the other objectives would be value for money for the public purse and an insistence that the new owner should honour GIB\u2019s green purposes. The result is that, by the end of this month, a sale of GIB to Australian bank Macquarie is likely to be announced. We should be alarmed. That is not only because of weekend stories about Macquarie lining up buyers for GIB projects in an \u201casset stripping\u201d exercise. Investments do not have to be held for infinity, of course, and GIB itself is sometimes a seller. But the real worry here is subtler and more serious: can Macquarie be made to recycle the proceeds of any disposals into GIB-style renewable infrastructure in the UK? The short answer is: no. After a sale, the government is virtually powerless. \u201cIt is not open to the government to impose binding conditions on the future GIB requiring it to act in a particular way,\u201d conceded the March paper. Instead, the government created a \u201cspecial share\u201d arrangement, and a panel of five experts to police it, to ensure that any investments meet the renewable criteria. But what if Macquarie thinks GIB is worth more dead than alive? What if it pays \u00a32bn for GIB, liquidates most of the assets at a handsome profit and then decides the capital is better deployed elsewhere? The government seems to be grossly naive about this possibility. The March paper spoke cheerfully about how potential investors were interested in GIB because of its green specialism and declared: \u201cIt would make no sense to buy the company only to move it away from this focus.\u201d Wake up. It would make perfect sense if a new owner could flip the assets for a large profit and then enjoy a completely free hand on how to spend the proceeds. Macquarie, remember, is a vast financial conglomerate. Yes, it is happy to bore on about how many renewable energy projects it has backed but, in the end, the money flows to where its managers think the best returns will be made. That may not be green projects, or even the UK. It could prefer to pay its shareholders a special dividend. GIB could be lost within the greater Macquarie empire. Theresa May should look at this privatisation afresh. She tells us she wants the UK to have an industrial policy but now she\u2019s selling an institution that, against the odds and from scratch, has done a good job of attracting capital to UK infrastructure on commercial lines. The government says it \u201cwants and expects GIB to continue to invest in green sectors following a sale\u201d but, in the absence of clauses that are binding on Macquarie, that expectation is really just a hope that the Aussies will play nice. Smart financial buyer runs rings around gullible government. It\u2019s an old story, and likely to be repeated unless May intervenes at the 11th hour. She should call the whole thing off, or find a better buyer. Bovis stonewalls over boss\u2019s departure David Ritchie, chief executive of Bovis Homes, has told the board he plans to leave. You can\u2019t blame him. He\u2019s spent 18 years at the Kent-based housebuilder and he\u2019s only 47, which leaves plenty of time to try something else. Hold on, though, what\u2019s this? \u201cThe contractual obligations are being met,\u201d says a Bovis spokesman, using the usual shorthand for a pay-off. Why does Ritchie deserve a pay-off, though? If he has chosen to leave, which is what the announcement said, there should no obligation to pay him beyond his last day in the office, which is the last day of next month. But perhaps Ritchie has \u201cchosen\u201d to leave because the board thought it needs a new chief executive in the wake of the profits warning a fortnight ago. That would be more of an ousting, in which case Ritchie might indeed be contractually entitled to a sum of up to a year\u2019s salary, or \u00a3550,000. So which is it? Did he jump or was he pushed? The deliberate ambiguity is silly, as is the brush-off that all will be revealed in the next annual report. It should not be hard to give shareholders a straight answer on the day that boss says he\u2019s off.",

If he has chosen to leave, which is what the announcement said, there should no obligation to pay him beyond his last day in the office, which is the last day of next month.</p> <p>But perhaps Ritchie has \u201cchosen\u201d to leave because the board thought it needs a new chief executive in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/28/bovis-profit-warning-investors-surprise-housebuilder-shares\">the profits warning a fortnight ago</a>. That would be more of an ousting, in which case Ritchie might indeed be contractually entitled to a sum of up to a year\u2019s salary, or \u00a3550,000.</p> <p>So which is it? Did he jump or was he pushed? The deliberate ambiguity is silly, as is the brush-off that all will be revealed in the next annual report. It should not be hard to give shareholders a straight answer on the day that boss says he\u2019s off.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The pound has fallen to a 10-week low after Theresa May fuelled concerns that UK exporters faced the loss of unfettered access to the European Union\u2019s major economies under a hard Brexit. Over the weekend May said she wanted the best possible deal for leaving the EU, but dismissed the idea that the UK could \u201ckeep bits of membership\u201d, which appeared to quash hopes of retaining access to the single market. The pound fell on Monday against most currencies and especially against the dollar, losing more than 1% to $1.21. However, the index of Britain\u2019s blue chip companies hit a fresh high as multinational corporations that report large incomes in dollars saw their value rise. The FTSE 100 closed at 7,238, up 0.4%, its eighth consecutive day of record highs \u2013 a winning streak it last achieved in May 1997 after Tony Blair\u2019s Labour general election landslide. One analyst said the increasingly belligerent war of words in recent weeks between London and Brussels and the row over the resignation of UK ambassador to the EU Sir Ivan Rogers had left currency market traders in no doubt Britain was heading for a hard Brexit, even before May\u2019s comments. \u201cAfter some respite at the end of last year, the market [was betting against] sterling even before Theresa May gave her interview on Sunday, suggesting that until a clear plan is presented by the government, the market\u2019s fears [dominate] that Brexit will be a disaster for the UK,\u201d said Kathleen Brooks, research director at brokers City Index. Brooks said she expected to see further declines in the coming weeks, \u201cuntil we get some concrete detail about what the UK\u2019s exit from the EU will actually look like\u201d. The Brexit vote in June sent the currency tumbling as traders warned that any restrictions on exports to the EU would harm the UK\u2019s growth prospects. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, steadied the pound after it slumped to $1.18 in October, following remarks that it was important to maintain the strongest possible links with the single market. But persistent falls in the currency\u2019s value during December towards the previous low point has increased the cost of imported goods and forced businesses to say that price rises are in the pipeline. Supermarkets have signalled they will need to increase prices in the coming months, while transport firms are likely to pass on higher petrol and diesel costs. Holiday firms have reported strong sales of summer packages, but the likelihood of a weaker currency reducing the spending power of UK tourists abroad is expected dampen demand. Chris Saint, a currency analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said May\u2019s comments had done \u201clittle to dispel concerns over the apparent lack of a coherent plan for upcoming negotiations\u201d. He said sterling was very likely to become more sensitive to continued signs that the government would adopt a hardline approach as it nears the date for triggering article 50. The pound also fell against the euro to a seven-week low of \u20ac1.15, which Saint said also illustrated the belief among traders that Britain\u2019s economic fate was tied to single market access. Nick Parsons head of market strategy at National Australia Bank, said: \u201cWe think it was the prime minister prioritising immigration over a trade deal that pulled the rung from under sterling.\u201d He added: \u201cThe optimism in late November, early December had been based on an apparent desire to secure a trade deal and yesterday was a marked shift [from] that.\u201d Analysts said separate to the pound\u2019s decline, the dollar was strengthened after signs of higher wages in the December US jobs report, which is expected to persuade the US central bank to raise interest rates. Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, is known for his reticence in raising rates. But even he has said US interest rates could go up three times this year, faster than he expected a few months ago. The FTSE 100, which is dominated by oil and mining companies, has grown strongly in the new year in response to solid economic data and the prospect of higher earnings in dollars. The index is up 8% since November. Miners Anglo American, Glencore and BHP Billiton were among the top gainers, tracking the price of copper higher. \u201cThe FTSE is still currency-led, with Brexit uncertainty over the weekend grinding it higher,\u201d said Mark Ward, head of execution trading at Sanlam Securities UK. \u201cI don\u2019t think these markets will go lower any time soon.\u201d The FTSE small-cap index also hit a new record high of 5,238.08 points in early trade, trading up 0.3% at 5,230.99 points.",

      "bodyText": "Southern trains will be cancelled on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday in the latest strikes on the commuter rail network, as part of a long-running dispute over driver-only services. Severe disruption is also expected on Thursday due to the knock-on effects of the walkout by members of the Aslef union, as well as a continuing overtime ban on a short-staffed network. The strike is expected to cause more crowding and traffic problems in south London, a day after a 24-hour strike on the underground service ended, as people seek alternative travel arrangements. Southern has advised the 300,000 people who commute daily on its network to work from home and not travel if possible. The operator will lay on some bus services to link passengers in counties outside the capital with neighbouring train networks. The walkout follows on from similar action by unions in December. Another three days of strikes will follow from Tuesday 24 January. No end to the row appears imminent, despite an apparent offer of talks from the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, last week. It came after a report issued by the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, declared that Southern\u2019s plans for more trains to operate without guards closing the doors was broadly \u201ca safe method of working\u201d, with the company promising to implement more safety improvements. The leaders of Aslef and the RMT union, which also has 12 driver members on strike, said they would be available for talks, but there is understood to have been no further approach to unions to set a date. Unions argue that reducing the responsibilities of guards and putting more onus on drivers is increasingly unsafe with longer, more crowded trains. However, the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said more than half of trains running in Britain, including the London Underground, operate with drivers closing the doors, and the practice would reduce the time that trains have to wait at stations. Aslef and the RMT have agreed to oppose any further extension of driver-only operation, which could see strikes spread elsewhere in the country as more train companies change their fleets and working practices. Mick Whelan, the Aslef general secretary, said the industry had changed since drivers agreed to the principle, which they now regretted. \u201cWe have always honoured agreements we have got, but trains are working later and longer. We have concerns; we don\u2019t believe that driver-only operation was designed for 12-car trains with 1,000 people on them,\u201d he said. On Monday, the strike by tube staff closed most stations and left many commuters stranded or having to crowd on to rail or bus services, which were also affected by resulting traffic. About 2,500 British Airways crew will strike on Tuesday and Wednesday, although the airline said only a small number of flights from Heathrow would be affected and all passengers booked to travel would reach their destinations.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco is closing two distribution centres in a shakeup of its UK operations that will reduce staff numbers by about 500. Britain\u2019s biggest retailer will close warehouses in Welham Green, Hertfordshire, and Chesterfield, Derbyshire, as well as overhauling the management of its distribution network. This will lead to 1,015 jobs being cut, including 444 at Welham Green, 207 at Chesterfield and 364 in the warehouse management team. However, Tesco intends to create 533 jobs elsewhere in its network, including at warehouses in Reading, Middlesbrough and also in Daventry, Northamptonshire. Some of the affected staff could find different roles within the company. The changes are part of an overhaul of Tesco under chief executive Dave Lewis designed to revitalise the retailer after a slump in sales and profits. Matt Davies, Tesco\u2019s UK chief executive, said: \u201cAs the needs of our customers change, it\u2019s vital we transform our business for the future. As part of this we are proposing to close two of our distribution centres in the UK. These changes will help to simplify our distribution operations so we can continue to serve our customers better. \u201cOur priority throughout this process has been our colleagues and we will continue to do all we can to support them at this time.\u201d The changes will reduce the number of distribution centres that Tesco runs in the UK to 23. The company will move its grocery operation at Welham Green to Reading, while the majority of its non-food products will be distributed from Middlesbrough after the closure of its Chesterfield site. In addition, Tesco will bring all warehouse operations run by logistics groups DHL and Wincanton in-house. This includes withdrawing from a clothing warehouse run by DHL in Daventry and moving its operations to a Tesco centre nearby. Tesco reported a \u00a36.4bn pre-tax loss in 2015, one of the biggest in British corporate history, after a fall in sales and the discovery of a \u00a3326m accounting scandal. Since then, Lewis, who was hired from Unilever, has attempt to rebuild Tesco by cutting prices, introducing new product ranges and improving the availability of key products. However, although like-for-like sales have picked up again in the UK, profits have remained stubbornly low as the company invests in cutting prices and improving its shops. Tesco recorded a 28% fall in pre-tax profits to \u00a371m in its most recent half-year results. In response, Lewis told investors that he had an ambition to improve Tesco\u2019s operating profit margin to between 3.5% and 4% by the end of the decade. It was 2.2% in the last financial results. Tesco, which employs more than 300,000 people in the UK, is scheduled to unveil its trading figures for the vital Christmas period on Thursday. James Anstead, analyst at Barclays \u2013 one of Tesco\u2019s house brokers \u2013 has predicted that the supermarket chain will report that sales during the six weeks to 7 January were flat on the same period the previous year. Anstead said: \u201cIf our forecasts are correct we expect Morrisons to be most pleased with the way in which trading panned out, although we also expect further evidence of Tesco\u2019s ongoing momentum. \u201cWe do know that Tesco\u2019s UK business had a relatively strong Christmas period last year [2015]. That fact does not necessarily bode well for what Tesco might have delivered in December 2016 \u2013 especially considering the underwhelming showing from the company in the most recent set of market share data.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Fiat Chrysler plants in Mexico may close if Trump enacts import tax, CEO says", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of auto giant Fiat Chrysler has warned that the company would have to consider closing its Mexican factories if Donald Trump decides to impose his threat of tough new tariffs on imports from Mexico. Sergio Marchionne, chief executive officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, said on Monday that the entire industry was dogged by uncertainty since Trump\u2019s election and added that if the president-elect followed through on threats to tax Mexican car imports, he would have to consider shutting factories. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that if the economic tariffs that are imposed by the US administration on anything that comes into the United States, if they are sufficiently large, it will make the production of anything in Mexico uneconomical and therefore we will have to move on. It is quite possible,\u201d Marchionne said addressing reporters at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Repurposing the Mexican factory would be \u201ccostly and uncertain\u201d. Asked if he would consider investments in Mexico if he was offered substantial inducements by the Mexican government, Marchionne said it would be \u201cincredibly imprudent on our side to try and make commitments to that country\u201d. A Mexican-US trade war over cars would have \u201crelatively limited\u201d impact on the US \u2013 but would be terrible for Mexico. \u201cIf it\u2019s a rejection of international trade in a wider sense, the implications are much more severe,\u201d he said. Scaling back by US car firms is already hitting Mexico. Julian Eaves, managing director of Preferred Compounding de M\u00e9xico, a US-owned maker of rubber compounds operating in central Mexico, told the Guardian that the economic cost could run into the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars over the next five years, if manufacturing, contracting and indirect jobs fall short of current plans. Marchionne\u2019s comments came shortly after Trump had praised Fiat Chrysler and Ford for announcing new investments in the US. Trump made US auto production a key part of his campaign and won in part with the backing of voters in states with the largest percentage of autoworkers. Last week Ford abandoned plans to build a $1.6bn plant in Mexico and said it would invest $700m in a Michigan plant. On Sunday, Fiat Chrysler announced a $1bn investment in plants in Ohio and Michigan to build new SUVs and pickup trucks that will add 2,000 jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s finally happening \u2013 Fiat Chrysler just announced plans to invest $1BILLION in Michigan and Ohio plants, adding 2000 jobs. This after Ford said last week that it will expand in Michigan and U.S. instead of building a BILLION dollar plant in Mexico. Thank you Ford &amp; Fiat C!\u201d Trump posted on Twitter. Marchionne said he had not spoken to Trump or his advisers and that the \u201cdecision has been in the works for a long time\u201d. Fiat Chrysler \u2013 whose brands include Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep and Maserati \u2013 makes about 17% of its vehicles in Mexico, according to analysts. He said it was difficult for the industry to manage in the current political environment. Trump has threatened to scrap the Northa American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Mexico and Canada, but so far the most detail he has given has been on Twitter. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a new political language, but if it is we\u2019ll adjust to that too,\u201d said Marchionne. On Sunday Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors and a Trump adviser, said GM would not be changing its sourcing decisions because of Trump. \u201cThis is a long-lead business with highly capital-intensive investments \u2013 decisions that were made two, three and four years ago,\u201d Barra told reporters in Detroit. The company also revealed it is planning to build a newly unveiled vehicle, GMC Terrain, a crossover SUV, in San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico. Barra\u2019s comments came after the Trump threatened the company with a \u201cbig border tax\u201d for importing some of GM\u2019s Chevrolet Cruze compact cars from a plant in Mexico. The imported models account for some 5% of the Cruze cars sold in the US. The rest are manufactured at its Ohio factory. On Monday Barra touted GM\u2019s creation of US jobs. \u201cWe have more than 40 manufacturing facilities in the US and over the last two years alone, we have investment more than $11bn creating thousands of new jobs in the US, as well as recruiting technical talent,\u201d Barra said unveiling new vehicles at the Detroit auto show. Michelle Krebs, senior analyst with Autotrader, said the US car firms were reeling from the uncertainty Trump has created. \u201cIt takes four years to develop a vehicle, longer still to build a plant,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an industry that needs clarity.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "VW executive charged with fraud in connection to emissions cheating", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A Volkswagen executive was charged on Monday with conspiracy to defraud the United States in the latest chapter of the long-running scandal over the company\u2019s deliberate cheating on emissions tests. Oliver Schmidt, who was general manager in charge of VW\u2019s environmental and engineering office in Michigan, did not enter a plea at an initial appearance in US district court in Miami on Monday and was ordered held pending a hearing on Thursday. Schmidt, who was shackled and wearing a jail uniform, was charged with fraud and conspiracy in not disclosing a cheating device used to rig US diesel emissions tests from 2006 through 2015. As VW\u2019s former head of compliance in the US from 2014 until March 2015, Schmidt would have been in charge of the company\u2019s adherence to emissions regulations during the scandal, though not at its beginning. He was arrested by FBI agents in Florida on Saturday after attempting to return to Germany from a vacation there, the justice department said. News of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times. The arrest and court appearance come as VW nears a $3bn plus \u2013 and potentially $4bn \u2013 settlement with the justice department and Environmental Protection Agency to resolve civil and criminal investigations into the diesel scandal. Talks are still under way about some details of the settlements and no deal has been reached, sources said. A Volkswagen spokesman, Mario Guerreiro, said the company \u201ccontinues to cooperate with the Department of Justice as we work to resolve remaining matters in the United States\u201d. Individuals affected the world over have filed class-action suits against the company since the scandal was first made public, most recently in the UK on Monday. In September 2015 the company admitted to installing \u201cdefeat devices\u201d on its diesel-powered vehicles, which caused them to emit lower levels of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide during testing.

      "bodyText": "Over in the US, having come within a whisker of the 20,000 barrier on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to head in the other direction on Monday. At the moment the Dow is down 50 points 19913, a fall of around 0.25%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all you comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. A strong euro has taken the shine of European markets which - in contrast to the FTSE 100 - are down on the day. The final scores showed: Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.3% to 11, 563.99 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.45% lower at 4887.57 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.66% to 19,360.02 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.24% at 9492.8 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 659.33 For the eighth day in a row, the FTSE 100 has closed at a new peak, equalling a record set back in 1997. If it closes higher on Tuesday, we would be in uncharted territory. It is also the tenth trading day to see a positive close, itself a new record. Bolstered by the weakness in the pound - partly thanks to Theresa May\u2019s latest comments which seemed to suggest to traders that a hard Brexit is on the way - overseas earners and mining companies are among the main gainers. Overall the FTSE 100 has finished up 27.72 points or 0.38% at a new peak of 7237.77. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Yet again the fall in sterling has become the primary means by which the FTSE has risen, with some of the big names from the summer bounce, such as Reckitt Benckiser and Imperial Brands, making gains. Oil prices are under pressure, with signs of increased US production and record Iraqi exports in December threatening to undermined the recent output curbs agreed by Opec and other producers. Brent crude is currently down 2.9% at $55.43 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 3% lower at $52.37. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Oil prices have slipped back...after US rig counts rose again for the tenth week in succession, and their highest level in twelve months, which has helped temper further gains in the short term, after the highs seen last week. While the prospect of Opec production cuts is expected to underpin the oil price, talking about them and doing them are two different things and given that Iraq saw production hit a record in December, cutting back is likely to be easier said than done, while Iran also reported a rise in exports. MP Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury committee, will call for clarity on Brexit in a speech on Monday evening. As the pound suffers on fears of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d Tyrie will say: The Prime Minister\u2019s decision to come forward soon with high-level objectives is welcome, if not overdue. A document is needed that enables a full and considered consultation with Parliament and the public. Clarification can and should be provided on at least three major issues. First, there is the question of whether the UK will seek to remain a member of the single market, or if not, seek at least to obtain equivalent access for trade in goods and services... Second, the UK needs to decide whether to participate in a customs union with the EU.... Third, and perhaps most important of all, the Government should take the opportunity to clarify whether the UK will seek transitional arrangements under Article 50. This provides that the EU Treaties may continue to apply to the UK, for an agreed period, after the withdrawal negotiations have been completed. This is a very important but apparently misunderstood provision. It has been confused with the separate provision in Article 50, which allows the two-year negotiating period to be extended. The latter requires unanimity; the former would be subject to QMV [qualified majority vote], and is therefore readily negotiable. A \u201cstandstill\u201d at the completion of the negotiations under Article 50 could provide certainty, both about the operating environment for a specified period, and about the point at which the \u201cstandstill\u201d would expire... Given the need to build a broad-based support for its position, at home and abroad, the sooner the Government can provide clarity, the better. The comments come ahead of a select committee hearing on Tuesday concerning the UK\u2019s future economic relationship with the EU. This will hear evidence from HSBC chairman Douglas Flint, Elizabeth Corley, vice chair of Allianz Global Investors, and Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange. Here\u2019s Reuters story on German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s latest comments relating to the UK and single market access: The European Union must consider limiting Britain\u2019s access to its single market if London fails to accept the bloc\u2019s four freedoms in Brexit negotiations, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday. Adding pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May who at the weekend hinted at a \u201chard Brexit\u201d - in which border controls are prioritized over market access - Merkel said there could not be negotiations based on \u201ccherry picking.\u201d Merkel said it was important that \u201cwe also make clear on the other hand that access to the single market can only be possible on the condition of respecting the four basic freedoms. Otherwise one has to talk about limits (of access).\u201d If Britain does not accept the EU\u2019s four freedoms - free movement of goods, capital, services, and people - in Brexit negotiations, there will have to be talks about restricting access to the single market. That\u2019s the latest from German chancellor Angela Merkel, as quoted by Reuters, and reaffirms the EU\u2019s position that single market access is inextricably linked to freedom of movement. US markets have made a negative start to the new week. After coming close enough to touch the elusive 20,000 level on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is slipping away from the record breaking level. A slip in oil prices and downgrades to Procter and Gamble and Coca-Cola, as well as a fall in Goldman Sachs, have helped push the Dow down 64 points to 19899. The S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.13% but the Nasdaq Composite edged up a similar amount. The pound\u2019s new slide could arguably mean it is now looking cheap, says Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com: Though the Brexit vote has only had a limited impact on the economy thus far, the uncertainty could weigh on business spending in the months ahead. Indeed, the resignation of Britain\u2019s top official in Brussels last week has raised question marks over the government\u2019s self-imposed deadline of triggering the official EU exit clause by the end of March. The real impact of Brexit will not be known until after the fact. So, things could look and feel a lot different in the months and years ahead. But the markets are forward-looking by nature and a lot of the negativity has been priced in. Some would argue even that the markets may have overreacted as the economic implications of Brexit may not be as bad as many fear, so the pound should not be this \u201ccheap.\u201d And even if the Bank of England does not actually increase interest rates in the near future, we could have seen the end of the UK\u2019s extraordinary loose monetary policy, he says: When the UK government finally triggers Brexit Article 50 to start the formal process of leaving the EU, the BoE may not necessarily further loosen its policy further in response. The weakness of the pound and the rising prices of oil means inflation could easily overshoot the Bank\u2019s 2% target. Although Mark Carney, the BoE Governor, has indicated that the MPC will tolerate a temporary rise in price levels, it will become hard to justify maintaining that policy if inflation remains high for a long period of time. Thus the MPC may be forced to tighten its belt in order to prevent inflation turning into an unlikely period of hyperinflation, which will be very costly for the economy. If this view is correct, then the pound should start to get its mojo back in the coming months. In the short-term however the technical outlook on the GBP/USD looks rather bearish as it continues to make lower lows and lower highs within its 3.5 month consolidation period. But with the cable now at the lower end of its range, the probability of seeing a bounce rises at an increasing rate by each passing day. Time for a quick catch-up, before Wall Street opens for the week - giving the Dow Jones industrial average another tilt at the 20,000 mark. The pound has slipped to a 10-week low after Theresa May appeared to hint on Sunday that Britain will lose its membership of the single market after Brexit. Amid volatile trading, sterling is currently down almost 1.5 cents at $1.214. The pound is also having a bad day against the euro, down 1.1% at \u20ac1.153. Investors are reacting to May\u2019s appearance on Sky News\u2019s Sunday with Sophy Ridge, in which she insisted Britain wouldn\u2019t retain bits of its existing EU membership. \u201cWe are leaving. We are coming out. We are not going to be a member of the EU any longer.\u201d Asked about the selloff, the PM insisted her comments were consistent with her previous stance - and again vowed to get a good deal for the UK. But experts believe some UK firms are going to suffer if Britain sheds its single market membership, with Commerzbank flagging up the risk of a Brexit disaster. This is from Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit: Other City experts have predicted months of volatility as Britain prepares to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, starting the clock ticking on its departure from the EU. Here\u2019s a round-up of the latest comments. And here\u2019s a graph showing how the pound has been nearly as troubled as the Turkish lira and the Mexican peso of late. But the weak pound is good news for the share prices of global companies listed in London. The FTSE 100 is up 17 points, and on track for a record-equalling 8th closing high in a row. We\u2019ve now got hold of Commerzbank\u2019s latest comments about the pound, and fears of a Brexit disaster (as flagged up earlier). It\u2019s by analyst Esther Reichelt, who says: Sterling is suffering after Prime Minister Theresa May said over the weekend that more detailed plans for the UK\u2019s exit from the EU would be announced over the coming weeks. This announcement was in defence of claims made during the recent resignation of Britain\u2019s ambassador with the EU Ivan Rogers that the British government\u2019s exit plans were muddled. She did not succeed there. Until the government finally presents a concrete and convincing strategy market participants will increasingly fear a disaster. In particular as she signalled once again that the aim of controlling immigration was a red line she would not be willing to cross. That means that following Brexit the country is likely to lose access to the single market. Even though the US President-elect has already signalled an interest in closer ties with its former colonial masters which may well cushion the economic impact of the decision for the UK, what Larry Summers said in his interview about the US also applies to the UK: \u201cif our strategy is to trade only with people that speak English that\u2019s going to be a poor strategy\u201d. The FX market shares this view and as a result Sterling has come under pressure again this morning. Ministers talk a lot about guaranteeing \u201caccess\u201d to the European single market, but that\u2019s not the same as being a member, of course. Writing in the FT, legal expert David Allen Green puts his finger on the difference... This is the second time that the pound has stumbled after Theresa May gave a Sunday TV interview. Back in October, sterling suffered several sharp falls after the PM announced she\u2019d trigger Article 50 within six months. Then, she also pledged to tighten up immigration from the EU, which fuelled fears that the UK would leave the single market (as the free movement of people, goods, services and capital are linked). Trading has been volatile since, with the pound enjoying some good weeks (although plenty of bad ones too), as this chart from Bloomberg shows: Erik Nielsen, global chief economist at UniCredit, told Bloomberg that: \u201cIt looks almost certainly now like a hard Brexit, and the market doesn\u2019t like it. It\u2019s a political crisis in the brewing here, for sure.\u201d Theresa May\u2019s insistence that she\u2019s not aiming for a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 hasn\u2019t brought much relief to the pound. Sterling is still down 1% against the US dollar at $1.216, as traders continue to worry about Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the PM is confusing investors with these messages: The pound has dipped to its lowest level since October on Monday after Prime Minister May said on Sunday that we couldn\u2019t keep bits of the EU, fuelling fears of Hard Brexit. On Monday she said that she doesn\u2019t accept the terms \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 Brexit, and denied that her comments yesterday were a change of stance. This \u2018back-pedalling\u2019 has done nothing to reverse the decline in the pound, which dropped to a low of 1.2125 before lunchtime, and instead makes it likely that further interviews with the Prime Minister will become even harder to score, due to her far from clear message about what Brexit will entail. Prime minister Theresa May has just insisted that she didn\u2019t announce a new policy change on Brexit yesterday. She has told reporters that what she said on Sky News yesterday is consistent with what she\u2019s been saying for the last few months. And the PM also criticises those who write about a \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018soft\u2019 Brexit, saying she doesn\u2019t accept such terms. We are going to get an ambitious, good, a best possible deal for the United Kingdom, in terms of trading with and operating within the single European market. But it will be a new deal, as the country will be outside the EU, May adds. May was speaking after giving a major speech on mental health policy; our Politics Live blog has all the details: After hitting a new alltime high in early trading, the FTSE 100 has dipped back to 7,207, down 3 points. After seven record closing highs in a row, the index may have run out of breath. But if it can struggle into positive territory by 4.30pm, the Footsie will equal its best ever run, set in 1997. Today\u2019s selloff reinforces the pound\u2019s status as one of the weaker currencies of the last 12 months. This neat chart, from City fund manager Paul McNamara of GAM, shows how sterling has performed little better than two struggling emerging market currencies - the Turkish lira and the Mexican peso - since January 2016. As you can see, the pound (in white) had a major slump after the Brexit vote, while the Mexican peso (in green) took a dive when Donald Trump won the US election. Having said that, the pound did strengthen between 2013 and 2015, as economist Rupert Seggins artfully points out: The boss of Rolls-Royce Motors has given Britain a Brexit boost -- saying that the company remains committed to the UK even though it\u2019s leaving the EU. The move calms fears that the luxury carmaker could shift its HQ overseas, as my colleague Rob Davies explains: \u201cSuccess for Rolls-Royce is success for Great Britain and we reaffirm our commitment to maintaining the home of Rolls-Royce in the UK,\u201d chief executive Torsten M\u00fcller-\u00d6tv\u00f6s, told Sky. In a letter leaked to the Guardian last year, M\u00fcller-\u00d6tv\u00f6s told British staff an exit from the European Union would drive up costs and prices and could affect the company\u2019s \u201cemployment base\u201d. But the comments issued alongside the company\u2019s sales figures indicate that even if staff are affected, the company does not plan to abandon its headquarters at Goodwood in West Sussex, southern England. \u201cWe are deeply committed to a long-term, sustainable, successful growth strategy and this result, amid a backdrop of global uncertainty, affirms this approach,\u201d M\u00fcller-\u00d6tv\u00f6s said. Here\u2019s the full story: The slide in the value of sterling against the dollar and the euro this morning has got City experts chattering. Several analysts are predicting more volatility in the next few months, with Britain aiming to trigger Article 50 by the end of May. Here\u2019s some of the best comments: Naeem Aslam of Think Markets: The political crisis is brewing and you can see that when you look at pound. The UK government is playing with fire and creating more uncertainty. Last year, we said that the British pound has tendency of touching the mark of 1.18 against the dollar and we are still maintaining our call. The government needs to be consistent with their message so that market can digest all the bad news and move on with it. You cannot carry on giving conflicting messages as this puts more traders on the side line. Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote bank: The pound was under renewed pressure on Monday as Theresa May suggested that she is willing to go for a full Brexit rather than trying to maintain the UK\u2019s access to the common market by giving up part of the UK\u2019s sovereignty. Since Thursday evening the pound has fallen more than 2% against the greenback as GBP/USD broke the 1.22 support level and continued to move south as traders increased their bearish bet. After last week\u2019s resignation of EU ambassador Ivan Rogers and muddled ongoing talks with the EU, the pressure will continue to mount on the pound. The next support that lies at 1.1841 is within reach and could be reached by the end of the week. John Hardy, Saxo bank\u2019s head of FX strategy \u201cThe most significant thing is May\u2019s comments over the weekend (on a Brexit deal) triggering a significant sterling slide. \u201cMy feeling is we kind of knew this so what did the market expect really, but her making it explicit gives another reason to short sterling maybe\u201d (via Reuters). Neil Wilson of ETX Capital: Domestic populist politics trumps the trade card for now, it seems and that is weighing on the pound, whilst simultaneously giving another boost to the FTSE 100. It\u2019s on track for another record close, in large part because of the weakness in sterling, which has now slumped to its lowest versus the dollar since October. It\u2019s an interesting example of how politics is the key driver for the pound at the moment. And it\u2019s fascinating that a spokeswoman for the prime minister has commented on it - Downing Street may be concerned about what a collapse in the pound means psychologically for voters. For many it can be summed up simple as \u2018weak pound = weak Britain\u2019. Given the susceptibility of the pound to such remarks - which are liable to change and be contradicted by ministers and other officials over the coming weeks - we have to assume that there is going to be more volatility, which may include plenty of short-term upside in sterling - i.e. that it could easily bounce back to levels we\u2019ve seen in the last two months as the tone of the argument swings away from today\u2019s hard Brexit talk, back to soft Brexit. For example, we recently had a rally in sterling when David Davis suggested Britain could pay for access to the single market. Soft Brexit language could help GBPUSD retrace the losses accrued in recent days, but don\u2019t count on it. If cable falls below October\u2019s lows and breaks through the $1.20 level it might be a sign that traders think Britain is heading for a hard landing and it could fall further. The latest economic news from the eurozone is quite encouraging. Unemployment in the euro area remained at 9.8% in December, matching November\u2019s seven-year low (still far too high, of course). And investor sentiment in the euro area has jumped this month. Research group Sentix\u2019s monthly healthcheck has risen to 18.2, from -- with some investors hoping that a Trump presidency could be good for growth. A Downing Street spokeswoman has insisted that Theresa May \u201chasn\u2019t ruled anything in or out\u201d ahead of Brexit negotiations, after the pound tumbled against the dollar this morning. Reuters has the details: British Prime Minister Theresa May is ruling nothing in or out before starting departure talks with the European Union and wants the best deal for businesses to trade with the single market, her spokeswoman said on Monday. The pound fell to two-month lows after traders felt May had indicated during an interview on Sunday that Britain would dramatically rework trade ties with the EU after Brexit. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t ruled anything in or out - she\u2019s said she wants the best possible deal for trading with and operating within the single market,\u201d the spokeswoman said. City analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya says the pound will remain under pressure until the City gets more details of Britain\u2019s post-Brexit deal. The pound is extending its losses, and is now down almost 1.5 cents against the US dollar at $1.2145. That\u2019s a 10-week low. Brexit uncertainty hasn\u2019t hit the UK housing market, according to new figures from the Halifax today. Halifax reports that house prices jumped by 1.7% in December, surprising economists who only forecast a 0.2% rise. On a annual basis, prices were 6.5% higher. This survey only includes data from Halifax\u2019s own customers, so should be treated cautiously (rival mortgage broker Nationwide reported annual growth of 4.5% in December). City PR boss George Trefgarne argues that the pound is suffering from more than just Theresa May\u2019s appearance on the new Sophy Ridge show on Sunday. (FDI= foreign direct investment, or money flowing into the UK from abroad). The pound is getting close to 31-year lows against the US dollar (if you exclude October\u2019s wild \u2018flash crash\u2019 that saw sterling briefly fall below $1.15). PA\u2019s Ian Jones tweets: The Financial Times has got hold of a research note from Germany\u2019s Commerzbank, which says investors fear a Brexit \u2018disaster\u2019 unless the UK produces a decent strategy for leaving the EU. Commerzbank\u2019s Esther Reichelt argues that Theresa May\u2019s opposition to \u201ckeeping bits\u201d of EU membership raise the chances of a hard Brexit, and the loss of full access to the single market. Here\u2019s the key section: Until the government finally presents a concrete and convincing strategy market participants will increasingly fear a disaster. In particular as she [May] signalled once again that the aim of controlling immigration was a red line she would not be willing to cross. That means that following Brexit the country is likely to lose access to the single market. Even though the US President-elect has already signalled an interest in closer ties with its former colonial masters which may well cushion the economic impact of the decision for the UK, what Larry Summers said in his interview about the US also applies to the UK: \u201cif our strategy is to trade only with people that speak English that\u2019s going to be a poor strategy\u201d. The FX market shares this view and as a result Sterling has come under pressure again this morning. More here on the FT. Brexit uncertainty appears to be overriding recent solid UK economic data, including strong service sector growth in December. Jeremy Cook, economist at currency firm World First, explains: Comments made by the Prime Minister on a Sunday morning political talk show suggested, once again, that she and her government therefore favour tighter controls over immigration than access to the single market. This is nothing new but with 11 weeks or so until the proposed invocation of Article 50 details seem to be few and far between. The PM seemed happier to talk about her domestic agenda and will outline further thoughts on the \u2018shared society\u2019 later today in a speech. Of course, the sterling weakness comes despite a strong run of UK data last week; despite the good news markets are reticent to back a currency with such a political schism still unresolved and further economic fall out further unrealised. That being said, conditions are decent for a little bit of sterling strength this week as a result of weakness elsewhere. Trump could go off the rails* when pressed on China, protectionism or the new series of The Apprentice while the euro will have to deal with the latest round of minutes from the ECB (Thursday) and a possible ratings downgrade of Italy (Friday). *--President-elect Trump is due to give a press conference on Wednesday. This chart, from Bloomberg\u2019s Peter Hoskins, shows how the pound has been choppy since its slump in late June: The slump in the pound today has driven Britain\u2019s index of leading blue-chip shares up to a new alltime high in early trading. The FTSE 100 index jumped to 29 points to 7239 points, putting it on track for eight record closing highs in a row. Mining companies are leading the rally, with Anglo American up 2.7% and Glencore gaining 2.2%. A cheap pound drives up the value of multinational firms listed on the Footsie, as it means their overseas earnings are worth more when converted into sterling. So worries about a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 can quickly translate into a weaker currency, but a higher stock market, as Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: The main driver of the index\u2019s growth seemed to be the latest plunge from the pound, which dropped by 0.8% against both the dollar and the euro following Theresa May\u2019s Sky News interview at the weekend. The Prime Minister\u2019s comments were read as falling decidedly on the \u2018hard\u2019 end of the Brexit spectrum, with \u2018control of [the UK\u2019s] borders\u2019 likely to be prioritised over continued access to the single market. The Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn points out that today selloff has wiped out the pound\u2019s recent rally (it rose from $1.21 to $1.27 in November, before dipping in December). Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says that the pound has been main mover in the currency markets \u201cafter UK PM May indicated that the UK won\u2019t try to negotiate continued full access to the European single market when it leaves the EU\u201d. Newsflash! The pound has fallen to its lowest level in over two months, as fears of a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 sweep through the City. Sterling has shed 1% against the US dollar in early trading to $1.2166, down from $1.228. That\u2019s its lowest point since the end of October, and 18% below its value before last June\u2019s referendum. The pound is also suffering against the euro, shedding almost 1 cent as it slips to \u20ac1.155. The selloff has been triggered by Theresa May\u2019s comments yesterday that she wasn\u2019t interested in keeping \u201cbits of membership of the EU\u201d and was determined to control immigration from Europe. In her first major interview of 2017, May told Sky News that: \u201cOften people talk in terms as if somehow we are leaving the EU but we still want to kind of keep bits of membership of the EU. We are leaving. We are coming out. We are not going to be a member of the EU any longer. We will be able to have control of our borders, control of our laws.\u201d That is being taken as a sign that the UK will not retain access to the Single Market after Brexit. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets are certain that this has spooked traders into selling the pound this morning. They say: Comments from UK PM Theresa May in a TV interview broadcast Sunday are being interpreted as an indication that the UK government will prioritise immigration control over single market access in its negotiations on exiting the EU. More reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders trudging to work this morning have two issues on their mind (well, three, if you include today\u2019s tube strike). The first is whether the FTSE 100 can hit a record closing high for the eighth day in a row, which hasn\u2019t happened for 20 years The blue-chip index closed at 7210 points on Friday, and traders reckon it\u2019s going to rise again today. The FTSE\u2019s recent rise is partly due to the weakening pound. And the second issue is whether sterling is heading for another Brexit-induced bath, as worries over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU mount. A 8.30am, the Halifax building society publishes its house price figures, which will show if the sector slowed in December. Europe\u2019s economy is also on the agenda today. The Sentix research group will release its latest survey on investor confidence at 9.30am. And at 10am, we get the latest eurozone unemployment figures for November. We\u2019ve already had solid news from Germany; new figures show that its industrial sector grew by 0.4% last month: We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

The latter requires unanimity; the former would be subject to QMV [qualified majority vote], and is therefore readily negotiable.

Indeed, the resignation of Britain\u2019s top official in Brussels last week has raised question marks over the government\u2019s self-imposed deadline of triggering the official EU exit clause by the end of March. The real impact of Brexit will not be known until after the fact. So, things could look and feel a lot different in the months and years ahead.</p> <p>But the markets are forward-looking by nature and a lot of the negativity has been priced in. Some would argue even that the markets may have overreacted as the economic implications of Brexit may not be as bad as many fear, so the pound should not be this \u201ccheap.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And even if the Bank of England does not actually increase interest rates in the near future, we could have seen the end of the UK\u2019s extraordinary loose monetary policy, he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When the UK government finally triggers Brexit Article 50 to start the formal process of leaving the EU, the BoE may not necessarily further loosen its policy further in response. The weakness of the pound and the rising prices of oil means inflation could easily overshoot the Bank\u2019s 2% target. Although Mark Carney, the BoE Governor, has indicated that the MPC will tolerate a temporary rise in price levels, it will become hard to justify maintaining that policy if inflation remains high for a long period of time. Thus the MPC may be forced to tighten its belt in order to prevent inflation turning into an unlikely period of hyperinflation, which will be very costly for the economy.</p> <p>If this view is correct, then the pound should start to get its mojo back in the coming months. In the short-term however the technical outlook on the GBP/USD looks rather bearish as it continues to make lower lows and lower highs within its 3.5 month consolidation period. But with the cable now at the lower end of its range, the probability of seeing a bounce rises at an increasing rate by each passing day. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-587394b6e4b02851854c2393\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-09T14:15:20.293Z\">2.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">A quick recap</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Time for a quick catch-up, before Wall Street opens for the week - giving the Dow Jones industrial average another tilt at the 20,000 mark.</strong></p> <p>The pound has slipped to a 10-week low after Theresa May appeared to hint on Sunday that Britain will lose its membership of the single market after Brexit.</p> <p>Amid volatile trading, sterling is currently down almost 1.5 cents at $1.214.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e92b3fa26b737ba4a8fed337462522b33c682e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e92b3fa26b737ba4a8fed337462522b33c682e9/0_0_936_508/500.jpg\" alt=\"Pound vs US dollar over the last 12 months\" width=\"500\" height=\"271\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pound vs US dollar over the last 12 months</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pound is also having a bad day against the euro, down 1.1% at \u20ac1.153.</p> <p>Investors are reacting to May\u2019s appearance on Sky News\u2019s Sunday with Sophy Ridge, in which she insisted Britain wouldn\u2019t retain bits of its existing EU membership. \u201cWe are leaving.

The UK government is playing with fire and creating more uncertainty. Last year, we said that the British pound has tendency of touching the mark of 1.18 against the dollar and we are still maintaining our call.</p> <p> The government needs to be consistent with their message so that market can digest all the bad news and move on with it. You cannot carry on giving conflicting messages as this puts more traders on the side line.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote bank:</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound was under renewed pressure on Monday as Theresa May suggested that she is willing to go for a full Brexit rather than trying to maintain the UK\u2019s access to the common market by giving up part of the UK\u2019s sovereignty.</p> <p>Since Thursday evening the pound has fallen more than 2% against the greenback as GBP/USD broke the 1.22 support level and continued to move south as traders increased their bearish bet. After last week\u2019s resignation of EU ambassador Ivan Rogers and muddled ongoing talks with the EU, the pressure will continue to mount on the pound. The next support that lies at 1.1841 is within reach and could be reached by the end of the week.</p> </blockquote> <h2>John Hardy, Saxo bank\u2019s head of FX strategy</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe most significant thing is May\u2019s comments over the weekend (on a Brexit deal) triggering a significant sterling slide.</p> <p> \u201cMy feeling is we kind of knew this so what did the market expect really, but her making it explicit gives another reason to short sterling maybe\u201d (via Reuters).</p> </blockquote> <h2>Neil Wilson of ETX Capital:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Domestic populist politics trumps the trade card for now, it seems and that is weighing on the pound, whilst simultaneously giving another boost to the FTSE 100. It\u2019s on track for another record close, in large part because of the weakness in sterling, which has now slumped to its lowest versus the dollar since October. </p> <p>It\u2019s an interesting example of how politics is the key driver for the pound at the moment. And it\u2019s fascinating that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jan/09/pound-hard-brexit-fears-ftse-100-hits-another-record-high-business-live?page=with:block-58735f39e4b02851854c226f#block-58735f39e4b02851854c226f\">a spokeswoman for the prime minister has commented on it</a> - Downing Street may be concerned about what a collapse in the pound means psychologically for voters. For many it can be summed up simple as \u2018weak pound = weak Britain\u2019.</p> <p>Given the susceptibility of the pound to such remarks - which are liable to change and be contradicted by ministers and other officials over the coming weeks - we have to assume that there is going to be more volatility, which may include plenty of short-term upside in sterling - i.e. that it could easily bounce back to levels we\u2019ve seen in the last two months as the tone of the argument swings away from today\u2019s hard Brexit talk, back to soft Brexit.</p> <p>For example, we recently had a rally in sterling when David Davis suggested Britain could pay for access to the single market.

    "webTitle": "Mike Ashley criticises shareholders of Sports Direct over Keith Hellawell", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley has criticised Sports Direct shareholders who refused to back the re-election of Keith Hellawell as chairman and publicly questioned the company\u2019s corporate governance. The founder and chief executive of Sports Direct said supportive comments about the retailer and Hellawell from the hedge fund manager Crispin Odey were \u201chighly significant at a time when others have been less forthcoming\u201d. Odey, whose fund owns about 5% of Sports Direct, has said Ashley is a \u201cnatural winner\u201d and he is \u201cvery happy with him\u201d. He was speaking in an interview with the Times last week after Sports Direct\u2019s independent shareholders again voted against the re-election of the former police chief constable Hellawell. In an unusual stock market statement on Monday, Ashley welcomed Odey\u2019s support for the company. \u201cI am grateful for Crispin\u2019s recent comments about Sports Direct and I\u2019m glad that we will no doubt continue to have an interesting ride together,\u201d he said. \u201cI consider his backing to be highly significant at a time when others have been less forthcoming. \u201cI\u2019m particularly pleased that we are in agreement over the fact that Keith Hellawell is the right man to help deliver further progress. We now intend to concentrate on our medium and long-term goals in order to deliver shareholder value through becoming the \u2018Selfridges of sport\u2019.\u201d But Odey has criticised the billionaire tycoon in the past, saying Ashley could not be \u201chouse trained\u201d and his failure to appoint a permanent finance director was a \u201cbig concern\u201d, and meant there was \u201ctoo much power in one person\u2019s hands\u201d. Sports Direct has not had a permanent finance director for more than three years. While Odey voted in favour of Hellawell remaining chairman, a string of other major shareholders and City institutions, including Standard Life, Royal London, Hermes and Aberdeen Asset Management, opposed his re-election. Shareholders forced the vote at an extraordinary general meeting last week by rejecting Hellawell at Sports Direct\u2019s annual meeting last September. A total of 54% of votes from Sport Direct\u2019s outside shareholders were against Hellawell\u2019s re-election at the latest meeting. However, he was re-elected to the board after winning 81% of the total vote thanks to the support of Ashley, who owns 55% of the company. Ashley\u2019s majority stake did not count towards the independent vote on Hellawell\u2019s re-election at the first meeting. Hellawell has said he will step down at Sports Direct\u2019s next annual meeting if he does not win the support of the majority of independent shareholders again. However, Ashley said last week that he wants Hellawell to reconsider his position, which inflamed relations with some investors further. Sports Direct also appeared to row back on a commitment to conduct an independent review of working conditions and corporate governance. \u201cIn view of continuing frustrations, the board will meet in the near future to reconsider all options in relation to its review of corporate governance,\u201d it said. The company\u2019s reaction to the vote prompted swift criticism. Paul Lee, the head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: \u201cThe board should focus on delivering the significant governance change that is expected over the next eight months.\u201d Hellawell criticised MPs, trades unions and the media last month for waging a campaign against Sports Direct as it reported a 57% fall in first-half profits. It was the latest disappointing financial statement after the company\u2019s share price halved during 2016. The group was relegated from the FTSE 100 in March. The crisis at Sports Direct was triggered by a Guardian investigation in 2015, which revealed that workers at its Derbyshire warehouse were paid less than the minimum wage. The scandal prompted a parliamentary inquiry last year, in which MPs likened the depot to a Victorian workhouse, reigniting long-held concerns about the level of control Ashley has at the company.",

      "bodyText": "The major US investment firm Blackrock has become the biggest shareholder in Lloyds Banking Group, usurping the government, which is selling down its stake in the bailed-out bank. Blackrock, which describes itself as the world\u2019s biggest fund manager with $5.1tn (\u00a34.1tn) of investments, now owns the largest stake in Lloyds as the Treasury\u2019s holding has fallen to 5.95%. The Treasury makes a disclosure to the stock market every time its stake in Lloyds falls by one percentage point and a previous update last month showed its holding had fallen below 7%. In a stock market announcement on Monday, the Treasury said it had sold a further 700,000 shares to push its stake below 6%. It did not disclose the price it received but the closing price of Lloyds shares on Friday, the day of the sale, was 65.68p. A sale at that price would have raised \u00a3460,000. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has sanctioned sales below the average price of 73.6p a share at which taxpayers bought a 43% stake during 2008 and 2009, when Lloyds was rescuing HBOS. The government pumped \u00a320.3bn into Lloyds and, even though it is now selling the shares below the average price paid for them, it has calculated it has received \u00a318bn back. Hammond said: \u201cConfirmation that we are no longer the largest shareholder in the bank and that we\u2019ve now recouped over \u00a318bn for UK taxpayers is further evidence that we are on track to recover all of the \u00a320bn injected into the bank during the financial crisis.\u201d Blackrock does not disclose its precise holding in Lloyds but stock market rules introduced in May 2015 required it to inform investors that it had risen above the 5% threshold. The slump in Lloyds shares at the start of last year hammered the government\u2019s plan to offer the public cut-price shares. A year ago, George Osborne had postponed the retail offering in the midst of a global stock market rout while Hammond called it off entirely after the vote for Brexit. Lloyds has been trying to put its crisis-ridden past behind it. It announced last month it would spend \u00a31.9bn buying MBNA, a credit card business, from Bank of America. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, Lloyds\u2019 chief executive, said the latest sell-off was a key milestone for the bank. The government stake in Royal Bank of Scotland remains at 73% after Osborne sold off 5% in August 2015 at a \u00a31bn loss.",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of British motorists have launched a lawsuit against Volkswagen over the \u201cdieselgate\u201d emissions scandal, in a claim that could end up costing the carmaker billions of pounds. The group of 10,000 VW owners has filed a class action lawsuit against the German car firm, seeking \u00a330m, or \u00a33,000 each. The chair of a parliamentary committee on the environment and consumer group Which? both welcomed the claim, which VW said it would \u201crobustly\u201d contest. If the company had to pay \u00a33,000 to each of the 1.2 million people who own affected cars, including its \u0160koda, Audi and Seat marques, it would cost about \u00a33.6bn. The German firm has yet to reach a settlement with British and European owners affected by the scandal, in which the company admitted using \u201cdefeat devices\u201d to cheat emissions tests, making its cars appears greener than they were. It has not compensated British owners despite reaching a \u00a315bn settlement with 500,000 US drivers, offering instead to fix affected vehicles. The class action suit, which is being led by law firm Harcus Sinclair, is expected to claim that drivers should be compensated because they paid extra for what they thought were clean diesel cars. In fact, Harcus Sinclair alleged in a statement on its website that the cars emitted far higher levels of NOx \u2013 a mixture of pollutants nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide \u2013 than stated. According to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, NOx emissions cause 23,000 premature deaths in the UK each year. The law firm\u2019s application for group litigation, which is free for claimants to join, will be heard in the high court on 30 January. Damon Parker, the head of litigation at Harcus Sinclair, told the Daily Mail claimants were \u201cangry and believe that VW might get away with it\u201d. \u201cThey feel that they have been left with no choice but to take legal action. We have paved the way for consumers who trusted but were let down by VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda to seek redress through our courts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt it only right that UK car owners affected by the scandal have the opportunity to seek compensation. We have secured funding so that those affected can bring this claim against VW at no cost to themselves. \u201cThe group action aims to ensure that, if VW is found to have misled consumers about the environmental damage caused by their cars, they are penalised accordingly so as to discourage this sort of behaviour from happening again.\u201d Parker criticised VW\u2019s offer to fix cars affected by the scandal without offering compensation. He said: \u201cConsumers are doubtful that the fixes will lower toxic emissions. But getting their cars fixed is not enough. The damage to the environment has been done.\u201d A VW spokesman said: \u201cWe have been notified that Harcus Sinclair intends to bring proceedings against Volkswagen on behalf of 77 claimants in the English high court.We intend to defend such claims robustly.\u201d Vickie Sheriff, director of campaigns and communications at Which?, said: \u201cWhich? agrees that VW must not be let off the hook. Volkswagen customers in the UK will rightly question why US consumers are getting compensation and there is still nothing on the table for the 1.2 million owners affected in this country. \u201cThe UK government also has a responsibility to ensure that UK customers are treated fairly. It simply has not done enough to hold VW to account throughout this scandal.\u201d Harcus Sinclair is collaborating on the case with other law firms, including Slater &amp; Gordon. Jacqueline Young, head of group litigation at Slater and Gordon, said: \u201cVW has shown utter contempt, not just for the rights and health of their UK consumers but also for the environment. This legal action is the best opportunity that British customers will have for holding VW to account over this scandal.\u201d Mary Creagh MP, a Labour politician and chair of the House of Commons environmental audit committee, said: \u201cIn the US Volkswagen faces multibillion-dollar payouts to drivers in environmental fines and in compensating motorists who purchased vehicles with cheat devices. \u201cLast July the Commons environmental audit committee called on the transport secretary to measure the contribution that Volkswagen\u2019s cheat devices made to meeting UK emissions standards, and use the results with a view to pursuing court action in the UK. \u201cIn the absence of government action, it is inevitable that motorists would take matters into their own hands and pursue private action in the courts.\u201d The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has previously called for the capital\u2019s drivers to be compensated, including \u00a32.5m for Transport for London in lost congestion charge payments.",

      "bodyText": "The average UK house price surged by nearly \u00a34,000 in December in the fastest acceleration in values since the Brexit vote, according to Halifax. Prices rose by 1.7% in December alone, reaching a new all-time high of \u00a3222,484 and pushing the ratio of house prices to earnings to 5.81, just shy of its all-time high of 5.83 in July 2007 before the financial crisis struck. The latest surge in prices follow a slew of end-of-year predictions forecasting a marked slowdown in the market in 2017. Halifax said prices in the final quarter of the year were 2.5% higher than in the previous quarter, while the annualised rate of increase rose to 6.5% in December from 6% in November. Luton, a one-hour commute from central London, recorded the biggest percentage rise in house prices among major UK towns and cities over the past year, according to recent separate research by Halifax. Prices in the Bedfordshire town jumped by 19.4% in 2016 from \u00a3214,934 to \u00a3256,636. The eastern outer London borough of Barking and Dagenham experienced the second biggest rise in average house prices with an increase of 18.6%. Dunstable \u2013 Luton\u2019s near neighbour \u2013 completed the top three with a 17.9% rise. Martin Ellis, Halifax housing economist, predicts that house price inflation will subside in 2017 despite December\u2019s surge. \u201cHouse prices finished 2016 strongly. Slower economic growth, pressure on employment and a squeeze on spending power, together with affordability constraints, are expected to reduce housing demand during 2017. \u201cUK house prices should, however, continue to be supported by an ongoing shortage of property for sale, low levels of housebuilding, and exceptionally low interest rates. Overall, annual house price growth nationally is most likely expected to slow to 1%-4% by the end of 2017. The relatively wide range for the forecast reflects the higher than normal degree of uncertainty regarding the prospects for the UK economy this year.\u201d While final year-end figures for transactions have yet to be announced, Halifax estimates total UK home sales for 2016 will be broadly unchanged from 2015 and 2014, at about 1.2m. \u201cNearly six months on from the Brexit thunderbolt, prices are once again picking up speed slowly and steadily,\u201d said Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders. \u201cThe chronic imbalance between demand and supply is playing a big part in driving up prices.\u201d Russell Quirk of online estate agent eMoov said economists are wrong to predict flat or falling prices in 2017. \u201cIt would seem positive news on house prices simply will not go away despite the efforts of some to make us accept that the market will weaken in the wake of EU referendum angst. \u201cAs we have said time and again, the UK housing market is fundamentally robust, bulletproof even, and we do not subscribe to the view of the naysayers that we will see price reductions in 2017. The clever money, given today\u2019s numbers, is yet more positive news which will serve to underpin the overall economy this year.\u201d Economist Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight raised his forecast for 2017 house prices from zero to 2%. \u201cThis is a modest upward revision from our previous forecast of flat house prices in 2017 due to the fact that house prices are carrying more momentum into 2017 than we had expected and also the fact that we have slightly upgraded our UK GDP growth forecast for 2017 to 1.4% (from 1.3%). \u201cWe believe the fundamentals for house buyers will progressively deteriorate during 2017 with consumers\u2019 purchasing power weakening markedly and the labour market likely softening. Increasing economic uncertainty is also likely to weigh down on consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major transactions such as buying a house. Housing market activity and prices are also likely to be pressurised by stretched house prices to earnings ratios and tight checking of prospective mortgage borrowers by lenders.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce Motor Cars has vowed not to turn its back on the UK amid concerns that firms could shift their headquarters overseas in response to the Brexit vote. The luxury carmaker, which is owned by Germany\u2019s BMW, posted its second-highest annual sales in more than a century, up 6% on last year to 4,011 vehicles. The chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars took the opportunity to pledge the firm\u2019s future in the UK, just months after he warned staff that their jobs could be affected by Brexit. \u201cSuccess for Rolls-Royce is success for Great Britain and we reaffirm our commitment to maintaining the home of Rolls-Royce in the UK,\u201d Torsten M\u00fcller-\u00d6tv\u00f6s, told Sky. In a letter leaked to the Guardian last year, M\u00fcller-\u00d6tv\u00f6s told British staff an exit from the European Union would drive up costs and prices and could affect the company\u2019s \u201cemployment base\u201d. But the comments issued alongside the company\u2019s sales figures indicate that even if staff are affected, the company does not plan to abandon its headquarters at Goodwood in West Sussex, southern England. \u201cWe are deeply committed to a long-term, sustainable, successful growth strategy and this result, amid a backdrop of global uncertainty, affirms this approach,\u201d M\u00fcller-\u00d6tv\u00f6s said. \u201c2016 has proven the perfect year to sign off the successful first chapter of the renaissance of Rolls-Royce.\u201d In M\u00fcller-\u00d6tv\u00f6s\u2019 letter to staff, he said Rolls-Royce and the wider BMW Group would be adversely affected by Brexit. \u201cFree trade is important for international business,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRolls-Royce Motor Cars exports motor cars throughout the EU and imports a significant number of parts through the region. \u201cFor BMW Group, more than half of Minis built and virtually all the engines and components made in the UK are exported to the EU, with over 150,000 new cars and many hundreds of thousands of parts imported from Europe each year. \u201cTariff barriers would mean higher costs and higher prices and we cannot assume the UK would be granted free trade with Europe from outside the EU. \u201cOur employment base could also be affected, with skilled men and women from most EU countries included in the 30 nationalities currently represented at the home of Rolls-Royce here at Goodwood.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are on course for an eighth successive closing high, equalling the record set in 1997. The FTSE 100 is currently up 17.83 points at 7227.88, as the slump in sterling following Theresa May\u2019s latest hints at a hard Brexit boosted overseas earnings. Mining shares are among the gainers, with Glencore up 7.05p at 295.50p and Anglo American adding 24.5p at 1159.5p. But Lloyds Banking Group is 0.5p lower at 65.4p after the UK government sold down another part of its shareholding, leaving Blackrock as the bank\u2019s biggest investor. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Today\u2019s announcement confirms that more shares have been sold to the institutions through the trading plan and the taxpayer is no longer the largest shareholder in Lloyds. The taxpayer stake has now fallen below 6%. Retail investors had the disappointment of being denied involvement in a Lloyds share sale, although there is still time and plenty of opportunity to rectify this with the remaining [near] \u00a32bn stake. Engineering support and outsourcing group Babcock International has lost 14.5p to 925p as analysts at Deutsche Bank moved from buy to hold: We like Babcock\u2019s unique market position and high barriers to entry but downgrade to Hold as we do not see enough upside at this time. The stock is not expensive, leaving room for some price recovery on e.g. contract news, but in our view investors will need to see repeated strong reporting for a material and sustainable re-rating. While cash generation has been good, certain drags mean the valuation on cash metrics looks less attractive than on earnings multiples. Organic growth should improve next year, however we remain cautious on UK outsourcing as a whole and are not prepared to assume a return to previously seen growth levels. Fellow outsourcer Capita has fallen13p to 502.5p and is leading the FTSE 100 fallers. Among the other losers William Hill is down 11.1p to 286.6p as the bookmaker warned annual profits would come in at the lower end of expectations at \u00a3260m. In November it said they would be at the higher end of a \u00a3260m to \u00a3280m range. The company, which is searching for a new chief executive, blamed \u201cunfavourable football and horseracing results impacting the sector in December.\u201d Interim chief executive Philip Bowcock said the \u201ccustomer friendly results at the back end of the year\u201d meant profits were \u00a320m below expectations. The company has been the subject of failed bids recently, and faces increased competition as rivals merge to gain critical mass. Numis analyst Richard Stuber said: Whilst a profit warning on the back of a gross margin miss should not be overstated, this is the 3rd warning in 12 months and focuses us once again on William Hill\u2019s near term shortcomings, including UK retail exposure, losing market share online and the lack of a permanent CEO. Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s Hyett said: We can forgive a run of poor sporting results. An unbroken run of Chelsea wins in the period covered by today\u2019s announcement, for example, won\u2019t have been enjoyable for any of the bookies and is clearly beyond William Hill\u2019s control. The bigger problem is that while performance in the online division is improving, it\u2019s doing so at a snail\u2019s pace. With the distracting merger talks of last year now behind it, the group seems to be knuckling down to the job of sorting out the core business. Hopefully, the renewed focus and improving trends will start to deliver some results. Canaccord Genuity said: Management pointed to an ongoing improvement in wagering in Online and also in its Australian business through its second half. So operationally, there are some signs of recovery. But as expected, the group was hit by a particularly weak run of results through December across Football (not just the Premier League) and Racing. On Boxing Day, for example, the top 6 Premier League teams all won, as did the favourite in the King George V1 Chase. As a result, operating profit for 2016 will come in at \u201caround\u00a3260m\u201d, right at the bottom of its guidance range,which compares with our \u00a3275.2m forecast. Elsewhere Ashmore has dropped 7% to 277.9p as Barclays cut its target price on the emerging markets specialist from 325p to 270p, with an underweight rating. It said: We remain cautious on EM-exposed names, given rising US yields and deteriorating EM sentiment after the US elections.",

      "bodyText": "British companies are grappling with higher costs and bracing for further pressure in the months ahead as the start of Brexit talks threatens to drag the pound down further and ramp up the price of imports to the UK. Reports from the manufacturing and construction sectors on Monday point to a sharp rise in the prices paid for materials by firms in Britain and worries that their profit margins will be squeezed as they decide how much of those higher costs they can pass on to customers. Manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF flagged up higher costs in its latest survey of 281 senior executives although it found companies were generally upbeat about their own prospects in 2017, with hopes for improved sales. In the report, the EEF said: \u201cCompanies have experienced a surge in input costs, which soared to multiyear highs. As the weak pound is expected to prevail, cost pressures will be gradually feeding through into higher consumer prices in the year ahead.\u201d Separate research by the Federation of Master Builders found 70% of the 232 UK construction companies it polled had recorded an increase in material prices owing to the pound\u2019s fall since the Brexit vote. Sarah McMonagle, director of external affairs at the group, said: \u201cThousands of smaller building firms are grappling with the rising cost of materials caused by the depreciation of sterling since the EU referendum. \u201cAnecdotally, construction SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] are already reporting an increase of 22% in Spanish slate and a 20% increase in timber. A quarter of all materials used by the UK construction industry are imported \u2013 this is significant and underlines the vulnerability of the industry to sudden fluctuations in the strength of our currency.\u201d Economists have warned that the pound faces further swings on foreign exchanges with the triggering of article 50, expected by the end of March, to kick off formal talks to leave the EU. Some predict the effects of the pound\u2019s weakness will lift headline inflation in the UK from 1.2% on the latest reading to as high as 3% by year end. The EEF\u2019s poll noted pressures from other sources in 2017. With voters going to the polls in France, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as Donald Trump\u2019s presidency marking a change of direction in US politics, a large proportion of manufacturers said their companies faced more risks than opportunities in 2017. Almost half, or 46%, said risks outstripped opportunities while 23% said there were more opportunities than risks. EEF\u2019s chief economist, Lee Hopley, said: \u201cThere is a real sense that there are way more risks than opportunities out there, obviously that is exacerbated by Brexit but we are not going to leave the EU in 2017.\u201d Hopley said that despite their worries and with big questions over what kind of trade deal the UK would end up securing, manufacturers were generally hopeful of better sales this year and were still investing in productivity improvements. \u201cThe message we are getting from manufacturers is you can\u2019t afford to sit on your hands for 18 months,\u201d she said. The survey also showed a rise in the proportion of firms that think the UK was a competitive place to base a manufacturing business in the next 12 months. \u201cFor the next 12 months at least, respondents are positive, on balance, about the UK as a place to manufacture. Whilst this is encouraging, it could reflect perceptions about the current attractiveness of other locations, with unpredictability not just a UK phenomenon,\u201d the report said. Companies were less upbeat about their profitability as they get to grips with higher costs, Hopley said. The pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote has made imports such as fuel and metals more expensive. On the other hand, some firms have reported a boost to exports as the weak pound makes products and services cheaper in overseas markets. The Construction Products Association (CPA) suggested its members had experienced higher prices and were expecting further increases. Among those companies that made \u201cheavy side\u201d materials such as steel and bricks 78% reported an increase in annual costs. Among those making \u201clight side\u201d products such as insulation and lighting, 71% had seen an increase. Rebecca Larkin, a CPA senior economist, said: \u201cRising costs of imported raw materials continue to be a primary driver of cost inflation, but there is now an indication that currency weakness is filtering through to higher energy and fuel costs too. \u201cThe impact of Brexit on the construction industry is, as yet, unclear, but it is unlikely this year will be as buoyant as last unless government is able to provide greater certainty and the industry is able to manage cost pressures.\u201d",

As the weak pound is expected to prevail, cost pressures will be gradually feeding through into higher consumer prices in the year ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Separate research by the Federation of Master Builders found 70% of the 232 UK construction companies it polled had recorded an increase in material prices owing to the pound\u2019s fall since the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Sarah McMonagle, director of external affairs at the group, said: \u201cThousands of smaller building firms are grappling with the rising cost of materials caused by the depreciation of sterling since the EU referendum.</p> <p>\u201cAnecdotally, construction SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] are already reporting an increase of 22% in Spanish slate and a 20% increase in timber. A quarter of all materials used by the UK construction industry are imported \u2013 this is significant and underlines the vulnerability of the industry to sudden fluctuations in the strength of our currency.\u201d</p> <p>Economists have warned that <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-forex-poll-sterling-idUKKBN14Q1FI\">the pound faces further swings on foreign exchanges with the triggering of article 50</a>, expected by the end of March, to kick off formal talks to leave the EU. Some predict the effects of the pound\u2019s weakness will lift headline inflation in the UK from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/13/uk-inflation-november-petrol-clothing-ons\">1.2% on the latest reading</a> to as high as 3% by year end.</p> <p>The EEF\u2019s poll noted pressures from other sources in 2017. With voters going to the polls in France, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as Donald Trump\u2019s presidency marking a change of direction in US politics, a large proportion of manufacturers said their companies faced more risks than opportunities in 2017. Almost half, or 46%, said risks outstripped opportunities while 23% said there were more opportunities than risks.</p> <p>EEF\u2019s chief economist, Lee Hopley, said: \u201cThere is a real sense that there are way more risks than opportunities out there, obviously that is exacerbated by Brexit but we are not going to leave the EU in 2017.\u201d</p> <p>Hopley said that despite their worries and with big questions over what kind of trade deal the UK would end up securing, manufacturers were generally hopeful of better sales this year and were still investing in productivity improvements.</p> <p>\u201cThe message we are getting from manufacturers is you can\u2019t afford to sit on your hands for 18 months,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>The survey also showed a rise in the proportion of firms that think the UK was a competitive place to base a manufacturing business in the next 12 months.</p> <p>\u201cFor the next 12 months at least, respondents are positive, on balance, about the UK as a place to manufacture. Whilst this is encouraging, it could reflect perceptions about the current attractiveness of other locations, with unpredictability not just a UK phenomenon,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Companies were less upbeat about their profitability as they get to grips with higher costs, Hopley said. The pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/05/uk-economy-ends-2016-on-high-but-rising-import-prices-bite\">made imports such as fuel and metals more expensive</a>. On the other hand, some firms have reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/01/weak-pound-boosts-uk-manufacturing-steep-import-cost-rise\">a boost to exports</a> as the weak pound makes products and services cheaper in overseas markets.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Construction Products Association (CPA) suggested its members had experienced higher prices and were expecting further increases. Among those companies that made \u201cheavy side\u201d materials such as steel and bricks 78% reported an increase in annual costs. Among those making \u201clight side\u201d products such as insulation and lighting, 71% had seen an increase.</p> <p>Rebecca Larkin, a CPA senior economist, said: \u201cRising costs of imported raw materials continue to be a primary driver of cost inflation, but there is now an indication that currency weakness is filtering through to higher energy and fuel costs too. </p> <p> \u201cThe impact of Brexit on the construction industry is, as yet, unclear, but it is unlikely this year will be as buoyant as last unless government is able to provide greater certainty and the industry is able to manage cost pressures.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Half of today\u2019s car owners will not want to own a vehicle and more and more will want self-driving and electric cars in future, a survey of car manufacturing bosses has found. As fewer people see the need to buy a car, a majority of automotive executives believe the industry will increasingly focus on making money from peripheral digital services to be used with their vehicles. The results suggest that producing driverless, electric vehicles to sell to tech firms, such as Google or Apple, that consumers would then pay to use could be a growth area in the industry in the coming years, according to an analyst. \u201cI believe robot taxis will revolutionise UK urban transportation in the second half of the next decade,\u201d said John Leech, UK Head of Automotive at KPMG, which produced the report. \u201cThe UK is particularly suited to the early adoption of self-driving cars consumed as a service. Our greenbelt policy has created a relatively dense urban population which, when coupled with our high fuel prices, means that so-called robot taxis offer a greater cost saving to the UK public, compared to European or North American markets.\u201d However, manufacturers thought it was more likely that the prevailing business model in 2025 would be centred on producing a vehicle with technological add-ons. They placed the more traditional production of cars and sale through dealerships second, while selling a connected car then maintaining a relationship with the driver using the vehicle\u2019s connectivity was third. About 20% of executives, among them many from India, China and south-east Asia, felt the industry would focus more on selling vehicles directly to tech firms \u2013 in particular, those whose brand image is not as strong with the public. Moreover, the report said 74% of executives thought more than half of car owners today would not want to own a vehicle in the future. And 85% of the executives surveyed were convinced their company might make more money by providing the new digital services than by selling cars alone. \u201cCarmakers plan to sell a myriad of new digital services to vehicle users. Today, carmakers already make substantial profits from the sale of consumer finance and annual vehicle insurance but this will grow in the future as innovative services such as remote vehicle monitoring and the integration of the car as a focal point in people\u2019s ever more connected lifestyles are demanded by consumers,\u201d said Leech. \u201cFor the auto industry this implies that pure product profitability is outdated. Carmakers\u2019 success will not be evaluated solely on the quantity of vehicles sold, but on the customer value over the whole lifecycle \u2013 especially when the digital ecosystem will be ready for the market.\u201d The report also found that executives expect diesel technology to become a thing of the past. More than 90% of them plan to invest in the technology needed for battery electric vehicles over the next five years, while 62% felt that diesel was losing its importance for manufacturers. Figures from the annual global automotive executive survey also showed that 90% of bosses expect battery electric vehicles to dominate the marketplace by 2025. Leech said: \u201cImprovements in the cost and range of battery technology, coupled with growing concern over the emission of both carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides from diesel engines, means that almost the whole automotive industry believes that the mass adoption of electric cars will happen during the next decade.\u201d The survey was taken of 800 executives in 38 countries. People working for vehicle manufacturers, suppliers, dealers, financial and mobility service providers \u2013 as well as car users \u2013 took part in it.",

      "bodyText": "Consumer spending slowed over the Christmasperiod, according to figures that suggest Britons shunned the high street in favour of online shopping and nights out. Spending fell back 2.3% in December from a strong November when Black Friday deals appeared to boost sales, figures from Visa show. That left consumer spending up 2.6% on the year, a slowdown from November\u2019s growth of 3.1%. Visa said the figures still capped off a strong finish to the year, and that taken together the final three months of 2016 marked the best quarterly performance for two years. That follows signs that households have largely shrugged off June\u2019s Brexit vote and continued to spend. A breakdown of the Visa figures underscores the recent trend for people to spend on activities rather than goods. Spending rose year-on-year on hotels, restaurants, bars, recreation and culture. It fell for clothing, footwear and household goods. The figures chime with others showing footfall in shops down after Christmas. Visa\u2019s data shows that online spending rose 5.5% in December, while face-to-face spending was up only 0.7% on the year. That followed a 1.7% fall in face-to-face spending in November. \u201cOnline retailers enjoyed strong sales over the whole Christmas period, while bricks and mortar retailers saw an improvement after a disappointing dip in November, as consumers made a last minute dash for gifts on the high street,\u201d said Kevin Jenkins, Visa\u2019s managing director for the UK and Ireland. \u201cGrowth was once again led by the experience sector, with consumers going to Christmas markets, travelling to visit loved ones or venturing to various parts of the country to celebrate.\u201d Diane Wehrle at the retail analysts Springboard, which tracks shopper numbers, said the number of people visiting British high streets and shopping centres was down slightly over December as a whole, with more significant drops on both of the traditional post-Christmas sales days of Boxing Day and New Year\u2019s Day compared with last year, partly as a result of bad weather on 1 January. \u201cOur retail pound is being spread thinner. People are choosing to go out for a meal rather than buy a sweater,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are buying more online and when they do go out there\u2019s more focus on leisure spend. They might combine click and collect with a coffee or a meal or a visit to the cinema. It\u2019s a more rounded experience.\u201d The consultancy IHS Markit, which compiles Visa\u2019s spending report, joined others in warning of a tougher outlook ahead for retailers and other consumer-facing businesses as prices start to tick higher because the weak pound is making imports more expensive. Annabel Fiddes, an IHS Markit economist, said: \u201cThe UK economy remains in a strong overall position to support expenditure growth into 2017. However, rising inflationary pressures could squeeze spending power, and, along with Brexit-related uncertainty, this could soften the overall growth trajectory of household spending.\u201d There are also worries that the strong run for consumer spending has been driven in part by people taking on more debt. The latest figures from the Bank of England show that unsecured consumer credit, which includes credit cards, car loans and second mortgages, grew at its fastest rate in more than 11 years. New analysis from the TUC found that household debt rose sharply over 2016, with unsecured debt \u2013 that other than mortgages \u2013 reaching new highs. The TUC said weak wage growth had left more families reliant on borrowing to support their living standards, and that unsecured debt per household rose to \u00a312,887 in the third quarter of 2016, a \u00a31,117 increase on a year earlier. Total unsecured debt rose to \u00a3349bn in the third quarter of 2016, a record high and well above the \u00a3290bn peak before the 2008 financial crisis, it said. \u201cThese increases in household debt are a warning that families are struggling to get by on their pay alone,\u201d the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said. \u201cEmployment may have risen, but wages are still worth less today than nine years ago. The government is relying on debt-fuelled consumer spending to support the economy, with investment and trade in the doldrums since the financial crisis.\u201d She said the government could help to protect living standards with decent pay rises for public sector workers, continued rises in the minimum wage to keep pace with inflation and by ensuring that spending on projects such as rail and road improvements targets communities where decent jobs are in short supply.",
