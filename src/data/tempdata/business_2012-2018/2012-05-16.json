    "webTitle": "Greece in crisis: this is not a quarrel in a faraway land | Analysis", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In September 1938, Neville Chamberlain described the growing conflict between Germany and Czechoslovakia as \"a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing\". It would be easy to think much the same about the crisis in Greece, but, be assured, that would be as mistaken as Chamberlain was then. The centre of this crisis \u2013 Athens \u2013 may be 1,500 miles from Britain, but the shockwaves would arrive in the UK pretty swiftly. Britain's huge banking sector will find itself on the frontline if Greek voters reject austerity and the country dives out of the single currency. Many banks have shrewdly slashed their direct exposure to Athens over the past 12 months; but the impact of a \"Grexit\" would be much broader than a drop in the value of Greek bonds. It could hit lending, force up the rates banks charge for finance and make life far more difficult for the exporters so key to recovery. Italy and Spain (countries in which British banks are far more exposed) have struggled to convince the markets they are capable of tackling their debt mountains and it is likely they would come under intense pressure. Their borrowing costs would spike as investors fretted about another country following Greece towards the exit and spiralling bond yields can rapidly turn a tricky budgetary situation into a full-blown fiscal crisis. Bailed-out Portugal and Ireland would also come under renewed pressure. As banks across the continent tried to assess their own and each other's exposure to this kaleidoscope of risks, there would be a severe threat to the entire European financial sector. Britain's financial institutions, owing to their sheer size and heavy international exposure, would find it impossible to escape the collateral damage from a euro meltdown. That would inevitably push up borrowing costs for firms and consumers on this side of the Channel \u2013 including mortgages, for example \u2013 and could even leave some British banks in need of more government help. The second route through which the effects of a Greek departure from the euro would arrive in the UK is via slumping overseas trade. Despite the exhortations of Vince Cable and other ministers for Britain's firms to focus on opening up new markets in Asia and Latin America, Europe still accounts for around half of British exports. Ironically, given that George Osborne has sketched out his position in sharp opposition to his \"feckless\" European colleagues, rising exports to eurozone countries were one of the few bright spots in the UK's dismal economic performance over the past 12 months. But with the eurozone sliding into recession, sales to the worst-hit countries are now in decline. The latest official figures showed an 8% fall in exports to Spain, and a 7% drop to Italy over the three months to March. That effect will only worsen in the coming months, as the economic downturn deepens, driven by political chaos and plunging business and consumer confidence. The effect of declining demand from these struggling economies on the UK is likely to be compounded by a rise in the value of sterling against the euro, as investors flee the troubled single currency and seek the safety of alternatives, including the pound, undermining the efforts of exporters. All this will be hitting an economy that had been flatlining for 18 months, and has now tumbled into the first double-dip recession in decades. While it admits to drawing up contingency plans for the event of a euro collapse, the Bank of England has conspicuously refused to publish estimates of the economic consequences for the UK. However, independent analysts have been less wary of making predictions; and the consensus is that if the euro implodes, the recession will be longer, deeper and more painful than anyone could have predicted. Danny Gabay, of Fathom Consulting, for example, predicts that the impact of a euro breakup on the economy would be \"roughly half as bad again\" as the collapse of Lehman Brothers.",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron will issue his starkest warning yet on the plight of the euro on Thursday, saying unless urgent action is taken there will be a breakup, adding he will do whatever possible to keep Britain safe in perilous times. Cameron's stark message comes only a day after the chancellor, George Osborne, had said open speculation about the eurozone was itself damaging the European economy. Cameron and Osborne now believe that with the failure of the Greeks to form a government, a direct warning has to be given to the eurozone leaders about the scale of the threat, and the need for urgent action. Treasury sources say they have been arguing for the introduction of eurobonds for a year, as well as a looser monetary policy: \"Without that, Germany is simply asking too much of the periphery countries who do not have the benefit of our independent monetary policy and flexible exchange rate.\" Cameron will underline the message at meetings with Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the new French president, and the German chancellor Angela Merkel at a G8 summit in Washington this weekend. In a speech in Manchester before flying to the US, he will say: \"Either Europe has a committed, stable, successful eurozone with an effective firewall, well capitalised and regulated banks, a system of fiscal burden sharing, and supportive monetary policy across the eurozone, or we are in uncharted territory which carries huge risks for everybody. \"But be in no doubt: whichever path is chosen, I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to protect this country and secure our economy and financial system.\" Alistair Darling, former chancellor and the man who helped stop a run on the British banks in 2008, said the crisis in Greece was now reminiscent of the run on Northern Rock, and that would look small beer in comparison with a Europe-wide crisis. \"The banks in too many parts of Europe were not cleared out in the way we and the Americans did in 2008 \u2013 so when you get all this turbulence it just adds to a lethal cocktail.\" Sounding exasperated and deeply worried about the unfolding crisis, Darling said: \"The clear message that is being sent is surely now [that] they need to start thinking of a solution that is actually going to work, more than people expect.\" \"The big risk is when the money comes out [and] the banks don't actually physically have the stuff to hand over, you get cash machines going off, the doors closing and you do get blind panic.\" He described the fiscal pact signed by EU member states as madness, since \"it locks countries on the edge into a downward spiral like the Treaty of Versailles at the end of the first world war with the result that their economies shrink and the debts go up.

      "bodyText": "Unemployment declined by 45,000 in the three months to March, raising hopes that Britain's recession-hit economy is on the mend. The total number of jobless fell to 2.63 million, according to the Office for National Statistics, its lowest level since last summer. That brought the unemployment rate in the first quarter of 2012 down to 8.2%, from 8.4% in the last three months of 2011. Employment minister Chris Grayling seized on the news as a \"step in the right direction\". The ONS said the more timely claimant count, which measures the number of people receiving jobseeker's allowance, had also fallen, by 13,700 in April, to 1.59 million. The news was welcomed by the coalition, which has faced sharp criticism over its handling of the economy since it was confirmed that the UK has slipped into a double-dip recession. \"I know I never place too much store on a single month's figures because these numbers go up and down and we are clearly living in difficult times economically, but any improvement in the labour market is very welcome,\" Grayling said. However, there were still clear signs of strains in the labour market, with the number of people working part-time because they are unable to find a full-time role hitting a record high of 1.4 million. Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, said: \"That there are 2.63 million people without jobs shows the extent to which the government's gamble with the economy has failed. So instead of borrowing to support the economy and to continue the recovery the government has had to borrow to fund the recession.\" The squeeze on household spending power has also continued for those who have managed to stay in work, with average pay excluding bonuses increasing at an annual rate of 2% \u2013 much weaker than the 3.5% rate of inflation. The ONS said that bonuses had been lower in the first three months of 2012 than last year, \"particularly within the finance and business services and manufacturing sectors,\" pushing annual pay growth across the economy including bonuses to just 0.6%. Youth unemployment also declined, according to the ONS: there were 1.02 million 16 to 24-year-olds looking for work in the three months to March, down by 17,000 on the previous quarter. However, the unemployment rate for this age group was still 21.9%, more than two-and-a-half times higher than for the workforce as a whole. Alan Clarke, of Scotia Capital, said the improvement in the jobs numbers pointed to a strengthening in the overall economic outlook. \"The labour data suggests that the recovery is ticking over quite nicely, though it would be foolhardy to get complacent given that the risks facing the economy are skewed to the downside.\"",

However In view of this week's statement from Plus Markets, the company is working with its corporate advisers to consider all the options available, and hopes to inform shareholders of its decision before the annual meeting at the end of June.",

      "bodyText": "London-listed oil rig builder, Lamprell, has issued a profit warning just a fortnight after two of its senior executives sold a substantial number of shares in the business. More than \u00a3500m was wiped off the value of Lamprell on Wednesday morning when the group put out a statement saying it had run into equipment problems on some of the rigs. The company, which operates fabrication yards in the Middle East, blamed a failure by suppliers plus cost-overruns on two innovative wind turbine installation vessels for driving the business into the red. \"It is anticipated that the delay in revenue generation together with the additional costs will result in the group incurring a small loss in the first half of the year with a recovery expected in the second half,\" it explained. The announcement wiped 64% off the share price to 106p and made Lamprell the worst performing share in the FTSE 250 index. The loss for the period ending 30 June compares with a profit of $18.6m (\u00a311.68m) during the same period last year and contrasts with its own upbeat assessment of its fortunes just six weeks ago. But the announcement was particularly embarrassing because two directors of the company, Kevin Isles and Scott Doak, offloaded a substantial number of shares at the start of the month. The incident is likely to attract the interest of the Financial Services Authority and Lamprell was forced to defend the sales when it took calls from City analysts. A company spokesman told the Guardian that neither of the two men were on the board of the company nor were privy to price sensitive information at that point. \"The share sales were completed entirely properly and in accordance with all stock exchange rules,\" he said. Lamprell argued it was largely a victim of the high oil price which has led to a drilling boom all around the world and a rush by rig operators to build new vessels. This in turn has led to shortages of equipment forcing Lamprell to keep some of its 11,000 workers idle while it waits for new product supplies to turn up. But there are also \"further costs\" connected with the construction of the Windcarrier Brave Tern and the Seajacks Zaratan, to rigs that help install wind turbines. Lamprell said these are highly complex pieces of equipment for a new industry that is growing up in the North Sea and elsewhere as governments pursue low-carbon energy schemes. German engineering group, Siemens, recently slashed its full-year profit outlook late last month after incurring another major charge related to delayed offshore wind power projects. Vestas, the world's largest wind-turbine manufacturer, has been hit by a series of profit warnings and shipment delays leading to a major exit of members of the board earlier this year. Keith Morris, an oil analyst with Investec Securities, pointed out that Lamprell had also warned of cost overruns on some of its contracts last October. \"The trouble is that a reputation is hard to gain in the City and easy to lose.\" David Round, analyst with Oriel Securities, agreed: \"Despite the recent contract awards adding to an already strong order book, today's announcement creates a lot of uncertainty.\"",

      "bodyText": "The ructions over pay at Barclays continue to fascinate. Alison Carnwath, the new head of the bank's pay committee, thought chief executive Bob Diamond should surrender his \u00a32.7m bonus, according to the Wall Street Journal. Chairman Marcus Agius resisted, the tale goes, and a fudge was agreed to placate shareholders by which Diamond and finance director Chris Lucas agreed to tie half their bonuses to three-year performance targets. These details are intriguing because there are two schools of thought on Carnwath, as noted here a couple of weeks ago. One City grandee who has served on boards with her in the past says she's tougher than your average non-executive director on pay issues; he thinks it was a poor show for 21% of votes to be cast against her re-election at Barclays. The other view says she's no match for the Agius/Diamond axis. Both camps might claim the latest details support its case. On one hand, Carnwath wanted to see Diamond be given less after a year in which returns on capital fell. On the other hand, she didn't get far - the eventual compromise was watery. One suspects this little sub-plot has some distance to run. For example: the 31% of Barclays shareholders who didn't approve of the pay report now have a specific question to put to Agius as he does the rounds to try to dampen ill-feeling: was the board divided over Diamond's bonus and did he, as chairman, disagree with Carnwath? As for Carnwath, the view from here still stands: if she felt undermined, the option of resignation is always open. Yes, collective responsibility reigns in boardrooms for good reasons and compromises are part of the game - but there are limits.",

      "bodyText": "It's been a while since Sir Mervyn King used a footballing analogy to flavour his opening remarks at the Bank of England's inflation report press conference, but the Aston Villa-supporting governor was back on form today. Uncertainty, he said, could sometimes add to the spice of life, as with the conclusion to the Premier League last Sunday, but it had the opposite effect on the economy. The risks associated with the crisis in the eurozone are making it tougher for the monetary policy committee to chart the right course for the economy. King did not elaborate on which Premier League football team the UK resembled. Certainly not Manchester City, given that output is still 4% below where it was when the recession began in 2008 and is not projected to reach its previous peak until 2014. That's serious relegation form. What's more, the recent results of Threadneedle Street FC have not been mightily impressive. As usual, King had to admit that growth had turned out to be lower than expected three months ago while inflation was higher. It will now be the middle of next year before the annual increase in the cost of living comes back down to the government's 2% target. Interest rates have been pegged at 0.5% for more than three years and \u00a3325bn has been pumped into the economy through quantitative easing, but the economy has flatlined for the past five quarters. Like any Premier League manager who has spent big without any marked improvement in results, the governor can trot out a whole host of reasons for the Bank's poor forecasting record and its inability to hit the inflation target. Higher VAT, the depreciation in sterling, rising commodity prices, the fact that the euro is \u2013 as the governor so vividly put it \u2013 \"tearing itself apart\": all these have made it unrealistic to expect the MPC to keep growth close to its long-term average and inflation at 2%. There's something in this, of course. King is managing an economy which, like his beloved Villa, has seen much better days. The economy has deep structural weaknesses and has been through a colossal banking crisis that has caused the deepest recession since the 1930s. The slow-motion disintegration of the euro means there is no obvious reason why Britain should go leaping up the growth league table. Yet, in some ways, King should count himself lucky. Very few owners of Premier League football clubs would be willing to accept such a poor run of results. That includes Villa, who sacked their manager within 24 hours of the season ending.",

King is managing an economy which, like his beloved Villa, has seen much better days. The economy has deep structural weaknesses and has been through a colossal banking crisis that has caused the deepest recession since the 1930s. The slow-motion disintegration of the euro means there is no obvious reason why Britain should go leaping up the growth league table.</p> <p>Yet, in some ways, King should count himself lucky. Very few owners of Premier League football clubs would be willing to accept such a poor run of results. That includes Villa, who sacked their manager within 24 hours of the season ending.</p>",
