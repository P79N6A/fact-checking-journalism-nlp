Ma, who was an English teacher before founding the company which floated in New York this year, had his wealth valued at $25.9bn, up $22.3bn since December 2013. He ranks 49th in the index which is led by Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who holds the top spot ahead of Mexican businessman Carlos Slim who made his fortune in telecoms and whom Forbes has previously ranked as the world\u2019s richest man. Tech industry billionaires in the list added $52.9bn to their fortunes, Bloomberg said, more than those in any other industry. Warren Buffett, the legendary investor, moved up one spot to third and is one of the 42 Americans in the ranking. There are nine from Russia although the magazine calculates they have lost $11bn from their combined wealth as result of western sanctions. There is only one Briton on the list \u2013 the Duke of Westminster, the landowner. Measured in dollars, the biggest loser is Ingvar Kamprad, the founder of Ikea. He has lost $10.1bn since last December, mainly due to assets being moved over to his son. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 November 2014. An earlier version said that, measured in dollars, the biggest loser was Dieter Schwarz, the boss of Lidl, who has lost $5.9bn since last December.",

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>As international oil companies begin to restart full operations in Iraq despite the continuing threat of attacks by Islamic State (Isis), one lifelong oil worker has spoken about what it is like to be regularly flown in to some of the world\u2019s most dangerous places.</p> <p>\u201cOn a Sunday I can be weeding carrots, and the next thing you know I\u2019m sitting in a car in some remote part of the world with a guy sitting next to me carrying a Kalashnikov,\u201d said Richard, speaking by Skype from a militarised compound near Zakho in northern Iraq, 10 miles from the Turkish border.</p> <p>London-based oil exploration companies Afren, Genel Energy and Gulf Keystone Petroleum \u2013 which had evacuated staff from Kurdistan in August due to the threat from Isis \u2013 have returned staff and are either back to full operation or expect to be soon.</p> <p>Afren, a FTSE 250 oil exploration company, last month returned international staff to its Barda Rash oilfield near Erbil after evacuating on 8 August. The company, which recently fired its chief executive for gross misconduct, said employee safety was its first consideration: \u201cThe decision to resume full operations at Barda Rash has been made following a close monitoring of the situation and in close consultation with the relevant authorities.\u201d</p> <p>Richard, who is in his 60s and declined to give his surname, has spent most of his career in some of the world\u2019s most dangerous places since joining the oil industry at the age of 18.</p> <p>\u201cI have had some pretty horrendous experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is what I do. I don\u2019t consider working in this area more dangerous than the journeys I was making for work between Aberdeen and Dundee \u2013 you are still increasing your chances of being wiped out. Here I don\u2019t drive; there are risks I\u2019m not exposed to. It is about different types of risks.\u201d</p> <p>Richard\u2019s employer, a small European oil explorer which he declined to name, bans all staff from driving in Kurdistan, and if they are sent out of the compound they always have an armed escort.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not only travelling with armed escorts in the car but armed escorts in other cars. You\u2019re told to keep your head down and there are flak jackets at your knees.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an expat with a military background who arranges guards and security support,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re well-briefed about what to do in all circumstances. [But] they don\u2019t show you how to shoot somebody.\u201d</p> <p>The oilfield is patrolled by the mostly Kurdish military-style Oilfield Protection Force, who are armed with Kalashnikovs and 9mm pistols and in full battle dress. \u201cThere is only one main access into the field with three security checkpoints, and inside we create our own roads and you\u2019ll pass a sentry point every two to three kilometres.\u201d</p> <p>Are the guards kept busy? \u201cNot at all. It must be very boring.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s quite a boring life for Richard and his colleagues as well. Officially, he works from 6am to 8pm but says he normally puts in many more hours because there\u2019s not much else to do. \u201cThere\u2019s very little in terms of recreation. You\u2019ve got a TV in your room and there\u2019s a small gym, and maybe you can go for a run around the perimeter. But that\u2019s about it.\u201d</p> <p>His room is 3 meters by 4 meters in a cabin split into three bedrooms. A cabin next door is his office, another is the staff canteen. The food, he says, is \u201ccrap\u201d. \u201cYou get some nice hummus and bread, but it\u2019s pretty repetitive. My daily diet consists of muesli and bananas for breakfast, maybe some soup or bread for lunch. It\u2019s boring, but that\u2019s just part of the job.\u201d</p> <p>The boredom, the risks and close working conditions help colleagues form \u201cmuch deeper relationships\u201d than in regular office jobs. \u201cEveryone develops lifelong pals,\u201d he says. His current colleagues are six Englishmen, four Scots and a couple of Americans.</p> <p>While working in Kurdistan is boring, he says it is nothing compared with a previous posting in the middle of the Sahara desert in Algeria. \u201cIn terms of boredom and total lack of social interaction, Algeria was the place simply because you were so restricted to the confines of the operation facility,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tended to be flown from one spot, into the desert, flown back and flown to London. I don\u2019t think I spent any cash when I was in Algeria, and I was there for three years.\u201d</p> <p>In Kurdistan, Richard has occasionally ventured out to Zakho or Erbil, and says a lot of the locals are people who had fled to the UK after the fall of Saddam Hussein but are \u201cvery patriotic and have chosen to come back here, probably to a much lesser lifestyle\u201d.</p> <p>Richard, who has also previously worked in Russia, Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi, gets paid danger money. \u201cThe closer to the hot spot you are, the more you tend to get,\u201d is all he will say, until he is asked if his salary is around \u00a3120,000 a year. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, aren\u2019t you? Would you come out here for \u00a3120k a year? My income ranges from marginally below that to more than double.\u201d</p> <p>The real advantage, he says, is the working pattern: generally five weeks on, four weeks off.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good enough cash, but I could make the same in Aberdeen. It\u2019s the type of work you enjoy doing \u2026 Working in a remote location, managing to get something up, built and operational.

      "bodyText": "As international oil companies begin to restart full operations in Iraq despite the continuing threat of attacks by Islamic State (Isis), one lifelong oil worker has spoken about what it is like to be regularly flown in to some of the world\u2019s most dangerous places. \u201cOn a Sunday I can be weeding carrots, and the next thing you know I\u2019m sitting in a car in some remote part of the world with a guy sitting next to me carrying a Kalashnikov,\u201d said Richard, speaking by Skype from a militarised compound near Zakho in northern Iraq, 10 miles from the Turkish border. London-based oil exploration companies Afren, Genel Energy and Gulf Keystone Petroleum \u2013 which had evacuated staff from Kurdistan in August due to the threat from Isis \u2013 have returned staff and are either back to full operation or expect to be soon. Afren, a FTSE 250 oil exploration company, last month returned international staff to its Barda Rash oilfield near Erbil after evacuating on 8 August. The company, which recently fired its chief executive for gross misconduct, said employee safety was its first consideration: \u201cThe decision to resume full operations at Barda Rash has been made following a close monitoring of the situation and in close consultation with the relevant authorities.\u201d Richard, who is in his 60s and declined to give his surname, has spent most of his career in some of the world\u2019s most dangerous places since joining the oil industry at the age of 18. \u201cI have had some pretty horrendous experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is what I do. I don\u2019t consider working in this area more dangerous than the journeys I was making for work between Aberdeen and Dundee \u2013 you are still increasing your chances of being wiped out. Here I don\u2019t drive; there are risks I\u2019m not exposed to. It is about different types of risks.\u201d Richard\u2019s employer, a small European oil explorer which he declined to name, bans all staff from driving in Kurdistan, and if they are sent out of the compound they always have an armed escort. \u201cYou\u2019re not only travelling with armed escorts in the car but armed escorts in other cars. You\u2019re told to keep your head down and there are flak jackets at your knees. \u201cThere is an expat with a military background who arranges guards and security support,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re well-briefed about what to do in all circumstances. [But] they don\u2019t show you how to shoot somebody.\u201d The oilfield is patrolled by the mostly Kurdish military-style Oilfield Protection Force, who are armed with Kalashnikovs and 9mm pistols and in full battle dress. \u201cThere is only one main access into the field with three security checkpoints, and inside we create our own roads and you\u2019ll pass a sentry point every two to three kilometres.\u201d Are the guards kept busy? \u201cNot at all. It must be very boring.\u201d It\u2019s quite a boring life for Richard and his colleagues as well. Officially, he works from 6am to 8pm but says he normally puts in many more hours because there\u2019s not much else to do. \u201cThere\u2019s very little in terms of recreation. You\u2019ve got a TV in your room and there\u2019s a small gym, and maybe you can go for a run around the perimeter. But that\u2019s about it.\u201d His room is 3 meters by 4 meters in a cabin split into three bedrooms. A cabin next door is his office, another is the staff canteen. The food, he says, is \u201ccrap\u201d. \u201cYou get some nice hummus and bread, but it\u2019s pretty repetitive. My daily diet consists of muesli and bananas for breakfast, maybe some soup or bread for lunch. It\u2019s boring, but that\u2019s just part of the job.\u201d The boredom, the risks and close working conditions help colleagues form \u201cmuch deeper relationships\u201d than in regular office jobs. \u201cEveryone develops lifelong pals,\u201d he says. His current colleagues are six Englishmen, four Scots and a couple of Americans. While working in Kurdistan is boring, he says it is nothing compared with a previous posting in the middle of the Sahara desert in Algeria. \u201cIn terms of boredom and total lack of social interaction, Algeria was the place simply because you were so restricted to the confines of the operation facility,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tended to be flown from one spot, into the desert, flown back and flown to London. I don\u2019t think I spent any cash when I was in Algeria, and I was there for three years.\u201d In Kurdistan, Richard has occasionally ventured out to Zakho or Erbil, and says a lot of the locals are people who had fled to the UK after the fall of Saddam Hussein but are \u201cvery patriotic and have chosen to come back here, probably to a much lesser lifestyle\u201d. Richard, who has also previously worked in Russia, Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi, gets paid danger money. \u201cThe closer to the hot spot you are, the more you tend to get,\u201d is all he will say, until he is asked if his salary is around \u00a3120,000 a year. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, aren\u2019t you? Would you come out here for \u00a3120k a year? My income ranges from marginally below that to more than double.\u201d The real advantage, he says, is the working pattern: generally five weeks on, four weeks off. \u201cIt\u2019s good enough cash, but I could make the same in Aberdeen. It\u2019s the type of work you enjoy doing \u2026 Working in a remote location, managing to get something up, built and operational. The challenges bring the rewards.\u201d Richard says he spends his money on \u201cbuying my wife nice things\u201d, and he drives a Porsche, but the couple still live in a \u201csmall semi-detached\u201d in Aberdeen. Iraq exports hit record Iraq is already the second-biggest oil producer in Opec, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and analysts expect it to be the world\u2019s fastest growing producer in the coming years. Philippe Dauba-Pantanacce, a senior economist at Standard Chartered, said Iraq had the world\u2019s largest oil reserves because production had been held up by war and sanctions. \u201cNot only do they have a humongous oil reserve, the geology is very favourable [which allows it to be extracted] very much more cheaply,\u201d he said on Bloomberg TV. \u201cHalf the world\u2019s incremental oil production will come from Iraq.\u201d Dauba-Pantanacce said Iraqi oil production would be worth $5tn (\u00a33tn) by 2035. In 2010 Iraq said its proven oil reserves had increased to 143bn barrels from the previous estimate of 115bn. Despite continuing violence in the north of the country, Iraq\u2019s October oil exports are expected to have hit a record. Daily exports from Iraq\u2019s southern terminals have averaged 2.55m barrels per day (bpd), according to shipping data. In May exports hit 2.58m bpd, the highest since at least 2003. Most of the active oilfields are in the relatively peaceful south of the country. Kurdistan\u2019s oilfields are much less developed, but exports averaged 180,000 bpd in September according to the International Energy Agency. Islamic State militants who seized some oilfields in northern Iraq and Syria had been producing about 50,000-60,000 bpd before US-led air strikes, according to IHS analysts\u2019 estimates. IHS said IS may have made up to $2m selling the oil on the black market at $25-$60 a barrel, far below the benchmark Brent crude price of $83.",

      "bodyText": "Cuts to the European Commission\u2019s growth forecasts, a rise in the US trade deficit and the supposed spats at the ECB have all combined to send shares lower again. So despite the Japanese market hitting a seven year high overnight, investors ended up in cautious mood once more. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 34 points or 0.52% at 6453.97 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.92% to 9166.47 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.52% lower at 4130.19 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 2.24% to 18,934.63 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.12% at 10,154.4 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 13 points or 0.08% lower. And on that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece, senior officials are admitting that far from being erased, corruption - widely seen as the root cause of the nation\u2019s lack of competitiveness - is still rampant. Helena Smith reports from Athens: It was the affliction that, more than any, was meant to have been eradicated with the enforcement of reforms demanded in return for bailout funds. But attending the opening of new offices for the country\u2019s recently appointed anti-corruption czar today, the deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos announced that the scourge was not only alive, it was still pervasive at the highest echelons of power in Greece. \u201cThere is corruption, organized and extensive [corruption] \u2026. which resides in power, in the public administration and the state sector, and the private sector,\u201d he admitted adding that the creation of a post dedicated to crushing the practice was a landmark event. \u201cIt will be a new, exceptionally ambitious and, I want to hope, effective institution that is further confirmation of of our faith in the campaign against corruption.\u201d Greece\u2019s troika of creditors had hoped that the scourge \u2013 widely blamed for holding the country back and deterring international investors \u2013 would be effectively tackled as Athens overhauled its economic system. Instead, new rules appear to have only incited Greeks to have come up with new ways to circumvent them - even newly appointed tax officials are now on the take. The lack of punishment meted out to crooked officials (only one government minister has been imprisoned for accepting kickbacks) is believed to have played a major role in keeping the practice alive. And some commentary on the supposed Draghi disputes. Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX said: While we weren\u2019t expecting a Fed-styled, sovereign QE program from the ECB this week, the rumours emerging today are nothing short of astounding. Reports have surfaced that ECB President Mario Draghi faces a small scale mutiny, with many national central banks feeling that they\u2019ve been left out of the loop for determining monetary policy. This is important because there could be up to 10 policymakers (of the 24 reps) that would vote against a sovereign QE. Even as recent economic data has slowed its rate of erosion, the spectre of additional stimulus from the ECB has remained as a heavy burden for the euro. Traders have piled into euro short positions in recent weeks, and now there is the second largest short position among speculators since July 2012 \u2013 the week before euro/dollar bottomed at $1.2041. If a Fed-styled QE program is now seen as even more unlikely given president Draghi\u2019s recently revealed unpopularity, we must not discount the potential of a euro short covering rally around the ECB rate decision on Thursday and the US non-farm payrolls report on Friday. More from the Reuters story on Mario Draghi, and there is some interesting colour in the tale: At times, Draghi has appeared to pay little attention to national governors\u2019 comments in the monthly rate-setting meeting after chief economist Peter Praet and board member Benoit Coeure report on the economic situation and financial markets. \u201cHe sits there with these three mobile phones in front of him and sometimes he\u2019s sending text messages or going out to make or take phone calls,\u201d one source usually in the room said. On at least one occasion, a national governor has skipped his turn to speak because Draghi was not present. \u201cThis has got a bit better. He\u2019s paying a bit more attention now,\u201d the source said. And apparently German chancellor Angela Merkel tried to mend bridges between Draghi and Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann. Their relations hit a low point in October after the German publicly criticised ECB policy, but Merkel privately urged both to mend their relationship: After her intervention, Draghi and Weidmann met last week to try to clear the air but they did not resolve all their policy differences, the source said. Merkel\u2019s office declined comment on her reported meeting with Draghi, and neither the ECB nor the Bundesbank would comment on whether Draghi and Weidmann met last week. Ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting this week, there are reports of disagreements between some members and ECB president Mario Draghi. It had been widely suggested that Germany was not keen on some of Draghi\u2019s proposals for stimulus measures to boost the flagging eurozone economy. But now Reuters writes: National central bankers in the euro area plan to challenge European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi on Wednesday over what they see as his secretive management style and erratic communication and will urge him to act more collegially, ECB sources said. The bankers are particularly angered that Draghi effectively set a target for increasing the ECB\u2019s balance sheet immediately after the policy-making governing council explicitly agreed not to make any figure public, the sources said. \u201cThis created exactly the expectations we wanted to avoid,\u201d an ECB insider said. \u201cNow everything we do is measured against the aim of increasing the balance sheet by a trillion (euros)... He created a rod for our own backs.\u201d Irritation among national governors who hold a majority on the 24-member council could limit Draghi\u2019s space for bolder policy action in the coming months as the bank faces crucial choices about whether to buy sovereign bonds to combat falling inflation and economic stagnation. Some members intend to raise their concerns with Draghi at the governors\u2019 traditional informal working dinner on Wednesday before their formal monthly rate-setting meeting on Thursday, the sources interviewed by Reuters said. The ECB declined comment on the matter. And to catch up some earlier news, Chinese e-commerce business Alibaba has reported a better than expected 54% rise in revenues for the three months to the end of September. The company, which floated in September and is now worth more than Facebook at nearly $250bn, said net profit grew 16% to $1.1bn. But after a rise in share based compensation costs, profits fell 39% to $494m. Nor would the company give guidance for future earnings. Alibaba\u2019s shares have added around 2.5% following the figures, its first since the flotation. In the corporate world, Rolls-Royce has just announced 2,600 job cuts and the departure of its finance director. My colleague Rupert Neate writes: Rolls-Royce has announced it is cutting 2,600 jobs \u2013 mostly in its aerospace division \u2013 within the next 18 months as well as the sudden departure of its finance director. The company, which employs 24,800 workers in Britain out of 55,200 worldwide, said technological changes had enabled it to \u201cincrease output and improve efficiency\u201d. The job cuts come three weeks after the company issued a major profit warning, which wiped \u00a32bn off its market value. The company said that finance director Mark Morris had decided to leave the company after 27 years. Full story here: Rolls-Royce to axe 2,600 jobs Back with the US trade figures, and overseas weakness rather than dollar strength is more likely to be responsible for the dip in exports, said Rob Carnell at ING Bank. He said: The US trade deficit slipped back a bit wider in September \u2013 following months where the trend has been for narrowing. This was not a petroleum story - the ex-petroleum deficit widened from $26.863bn to $29.028bn, more or less the same move as the total deficit ($39.991bn in August out to $43.032bn in September). This could strip off 0.2 percentage points from the 3.5% advance third quarter GDP release, assuming no offsetting moves from other aspects of the GDP release. The wider deficit was mainly the result of weak exports, not strong imports, and most of this occurred on the goods side, not services. It is possible that the dollar\u2019s strength has already begun to weigh on exports, but in our view, overseas economic weakness is a far more plausible explanation for the export dip. This back-step in the trade data may take the shine off the dollar for a short while, though the underlying story for dollar strength remains intact, and is likely to be bolstered by data out later in the week, including, importantly, non-farm payrolls on Friday. Time for a round-up. The European Commission has warned that the eurozone economy is struggling to grow, after slashing its GDP forecasts over the next two years. In its autumn forecasts, the EC now expects growth of just 0.8% this year (down from 1.2%), rising to just 1.1% in 2015 (down from 1.7%). Marco Buti, director general of Economic and Financial Affairs, warned: In the second half of this year, GDP growth in the EU is set to be very modest, while in the euro area it will almost stagnate. Buti warned that Europe\u2019s big four economies all face serious problems: Among the largest euro area Member States, we see growth increasing in Spain where unemployment remains very high, growth coming to a stop in Germany after a very strong first quarter, protracted stagnation in France, and contraction in Italy. The full report is online here (pdf) And this map shows how many countries will struggle to grow this year: Italy is now expected to contract by 0.4% this year, down from 0.6% growth expected six months ago. Germany\u2019s growth forecast for 2014 was slashed to 1.3%, from 1.8%. And next year\u2019s growth has been almost halved, from 2% to 1.1%. It\u2019s a grim picture in France too -- where the commission sees growth of just 0.3% this year (from 1%), rising to just 0.7%, from 1.5%. But Ireland is expected to shine, with growth of 4.6% this year. The UK\u2019s GDP is tipped to grow by 3.1%. The EC also warned that the region\u2019s jobless crisis remains intense, with little progress expected over the next two years: Commissioner Jyrki Katainen admitted that: The economic and employment situation is not improving fast enough. He told a press conference in Brussels that he could see a gradual recovery on the horizon, and blamed financial markets for fuelling the eurozone crisis by recklessly lending to some countries (highlights start here). As the forecasts were released, chancellor Angela Merkel was warning that the eurozone is not fixed. She told a meeting in Berlin that: \u201cThe situation in the euro zone remains extremely fragile.\u201d But Merkel also hit out at pressure to spend and borrow more, declaring: We want to stick to the Stability and Growth Pact. This is also about growth and that is why we must reject a debate about austerity against growth. This is mistaken and takes us no further.\u201d In other news.... Growth in the UK construction sector has hit a five-month low, but remains quite strong - with workers managing to push up their pay. The US trade gap has widened unexpectedly. Hugo Boss has hit investors with a profits warning. Japan\u2019s Nikkei has hit a seven-year high, as investors applauded the Bank of Japan\u2019s new stimulus programme And a video clip showing CNBC presenter astounded to hear that Ireland uses the euro is worth watching.... Over in Dublin\u2019, \u201cDesperate Housewives\u2019 actress Eva Longoria has declined to endorse Hilary Clinton as the Democrats next Presidential candidate. Henry McDonald explains: Longoria was one of the star speakers at today\u2019s Web Summit in Dublin where she shared a stage with Jemima Khan. Khan asked if her if she would back Hilary Clinton for the presidency given that she had supported her husband and then President Obama. \u201cIt\u2019s far too early, I am supporting the President now,\u201d Enda Kenny has also appeared on CNBC, and claimed that the closure of the notorious double-Irish tax loophole* in 2020 won\u2019t hurt the economy. * - It allows companies to base themselves in Ireland, and then also move much taxable revenue to an Irish-registered firm operating in a tax haven Back in Dublin, prime minister Enda Kenny has arrived at the Web Summit and will be (remotely) ringing the opening bell of the Nasdaq exchange later. Just in... the US trade deficit has widened unexpectedly after exports fell to a five-month low. The gap between what America imports and exports jumped by 7% in September to $43.03bn. It was due to a wide-ranging dip in shipments of goods and services overseas. Exports to the European Union fell by 6.5% in September, while those to China dropped by 3.2%. Exports to Japan tumbled almost 15%. Imports were unchanged. The data suggests America is suffering from the weakness of the global economy. The strong dollar (which hit a four-year high this week) will also be weighing on exports. German chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that the eurozone remains a fragile place, but continues to resist pressure to spend more to encourage growth. Speaking at the German Employers\u2019 Conference in Berlin, Merkel said progress has been made since the height of the crisis, as Ireland, Portugal, and Greece had completed or were close to exiting their bailout programmes. However, she added that: \u201cThe situation in the euro zone remains extremely fragile.\u201d And insisted that structural reforms needed to be implemented in some countries. Merkel also hit back at claims that Germany should abandon its plan of a balanced budget, even though it is now on the brink of recession. She said: \u201cInvestment is needed but not with new borrowing,\u201d \u201c[The goal of a balanced budget] is seen as excessive saving. But in light of the demographic challenges in Germany, it\u2019s ... simply sensible behaviour.\u201d Nicholas Ebisch, currency analyst at Caxton FX, says the EC has now recognised that its economic growth situation is worsening -- something investors realised some time ago.... This news today has not affected the currency markets much, as euro weakness has already been priced into the market. The dovish rhetoric from the ECB over the last month or two has lowered expectations for the Eurozone, so this news of a downgrade have not lead to significant selling. On a lighter note..... there are red faces at CNBC today after their business show anchor, Joe Kernen, was baffled to learn that Ireland uses the euro. In a toe-curling exchange (scroll forwards to the seven minute mark), Kernen appears genuinely amazed that Ireland isn\u2019t using the pound. After all, it\u2019s good enough for the Scottish. IDA Ireland chief executive Martin Shanahan does his best, as this transcript from the Irish Times shows: CNBC: What has the weaker euro meant in terms of tourism? Shanahan: So, I think, em, Ireland is a very globalised economy so we look to what is happening here as much as we do to what is happening in Europe and we look to what is happening in... CNBC: You have pounds anyway don\u2019t you still? Shanahan: We have Euros. CNBC: You have Euros in Ireland? Shanahan: Yes. We have euros, which is eh... CNBC: Why do you have euros in Ireland? Shanahan: A strong recovery.... CNBC: Why do use euros in Ireland? Shanhan: Why wouldn\u2019t we have euros in Ireland? CNBC: Huh. I\u2019d use the pound. Shanahan: We use euro. CNBC: What about Scotland? I was using Scottish eh... Shanahan: Scottish pounds. CNBC: Scottish pounds. Shanahan: They use Sterling. CNBC: They use sterling? Shanahan: They use sterling. But we use euro. CNBC: What? Why would you do that? Shanahan: Why wouldn\u2019t we do that. CNBC: Why didn\u2019t Scotland? No wander they wanted to break away. Shanahan: They are part of the UK we are not. CNBC: Aren\u2019t you right next to er? Shanahan: We are very close but entirely separate. CNBC: It is sort of the same, same island isn\u2019t it? Shanhan: And in the North of Ireland they have sterling. CNBC: They do? Shanhan: And in the North of Ireland they use sterling. CNBC: It is just too confusing...  If only the euro had been, er, you know, in the news recently.... Jubilation that Ireland will be the fastest growing member of the EU this year was tempered by an embarrassing glitch on day one of the Web Summit in Dublin\u2019s RDS conference centre (preview here) Henry McDonald reports that: The event\u2019s free wi fi system is not up to speed and many participants are complaining they cannot get on line. Web Summit founder co-founder Paddy Cosgrove admits \u201cit\u2019s incredibly disappointing\u201d and has put the blame on the RDS for the wi fi breakdown. On a brighter and bigger note there will be some relief in Government buildings in Dublin over the news from Brussels this morning regarding Ireland\u2019s growth prospects. The EU has predicted Irish growth will be the highest in Europe this year at 4.6%, which will come as some relief to Enda Kenny (due to attend the Web Summit tomorrow) and his ministers after the battering they have been taking lately over the imposition of water charges. Today\u2019s EC Autumn Forecast is quite gloomy about Germany, whose growth forecast in 2015 has been almost halved, from 2% to 1.1%. The EC is concerned that private investment has slowed - one reason that growth went into reverse this spring. The EC says: \u201cGeopolitical tension and concerns about economic developments in important trading partners may have triggered a wait-and-see attitude among firms,\u201d \u201cHowever, as domestic and external demand pick up, geopolitical and other external uncertainty decreases and favourable financing conditions hold, corporate investment should resume its recovery in 2015.\u201d The European Commission\u2019s new Autumn Forecasts are online here - and there\u2019s even a Vine to accompany them..... Is Europe\u2019s \u20ac300bn investment plan really big enough to stimulate growth in the region? Commissioner Katainen says that politicians must ask why private firms are not prepared to invest in Europe -- reforming their economies might make them more attractive. I won\u2019t say that this \u20ac300bn plan it will change the world, Katainen adds, but it is part of the story. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Another fine question -- what lessons can we learn from the fact that Finland, one of the main supporters of eurozone austerity, is now expected to grow very slowly next year? Katainen (Finland\u2019s prime minister during the crisis) defends the decisions of the past. Looking back a few years - who would have lent money to the countries at risk if they had not committed to reducing their borrowing? Those who say the budget consolidation was wrong -- who do they think would have lent to those countries? Today, though, Europe\u2019s overall budget plans are broadly balanced, he argues. How can we trust these new forecasts, given the previous ones were wrong? Excellent question. Commissioner Katainen looks slightly irked about having to defend the forecasts of his predecessors, but he insists that they are drawn up by experts. And these new projections are \u201cmore or less in line\u201d with forecasts from the OECD and the IMF. But still, all these forecast have been \u201cmore or less wrong\u201d in the past, he concedes. Nobody really knows if these new ones are any better. It is up to us and member states to make changes to these forecasts, hopefully positive ones, he adds. Moscovici is a bit kinder to the Brussels\u2019 numbercrunchers - saying he thinks these forecasts are accurate. Pierre Moscovici says he is planning to visit Greece soon, probably before the next meeting of eurozone finance ministers in early December. That eurogroup meeting could be a significant moment in the crisis - ministers might agree a new precautionary credit line for Athens, to kick in when its bailout ends next year. Commissioner Katainen adds that he\u2019s also hoping to visit Greece too -- perhaps we could go together, Pierre? Commissioners Katainen and Moscovici argue that there is enough flexibility in the eurozone rules for struggling countries. Next question -- Can Germany still be a growth engine for the eurozone? Commissioner Katainen says that Germany can still play a significant role in stimulating the European economy. However, we can\u2019t just rely on one growth engine. We need several. Pierre Moscovici says the recent European elections show that the public can lose faith in the European project: Bruno Waterfield of the Daily Telegraph asks why membership of the eurozone leads to higher unemployment and lower growth rates. Commissioner Jyrki Katainen denies that the euro itself is to blame. Instead, he pins the blame on the financial markets. He says: The financial markets did not do their job properly...they were lending money to all member states at similar rates. A Spanish reporter points out that the EC has also cut its growth forecast for Spain next year, from 2.1% to 1.7%. Moscovici concludes his statement in Brussels by insisting there is no \u2018magic bullet\u2019. Governments must work closely together, and their first priority is to boost investment and kick start growth. Commissioner Moscovici explains that France and Italy will only see very modest recoveries next year. France will suffer from a \u2018subdued pace\u2019 of private consumption, and contracting investment. In Italy, growth won\u2019t return until early next year. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici (the former French finance minister) has warned that there is no \u201csingle, simple answer\u201d to the challenges facing the European economy. Moscovici adds: \u201cWe must all assume our responsibilities, in Brussels, in national capitals and in our regions, to generate higher growth and deliver a real boost to employment for our citizens.\u201d The EC has also slashed its growth forecast for this year, to just 0.8% Katainen says that the UK will probably grow at 3.1% this year, or almost four times faster than the eurozone average of 0.8%. Ireland will be the fastest-growing member of the EU, he adds, at 4.6%. European commissioner Jyrki Katainen is explaining today\u2019s autumn forecasts now. He says eurozone growth forecasts were revised down due to the weakening European economy, and the impact of geopolitical crises (such as Ukraine, I imagine). But he remains confident that growth will pick up, citing the impact of easier monetary conditions in the eurozone. \u201cLooking ahead we can see a gradual recovery\u201d Over in Brussels, the European Commission has just slashed its forecasts for growth and inflation. It also warned that unemployment will remain at its current high levels for longer than previously hoped. However, the EC still believes that the eurozone can avoid another recession. It now expects growth of just 1.1% in 2015, down from 1.7% previously. And it blamed problems in the eurozone\u2019s three largest economies, Italy, France and Germany. Marco Buti, the director general of the Commission\u2019s economics department, said in a statement that: \u201cThe slowdown in Europe has occurred as the legacy of the global financial and economic crisis lingers,\u201d \u201cWe see growth ... coming to a stop in Germany ... protracted stagnation in France and contraction in Italy,\u201d The EC also cut its inflation forecast for 2015, to just 0.8% from 1.2%. Despite the slowing growth in UK construction, sub-contractors managed to drive up their hourly pay rates at a \u201cnear-record\u201d pace, according to CIPS. That underlines that bricklayers, electricians, plasterers et al are in strong demand. Earlier today, the boss of housebuilder Persimmon, Jeff Fairburn, warned that a lack of tradesmen holding back housebuilding. He told Reuters: \u201cWith the volume increases we\u2019ve been achieving, it\u2019s naturally putting a strain on the trades that are available.\u201d \u201cThe turnover ... is very quick and we\u2019re struggling to put more stock on the ground.\u201d David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, points out that UK builders still face a challenge getting new supplies -- a sign of robust demand. \u201cThis month the construction sector maintained an impressive growth trajectory and true grit with continuing strong levels of new business, albeit at a slower pace. \u201cThough it appears that the euphoria of the last few months is now settling down to a slightly more modest level of expansion, delivery times continue to lengthen and suppliers of raw materials are in high demand, making the completion of construction projects more challenging and showing how the number of available suppliers has not yet reached pre-recession levels. And on a long-term view, Britain\u2019s construction sector is still enjoying one of its best periods in years (the higher the PMI, the stronger the growth) There is good news in today\u2019s survey -- UK construction firms still took on more staff last month. And more than half expect to grow their output over the next 12 months. But still, the slowing growth suggests that the tighter mortgage lending rules, and the prospect of interest rate rises, are hitting housebuilders. As Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, puts it: \u201cOctober\u2019s survey provides the first indication that the chill winds blowing across the UK housing market have started to weigh on the booming residential building sector. \u201cHouse building activity still increased at a strong pace overall, but the sharp growth slowdown since this summer reflects greater caution towards new development projects amid tighter mortgage lending conditions and renewed uncertainties about the demand outlook.\u201d Growth in the UK construction sector has hit a five-month low, as housing activity growth slows sharply. That\u2019s according to the monthly Purchasing Managers Index survey just released by data firm Markit\u2019s. Its PMI survey, which measures activity in the sector, has fallen to 61.4, down from 64.2 in September. Any reading of 50 or more shows growth, but this is quite a slowdown. Markit reports that:\uf0a7 \uf0a7 Construction output expands at weakest rate since May... \uf0a7 ..led by sharp slowdown in residential building growth \uf0a7 New business volumes increase at slowest pace for five months The rise in housing activity was the weakest for 12 months and much slower than in September, so perhaps Britain\u2019s housing boom is coming off the boil? Reaction to follow..... The Geek shall inherit the Irish earth this week with the opening of one of the biggest tech-summits on the planet in the Republic\u2019s capital, as Henry McDonald reports from Dublin: Some of the biggest players in the technology world will be at the Web Summit in Dublin this morning with more than 18,000 visitors from 109 countries attending. Among those mingling with the hi-tech industry will be U2\u2019s Bono, \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019 star Eva Longoria and Rio Ferdinand. The Republic\u2019s tourism body Failte Ireland estimate that the influx of techno-entrepreneurs, inventors and investors will generate \u20ac79 million in advertising revenue alone for the country as well as an injection of millions in hotel bookings with 13,000 rooms booked across 87 venues in Dublin. A number of new foreign investments into the Irish hi-tech sector are expected to be announced this week at the summit by Taoiseach Enda Kenny. Such is the importance Ireland\u2019s Industrial Development Authority is placing in the three day conference at Dublin\u2019s RDS conference centre that it has recalled its international representatives from its offices in New York, Silicon Valley, Frankfurt and London for the event. The IDA and the Irish government will be hoping that the proposed end of tax incentives for hi-tech giants such as the controversial \u201cdouble Irish\u201d scheme will not put off fresh investors establishing the Republic as their European beach heads. Stock market flotations are back on the agenda in the City, in a sign that confidence is returning after last month\u2019s volatility. Virgin Money, which put its IPO on ice as markets tumbled in October, has announced that the float is now rattling on all cylinders again. \u201cGiven more stable market conditions, we now plan to move forward with our IPO.\u201d The leverage ratios announced by the Bank of England last week, which weren\u2019t as restrictive as expected, also helped Virgin to return to the markets. And Fever-Tree, purveyor of \u201cpremium drink mixers\u201d to \u201cgastronomes\u201d (think tonic water, lemonade, lashings of ginger beer, etc etc) has priced its own float this morning. It will sell shares at 134p this morning, valuing the company at \u00a3154m. The number of unemployed people in Spain rose by 79,000 in October, according to figures released this morning, worse than the 73,000 expected. But on a seasonally adjusted basis, it actually fell by 19,393 people. That\u2019s the biggest decline for an October in 16 years, according to the Labour Ministry. This is the largest decrease in seasonally adjusted unemployment in the month of October since 1998. During the first ten months of 2014, registered unemployment has fallen by 174,534 people, which is also the biggest decline since 1998. But that still leaves 4,526,804 adults out of work, or around 24% of the labour force. Full details here. The unseasonably warm UK autumn hasn\u2019t hurt discount fashion chain Primark, unlike some of its more upmarket rivals. Primark\u2019s sales and profits are up around 10% in the last six weeks, according to the boss of its parent company, AB Foods. George Weston told Reuters that: \u201cI\u2019m really not concerned (by the weather) and we haven\u2019t had to delay or cancel any orders,\u201d \u201cYes, there\u2019s been an (weather) effect, but ... every year you get unseasonal weather at some point.\u201d Last week, Next warned that its profits have suffered from the rare sight of a hot, glowing object in the autumn skies over Britain. Tomorrow we find out how Marks &amp; Spencer fared.... Shares in German fashion group Hugo Boss have tumbled by 6.5% in early trading after it hit investors with a profit warning. Hugo Boss blamed the \u201csubstantial slowdown\u201d in Europe, and economic problems beyond, as it slashed its sales and operating profit targets. CEO Claus-Dietrich Lahrs explained: \u201cOver the last few weeks, our business has been increasingly feeling the effects of the weak performance of the sector in Europe and uncertainties in Asia.\u201d The company now only expects to achieve sales growth of 6-8% and profits growth of 5-7% in 2014, a downgrade on previous estimates that were in the high single digits. Shares dropped to \u20ac98.03 at the start of trading, down from \u20ac105.15 last night. Full story: Hugo Boss issues profits warning There\u2019s a new sheriff in town. Well, in Europe\u2019s banking sector, anyway. The European Central Bank has just taken \u201csupervisory responsibility\u201d for banks in the euro area, following last month\u2019s stress tests and asset quality reviews. It plans to \u201crebuild trust and bolsters the safety and soundness of the banking system\u201d, according to its new website. The Tokyo stock market rally came as prime minister Shinzo Abe welcomed the Bank of Japan\u2019s new stimulus measures. He told a parliamentary session that the BoJ\u2019s plan to create an additional 10 to 20 trillion yen per year had been \u201cbroadly welcomed\u201d by the financial markets. He also conceded that the depreciation in the yen would have some negative impact on Japan, as well as positive ones (helping exporters and pushing inflation up). Abe pledged to do \u201cwhatever we can do to respond to the change in the yen\u2019s value\u201d. The Japanese stock market has surged to new seven-year highs today, as the stimulus measures announced by the Bank of Japan on Friday cheer investors. The Nikkei index surged over the 17,000 point mark for the first time since the credit crunch struck the global economy in autumn 2007. It closed at 16,862, up 2.73%, adding to Friday\u2019s near 5% leap (Monday was a public holiday in Japan). Exporters led the gainers, following the sudden depreciation in the yen since last Friday morning (to over \u00a5113 to $1). Sony\u2019s share jumped 11%. Traders said the BoJ\u2019s decision to boost its asset purchase scheme was pushing money into equities. Toshihiko Matsuno, chief strategist at SMBC Friend Securities Co. in Tokyo, told Bloomberg that: \u201cThe impact of the BOJ\u2019s additional easing was big, so it couldn\u2019t be priced in during just one day....There is a risk in not holding Japanese shares, and those that sold them off will have to buy them back.\u201d The Nikkei was also driven up by the news that the Government Pension Investment Fund is changing its investment strategy, to buy more shares. Gavin Parry, managing director of Parry International Trading in Hong Kong, says this means \u201ca sea-change\u201d in investment decision making. \u201cThis is changing the risk-weighting psyche. You can\u2019t ignore a $1.2 trillion fund.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Coming up today.... The new team at the European Commission will get down to business today, by releasing their latest economic forecasts at 10am GMT. Commissioners Pierre Moscovici (ex French finance minister) and Jyrki Katainen (former PM of Finland) will be discussing the outlook for growth and jobs in the EU (neither look too rosy right now). European stock markets are expected to dip at the open, for the second day running. There\u2019s a lot of interest in commodities -- the oil price continued to dip last night, and iron ore is now at its cheapest since the 2009 recession. We get a new healthcheck on the UK construction sector at 9.30am; economists predict that growth remained pretty rapid in October. And overnight, the Australian central bank has left interest rates unchanged at their current record low of 2.5%. Governor Glen Stevens said the strength of the Australian dollar meant less pressure to raise borrowing costs: \u201cOn present indications, the most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.\u201d I\u2019ll be tracking all the main developments though the day....",

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US trade deficit slipped back a bit wider in September \u2013 following months where the trend has been for narrowing. This was not a petroleum story - the ex-petroleum deficit widened from $26.863bn to $29.028bn, more or less the same move as the total deficit ($39.991bn in August out to $43.032bn in September). This could strip off 0.2 percentage points from the 3.5% advance third quarter GDP release, assuming no offsetting moves from other aspects of the GDP release.</p> <p>The wider deficit was mainly the result of weak exports, not strong imports, and most of this occurred on the goods side, not services. It is possible that the dollar\u2019s strength has already begun to weigh on exports, but in our view, overseas economic weakness is a far more plausible explanation for the export dip. This back-step in the trade data may take the shine off the dollar for a short while, though the underlying story for dollar strength remains intact, and is likely to be bolstered by data out later in the week, including, importantly, non-farm payrolls on Friday.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5458c815e4b06c1c7adeb6c2\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-04T14:56:14.673Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Afternoon summary: growth cut again</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Time for a round-up.</strong></p> <p>The European Commission has warned that the eurozone economy is struggling to grow, after slashing its GDP forecasts over the next two years.</p> <p> In its autumn forecasts, the EC now expects growth of just 0.8% this year (down from 1.2%), rising to just 1.1% in 2015 (down from 1.7%).<br></p> <p><strong>Marco Buti</strong>, director general of Economic and Financial Affairs, warned:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the second half of this year, GDP growth in the EU is set to be very modest, while in the euro area it will almost stagnate.</p> </blockquote> <p>Buti warned that Europe\u2019s big four economies all face serious problems: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Among the largest euro area Member States, we see growth increasing in Spain where unemployment remains very high, growth coming to a stop in Germany after a very strong first quarter, protracted stagnation in France, and contraction in Italy.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/european_economy/2014/pdf/ee7_en.pdf\">The full report is online here (pdf)</a></h2> <p>And this map shows how many countries will struggle to grow this year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4777f8dceef68a0be40a9d3a1a584289078acd2\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/4/1415110455516/8f25f1b8-e55d-4424-bdb6-e6daa97bbf0a-460x402.png\" alt=\"EU growth forecasts, autumn 2014\" width=\"460\" height=\"402\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li>Italy is now expected to contract by 0.4% this year, down from 0.6% growth expected six months ago.<br></li> <li>Germany\u2019s growth forecast for 2014 was slashed to 1.3%, from 1.8%.

It also agreed collaborations with US businesses Pharmacyclics and Johnson &amp; Johnson to combine their drugs with its Imbruvica treatment against cancer. Primark owner Associated British Foods added 112p to \u00a327.83 while Imperial Tobacco was 110p better at \u00a327.77 and Legal &amp; General climbed 4.6p to 235.2p. Rolls-Royce rose 13p to 848p as it unveiled a restructuring including 2,600 job cuts and the sudden departure of its finance director. But oil shares came under pressure as the crude price continued to slide, with Saudi Arabia announcing price cuts to the US. Royal Dutch Shell B shares slipped 62p to \u00a322.20, BP fell 13.3p to 430.4p and Tullow Oil dropped 25.4p to 457.9p. Temporary power supplier Aggreko lost 65p to \u00a314.55 as Credit Suisse issued a downbeat note: Distributed generation (DG) capacity additions could see Aggreko\u2019s Power Projects addressable market shrink by a 3% compound annual growth rate to 2020, rather than expand at the company-projected 14% CAGR. DG roll-out has strong cost, technological and social drivers; GE projects it to account for 40% of global power capacity additions over the rest of the decade. This does not seem to have been factored into Aggreko\u2019s assumptions... we reiterate our underperform rating and cut our target price to 1240p (previously 1,471p).",

      "bodyText": "Primark has enjoyed a \u201cmagnificent year\u201d with profits racing ahead by 30% as it expands its cheap fashion empire abroad, the retailer said on Tuesday. Its relentless growth was not dented by autumn\u2019s unseasonably warm weather, which has hurt high street rivals as shoppers delayed buying jumpers, jackets and coats. Last week, Next, one of the UK\u2019s most successful retailers, and SuperGroup issued profits warnings as sales dipped in the warmth of an Indian summer. Primark sales rose 10% in the six weeks from mid-September, following the end of its financial year. George Weston, chief executive of Primark\u2019s parent company, Associated British Foods (ABF), admitted that the warm weather had hit sales in the first two weeks of September, but said the retailer was not discounting more than last year and had not delayed or cancelled any orders. \u201cSome of the ranges are selling really well, where we have got the fashion absolutely right. Denim is absolutely flying. Not surprisingly gloves and hats are not,\u201d he said. Primark\u2019s annual sales are close to \u00a35bn, having risen 17% in the year ending 17 September, mostly as a result of the addition of 1.4m sq ft of shopping space in its expansion abroad. Operating profits soared to \u00a3662m, a 30% rise. Excluding new stores, sales were up 4% on last year. The chain opened its first stores in France last year, with three in the Paris suburbs, one in Marseille and another in Dijon. Expansion will continue apace in the current financial year, with plans for just under 1m sq ft of new space including new stores in Milton Keynes, York and Carlisle as well as across Europe. The fashion retailer, which operates in nine countries, plans to open its first store in the US, an outlet in central Boston, at the end of 2015. Primark\u2019s heady pace of expansion has bolstered ABF, which is grappling with lower sugar prices that have reduced profits in its core business. Earnings from sugar fell 22% to \u00a32bn last year, slashing profits by 54% to \u00a3189m. World sugar prices are falling amid more competition in Europe as quotas are phased out. The strong pound also weighed on ABF\u2019s earnings and profits. The group reported revenues of \u00a312.9bn for its last financial year, down by 3% in real terms, although up 1% when based on the average exchange rate. Basic earnings per share rose 30% to 96.5p and pretax profits were up 18% to \u00a31.02bn. Weston said all parts of its business \u2013 which spans groceries, agriculture, ingredients and retail \u2013 had outperformed last year. \u201cPrimark\u2019s trading success and significant expansion delivered another magnificent year,\u201d he added. Retail analysts said Primark\u2019s performance was especially impressive as the retailer defies conventional wisdom by not offering online shopping, focusing instead on bricks-and-mortar stores. \u201cWith no digital channels to speak of, strategically spread physical representation remains absolutely essential,\u201d said Anusha Couttigane, senior consultant at analysts Conlumino. She believes that changing perceptions have also helped. \u201cShopping at Primark is no longer something to be whispered about,\u201d she said. \u201cImproved perceptions of its quality and fashionability have helped Primark to break through the fashion snobbery.\u201d Shoppers have not punished Primark for its links to the Rana Plaza factory building, which collapsed in Bangladesh last year killing more than 1,000 people. Weston said the company would complete compensation payments by Christmas, with remaining payments delayed while the most vulnerable families were given advice and support over how to manage large lump-sum payouts. Since the disaster, Primark has assessed the structural strength of all its suppliers\u2019 buildings in Bangladesh and will now continue that process elsewhere starting with India, Pakistan and Cambodia. \u2018Twosie\u2019 trend takes off Primark is backing the \u201ctwosie\u201d as this year\u2019s Christmas novelty hit in the UK, just as 2012\u2019s craze the onesie has crossed the Channel in a late surge of popularity on the continent. George Weston, chief executive of the retailer\u2019s parent group Associated British Foods, said the head-to-toe matching outfits, which sit somewhere betweenpyjamas and a tracksuit were already selling well. \u201cThe twosie will be important,\u201d he said, echoing predictions from supermarket Sainsbury\u2019s and other retailers searching for a replacement for the onesie fervour after the garment was favoured by the likes of Harry Styles, Cara Delevingne and Justin Bieber. \u201cOnesies still have a way to run in Europe. The rising hit in the UK will be twosies, although a lot of people will be buying onesies and they will be even more spectacular with heads, tails and maybe lights,\u201d Weston said. He predicted that Christmas jumpers, last year\u2019s novelty festive hit, would continue to be popular but would be more ornate, featuring music and flashing lights. Sarah Butler",

      "bodyText": "UK housebuilding grew at the slowest rate in a year last month in the latest sign of a cooling housing market. Slower residential building pushed growth in construction output to a five-month low, according to the Markit/Cips construction purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The housebuilding measure of the PMI dropped to 61 in October, the lowest since October 2013.

      "bodyText": "Despite oil companies proving a drag on the market, leading shares are managing to make a little headway. Imperial Tobacco is among the main risers, up 79p to \u00a327.46. The cigarette maker saw a decline in full year revenues and profits, hit by exchange rates and declining sales as people cut back or quit smoking. But it has tackled this with cost cuts, saving \u00a360m during the year, and the figures were in line with expectations. Tobacco revenues fell 6% to \u00a36.5bn and adjusted operating profit was down 5% to \u00a33bn. It also said it was lifting its full year dividend by 10%. During the year it raised \u00a3395m with the partial IPO of its Logista business in Europe, with the proceeds going to reduce debt. A deal with Lorillard and Reynolds to boost its US presence should be completed next spring, and it also sees big opportunities in emerging markets. Chief executive Alison Cooper said: Trading conditions remain tough in many territories but the actions we\u2019ve taken to enhance the quality and sustainability of the business have put us in a stronger position to drive growth and create sustainable value for our shareholders. Oriel Securities issued a buy note, saying: Imperial Tobacco released 2014 full year results which were in line with both the market and our own expectations. Importantly, Imperial delivered its promised 10% dividend advance in 2014 and remains on track to hand over a similar gain in 2015. Conditions in mature markets continue to be described as challenging. However, we continue to see examples of firm pricing at the premium end of the market \u2013 notably in the UK. At this stage Imperial appears comfortable with current consensus for earnings per share growth in 2015, which is for around 2.5% in reported currency and 4.5% in constant \u2013 i.e. the company is back to mid-singles growth, which is important given its 10% dividend growth ambitions. With a 12.6 times calendar 2015 PE and 5.4% calendar 2015 dividend yield, Imperial Tobacco continues to look attractively valued given its underlying improvements on trading and operational performance. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 17.50 points at 6505.47, helped by Japanese shares hitting a seven year high after last week\u2019s news of the country\u2019s central bank moves to increase its stimulus programme to boost the economy. But there was some caution ahead of the latest meetings of the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, as well as Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers. Other risers so far include Legal &amp; General, up 4.3p to 234.9p after it said it generated 12% more cash in the first nine months of the year, lifted by corporate annuity sales. But oil companies have been on the slide after crude fell again. Brent is down 1.49% to $83.52 a barrel after Saudi Arabia cut prices to the US although it raised prices elsewhere. Royal Dutch Shell B shares are down 35.5p to 2246.5p while BP has lost 4.95p to 438.75p. Tullow Oil has fallen 8.9p to 474.4p. Credit Suisse has given a boost to Schroders, up 58p to \u00a324.48, and Man, 4.3p better at 127.7p. The bank said: Following the market weakness at the end of the third quarter and beginning of the fourth, we are turning more positive on the European asset managers and upgrade Schroders to outperform (from neutral)... we reinstate coverage on Man Group with an outperform rating and 138p target price.
