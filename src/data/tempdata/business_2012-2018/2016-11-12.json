      "bodyText": "Since Trump won, as is to be expected after a shock election result, the blame stick has been hurled far and wide, hitting everyone from white women to black women to poor people to white men to hispanics to the musical Hamilton and the polling guys like Nate Silver. Silver especially is targeted because his model predicted Clinton had a 71% chance of victory. Other models in the New York Times and Huffington Post had Clinton\u2019s chance much stronger. It has led to fights and debates over who was right or more precisely, least wrong. Oddly this argument over the models had begun before the election day with Silver and Huffington Post\u2019s Ryan Griff having it out over the relative worth of their models. There was a lot of back and forth, and a lot of people tweeting about it. Seriously, who gives a damn? I\u2019m not blaming Silver or any poll aggregators for the result \u2013 that would be silly. But as they now occupy a major part of the media, we should be honest: poll aggregation has become everything it hated and is actually worse for coverage of elections and politics that what it replaced. Poll aggregators in the US and in Australia sprung up on blogs in the mid 2000s as a response to the then stupid reporting of polls. Chief political writers would report on two percentage point shifts in Newspoll as massive news one week and a fortnight later a shift back of two percentage points as separate massive news. All the shifts were explained due to things the journalists knew to be true because they knew more than we did about what really was going on. The poll aggregators instead realised that individual polls were erratic, and that most of the commentary was about statistical noise rather than actual shifts in voters\u2019 preferences. They instead bundled (or aggregated) all the polls to come out with a less noisy number. And at the time I thought their analysis a welcome addition that changed the coverage for the better. Journalists became more statistically aware and now always mention margins of error and talk of the trend. But the overarching problem of the poll reportage was not that it was inaccurate but that it occurred at all. Reporting of polls automatically converts the coverage into a horse-race. That coverage is a massive media failure and poll aggregators greatly increase the failure. Now I love data, and I don\u2019t pretend that what I do is somehow beyond criticism \u2013 as Katharine Murphy has written, the election result should have all in the media realising their work \u201cis making little or no difference\u201d \u2013 but polls are not economic or social data. They don\u2019t record how many sales or prices or even estimate employment. They record the feelings of people about what they might do in a week, month, year\u2019s time. But they do convey a sense of fact \u2013 they are quantitative, and thus they tempt you into thinking they are more true than a qualitative report. Numbers don\u2019t lie! And so you get seduced. I was guilty of it. Even throughout this year while I was writing against them and arguing with friends about how pointless the polls coverage was, I would check the 538 website to see what the percentages were. It\u2019s tough to resist. And the problem is this love of data has made the horse race coverage seem legitimate \u201chard news\u201d (numbers are facts!), and as a result, the performance of polling has come to define the performance of election coverage This is not merely a US phenomenon. We saw it here in Australia after the election when media outlets tried to explain \u201cwhy they got it wrong\u201d. But polling coverage is not hard news, it is entertainment disguised as hard news. Many polling aggregators like Silver originally used their statistical knowledge to analyse sport. And such data crunching is perfect for sport. Sport statistics involve things that have actually occurred \u2013 runs scored, tackles, or turnovers conceded \u2013 rather than opinions (no one analyses how many runs a team says it will make in a month\u2019s time). It allows sports supporters to play the role of coach, because in effect such data analysis gives a reader greater understanding of the coach\u2019s \u201cpolicies\u201d. But political polls don\u2019t do that. Rather than coaches, they transform us into campaign managers, but managers insidiously removed from reality. We look at polling maps and data and think, \u201cOh the poll numbers are weak in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, but looking good for Hispanics aged under 30\u201d. But what the hell does that mean? What does a weak poll in Wisconsin tell us? Does it mean a better health policy needed? Immigration reform? A different candidate? It\u2019s great for conversations over a beer, but awful for covering an election. Political polling coverage is actually a step removed in a way that analysis of sporting statistics is not. We see this in the analysis suggesting Clinton ignored Wisconsin \u2013 she didn\u2019t hold one rally there; and those loudly decrying that she only started going to Michigan in the last couple weeks. Immediately we go into a campaign-manager mindset. It traps us into thinking about the \u201cground game\u201d, the advertising buys, the rally numbers and locations of the candidate on various days \u2013 as though that actually matters to the voters, and as if reading about such things actually helps voters make a decision. We think like a campaign manager; but one with no interest in policies or voters other than as numbers on a map. It was bad enough when you had the chief political writer interpreting the polling data like Moses come down from the mount, but it is even worse when you have whole teams devoted to the polls. For the numbers and hype about the models are all geared towards convincing us (with appropriate caveats to save themselves afterwards) that their numbers are more factual and the analysis behind it more trustworthy than that done by the old rube churning out copy about the latest 2% point movement in Newspoll. Look at the graphs, look at the arrows on the dial! That\u2019s not opinion; it\u2019s data at work! We fall victim to it. It is almost impossible to resist. We want to believe that the data will save us and we\u2019ll even ignore that the data is just a lot of feelings if that helps us to believe. Like investors in crappy mortgage-backed security derivatives that banks convinced people were trustworthy because the risk was in effect aggregated, we forgot that polls aggregation does not make the polls any more factual, and certainly no more important. And in the end, it is not accuracy but importance that truly matters. The problem is not whether Silver\u2019s \u2013 or anyone else\u2019s \u2013 polling model was wrong, the problem is that we think it is important whether or not they were.",

    "webTitle": "Tesco cyber-raid raises serious questions over UK banks\u2019 security", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The texts began arriving on customers\u2019 phones over the weekend: Tesco Bank had spotted unusual activity on a significant number of current accounts, and was getting in touch with customers to alert them. But that wasn\u2019t enough to prevent \u00a32.5m being siphoned out of about 9,000 accounts, and transferred to criminals whose identities and locations remain a mystery. The damage to the bank\u2019s reputation may be significant \u2013 but more significant still is that the attack is only the latest, and presently most visible, example of a rising tide of onslaughts against online banking, which seek to exploit any weak spot in web-facing computer systems and their users. The hackers\u2019 motives are straightforward. As the wild west bank robber Willie Sutton explained when asked to explain his motivation: \u201cThat\u2019s where the money is.\u201d And experts warn that 2016, which has already seen an audacious attempt to steal \u00a3763m ($951m) electronically from Bangladesh\u2019s central bank in the spring, is the precursor for much worse to come. \u201cBecause a lot of economies aren\u2019t in good shape, you\u2019ll see more and more skilled computing people being out of work, and turning to the dark side where they work for criminals,\u201d says Ilia Kolochenko, chief executive of High-Tech Bridge, a web security company. \u201cAnd at the same time you\u2019ve got a lot of companies trying to optimise their costs, and preferring to save money on the cyber side. It\u2019s hard to predict how successful and how large the scale will be, but I\u2019m pretty sure it will get worse.\u201d The Bangladesh attack occurred in February, when hackers broke into the Swift network, the international financial transfer information system, and told the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to make 32 transactions totalling $951m to accounts around the world. Although only $101m, in two transactions, was paid out, a total of $63m has not been recovered. Swift has since warned banks to update their software. It is highly unlikely that the same group was behind the Tesco Bank attack; the amounts involved \u2013 and number of accounts \u2013 are so different as to imply separate operations. However, this suggests that various gangs are trying to break into banks and accounts online. There have certainly been a number of online raids \u2013 some involving big money. In 2013, online security company Kaspersky said that as much as $900m had been stolen from 100 banks after their internal systems were infected with malware. And in late 2015, the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency investigated the theft of \u00a320m from several accounts, enabled by malware which had infiltrated customers\u2019 PCs. There are suspicions that Tesco Bank\u2019s security model was more vulnerable to compromise than it should have been: once logged in to a current account, a user could set up a transfer to a current account in another bank without having to get an SMS confirmation. The question, still unanswered, is how the accounts were targeted. It is possible that the hackers found a weakness in the back-office systems \u2013 possibly from a current or former employee, suggests Kolochenko. Tesco Bank declined to discuss whether there are any patterns in the accounts that were targeted: \u201cThis is a criminal matter, and so we are constrained in what we can say,\u201d a spokesman said. He declined to say whether any criminals had been identified or what lines of investigation were being pursued. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told MPs last week that \u201cthere are elements of this [attack] that look unprecedented\u201d, but did not elucidate. What parts are unprecedented? The fraud was far from the largest conducted on a UK bank; in September, the23-year-old head of a fraud ring, Feezan Hameed, was jailed for 11 years, after his gang stole \u00a3113m from British banks. They fooled people into thinking they were talking to their bank, and got them to hand over their internet details \u2013 which he would then use to get access to their accounts. Only \u00a347m has been recovered. So if the FCA\u2019s Bailey is worried, it must be about the online nature and the scale of the attack \u2013 not its value. And this is the concern: if criminals can compromise 9,000 accounts in a matter of hours during a weekend and siphon off an average of \u00a3280 from each one before being spotted, what\u2019s to prevent it being done to an even greater number of accounts for greater amounts of money, and leaving banks to pick up the pieces? What\u2019s to stop it being done to any bank every night? The idea of banks building up a false sense of security before a disaster might sound familiar. Simon Moores, an independent consultant on security, likens the situation now to the US financial market in 2006/7, when complacency over the inherent risks of mortgage-based products was compounded by ratings agencies which had an interest in certifying sketchy financial instruments as safe. \u201cIt\u2019s just like The Big Short,\u201d Moores says, referring to the film and book about the lead-up to the financial collapse, which was forecast by only a few. \u201cThe computer security industry is worth \u00a330bn, but it doesn\u2019t work any more. Having a box to protect your bank website or business doesn\u2019t work. But nobody is prepared to accept the fact.\u201d Banks don\u2019t like discussing hacks; more than 100 banks are reckoned to have had up to $900m stolen in late 2013, according to security company Kaspersky. The hackers compromised internal computers and used video feeds for months to learn daily routines. Moores points out that 2015 was a record year for cyber-attacks globally \u2013 but that\u2019s only because 2016 hasn\u2019t finished yet. Malware \u2013 which tries to attack PCs or corporate systems \u2013 is on the rise: \u201cThere are now thought to be more than 500 million worms, Trojans and other viruses in circulation, and reportedly every day there\u2019s another 1.25 million \u2018polymorphic\u2019 threats [which change as they are copied between machines, making identification harder].\u201d For banks, the attraction of online banking is clear: it doesn\u2019t require expensive offices in high streets, or the employment of thousands of tellers who might be vulnerable to criminals through blackmail or greed. Instead, it relies on computers, and a relatively small and highly trained (and well-paid) staff, while the customer-support function normally done by tellers can be outsourced to call centres that have little more access than ordinary customers to the banks\u2019 databases. For the customer, online banking should mean greater convenience \u2013 it can be done anywhere and any time you can get an internet connection \u2013 and reliability, since the challenges (such as passwords and memorable words or phrases) you face to log on successfully are more complex than a simple four-digit number at a cash machine. But for both, inserting a computer between the customer and the bank has opened up new risks from malware targeting web browsers, computers and mobile phones. Browsers, software and computers \u2013 both the customers\u2019 and the banks\u2019 \u2013 can have mysterious bugs which allow access to hackers and leave almost no trace; there is a constant need for bug-finding and updates to defeat them. Even while banks strengthen their software, though, the weak link can lie outside. One of the biggest problems for online banking was the malware Zeus, which defeated many antivirus packages. First seen in 2007, it lurked in the background of Windows computers infected via email attachments or web pages and captured logon passwords and account numbers. By 2010, it had infected nearly 4m PCs. In April two men \u2013 a 27-year-old Russian called Aleksandr Andreevich Panin and an Algerian accomplice, Hamza Bendelladj, were given prison sentences totalling more than 24 years for their role in creating and running a \u201cbotnet\u201d of infected computers called SpyEye, which relied on Zeus and had stolen more than $100m from US banks and, by extension, their customers. By 2011, there were versions of Zeus that infected smartphones running on Google\u2019s Android, putting banking apps at risk. So far though, banks appear to have managed to stay ahead in the arms race; the growth in the use of smartphones may actually have helped, because their security model is generally better than PCs, holding apps in deeper \u201csilos\u201d. Customers have often borne the cost of the skirmishes, though. Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University\u2019s computer security group, has clashed with the UK\u2019s financial instutions for more than a decade, first over weaknesses in cash-machine security and more recently over banks\u2019 reluctance to accept the cost of online fraud, while they reap the profits of lower online overheads. Customers who have been defrauded often have to fight for their refunds, Anderson says. Many of those whose money was stolen by Hameed are still trying to get their money back, he points out. \u201cAs long as UK banks don\u2019t have to bear the cost of fraud, they won\u2019t have an incentive to improve their security,\u201d he says. He notes that the Tesco case \u2013 in which refunds were immediate \u2013 was a rare and welcome exception. He notes too, that being able to transfer money more quickly has brought significant problems. \u201cIn the old days, if you wanted to send \u00a31,000 to your aunt in Australia, it would cost you \u00a330 and take four days and you might have to visit the branch. Now it can be set up and sent in seconds. If you\u2019re a fraud victim, you can\u2019t stop it.\u201d It might sound strange for a computer security expert to bemoan faster payments. But the problem is more one of imperfect authentication: clearly, something failed at Tesco. Because thousands of customers were affected by the attack, Tesco paid up; but when a single person or business is hit by Zeus or another variant, banks often dispute it. Anderson says: \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t design systems for perfect humans who can recall dozens of passwords. They should design for people as they are, faults and all.\u201d Moores says the threat to the users, and the banks, will only increase. \u201cThe attacks are going to get automated, and they\u2019re going to recruit machine learning \u2013 that stuff\u2019s not just for Google.\u201d RISING TIDE OF HACKING Banks don\u2019t like to talk about online hacking, especially when it involves customer accounts. But here are some that we know of. 2013 As many as 100 banks worldwide are discovered to have been infiltrated by malware \u2013 sent as email attachments to bank employees \u2013 which sent back video and other data from internal networks. That helped hackers to steal a total of $900m, according to the Kaspersky Lab, which claims it had gone on for almost two years. Neither the amounts stolen nor the details have been confirmed. December 2014 About 730,000 login details for wealthy clients of Morgan Stanley are offered for sale online, after being stolen by an employee, 30-year-old Galen Marsh, between 2011 and 2014. Morgan Stanley says it found no evidence that customers lost any money. Marsh pleaded guilty in September 2015, receiving 36 months\u2019 probation. Morgan Stanley was fined $1m. Meanwhile, hackers in Russia and Ukraine break into the internal networks at financial institutions in their countries and infect ATMs with malware that would give them 50 times the amount they seemed to be taking out. The group is reckoned to have gained access by buying access to PCs already infected by opportunistic hackers using weaknesses in Microsoft Office and Windows. January 2015 Hackers acquire codes from Swift, the international financial network which enables transfers between banks, to get access to a bank in Ecuador, Banco del Austro, and transfer $12m out of it via Wells Fargo to banks in Hong Kong, Los Angeles and Dubai. The bank sues Wells Fargo but does not tell Swift, which only learns of the incident via a lawsuit in May 2016. April 2015 Ryanair confirms that \u00a33.3m has been stolen from it by a fraudulent transfer via a Chinese bank. Neither the bank nor Ryanair offers any information about how the fraud happened. Late 2015 The UK\u2019s National Crime Agency investigates a series of bank frauds enabled by malware called Dridex, which infects PCs and harvests online banking details from users. British accounts are reckoned to have had \u00a320m taken from them and paid to accounts in eastern Europe. February 2016 $81m is stolen from Bangladesh\u2019s central bank; investigators link the malware used to break into the systems to that used to penetrate Sony Pictures in 2014 by a hacking group called Lazarus. The hackers had sought to transfer $1bn, but a fault in their code halted the transaction early. May 2016 Swift says a Vietnamese bank has been hacked, but doesn\u2019t disclose whether any money was lost, or which bank is involved. It urges its members, numbering more than 9,000, to keep their software up to date. June 2016 $10m is stolen from a bank in Ukraine after the Swift system is exploited using a method similar to that used against the Bangladesh central bank in February. November 2016 Tesco Bank says \u00a32.5m has been stolen over the weekend of 5-6 November from the accounts of about 9,000 customers, out of a total of 136,000. All have been refunded; questions remain about how the transfers were made. Tesco could face a substantial fine from regulators.",

      "body": "<p>The texts began arriving on customers\u2019 phones over the weekend: Tesco Bank had spotted unusual activity on a significant number of current accounts, and was getting in touch with customers to alert them. But that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/tesco-bank-cyber-thieves-25m\" title=\"\">wasn\u2019t enough to prevent \u00a32.5m being siphoned out of about 9,000 accounts</a>, and transferred to criminals whose identities and locations remain a mystery.</p> <p>The damage to the bank\u2019s reputation may be significant \u2013 but more significant still is that the attack is only the latest, and presently most visible, example of a rising tide of onslaughts against online banking, which seek to exploit any weak spot in web-facing computer systems and their users.</p> <p>The hackers\u2019 motives are straightforward. As the wild west bank robber Willie Sutton explained when asked to explain his motivation: \u201cThat\u2019s where the money is.\u201d</p> <p>And experts warn that 2016, which has already seen an audacious attempt to steal \u00a3763m ($951m) electronically from Bangladesh\u2019s central bank in the spring, is the precursor for much worse to come.</p> <p>\u201cBecause a lot of economies aren\u2019t in good shape, you\u2019ll see more and more skilled computing people being out of work, and turning to the dark side where they work for criminals,\u201d says Ilia Kolochenko, chief executive of High-Tech Bridge, a web security company. \u201cAnd at the same time you\u2019ve got a lot of companies trying to optimise their costs, and preferring to save money on the cyber side. It\u2019s hard to predict how successful and how large the scale will be, but I\u2019m pretty sure it will get worse.\u201d</p> <p>The Bangladesh attack occurred in February, when hackers broke into the Swift network, the international financial transfer information system, and told the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to make 32&#xa0;transactions totalling $951m to accounts around the world. Although only $101m, in two transactions, was paid out, a total of $63m has not been recovered. Swift has since warned banks to update their software.</p> <p>It is highly unlikely that the same group was behind the Tesco Bank attack; the amounts involved \u2013 and number of accounts \u2013 are so different as to imply separate operations. However, this suggests that various gangs are trying to break into banks and accounts online. There have certainly been a number of online raids \u2013 some involving big money. In 2013, online security company Kaspersky said that as much as $900m had been stolen from 100 banks after their internal systems were infected with malware.</p> <p>And in late 2015, the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency investigated the theft of \u00a320m from several accounts, enabled by malware which had infiltrated customers\u2019 PCs.</p> <p>There are suspicions that Tesco Bank\u2019s security model was more vulnerable to compromise than it should have been: once logged in to a current account, a user could set up a transfer to a current account in another bank without having to get an SMS confirmation. The question, still unanswered, is how the accounts were targeted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a3444292752405ad86bd6f0a05a1a693094082c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a3444292752405ad86bd6f0a05a1a693094082c/0_42_1380_1724/800.jpg\" alt=\"Feezan Hameed, jailed for 11 years over thefts of \u00a3113m from British banks.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feezan Hameed, jailed for 11 years over thefts of \u00a3113m from British banks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Metropolitan Police/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is possible that the hackers found a weakness in the back-office systems \u2013 possibly from a current or former employee, suggests Kolochenko.</p> <p>Tesco Bank declined to discuss whether there are any patterns in the accounts that were targeted: \u201cThis is a criminal matter, and so we are constrained in what we can say,\u201d a spokesman said. He declined to say whether any criminals had been identified or what lines of investigation were being pursued.</p> <p>Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told MPs last week that \u201cthere are elements of this [attack] that look unprecedented\u201d, but did not elucidate.</p> <p>What parts are unprecedented? The fraud was far from the largest conducted on a UK bank; in September, the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/21/feezan-hameed-fraud-gang-jailed-11-years-southwark-crown-court\" title=\"\">23-year-old head of a fraud ring, Feezan Hameed, was jailed for 11 years</a>, after his gang stole \u00a3113m from British banks. They fooled people into thinking they were talking to their bank, and got them to hand over their internet details \u2013 which he would then use to get access to their accounts. Only \u00a347m has been recovered.</p> <p>So if the FCA\u2019s Bailey is worried, it must be about the online nature and the scale of the attack \u2013 not its value. And this is the concern: if criminals can compromise 9,000 accounts in a matter of hours during a weekend and siphon off an average of \u00a3280 from each one before being spotted, what\u2019s to prevent it being done to an even greater number of accounts for greater amounts of money, and leaving banks to pick up the pieces? What\u2019s to stop it being done to any bank every night?</p> <p>The idea of banks building up a false sense of security before a disaster might sound familiar. Simon Moores, an independent consultant on security, likens the situation now to the US financial market in 2006/7, when complacency over the inherent risks of mortgage-based products was compounded by ratings agencies which had an interest in certifying sketchy financial instruments as safe. \u201cIt\u2019s just like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/30/michael-lewis-the-big-short-interview\" title=\"\"><em>The Big Short</em></a>,\u201d Moores says, referring to the film and book about the lead-up to the financial collapse, which was forecast by only a few. \u201cThe computer security industry is worth \u00a330bn, but it doesn\u2019t work any more. Having a box to protect your bank website or business doesn\u2019t work. But nobody is prepared to accept the fact.\u201d</p> <p>Banks don\u2019t like discussing hacks; more than 100 banks are reckoned to have had up to $900m stolen in late 2013, according to security company Kaspersky. The hackers compromised internal computers and used video feeds for months to learn daily routines.</p> <p>Moores points out that 2015 was a record year for cyber-attacks globally \u2013 but that\u2019s only because 2016 hasn\u2019t finished yet. Malware \u2013 which tries to attack PCs or corporate systems \u2013 is on the rise: \u201cThere are now thought to be more than 500 million worms, Trojans and other viruses in circulation, and reportedly every day there\u2019s another 1.25 million \u2018polymorphic\u2019 threats [which change as they are copied between machines, making identification harder].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3460967f6331b319589b08b33e1512d40ef6528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3460967f6331b319589b08b33e1512d40ef6528/0_139_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Federal Reserve Bank in New York, which was told to make 32 transactions totalling $951m for accounts around the world after hackers got into the transfer system.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Federal Reserve Bank in New York, which was told to make 32 transactions totalling $951m for accounts around the world after hackers got into the transfer system.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Gombert/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For banks, the attraction of online banking is clear: it doesn\u2019t require expensive offices in high streets, or the employment of thousands of tellers who might be vulnerable to criminals through blackmail or greed. Instead, it relies on computers, and a relatively small and highly trained (and well-paid) staff, while the customer-support function normally done by tellers can be outsourced to call centres that have little more access than ordinary customers to the banks\u2019 databases.</p> <p>For the customer, online banking should mean greater convenience \u2013 it can be done anywhere and any time you can get an internet connection \u2013 and reliability, since the challenges (such as passwords and memorable words or phrases) you face to log on successfully are more complex than a simple four-digit number at a cash machine.</p> <p>But for both, inserting a computer between the customer and the bank has opened up new risks from malware targeting web browsers, computers and mobile phones. Browsers, software and computers \u2013 both the customers\u2019 and the banks\u2019 \u2013 can have mysterious bugs which allow access to hackers and leave almost no trace; there is a constant need for bug-finding and updates to defeat them.</p> <p>Even while banks strengthen their software, though, the weak link can lie outside. One of the biggest problems for online banking was the malware Zeus, which defeated many antivirus packages. First seen in 2007, it lurked in the background of Windows computers infected via email attachments or web pages and captured logon passwords and account numbers. By 2010, it had infected nearly 4m PCs.</p> <p>In April two men \u2013 a 27-year-old Russian called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/21/hackers-jailed-over-spyeye-virus-that-robbed-bank-accounts-worldwide\" title=\"\">Aleksandr Andreevich Panin and an Algerian accomplice, Hamza Bendelladj</a><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga/pr/two-major-international-hackers-who-developed-spyeye-malware-get-over-24-years-combined\" title=\"\">, were given prison sentences totalling more than 24 years</a> for their role in creating and running a \u201cbotnet\u201d of infected computers called SpyEye, which relied on Zeus and had stolen more than $100m from US banks and, by extension, their customers. By 2011, there were versions of Zeus that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/jul/22/smartphones-hacked-zeus-malware\" title=\"\">infected smartphones running on Google\u2019s Android</a>, putting banking apps at risk.</p> <p>So far though, banks appear to have managed to stay ahead in the arms race; the growth in the use of smartphones may actually have helped, because their security model is generally better than PCs, holding apps in deeper \u201csilos\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be99d17419211233039a9e7fb2dd2006f8dd29e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be99d17419211233039a9e7fb2dd2006f8dd29e8/0_194_4341_2605/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banking app security appears to be better than it is on PCs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banking app security appears to be better than it is on PCs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Customers have often borne the cost of the skirmishes, though. Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University\u2019s computer security group, has clashed with the UK\u2019s financial instutions for more than a decade, first over weaknesses in cash-machine security and more recently over banks\u2019 reluctance to accept the cost of online fraud, while they reap the profits of lower online overheads.</p> <p>Customers who have been defrauded often have to fight for their refunds, Anderson says. Many of those whose money was stolen by Hameed are still trying to get their money back, he points out.</p> <p>\u201cAs long as UK banks don\u2019t have to bear the cost of fraud, they won\u2019t have an incentive to improve their security,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He notes that the Tesco case \u2013 in which refunds were immediate \u2013 was a rare and welcome exception. He notes too, that being able to transfer money more quickly has brought significant problems.</p> <p>\u201cIn the old days, if you wanted to send \u00a31,000 to your aunt in Australia, it would cost you \u00a330 and take four days and you might have to visit the branch. Now it can be set up and sent in seconds. If you\u2019re a fraud victim, you can\u2019t stop it.\u201d</p> <p>It might sound strange for a computer security expert to bemoan faster payments. But the problem is more one of imperfect authentication: clearly, something failed at Tesco. Because thousands of customers were affected by the attack, Tesco paid up; but when a single person or business is hit by Zeus or another variant, banks often dispute it.</p> <p>Anderson says: \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t design systems for perfect humans who can recall dozens of passwords. They should design for people as they are, faults and all.\u201d</p> <p>Moores says the threat to the users, and the banks, will only increase. \u201cThe attacks are going to get automated, and they\u2019re going to recruit machine learning \u2013 that stuff\u2019s not just for Google.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86859a1fcda45d06427c8099c47d0655da1d0998\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86859a1fcda45d06427c8099c47d0655da1d0998/0_0_3467_2081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A customer uses a machine at a Tesco Bank cash point.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The battered pound has notched up its best two-week performance in eight years after the surprise US election result took investor focus off the UK\u2019s Brexit challenges. Market concerns shifted to the euro amid fears that Donald Trump\u2019s victory will trigger a wave of populism and political uncertainty throughout Europe. Measured against other currencies, sterling enjoyed its best fortnight since 2008. It remains well below pre-referendum levels, but on Friday managed to push above $1.26 for the first time since early October. That will soothe concerns over a weak currency pushing up import costs and stoking inflation. While the pound rebounded, the FTSE 100 share index fell by more than 1% for the second day running, erasing all the gains made on the day of Trump\u2019s win. That capped a tumultuous week for financial markets as investors proffered diverging views over what a Trump presidency would mean for US growth, global trade and individual shares. Debate raged over whether a big spender in the White House would boost economic activity and inflation in the world\u2019s leading economy or whether his anti-trade stance would curb growth around the globe. There was also uncertainty over how his campaign trail rhetoric would translate into clampdowns for some sectors, such as technology companies and other internationally focused firms, and into deregulation for others, including energy and banking. Amid all the confusion, the pound was a a clear outperformer. Against the euro it was up 0.75% to \u20ac1.1608. Analysts offered various explanations for its rebound this week. \u201cThere may be some hopes that Trump\u2019s election victory could put the UK at the front of the queue for a post-Brexit trade deal with the US, although at the very least this week\u2019s events have shifted the focus away from the UK\u2019s impending departure from the EU,\u201d said Chris Saint, a senior analyst at the financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown. Jasper Lawler, a market analyst at the spread-betting and trading firm CMC Markets, also highlighted hopes of a UK trade deal with the US as well as other factors. \u201cOn the EU side, there is rising concern that upcoming elections, starting with the Italian referendum next month, mean it is the next target for the rise in populism,\u201d he said. \u201cThe British pound as a top foreign-exchanges gainer this week bucks the trend of Brexit-induced weakness seen over the past few months. There\u2019s an element of simply a shift in focus behind this. The phenomenon of Donald Trump as US president-elect has put Brexit on the back-burner, allowing the pound to creep higher.\u201d On the FTSE 100 index, the pound\u2019s recovery put pressure on those companies that report in dollars. They had been bolstered in recent months from sterling\u2019s slump as it flatters their finances and also increases competitiveness for UK firms that export. On Friday the blue-chip index closed down 1.4%, or 97.6 points lower, at 6,730.43. Firms exposed to emerging markets were among the biggest losers as investors fretted over how Trump\u2019s anti-trade stance will hurt their prospects. On Wall Street, a Trump-driven rally petered out and after hitting a fresh record high on Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average eased back and was bobbing around the unchanged mark during Friday afternoon trading. Banking shares have benefited since the Trump victory as investors reminded themselves of his campaign pledge to tear up Dodd Frank \u2013 post-banking crisis reforms \u2013 and other regulations. Deutsche Bank was given a fillip on hopes that the Department of Justice would accelerate its talks over a settlement for a decade-old mis-selling scandal but demand less than the initial $14bn. Fears Deutsche cannot pay this sum have driven its shares to 30-year lows below \u20ac10, although on Friday they rose by 4.6% to their highest level since late June. \u201cThe sweeping Republican victories on 9 November mean that some of the Democrat appointments at the US Department of Justice have only a few weeks left before they are replaced. Accelerating litigation settlements with banks may be one way to end a DoJ tenure with a sense of achievement. Swifter resolution would likely result in smaller settlements for the banks, since larger fines could lead to [potentially lengthy] court cases,\u201d said analysts at Barclays, who said this would help Deutsche and Credit Suisse. But it could be more troublesome for Royal Bank of Scotland, 73% owned by UK taxpayers, which is yet to begin settlement talks over the same mis-selling scandal involving residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS). More broadly, Trump\u2019s fiscal stimulus policies might also help. \u201cThis comes at a time when the confidence in the efficacy of monetary policy appears to be on the wane in any event \u2026 Shifting the focus of the rates debate would undoubtedly be helpful for the revenue outlook at European banks,\u201d the Barclays analysts said.",

      "body": "<p>The battered pound has notched up its best two-week performance in eight years after the surprise US election result took investor focus off the UK\u2019s Brexit challenges. </p> <p>Market concerns shifted to the euro amid fears that Donald Trump\u2019s victory will trigger a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/05/economic-woe-trump-style-movements-created-worldwide\">wave of populism</a> and political uncertainty throughout Europe.</p> <p>Measured against other currencies, sterling enjoyed its best fortnight since 2008. It remains well below pre-referendum levels, but on Friday managed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/11/emerging-markets-currencies-trump-anxiety-bond-selloff-stock-markets-live\">push above $1.26 for the first time since early October</a>.

Debate raged over whether a big spender in the White House would boost economic activity and inflation in the world\u2019s leading economy or whether his anti-trade stance would curb growth around the globe.</span><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>There was also uncertainty over how his campaign trail rhetoric would translate into clampdowns for some sectors, such as technology companies and other internationally focused firms, and into deregulation for others, including energy and banking.</p> <p>Amid all the confusion, the pound was a a clear outperformer. Against the euro it was up 0.75% to \u20ac1.1608. </p> <p>Analysts offered various explanations for its rebound this week. \u201cThere may be some hopes that Trump\u2019s election victory could put the UK at the front of the queue for a post-Brexit trade deal with the US, although at the very least this week\u2019s events have shifted the focus away from the UK\u2019s impending departure from the EU,\u201d said Chris Saint, a senior analyst at the financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown.</p> <p>Jasper Lawler, a market analyst at the spread-betting and trading firm CMC Markets, also highlighted hopes of a UK trade deal with the US as well as other factors. \u201cOn the EU side, there is rising concern that upcoming elections, starting with the Italian referendum next month, mean it is the next target for the rise in populism,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe British pound as a top foreign-exchanges gainer this week bucks the trend of Brexit-induced weakness seen over the past few months. There\u2019s an element of simply a shift in focus behind this. The phenomenon of Donald Trump as US president-elect has put Brexit on the back-burner, allowing the pound to creep higher.\u201d<br></p> <p>On the FTSE 100 index, the pound\u2019s recovery put pressure on those companies that report in dollars. They had been bolstered in recent months from sterling\u2019s slump as it flatters their finances and also increases competitiveness for UK firms that export.</p> <p>On Friday the blue-chip index closed down 1.4%, or 97.6 points lower, at 6,730.43. Firms exposed to emerging markets were among the biggest losers as investors fretted over how Trump\u2019s anti-trade stance will hurt their prospects. </p> <p>On Wall Street, a Trump-driven rally petered out and after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/uncertainty-over-trump-policies-rattles-markets\">hitting a fresh record high on Thursday</a> the Dow Jones industrial average eased back and was bobbing around the unchanged mark during Friday afternoon trading.</p> <p>Banking shares have benefited since the Trump victory as investors reminded themselves of his campaign pledge to tear up <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/19/two-cheers-dodd-frank-act-wall-street-culture-radical-change\">Dodd Frank</a> \u2013 post-banking crisis reforms \u2013 and other regulations.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Deutsche Bank was given a fillip on hopes that the Department of Justice would accelerate its talks over a settlement for a decade-old mis-selling scandal but demand less than the initial $14bn. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/deutsche-bank-shares-slide-again-after-fresh-speculation-over-us-penalty\">Fears Deutsche cannot pay this sum have driven its shares to 30-year lows below \u20ac10</a>, although on Friday they rose by 4.6% to their highest level since late June. </p> <p>\u201cThe sweeping Republican victories on 9 November mean that some of the Democrat appointments at the US Department of Justice have only a few weeks left before they are replaced. Accelerating litigation settlements with banks may be one way to end a DoJ tenure with a sense of achievement.
