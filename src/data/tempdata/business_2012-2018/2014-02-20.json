    "webTitle": "BAE shares fall as defence firm says  US cuts will hit 2014 profits", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than \u00a31bn was wiped off the value of British defence company BAE Systems after it warned that US defence spending cuts would reduce its profits by up to 10% this year. BAE, Britain's biggest manufacturing employer, warned that US plans for $450bn (\u00a3270bn) of defence cuts over the next decade will reduce the size of its US business by 15% in 2013 and 2014. The US accounts for 44% of BAE's sales, but the company said that, together with other factors, the cuts would hit profits by between 5% and 10% this year. The warning wiped more than 8% off BAE's share price to 400p, reducing the company's market value by \u00a31.1bn to \u00a312.9bn. The arms maker has already suffered from government cuts, with pre-tax profits down 65% last year to \u00a3422m, though sales were 2% higher at \u00a318.2bn. Jordan Hiscott, of financial spread-betting firm Gekko Global Markets, said BAE's figures were \"awful\". \"As western governments withdraw their military assets and needs from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, defence cuts could become more prevalent in the sector \u2013 this is undoubtedly being highlighted in the figures this morning.\" BAE's warning comes a week after jet engine maker Rolls-Royce said government cuts will cause a \"pause in revenue and profit growth\" following a decade of increasing sales. That warning knocked more than \u00a33bn off Rolls' market value. Ian King, BAE's chief executive, said budget pressures in the company's largest markets will continue to \"prevail\" but said the firm \u2013 which makes fighter jets, drones and submarines \u2013 had made efforts to expand into new markets to offset some of the expected downturn in the US and Britain. \"We are the most global of all defence companies,\" he said. \"We have a record order book and content from outside the UK and US is growing. \"Overall, the group delivered a solid performance in 2013, against the background of reduced government spending and challenging market conditions.\" The company, which employs more than 88,000 people worldwide, said its order backlog was worth \u00a342.7bn over the medium term. On Wednesday BAE agreed a deal on the price of 72 Eurofighter Typhoon jets it is selling to Saudi Arabia following years of negotiations. King said the public is \"never going to know\" how much the Saudis are paying for the jets, which initially had a \u00a34.4bn price tag. BAE had been trying to extract more money after the Saudis requested advanced weaponry and equipment for the jets, which are being built in Warton, Lancashire. The first part of the \"cash settlement\" is expected in the next few months. He said the Gulf had become an increasingly important market for the Typhoons. More than 390 of the jets \u2013 which are built in conjunction with European aerospace group Airbus and Italian defence contractor Finmeccanica \u2013 have been delivered, mostly to European countries, and a further 571 Typhoons are on order. Bahrain, Qatar and Malaysia are considering buying the Typhoon rather than Lockheed Martin's F-35, which are made in the US, the Rafale from France's Dassault Aviation and the Gripen from Sweden's Saab. King pointed out that even if countries pick the F-35 Lightning II, BAE collects 15% of the revenue as it is a subcontractor, making parts including the crew escape and life support system. As well as maintaining the jets in the future, King said BAE will continue to supply Britain's nuclear submarine fleet and make ground vehicles for the US. \"If anyone thinks the US is not going to have an army and need combat vehicles they're crazy,\" he said. The company is also benefiting from the growing threat from cyber terrorism and cyber crime. \"Cyber is growing from both government and commercial activities,\" he said. BAE has won a five-year contract to protect Vodafone's cyber security, and King said BAE had signed a deal with other big multinationals, including banks, but was prevented from naming clients.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK homeowners and businesses should be braced for an interest rate rise around the time of next year's general election, a senior Bank of England policymaker said on Thursday in the most explicit guidance on borrowing costs yet provided by Threadneedle Street. Martin Weale, one of the nine members of the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC), said the most likely time for rates to rise from their record low of 0.5% was the spring of 2015. With the next election due to be held in May next year, Weale's comments raise the possibility that the Bank could move before the parties begin campaigning rather than wait for the new government to be chosen at the polls. Weale said in an interview with Sky News: \"I think it is very helpful if we try and explain that the most likely path for interest rates is that the first rise will come perhaps in the spring of next year. And then the path is likely to be relatively gradual.\" The Bank has held official interest rates at 0.5% since March 2009 in an attempt to help the economy recover from the deep recession of 2008-09. Despite robust growth since early 2013, Threadneedle Street has adopted a policy of forward guidance to reassure individuals and companies that dearer borrowing is not imminent. But the Bank expects a large part of the economic slack left by the recession to be used up over the coming months, and Weale confirmed City expectations that the first rate rise since mid-2007 will occur before the middle of next year. Weale did not rule out raising rates during the weeks before a dissolution of parliament. \"During an election campaign it would obviously be difficult [to change rates] but the election campaign will last for three weeks,\" he said. He added that if average earnings \u2013 which have been running below inflation for several years \u2013 were to grow more quickly than anticipated over the coming months, rates would need to go up before the spring of 2015. \"I couldn't rule out the need for a rate rise coming earlier.\" Weale, one of the four members of the MPC appointed from outside the Bank, said it was unlikely that interest rates would return to their pre-crisis levels of around 5% for the foreseeable future. In the past week, MPC members have given a series of interviews aimed at reassuring the public that rates are not about to go up. The Bank has seen the need to spell out its message after the original form of forward guidance \u2013 which involved no discussion of a rate rise until unemployment fell to 7% \u2013 was called into question by the faster than expected fall in the jobless total. Weale was the only MPC member to object to the form of guidance proposed by the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, and he said he would have been more critical if he had known what was about to happen to the labour market. \"Had I thought that there was a substantial probability that because of the movement of unemployment that [forward guidance] would have a life of less than a year then I wouldn't have been enthusiastic,\" he said. Weale expressed concern about the property market, where mortgage demand is up by a third on a year ago. \"I do worry that house prices are very elevated,\" he said. \"It's true that in inflation-adjusted terms they are probably still lower than they were in 2007 but that doesn't tell you very much because no one thought that the level of house prices in 2007 was a source of comfort.\" Weale's comments came as the CBI said there had been a marked improvement in industry's order books in the past month and that factory output had rarely been rising more strongly since its records began in 1975. Of the firms questioned, 41% said output was up over the past three months, while 17% said it had fallen. The balance of +24 points was up from +18 points in January. Anna Leach, head of economic analysis at the employers' organisation, said: \"The manufacturing sector shows continued signs of improvement with demand high and steady and output growing strongly. Growth is increasingly broad-based and firms' growth expectations are the highest for several months.\"",

He said the share issue was \"absolutely delightful news, a real vote of confidence in the business and belief in the new management team\". \"We've done the route surgery - culled unprofitable routes, redeployed aircraft and launched nine new routes.\" Flybe has also cut more than 1,000 jobs during a turnaround plan to stem losses that ran to \u00a340m in 2012-13. Hammad said the airline would develop 38 new routes over the next three years, and expand its \"white label flying\" for other airlines. He added that Flybe was in talks with several major European flag carriers about operating short-haul and regional services under their banner, a job it already does for Finnair. Flybe recently increased operations from London to the southwest of England after rail services were cut due to storms and floods, albeit with government subsidy. Hammad said that there had been \"encouraging volumes\". \"It shows a real need for our services. On 86% of our 119 routes there is no airline other than us and the alternative rail or road journey is a minimum of three hours,\" said Hammad. \"And 80% of GDP is generated in the regions. We're part of the lifeblood of these communities.\" The share issue will be formally approved at a general meeting in March.",

What can we take from this? Well, we could sit here and talk of bubbles and the early 21st Century, or we could say \u2018hey, you know what, there\u2019s value in the technology sector and this is another sign of confidence\u2019. <br></p> <p> I\u2019ll go with the latter. We are seeing a growing number of sophisticated, well funded businesses in the technology sector coming to us for advice - particularly those who are harnessing apps/Internet technology for their business model.

Watch out Silicon Valley!</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Pamela Clark-Dickson, </b>senior analyst at Informa Telecoms &amp; Media:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\ufeffWhatsApp has made a stunning exit, having been snapped up by social-networking giant Facebook for an initial US$16 billion in cash and Facebook shares, with another US$3 billion to be paid over the next four years. The deal values each of WhatsApp\u2019s 450 million monthly active users at US$42.20, and each of the company\u2019s 50 or so employees in excess of US$300 million.<br>  WhatsApp is able to command a premium by virtue of being the largest mobile messaging application in terms of monthly active users. WhatsApp was probably also in the unique position of not needing to sell, since it is able to generate revenue from its user base via a small annual subscription. <br></p> <p>Facebook\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, clearly made WhatsApp an offer that the company could not refuse. WhatsApp must also have seen Facebook as the best fit for its application, given that the company must have had other suitors \u2013 most notably, Google was rumored to have offered to buy WhatsApp US$1 billion in 2013.

Among those problems, he said, was the possibility of a new crisis originating from emerging market volatility.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\ufeffWe might have hoped that this would be the first time in five years that the G20 has met outside of a global crisis. <br></p> <p>The risk of a eurozone collapse has greatly receded, and the prospect of a destabilising standoff over the US fiscal position now looks much less likely. <br></p> <p>But as well as reasons to be cheerful, there are also reasons to be careful. Many economies in Europe remain very weak. Problems in the Middle East abound.</p> <p>And in recent months we have seen volatility in several emerging markets, with currencies weakening by up to 19%, bond yields spiking by up to 11%, and sudden falls in equities markets across Latin America and Asia.</p> <p>Most emerging markets are more robust than they were in the late 1990s, and in many cases flexible exchange rates are functioning correctly as shock absorbers.</p> <p>But if we have learnt anything from the recent Great Recession, it is that in this interconnected global economy one country\u2019s problem can very quickly become everyone else\u2019s problem.And acting early when risks emerge can head off much greater damage later on.</p> <p>My message here in Hong Kong is this: </p> <p>The risks to economic recovery have not gone away. Together we need to act now to ensure that emerging market problems don\u2019t contribute to a new crisis. </p> <p>How do we do that? By each one of us putting our own houses in order. And by using the G20 to make sure we all confront our problems instead of running away from them. </p> <p>As we meet in Australia, the G20 is more than capable of doing that; provided we focus on the important issues. But there is a danger that in Sydney and other such meetings we find ourselves distracted by a pointless debate about US and UK monetary policy\u2026</p> <p>\u2026that the G20 descends into a blame-game and we miss the opportunity to drive through, together, the reforms that are necessary to safe-guard the global recovery. </p> <p>To avoid that happening we need to understand better what the last six years have taught us about how global coordination works.</p> <p>In particular we need to understand that international coordination can work and has worked when it holds governments to account for domestic reforms, but not when it tries to impose global macroeconomic policies that are against countries\u2019 own self interests. </p> <p>Fostering domestic resilience from the bottom up is the best way to build global resilience at the top. <br></p> </blockquote> <p>Read the full speech <b><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellors-economy-speech-in-hong-kong\">here</a></b>.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-02-20T15:31:20.092Z\">at 3.31pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53060be1e4b0e0e8038da8ab\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-20T14:15:46.245Z\">2.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">BoE's Weale admits it would be 'difficult' to raise rates during an election campaign</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a408b6fa-9023-45cb-8014-00577178b1f7\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/20/1392906689479/3995bbfe-20d9-4de5-9285-1cb22cfcd6e4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bank of England logo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bank of England logo.

And then the path is likely to be relatively gradual.\u201d</p> <p>The comments indicate that the bank could be on track to raise borrowing costs before the General Election, slated for May 7, 2015.</p> <p> Mr Weale said: \u201cDuring an election campaign it would obviously be difficult (to change rates) but the election campaign will last for three weeks\u201d.</p> <p> He said that if average earnings rise more quickly than expected in the coming months, \u201cI couldn\u2019t rule out the need for a rate rise coming earlier.\u201d</p> <p>Mr Weale, who was the one MPC member to vote against forward guidance last August, said he would have been even more forceful with his resistance had he realised how wrong the bank\u2019s forecasts for unemployment were.</p> <p> \u201cHad I thought that there was a substantial probability that because of the movement of unemployment that (forward guidance) would have a life of less than a year then I wouldn\u2019t have been enthusiastic,\u201d he said.</p> <p> Mr Weale also cast doubt on the bank\u2019s calculation, published last week, that there was still 1% to 1.5% of spare capacity - meaning the extent to which the economy can grow without pushing up inflation - left in the UK.</p> <p> He said what when one bore in mind that many of those who would like to work more would earn comparatively low salaries, \u201cthe impact \u2026 is to drag down the impression you would have of the labour market output gap very considerably.\u201d</p> <p> He added that one major concern in the economy at present was the behaviour of the property market.</p> <p> \u201cI do worry that house prices are very elevated,\u201d he said.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-02-20T15:03:00.816Z\">at 3.03pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5305fd35e4b0e0e8038da891\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-20T13:07:42.446Z\">1.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK interest rates could rise next spring, MPC member says</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7fe69678-c5b8-4e97-8c59-da278563368b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/20/1392901969448/2ca74e71-b0d2-4614-a158-537b9cedce39-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Martin Weale\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Weale, a Bank of England policymaker, has warned UK households to expect in interest rate rise in spring 2015.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><b>Martin Weale</b>, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee has told Sky News interest rates will rise in spring 2015.</p> <p>He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The most likely path for interest rates is that the first rise will come perhaps in the spring of next year and the path thereafter is likely to be gradual.\ufeff</p> </blockquote> <p>It is the first time a senior Bank policymaker has given an explicit timeframe to expect the first rise in interest rates, which have been on hold at an all-time low of 0.5% since March 2009, during the aftermath of the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/statuses/436487073613512704\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Households should prepare themselves for a likely increase in interest rates &quot;next spring&quot;, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland\">@bankofengland</a> MPC member Martin Weale tells me</p>&mdash;

It was higher than January and above the long-term average but below December\u2019s level. <br></p> <p><b>Howard Archer</b>, chief UK economist at <b>IHS Global Insight</b> said the survey boded well for the first quarter of 2014 overall:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The February CBI Industrial Trends survey indicates overall that the manufacturing sector is performing pretty well in the first quarter of 2013, but has come modestly off the peak levels seen in late-2013. There are no references in the CBI survey to manufacturing activity being affected by the flooding.</p> <p>Moving forward, manufacturers will be hoping that ongoing generally good news on the UK economy fuels improved business confidence which in turn translates into improved business investment and higher demand for capital goods.</p> <p>Meanwhile, improving global growth should help UK manufacturers\u2019 export orders as 2014 progresses, although the upside for export orders may well be constrained by only gradually improving domestic demand in the eurozone. Furthermore, UK manufacturers may be hampered by sterling\u2019s strength. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-02-20T12:44:44.440Z\">at 12.44pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5305e2ffe4b07f1a00d4b0fd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-20T11:17:43.731Z\">11.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK productivity gap with G7 widest in 20 years</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The<a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/icp/international-comparisons-of-productivity/2012---final-estimates/index.html\"> Office for National Statistics </a>has delivered more gloomy news on UK productivity this morning.</p> <p>Output per worker in the UK was 25 percentage points below the average for the rest of the major G7 economies in 2012 - the widest productivity gap since 1992.

S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 1,826.92 FTSE 100: -0.18% at 6,785.54 CAC 40: -0.22% at 4,330.34 DAX 30: -1.15 at 9,549.35 IBEX: -0.042% 10,011.2 FTSE MIB: -0.53% at 20,329.67 Returning to our first story of the day, here is some more reaction to Facebook\u2019s $19bn plan to buy WhatsApp. Vanessa Barnett, technology and media partner at law firm Charles Russell: This is a clear statement of intent on the part of Facebook. $19 billion is a hefty price tag, particularly given that previously Facebook had only paid $1 billion for Instagram. What can we take from this? Well, we could sit here and talk of bubbles and the early 21st Century, or we could say \u2018hey, you know what, there\u2019s value in the technology sector and this is another sign of confidence\u2019. I\u2019ll go with the latter. We are seeing a growing number of sophisticated, well funded businesses in the technology sector coming to us for advice - particularly those who are harnessing apps/Internet technology for their business model. Global confidence in the sector bodes well for the UK. Watch out Silicon Valley! Pamela Clark-Dickson, senior analyst at Informa Telecoms &amp; Media: \ufeffWhatsApp has made a stunning exit, having been snapped up by social-networking giant Facebook for an initial US$16 billion in cash and Facebook shares, with another US$3 billion to be paid over the next four years. The deal values each of WhatsApp\u2019s 450 million monthly active users at US$42.20, and each of the company\u2019s 50 or so employees in excess of US$300 million. WhatsApp is able to command a premium by virtue of being the largest mobile messaging application in terms of monthly active users. WhatsApp was probably also in the unique position of not needing to sell, since it is able to generate revenue from its user base via a small annual subscription. Facebook\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, clearly made WhatsApp an offer that the company could not refuse. WhatsApp must also have seen Facebook as the best fit for its application, given that the company must have had other suitors \u2013 most notably, Google was rumored to have offered to buy WhatsApp US$1 billion in 2013. It remains to be seen whether, and how, Facebook will recoup its substantial investment in the app. Will Stewart from the Institution of Engineering and Technology: \ufeffObviously WhatsApp adds instant messaging to Facebook which must strengthen their position for the moment. Equally, all app types rise and fade, so established social media formats like Facebook will be overtaken by something new, and picking up candidates that might have ultimately replaced them may be a good survival strategy for a while. This does show the growing significance of mobile, though of course Facebook is on mobile anyway. But, Facebook has been around a while now so the real question is what comes next? That\u2019s it for the blog today. Thanks as ever for reading and commenting, and please do come back again tomorrow. AM The chancellor George Osborne has been speaking in Hong Kong, before traveling to Sydney to attend the first G20 meeting of finance ministers of 2014. As well as commenting that the British economy is \u201cstill too unbalanced\u201d (read our full story here), he said G20 economies should \u201cconfront our problems instead of running away from them\u201d. Among those problems, he said, was the possibility of a new crisis originating from emerging market volatility. \ufeffWe might have hoped that this would be the first time in five years that the G20 has met outside of a global crisis. The risk of a eurozone collapse has greatly receded, and the prospect of a destabilising standoff over the US fiscal position now looks much less likely. But as well as reasons to be cheerful, there are also reasons to be careful. Many economies in Europe remain very weak. Problems in the Middle East abound. And in recent months we have seen volatility in several emerging markets, with currencies weakening by up to 19%, bond yields spiking by up to 11%, and sudden falls in equities markets across Latin America and Asia. Most emerging markets are more robust than they were in the late 1990s, and in many cases flexible exchange rates are functioning correctly as shock absorbers. But if we have learnt anything from the recent Great Recession, it is that in this interconnected global economy one country\u2019s problem can very quickly become everyone else\u2019s problem.And acting early when risks emerge can head off much greater damage later on. My message here in Hong Kong is this: The risks to economic recovery have not gone away. Together we need to act now to ensure that emerging market problems don\u2019t contribute to a new crisis. How do we do that? By each one of us putting our own houses in order. And by using the G20 to make sure we all confront our problems instead of running away from them. As we meet in Australia, the G20 is more than capable of doing that; provided we focus on the important issues. But there is a danger that in Sydney and other such meetings we find ourselves distracted by a pointless debate about US and UK monetary policy\u2026 \u2026that the G20 descends into a blame-game and we miss the opportunity to drive through, together, the reforms that are necessary to safe-guard the global recovery. To avoid that happening we need to understand better what the last six years have taught us about how global coordination works. In particular we need to understand that international coordination can work and has worked when it holds governments to account for domestic reforms, but not when it tries to impose global macroeconomic policies that are against countries\u2019 own self interests. Fostering domestic resilience from the bottom up is the best way to build global resilience at the top. Read the full speech here. Sky has published a full story on Martin Weale\u2019s controversial comments. Apart from his statement that the first rise in interest rates is likely in spring 2015, some of his key points are: Rates could rise even sooner if wages growth accelerates It would be difficult to raise rates during the general election campaign, but the campaign will only last three weeks after all He would have more forcefully opposed the MPC\u2019s decision to issue forward guidance on rates [pegged to a 7% unemployment rate] had he realised how wrong the Bank\u2019s jobs forecast was The UK economy\u2019s spare capacity is probably smaller than the 1-1.5% of national income estimated by the Bank The rate of UK house price growth is a \u201cworry\u201d Extracts from Sky\u2019s story: Martin Weale, one of the nine members of the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), has given the most explicit guidance yet on when borrowing costs in Britain will rise from their current record low of 0.5%. In an exclusive interview, he said: \u201cI think it is very helpful if we try and explain that the most likely path for interest rates is that the first rise will come perhaps in the spring of next year. And then the path is likely to be relatively gradual.\u201d The comments indicate that the bank could be on track to raise borrowing costs before the General Election, slated for May 7, 2015. Mr Weale said: \u201cDuring an election campaign it would obviously be difficult (to change rates) but the election campaign will last for three weeks\u201d. He said that if average earnings rise more quickly than expected in the coming months, \u201cI couldn\u2019t rule out the need for a rate rise coming earlier.\u201d Mr Weale, who was the one MPC member to vote against forward guidance last August, said he would have been even more forceful with his resistance had he realised how wrong the bank\u2019s forecasts for unemployment were. \u201cHad I thought that there was a substantial probability that because of the movement of unemployment that (forward guidance) would have a life of less than a year then I wouldn\u2019t have been enthusiastic,\u201d he said. Mr Weale also cast doubt on the bank\u2019s calculation, published last week, that there was still 1% to 1.5% of spare capacity - meaning the extent to which the economy can grow without pushing up inflation - left in the UK. He said what when one bore in mind that many of those who would like to work more would earn comparatively low salaries, \u201cthe impact \u2026 is to drag down the impression you would have of the labour market output gap very considerably.\u201d He added that one major concern in the economy at present was the behaviour of the property market. \u201cI do worry that house prices are very elevated,\u201d he said. Martin Weale, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee has told Sky News interest rates will rise in spring 2015. He said: The most likely path for interest rates is that the first rise will come perhaps in the spring of next year and the path thereafter is likely to be gradual.\ufeff It is the first time a senior Bank policymaker has given an explicit timeframe to expect the first rise in interest rates, which have been on hold at an all-time low of 0.5% since March 2009, during the aftermath of the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers. The CBI\u2019s latest industrial trends survey suggests order books at output rose in Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector in January. Export orders improved, helped by car sales. Figures published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders on Thursday morning showed the number of cars built in the UK fell overall by 0.3% in January, but the numbers built for exports rose by 1.2% to 103,381. Anna Leach, the CBI\u2018s head of economic analysis, said: As the UK and global economies continue to strengthen over the coming months, we expect conditions to continue to improve for UK manufacturers and to increasingly feed through to business investment. Specifically, the survey of 380 manufacturers found that 26% of firms reported that total order books were above normal in February and 23% said they were below, giving a balance of +3% . It was higher than January and above the long-term average but below December\u2019s level. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight said the survey boded well for the first quarter of 2014 overall: The February CBI Industrial Trends survey indicates overall that the manufacturing sector is performing pretty well in the first quarter of 2013, but has come modestly off the peak levels seen in late-2013. There are no references in the CBI survey to manufacturing activity being affected by the flooding. Moving forward, manufacturers will be hoping that ongoing generally good news on the UK economy fuels improved business confidence which in turn translates into improved business investment and higher demand for capital goods. Meanwhile, improving global growth should help UK manufacturers\u2019 export orders as 2014 progresses, although the upside for export orders may well be constrained by only gradually improving domestic demand in the eurozone. Furthermore, UK manufacturers may be hampered by sterling\u2019s strength. The Office for National Statistics has delivered more gloomy news on UK productivity this morning. Output per worker in the UK was 25 percentage points below the average for the rest of the major G7 economies in 2012 - the widest productivity gap since 1992. Output per hour worked was 21 percentage points below the average, which was also the widest gap since 1992. Britain was outperformed in terms of productivity by the US, Canada, Germany, France and Italy, with only Japan faring worse. John Philpott, an expert on unemployment and director of independent consultancy The Jobs Economist, comments on the challenge facing the UK: \ufeffWe know UK labour productivity has been dire since the start of the recession. We now know our relative performance is even direr than first thought. Output per hour worked in 2012 was 25 percentage points below the average for the G7 major industrialised countries \u2013 the widest \u2018productivity gap\u2019 for two decades. Moreover, even though the UK economy has recovered since 2012 there is no evidence to suggest that the productivity gap is likely to have narrowed, leaving the UK still staring up the international productivity league table. According to the ONS output per hour in 2012 was 3 percentage points lower than in the pre-recession year of 2007 and would have been a whopping 16 percentage points higher had the pre-recession rate of growth been maintained. Though some of this latter growth may have been \u2018illusory\u2019 in that it was propelled by an unsustainable boom, the UK economy clearly needs in particular a strong resurgence of business investment in order to both start closing the productivity gap and to trigger a rise in real wages for people in work\u201d. European investors have not taken kindly to China\u2019s shocking manufacturing PMI published by HSBC/Markit overnight, which showed the sector shrank for a second month in February. The flash PMI fell to 48.3 in February from 49.5 in January, which was the lowest level in seven months. Anything below 50 indicates contraction. The timing of the Chinese New Year festivities, which began on 31 January, probably affected factory output as manufacturers closed for the country\u2019s biggest annual holiday according to some analysts. The world\u2019s second largest economy grew by 7.7% in 2013, but Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson said China could struggle to grow by 7.5% in 2014. A combination of the weak data from China, a slight dip in the eurozone flash PMI, and minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in the US, has sent European markets lower this morning: FTSE 100: -0.3% at 6,776.12 CAC 40: -0.33% at 4,326.71 DAX 30: -0.98% at 9,564.94 IBEX: -0.68% at 9,986.6 FTSE MIB: -1% at 20,231.30 The FOMC minutes suggested the committee will continue to slow its bond buying programme. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, had this to say: \ufeffThe minutes showed that Fed officials had few doubts about tapering asset purchases further at the January meeting. The minutes also showed that a further $10bn was more than likely in March, with only a couple of officials having reservations, and that forthcoming meetings could well see a change to the Fed\u2019s forward guidance mechanism, as the unemployment rate nears its guidance threshold. It would appear that the Fed is happy to look past the recent spate of bad data as being largely caused by the recent poor weather. You can certainly make a solid case for a slide in housing starts and building permits based on the recent weather patterns. A regional breakdown of the eurozone flash PMIs showed that again German companies are reporting a pick up in business while French firms are suffering a fall. In Germany, the private sector had the best month in February since June 2011, with strong demand boosting job creation in Europe\u2019s largest economy and allowing firms to raise prices. In France, business activity fell for a fourth month, and headcounts were cut at a faster pace than January. Markit said it represented a \u201dworrying renewed downturn in France, where malaise in the domestic economy is offsetting better export performance and suggests there is a risk of the French economy contracting again in the first quarter\u201d. The rest of the region experienced a rise in activity for a seventh month, albeit at a slowing pace. In other news, the latest flash eurozone PMI from Markit suggest private sector recovery continued in February but at a slightly slower pace than January. The headline index slipped to 52.7 from 52.9 which was a two-month low. It still points to decent growth however, with the index firmly above the 50 mark which separates contraction from expansion. The dip in the PMI was driven by the currency union\u2019s manufacturing sector, which slipped to 53 from 54 on the index in February. Production and new orders in the sector both rose, but at a slower rate than January. On the bright side, employment in the sector rose for a second month. Activity in the eurozone\u2019s services sector rose at the sharpest pace in five months, climbing to 51.7 in February from 51.6 in January. Employment in the sector fell slightly however, as growth overall was fairly sluggish. Chris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief economist, said the dip in the eurozone PMI was a reminder that \u201cthe region\u2019s recovery continues to be uneven and fragile\u201d. He added: The slight easing in growth is disappointing, but it\u2019s too early to read too much into one month\u2019s data, especially as the rate of growth of new orders picked up to its highest since mid-2011.Looking at the latest two months as a whole, the PMI suggests the region is on course to see GDP expand by up to 0.5% in the first quarter, which would be the strongest growth for three years. Unemployment looks set to remain a worry, as companies report ongoing pressure to keep headcounts down to reduce costs and boost competitiveness. Prices also continue to fall, albeit at the slowest rate for almost two years, as companies could often only generate sales via discounting. Blackberry was an instant winner after Facebook announced its $19bn plan to buy WhatsApp, with shares rising 9% in post market trading. It seems investors think the mega deal might suggest there is still some value to be gained from Blackberry - specifically through its popular Blackberry Messenger service - making it ripe for takeover. Here are some extracts from a Reuters piece: \ufeffFacebook Inc\u2019s stunning $19 billion bid for fast-growing mobile-messaging startup WhatsApp sent shares of BlackBerry Ltd surging after the closing bell on Wednesday, as investors were cheered by the lofty valuation for the messaging platform. The deal sent shares in BlackBerry up as much as 9 percent in trading after the bell because it put a rough valuation metric around the smartphone maker\u2019s own BlackBerry Messaging service. WhatsApp, with a user base of some 450 million, has grown rapidly. Its service works on Apple Inc\u2019s iOS platform, Google Inc\u2019s market-dominating Android operating system, along with devices powered by both the Windows and BlackBerry operating systems. BBM remains popular, even though BlackBerry devices have waned in popularity. Late last year, the Waterloo, Ontario-based smartphone maker finally opened the messaging platform to users of iPhones and Android devices, and the service currently has over 80 million active users. Facebook\u2019s valuation of WhatsApp translates into roughly $42 per user, and that could lead investors and analysts to rethink their valuation of the asset within BlackBerry. First a tweet from WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton back in 2009. Funny how things turn out sometimes... In a fuller statement, the 29 year old Facebook founder has outlined why he was willing to stake so much on WhatsApp. Our mission is to make the world more open and connected. We do this by building services that help people share any type of content with any group of people they want. More than 1 million people sign up for WhatsApp every day and it is on its way to connecting one billion people. WhatsApp will complement our existing chat and messaging services to provide new tools for our community. Facebook Messenger is widely used for chatting with your Facebook friends, and WhatsApp for communicating with all of your contacts and small groups of people. Since WhatsApp and Messenger serve such different and important uses, we will continue investing in both and making them each great products for everyone. WhatsApp had every option in the world, so I\u2019m thrilled that they chose to work with us. I\u2019m looking forward to what Facebook and WhatsApp can do together. I\u2019ve also known Jan for a long time, and I know that we both share the vision of making the world more open and connected. Jan and the WhatsApp team have done some amazing work to connect almost half a billion people. I can\u2019t wait for them to join Facebook and help us connect the rest of the world. WhatsApp (a pun on what\u2019s up, of course) was founded in Silicon Valley in 2009 by Jan Koum and Brian Acton, who, in their own words, are \u201ctwo guys who spent combined 20 years doing geeky stuff at Yahoo! Inc. before starting WhatsAp\u201d. The site allows you to exchange messages without the charges imposed for sending a text. For more info on what Facebook is getting for $19bn, read our piece here. Koum had this to say as the deal was announced: \ufeffWhatsApp\u2019s extremely high user engagement and rapid growth are driven by the simple, powerful and instantaneous messaging capabilities we provide. We\u2019re excited and honored to partner with Mark and Facebook as we continue to bring our product to more people around the world. Koum, 37, was born in a small village outside Kiev, Ukraine. He emigrated to the US when he was 16, moving to Mountain View, California, with his mother. After teaching himself computer networking, he enrolled at San Jose State University according to Forbes. It was in 1997 that he found himself inspecting Yahoo\u2019s advertising system, sitting opposite his future WhatsApp partner, Acton. Six months later Koum got a job himself at Yahoo, and the two became friends. In 2007 the pair left Yahoo and went traveling around South America. They shared another experience when they both applied to work at Facebook and were rejected. Koum came up with the idea for WhatsApp when he bought his first iPhone in 2009. This from Forbes: \ufeffIn January 2009, he bought an iPhone and realized that the seven-month old App Store was about to spawn a whole new industry of apps. He visited the home of Alex Fishman, a Russian friend who would invite the local Russian community to his place in West San Jose for weekly pizza and movie nights. Up to 40 people sometimes showed up. The two of them stood for hours talking about Koum\u2019s idea for an app over tea at Fishman\u2019s kitchen counter. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and business. Much excitement this morning as Facebook makes its biggest move yet - agreeing to pay $19bn (\u00a311.4bn) for mobile messaging site WhatsApp (which employs just 55 people). We will have all the detail and reaction to the deal here. In a statement announcing the deal, Facebook outlines some of the key points: Acquisition accelerates Facebook\u2019s ability to bring connectivity and utility to the world Leading mobile messaging company will continue to operate independently and retain its brand WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum to join Facebook board of directors Some facts about WhatsApp: Over 450m people use the service each month 70% of those people active on a given day Continued strong growth, currently adding more than 1 million new registered users per day. And some words from Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg: WhatsApp is on a path to connect 1 billion people. The services that reach that milestone are all incredibly valuable. I\u2019ve known Jan for a long time and I\u2019m excited to partner with him and his team to make the world more open and connected.",

Issuing a quarterly update on its performance for the first time, Britain's largest building society said it had been a \"net beneficiary\" of the seven-day switching service for current accounts which was launched in September. But Nationwide's share of current accounts remained at 6%, below its target of 10% of a market regarded as a crucial area for competition on the high street. In the nine months to the end of 2103, 20% more current accounts were opened at Nationwide than the same period the previous year, amid anecdotal evidence that it has benefited from the problems at the Co-operative Bank. The bank is no longer majority-owned by the Co-operative Group after being rescued by bondholders, including US hedge funds. The switching service is intended to bolster competition in the retail banking sector, dominated by the big four \u2013 Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays. The society, based in Swindon, Wiltshire, reported net mortgage lending - \u2013 which strips out loans being repaid \u2013 of \u00a38.4bn, the same amount as the whole of the previous financial year. It took a 75% share of the net lending market for mortgages, where activity in general has been bolstered by the help to buy and funding for lending schemes. \"We are punching above our weight in all of our principal marketplaces. We're more than holding our own against the established banking models,\" the society's chief executive, Graham Beale, told Reuters. \"Through the current account transfer process, we are gaining three times more customers than we are losing.\" The trading update was required from Nationwide after it issued a new type of financial instrument known as core capital deferred shares (CCDS) to bolster its financial strength as an alternative to shares that banks are able to sell to investors. As a result of the issue, the society is on track to hit a target for its leverage ratio (a measure of financial risks and capital strength) of 3% before the end of 2015 deadline set by the Bank of England's prudential regulation authority (PRA). Since the issue of the CCDS in November the leverage ratio has improved from 2.3% to 2.6%. Barclays was forced to tap its shareholders for \u00a35.8bn of cash last year after being set the leverage target. Beale said: \"This trading performance translates into a strong set of financial results with underlying profit up 105% to \u00a3539. Retained earnings, together with the successful issuance of capital in December 2013, have further strengthened our capital ratios and we are significantly ahead of the plans agreed with the PRA last year.\"",

    "webTitle": "UK productivity gap with developed nations now widest for 20 years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's productivity gap with its main developed country rivals is at its widest in 20 years, following the flat-lining of the economy after the deep recession of 2008-09. International comparisons released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that output per hour worked in the UK is 21% lower than the average for the other six members of the G7 \u2013 the US, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada. The ONS said this was the biggest productivity shortfall since 1992, and that on an alternative measure \u2013 output per worker \u2013 the gap was 25%. Poor productivity has been blamed for the lack of earnings growth and the squeeze on real incomes in Britain over the past five years, though the Bank of England is expecting output per worker to pick up during 2014. John Philpott, director of the consultancy the Jobs Economist, said: \"We know UK labour productivity has been dire since the start of the recession. We now know our relative performance is even direr than first thought.\" During the 1990s and 2000s, Britain closed the gap with the other G7 nations to less than 10%, but in the years since the 2007 financial crisis weak output and a smaller loss of jobs than in previous recessions has led to a marked worsening in Britain's productivity record. The ONS said the UK productivity deficit was most pronounced in comparison with the US, Germany and France, where the gap was now more than 30%. By contrast, British workers produced 11% more per hour than their Japanese counterparts and lagged behind those in Canada and Italy by five and 11 points respectively. Productivity tends to increase over time as new technology and better skills make economies more efficient. But the ONS said output per worker in 2012 was 3% lower than it had been five years earlier and 16% below the level that might have been expected, had its previous upward trend not been interrupted by the most severe slump of the postwar era. Moreover, even though the UK economy has recovered since 2012, there is no evidence to suggest that the productivity gap is likely to have narrowed, leaving the UK still staring up the international productivity league table. Philpott said that some of the productivity improvements during the pre-recession period may have been illusory because they were the result of an unsustainable boom. He added: \"The UK economy clearly needs, in particular, a strong resurgence of business investment in order to both start closing the productivity gap and to trigger a rise in real wages for people in work.\" The Bank of England has cited improved productivity as a key factor in whether wage growth surpasses inflation in the second half of the year, which would ease the pressure on household budgets. Last week the Bank governor, Mark Carney, said: \"We are not complacent about this recovery at all. We are serene but not complacent. We need to see productivity come in to validate wage expectations.\" Data published this week shows that wage growth rose from 0.9% to 1% in January, narrowing the gap with the CPI rate of inflation, which dipped from 2% to 1.9%. Some economists said the latest inflation figures indicated a downward trend in prices that could mean above-inflation wage growth for the first time since 2010. \"This should enable real earnings to rise,\" said Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics. According to ONS figures published last month, living standards have suffered their most prolonged decline since 1964. Productivity was again cited as an important component of the consistent fall in real wages since 2010. \"It seems likely that a key driver is the response to the fall in productivity in 2008 and 2009, and its subsequent weakness,\" the ONS said. Describing a series of \"step-changes\" in annual real wage growth, the ONS pointed to average growth of 2.9% in the 1970s and 1980s, then growth of 1.5% in the 1990s, 1.2% in the 2000s, and then -2.2% since the beginning of this decade.",

The release of the data also came on a day when the Canberra Times reported that commonwealth public servants \u201cface a choice of zero pay rises for three years or deep cuts to their entitlements under the Abbott government\u2019s aggressive new approach to its employees\u201d. Abetz will then be happy to know that the public sector is also experiencing record low wages growth. And for ACT public sector workers (of whom the vast majority work for the commonwealth), their wages growth of 2.2% is the lowest since 2000 and is 0.4 percentage points below the national rate.
