      "bodyText": "The UK economy has shown signs of picking up over recent weeks as strong demand from overseas helped offset moribund consumer spending at home, according to a survey that will welcomed by Theresa May\u2019s government as next month\u2019s election approaches. News that Britain\u2019s services sector enjoyed its fastest growth for four months in April follows surveys earlier this week signalling similar improvements for the smaller manufacturing and construction industries. Together they will soothe fears around the UK economic outlook after official figures showed GDP growth slowed markedly in the first quarter. But behind the positive headlines there were continued signs that consumers are reining in spending as the Brexit-hit pound stokes inflation. Hotels and restaurants were among the consumer-facing businesses feeling those effects in April, the services report showed. The main business activity reading on the Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI report (pdf) rose to 55.8 in April from 55.0 in March. That was well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and confounded forecasts for a dip to 54.5 in a Reuters poll of economists. Job creation also picked up, according to the survey, which excludes government services and retail but still covers half of the overall services sector. It found services were confident about their prospects for growth over the year, although the degree of optimism moderated for the third month running. The survey compilers also noted that in the face of rising costs, companies were putting up their prices at the fastest pace since July 2008, adding to pressures on consumers. Costs have risen due to higher crude oil prices and because the pound\u2019s drop since the Brexit vote makes imports more expensive. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at the PMI report compilers, IHS Markit, said the polls for services, construction and manufacturing together pointed to GDP growth accelerating at the start of the second quarter. \u201cWhile we expect consumer spending to slacken in coming months, with the April survey highlighting continued weakness in sectors such as hotels, restaurants and other household-facing businesses, there\u2019s good reason to believe that at least 0.4% GDP growth can be achieved in the second quarter as a whole,\u201d he said. In the first quarter, GDP growth slowed to 0.3% from 0.7% in the final three months of 2016. The services report said April\u2019s pick-up in activity was partly down to resilient business-to-business demand, which includes activity such as a firm hiring legal or consultancy services. There was also support from new product launches and, in some cases, another rise in sales to overseas clients. The authors said new business expanded at a faster pace in April and that \u201canecdotal evidence from survey respondents suggested that greater business-to-business sales had helped to offset subdued discretionary consumer spending\u201d. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said the survey \u201cprobably overstates the buoyancy of growth\u201d, noting that it excludes the retail sector, which has been hurt by weaker consumer spending in recent months. \u201cPretty much everyone is expecting growth to slow this year because of a weakening consumer,\u201d he added. \u201cStill, I\u2019d be minded to think that GDP rebounds a little bit into the second quarter, probably up from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter to 0.4-0.5% quarter-on-quarter during the second quarter.\u201d The reports will provide more mixed signals for the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee to debate when it meets to set interest rates and publish its latest forecasts for the UK economy next week. The Bank, under governor Mark Carney, has repeatedly said it faces a trade-off between keeping inflation under control and supporting growth and jobs. Most economists have taken that as a signal interest rates will be held at their record low of 0.25% well beyond the end of this year. But one member voted against the other eight at the last meeting, calling for a rate rise. \u201cThe MPC likely will place much more weight at next week\u2019s meeting on the weak official data for the first quarter than on April\u2019s better PMIs, and we expect Kristin Forbes to remain alone in voting to raise interest rates,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. Figures from the Bank, also published on Thursday, hinted at a slowdown in consumer spending and confidence. They showed approvals for mortgages dipped to a six month low in March, the latest sign of a softening housing market. Consumer borrowing also grew at a slower annual pace.",

    "webTitle": "UK car sales drop by a fifth after tax changes and price rises", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Car sales tumbled in April at the sharpest rate since 2010 as government cuts to subsidies for green cars and a rise in prices hit the market for new vehicles. New car registrations fell month on month by almost 20% to 152,076 units as demand for electric and hybrid vehicles fell for the first time in almost four years. Analysts said the 19.8% fall was a huge blow to the industry which has boomed since 2014 and underpinned the UK\u2019s recovery. Howard Archer, the chief economist at IHS Global Insight, warned that the incentive to bring forward purchases to March could mean that month proved to be the industry\u2019s \u201clast hurrah\u201d. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said an average 2.9% annual rise in prices, ahead of the average 2.3% inflation rate, could put the industry on a downward trend for the rest of the year. He added that consumers were finding it tougher to secure unsecured credit from lenders, \u201cand the fall in consumer confidence and squeeze on real wages is making households reluctant to commit to big ticket purchases\u201d. Diesel cars were the biggest fallers, prompted by the continued threat of higher duties and potential bans from city centres. Tombs said company fleet car buyers, who have propped up the market since the Brexit vote last year, continued to provide all the momentum while private car buying slumped. \u201cPrivate car registrations plunged in April because vehicle excise duty rose sharply for cars purchased after April 1,\u201d he said. Most buyers would have been about \u00a3400 better off over the three years by buying a low-emission car before the tax hike, although the exact savings vary according to the vehicle\u2019s emissions and price. It meant that registrations rose 8.4% year-over-year in March to mark the busiest month of the year for car purchases, indicating that the tax change substantially influenced behaviour. Under the new system lower-emission models, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids, will pay between \u00a310 and \u00a3100 in first-year excise duty after previously being exempt. All low-emission vehicles other than those with zero emissions will face a flat \u00a3140 annual charge in subsequent years. Car sales have supported the UK\u2019s economic recovery since 2014 when fuel prices, which surged after the financial crash, dropped by more than half. Double-digit growth in subsequent years, further helped by cheap finance deals, has proved to be a significant element of GDP growth. Carmakers have warned the Brexit vote could force some of them to move production facilities out of the country should the UK fail to secure a favourable trade deal. Analysts have also said the fall in the pound, which makes imports more expensive, was likely to lead to higher prices and depress demand. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which collects the data, said the industry remained upbeat since the average for the first four months of 2017 still showed a 1.1% gain on last year to a record sales figure of 972,092. Sue Robinson, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, said the slump was not a surprise. \u201cApril is always one of the weakest months for new retail but with record low interest rates and record high employment levels consumer demand remains high,\u201d she said. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the market remains at record levels as customers still see many benefits in purchasing a new car. We therefore expect demand to stabilise over the year as the turbulence created by these tax changes decreases.\u201d Archer said while cars remained an essential purchase for many consumers, the industry should expect them to trade down to cheaper models or delay purchases once their buying power is diluted by rising inflation and muted earnings growth. \u201cInflation has risen to reach 2.3% in March and is set to go higher still, while earnings growth was limited to 2.3% in the three months to February. Regular annual average earnings growth was even softer at 2.2% in the three months to February,\u201d he said. \u201cThe serious concern for the car sector is that it looks highly probable the fundamentals for consumers will weaken markedly further over the coming months, as rising inflation eats further into purchasing power with the squeeze reinforced by muted earnings growth. It is also very possible that consumers will face a weakening labour market.\u201d",

Analysts have also said the fall in the pound, which makes imports more expensive, was likely to lead to higher prices and depress demand.</p> <p>The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which collects the data, said the industry remained upbeat since the average for the first four months of 2017 still showed a 1.1% gain on last year to a record sales figure of 972,092.<br></p> <p>Sue Robinson, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, said the slump was not a surprise. \u201cApril is always one of the weakest months for new retail but with record low interest rates and record high employment levels consumer demand remains high,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the market remains at record levels as customers still see many benefits in purchasing a new car. We therefore expect demand to stabilise over the year as the turbulence created by these tax changes decreases.\u201d</p> <p>Archer said while cars remained an essential purchase for many consumers, the industry should expect them to trade down to cheaper models or delay purchases once their buying power is diluted by rising inflation and muted earnings growth. </p> <p>\u201cInflation has risen to reach 2.3% in March and is set to go higher still, while earnings growth was limited to 2.3% in the three months to February. Regular annual average earnings growth was even softer at 2.2% in the three months to February,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe serious concern for the car sector is that it looks highly probable the fundamentals for consumers will weaken markedly further over the coming months, as rising inflation eats further into purchasing power with the squeeze reinforced by muted earnings growth. It is also very possible that consumers will face a weakening labour market.\u201d <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Are you ready for \u201c\u00a35.05.05.17\u201d, as the Bank of England has snappily dubbed it? Friday 5 May is when paper \u00a35 notes officially cease to be legal tender, and the plastic fiver takeover is complete. So what\u2019s happening? The Bank of England is withdrawing the paper \u00a35 note, which features a portrait of Elizabeth Fry on the reverse and was introduced in 2002, following the introduction last autumn of the new polymer fiver featuring Sir Winston Churchill. Can I still spend the paper ones? Technically you have only a few hours left. On 5 May they lose their legal tender status, and after that retailers and the public no longer have to accept them as payment or in change. \u201cSome retailers, banks and building societies may continue to accept paper \u00a35 notes for a short period of time after withdrawal. However, this is at the discretion of the individual organisation,\u201d says the Bank. There are probably quite a few knocking about \u2013 as recently as the start of April there were still 160m of them in wallets, purses, pockets and money boxes. What do I do if I find a paper fiver after 5 May? The good news is that all Bank of England notes retain their face value \u201cfor all time\u201d. If you can\u2019t find anyone who will accept your notes, they can be taken to a Post Office or exchanged with the Bank of England in London, either by post or in person. This service is free of charge. The address is: Department NEX, Bank of England, Threadneedle Street, London EC2R 8AH. If you are doing it by post, there is a form to fill in first. Why has the paper \u00a35 been withdrawn? The Bank of England says it regularly reviews and updates its notes to take advantage of advances in banknote design and security. Polymer is a thin, flexible plastic, and notes made out of this are stronger than their paper counterparts. Each new polymer note is expected to last at least 2.5 times longer than the paper notes. The Bank says that because of this, they are \u201cbetter for the environment\u201d, as it means printing fewer notes, which in turn means less energy is used in manufacturing and cash transportation. And when a polymer note has reached the end of its life, it will be recycled. The Bank says these notes are also \u201ccleaner\u201d than paper ones, as they are more resistant to dirt and moisture. In addition, the new notes incorporate extra security measures designed to foil counterfeiters. However, they are smaller than their predecessors: 125mm by 65mm, compared with 135mm by 70mm for the Fry fivers. What\u2019s happening with other notes? A new polymer \u00a310 note will be issued in September, and a new polymer \u00a320 note by 2020. The current \u00a350 note was issued in 2011 and at present there are no plans to replace it. And what about the old \u00a31 coin? Following the introduction of the new \u00a31 coin in March, the legal tender status of the old \u201cround pounds\u201d will be withdrawn on 15 October. Until then, both can be used in shops. What about Scotland? In Scotland, leading banks started issuing their own polymer fivers last autumn, and since then they have gradually been withdrawing the paper version \u2013 however, there is no specific published final end date. (There are no plans by note issuers in Northern Ireland to switch to polymer.)",

      "bodyText": "Fashion chain Next has delivered another gloomy profit and sales forecast, highlighting tough trading conditions for UK retailers as rising inflation pushes up prices and consumer spending weakens. The retailer, run by Lord Wolfson, cut its sales and profit guidance for 2017 in a trading update on Thursday, citing challenging trading conditions. Next posted a 2.5% drop in total sales in the 13 weeks to 29 April. Store sales slumped by 8.1% \u2013 a performance described as \u201cdismal\u201d by analysts. Directory sales, made up of online and catalogue sales, have fared better than retail sales for some time, and were up 3.3% in the latest quarter. Some of Next\u2019s problems are of its own making. In March, the retailer reported its first fall in annual profits for eight years and said it had failed to stock enough wardrobe staples while chasing a more fashionable image. Next said: \u201cThe UK consumer environment remains challenging, particularly in the clothing and homeware markets, and real wage growth is now close to zero.\u201d As investors took fright, Next was the biggest faller in early trading on the FTSE 100, before the share price rallied to around the \u00a342 mark, a decline of about 4.5%. The company\u2019s share price has fallen nearly 50% since briefly touching \u00a380 during October 2015. Wolfson has admitted mistakes were made during a push to speed up the time it takes to get clothes from the design stage to the stores, in an effort to compete with rivals such as Zara, H&amp;M and Primark. This led to some of Next\u2019s bestselling \u201cheartland products\u201d missing from its ranges. It relies on selling large volumes of easy-to-wear basics for families with young children, but was more focused on getting trend-led items to its stores last year. The firm reiterated it would not be able to plug the gaps in its collections until September. \u201cWe said we expected some improvements from May onwards, but that our ranges would not be where we wanted them to be until the autumn season in September,\u201d Next said. \u201cWe still believe this to be the case.\u201d Analysts at UBS estimated Next\u2019s first-quarter retail sales dropped more than 10% on a like-for-like basis, and were down about 20% over the past three years. \u201cWe assume retail like-for-like sales are less negative in the second half as ranges improve, and with weak comparative figures from the hot weather in the third quarter,\u201d they said. The Office for National Statistics reported that UK retail sales fell 1.4% in the first three months of 2017, the biggest quarterly fall since 2010. Analysts have said consumers were less willing to spend now the impact of weaker sterling was translating into higher shop prices. The pound is 14% lower against the dollar than it was on the day of the referendum in June when the UK voted to leave the European Union. Next has been hit hard by the collapse in the pound, which has pushed up the cost of imported materials. It raised its prices on the spring and summer ranges by 4%, on average. Prices on the autumn and winter ranges are set to be 4% to 5% higher than last year. Emily Stella, a senior analyst at consultancy GlobalData, described 2017 as a \u201cpivotal year\u201d for Next as it tackles an \u201cextremely tough clothing market\u201d and strengthening online competition. George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cWhichever way it turns, Next just can\u2019t seem to catch a break at the moment. Online competition is ratcheting up, weaker sterling is increasing costs, and conditions on the UK high street are far from favourable. \u201cThe positive to hold on to is that Next has historically been an exceptionally well-run business, and many of those who have contributed to its success are still on board. Investors will be hoping this raft of experience will help chief executive Lord Wolfson steer the ship through these choppy waters.\u201d The company cut its pre-tax profit forecast to \u00a3680m to \u00a3740m for the year to January 2018, from a previous estimate of \u00a3680m to \u00a3780m. The mid point would mean a 10% drop in profits, following a 5.5% fall to \u00a3790m in the last financial year. Next also reduced its sales estimates. At the upper end, sales are only expected to grow by 0.5% rather than the previously estimated 2.5%, while the bottom estimate, a drop of 3.5%, is unchanged. Ernesto Bisagno, senior analyst at Moody\u2019s and lead analyst for Next, said the figures were weaker than he had expected, \u201cespecially in light of the strong retail sales growth in March for the UK textile industry as a whole\u201d. As well as bringing back more wardrobe staples, Next is experimenting with ways of making its stores more attractive places to shop. It rented out space in its largest store, in Manchester\u2019s Arndale centre, to a prosecco bar, a hair salon and a florist. The company has also scaled back planned pay rises for some senior staff. Wolfson\u2019s salary will rise 1% to \u00a3773,000 this year.",

    "webTitle": "UK service sector growth hits four-month high, but car sales slump \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap. 1) Britain\u2019s economy looks healthier than a few days ago. Growth in the dominant service sector has hit a four-month high this morning, following similar strong data from the manufacturing and construction sector this week. 2) The car industry, though, seems to have hit a bump. Sales slumped by 20% last month, after buyers scrambled to buy new cars in March before tax changes hit. 3) The eurozone recovery looks intact; service sector growth roared to a six-year high last month. Firms reported a rise in demand, encouraging them to take on more staff. 4) The euro has strengthened, as have French bonds, as Emmanuel Macron remained the favourite to win Sunday\u2019s presidential election. Macron has just picked up an endorsement from Barack Obama, while Le Pen is being backed by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage... 5) In the City, shares in Next have fallen sharply after the retailer cut its profit forecasts and warned that conditions are tough. HSBC is having a better day, though, up 3% after beating profit forecasts. 6) Commodity prices are also under pressure, with oil hitting a five-month low today. David Morrison of SpreadCo explains why: There\u2019s been no let-up in the rout in crude oil today. The benchmark WTI contract is down close to 2.5% this afternoon while Brent has slumped below $50. Both contracts trading at their lowest levels since late November last year, just after OPEC and other major producers agreed to their 1.8 million barrel per day output cut. Today\u2019s sell-off accelerated after Russia said that there\u2019s no decision to date on extending the production cut beyond June. That may be all for today, unless anything huge happens. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Over in New York, the stock market has opened cautiously as traders await another vote in Congress over healthcare. The Dow Jones industrial average is up just 20 points, or 0.1%. Republicans claim they have enough votes to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act introduced under President Obama. But it could be close.... Here\u2019s more reaction to today\u2019s decent UK service sector data, from Kathleen Brooks of City Index: The UK service sector has caught up with the manufacturing sector, and today\u2019s PMI data for April suggests that the UK economy will rebound once more in Q2, after a disappointing start to the year. This has been greeted by a bounce higher in the pound, although GBP/USD hasn\u2019t been able to sustain gains above 1.2900 so far. As we move into election season, the UK economy is playing into Theresa May\u2019s hands, which could help to reduce political uncertainty as we lead up to the General Election next month. This is significant for UK assets, particularly the pound, which has been very sensitive to UK political risk post-Brexit. Thus, an easy win for Theresa May next month combined with a pick-up in UK economic data could help GBP/USD break through the 1.30 barrier in the coming weeks. As we lead up to the election on June 8th June, UK economic data will be just as important as the polls for traders to keep an eye on. The oil price is taking a kicking today, hitting its lowest level since last December. Brent crude is down 1.9% at $49.84, a five-month low, while US oil fell below $47 per barrel. This comes after figures yesterday showed US oil inventories are higher than expected, suggesting weaker demand. Reuters explains: U.S. data showed crude inventories fell 930,000 barrels in the week to April 28, against analysts\u2019 expectations for a decrease of 2.3 million barrels. Stocks have steadily declined for the last four weeks, but at 527.8 million barrels they are just 7 million barrels off a record high. There\u2019s also concern that the OPEC cartel might not extend their deal to cut production. That agreement expires in June, although it could be extended at a meeting later this month..... Two pieces of US economic data just flashed up. 1) America\u2019s trade deficit was smaller than expected in March. The gap between US imports and exports came in at $43.7bn, close to February\u2019s $43.8bn, and lower than the $44.5bn expected. Imports fell by 0.7% during the month, while exports shrank by 0.9%. America\u2019s politically sensitive trade gap with China widened by 7%, though. That may be because trade patterns returned to normal after the Chinese New Year holidays. 2) The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefit fell unexpectedly last week. Just 238,000 people applied for unemployment benefit last week, down from 257,000. That\u2019s lower than expected, showing how the US labour market remains strong. Optimism over Sunday\u2019s French election continues to bubble through Europe\u2019s financial markets today. The euro has risen almost half a cent against the US dollar to $1.0922, and French bonds have also strengthened. Traders are concluding that Emmanuel Macron has cleared one of the last hurdles between him and the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, having survived last night\u2019s debate with Marine Le Pen relatively unscathed. Taxi driver are a popular weathervane on these occasions, and Politico\u2019s Nicholas Vinocur has found one who has switched to Macron. Sunday\u2019s election will still be a major event, though, as a surprise Le Pen victory would shake the markets and herald a new phase of euro crisis. Barclays will have extra sales and trading staff at work around the globe this weekend, while its research team will also provide 24-hour coverage for clients. A spokesperson says: Barclays will have extra Sales and Trading staff in our offices in New York, London and Singapore, in order to help our clients navigate through any ensuing market volatility as the French election second round results come in.\u201d As the eurozone basks in the sun of nascent economic recovery, in Athens prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been blasting Greece\u2019s euro zone partners (and IMF) for their unfriendly behaviour towards the bloc\u2019s weakest link. Helena Smith reports from Athens Just days after a landmark agreement with them, Alexis Tsipras has resorted to some of his language of yore to describe the international creditors keeping debt-stricken Greece afloat. Addessing his cabinet this morning the leftist leader slammed the economic \u201cmodel\u201d the eurozone and IMF had elected to inflict on Greece. Tsipras declared: \u201cThe lenders are not our friends. And nor did they become our friends in June 2015, or May 2016 or now. \u201cAnd that is not just a moral judgement. It is the reality. On the one hand, lenders want to secure the money that they loaned Greece, on the other they want [to impose] a particular model and strategy of organising the economy. This model very often clashes with the one that we want for the country, for the economy, to cover social needs.\u201d The Greek prime minister then went on to defend the way his government had negotiated the latest bailout review saying it was precisely because it was not prepared to agree to measures \u201cat any cost\u201d that it had negotiated so hard. The agreement, which foresee Athens applying yet more punitive pension cuts and tax increases come 2019, has been criticised by leading figures in Tsipras\u2019 ruling Syriza party - although it also pays the way to much-need possible debt relief. The concessionary measures will be put before the 300-seat parliament later this month so that the deal can be finalized \u2013 and emergency funds disbursed \u2013 at the next meeting of euro group finance ministers on May 22. Greece faces major debt repayment worth \u20ac7.5bn on July 7th. City traders are continuing to thump Next, following the retailer\u2019s downbeat trading update this morning (details here). Here\u2019s the full story: Today\u2019s car registration figures also show that sales of diesel-powered cars plunged by 27% year-on-year in April. That may show that recent pollution scandals (yes you, Volkswagen) and new taxes on high-emitting vehicles are spooking drivers. Shaun Armstrong, managing director of online car finance provider Creditplus.co.uk says: Buyers have been spooked by the planned introduction of a toxin tax on diesel cars and the London Mayor Sadiq Khan announcing an additional charge on polluting diesel vehicles entering central London. \u201cTheresa May then showed her disdain for diesel by hinting that the Government is considering introducing a scrappage scheme to incentivise drivers to trade in older diesel vehicles.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story about the sharp fall in car sales in April: This chart highlights how UK services firms hiked their prices in April, as the inflationary impact of the weaker pound ripples through the economy. And this one shows how bosses are a little less optimistic than in March (although still fairly upbeat): We\u2019ve also got fresh evidence that Britain\u2019s housing market is slowing. Mortgage approvals fell to a six-month low of 66,837 in March, down from 67,936 in February. That\u2019s a weaker reading than expected, and the second monthly fall in a row. Recent surveys have shown that price growth has slowed recently, suggesting the market is cooling as real wage growth slows. The UK services sector had a \u201cstellar\u201d April, says Duncan Brock of Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. However, growth is being driven by orders from other companies - rather than the public, he adds: \u201cA supportive economic backdrop helped to boost the UK service sector, with resilient demand reported both at home and from abroad. Going full steam ahead with staff hires rising at one of the fastest rates since last summer, this relieved capacity pressures and provides a signal that service providers anticipate additional growth in the coming months. \u201cThe driver of growth came primarily from business clients, as consumers took a back seat, uneasy about rising costs for essentials such as food, fuel and energy which rose at the fastest rate since July 2008. Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, is encouraged that Britain\u2019s services PMI hit a four-month high in April. But....he\u2019s also concerned that prices rose so sharply; this could hit economic growth this year. \u201cAlthough the services PMI beat expectations, some of the details give pause for thought. Input costs continue to point to higher inflation in the months ahead, a factor that is likely to weigh on consumers. Furthermore, although firms\u2019 optimism about the year ahead is still positive, it fell for the third consecutive month. \u201cNevertheless, the figures continue to point to the economy expanding in the current quarter, something that will provide the PM with some comfort going into the General Election and the Brexit negotiations soon after. However, an interesting nuance in the data at the moment is that surveys signal a greater sense of growth than the hard data \u2013 though markets are unlikely to be bothered this. But there\u2019s bad news too..... service sector companies are hiking prices at the fastest race since July 2008. Firms argue that they had to raise prices, because they\u2019ve been hit by higher costs themselves. Markit reports: UK service providers indicated a strong rise in input costs during April, despite the rate of inflation easing to a seven-month low. This was mostly linked to higher utility bills, full costs, salary payments and food prices. As a result, average prices charged by services firms increased at a robust pace that was the fastest recorded since July 2008. We\u2019ve now had a hat-trick of good UK economic data this week, as economist Rupert Seggins tweets: (however, these PMI reports are only \u2018soft data\u2019, rather than \u2018hard data\u2019 like an actual GDP report) Britain\u2019s economy seems to have picked up speed, after growth slowed to just 0.3% in January-March. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says: \u201cThe upturn in the services PMI rounds off a hat- trick of good news after upside surprises to both the manufacturing and construction PMIs. The three surveys collectively point to GDP growing at a rate of 0.6% at the start of the second quarter. \u201cWhile we expect consumer spending to slacken in coming months, with the April survey highlighting continued weakness in sectors such as hotels, restaurants and other household-facing businesses, there\u2019s good reason to believe that at least 0.4% GDP growth can be achieved in the second quarter as a whole. Breaking! Growth in Britain\u2019s service sector has hit a four-month high. Markit\u2019s Service Sector PMI has jumped to 55.8 in April, up from 55.0 in March, and the highest reading this year. That signals stronger growth last month in the dominant sector of the UK economy. Markit says that service sector firms enjoyed \u201ca sustained rebound in business activity during April, supported by the fastest upturn in new work so far in 2017.\u201d Job creation also hit a four-month high, as companies struggled to handle the increased demand. Service sector bosses are also confident about growth prospects over the next 12 months, Markit adds. Here\u2019s the key facts: More to follow! Eek! UK new car registrations tumbled by almost 20% in April as new tax changes hit the sector. That includes a 28% slide in private car sales, suggesting that consumer are reining themselves in. It\u2019s a complicated picture, though, as new tax changes came into force last month. The new Vehicle Excise Duty rules made it much more expensive to run certain cars, sparking a jump in sales in March. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, says: With the rush to register new cars and avoid VED tax rises before the end of March, as well as fewer selling days due to the later Easter, April was always going to be much slower. It\u2019s important to note that the market remains at record levels as customers still see many benefits in purchasing a new car. We therefore expect demand to stabilise over the year as the turbulence created by these tax changes decreases.\u201d And here\u2019s economist Sam Tombs: April\u2019s strong PMIs suggest that the eurozone recovery picked up speed last month, says Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: \u201cWith the final reading coming in slightly above the earlier flash estimate, the PMI surveys portray an economy that is growing at an encouragingly robust pace and that risks are moving from the downside to a more balanced situation. \u201cThe April Eurozone PMI is historically consistent with a GDP growth rate of 0.7%, with similar rates of expansion signalled for both Germany and France. Even faster gains are being indicated in Spain and Ireland and Italy is also seeing growth perk up, highlighting the increasingly broad-based nature of the current upturn. The eurozone grew by 0.5% in the first three months of this year. If growth really does accelerate to 0.7%, talk of a \u2018Euro boom\u2019 might not seem too daft. Boom! The eurozone\u2019s private sector has just reported its strongest growth since the debt crisis began in 2011. Markit\u2019s \u2018composite output index\u2019, which tracks thousands of companies across the region, has jumped to 56.8 in April, up from 56.4 in March. That\u2019s based on today\u2019s strong services PMIs, plus Tuesday\u2019s equally strong manufacturing data. A surge in new business helped companies to boost their output by the fastest rate in 72 months, says Markit. Underpinning growth of economic activity was a strong increase in incoming new business. New orders rose for the twenty-ninth month running, with the rate of expansion staying close to March\u2019s high. The outlook for the economy also remained relatively bright in April, with business optimism about levels of output in one year\u2019s time staying close to March\u2019s series-record high. Rising backlogs of work also suggested that new order growth was sufficiently robust to test capacity and provide a buffer of incomplete work. Encouragingly, firms also reported a rise in employment levels in April. Markit explains: Although the rate of job creation slowed, it was still one of the best seen over the past decade. Accelerated workforce growth in Spain and Ireland partly offset slower increases in Germany and Italy. Ditto Germany. Its services PMI has hit a two-month low of 55.4, down from 55.6 in March. That\u2019s better than the earlier \u2018flash\u2019 estimate and still shows solid growth. France\u2019s services PMI has missed forecasts, but remains comfortably in \u2018growth\u2019 territory (ie, over 50). Wow! Italy\u2019s service sector grew at its fastest pace in almost a decade. The Italian services PMI has jumped to 56.2, showing pretty strong growth, up from 52.9 in March. Markit says: The strong growth was driven by rising demand, which also led to the creation of more jobs as capacity pressures intensified. Another sign that Europe\u2019s economy is having a pretty decent year.... Optimism that Emmanuel Macron will beat Marine Le Pen to the French presidency is pushing shares higher, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index. She writes: French Presidential favourite Macron was considered to have outperformed Marine Le Pen in the final Presidential debate in France last night. This has helped to boost equity markets in Europe and we have also seen a drop in French bond yields, suggesting that political risk premia is falling sharply ahead of the second round of the French election on Sunday. Interestingly, an opinion poll has also suggested that Macron\u2019s En Marche! party could claim a large share of seats in the French Assembly in June.... Ol\u00e9! Spain\u2019s services sector has posted strong growth last month. The Spanish services PMI has jumped to 57.8, signalling the fastest growth rate since August 2015, according to data firm Markit. Spanish companies reported a \u201csharp increases\u201d in activity and new business, meaning they took on more staff to tackle higher workloads. Markit says: April survey data pointed to further sharp monthly rises in activity and new business in the Spanish service sector. Higher workloads encouraged firms to expand their operating capacity, and to this end employment increased to the greatest extent in nine months. Companies generally expect these trends to be sustained, supporting further optimism around the 12-month outlook. Over in Paris, the CAC 40 index has hit its highest level since 2008. French bonds are also rallying, after Emmanuel Macron was judged to have outperformed Marine Le Pen in a notably ill-tempered and hostile TV debate last night: High street chain Next has cut its growth and profit forecasts, in the latest sign that Britain\u2019s retail sector is struggling. In a downbeat trading update, Next warned that: The UK consumer environment remains challenging, particularly in the clothing and homeware markets, and real wage growth is now close to zero. Sales of full-price items at Next\u2019s shops has fallen by over 8% in the last three months; a sign that shoppers are cutting back in the face of higher inflation. It now expects to make profits of between \u00a3680m and \u00a3740m this year, down from a previous range of \u00a3680m to \u00a3780m. This has sent Next shares slumping by 5%, the worst performer on the FTSE 100. Banking giant HSBC has also beaten City expectations. Pre-tax profits in the first quarter came in at $5bn, comfortably ahead of the $4.3bn expected. CEO Stuart Gulliver appears to be making progress in stemming the fall in revenue at HSBC; adjusted revenues rose by 2% (once you strip out currency effects and the impat of selling HSBC\u2019s Brazil operations). An upbeat Gulliver says: \u201cThis is a good set of results. The increase in adjusted profit was driven by strong performances in three of our four global businesses. Global Banking and Markets had a great quarter; Commercial Banking delivered higher revenue from our liquidity and cash management activities; and Retail Banking and Wealth Management was supported by rising interest rates and renewed customer investment appetite. HSBC shares are up almost 3% in early trading. Oil firm Royal Dutch Shell is leading the rally in London, up 3%, after beating analyst forecasts. Shell doubled its earnings to $3.8bn, up from $1.6bn, in what CEO Ben van Beurden called a \u201cstrong quarter\u201d. European stock markets have risen at the start of trading, helped by the fall in the pound and the euro against the US dollar overnight. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 0.5%, while Germany\u2019s DAX rose 0.2% to a fresh all-time high Ireland has got Service Sector PMI day off to a good start. Growth in Ireland\u2019s service sector hit a 10-month high in April, according to Investec\u2019s monthly report. Companies reported a rise in new business, as clients grew more optimistic about economic prospects. This encouraged them to take on more staff to deal with a jump in new orders. This sent the Irish Service PMI rocketing up to 61.1 in April, up from 59.1 in March - the highest reading since last June. Philip O\u2019Sullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland, says the report \u201cpaints a bright picture\u201d for Ireland\u2019s economy, with service sector bosses \u201cstrongly optimistic\u201d about the next 12 months. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a more optimistic mood in the City this morning, after America\u2019s central bank gave an upbeat assessment of the US economy last night. After leaving interest rates on hold, the Federal Reserve predicted that the recent slowdown in US growth was \u201clikely to be transitory\u201d, pointing to encouraging employment statistics and rising business investment. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the statement was... ...carefully crafted to acknowledge what the FOMC suggested were \u2018transitory\u2019 weaknesses in personal consumption and core inflation, while placing particular emphasis on the pick-up in business investment and the strength of the labour market. Fed watchers reckon we should expect a US interest rate rise in June.... That\u2019s pushed up the dollar against the pound and the euro, which means European stock markets are tipped to rise this morning: Investors are now looking to a flurry of service sector reports this morning, from data firm Markit. They may confirm that Europe\u2019s recovery is strengthening, with Germany, Italy, France and Spain\u2019s services PMI all expected to rise. Those figures come between 8.15am and 9am BST. RBC Capital Markets say: For both Spain and Italy, we expect the services reading to improve on March. That, coupled with Tuesday\u2019s higher manufacturing PMI would leave the composite PMI higher in both, consistent with the picture for the wider euro area that the improved Q1 sentiment has been sustained into Q2. The UK service sector PMI (at 9.30am) is tipped to drop to 54.6, from 55 in March -- that would mean a small slowdown in growth. However, the manufacturing and construction PMIs have already beaten expectations, so perhaps services might surprise us as well. We\u2019re also getting new UK car registration figures at 9am BST, and eurozone retail sales figures at 10am. There\u2019s also masses of UK corporate news to watch, with HSBC, Societe Generale, Next, Morrisons, Royal Dutch Shell, Rolls-Royce and Randgold all reporting results.",

Thus, an easy win for Theresa May next month combined with a pick-up in UK economic data could help GBP/USD break through the 1.30 barrier in the coming weeks.

Going full steam ahead with staff hires rising at one of the fastest rates since last summer, this relieved capacity pressures and provides a signal that service providers anticipate additional growth in the coming months.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe driver of growth came primarily from business clients, as consumers took a back seat, uneasy about rising costs for essentials such as food, fuel and energy which rose at the fastest rate since July 2008. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, is encouraged that Britain\u2019s services PMI hit a four-month high in April.</strong></p> <p>But....he\u2019s also concerned that prices rose so sharply; this could hit economic growth this year.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAlthough the services PMI beat expectations, some of the details give pause for thought. Input costs continue to point to higher inflation in the months ahead, a factor that is likely to weigh on consumers. Furthermore, although firms\u2019 optimism about the year ahead is still positive, it fell for the third consecutive month.</p> <p> \u201cNevertheless, the figures continue to point to the economy expanding in the current quarter, something that will provide the PM with some comfort going into the General Election and the Brexit negotiations soon after. However, an interesting nuance in the data at the moment is that surveys signal a greater sense of growth than the hard data \u2013 though markets are unlikely to be bothered this.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-590ae8e4e4b097b3ab99c03e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-04T08:48:53.320Z\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Service sector firms hit customers with price hikes</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>But there\u2019s bad news too..... service sector companies are hiking prices at the fastest race since July 2008.</strong></p> <p>Firms argue that they had to raise prices, because they\u2019ve been hit by higher costs themselves.</p> <p>Markit reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>UK service providers indicated a strong rise in input costs during April, despite the rate of inflation easing to a seven-month low.

      "bodyText": "Batteries that have powered electric cars around the UK will get a second life providing energy storage for households, with the launch this week of a British-made home battery to rival the one made by Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla. The cells will be made by the Japanese car-maker Nissan in Sunderland, where its popular Leaf electric car is built, and sold in partnership with the US power firm Eaton. Buyers will be able to choose cheaper, used batteries that are no longer fit for electric car use, or pricier new ones. They are believed to be the first British-made household batteries pitched to the embryonic UK home storage market. The batteries inside the Tesla Powerwall were previously made in Japan by Panasonic, but since January have been produced at its vast Gigafactory in Nevada. Sonnen, a German storage company, builds its European and Australian home batteries in Wildpoldsried, Germany. With falling costs, home storage is seen as increasingly attractive in the UK, particularly to early adopters and the 850,000 homes with solar panels. Solar owners can make the electricity they generate more valuable by storing it in the battery and using it later instead of exporting it to the grid \u2013 Eaton and Nissan estimate such customers will be about \u00a343 better off each month. Batteries also make it easier for people to take advantage of \u201ctime of day\u201d energy deals, which charge consumers less if they avoid periods when energy demand peaks, for example at 4-7pm on weekdays. Such tariffs are expected to proliferate as every UK home is fitted with a smart meter by the end of 2020. Nissan has partnered with Eaton, a US power management company with revenues of $20bn (\u00a315.5bn), to sell the XStorage Home systems, which are about the size of a conventional boiler. The lithium-ion batteries will be priced from \u00a35,000 and up, depending on the home, with installations carried out by a nationwide network of electricians beginning in July. Cyrille Brisson, vice-president of EMEA at Eaton, said: \u201cWe\u2019re clearly going into this market with a view to becoming the leader of the market, with the weight of Nissan and its factory in Sunderland, and with Eaton\u2019s very strong base of installers. We believe we have the knowledge and capacity.\u201d The new batteries will come with a 10-year warranty; those reused from cars will have a five-year warranty. While the batteries will be made in Sunderland, they will be assembled in Morocco. On Thursday, Eaton will also announce a sponsorship deal with Manchester City football club, which Nissan already sponsors. Fans will be able to buy a special, Man City-branded version of the storage systems. But the Nissan-Eaton partnership will face stiff competition from Tesla, which makes electric cars, solar panels and batteries. The California-headquartered company has already installed its Powerwall systems across the UK, aided by a high profile launch by the billionaire Musk. The next generation of the Powerwall, which was meant to launch in the UK earlier this year but was delayed, will be installed in the first British homes later in May. The Powerwall 2 costs \u00a35,400. While Tesla has the edge on name recognition, Eaton and Nissan hope to woo customers with the environmental credentials of reusing old batteries and the fact they are made in Britain. Separately, a new report on Thursday said that many of the entrepreneurs involved in renewable energy had reacted to government subsidy cuts by moving into the burgeoning battery sector. SmartestEnergy, a renewable power buyer, found there were 20MW of commercial batteries operating in 2016, which it predicted would increase 27-fold by 2020.",

      "bodyText": "The Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, has warned the rise in household debt has made Australia\u2019s economy less resilient to future shocks. He said some households were carrying such high levels of debt relative to income that they may respond to a future economic shock by sharply cutting spending. In a speech to the Economic Society of Australia on Thursday, Lowe said he was concerned about the link between rising household debt and house prices, though not because he thought the banking system risked becoming unstable. He said Australia\u2019s banks were \u201csoundly capitalised\u201d and recent stress tests confirmed they were resilient to large movements in residential property prices. Rather, he said the RBA was concerned about the possibility of \u201cfuture sharp cuts in household spending\u201d from highly indebted households. Given the high levels of debt and housing prices, relative to incomes, it was likely some households could respond to a future shock to income or housing prices by deciding they had borrowed too much, he said. \u201cThis could prompt a sharp contraction in their spending, as they try to get their balance sheets back into better shape. \u201cAn otherwise manageable downturn could be turned into something more serious,\u201d he warned. Lowe\u2019s warning comes just five days before the federal budget, in which the government is expected to announce plans to charge foreigners up to $5,000 for leaving their Australian apartments empty. The government is also reportedly planning to ban foreigners from buying more than half of the apartments in new apartment builds, in a bid to help more Australians buy their first property. Lowe said the RBA was mindful of the changes that have occurred in the economy in response to rising house prices and household debt. He said in earlier periods of rising housing prices, the household sector withdrew equity from their housing to finance spending, but today, households were much less inclined to do this. \u201cMany of us feel that we have enough debt and don\u2019t want to increase consumption using borrowed money,\u201d Lowe said. He said his overall assessment was that the economy had become less resilient to future shocks as house prices and debt have risen. \u201cGiven this assessment, the Reserve Bank has strongly supported the prudential measures undertaken by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [Apra],\u201d he said. \u201cDouble-digit growth in debt owed by investors at a time of weak income growth cannot be strengthening the resilience of our economy.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s accounting watchdog has begun an investigation into KPMG\u2019s audit of Rolls-Royce, after the engineering group settled a bribery case with the Serious Fraud Office earlier this year. Rolls-Royce agreed in January to pay \u00a3671m in penalties to settle long-running corruption allegations, in a deferred prosecution agreement. The cost of the settlement coupled with the slide in the pound since the Brexit vote pushed the firm into a \u00a34.6bn annual loss, the biggest in its history. The Financial Reporting Council said it had started investigating KPMG\u2019s conduct in relation to its audit of Rolls-Royce\u2019s financial statements between 2010 and 2013. KPMG said: \u201cIt is important that regulators acting in the public interest should review high profile issues. We will cooperate fully with the FRC\u2019s investigation, which follows the SFO\u2019s investigations into Rolls-Royce. We are confident in the quality of all the audit work we have completed for Rolls-Royce, including the 2010-13 period the FRC is considering.\u201d Rolls-Royce apologised at the high court in January after it was found to have paid bribes including a luxury car and millions of pounds\u2019 worth of cash to middlemen to secure orders in Indonesia, Russia, China, Thailand, India and Nigeria. The settlement was reached with investigators from the UK, US and Brazil, who started to examine the allegations five years ago. It revealed the company\u2019s use of middlemen over three decades. For example, the firm paid more than $36m (\u00a328m) in Thailand between 1991 and 2005 to agents to help it win three contracts to supply Trent aero engines to Thai Airways. Meanwhile, the Unite union celebrated a pay deal for Rolls-Royce\u2019s Rotherham factory guaranteeing a minimum rise of 17% over three years that will be signed on Friday. Unite said the package, which will benefit about 120 staff below the level of management, was \u201cone of the largest deals that Rolls-Royce has agreed in recent years\u201d. The union said the company had finally realised that pay rates in Rotherham were among the lowest across the engineering group, forcing workers at the south Yorkshire site, which makes single crystal turbine blades, to leave for better jobs. Rolls-Royce held its annual meeting in Derby, where it employs 14,000 people, on Thursday. Its chief executive, Warren East, told shareholders that trading in the first few months of the year had met expectations and that the outlook for 2017 was unchanged. East said: \u201cAt this early stage in the year we see no reason to change our expectations for profit and, importantly, cash flow for the year as a whole. \u201cWe have some important transformation initiatives under way and, while we have made good progress in our cost-cutting and efficiency programmes, more needs to be done to ensure we drive sustainable margin improvements within the business.\u201d As in 2016, the engineering firm expects to make most of its profits in the second half of the year, and they are likely to be similar to last year. The company has been slashing costs and is on track to hit its target of \u00a3200m annual savings by the end of 2017.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Matt Canavan has praised the $73m Adani deal with the troubled Whyalla steelworks for the Carmichael coal rail line, suggesting the government could look favourably on the company\u2019s $1bn loan application. The monopoly deal involves Whyalla providing 56,000 tonnes of steel for the 400km railway line from the mine to the Abbot Point port. Adani has applied to the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund (Naif) for a $1bn loan for the railway and the board, established by Canavan, will assess the loan before making recommendations to the minister for final approval. \u201cIt is government policy, as I said, to try and support Australian procurement and Australian industry and so I will obviously be looking to make sure we do maximise Australian involvement in projects that we fund through the Naif,\u201d Canavan said. Asked if the Whyalla deal would make the government look more favourably on the $1bn Adani loan, Canavan said the government was happy to see investors maximise Australian products. \u201cThe Naif is an independent body but, in terms of the government\u2019s position, we\u2019re happy to see investors use and maximise the amount of Australian product in their projects,\u201d Canavan told ABC radio. The deal is reportedly not dependant on securing the government loan but Adani could not confirm that. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, who will unveil the Adani-Whyalla deal on Thursday, has previously said the government loan was a \u201ctipping point\u201d to get the mine going. Under its rules, Naif will only fund projects that are \u201cunlikely to proceed, or only at a much later date, or with limited scope, without Naif financial assistance\u201d. It is understood the steel deal is contingent on Adani receiving financing for the mine. Adani\u2019s Australian chief executive, Jeyakumar Janakaraj said a decision on the project would be made in the next month. Whyalla went into administration in April last year owing nearly $3bn. Canavan said the $73m deal to protect Australian jobs depended on the Carmichael mine going ahead. \u201c[Adani] won\u2019t buy steel to produce modern art, they are building a coalmine so we need to project to go ahead,\u201d Canavan said. \u201cThey are making that decision soon.\u201d Canavan said he was not involved in commercial negotiations but he encouraged the Indian-owned company to look for ways to maximise Australian involvement in their project. He said the government was concentrating on keeping Australian jobs and investment rather than saying \u201cthere\u2019s too many frogs or birds or trees\u201d. He called on Labor to support the Adani mine and jobs at Whyalla, given Adani\u2019s plans to build Australia\u2019s largest coalmine already had federal and state government approval. Bill Shorten has said he supports the Adani coalmine but said the case had not been made for government to provide a $1bn loan. \u201cIf Adani stacks up environmentally and commercially as I hope it does then we look forward to it going ahead,\u201d Shorten said on Tuesday. South Australian Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said it was a cruel trick to pass off a one-off steel order as a lifeline for Whyalla. \u201cTo say a one-off order of 56,000 tonnes of railway line would save the Whyalla steelworks is nothing more than a cruel trick to a community doing it tough,\u201d Hanson-Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of 1% of Arrium\u2019s output over the term of the contract. \u201cIt\u2019s about time we got a Southern Australia infrastructure fund, so we could progress our state with projects like a solar thermal plant, and expanding our public transport network \u2013 projects that will keep the lights on and the fires burning in Whyalla for a long time to come.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "BHP Billiton executives have been warned they could face criminal charges if they shift the company out of Australia. The US hedge funds Elliott Associates and Elliott International have been trying to convince BHP Billiton\u2019s shareholders in Australia to dissolve the company\u2019s dual-listed structure and move the company to London. At the moment, the big miner is listed on both the Australian Securities Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, but Elliott has been trying repeatedly to break up the company and list it solely on the LSE. BHP executives have dismissed the proposal, saying it would cost more than US$1.3bn (A$1.7bn) to dissolve the dual-listed structure just to save less than US$2.5m a year. They say the move would result in a huge transfer of value from Australian shareholders to London shareholders, too. At the moment, BHP\u2019s Australian shares are trading at a 14% premium to BHP\u2019s London shares. \u201cThe board and management have concluded that the costs and associated disadvantages of each element of Elliott\u2019s proposal would significantly outweigh the potential benefits,\u201d BHP executives said in April. \u201cWe believe that Elliott materially overstates the potential value that could be created by its proposals.\u201d The Australian treasurer, Scott Morrison, has sent a clear signal to Australian shareholders who may be attracted to the idea that BHP executives could face criminal charges if the deal goes ahead. In 2001 the Australian government only allowed BHP Limited and Billiton Plc to merge subject to conditions, including that the new company remained listed on the ASX. Morrison said those conditions applied indefinitely unless revoked or varied by him, and it was clear the proposals from Elliott Associates were inconsistent with those conditions. \u201cIt is unthinkable that any Australian government could allow this original big Australian to head offshore,\u201d Morrison said on Thursday. \u201cShould BHP Billiton implement the Elliott Associates proposal contrary to the conditions imposed in 2001, it may commit a criminal offence and could be subject to civil penalties under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (FATA). \u201cIf the company is convicted of an offence, the directors could be held personally liable. \u201cFurther, a proposal by an LSE-listed company to acquire the assets of BHP Billiton Limited would be a significant action under the FATA. Under the FATA, I am able to order that such an acquisition not occur if it is contrary to the national interest. \u201cIf an acquisition proceeds without my consent, I would be able to order a divestment of the assets acquired and take court action to enforce this order. The proponents of the acquisition may also be liable to civil and criminal penalties.\u201d Matt Canavan, Australia\u2019s minister for resources, supported Morrison\u2019s statement on Thursday. \u201cWe take our foreign investment guidelines and regulations very seriously,\u201d he told ABC Radio National on Thursday. \u201cAbout 15 years ago, in 2001, BHP merged with another company and that merger was agreed to approval but subject to conditions including that BHP remain listed on the Australian stock exchange. \u201cOn our assessment, clearly, the proposal from Elliott \u2026 would breach those conditions and there are penalties to pay if those conditions are breached, so all we are doing is stressing the Australian government\u2019s commitment to uphold our strong and robust foreign investment review framework and that\u2019s something we\u2019ll keep to.\u201d",
