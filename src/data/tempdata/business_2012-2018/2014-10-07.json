      "bodyText": "Ivan Glasenberg will not get anywhere near Rio Tinto for at least six months. Glencore is now off-side as a bidder or merger partner for that period after saying it is \u201cno longer actively considering\u201d an offer. But Glasenberg demonstrated at Xstrata that he can play a long game. Does his latest idea for a big deal just need time to mature? Never say never, of course \u2013 but it would require an astonishing turn of events for GlenTinto to come into being in next half-decade or so. Rio, surely, would have to sink into a deep corporate crisis for its shareholders to think of throwing in their lot with Glasenberg\u2019s higher-risk trading and acquisition machine. First, as argued here yesterday, Rio under chief executive Sam Walsh has sobered up after the madcap takeover of aluminium producer Alcan for $38bn (\u00a319bn) in 2007, probably the worst deal in modern mining history. It is true that iron ore, which provides the bulk of the company\u2019s earnings, is sliding in price. The main raw ingredient used to make steel fetches about $80 a tonne, down from about $140 a couple of years ago. But Rio can still dig the stuff out of the Australian desert and ship it to China for about $45 a tonne. A trading profit margin of 44% ain\u2019t bad. What\u2019s more, Rio can still meet its promises to shareholders at current prices. The dividend yield is 3.8% at today\u2019s share price and there should be enough spare cash to fund a share buy-back or special dividend next year. And, if iron ore prices plummet further, there\u2019s no need to call Glasenberg. Just take his advice to cut capital expenditure to the bone and curtail production. Second, Glencore would bring little to the party apart from financial leverage. Rio\u2019s debt is about $16bn. Borrowings at Glencore, the smaller company, were $33bn at the last count. Thus any offer would have funded largely in Glencore shares, which will remain the case for years to come. Yet Glencore paper is hardly a must-have for a mining investor: its value has fallen 35% since flotation in 2011. Share prices can change, of course. But it will still be the case that Rio has the superior assets. Its main mines are concentrated in stable democracies and contain enough supply for a century or so. Why join Glencore\u2019s adventures in the Democratic Republic of Congo and elsewhere? The only possible reason would be a huge takeover premium. But that\u2019s the third reason why this idea looks a non-starter: Glasenberg doesn\u2019t do big premiums. He was bullied into paying a modest version at Xstrata, but circumstances there were different: Glencore already owned 35% of its target and failure was unimaginable. By way of garnish, one could add further complications, such as possible objections from competition authorities and the Australian foreign investment review board. But the bottom line is that it is almost impossible to see the financial stars coming into alignment any time soon. Rio doesn\u2019t need Glencore; and Glencore will struggle to offer attractive terms without killing its own share price. Glasenberg always gets what he wants in the end, they say. But there are exceptions to any rule and this looks to be one. Bank must stick to rules One director of HSBC\u2019s UK bank has resigned, and another is likely to follow, apparently alarmed by the prospect of working under a tougher regulatory regime that could see individuals go to jail if they took reckless decisions that led to the collapse of their employer. Bankers, no doubt, will claim this development proves the Bank of England\u2019s proposed new rules are unworkable and will deter good candidates from applying to join the boards of banks. Expect the lobbying to go into overdrive. Threadneedle Street should resist the pleading as far as possible. The new regime is built on a firm foundation \u2013 the observation by the Banking Commission that senior individuals at failed and unscrupulous banks escaped punishment via an \u201caccountability firewall.\u201d Time after time, senior directors of failed institutions argued at parliamentary hearings that responsibilities were delegated or decisions were made collectively. Like Macavity, they were never there. The new rules are designed to makes lines of responsibility and accountability clear, which seems entirely sensible. Much of the fuss is concentrated on the threat of jail and the supposed presumption of guilt when banks collapse. But, as almost every lawyer agrees, the bar to prove recklessness will be set very high: it will cover only extreme cases. Two HSBC bankers, one of whom also cited work commitments elsewhere, do not amount to a rebellion. The Bank should stick to its principles, and reflect that any reform worth implementing might suffer a few drop-outs.",

      "bodyText": "Eight hundred jobs are about to be lost in Northern Ireland after cigarette maker JTI Gallaher announced it was shutting its plant in Ballymena, Antrim. Unionist Eurosceptics blamed EU directives aimed at curbing smoking as a major factor in the firm closing the factory where it has operated for decades. Workers were told of the planned closure by management on Tuesday. Ian Paisley Jr, the Democratic Unionist party MP for North Antrim, said the redundancies would start in May 2016, adding that the announcement \u201ceffectively starts a 90-day consultation with workers, not only in Ballymena but across JTI\u2019s European footprint, to cease production\u201d.

Each year almost \u00a360m is pumped into the local wage economy by JTI.

This inevitably has led to the need to review JTI\u2019s manufacturing operations. \u201cJTI will undertake appropriate consultations on proposals to change its product sourcing, which could lead to the closure of some of its manufacturing sites. JTI\u2019s facilities in Lisnafillan, Northern Ireland, and Wervik, Belgium, would cease to operate, with production moving to other facilities, potentially in Poland and Romania.\u201d Jim Nicholson, the Ulster Unionist MEP, also laid some of the blame for the closure on EU directives against tobacco companies. \u201cWhen the European legislation was first mooted, I predicted negative consequences for companies like Gallaher\u2019s, placing severe pressure on maintaining the jobs in Ballymena,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s high streets have been transformed in the last 10 years and the change is well illustrated by the rise of tattoo parlours \u2013 shopping parades are increasingly populated by retail outlets where the customer actually needs to be there in person. Tattoo parlour numbers have nearly tripled in a decade, but there have also been big increases in convenience stores and gyms as the closure of video rental stores, travel agents and photo labs has ushered in a new breed of high street retailer. New figures on the makeup of Britain\u2019s town centres paint a picture of high streets that are increasingly social, as well as retail. Many have seen a big rise in the number of evening attractions such as restaurants, bars and clubs as the presence of traditional specialists selling clothes, flowers or even newspapers has waned. \u201cIn recent years we\u2019ve seen a significant shift in the makeup of the high street, which has clearly become a more social environment, with more restaurants and leisure facilities emerging up and down the country,\u201d said Richard Jenkings, senior consultant at data firm Experian. \u201cAt the same time, we have seen a clear expansion in the number of retailers where the customer actually needs to be there in person to enjoy the experience, such as caf\u00e9s, health clubs and even tattooists.\u201d The number of tattoo parlours has surged 173% over the decade according to Experian, which tracks changes in 2,000 key retail locations around the country. Curly Moore, a veteran tattoo artist based at Lionel\u2019s Tattoo Studios in Oxford, has watched the number of local parlours increase from just two to 13 in the last six or seven years. \u201cIt\u2019s insane,\u201d he said of the expansion. \u201cGenerally speaking tattoos have become more popular. It\u2019s not as shocking as it once was and unfortunately it has lost a bit of its edge.\u201d The choice of venues to eat out at or grab food-to-go is also increasing, with the number of takeaways up 54%. Fish and chip shops are also back on the menu \u2013 there are 86% more than in 2004. The rise in fast food is not necessarily bad news for the nation\u2019s waistlines as there are now more than twice as many health clubs as there were in 2003 to burn off those excess calories. Expansion of the so-called night-time economy has been most marked in cities such as Bristol and Durham and the trendy London district of Brixton. In the Broadmead area of Bristol, the number of restaurants, cafes, pubs and nightclubs is up 75% in 10 years. Brixton and Durham have seen growth of more than 50%. Big increases have also been recorded in Manchester, Norwich and St Ives in Cornwall. But just as eating out becomes more fashionable, the march of technology is consigning the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of some retailers to the dustbin of history. The number of TV and DVD rental outlets has dropped 98% over the past decade as the weekend ritual of renting a film is replaced by streaming services from businesses such as Netflix, which pipes movies and TV shows direct to TVs and tablets. This sharp decline is illustrated by the once ubiquitous Blockbuster, which closed down its remaining stores at the end of last year. The impact of the internet has also hit high street travel agents hard, with the number of holiday shops almost halving in 10 years \u2013 with many customers migrating to online price comparison websites. The popularity of getting your holiday photos printed when you get home is also declining: the number of shops specialising in film processing is down 70% as smartphone and digital cameras kill off what was once a brisk high street trade. One area of major growth, however, is convenience store retailing, where the number of outlets is up 186% \u2013 making brands such as Tesco Express and Sainsbury\u2019s Local the fastest growing presence on the high street. The major supermarket chains are racing to open high street outlets as shoppers move away from the big weekly trek to out-of-town supermarkets to buying little, local and often. The Institute of Grocery Distribution, which represents the food and consumer goods industry, predicts that in five years the sales rung up in small neighbourhood stores will have increased by a third to almost \u00a350bn \u2013 piling pressure on the economics of the traditional supermarket model. \u201cThere has been a noticeable rise in the number of convenience stores, suggesting time-pressured consumers are increasingly expecting the high street to play a different role, providing services that can exist as a complementary offering alongside internet shopping,\u201d said Jenkings. Along with betting shops, mobile phone retailers have been among the types of businesses keen to open high street stores in recent years. But last month\u2019s collapse of Phones 4u \u2013 which resulted in the closure of 362 stores and more than 2,400 job losses \u2013 points to a high street in constant flux as changing buying habits and new technology trends continue to reshape its purpose.",

      "bodyText": "EE, the UK\u2019s biggest mobile operator, is to become the latest media company to launch a set-top box in a bid to take on rivals including BSkyB andTalkTalk. The box, which will be offered to customers for free as part of a broadband package, will offer a service that competes with YouView. YouView is run by a consortium including the BBC, ITV, BT, TalkTalk, Channel 4 and Channel 5. In 2009, Orange, now part of EE, looked into buying the technology behind YouView\u2019s predecessor Project Kangaroo after the venture was blocked by competition regulators. EE has subsequently held talks about joining the YouView consortium, but no deal has ever materialised and instead the company has decided to launch its own service. It is expected to be free with an EE home broadband subscription and \u00a39.95 per month for mobile-only customers, and will offer over 70 Freeview channels and a range of on-demand and catch-up services. Deals are understood to have been struck with public service broadcasters including the BBC, ITV and Channel 5 but not, unsurprisingly, BSkyB which offers directly competitive services such as Now TV, with its own budget set-top box. EE has joined the race to attract budget-conscious Freeview households that have an internet connection, of which there are about 12 million, and which BT and TalkTalk have targeted. TalkTalk has been particularly successful with its model: its cheapest TV package is \u00a38.50 with a free set-top box, quickly building a base of more than 1 million TV customers. Like BT, which reinvigorated its TV offering by partnering with YouView and poaching prime sports deals such as rights for Premier League and Champions League football, the goal is to secure customers looking for an enhanced amount of services and content from one provider. BSkyB, under threat from UK rivals and US firms such as Netflix and Amazon, has targeted cheaper customers looking to \u201cdip\u201d into pay-TV with cheaper options it offers through its Now TV offering. EE is aiming to capitalise on the explosion of video use on smartphones and tablets. The arrival of fast 4G services has seen more than 50% of its fast internet capacity taken up by video usage. The new service is expected to allow users to watch TV programmes on up to three devices for one subscription, as well as via the set-top box on a television. EE\u2019s move follows a flurry of activity by major media owners to control content and viewing, including a bid by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox for Time Warner. Fox is also looking to merge its production division Shine, maker of shows including MasterChef, with Big Brother maker Endemol and the company behind American Idol. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 October 2014 to remove a reference to Netflix in the first paragraph",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A record number of luxury homes worth \u00a360bn are being built in London, creating a construction crunch that could lead to many of them being delayed or even ditched, a report shows. The number of new luxury homes being planned or built over the next decade has climbed 25% to 25,000 units, according to the report from EC Harris, a built asset consultancy. The properties have a combined sales value of \u00a360bn, up 20% on the level reported last year. The rate of growth is down from 29% in 2013 and 70% in 2012, indicating that there are fewer development opportunities in central London. Mark Farmer, head of EC Harris\u2019s residential team, said: \u201cWith the UK economy back on track and London deemed a safe haven for international property investors, it\u2019s not surprising that demand for luxury homes is fuelling ever-increasing development.\u201d However, with developers and investors struggling to keep up with buyer demand, up to half the homes planned in the next five years could end up falling well behind schedule due to a lack of available contractors. The South Bank is the most popular area for high-end homes, accounting for a third of new projects, closely followed by Chelsea, Fulham and the City. There is growing interest in building homes valued at \u00a3500 to \u00a31,000 a square foot, particularly near Crossrail, which will link west to east London, or close to the London Overground network. The South Bank stretch from Battersea to Tower Bridge has had the largest increase in unit numbers, up 34% to 7,705 new homes under development. Chelsea and Fulham is next with a 6% increase to 4,861 homes, followed by the City, up 45% to 4,176. The unprecedented level of building is creating a shortage of qualified workers, and the report predicts many projects will be delayed or even scrapped. Farmer said: \u201cThere is simply not the capacity out there to meet demand and many projects will undoubtedly fall by the wayside or experience delivery difficulties due to sheer lack of resources. Many developers and investors, when in a position to do so, are therefore looking to jump the queue and are paying premiums for construction so they can deliver on promises they have already made to their purchasers.\u201d About 1,300 luxury homes are likely to be completed in London this year, 700 fewer than EC Harris had predicted last year amid delays in the construction process. The consultancy defines luxury homes as those that will sell for at least \u00a31,350 a square foot, up from \u00a31,250 last year.",

      "bodyText": "Samsung Electronics has reported a 60% slump in quarterly profits as the sudden decline in its mobile phone business draws comparisons with fallen rivals BlackBerry and Nokia. Having risen in just three years to dominate the hugely lucrative global smartphone market, Samsung faces challenges on all fronts. Its flagship Galaxy S5 handset is not selling as well as last year\u2019s model; Chinese and Indian rivals are stealing business and show no signs of stopping; and Apple is moving into its patch with large-screen premium phones. Those factors led the South Korean company to announce on Tuesday that operating profits for the three months to 30 September were 4.1tn won (\u00a32.4bn), down 60% from a year before, with revenues of 47tn won falling 20% from the same period in 2013. The company signalled \u201cdeclines in the mobile business due to intensified smartphone competition\u201d and although it insisted that smartphone sales had increased marginally, some analysts took a different view. Counterpoint Research, a mobile analyst company based in Hong Kong, said Samsung\u2019s shipments had fallen year-on-year by more than 2% to 79m, and the \u201cmarginal increase\u201d was in comparison to the second quarter\u2019s 74.9m shipments. It is the first time Samsung\u2019s smartphone shipments have dropped year-on-year, which carries warning signs for its future. Its profit also relies on a multiplier effect: its phones use its displays and chips, so when handset sales are booming, more displays and chips are made, improving scale and lowering price, and helping to win outside business. When phone sales slow, the multiplier fades away, as do profits. \u201cSamsung is getting closer to the fate of its peers,\u201d said Richard Windsor, of the Radio Free Mobile consultancy. Samsung uses Google\u2019s Android software and analysts fear that Samsung has lost its chance to dominate other manufacturers that use Android, such as China\u2019s Xiaomi and Huawei. Windsor said Samsung\u2019s profits could follow the course of multiple Android handset manufacturers such as HTC, LG and Sony, which have boomed and then dwindled amid expanding competition. \u201cIt appears that Samsung has been cutting prices in order to maintain market share but has lost market share anyway,\u201d Windsor said. \u201cThis increasingly looks like beginnings of the vicious cycle which ended the dominance of Ericsson, HTC, Motorola, BlackBerry and Nokia.\u201d That is the scary thought that has Samsung\u2019s executives \u2013 which has a highly critical internal culture, and always seeks improvement \u2013 desperately seeking the best route forward. Nokia, BlackBerry and Ericsson are salutary tales in the mobile business: former darlings which were too slow to adapt to changing markets, and were left behind. Samsung\u2019s problem is that while it has dominated Android smartphones across the whole spectrum, from cheap to pricey, it is seeing its low-end sales eroded by upstarts such as Xiaomi and Huawei and Micromax from India, which have begun to match and even beat it for price and popularity. Samsung said the average selling price of its phones fell, \u201cdriven by reduced proportional shipments of high-end models\u201d together with price cuts on older models. \u201cDespite the discounts, sales did not increase, so that means they shed profit to just barely maintain their market position,\u201d said Tom Kang of Counterpoint Research. Nor is there any sign of smartwatches \u2013 six in the past year \u2013 generating useful revenues. Jan Dawson, of Jackdaw Research, said: \u201cAs the vast majority of future global growth in smartphones will come from low-end customers spending under $150 (\u00a395) on a handset, it\u2019s going to be really tough for Samsung to get going again.\u201d But Samsung\u2019s bigger problem, say analysts, is that while it has dominated smartphones, it has not made itself irreplaceable. Samsung\u2019s TouchWiz interface \u2013 its adaptation of Android \u2013 is not universally popular and its ChatOn app will not stop customers from switching to an Android handset made by Sony, LG, Xiaomi or Huawei. Whereas Apple has focused on building an enviable app library and content store through iTunes, Samsung has relied on Google and limited its room for manoeuvre. \u201cSamsung has ceded control of the ecosystem to Google, meaning that the options that it has to differentiate its products in the future are extremely limited,\u201d said Windsor. Meanwhile, sales of top-end phones are slowing, while Apple has continued to eat away at the premium market of phones costing more than $400. And during the quarter Samsung lost its lead in China to Xiaomi and in India to Micromax. Analysts concur that Samsung\u2019s days of dominating the market by blanketing it with gigantic advertising and marketing spending \u2013 which includes payments to sales staff in phone stores \u2013 are over. Now, it has to compete with cut-throat margins at the low end, and newly resurgent rivals at the top end including Apple, which has released its large-screen iPhone 6 Plus that competes directly with Samsung\u2019s Note series of \u201cphablets\u201d \u2013 phone-tablet hybrids \u2013 that are popular in Asia. \u201cSamsung\u2019s situation is graver than expected. It should put a greater emphasis on cost cuts and review its business strategies from the zero point,\u201d said Oh Sang-woo, an analyst at Leading Investment. \u201cWhat matters is how Samsung will protect its falling market share in China and key emerging markets like India.\u201d Kang said: \u201cIt still has time, as that\u2019s one of the advantages of being number one. People are reluctant to flock to an alternative all at once. But Samsung should get their strategy straightened out soon. They\u2019ve been throwing the same course repeatedly, and getting pounded by the same player each time \u2013 Apple. They shouldn\u2019t be stubborn; they can just pass over the star player and compete with the next in line. They can win the game if they swallow their pride. The market is about more value for the same amount of money, and Samsung should switch gears towards that.\u201d But Windsor warns that as sales fall and the multiplier effect falls away, Samsung\u2019s troubles could deepen. \u201cIf its share of phone sales continues to fall, then this multiplier will no longer be possible, and Samsung will come closer and closer to joining the long-suffering ranks of every other Android handset maker in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cThese companies make 2-4% operating margins in the best instance.\u201d",

We personally fear we may have lost all that we have put into our homes \u2013 the huge financial investment, but also the time, energy and love spent making these houses our homes and this estate an enviably open and welcoming community.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "You\u2019ll never have it so good again. That\u2019s the message for the rich western economies from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after yet another downgrade to its growth forecasts. For a quarter of a century Japan\u2019s once-booming economy has struggled; now Europe is heading in the same direction. The IMF thinks there is a 40% chance of a recession in the eurozone over the next year and a 30% risk of deflation. Before the slump of 2008, the IMF boasted of how the global economy was enjoying its fastest period of sustained growth since the early 1970s. Now it talks openly of the possibility of secular stagnation: the notion that there has been a permanent downward shift in the potential growth rates of advanced economies. Olivier Blanchard, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, said there had been a structural slowdown in the west, which was why the global economy was unlikely to return to the pace of expansion seen before the financial crisis. But the IMF also believes these lower levels of potential growth will be achievable only if interest rates are kept very low. Returning monetary policy to the settings in place before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 \u2013 with a bank rate of about 5% in the UK \u2013 would lead to even lower levels of activity and high unemployment. This is the scenario described by Alvin Hansen, the economist who coined the phrase \u201csecular stagnation\u201d in 1938. The date is important because despite a recovery from the great depression in the early 1930s, there was a relapse in 1937. Pessimism about the future was as strong then as it is now, yet during the next three decades the global economy expanded at rates not seen before \u2013 or since. It is possible, therefore, that the experience of the recent past skews forecasts of the future. When the world economy was humming along, the IMF expected the boom to be everlasting. Now it can see nothing other than a continuation of the sluggish performance of recent years. Some slowdown in the pace of growth in the west is inevitable given declining growth rates. But population is only one of the factors that lead to stronger growth. Others include labour market participation, the skill of the workforce and technological progress. It is not immediately obvious why countries should have become dumber or less creative over the past decade, so there may be other reasons \u2013 the overhang of debt or a malfunctioning financial sector \u2013 that explain the slowdown. Three in four UK economists polled by the Centre for Macroeconomics are sceptical of the secular stagnation thesis. There are a couple of other points worth mentioning. The first is whether secular stagnation \u2013 assuming it exists \u2013 actually matters. If, as some studies show, there is no link between growth and happiness once gross domestic product hits a certain level, why be so obsessed about achieving rates of expansion that threaten the environment? In truth, most of the happiness studies relate to a period when real incomes were rising. It remains to be seen how people respond to a lost decade of falling living standards. There is little sense of wellbeing levels rising, perhaps because the fruits of growth have been so unevenly distributed. The second issue is that policymakers think something structural has happened to the global economy over the past decade, whether or not they think it amounts to secular stagnation. That means that interest rates \u2013 even when they start rising \u2013 will remain low by historic standards. As Blanchard noted yesterday, there is a risk that the prospect of permanently low borrowing costs will encourage financial markets to take bigger and bigger risks. We know where that road leads.",

      "bodyText": "Back to Greece where the finance minister has been forced to deny auditors representing the country\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors have abruptly ended their latest inspection tour. From Athens Helena Smith writes: Finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis denied that mission chiefs from the EU, ECB and IMF had cut short their review of the Greek economy because of disagreement on an array of issues. \u201cEveryone wants Greece to succeed and for that reason they will support the Greek government,\u201d he said. \u201cIt goes without saying that the government will continue implementing reforms.\u201d Earlier in the day media reports suggested that troika officials had packed their bags in a fit of pique because neither side could agree on the incendiary matter of non performing loans \u2013 and a government budget that auditors regard as overly optimistic for 2015. At \u20ac75bn, Greek banks have the highest non performing loans in Europe. The officials, who had been due to leave Greece later this week, will now return in November once stress tests have been conducted on the debt-burdened nation\u2019s banks. One insider said with the government facing a crucial vote of confidence later this week \u2013 and a debate set to begin tomorrow \u2013 it was deemed \u201cmore diplomatic\u201d if the negotiators disappeared. More than at any other time Athens needs to conclude talks with the bodies keeping its economy afloat if it wants to act on its pledge to exit its EU/IMF bailout by the end of the year. Under intense political pressure from an increasingly popular anti-austerity opposition, prime minister Antonis Samaras has repeatedly said that exiting the programme has become his top priority. Ahead of talks with Samaras this evening, Evangelos Venizelos, the coalition government\u2019s deputy leader, announced that Greece had entered a critical period where much was at risk of being lost. \u201cThe next months will be decisive for the decades ahead,\u201d he told the second annual meeting of Greek entrepreneurs. \u201cThe achievements of the past five years could be lost in five days,\u201d he said referring to the political uncertainty that has hung over Greece with talk of early elections. The confidence vote was called to defuse speculation of snap polls. But with yields on Greek bonds rising in recent weeks and the Athens stock exchange falling in afternoon trade, investors clearly fear a period of prolonged political paralysis has returned to haunt Greece. On that note, it\u2019s time to close down for the evening . Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. A combination of economic growth fears and worries about the spread of the Ebola virus, not to mention continuing geopolitical concerns in Hong Kong, Ukraine and Syria, helped sent stock markets lower again, writes Nick Fletcher. Travel companies were hit by the news that an Ebola case had been confirmed in Spain, while worse than expected German industrial production figures and the IMF cutting its global growth forecasts unsettled investors once more. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 68.07 points or 1.04% lower at 6495.58 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.34% to 9086.21 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.81% at 4209.14 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.73% to 19,771.71 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.02% at 10,430.7 (after the Ebola news) In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 131 points or 0,77% lower. Over in Greece, the campaign by cleaning ladies fired last year as part of the government\u2019s deregulation of labour laws continues. Helena Smith reports: Despite the rain and their ongoing court battles with the Greek state, the women who have become the emblems of austerity\u2019s injustice are in robust mood. \u201cWe are not going to back down and have lots more surprises in store,\u201d said Despoina Kostopoulou, the cleaners\u2019 unofficial spokeswoman. \u201cWe won\u2019t relent until we are reinstated in the jobs that we wrongly lost.\u201d The women said they had derived \u201cgreat strength and courage\u201d from a letter of solidarity the British film director Ken Loach had sent them on hearing of their plight. Here\u2019s the Ken Loach letter: Dear Friends, I have heard of your situation from friends in England. What a story! Your strength and determination to fight for real jobs with fair wages is inspiring. We have many stories like yours here, as I\u2019m sure you know. The constant pressure to privatise our public services is destroying the services and bringing poverty and insecurity to working people. The European Union and big corporations, supported by the politicians, are formidable enemies. But you too are formidable! We need to support each other, as you say. Paul Laverty, who writes our film scripts, including Bread &amp; Roses, will be in Athens at the end of October for a couple of days (25 \u2013 27th Oct). He may have a busy schedule at the film festival then, but he hopes he can meet with you then. In the meantime, everyone here sends their greetings, solidarity and warmest good wishes. Yours sincerely, Ken Loach Back with the IMF World Economic Outlook, TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady alights on the fund\u2019s comments on investment for growth, saying: The IMF\u2019s research shows why austerity is failing across Europe and we have the slowest recovery from a crash on record. Waiting for growth to turn up is not enough, we need concerted government action to improve living standards in both Britain and our EU neighbours through investment in jobs, infrastructure, skills and wage packets. \u201cWithout such action living standards will fail to recover. And complacent governments seem to want to go back to pre-crash business as usual, despite the worrying signs we can see already of house prices surging, an unreformed finance sector and household debts rising again. Only public investment and a strong industrial policy will give us a rebalanced economy that can deliver for all. Commodities giant Glencore has just released a statement saying it is \u201cno longer actively considering\u201d a merger with Rio Tinto. It comes a day after Bloomberg reported that Glencore was considering a tie-up in 2015, prompting Rio to say it had rejected the deal. Glencore says: Glencore announces that in July 2014 it made an informal enquiry by telephone call to Rio Tinto, seeking to gauge whether there might be any interest at Rio Tinto in investigating some form of merger between the two companies. Rio Tinto responded that it was not interested in pursuing these discussions. Glencore confirms that it is no longer actively considering any possible merger transaction with, or offer for the shares of, Rio Tinto. So, that means Glencore cannot now bid for Rio for six months, unless another company launches a bid or Rio does a U-turn and agrees a deal. Or unless there is \u201ca material change in circumstances.\u201d So the deal may not be sunk for ever.... Just in.... UK growth slowed to 0.7% in the third quarter of this year, from 0.9% in the April-June quarter. That\u2019s according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research\u2019s monthly estimate. My colleague Angela Monaghan has the details: The think tank\u2019s estimate is in tune with other recent data suggesting the recovery is losing some of its momentum in the second half of the year. The broader message from NIESR however is don\u2019t panic, it\u2019s still a story of recovery in the UK and although there are a number of risks, none of them have materialised as yet. Simon Kirby, principal research fellow, says: \u201cGrowth rates move around from quarter to quarter. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised to see growth moderate somewhat from the very robust rate in the preceding quarter. It\u2019s a story of continuing economic recovery.\u201d We will have to wait until 24 October for the first official estimate of third quarter growth from the Office for National Statistics. The news that the IMF had cut its growth forecast, added to this morning\u2019s tumble in German industrial activity, send shares falling on Wall Street. The Dow Jones fell 135 points in early trading. And finally, a question about American monetary policy -- when does the IMF think US interest rates will rise, and what impact will that have on the rest of the world? Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, IMF deputy director, says that the IMF expects the US recovery will continue this year and in 2015. That means that the Fund expects the Federal Reserve will start to raise interest rates, maybe around the middle of next year. We expect that the normalisation of US interest rates will be positive for emerging markets, but policymakers need to watch for bumps along the way, he concludes. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. What is the main priority for Japan in the next 6 to 12 months? The challenge that Japan has is very clear, Blanchard replies. They cannot let their debt/gdp levels rise, so they need fiscal consolidation. But they also need growth -- either through exports, or through improved private demand and domestic consumption. And the news here is \u201cmixed\u201d. The weak yen has not, yet, boosted exports, and the recent sales tax has hit demand. What does the IMF think of the plan, from the EU\u2019s new president Jean-Claude Juncker, for a major \u20ac300bn investment plan? Infrastructure investment in Europe is a great idea, Olivier Blanchard says, as many countries need better infrastructure and there are many people out work. But how it is funded....that\u2019s up to the EU... How can Spain avoid deflation? Blanchard replies that the IMF is relieved that the Spanish economy is achieving growth, although it could be stronger, and it hopes that Spain will avoid full-blown deflation. The press conference turns to low-income countries sub-Sahara Africa; what\u2019s the IMF\u2019s view for them? Rupa Duttagupta, IMF deputy division chief, replies the the IMF expects another year of strong growth, over 5%, in the region. But the outbreak of Ebola has hit three countries hard -- Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, Duttagupta says. We have recently dispursed $130m to help ongoing programmes in the region. We believe the spillover from ebola is limited, but we will continue to monitor the situation, she adds. What\u2019s does the IMF think about the European Central Bank\u2019s plan to buy asset-backed securities (bundles of loans to small firms)? Chief economist Olivier Blanchard says: We believe it can make a difference. One problem in the eurozone, he says, is the poor supply of credit to small firms. A good, healthy ABS market would be useful...we believe the ECB programme can help by developing that market, he adds. Another question on Ukraine. The IMF hopes that there will be an \u201ceasing\u201d of tensions soon, that would allow a bounceback next year. But for 2014 it expects a sharp contraction, although not as bad as other authorities have predicted. What is that IMF\u2019s view of the Egyptian economy? Not much change since April, it\u2019s still a difficult situation. What is the IMF\u2019s view of the impact of the Ukraine crisis on Russia\u2019s economy? The sanctions have made a difficult situation worse, says the IMF\u2019s Thomas Helbling. Looking forward, we don\u2019t expect any fast change on that situation to make Russia a more attractive place to invest. And Germany? There are suggestions that Germany\u2019s confidence has been hit... we\u2019ll need to see the next investment figures for more detail, Helbling adds. Olivier Blanchard is taking questions now. Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott asks whether the IMF believes the world economy is stuck in a \u2018secular stagnation\u2019, or is it simply paying the price for borrowing growth from the future in the run-up to the crisis. Blanchard says that he agrees that potential growth is lower than in the early years of the last decade. \u201cThe evidence is there\u201d. Whether we can get back to those previous levels, we don\u2019t know yet. There is a risk that we don\u2019t. But he\u2019s less convinced by the argument that interest rates need to be maintained at record low levels for the foreseeable future, to stoke up demand. Olivier Blanchard is identifying three key risks: 1) the \u201csearch for yield\u201d in the financial markets, after years of low interest rates, may have stoked up risks for the future. 2) Geopolitical risks have become \u201cmore relevant\u201d. The IMF reckons that the Ukraine crisis has not (yet) had measurable effects beyond the affected countries and their immediate neighbours. And the Middle East turmoil has not (yet) driven up oil prices. But the dangers are there... 3) The risk is a stalling of the recovery in the euro area, dragging it into deflation. The IMF has cut its forecast for emerging market economies. Blanchard says: For emerging market economies as a whole, potential growth is now forecast to be 1.5% lower than it was in 2011. Blanchard says that while Japan\u2019s economy s growing, its high public debt and \u201cvery low potential growth rate\u201d is a \u201cmajor macroeconomic and fiscal challenges\u201d. Japan\u2019s debt/GDP ratio is now over 200%, so very hard to reduce without strong growth Over in Washington, IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard is presenting the World Economic Outlook now (live feed here). Blanchard says that the headline estimate for global growth disguises the fact that \u201csome countries have recovered or nearly recovered. But others are still struggling\u201d. Great Britain and America are leading the way, Blanchard says, with a serious caveat: Among advanced countries, the United States and the United Kingdom in particular are leaving the financial crisis behind and achieving decent growth. Even for them however, potential growth is lower than it was in the early 2000s. But he singles out the eurozone as a laggard: Growth in the euro area nearly stalled earlier this year, even in the core. While this reflects in part temporary factors, both legacies, primarily in the south, and low potential growth, nearly everywhere, are playing a role in slowing down the recovery..... The new World Economic Outlook is packed with charts - my colleague Julia Kollewe has pulled together some important ones, here: IMF downgrades global growth forecasts \u2013 the key charts The IMF is also warning that the world economy might never return to the pace of expansion seen before the financial crisis. From Washington, economics editor Larry Elliott writes: In its flagship half-yearly World Economic Outlook, the Fund said the failure of countries to recover strongly from the worst recession of the post-war era meant there was a risk of stagnation or persistently weak activity. The IMF said it expected global growth to be 3.3% in 2014, 0.4 points lower than it was predicting in the April WEO and 0.1 points down on interim forecasts made in July. A pick up in the rate of expansion to 3.8% is forecast for 2015, down from 3.9% in the April WEO and 4% in July. But the Fund highlighted the risk that its predictions would once again be too optimistic. \u201cThe pace of global recovery has disappointed in recent years\u201d, the IMF said, noting that since 2010 it had been consistently forced to revise down its forecasts. \u201cWith weaker-than-expected global growth for the first half of 2014 and increased downside risks, the projected pickup in growth may again fail to materialise or fall short of expectation.\u201d Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s full story: IMF says economic growth may never return to pre-crisis levels The IMF also reckons that the UK will outperform the rest of Europe, with 3.2% in 2014, dropping to 2.7% in 2015. Breaking News: The International Monetary Fund has cut its growth forecasts, and warned that the world economy might never return to the pace of expansion seen before the financial crisis. The IMF now expects world growth to be 3.3% in 2014, down 0.1% from its July forecast, and 3.8% in 2015, down 0.2% from three month ago. It warns that \u201can uneven global recovery continues\u201d , and admits that the pace of the global recovery has disappointed in recent years. In its new World Economic Outlook, just released, the IMF also warns that the markets are underpricing risk, and that geopolitical risks have increased. It says: Financial markets have been optimistic, with higher equity prices, compressed spreads, and very low volatility. However, this has not translated into a pickup in investment, which\u2014particularly in advanced economies\u2014has remained subdued. And there are concerns that markets are underpricing risk, not fully internalizing the uncertainties surrounding the macroeconomic outlook and their implications for the pace of withdrawal of monetary stimulus in some major advanced economies. Geopolitical tensions have risen. So far their macroeconomic effects appear mostly confined to the regions involved, but there are tangible risks of more widespread disruptions Lots more detail and reaction to follow... The IMF will hold a press conference conference to discuss its new world economic outlook at 2pm BST (9am in Washington). It\u2019s being streamed live, here (right-click to open in a new tab). Heads-up..... in 15 minutes time the International Monetary Fund will release its latest World Economic Outlook, over in Washington. Brace yourselves for new growth forecasts, charts, predictions on the state of the world economy..... Ouch. Fizz purveyor SodaStream has warned that revenues in the third quarter are below expectations, due to weaker-than-expected demand in the US. CEO Daniel Birnbaum didn\u2019t sweeten the pill, admitting that: We are very disappointed in our recent performance. Shares in SodaStream, the Israeli company which operates a factory in the Palestinian West Bank, are expected to tumble around 16% when Wall Street opens. Elsewhere in the Square Mile, Bloomberg is reporting that Dutch financial group Rabobank has suspended two London-based foreign exchange traders, after an internal investigation into their dealings. New rules that could see senior bankers jailed appear to have prompted two senior executives at HSBC\u2019s UK arm to leave. Reuters has the story: Two directors of HSBC\u2019s British business are set to leave the bank because they are unhappy with new rules that can result in jail sentences for senior bankers, a source familiar with the matter said. Alan Thomson, a member of the audit and risk committees of HSBC Bank Plc, has tendered his resignation from the bank and John Trueman, the deputy chairman of HSBC Bank Plc, is on the verge of resigning, the source said. Sky News reported on Tuesday that the likely departures of both men were a direct consequence of new proposals to strengthen accountability for senior bankers. The Bank of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority, announced in late July that bankers would be criminally liable if their reckless led to a bank failing. The new rules, which could come into force next year, would also force bankers to prove they had acted appropriately. New tough tests on competence, personal conduct and ethical behaviour for top bankers are also planned. Bob Rice, managing partner at New York-based Tangent Capital, reckons the slump in German industrial production is tied in with the weak inflation across Europe (which creates less demand for new goods) This morning\u2019s weak German industrial data is the latest in a series of worrying signals. As this chart shows, the monthly PMI reports (which measure activity in the sector) have also shown a slowdown in recent months. Time to catch-up. Economists fear that Germany is sliding into recession, after industrial production across Europe\u2019s largest economy tumbled by an alarming 4.0% in August, compared with July. It\u2019s the biggest monthly fall since the aftermath of Lehman Brothers\u2019 collapse reverberated through the global economy. Carsten Brzeski of ING warned that it is \u201ctoo early to tell\u201d whether Germany will avoid a technical recession. And even if it does, the remaining months of 2014 look very challenging. Berenberg bank cautioned that a \u201cmild recession\u201d cannot be ruled out. Reaction starts here The German economy ministry itself said that the \u201cIndustrial production is currently going through a weak phase\u201d, with output of heavy duty machinery tumbling by almost 9%. August\u2019s weak reading partly due to summer holidays being later than usual. But even accounting for that, the German economy could be in trouble. Ralph Solveen, economist at Commerzbank, says (via the FT): \u201cThe trend is pointing down, with the German economy in the third quarter likely to have stagnated at best.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: German recession fears grow with latest industry data The euro continued to slide in the foreign exchange markets; now down 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.2587. New data has also shown that Britain\u2019s industrial sector slowed in August. Manufacturing output grew by just 0.1%, and industrial production was flat overall. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at German bank Berenberg, believes tensions between Russia and the west over Ukraine are hurting the UK industrial based: \u201cUK manufacturing is entering a soft patch as the fall-out from events in Ukraine spreads. Ukraine and Russia are of little direct importance to UK exporters. But the manufacturing cycle is highly integrated across countries. That means the decline in business confidence and German manufacturing output triggered by Russia\u2019s aggression in Eastern Ukraine will continue to spread to the UK over the second half of the year.\u201d Full story: UK manufacturing growth up just 0.1% in August In other news.... Europe\u2019s stock markets have all fallen today, driven down by the weak German data and geopolitical tensions. Round-up. Spain\u2019s IBEX is down 1.5%, following the news that a nurse in Madrid had become the first person to contract ebola outside Africa. Shares in mining giant Rio Tinto have surged 5% after it revealed it had rejected takeover overtures from rival Glencore. Tesco has suspended a fifth executive, as the probe into how it overstated its profits by \u00a3250m continues. And the Bank of England has predicted that a price war could break out in the UK mortgage market, after lenders saw a sharp drop in loan availability over the summer. More here: Mortgage price war expected as UK lenders fight for market share The slowdown in UK manufacturing growth in August (details) hasn\u2019t helped the sentiment in the financial markets. All Europe\u2019s main stock indices are in the red, as traders absorb the warning that Germany could be falling into recession. Here\u2019s the situation: The US market is expected to follow suit this afternoon, with the Dow being called down 82 ppints. Joao Monteiro, analyst at Valutrades, explains: Wall Street is eyeing a weaker start to the day\u2019s trade, both off the back of this lead from Asia but also given what appears to be a deteriorating geopolitical situation. The Ebola crisis continues to spread, whilst the fact Islamic State is now active on the Syrian/Turkish border is also significant cause for concern. In other news this morning, Tesco has suspended its fifth executive as the investigation into its \u00a3250m profit mis-statement continues. It\u2019s understood to be group commercial director Kevin Grace. Tesco suspends another executive after profits debacle My colleague Simon Bowers tweets: Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, warns that the UK factory recovery is fragile: \u201cThe slowdown in growth levels should not mask the reality that the manufacturing sector continues to grow although at a far more restrained level than we witnessed in the first half of the year. However, although there is still an optimistic outlook amongst manufacturers helped by easing price pressures in the sector, there is a fragility to the recovery which needs a powerful shot in the arm from both a boost in export orders as well as more investment in new product development and process enhancements.\u201d Britain\u2019s factory sector appears to have lost momentum, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight, following the meagre 0.1% rise in manufacturing output in August. Geopolitics, and the troubles in Europe, are to blame, he reckons: Weak Eurozone activity is clearly having a limiting impact on foreign demand for UK manufacturing goods. The recent strength of the pound has not helped UK manufacturing exports. In addition, it is possible that current heightened geopolitical tensions and the weakness in the Eurozone is increasing business caution and causing some orders to be delayed or even cancelled. And this chart, also from today\u2019s UK production report, shows how industrial output in all major economies is still smaller than before the financial crisis began. Output in Italy and France remained 23.4% (!!) and 16.5% (!) below respective pre- downturn levels, according to the Office for National Statistics, while the US remained 0.5% shy of its 08-09 peak, The full report is here. This chart shows how Britain\u2019s industrial sector was hit hard by the great recession: Here we go.... UK factory output was flat in August, down from 0.5% growth the previous month. It\u2019s another sign that global manufacturing slowed over the summer; but also rather better than Germany\u2019s 4% slump. Output in the narrower UK manufacturing sector inched up by 0.1% month-on-month, down from 0.3% growth in July, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics. On an annual basis, UK industrial output was 2.5% higher in August 2014 than August 2013, with manufacturing growing by 3.9%. So it\u2019s not been a bad 12 months for industry.... ... but, the data also show that Britain\u2019s manufacturing base has still not recovered its pre-crisis levels. Production output is still 9.6% lower than the peak in 2008, and manufacturing was 4.4% lower. More to follow... European stock markets have fallen following today\u2019s weak German factory data. The German DAX and French CAC are both down around 0.7%, with the FTSE 100 down 35 points or -0.5% (despite mining rallying). OK, it\u2019s nearly time to find out how Britain\u2019s factories fared in August. The UK industrial output data is due at 9.30am BST, and will show if manufacturers here shared Germany\u2019s struggles. Economists predict that industrial output was flat month-on-month, having grown by 0.5% in July.... Phillip Inman, The Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent, reminds us that Germany has already rebuffed calls to increase government investment spending to boost the economy and drive growth in the eurozone. Inman says: \u201cLast week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) singled out Berlin for falling behind on infrastructure spending in a report that argued well targeted investments can pay back three times the initial cost. IMF urges greater infrastructure spending after 30-year decline US Treasury secretary Jack Lew has also urged Germany to lead the eurozone out of its current morass with extra spending, especially as the government has boasted of its budget surplus. But finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has consistently rebuffed these calls, rejecting Keynesian policies to boost higher public spending in Germany and elsewhere in Europe in favour of painful structural reforms. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t allow ourselves to entertain the illusion that we can solve our problems using more and more public funds and ever higher deficits,\u201d he said. \u201cCalls in Europe to use ever more public funds and higher deficits and debts are misleading. Growth and jobs are not created through ever higher deficits - otherwise we would have no problems now.\u201d The problem for Sch\u00e4uble is that he has also rejected further stimulus by the European Central Bank, telling its president Mario Draghi that Europe\u2019s banks are awash with cheap cash, making any plans for quantitative easing irrelevant.\u201d More reaction... You can see this morning\u2019s alarming Germany\u2019s industrial output data here, on the Destatis website. It explains how the 4% slide in production was driven by an 8.8% drop in the manufacturer of \u2018capital goods\u2019 (big-ticket items like machinery and cars). Production of intermediate goods (used to make other finished products) fell by 1.9%. Consumer goods production fell by 0.4%, and construction production was down by 2.0%. Germany isn\u2019t alone.... New data from the Czech Republic shows that its factory production also fell in August. Czech industrial output shrank by 3.6% month-on-month in August, and was 5.2% lower than the year before. Car production was down by 13.4% year-on-year. Analysts at Berenberg bank have warned that the the 4% tumble in German industrial output in August may indicate that Europe\u2019s largest economy is being dragged into recession That echoes ING\u2019s warning earlier this morning. Berenberg say: Even if the decline in business confidence triggered by Russia\u2019s aggression in Eastern Ukraine were to end in the coming months, we cannot even rule out a mild recession on the back of this data. A significant rebound in manufacturing, and thus investment, is unlikely to come through before early 2015. Reminder, German\u2019s economy shrank by 0.2% in April-June quarter, so it\u2019s halfway into a technical recession.... Berenberg also point out that the German school holidays started later than usual this year. That meant more people would have been on vacation in August, encouraging factories to shut down then rather than in July (when production rose 1.6%). So there are seasonal factors to consider here. In the City, shares in Rio Tinto soared by over 5% in early trading, following the news that it rejected a takeover approach from rival miner Glencore in August. Shares in Anglo American, another mining giant, are up 2% as investors anticipate an outbreak of takeover activity in the sector. Looking at the detail of the German industrial output data.... production of new cars slumped by over 25% month-on-month in August. Monthly factory output can be volatile. But as this chart shows, Germany\u2019s factory production had been bobbing around between +2% and -2% for the last couple of years, until August.... The euro has lost ground since the German industrial output data was released; down 0.2% against the US dollar at $1.2624. Analysts are stunned by the 4% slump in German industrial production in August. Carsten Brzeski of ING says that geopolitical tensions, and the summer slowdown, proved a dangerous combination: Such a shocking number normally leads to two possible reactions: either an outcry of shock, or just denying the numbers due to monthly volatility or one-offs. Looking at the German numbers, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle. The sharp drop in August could at least be partly driven by the vacation period. However, the drop is too strong to explain it by one-offs. This means that increased uncertainty but also real slowing of the Eurozone economy, Eastern European economies and emerging markets are all currently taking their toll on the German economy. Brzeski went on to warn that Germany could have slid into recession (it contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter of 2014), and the outlook is \u201cdifficult\u201d. Looking beyond the third quarter, the German industry is looking into a more difficult future. The safety net of inventories and orders at hand has narrowed in recent months. Inventory build-up combined with dropping new orders does not bode well for industrial production in the fourth quarter. \u201cThat hurts\u201d, tweets Frederik Ducrozet of Credit Agricole: And Duncan Weldon, economics correspondent at the BBC\u2019s Newsnight, agrees that the news from Germany is worrying: Serious news out of Germany this morning -- industrial output across Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse has tumbled at a pace not seen in five and a half-years. German industrial output fell by 4.0% month-on-month in August, according to data just released by the Economy Ministry. That\u2019s the biggest fall since early 2009, and much worse than the lowest estimates from economists. It adds to fears that the eurozone economy is weakening. Germany is also feeling the impact of the sanctions between the West and Russia over the Ukraine crisis. The Ministry said that the slump in output was partly due to summer holidays but there\u2019s not doubt that Germany\u2019s factory sector is suffering. In a statement, it said: \u201cIndustrial production is currently going through a weak phase ...but the current decline is exacerbated by holiday effects.\u201d \u201cAll in all, one should expect weak production for the third quarter as a whole.\u201d It\u2019s the second piece of bad German economic data in as many days -- yesterday we learned that industrial orders slumped by 5.7% in August, suggesting leaner times ahead. That fall was also the biggest since 2009.... Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. Today\u2019s big story will be the International Monetay Fund\u2019s new World Economic Outlook, released at 2pm BST (or 9am Washington). The IMF will release its new economic forecasts, and early leaks have suggested that it will cut some growth estimates. In particular, Germany\u2019s growth rate for this year and 2015 could be trimmed back: IMF cuts German growth estimates to 1.5% Also coming up today.... The mining sector is aflutter, after Rio Tinto announced overnight that it had rejected a takeover approach from Glencore. Both companies shares jumped on the Australian stock market. It\u2019s been a busy day down under - the Australian Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged, and hinted that they could stay unchanged for a while. Reserve Bank leaves interest rates on hold at 2.5% despite falling dollar Economic data-wise, we get the latest UK industrial production data for August at 9.30am - that\u2019ll show how British factories fared over the summer. And at 3pm BST the NIESR think-tank will give its new estimate for UK growth in the third quarter of this year. And, as usual, we\u2019ll have an eye on Greece, where the government has called a vote of confidence for next week in a bid to ward off an early election.....",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economic recovery lost steam in the third quarter with growth of 0.7%, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. NIESR\u2019s estimate reflects a slight slowdown compared with the second quarter, when gross domestic product increased by 0.9%. If correct, it would mean the UK economy is 3.1% bigger than it was in the third quarter of 2013. Simon Kirby, principal research fellow at the thinktank, said 0.7% was still a reasonable quarterly increase. \u201cGrowth rates move around from quarter to quarter. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised to see growth moderate somewhat from the very robust rate in the preceding quarter. It\u2019s a story of continuing economic recovery.\u201d Kirby said manufacturing was holding back the UK economy, after the latest data from the Office for National Statistic (ONS) showed the sector barely grew in August. Manufacturing output increased by just 0.1% over the month, while the broader measure of industrial production was flat. Kirby said there were a number of risks to the UK recovery. \u201cThe eurozone is the biggest risk because it is the UK\u2019s main trading partner. It is intertwined with our economic fortune, certainly in the short term.\u201d The UK economy is now 3.5% larger than it was at its previous peak in January 2008, according to NIESR\u2019s estimates. However, it said there was still a \u201creasonable amount\u201d of spare capacity in the UK economy to be used up before the Bank of England starts raising interest rates. NIESR expects the first increase in February 2015. Members of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee will announce its October policy decision on Thursday. Economists widely expect rates to remain on hold at 0.5%, where they have been since March 2009, amid weak wage growth and signs that growth is slowing. The ONS figures on factory output reflected the trend of slowing manufacturing growth indicated by the Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI last week. UK manufacturing has yet to fully recover from the financial crisis, with the sector 4.4% below its 2008 peak, according to the ONS. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at the German bank Berenberg, said tensions between Russia and the west over Ukraine were indirectly having an impact on the sector. \u201cUK manufacturing is entering a soft patch as the fallout from events in Ukraine spreads. Ukraine and Russia are of little direct importance to UK exporters. But the manufacturing cycle is highly integrated across countries. That means the decline in business confidence and German manufacturing output triggered by Russia\u2019s aggression in eastern Ukraine will continue to spread to the UK over the second half of the year.\u201d Despite the poor monthly performance, recent large-scale revisions of historic data by the ONS suggested manufacturing fared better on an annual basis than previously thought. Manufacturing output in the year to August was up 3.9%. Industrial production, which includes mining and utilities as well as manufacturing, grew by 2.5% over the year, but production remained 9.6% smaller than its pre-crisis peak.",

      "bodyText": "It's the economy what done it. That, and Ebola. A combination of bad news from the latest data and the spread of the Ebola virus to Spain sent shares tumbling once more. Things could have been worse, if not for takeover action in the mining sector which helped to limit the damage. The FTSE 100 finished down 68.07 points at 6495.58, with travel companies falling sharply on the virus news, on the basis that travel restrictions could be enforced, even supposing people want to leave their own countries.

Hotels group Intercontinental Hotels was also unwanted, down 85p to \u00a322.44. On the economic front, sentiment was hit by a shock 4.0% month-on-month drop in German industrial production in August, compared to a forecast fall of 1.5%, raising the prospect of recession in the eurozone powerhouse. Later came news the International Monetary Fund had cut its global growth forecasts. It now expects world growth to be 3.3% in 2014, down 0.1% from its July forecast, and 3.8% in 2015, down 0.2% from three month ago. There are also the continuing geopolitical tensions to unsettle investors: the protests in Hong Kong, the troubles in Ukraine, not to mention air strikes on Isis. But mining shares were in focus after news that Glencore, down 8.3p at 331.05p, had approached Rio Tinto, up 23.5p at 3020.5p, about a merger.

      "bodyText": "Two directors of HSBC\u2019s UK bank are poised to quit in protest at new Bank of England rules that could make directors and top executives criminally liable if a bank fails. Alan Thomson, who is on the audit and risk committees of HSBC Bank plc will leave this month; John Trueman the UK operation\u2019s deputy chairman, plans to resign soon, Sky News reported. Their departures are said to be linked to proposals by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), the Bank of England\u2019s regulatory division, to make senior bankers more accountable. HSBC will file a notice about Thomson\u2019s resignation with Companies House this month, with Trueman\u2019s following later if he confirms he is leaving. The PRA is seeking opinions this month on rule changes that would make bank bosses liable if they take reckless decisions that cause the bank to collapse. Thomson and Trueman are said to have reconsidered their jobs after they were briefed by HSBC compliance officers after the PRA\u2019s announcement of its proposals in July. Thomson cited his other commitments, which include chairing Hays, the recruitment company, as another reason for resigning. Trueman has been a director of HSBC Bank for 10 years and was an investment banker before that. Thomson, a former finance director at Smiths Group, the engineering company, joined HSBC\u2019s UK board in December. The PRA\u2019s paper, published jointly with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), proposed a \u201csenior managers\u2019 regime\u201d with powers to jail top bankers for up to seven years for reckless misconduct. Board directors and top executives would be given clear responsibilities and would have to prove they were not aware of or had challenged improper behaviour at the time. The parliamentary commission on banking standards recommended a criminal offence of reckless conduct when it reported last year. Its findings reflected widespread anger that no top bankers have been charged or imprisoned for actions that made them rich but brought the economy close to collapse. Andrew Tyrie, who chaired the commission, was unfazed by the expected departures at HSBC. \u201cThe crisis showed that there must be much greater individual responsibility in banking. A buck that does not stop with an individual often stops nowhere. The new senior managers regime will require banks to identify who is responsible for what at the very top. Implementation will require banks and regulators to exercise their judgment.\u201d A lawyer at a top City firm said the departures at HSBC were not a surprise as there was concern about potential sanctions against bank directors. But he said the threat of criminal action would remain remote if the rules were introduced. \u201cCriminal liability is only incurred if knowledge can be demonstrated. If you\u2019re a more or less diligent director paying attention, you don\u2019t need to think: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m in grave danger\u2019,\u201d said the lawyer, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity. A new standard of care introduced by the FCA is a greater threat to bank directors than the chance of criminal charges because it gives the regulator a great deal of flexibility to decide what to punish, the lawyer added. Banks are complaining that the post-crisis regulatory clampdown has gone too far by stifling their ability to lend and deterring candidates from joining their boards. But the banks\u2019 critics accuse them of lobbying to escape the consequences of actions that caused the financial meltdown.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cut its global growth forecasts for 2014 and 2015 and warned that the world economy may never return to the pace of expansion seen before the financial crisis. In its flagship half-yearly world economic outlook (WEO), the IMF said the failure of countries to recover strongly from the worst recession of the postwar era meant there was a risk of stagnation or persistently weak activity. The IMF said it expected global growth to be 3.3% in 2014, 0.4 points lower than it was predicting in the April WEO and 0.1 points down on interim forecasts made in July. A pick-up in the rate of expansion to 3.8% is forecast for 2015, down from 3.9% in the April WEO and 4% in July. But the IMF highlighted the risk that its predictions would once again be too optimistic. \u201cThe pace of global recovery has disappointed in recent years\u201d, the IMF said, noting that since 2010 it had been consistently forced to revise down its forecasts. \u201cWith weaker-than-expected global growth for the first half of 2014 and increased downside risks, the projected pickup in growth may again fail to materialise or fall short of expectation.\u201d The IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, Olivier Blanchard, said the three main short-term risks were that financial markets were too complacent about the future; tensions between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East; and that a triple-dip recession in the eurozone could lead to deflation. Although the IMF believes the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England will be the first two major central banks to start raising interest rates by the middle of 2015, it advised that official borrowing costs should be kept low so long as demand remained weak. It added that countries with healthy public finances, such as Germany, should spend more on infrastructure in order to boost growth and cautioned against over-aggressive attempts to reduce budget deficits. From a medium-term perspective, low potential output growth and \u201csecular stagnation\u201d are still important risks, given that robust demand growth has not yet emerged. \u201cIn particular, despite continued very low interest rates and increased risk appetite in financial markets, a pick-up in investment has not yet materialised, possibly reflecting concerns about low medium-term potential growth rates and subdued private consumption (in a context of weak growth in median incomes).\u201d Japan and the euro area were most at risk of stagnation, the WEO said. \u201cIn such a situation, some affected countries would not be able to generate the demand needed to restore full employment through regular self-correcting forces.\u201d The IMF said the outlook was brighter in the US and the UK, which were \u201cleaving the crisis behind and achieving decent growth\u201d. Britain is forecast to see its gross domestic product increase by 3.2% in 2014 \u2013 up 0.3 points from the April WEO and the fastest of any G7 nation. America\u2019s slow start to 2014 means, according to the IMF, that it will expand by 2.2% this year, rising to 3.1% in 2015 \u2013 faster than Britain\u2019s 2.7%. Blanchard said, however, that even in the two biggest Anglo-Saxon economies potential growth rates were lower than in the early 2000s. Euro area growth is predicted to be 0.8% in 2014, rising to 1.3% next year. Japan\u2019s high level of public debt and ageing population mean it will grow by less than 1% in both years, the IMF said. Blanchard said there was a possibility that ultra-low growth in the euro area could turn into deflation, a period of falling prices that would make debts more expensive to service. \u201cThis is not our baseline (forecast), because we believe euro area fundamentals are slowing improving. But should such a scenario play out, it would be the major issue confronting the global economy.\u201d The IMF said the slowdown in growth was affecting not just the west but also emerging markets such as China, Russia and Brazil.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England will need to consider raising interest rates to rein in Britain\u2019s housing market if controls designed to curb risky lending prove insufficient to see off the threat to financial stability, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said. While suggesting that Threadneedle Street keep rates at 0.5% for now, the Washington-based IMF made it clear it was carefully watching the UK for signs of a new property bubble developing. It expressed some reservations about whether limits on mortgage lending announced by the Bank in recent months would be enough to prevent another damaging property bubble. But it warned that the Bank would have to be cautious in deploying its biggest weapon because of the possibility of damage to the wider economy. Last week, the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee said it wanted statutory powers to compel lenders to limit the size of a home loan both in relation to the value of the property and the income of the borrower. But in its half-yearly world economic outlook (WEO), the IMF said buoyant housing markets were posing policy challenges in a number of western countries, including the UK. \u201cHouse prices, however, have increased by 10% across the country \u2013 in London, more than double that \u2013 and household debt, at 140% of gross disposable income, remains high,\u201d it said. The IMF noted that the Bank had started to use so-called macro-prudential tools, specific controls designed to cool down the housing market without collateral damage on the rest of the economy. It added: \u201cTighter monetary conditions could also be considered if macro-prudential tools prove ineffective at addressing financial stability concerns, but careful consideration would need to be given to the trade-off between damage to the real economy and the ultimate costs of financial vulnerabilities.\u201d With only two members of the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee voting for a rate rise, the IMF said it did not expect to see the first increase in official borrowing costs until the \u201cfirst half of 2015\u201d. It said it expected the process to be smooth, without large or protracted disturbances in financial markets and sharp upward movements in long-term interest rates. \u201cIn the UK, activity has rebounded and become more balanced, driven by both consumption and business investment, thanks to improving credit and financial market conditions and healthy corporate balance sheets. Growth is projected to average 3.2% in 2014 and 2.7% in 2015, about a quarter of a percentage point stronger than forecast in the April 2014 WEO,\u201d the IMF said. Britain is expected to be the second fastest-growing economy in western Europe after Ireland this year, according to the IMF. But despite a rapid fall in unemployment \u2013 forecast to tumble to 6.3%, the IMF said there was still slack in the labour market. The Bank has been surprised that wage pressures in the UK have remained weak despite the drop in the jobless total. The IMF said the lack of earnings growth and an inflation rate below the government\u2019s 2% target meant there was no immediate pressure on the MPC to act. \u201cIn the UK, given weak price and wage pressures, monetary policy should stay accommodative for now, but it may need to be tightened quickly if inflation rises.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Fears that Germany is on the brink of recession intensified after the eurozone\u2019s largest economy suffered its biggest slump in industrial output since the beginning of the financial crisis. The German economy contracted in the second quarter and economists believe it will have struggled to grow in the third or may possibly have shrunk again. Concerns that the country could have entered technical recession \u2013 defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 were fanned by news on Tuesday that industrial output in August slumped 4%. That was more than twice the decline of 1.5% that had been forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. The drop was the biggest since January 2009, underlining the fact that, more than five years on from the financial crisis, Europe\u2019s biggest economy is struggling to shake off the damage done by recession. The German economy ministry sought to highlight the effect of later summer holidays, which boosted July, but admitted there was also underlying weakness. \u201cIndustrial production is currently going through a weak phase \u2026 but the current decline is exacerbated by holiday effects,\u201d it said. \u201cAll in all, one should expect weak production for the third quarter.\u201d The disappointing figures follow data on Monday showing German industrial orders plunged in August, again by the biggest amount since 2009. News of weak demand raised fears about not only the summer but also the closing quarter of the year. \u201cAnother shocker\u201d was how Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING Financial Markets, described the latest numbers on output. \u201cThe sharp drop in August could at least be partly driven by the vacation period. However, the drop is too strong to explain it by one-offs. This means that increased uncertainty but also real slowing of the eurozone economy, eastern European economies and emerging markets are all currently taking their toll on the German economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe short-term outlook for the economy is very diffuse as the strong labour market and solid private consumption should be able to, at least partly, offset weaker industrial activity. Whether this will be enough to avoid a technical recession, ie another contraction in the third quarter, is with today\u2019s industrial production numbers too early to tell. Looking beyond the third quarter, the German industry is looking into a more difficult future.\u201d Economists said the latest signs of weakness in the eurozone could well prompt more calls for the European central bank (ECB) to step up action to revive the region. Faced with the threat of deflation and tumbling business confidence as the Ukraine crisis continues, the ECB has cut lending and deposit rates and announced a programme to buy asset-backed securities. But it has stopped short of embarking on full-scale quantitative easing (QE) which would potentially involve the bank purchasing government debt. Christian Schulz, senior economist at the German bank Berenberg, said talk of QE could soon return. The continued decline in German industrial production confirmed his expectation that GDP \u201cwill probably not grow much in the second half of the year\u201d, he said. \u201cA significant rebound in manufacturing and thus investment is unlikely to come through before early 2015. That could force the ECB to revise down forecasts again in December and trigger a new debate about more easing measures, including US-style purchases of sovereign bonds,\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Rio Tinto raced ahead more than 5% in London on Tuesday after the miner rejected a merger approach from smaller rival Glencore. A tie-up between the two would create the world\u2019s biggest mining group, ahead of BHP Billiton, and valued at \u00a3100bn. Rio shares jumped 5.5% to \u00a331.57 in early trading, adding \u00a33.1bn to the company\u2019s market value. Other miners also gained ground \u2013 Anglo American was up 3% at \u00a313.82, Antofogasta added 1.1% to 714.5p, Fresnillo rose 1.3% to 755p, BHP gained nearly 1% to \u00a316.93 and Randgold Resources rose 0.7% to 41.84p. Glencore edged down before trading marginally higher at 339.85p, a 0.2% gain. In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, Rio reiterated that no talks were taking place with Glencore, which made its approach on a potential merger in July. Bloomberg reported on Monday that Glencore had approached its largest shareholder, Chinese state-owned Aluminium Corp of China (Chinalco), to sound out its interest in a potential deal \u201cin recent weeks\u201d. Chinalco owns 9.8% of Rio. \u201cThe Rio Tinto board, after consultation with its financial and legal advisers, concluded unanimously that a combination was not in the best interests of Rio Tinto\u2019s shareholders,\u201d the company said, echoing a statement made to the Australian stock exchange on Monday. \u201cThe board\u2019s rejection was communicated to Glencore in early August and there has been no further contact between the companies on this matter.\u201d The price of iron ore, Rio\u2019s most profitable product, fell towards a five-year low at the time. Iron ore would fill a gap in Glencore\u2019s portfolio of commodities. RBC Capital Markets analyst Timothy Huff said: \u201cA potential merger with Rio would enable Glencore to get hold of the lowest-cost iron ore business in Australia. This is likely just a shot across the bow from Glencore and we expect Glencore to play the long game with any highly desired acquisition target. While asset divestments may have to play a larger part in a Glencore/Rio tie-up, we think the broader strategy for an enlarged group makes sense.\u201d Glencore\u2019s boss, Ivan Glasenberg, is thought to be keen on more acquisitions, after last year\u2019s controversial purchase of Xstrata, the biggest deal in the sector. Huff thinks any regulatory hurdles could be overcome. \u201cAny antitrust hurdles will likely be limited to copper and thermal coal. As Glencore demonstrated with the Xstrata acquisition, it should be able to overcome any antitrust issues via divestitures of select assets.\u201d Analysts at Bernstein wrote last month: \u201cA Rio Tinto-Glencore combination would create market-leading positions in iron ore, copper, nickel, zinc and coal as well as significant optionality around a number of lesser metals and minerals. Moreover, it would create the biggest and most diversified mining company on the planet.\u201d",

Manufacturing output increased by just 0.1% over the month according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), further frustrating government ambitions of rebalancing the economy away from consumer spending and towards production and exports. It compared with a 0.3% increase in July. The manufacture of metals, wood and paper were among the drivers of August\u2019s modest growth. UK manufacturing has yet to fully recover from the blow dealt by the financial crisis, with the sector 4.4% below its 2008 peak. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at the German bank Berenberg, said, indirectly, the tensions between Russia and the west over Ukraine were having an impact on the sector. \u201cUK manufacturing is entering a soft patch as the fallout from events in Ukraine spreads. Ukraine and Russia are of little direct importance to UK exporters. But the manufacturing cycle is highly integrated across countries. That means the decline in business confidence and German manufacturing output triggered by Russia\u2019s aggression in eastern Ukraine will continue to spread to the UK over the second half of the year.\u201d Wood forecast economic growth of 0.6% in the third quarter, following 0.9% in the second. The first official estimate will be published by the ONS on 24 October. Despite the poor monthly performance, recent large-scale revisions to historic data by the ONS suggested manufacturing fared better on an annual basis than previously thought. Manufacturing output in the year to August was up 3.9%. The wider measure of industrial production, which includes mining and utilities as well as manufacturing, was flat in August, following 0.4% growth in July.

Meanwhile AstraZeneca has fallen 72p to \u00a342.93 despite Monday's news that its blood thinning drug Brilinta had won preferred status in the US. Panmure Gordon Savvas Neophytou said: We acknowledge news of improved positioning of Brilinta in new treatment guidelines. This results in some 7.8% upgrade to our 2015 forecast. We upgrade the stock to buy (from hold) and set a new price target of \u00a347.00 (from \u00a344.00).",

This means that the Abbott and Napthine governments have signed contracts and pledged over $3.5bn before that assessment has been conducted. It was a curious way to display the LNP\u2019s campaign promise to \u201cempower Infrastructure Australia to deliver better value from infrastructure spending\u201d. Especially since they also promised that \u201call commonwealth-funded projects worth more than $100m would be required to undergo a cost-benefit analysis by Infrastructure Australia\u201d. Even worse, in last year\u2019s State of Play report, IA noted that there was a lack of \u201ca framework designed for nationally significant\u201d road infrastructure and that there also needed to be further work done to ensure \u201ccoordinated planning and transparent investment decisions\u201d. With the Victorian state election just eight weeks away, it is pretty transparent that the East West Link decision was based less on economic benefits and more on the hope that, just as it is for Abbott and Napthine, Victorian voters will view the road project as one of their favourite things.",
