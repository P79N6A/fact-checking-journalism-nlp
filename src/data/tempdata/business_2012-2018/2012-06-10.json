      "bodyText": "The government will not block BAA from submitting proposals for a third Heathrow runway in a forthcoming revamp of policy on aviation hubs, in a move that heads off the threat of legal action by the airport owner. A senior representative of the London mayor, Boris Johnson, said the government would allow BAA to push for expansion of Britain's largest airport. Daniel Moylan, the mayor's aviation policy chief, said it did not mean a third runway was back on the government's policy agenda. \"Boris Johnson understands that for legal reasons the government is going to have to allow examination of every option. But this should not be taken as expressing a preference for a third runway,\" said Moylan. Johnson is the most prominent political backer of a new airport in the south-east, with options including a new site in the Thames estuary. However, he is against the expansion of Heathrow. The government is launching two aviation documents in July: a consultation on a \"sustainable aviation framework\"; and a request for options on maintaining airport hubs in the UK. If BAA lobbies for a third runway through the latter, according to one industry source, the government could use the principles established in the sustainable aviation study to rule it out emphatically or resurrect it. \"If a third runway at Heathrow can meet requirements for a sustainable aviation policy, it will be sifted through for consideration. If it cannot, it will be sifted out. That is a robust and entirely legal position to take,\" said the source. A senior aviation industry source said the options document would allow for a third runway submission, amid speculation that BAA will seek a judicial review if it is barred from submitting an argument for expansion. \"The document will be carefully worded so as not to exclude any potential options for increasing hub airport capacity,\" said the source. The Department for Transport said the government remained against a third runway. \"The coalition's position regarding Heathrow has not changed,\" it said. The shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, said: \"The only way we are going to get agreement on a long-term strategy is if ministers finally take up our offer to work together on a cross-party basis to develop a sensible alternative to the rejected Heathrow third runway and the unworkable fantasy Thames estuary proposals.\" However, allowing a submission on Heathrow expansion will increase fears among third-runway opponents that senior government figures are nonetheless sympathetic to BAA's case. Those concerns are shared by Johnson's camp, which believes high-profile campaigning by business leaders and Willie Walsh, the boss of International Airlines Group, is having an effect. Johnson is concerned that his lobbying for more airport capacity in the south-east will bolster the campaign for a reversal on Heathrow, instead of boosting his calls for a new airport. Those fears have been stoked by an apparent softening in the vehemence of David Cameron and George Osborne's opposition to new runways in the south-east. The prime minister said in March that he was \"not blind to the need to increase airport capacity, particularly in the south-east\". A few days later, in the budget, Osborne made a pointed call to confront the lack of runways in the London area. Zac Goldsmith, the Tory MP for Richmond, on Sunday reiterated his threat to stand down as an MP if his party backtracked on Heathrow.",

      "body": "<p>There was a certain inevitability about Spain's decision to go cap in hand to Brussels and ask for a loan to help bail out its wrecked banks. Ever since Greece became the first member of the single currency to need assistance, each phase of the eurozone debt crisis has unfolded like a sad piece of classical music with its own distinctive melody.</p> <p>The piece opens slowly. Policymakers in the country under threat deny that they have a problem, a view not shared by the financial markets. In the next movement the pace quickens as the pressure builds on the vulnerable country's bonds. Finally, there is a crescendo as the politicians admit that they are beaten and terms are agreed. There is a stirring passage where politicians claim to have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.</p> <p>It is not quite the end, though, because each piece has its coda. The faint echo of the melody can be heard as the crisis moves on to another eurozone capital.</p> <p>Spain has adhered to this pattern to the letter.

      "bodyText": "There was a certain inevitability about Spain's decision to go cap in hand to Brussels and ask for a loan to help bail out its wrecked banks. Ever since Greece became the first member of the single currency to need assistance, each phase of the eurozone debt crisis has unfolded like a sad piece of classical music with its own distinctive melody. The piece opens slowly. Policymakers in the country under threat deny that they have a problem, a view not shared by the financial markets. In the next movement the pace quickens as the pressure builds on the vulnerable country's bonds. Finally, there is a crescendo as the politicians admit that they are beaten and terms are agreed. There is a stirring passage where politicians claim to have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. It is not quite the end, though, because each piece has its coda. The faint echo of the melody can be heard as the crisis moves on to another eurozone capital. Spain has adhered to this pattern to the letter. The government of Mariano Rajoy said it was on top of the crisis. Tough measures were implemented that were supposed to obviate the need for external assistance. Then it became clear that the problems of the debt-sodden banks were being exacerbated by a deepening recession. Estimates of the cost of recapitalising the banks escalated.

    "webTitle": "George Osborne's recovery via austerity plan is undone amid crisis of capitalism", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Europe's decision to set aside up to \u20ac100bn (\u00a380bn) for bailing out Spain's banks provides a sombre backdrop to the chancellor's annual Mansion House speech on Thursday. George Osborne will tell the City's bigwigs about his plans for banking reform but has still to decide what to say about the state of the economy. Events are simply moving too fast. One thing is for sure, however. This year's address will be a rather less bullish affair than that given in 2007 by Gordon Brown, his swansong after a decade at the Treasury. After heaping praise on the City, Brown predicted that \"it will be said of this age, the first decades of the 21st century, that out of the greatest restructuring of the global economy, perhaps even greater than the industrial revolution, a new world order was created\". To be fair, he was not the only one who believed that the collapse of communism and the spread of the free market to China, India and the former Soviet Union had made low-inflationary, inclusive growth normal. It is now clear that August 2007 marked as abrupt a change in the economic cycle as the Wall Street Crash of 1929. After the markets froze up there was a descent \u2013 punctuated by brief rallies \u2013 into a deep recession from which there has been no genuine recovery. If he sticks to his usual script on Thursday, Osborne will admit that it is taking longer than he expected to turn the economy round but will also insist that abandoning the government's deficit reduction plan would make matters worse. The working assumption is that life will eventually return to normal as it did after the last crisis of a comparable length, the Great Depression of the 1930s. As things stand, this looks a highly questionable assumption, and not just because of fiscal austerity. One tentative conclusion that can be drawn from the events of the past half-decade is that in the west we have been experiencing a genuine crisis of capitalism of the sort that Marx talked about. The Marxist interpretation of the crisis goes as follows. By the 1970s, the post-war mixed economy model of capitalism had run out of steam. The long boom led to a lower rate of profit for capital as full employment meant workers received a bigger slice of the cake. Unemployment coupled with the free-market reforms of the late 1970s and 1980s broke the power of industrial labour and shifted the focus of western economies from manufacturing to finance. Financial capitalism delivered higher profits, but only by suppressing wages. But since market economies can only function if there is sufficient demand for goods and services, a way had to be found to boost consumption. That was achieved through higher levels of personal debt, cheerfully provided by the newly liberalised financial services sector. Growth rates were kept artificially high, and the tax revenues thereby generated allowed governments to spend more than they could actually afford. To complete the picture, the debt was shifted across national borders by globalisation, so China would lend America the money to buy the cheap industrial products being made in the factories of east Asia, and Germany would do the same for the less competitive members of the eurozone, such as Greece and Spain. There has been what another 19th-century thinker, Charles Darwin, identified as a process of natural selection. The stronger nations, which have retained a better balance between spending and consumption, and have nurtured their productive sectors, appear better able to survive than those nations which persistently lived beyond their means and used excessive debt to borrow growth from the future. Germany fits into the first category, while Britain is a classic example of the second. Even now, there is a fond belief in the UK that a period of rapid, sustained growth is just around the corner. But all the traditional sources of expansion \u2013 a housing boom that allows equity withdrawal; banking and finance; and a bigger state \u2013 have been closed off. Rebalancing the economy towards manufacturing would be a good idea if there was a big enough industrial base to tack up the slack from the rest of the economy. But there isn't. In the developing world it has been a different story, as lower wages have kept profits high. If the Marxist interpretation is right, this will be a temporary respite, because if the emerging nations continue to develop at their current rate it won't be too long before they face similar tensions to those that have faced the west. All this represents a formidable challenge, as it did in the 1930s. Then, there was a three-stage process of recovery: first an aggressive easing of macro-economic policy; second an era of what might be called military Keynesianism as defence spending was boosted in preparation for war; and finally a series of institutional arrangements including stronger trade unions, capital controls and expanded welfare states designed to spread the fruits of growth. The demand generated by post-war reconstruction was also crucial. Of this model, only the first element \u2013 bold macro-economic policy \u2013 is in place today. Britain and the United States have relied on unconventional monetary policy to boost growth, but this has not been enough to deliver sustained recovery. Trade unions are much weakened, the wage share in national income has been squeezed, and real income growth has been weak. Unlike in the period after 1945, governments are retrenching rather than expanding. The hope is that private investment will ride to the rescue. Cash-rich companies will create the new products for the digital age in the way that they did for the consumer age in the quarter of a century after the second world war. Optimists would say there is a new technological paradigm out there just waiting to be exploited. Well, perhaps, but for now it doesn't feel that way. The message to voters in the west is that this is a tough, even brutal environment, where only the lean and mean organisations will survive. We can no longer expect to borrow our way to prosperity, either privately or publicly and we are not as rich as we thought we were. Low growth, bankrupt states, precarious banks and falling living standards: that's now the new normal.",
