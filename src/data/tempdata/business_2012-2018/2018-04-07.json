      "bodyText": "Employee ownership, better known as the John Lewis model, remains a niche approach to business in the UK. But it is growing, and one West Country agricultural entrepreneur is the latest backer of an idea that has been embraced by more than 300 British companies. Guy Singh-Watson is handing more than three-quarters of his Riverford Organic Farmers business to its 650 employees as part of plans to create a structure where the staff will have a say in the firm\u2019s future. Singh-Watson started Riverford, an organic vegetable box service, by growing produce in a Devonshire field he rented from his brother. He now presides over a business that has a \u00a360m turnover and distributes nearly 50,000 boxes of produce a week, and says he wants to protect the Riverford brand from venture capitalist investors who do not understand the business. \u201cI\u2019m on a mission to show that a better way of doing business is commercially possible \u2013 and desirable,\u201d says Singh-Watson, tall and dapper in his boho farmer kit of colourful jumbo cord and cashmere, as he strides around a broccoli field that is still recovering from last month\u2019s snow and ice. \u201cI don\u2019t think you get most of what staff can offer by motivating them just with money. All the research tells us that\u2019s rubbish. With a lot of planning and work, we can achieve a lot more.\u201d Staff will not have to buy shares under the employee ownership plan; their 76% stake will be held in a trust overseen by a board that will be involved in running Riverford alongside a staff council. Workers will share about 10% of annual profits, as they have since the 1990s, and a loan from ethical bank Triodos will let the business pay \u00a36m over four years to Singh-Watson, who turns 58 this month. The business is worth more than \u00a320m, and Singh-Watson, who added the Singh to his name in 2014 after his second marriage, could have walked away with a much bigger pile if he had entertained an offer from one of the many City types seeking a slice of the fast-growing food delivery market. Such investors are helping fuel the rise of schemes such as Farmdrop and Hello Fresh, which have moved into a field Riverford has ploughed for more than 20 years. Singh-Watson set the company up in 1986 as experiment in growing organic vegetables on the family farm. He sold to supermarkets at first, then in 1993 started using an old Citro\u00ebn to deliver the produce to about 30 friends. Today, the business has moved from the original family site to five farms \u2013 in Devon, Cambridgeshire, Hampshire, North Yorkshire and France. It delivers about 50,000 veg boxes a week, supplied by its own farms and a network of about 40 others. It also has a fledgling recipe box service \u2013 with ingredients delivered ready to prepare a meal \u2013 a restaurant at its headquarters in Buckfastleigh, Devon, and a gastropub in London. Riverford posted a 9% rise in sales to \u00a356.7m for the year to May 2017, but profits fell by nearly 17% to \u00a3590,000 as the company invested in a more sophisticated packing system. Singh-Watson first thought about handing ownership to staff more than a decade ago, but sales of organic vegetables were hit after the financial crash, just as the company was beset by problems with its website. The plan was put on hold as Riverford got to grips with being \u201can internet retailer, not a bunch of straw-chewing farmers\u201d. But Singh-Watson says he has had no problem resisting the lure of a big cheque. \u201cWhat would I do with it? Would it make me happier? I\u2019m pretty confident it wouldn\u2019t, and it would leave the company with a lot of debt.\u201d He plans to invest his payout from the deal in a compost-making business and to pay off the mortgage on a new farm where he wants to experiment with permaculture and forest-garden agriculture. Singh-Watson has long made it clear that he will not be handing over the cash as an inheritance \u2013 he has four children from his first marriage and a stepchild from his second \u2013 a decision with which he insists they seem \u201cpretty happy\u201d. He is keen to preserve the legacy of a business that puts fair treatment of staff and suppliers at its heart. Unlike many supermarkets, Riverford cuts long-term deals with farmers and works with them to get as much of the crop as possible on to punters\u2019 plates. \u201cThis is my mausoleum, my folly on the hill. It\u2019s what I was put on the planet for,\u201d Singh-Watson says. Similar motivations have driven more than 300 British firms to move to employee ownership, from Arup architects to John Lewis, with recent converts including the Sawday\u2019s holiday guides group and ethical beauty brand Lush. The Employee Ownership Association says its membership is growing by 10% a year as business founders, particularly in companies with an ethical or community focus, look for a way to preserve their legacy. \u201cGrowth is driven by businesses which have a definite set of values not wanting to sell to the highest bidder and walk away,\u201d says Deb Oxley, the association\u2019s chief executive. She says the process also allows business owners to make a more gradual exit than financial or trade buyers might allow. A long list, pinned up on the canteen wall at Riverford, of the things Singh-Watson is responsible for makes it clear that will remain very much involved. After years of gutsy self-determination and experimental business ideas, it could be tricky for the keen surfer and sailor to let go of the tiller. But Singh-Watson insists he is stepping back. Does he worry, though, that he is cashing out and handing more responsibility to the staff just at the point where Riverford is facing the challenges of Brexit and a raft of well-financed competitors? Singh-Watson admits it is \u201cquite irritating that a lot of people are stealing our clothes and being propped up by City money\u201d. But he adds that many of these businesses are chasing growth to satisfy the financiers while finding it hard to make money. And that is the trap he wants Riverford to avoid.",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s richest 1% are on course to control as much as two-thirds of the world\u2019s wealth by 2030, according to a shocking analysis that has lead to a cross-party call for action. World leaders are being warned that the continued accumulation of wealth at the top will fuel growing distrust and anger over the coming decade unless action is taken to restore the balance. An alarming projection produced by the House of Commons library suggests that if trends seen since the 2008 financial crash were to continue, then the top 1% will hold 64% of the world\u2019s wealth by 2030. Even taking the financial crash into account, and measuring their assets over a longer period, they would still hold more than half of all wealth. Since 2008, the wealth of the richest 1% has been growing at an average of 6% a year \u2013 much faster than the 3% growth in wealth of the remaining 99% of the world\u2019s population. Should that continue, the top 1% would hold wealth equating to $305tn (\u00a3216.5tn) \u2013 up from $140tn today. Analysts suggest wealth has become concentrated at the top because of recent income inequality, higher rates of saving among the wealthy, and the accumulation of assets. The wealthy also invested a large amount of equity in businesses, stocks and other financial assets, which have handed them disproportionate benefits. New polling by Opinium suggests that voters perceive a major problem with the influence exerted by the very wealthy. Asked to select a group that would have the most power in 2030, most (34%) said the super-rich, while 28% opted for national governments. In a sign of falling levels of trust, those surveyed said they feared the consequences of wealth inequality would be rising levels of corruption (41%) or the \u201csuper-rich enjoying unfair influence on government policy\u201d (43%). The research was commissioned by Liam Byrne, the former Labour cabinet minister, as part of a gathering of MPs, academics, business leaders, trade unions and civil society leaders focused on addressing the problem. The actor Michael Sheen, who has opted to scale back his Hollywood career to campaign against high-interest credit providers, was among those supporting the calls. The hope is to create pressure for global action when leaders of the G20 group of nations gather for a summit in Buenos Aires in November. Byrne, who organised the first OECD global parliamentary conference on inclusive growth, said he believed global inequality was \u201cnow at a tipping point\u201d. \u201cIf we don\u2019t take steps to rewrite the rules of how our economies work, then we condemn ourselves to a future that remains unequal for good,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s morally bad, and economically disastrous, risking a new explosion in instability, corruption and poverty.\u201d In a sign of the concern about the accumulation of wealth in the hands of so few, the move has gained support from across the political divide. George Freeman, the Tory MP and former head of the prime minister\u2019s policy board, said: \u201cWhile mankind has never seen such income inequality, it is also true that mankind has never experienced such rapid increases in living standards. Around the world billions of people are being lifted out of poverty at a pace never seen before. But the extraordinary concentration of global wealth today \u2013 fuelled by the pace of technological innovation and globalisation \u2013 poses serious challenges. \u201cIf the system of capitalist liberal democracy which has triumphed in the west is to pass the big test of globalisation \u2013 and the assault from radical Islam as well as its own internal pressures from post-crash austerity \u2013 we need some new thinking on ways to widen opportunity, share ownership and philanthropy. Fast.\u201d Demands for action from the group include improving productivity to ensure wages rise and reform of capital markets to promote greater equality. Danny Dorling, professor of geography at the University of Oxford, said the scenario in which the super-rich accumulated even more wealth by 2030 was a realistic one. \u201cEven if the income of the wealthiest people in the world stops rising dramatically in the future, their wealth will still grow for some time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last peak of income inequality was in 1913. We are near that again, but even if we reduce inequality now it will continue to grow for one to two more decades.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "About 2,000 jobs are set to be saved with the buyout of retail chains Wine Rack and Bargain Booze in a \u00a37m deal. The retail division of troubled drinks group Conviviality has been acquired by grocery wholesaler Bestway in a pre-pack administration process, which allows the buyer to cherry pick a collapsed company\u2019s best assets at a bargain price. The deal was completed just before midnight on Friday. Matthew Callaghan, partner at PwC, said: \u201cThis deal safeguards the jobs of more than 2,000 employees, ensures franchisees have the ability to continue to trade and creates some much-needed stability for business customers and the sector in general. \u201cAlongside the sale of Conviviality\u2019s Direct business earlier this week, the total number of staff whose jobs have been protected stands at more than 4,000.\u201d Bestway, which was founded and is chaired by the billionaire Sir Anwar Pervez, is one of Britain\u2019s biggest food wholesalers serving thousands of retailers; it also owns the Well pharmacy chain, which it bought from the Co-op in 2014. Conviviality announced its intention to appoint administrators last week after a string of profit warnings and the discovery of a \u00a330m tax bill, putting more than 2,600 jobs at risk. On Wednesday, Magners owner C&amp;C bought Conviviality\u2019s wholesale arm through a pre-pack administration. The Irish cider giant bought wholesalers Matthew Clark, Bibendum, Catalyst, Peppermint, Elastic and Walker &amp; Wodehouse for a nominal sum. Stella Artois and Budweiser maker AB InBev is also supporting the deal. PwC handled the sale and administration process. Conviviality\u2019s retail arm operates more than 800 stores under brands including chains Select Convenience, Central Convenience and Wine Rack as well as Bargain Booze, many of which are run by independent franchisees. The breakup of Conviviality marks the end of the firm after rapid demise over just a few weeks. The chief executive, Diana Hunter, stepped down last month after shares in the company were suspended at 101p in the wake of two profit warnings in the space of a week that wiped more than 60% off its stock market value. The company blamed the first shock profit warning on a spreadsheet arithmetic error made by a member of its finance team and weakening profit margins and then admitted it had not budgeted for the \u00a330m tax bill due at the end of March. Conviviality issued a third profit warning as it admitted it needed to ask investors for new funding of \u00a3125m to avoid going bust, but failed to convince them of its long-term future. Former investors in Conviviality are considering a lawsuit after raising questions over the company\u2019s strategy in making a string of rapid acquisitions, including the recent purchase of more than 100 Central Convenience stores from the collapsed Palmer &amp; Harvey business. Meanwhile, the chair of parliament\u2019s work and pensions committee, Frank Field, has questioned the role of the auditor KPMG.",

      "bodyText": "Spiralling rents are driving growing numbers of artists and small businesses out of London\u2019s East End, with the problem expected to spread to other cities around the UK. Faced with rent increases of 200% to 300%, small businesses that have been based in the capital for decades are being forced to relocate to Kent or Essex, according to the New Economics Foundation thinktank and the East End Trades Guild (EETG) founded in 2012 representing 230 small firms with a combined turnover of more than \u00a380m. In many cases, traders are being replaced by cafes and workspaces designed for people working on laptops. Of those that remain, many are struggling for survival, as business rates also went up substantially last year for the first time in seven years. Frances Northrop of the New Economics Foundation says: \u201cImagine London without the small businesses of Portobello Road, Brick Lane, Columbia Road and Chinatown. They are being driven out by the cold logic of ever-increasing rents.\u201d Many small independent businesses are based in railway arches across London, often owned by Network Rail or Transport for London. Network Rail has almost 4,500 arches across the country, with two-thirds of those in London. Transport for London, meanwhile, owns about 2,000 commercial units across London. Derec Hickman of Chu\u2019s Garage in Hackney, who runs the Guardians of the Arches, a group that is open to traders in the rest of the UK, says: \u201cThe action is spreading from London to other cities. What\u2019s happening to us will happen to them.\u201d Five of his neighbours are looking to leave, and one trader has already moved out of the arches due to the crippling rent increases. The EETG is proposing a London working rent: an affordable formula for small and micro-businesses akin to the London living rent, and has received backing from the mayors of Hackney and Tower Hamlets. The New Economics Foundation is in the process of working out a formula. Guardian Money spoke to a number of small businesses affected by the rent hikes. Poetstyle The bespoke furniture maker was one of the first tenants at Bayford Street Industrial Units in Hackney, built by the Greater London Council in the 1980s to attract local business and jobs to a then-run down area. This year, unable to meet the now private landlord\u2019s demands to double the rent, Poetstyle, with its 15 furniture makers, moved to Hainault, on the border of London and Essex. Managing director Charlie Fox says it has just moved out of its second workshop in a railway arch in Hackney after facing a similar rent hike there. He says Network Rail originally asked for \u00a331 per sq ft, which was then reduced to \u00a318 until September, but going up to \u00a324 thereafter. He was originally paying \u00a314. \u201cIt\u2019s not really viable,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is tough, ever since Brexit, but I just can\u2019t hike the price of a sofa because I\u2019m up against cheap imports.\u201d Urban Species Sarah Haque and her son launched their company in 2004 in Cheshire Street, Shoreditch, to create and sell T-shirts and other products designed by London and UK-based artists. Their business rate has gone up from \u00a31,100 to \u00a316,000 a year, while the annual rent charged by their private landlord is rising to \u00a329,000 plus VAT in a stepped five-year increase, compared with \u00a38,500 in 2006. No improvements have been made to the space, she says. Haque says she had to reduce her staff from 10 to four. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very sad because we\u2019ve been here more than 10 years and it\u2019ll be sad to leave. We can\u2019t increase our business, we are late in paying the rent and late in paying salaries. It\u2019s just a mess.\u201d Tatty Devine Best known for its laser-cut Perspex jewellery, Tatty Devine is run by Rosie Wolfenden and Harriet Vine, who founded the business together in 1999, and were awarded MBEs for services to the fashion industry in 2013. They opened a shop in London\u2019s Brick Lane in 2000 \u2013 but Wolfenden says the shop rent has quadrupled since then. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to the point where it\u2019s unaffordable,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s driving out so many creatives from Hackney or Tower Hamlets. A lot have gone to Kent, to Margate.\u201d She notes that there are lot of empty shops in east London. Wolfenden adds: \u201cIf we were to inflate our prices to match the rent and rate rises, we would go out of business.\u201d She says the business is surviving because it includes retail, wholesale and e-commerce, and could not have been set up in the same location if she and Vine were starting it today. Chu\u2019s Garage The MOT garage in a railway arch in London Fields, east London, was founded by Quang Chu 30 years ago. He is battling a rent increase from Network Rail, his landlord, which originally wanted to hike the rent from \u00a318,000 to \u00a338,000 (or \u00a335,000 if the garage gave up its secured tenancy). Network Rail is now asking for a stepped increase to \u00a326,500 in the first year, going up to \u00a334,000 in the third year, says the firm. Ten other traders in the arches were put under the same pressure, says Derec Hickman, who married into the Vietnamese family that founded Chu\u2019s Garage. The garage and one other trader are due to go to arbitration, where the rent will be set by independent assessors. What the owners say Network Rail On the claim that it is hiking rents in order to pocket a bigger profit from the sale of property, it says \u201cthis is completely untrue. Any reviews are part of business-as-usual activity. The sale will be based on past performance and receipts of the estate over a number of years\u201d. Asked about increases of 200% to 300% or more, it says \u201cthis is not typical at all \u2026 average increases reflect the numbers of years since the last review, up to six, and the average market rents in the area, which we use for comparison as we aim to be competitive\u201d. Rents, it says, are very competitive, adding: \u201cWe support thousands of independent businesses across the country \u2026 where significant increases are proposed, we look to mitigate the impact by negotiating with tenants and, where appropriate, offering stepped increases \u2026 we are a taxpayer-funded public company, with a responsibility to use funds from rents and sales to invest in growing the railway. Rents are at the low end to ensure they are competitive.\u201d Transport for London Graeme Craig, director of commercial development, says: \u201cWe are committed to encouraging diverse, small businesses as vital to London\u2019s economy. Our leases are flexible \u2026 and we are working with Tower Hamlets and Hackney and the EETG to explore how we might change our policies to allow smaller businesses to continue to flourish on our estate.\u201d",
