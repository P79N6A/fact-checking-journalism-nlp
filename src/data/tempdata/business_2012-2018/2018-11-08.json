      "bodyText": "Theresa May is pressing ahead with plans to boost the rights of workers in the gig economy on areas including flexibility and pay as part of a package of measures to overhaul employment laws, the Guardian has learned. The prime minister plans to end a legal loophole that allows companies to pay agency workers less than full-time staff for doing the same job as she attempts to demonstrate that she understands concerns about inequalities in the world of work. Ministers are proposing repealing the so-called Swedish derogation rule even though the Treasury would be cautious about upsetting business, which reacted with alarm when it was first floated, when they are already facing Brexit uncertainty. Business secretary Greg Clark has told cabinet colleagues that he hopes to implement several key recommendations from a review by Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the RSA and a former senior policy advisor to Tony Blair, that was commissioned by the government last year. It comes after Labour promised a radical extension of workers\u2019 rights, including greater representation on company boards and employees being handed a financial stake in firms, at its party conference in September. The government\u2019s proposals include: New legislation to give workers in the gig economy the right to request a temporary or fixed-hours contract after 12 months and to tackle the challenges in building up continuous service. Following the advice of the low-pay commission, which has already been consulted, on how to address what Taylor described as \u201cone-sided flexibility\u201d. The body is understood to be looking at notice periods and compensation for cancelled shifts. Legislating to clarify the criteria that determines whether people are workers or self-employed by bringing tax and employment laws into alignment. This could mean that more people currently defined as self-employed by firms such as Uber or Deliveroo would be entitled to worker protection. Naming and shaming employers that fail to pay out after employment tribunals as a deterrent to those that are considering flouting the law. More than a third of successful claimants never receive any of their compensation, and less than half are paid in full, according to government data. Changing the law so that the state can force companies to give paid holiday to vulnerable workers. If they fail to do so, they would face tough financial penalties along the lines of those which already exists for underpayment of the minimum wage. Ministers also plan to explore new powers, proposed by a separate review, to impose fines on companies that break the rules on agency worker regulations by failing to give staff holiday or sick pay, and demanding a payslip for all workers. They want to launch a pilot scheme to investigate the level of labour exploitation at hand car washes, which are regularly linked by the police with illegal labour and modern day slavery. They are considering setting up a single labour market enforcement agency, which would bring together the relevant parts of HMRC, the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority and the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate. However, there is a row brewing over this proposal with Clark telling colleagues it could help ease pressure on HMRC and other agencies given the expanded role of state enforcement, while home secretary Sajid Javid is understood to have some concerns over its potential effectiveness. Taylor\u2019s review of modern working practices came up with 53 recommendations. His proposal to reduce the difference between the national insurance contributions of employees and the self-employed was rejected by government after a backlash from Tory MPs. At the launch of the report in July 2017, May said her government would act to shore up the interests of those working in new insecure roles alongside traditional employees and the self-employed. \u201cAt its best, a job can be a genuine vocation, providing the means to intellectual and personal fulfilment, as well as economic security,\u201d she said, while pledging that any action would avoid \u201coverbearing legislation\u201d. Business groups such as the CBI broadly welcomed the review, though there was a more mixed response from the unions. Unite said it had \u201cspectacularly failed to deliver\u201d on tackling insecure work while the GMB described it as a \u201cdisappointing missed opportunity\u201d. May used the publication of the Taylor review to relaunch her premiership after her disastrous election showing, insisting that her \u201cdefining beliefs\u201d remained despite the Tories losing their majority. Responding to the review in February, Clark promised to improve working conditions, but it has taken him until now to set out his proposals to cabinet colleagues. Welcoming the government\u2019s response earlier this year, Taylor said: \u201cIt will make a difference to the lives of the most vulnerable workers and that is what matters ... but there is more work to be done to encourage the government to be bold in living up to its commitment to good work for all.\u201d There are an estimated 1.1 million people working in Britain\u2019s gig economy, according to the RSA, with 28% in accountancy, legal work or other consultancy, 18% in plumbing, building and other skilled manual work, 17% in cleaning and other household services and 9% in delivery and courier services.",

      "bodyText": "The merger of two of the UK\u2019s biggest energy firms is hanging in the balance after npower and SSE said they would have to reconsider the terms of the deal because of the government\u2019s price cap and tough market conditions. Late on Thursday the companies admitted the merger was unlikely to complete at the start of 2019 as planned, due to the new considerations. Innogy SE, the German owner of npower, said the parent companies may have to inject more cash into the planned new merged energy giant, which would be almost as big as market leader British Gas if it goes ahead. UK-listed SSE blamed the impact of the government\u2019s price cap on default tariffs and the challenge of securing an \u201cappropriate credit rating\u201d for the new energy supplier. The UK\u2019s competition watchdog cleared the creation of a new energy giant in August, but it now appears the business rationale for the merger may be its biggest threat. The Guardian understands the deal is in serious trouble but could still be salvaged if new terms can be agreed. SSE cited recent market developments, including: \u201cThe potential impact of the level of the default tariff cap on \u2026 the new company\u2019s requirements to post collateral against its credit exposure and its ability to obtain and retain an appropriate credit rating.\u201d This week Ofgem set the final level of the price cap at \u00a31,137 for a household with typical consumption, which the energy regulator expects to knock 5% off the profits of large suppliers. Innogy SE said the price cap would have a significant impact and cited adverse market conditions, but said both companies still saw the benefits of a merger. Martin Herrmann, of Innogy SE, said the new negotiations would include \u201cpotential additional direct or indirect financial contributions by each party\u201d. If the mega merger still goes ahead, it will amount to one of the biggest shake-ups of the UK energy market for years, reducing the big six to five and creating a firm with similar scale to British Gas for the first time. The companies appear to have given themselves a month to fix the crisis \u2013 SSE said it would provide an update on the merger in mid-December.",

    "webTitle": "Tesla: Robyn Denholm named as new chair to replace Elon Musk", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesla has appointed Robyn Denholm as chair of its board, replacing the electric carmaker\u2019s billionaire founder Elon Musk. The move, which was forced on the company by US financial regulators to settle fraud claims against Musk, ends speculation that James Murdoch, the 21st Century Fox boss and a Tesla director since July 2017, was set to take over. Denholm, one of two female directors on the nine-member board, assumes her new position immediately, Tesla said. It will become full-time once she leaves her role as chief financial officer and head of strategy at Telstra, Australia\u2019s largest telecom company, after her six-month notice period. The 55-year-old Australian will temporarily step down as chair of Tesla\u2019s audit committee until she quits Telstra, where she only took over as CFO last month, having been chief operations officer since early 2017. In late September, Musk, who remains chief executive and is also Tesla\u2019s biggest investor, agreed to step down as chair for three years and pay a fine in a deal with the US Securities and Exchange Commission over tweets he made about taking the firm into private ownership. The financial regulator accused Musk of fraud and misleading investors, and fined him and the company $20m (\u00a315.3m) each. His erratic behaviour on Twitter has continued with an announcement last month that he had deleted his titles to be the \u201cNothing of Tesla\u201d, later saying he would remain president \u201cor it will confuse the authorities\u201d. A spokeswoman confirmed he remained CEO but the titles were removed as part of an update to Tesla\u2019s website. Musk remains embroiled in other scandals. He is being sued by a British diver he called a \u201cpedo\u201d after the two had a row over how to save a group of children stuck in a Thai cave. Musk also courted controversy when he smoked cannabis while live on a radio show. Despite the distractions, Tesla made a profit of $312m in the third quarter, well ahead of Wall Street forecasts, with revenues of $6.8bn. The mid-priced Tesla Model 3 was the fifth bestselling passenger car in America, according to industry analyst Edmunds. Denholm has been on the Tesla board as an independent director since 2014 and has had senior roles at other Silicon Valley tech companies including Juniper Networks, where she was chief financial officer, and Sun Microsystems. She had moved to the US in 2001 after spending her early career at Arthur Anderson in Sydney and Japanese carmaker Toyota, before returning to Australia for the senior Telstra roles. Musk said: \u201cRobyn has extensive experience in both the tech and auto industries, and she has made significant contributions as a Tesla board member over the past four years in helping us become a profitable company. I look forward to working even more closely with Robyn as we continue accelerating the advent of sustainable energy.\u201d Denholm said: \u201cI believe in this company, I believe in its mission and I look forward to helping Elon and the Tesla team achieve sustainable profitability and drive long-term shareholder value.\u201d",

It will become full-time once she leaves her role as chief financial officer and head of strategy at Telstra, Australia\u2019s largest telecom company, after her six-month notice period.</p> <p>The 55-year-old Australian will temporarily step down as chair of Tesla\u2019s audit committee until she quits Telstra, where she only took over as CFO last month, having been chief operations officer since early 2017.</p> <p>In late September, Musk, who remains chief executive and is also Tesla\u2019s biggest investor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/29/elon-musk-tesla-40m-sec-case-tweets\">agreed to step down as chair</a> for three years and pay a fine in a deal with the US Securities and Exchange Commission over tweets he made about taking the firm into private ownership. The financial regulator accused Musk of fraud and misleading investors, and fined him and the company $20m (\u00a315.3m) each.</p> <p>His erratic behaviour on Twitter has continued with an announcement last month that he had deleted his titles to be the \u201cNothing of Tesla\u201d, later saying he would remain president \u201cor it will confuse the authorities\u201d. A spokeswoman confirmed he remained CEO but the titles were removed as part of an update to Tesla\u2019s website.</p> <p>Musk remains embroiled in other scandals.

The response is the second move in a fortnight by ministers following the publication of the investigation in October, with Theresa May pledging last month to give tenants access to the government\u2019s new rogue landlord database. The Guardian and ITV News had revealed that not a single name had been entered into the new system in more than six months since its launch \u2013 and that even when landlords\u2019 names were listed, the public would not be allowed to see them. In announcing the new money \u2013 which works out at less than \u00a36,000 per council \u2013 the housing minister Heather Wheeler said: \u201cThis funding will help further strengthen councils\u2019 powers to tackle rogue landlords and ensure that poor-quality homes in their area are improved, making the housing market fairer for everyone.\u201d The government said the funding would be used to support a range of projects that \u201ccouncils have said will help them to ramp up action against criminal landlords \u2013 for example, to build relationships with external organisations such as the emergency services, legal services and local housing advocates\u201d. Councils may also decide to use the funds to support tenants to take action against poor standards through rent repayment orders. Jacky Peacock, a director of the tenants charity Advice4Renters, said: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging that the government recognises the need for local authorities to step up action, although \u00a32m will not go far, given the scale of the problem and the challenges in making a real impact while also protecting the tenants in the properties.\u201d She said she hoped the government would make further funds available when changes to the law come into effect next year. The expected new regulations include preventing landlords of properties with the poorest energy efficiency ratings from offering new tenancies, and fresh powers for tenants to take legal action against their landlords rather than relying on local authority enforcement. The government said there were more than 4.5m households in the private rented sector in England, and that \u201crecent statistics show that 82% of private renters are satisfied with their accommodation\u201d. It estimates there are 10,500 rogue landlords operating in England.",

      "bodyText": "British fashion house Burberry has hailed an \u201cexceptional\u201d response to the designs introduced by new creative boss Riccardo Tisci, in spite of falling revenues in the first half of its financial year. Revenues fell by 3% to \u00a31.22bn for the 26 weeks ending on 29 September compared with the same period last year, the company said. The London-headquartered company reported significantly higher profits for the half year, although these were boosted by foreign exchange effects thanks to its global sales footprint. Its adjusted measure of profits, which aims to show the underlying performance of the business, fell by 4% to \u00a3180m. Marco Gobbetti, Burberry\u2019s chief executive, gave an upbeat message to investors, hailing the efforts of new designer Tisci as well as the firm\u2019s performance on Instagram and on WeChat, one of the leading social media platforms in the key Chinese market. Gobbetti said: \u201cWe are energised by the early results as we begin to transform and reposition Burberry. The initial response from influencers, press, buyers and customers to our new creative vision and Riccardo\u2019s debut collection Kingdom has been exceptional.\u201d However, he added that the company is \u201conly in the first phase of our multi-year plan\u201d as it tries to reposition its brand. Burberry is trying to regain momentum after the departure last year of Christopher Bailey, the former chief executive and creative director who was credited with transforming the venerable fashion house into a global brand. Tisci unveiled the first new Burberry logo for 20 years in August as he tried to make his mark on the brand ahead of his debut collection at London fashion week. The collection enjoyed a positive response from wholesale fashion buyers, and garnered the second-most views of shows featured on theVogue website, Burberry said. As part of the revamp Burberry in September ended the practice of burning clothes it could not sell at full price. In 2017 it destroyed \u00a328.6m worth of unsold products to prevent the clothes from being sold at cheaper prices. The latest collection also did not contain any real fur, after criticisms from animal rights campaigners. Burberry shares closed up 2.7% at \u00a318.65.",

      "bodyText": "The UK will sink to the bottom of the European economic growth league next year to join Italy as the slowest-growing economy in the EU, before falling further the year after to anchor the table alone, according to European commission forecasts. The EU\u2019s gloomy predictions are based on a soft Brexit \u2013 meaning Britain is expected to lag behind all its EU peers even if Theresa May can reach a deal with Brussels before 29 March. The commission forecast that consumer spending growth will remain weak, continuing a subpar performance since the EU referendum in June 2016. It said business investment would remain subdued, while external demand for UK goods will dwindle. The commission predicted the result would be GDP growth of 1.2% in 2019 and 2020. The euro area of 19 countries including Germany, France and Italy is forecast to slow from a growth rate of 2.1% this year to 1.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020, as the wider region enters a period of weaker growth following the strongest year of the past decade in 2017. It comes as the wider global economy is unsettled by Donald Trump\u2019s trade disputes with China and Europe, which have reduced demand for manufactured goods and stifled business investment. Despite the weaker outlook for the UK economy, growth figures have shown Britain managing a better performance than the eurozone over recent quarters. Statistics due on Friday are expected to show UK economic growth of 0.6% for the third quarter. Economists at HSBC believe Germany is likely to record its first drop in quarterly economic output, of 0.1%, for more than three years. The wide range of potential outcomes from the Brexit talks will also have a significant bearing on the future path of the economy. Assuming a deal is secured, analysts at the consultancy Capital Economics believe growth could accelerate to 2.2% next year and remain around 2% in 2020. The commission forecasts came as the International Monetary Fund also sounded the alarm over the mounting risks from no-deal Brexit, while warning about the threat from trade disputes around the world and high levels of Italian government debt. In the IMF\u2019s latest health check on the region, it warned the European economy would probably run into turbulence in the next few years. The Washington-based fund said all likely Brexit outcomes would have a negative cost for the economy, although it warned a no-deal scenario would have the biggest downsides. \u201cNo-deal Brexit would lead to high trade and non-trade barriers between the UK and the rest of the EU, with negative consequences for growth,\u201d it said. The IMF also warned the populist Italian government to tackle its high levels of government borrowing before time runs out. In a rebuke to the Italian government, which is currently locked in a bitter standoff with the commission over its budget plans for next year, the IMF regional director for Europe, Poul Thomsen, said Italy needed to urgently rebuild strength in its public finances. \u201cWe basically agree with the commission\u2019s assessment [on Italy\u2019s budget],\u201d he said. The commission has demanded Italy resubmit its tax and spending plans ahead of a deadline next week, because it argues the proposals break commission rules over government borrowing. The Italian government has so far however refused to change course, insisting it will not \u201ckneel\u201d before the EU. Although Italy\u2019s tax and spending plans may help stimulate its economy, Thomsen said they could have the opposite effect, given that Italy has the second-highest national debt in Europe, after Greece, of more than 130% of GDP. \u201c[Growth is] not going to come from fiscal stimulus,\u201d Thomsen said. \u201cItaly does not have space for [raising spending]. You could see a situation where expansion of fiscal policy had a negative impact on growth \u2026 the cost to Italian borrowing will go up and you actually end up slowing the economy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s my colleague Richard Partington on today\u2019s EC growth figures: The UK will sink to the bottom of the European economic growth league next year to join Italy as the slowest-growing economy in the EU, before falling further the year after to anchor the table alone, according to European commission forecasts. The EU\u2019s gloomy predictions are based on a soft Brexit \u2013 meaning Britain is expected to lag behind all its EU peers even if Theresa May can reach a deal with Brussels before 29 March. The commission forecasts that consumer spending growth will remain weak, continuing a subpar performance since the EU referendum in June 2016. It said business investment would stay subdued, while external demand for UK goods will dwindle. The commission predicted the result would be GDP growth of 1.2% in 2019 and 2020. That\u2019s probably all for today.... The latest US jobs data shows its labor market remains historically strong. Just 214,000 people filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week, not far from the lowest level ever. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped by 8,000 to just 1.62 million, the lowest level since July 28, 1973. With such strong data, the Republicans might have been expected to put up a stronger fight in defending the House of Representatives.... Economists at HSBC have bad news for Germany: they believe its economy probably shrank over the summer. The first estimate of German GDP in the third-quarter of 208 is released next Wednesday. HSBC believes it will show the economy contracted by 0.1%, down from a previous forecast of +0.4%. In a new report, they say: After thirteen consecutive quarters with positive quarterly growth rates, the German economy seems likely to have taken a breather in Q3 2018. That\u2019s partly due to the slump in exports in September, in the face of trade conflicts (as covered earlier this morning). HSBC explain how this could mean net trade dragged on growth: The headwinds from the slowdown in world trade might also have been weighing on German export activity, which could have affected GDP negatively on the expenditure side. At the same time, import growth remains quite strong, resulting in the trade surplus hitting its lowest level since March 2014 in July. New European car emission tests have also hurt vehicle production in recent months, a key area of the German economy. Set your alarm clocks for 7am GMT next Wednesday, when the German growth figures are released. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has just weighed in on the EU-Italy budget row, backing Brussels. In a new report, the IMF predicts that Italy\u2019s growth will sink to just 0.9% in 2020 (worst than the UK). It also says Rome should focus on cutting its debts, rather than borrowing more to spur growth.... It\u2019s worth noting that the UK\u2019s independent Office for Budget Responsibility is less gloomy about growth prospects. Last week the OBR forecast UK growth of 1.3% in 2018 (matching the EC\u2019s view). The fiscal watchdog then spies growth accelerating to 1.6% in 2019, dipping to 1.4% in 2020. That\u2019s significantly better than the EC\u2019s prediction of just 1.2% growth each year. And the OBR has an advantage: It knew about Philip Hammond\u2019s \u2018giveaway budget\u2019 when it produced its number. The EC\u2019s forecasts were inked in on 22 October, a week before the budget. So Britain might not be in as much peril as the EC believes. Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway has tweeted this point too: Today\u2019s growth forecasts have also escalated the row between Brussels and Rome over Italy\u2019s budget. The Commission\u2019s forecast that Italy will grow by only 1.2% in 2019 is below the 1.5% predicted by its new government. That means the EC believes Italy\u2019s budget deficit will hit 2.9%, not the 2.4% predicted by Rome (which Brussels has already rejected). Brussels insists that Italy submits a new budget by next Tuesday, which would mean dropping some of the spending plans which its coalition government promised in this year\u2019s election. EU commissioner Moscovici has told reporters in Brussels that: \u201cThere cannot be a sort of negotiation on this.\u201d But Italy\u2019s administration hasn\u2019t shown signs of backing down, arguing that the economy needs stimulating, and that a fiscal boost will pay for itself in higher growth. You can read the EC\u2019s new Autumn economic forecasts online here. The UK section starts on page 140 (p152 of the pdf). The EC is keen to point out that its forecasts are based on the \u201cpurely technical assumption\u201d that the EU and UK maintain their current trading relationship after Brexit. In other words, Britain is expected to lag behind Europe in the event of a soft Brexit, rather than a hard Brexit that causes significant disrupion to trade. On that basis, the EU predicts that: Consumer spending growth will be weak in 2019, as real wage growth will be modest. Business investment growth will rebound in 2019, but remain \u201crelatively subdued following a prolonged period of heightened uncertainty.\u201d Net trade\u2019s contribution to growth will continue to dwindle, \u201calongside slowing external demand\u201d. That adds up to growth of just 1.2% in both 2019 and 2020. But the EC also warns there are large, downside risks to these forecasts - if Brexit is less benign, growth will be slower, it fears. In ANOTHER gloomy warning, credit rating agency Moody\u2019s has predicted that global economic growth was likely to slow in the next two years. Reuters has the details: \u201cWe expect global growth to slow to under 3.0% in 2019 and 2020, from an estimated 3.3% in 2017-18\u201d, the agency said in a new report. Moody\u2019s also fears that the US-China trade war will intensify in 2019, hurting the wider global economy. It wasy: \u201cIn both countries, the overall direct macro impact on growth will be manageable. However, persistent and broadening tensions between the two largest economies globally are increasingly likely to have widespread negative implications by undermining investment.\u201d The UK is expected to be the third slowest-growing EU member this year (at +1.3%), behind Italy (+1.1%) and Denmark (1.2%). Today\u2019s EC forecasts show the UK sinking to joint last place with Italy in 2019, at +1.2%. In 2020, the UK is expected to underperform every EU member with growth of 1.2%, while Italy creeps up to 1.3%. These forecasts are inevitably speculative, as the Commission simply doesn\u2019t know how Brexit will pan out. It also can\u2019t be sure what policies Italy\u2019s new populist government will follow. But it\u2019s not a great outlook for either country.... The European Commission\u2019s latest assessment of the UK economy isn\u2019t terribly encouraging, as Britain prepares to leave the EU next year. The EC expects growth to remain weak, and unemployment to rise: UK GDP growth is currently subdued and expected to remain so over the forecast horizon. Private consumption growth is forecast to remain weak as real wages grow modestly and households look to maintain savings. Heightened uncertainty means that business investment growth is likely to remain constrained. The net trade contribution to growth is projected to decrease in-line with a moderation in external demand. Employment growth is expected to slow significantly, leading to a modest rise in unemployment. Inflation should ease as the impact of sterling\u2019s 2016 depreciation unwinds. The Commission is optimistic that unemployment will keep falling over the next couple of years. The eurozone jobless rate is already at a 10-year low, dropping to 8.1% in September. The EC hopes it will fall to 7.5% in 2020 -- if so, it would still be much higher than in the UK (4%) and the US (3.7%). The EC predicts that Britain\u2019s economy faces a tough few years. UK growth is forecast at just 1.3% this year, and 1.2% in 2019 and 2020. That\u2019s the joint lowest for any (current) EU country next year, alongside Italy. Germany, in contrast, is expected to grow by 1.7% this year, 1.8% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2020. The UK growth forecasts are based on the assumption that Britain and the EU maintain the current \u201cstatus quo\u201d in their trading relationship after Brexit. That\u2019s not guaranteed, given the slow progress in agreeing a withdrawal agreement... Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue, says Europe needs to take precautions before the next down: \u201cAll EU economies are set to grow this year and next, which will bring more jobs. However, uncertainty and risks, both external and internal, are on the rise and start to take a toll on the pace of economic activity. We need to stay vigilant and work harder to reinforce the resilience of our economies. At EU level, it means taking concrete decisions on further strengthening our Economic and Monetary Union. At national level, there is even a stronger case for building up fiscal buffers and reducing debt while making sure that the benefits of growth are also felt by the most vulnerable members of society.\u201d The EC is hopeful that \u201cbarring major shocks\u201d Europe should be able to sustain above-potential economic growth, robust job creation and falling unemployment. However, this baseline scenario is subject to a growing number of interconnected downside risks, from a possible oil spike to the risk of an intensified trade war. Newsflash: Europe\u2019s economy will slow steadily over the next few years as trade wars, geopolitical tensions and higher oil price all bite. That\u2019s according to the latest projections from the European Commission, just released. They show that growth in the euro area is forecast to ease from a 10-year high of 2.4% in 2017 to 2.1% in 2018. It is then seen dropping to 1.9% in 2019, and 1.7% in 2020. The wider European Union is expected to growth by 2.2% this year, slowing to 2.0% in 2019 and 1.9% in 2020. The Commission blames three factors, saying Rising global uncertainty, international trade tensions and higher oil prices will have a dampening effect on growth in Europe. More to follow! Germany isn\u2019t the only European country hitting a soft patch. Spain\u2019s industrial output shrank by 0.1% in September, official data shows, the first drop since July 2016. Separately, French manufacturers have slashed their investment plans. They now expect to spend 1% less this year than in 2017, not 4% more. European stock markets have shrugged off Germany\u2019s export slowdown. The Stoxx 600 index has risen by 0.6%, as shares benefit from the prospect of the Democrats keeping Donald Trump in check. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says: There is very little going on, and yet there\u2019s a lot happening. US election uncertainty removed, equity markets hope they\u2019ve found the ideal combination of slightly less fiscal easing and slightly less monetary tightening that a more restrained president Trump will have to deliver. An outbreak of glee has hit markets.... But in the longer run, US political deadlock will lead to slower growth from mid-2019 onward, Juckes adds. German factory chiefs will be hoping for a breakthrough in the US-China trade dispute soon, before the slump in exports deepens. And overnight, a top Chinese diplomat has suggest that presidents Trump and Xi could make progress at the G20 world leaders\u2019 meeting in Argentina in three weeks time. Politburo member Yang Jiechi told U.S. national security adviser John Bolton that: \u201cChina is committed to working with the U.S. to achieve a no-confrontational, conflictless, mutually respectful co-operation in which both sides win. \u201cBoth sides should seek an appropriate solution through equal and mutually beneficial negotiations.\u201d Yang\u2019s comments were released by China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, suggesting Beijing is keen to get its message out. Carsten Brzeski of ING agrees that Germany exporters are suffering from slowing world trade. He also blames new car emissions tests; production has suffered as automakers scramble to meet these tough new rules. Brzeski fears next week\u2019s German GDP figures for July-September could be a stinker: Today\u2019s trade data ends a disappointing week for German industry. Available monthly data suggests that the economy had its worst quarterly performance in 3Q since the beginning of 2015. The first GDP estimate will be released next week on Wednesday. The 0.8% drop in German exports in September is the biggest since February. The FT reckons it \u201ccould be another sign that Europe\u2019s largest economy is feeling the effects of a slowdown in global trade\u201d. Monthly data can be volatile, but German exports have looked underwhelming for several months now: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Germany has suffered a drop in exports as the trade tensions swirling around the globe hit Europe\u2019s largest economy. German exports shrank by 0.8% in September, statistics body Destatis reported this morning, dashing expectations of a 0.3% rise. Imports declined by 0.4% (against expectations of a 0.8% rise). This shrank Germany\u2019s trade surplus to around \u20ac17.6bn, from \u20ac18.2bn in August, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Alarmingly, exports were actually lower than in September 2017, even though the world economy has expanded over the last year. Here\u2019s the details, from Destatis: Exports, September 2018 \u20ac109.1bn -0.8% on the previous month (calendar and seasonally adjusted) -1.2% on the same month a year earlier Imports, September 2018 \u20ac90.7bn -0.4% on the previous month (calendar and seasonally adjusted) +5.3% on the same month a year earlier It\u2019s the latest sign that Germany\u2019s economy has slowed sharply this year. Third-quarter GDP figures due next Wednesday may confirm that growth stalled over the summer. German exporting powerhouse seems to be suffering badly from America\u2019s protectionist stance on trade. The tariffs imposed on EU steel, and a swathe of Chinese products entering the US, are creating new frictions and dampening demand. Also coming up today Asian stock markets have rallied, as investors continue to welcome the US election results. Last night, the Dow jumped by 545 points (or 2.1%), the best day post-midterm rally since 1982, as Wall Street anticipated gridlock in Congress now the Democrats have control of the house. European markets are likely to gain ground at the open too, with the FTSE 100 called up 20 points: The European Commission issues its latest forecasts for the European economy this morning, and may confirm that growth is slowing. Investors will also be waiting to hear from the US Federal Reserve, when it sets monetary policy tonight. The Fed isn\u2019t expected to raise rates until December, but its views on the US economy may move the markets The agenda 10am GMT: European Commission 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless figures 7pm GMT: Federal Reserve interest rate decision",

Sainsbury\u2019s has faced criticism from customers and retail experts who have pointed to empty shelves and shabby stores since it took out thousands of management roles as part of a plan to cut \u00a3200m of costs this year. The company is also under pressure as it tries to push through a \u00a310bn merger with rival Asda, which is currently being assessed by the competition watchdog. Coupe said changes to store management had been made over the summer because the company expected aisles to be quiet while shoppers were away on holiday, but the company had been caught out by an unexpectedly busy period as the heatwave spurred a wave of barbecue parties. Coupe said stores were now back to normal with better availability than rivals \u2013 but said the job cuts were necessary to adapt to changing customer habits, which include shopping more online. \u201cI could go around any of our competitors and take photos of empty shelves. We are confident of underlying availability and service levels,\u201d Coupe said. Coupe made the comments as Sainsbury\u2019s revealed a 40% fall in pretax profits to \u00a3132m in the six months to 22 September, after hefty one-off costs, including \u00a369m on redundancies and other restructuring at its supermarkets; \u00a317m on preparing its bid for Asda, and \u00a340m on making changes at its bank. Underlying profits rose 20% as sales rose 3.5% to \u00a315.1bn. Sales in established stores rose by 1% in the second quarter, up from 0.2% in the previous three months, boosted by a marked increase in grocery sales despite the problems in stores. Analysts said Sainsbury\u2019s performance was better than expected as the heatwave boosted sales of groceries, including steaks and burgers, offsetting falling sales of clothing partly as a result of changes to the timing of discount sales. Sales of the company\u2019s premium Taste the Difference range rose 3%. Sales in supermarkets fell by 0.5% in the half year but sales in convenience stores rose 4.3% and online was up 6.9%. Coupe said Sainsbury\u2019s was on track to achieve expected profits for the year despite a \u201chighly competitive market\u201d. He said that Sainsbury\u2019s was expecting customers to splash out at Christmas as usual, but added \u201cclearly we have to strike a note of caution as this is an unprecedented time\u201d. Asked if Sainsbury\u2019s would be in trouble if it did not secure a merger with Asda, Coupe said: \u201cWe are confident in our future on whatever basis that future is.\u201d",

After more than a decade of failed attempts to revive the high street giant, Rowe gave a stark assessment of the chain\u2019s problems as it recorded a small increase in first-half profits. Its clothing arm had an \u201cageing\u201d customer base and dated stores, while its food halls were too expensive, with shoppers put off by \u201cconfusing\u201d promotions. \u201cAgainst the background of profound structural change in our industry, we are leaving no stone unturned,\u201d said Rowe. \u201cEvery aspect of our ranges \u2013 how we trade, our supply chain and marketing \u2013 is undergoing scrutiny and change. We\u2019re going bloody fast, trust me.\u201d Rowe\u2019s comments came as the group reported a 7.1% increase in pretax profits to \u00a3126.7m in the six months to 29 September. However, group sales declined 3.1% to \u00a35bn as it shut 24 stores as part of a plan to axe 100 branches by 2022. M&amp;S\u2019s share price closed down 0.5% at 300p. The profit figure was depressed by nearly \u00a3100m of one-off costs, around half of which related to the store closures. A further \u00a311.1m covered a round of management job cuts as the retailer tackled a corporate culture that was \u201csiloed, slow and hierarchical\u201d. In the absence of obvious signs of recovery, Archie Norman, the turnaround expert who took over as chairman a year ago, insisted that M&amp;S was a business where \u201cthings are really beginning to happen\u201d, with the figures \u201croughly what we expected them to be\u201d. \u201cA lot of it is behind the scenes, the blocking and tackling, the unglamorous things such as the supply chain \u2026 tackling a legacy that goes back decades,\u201d said Norman. \u201cIf Steve [Rowe] was Donald Trump, he would probably be declaring today\u2019s results a great personal victory, but that is not really quite the way we see it.\u201d Clothing sales at stores open for more than one year were down 1.1% hindered by poor stock levels on popular styles. M&amp;S recently hired the This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby to pick her clothing \u201cmust-haves\u201d for the season, but some of the outfits she picked, such as a \u00a349.50 leopard-print dress, sold out in several sizes within hours. \u201cWe are letting customers down with availability,\u201d said Rowe, who last year poached Jill McDonald from Halfords to lead the business. \u201cWe have some good products this season and the ranges are improving, but we are still in a position where we are buying too many [clothing] lines. The range is too broad and too shallow.\u201d Next season M&amp;S will buy more dresses and trousers in sizes eight through to 14, but fewer in a 16 and above, in a bid to improve stocks, he said. M&amp;S did not rule out further store closures as about third of the retailer\u2019s 1,029 stores date from before the second world war and some are located on ailing high streets. Rowe said: \u201cWe won\u2019t pause at 100. We have got to make sure that M&amp;S is relevant and fit for the future.\u201d The retailer is also weighing up redevelopment options for another 80 of its older stores, some of which are freehold sites. M&amp;S\u2019s previously reliable food business is also in trouble, with like-for-like sales down 2.9% in a competitive grocery market. Its food halls had become \u201cexcessively dependent\u201d on short-term promotions and multi-buys such as the popular but unprofitable \u201cDine In\u201d deal, Rowe said. It wants more families to shop regularly in its supermarkets, and its new food boss, Stuart Machin, is introducing bigger packs while lowering the prices of popular foods such as whole chickens and hamburgers to make them more affordable. Tom Stevenson of Fidelity Personal Investing said: \u201cReading through M&amp;S\u2019s results is like taking a cold shower. The company is ruthlessly honest about the massive challenge it faces. Sales are still declining, in the context of which flat profits is not a bad result.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK property market is at its weakest for six years, with prices flat or falling across half the country according to Britain\u2019s official surveyors body, with reports that sales are \u201cin limbo\u201d until a Brexit deal emerges. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said its monthly survey of members found \u201cthe weakest reading since September 2012\u201d in October, with prices falling in London, the south-east, south-west and East Anglia. Surveyors expect prices to continue to fall in these parts of the country for the next three months, although they are forecasting they will remain flat nationally over the next 12 months. Many surveyors said transaction activity has almost evaporated, as buyers refuse to strike a deal until there is some sort of certainty over Brexit. In Ealing, west London, surveyor Ronan McNamara of Robertson Smith and Kempson said: \u201cBrexit is the big issue. It has massively affected buyer confidence.\u201d Outside of London, the impact of Brexit on carmakers in Birmingham is also contributing to falling markets. Alex Smith, a surveyor in Birmingham said \u201cUncertainty in JLR [Jaguar Land Rover] and other associated motor trades\u201d was damaging market confidence. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Rics, said: \u201cThe uncertainty about the economic outlook on the back of the never-ending Brexit negotiations appears a key drag on sentiment.\u201d The Rics findings came just hours after Halifax, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, said annual house price growth has fallen to 1.5%, its lowest rate in more than five years. On a quarter on quarter basis, prices have crawled to a virtual halt, rising just 0.2%. A separate report from upmarket bank Coutts said prime central London is \u201cin limbo\u201d while the Brexit negotiations continue. It said prices were down 14.7% from their peak in 2014, and transaction activity had fallen by about a third. However, some parts of the UK are still experiencing brisk activity. Despite the Irish border remaining the thorniest issue around Brexit, the Norths\u2019s property market is booming. \u201cThe strongest growth [is] once again coming in Northern Ireland and Scotland,\u201d Rics said. In Belfast, surveyor Kirby O\u2019Connor of GOC estate agents said: \u201cThe sales market has been strong especially over the past month, we have noticed a strong appetite for investment.\u201d In Hexham, Northumberland, Neil Foster of Foster Maddison said: \u201cSales have remained consistent throughout October with little or no impact from daily hysteria in the media over Brexit.\u201d There was bad news for tenants, with Rics reporting that rents have begun to rise despite the slowdown in the residential sales market. It said there had been a \u201cmodest improvement in tenant demand during the three months to October\u201d, as landlords were selling up to avoid new buy-to-let taxation. But while demand is rising and supply is falling, Rics predicts only small rises in rents. According to separate data from Reapit, which manages software for letting and estate agents, rental demand has risen 13.3% in the past year while rental stock was down 6.9%. \u201cOver one in 10 landlords are actively looking to sell, compounding the issue,\u201d said Gary Barker of Reapit. \u201cAlthough our research shows that rents have stayed broadly flat over the past year, inevitably we are facing a continuing supply-side squeeze, which will lead to higher rents in the near future. There are simply not enough properties to meet demand, and tenants face rising costs in a turbulent economy.\u201d The housing market was boosted by the help-to-buy scheme announced by George Osborne in 2013. While Brexit dominates the sales market, property experts said other factors, such as stamp duty and interest rate rises, are also dampening market activity, particularly among higher-priced properties. \u201cFor properties marketed at over \u00a31m, close to three quarters of respondents reported sales prices were coming in below asking prices,\u201d Rics said. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, 14% cited sales prices were on average more than 10% below the initial asking price [up from 10% three months ago].\u201d",
