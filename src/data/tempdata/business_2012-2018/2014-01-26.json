      "bodyText": "Customers vented their anger on Sunday night after Lloyds and TSB became the latest high-street banks to experience a technological meltdown which led to many people being unable to withdraw money or use their cards. Furious customers complained of having to leave shopping behind at supermarket counters and being unable to pay restaurant bills. Lloyds said the problem was affecting debit cards and its internet banking service but not credit cards, while TSB said some customers were unable to use debit cards or withdraw money from ATMs. \"Wife's card declined in Asda had to go get my card from home how embarrassing standing and waiting #poorbankingservice\", said Carl Bullivant on Twitter. Jess McKell tweeted at TSB: \"not able to buy food this evening, or petrol to get home, this is ridiculous.\" Frank Nkparu asked: \"How a bank that makes hundreds of million pounds in profit can't have a reliable IT system for customers? @TSB and #Lloyds bank are #jokers\". The two banks became separate last year but operate for now under the Lloyds Bank group banner. The problems come after an estimated 750,000 RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank customers were unable to use their credit and debit cards for three hours last December. Paul Pester, TSB's chief executive, who used Twitter to talk directly to customers on Sunday evening, said that Lloyds, Halifax, Bank of Scotland and TSB use the same IT systems. In response to a tweet from one customer, he said that the problem had been caused by a server failing in the UK. Pester told another customer who complained that there had been no answer on the bank's helpline: \"sorry Craig. At one point we had 300 customers queuing to speak to the call centre \u2013 sorry if you couldn't get through.\" Lloyds later provided more details of the problem, which it said had resulted in some customers being unable to complete debit card transactions between 3pm and 6pm. It added: \"Although the majority of transactions were unaffected, we are very sorry for the inconvenience that this will have caused. At the same time, some customers encountered problems at approximately half of our 7,000 ATMs. This was resolved by 7.30pm, and all of our ATMs are now working.",

    "webTitle": "Davos 2014: looking back on a forum that was meant to look ahead", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "This was supposed to be the return to normal Davos. After all the years living in the shadow of the crisis, the World Economic Forum of 2014 was billed as the one that looked forward to the future not the past. The trouble is that the past doesn't seem to want to go away. There was the run on the Argentine peso that rekindled memories of the emerging market crises of the 1990s. There was the warning from Al Gore and Nick Stern, among many, that global warming was a more pressing issue now that it was before the financial crisis pushed climate change down the to-do lists of policymakers. Above all, there was the frightening comparison made by Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, that the current sour relations between his government and the communist regime in China had parallels with the Anglo-German tension in the run up to the outbreak of war in 1914. A military clash between Asia's two biggest economies is still seen as inconceivable, but even if it continues to be jaw-jaw rather than war-war in the Eastern Pacific the parallel drawn by Abe is relevant for three reasons. The first is that changes in the global balance of power cause instability as countries on the rise flex their muscles and countries on the wane seek to maintain their influence. One such period was the quarter-century from 1890 onwards, which saw the rise of Germany and the US. Another has been the collapse of the old bipolar cold war world and the emergence of China as an economic superpower since 1989. Second, these periods of change can go on for a long time. It took 30 years for stability to return after 1914, a period that included two world wars, the rise of totalitarianism and the great depression. Finally, as Mark Carney noted in Davos last week, mismanagement of economic shocks can delay the impact of technological breakthroughs. There was plenty of evidence in Davos that innovation has not ceased while the crisis has been raging. Ideas abound, in areas such as the life sciences, with the potential to transform economies and dispel the fears of the former US treasury secretary, Larry Summers, that this is an age of secular stagnation. But they will only flourish in the right climate. The final day of the World Economic Forum traditionally includes a roundtable on the state of the global economy, chaired by the Financial Times' chief economics commentator, Martin Wolf. This year's session was less good than usual, largely because the panel had too many people on it (the seven-strong cast list included the IMF chief, Christine Lagarde; the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney; the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi; the Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda; and the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble), resulting in none of them being able to say very much. It was also clear, though, that Lagarde, Draghi et al are fumbling around in the dark. Wolf described the mood as cautiously optimistic, which is a bit like him (uncharacteristically) ending a piece with the phrase time will tell. Cautiously optimistic and time will tell are just polite ways of saying I haven't got a clue. For what it's worth, here's how I see things. In the short run, the prospects for growth are better than people think. Sure, there's the potential for trouble in emerging markets but the response will be to keep economic policies looser for longer than it otherwise would have been. The Fed will slow down the gradual withdrawal of its policy stimulus, the Bank of Japan will step up its quantitative easing programme, and the ECB will ease policy to counter the threat of deflation. Carney had a difficult week trying to explain what Threadneedle Street's forward guidance on interest rates now meant following the sharper than expected fall in unemployment. He insisted nothing had really changed: borrowing costs will remain low. But as to the shape that forward guidance will take, that's a different matter. Will the Bank of England lower the threshold at which it starts discussing interest rate rises from an unemployment rate of 7% to a lower figure? Will it chose another economic variable \u2013 such as the growth in output or wages \u2013 to replace unemployment? Will it simply say the interest rates will stay low for a set period of time unless inflation picks up? Carney needs to come up with an answer in the next two weeks. At the moment, it is a case of time will tell. But for businesses and households in advanced countries thinking about borrowing money, the question is whether a tightening of policy is imminent and there is no sign that it is. In the UK, this sort of environment could easily prompt a long-awaited pick-up of investment during 2014, leading to further upward revisions to growth forecasts. The good news is unlikely to last. As the former head of the Financial Services Authority, Adair Turner, noted at a Davos breakfast last week, the remedy for the hangover caused by the last crisis is another stiff drink. Central banks are cautiously optimistic that they will be able to remove the stimulus at the right time and that they have new macro-prudential tools \u2013 such as the Bank of England's curbs on mortgage lending \u2013 that will prevent dangerous asset bubbles from developing. Summers said he doubted whether these macro-prudential measures would counter policy error and ignorance and he has a point. Central banks only spot bubbles when it is too late. So, while there is the risk of policy error, it is the risk that central banks will leave their foot on the accelerator for too long and that the vulnerability of an over-leveraged private sector will be exposed by a Black Swan event. In the longer term, the survival of the current economic model should not be taken for granted. Turner noted there was currently no alternative to growth cycles based on ever-higher levels of debt and leverage. The environmentalists said there was no alternative to growth based on an increase in CO2 emissions that on present trends would raise global temperatures by 4 to 5C by the 21st century. Trade unions warned that it was unsustainable for a small minority at the top to benefit from growth while workers were left jobless or saw living standards stagnate. These are all existential issues and there was not the remotest indication that Davos is yet to coming to grips with them. Last week the talk was of reshaping and rebooting the current model. It should have been about rethinking and recasting it.",

As the former head of the Financial Services Authority, Adair Turner, noted at a Davos breakfast last week, the remedy for the hangover caused by the last crisis is another stiff drink.</p> <p>Central banks are cautiously optimistic that they will be able to remove the stimulus at the right time and that they have new macro-prudential tools \u2013 such as the Bank of England's curbs on mortgage lending \u2013 that will prevent dangerous asset bubbles from developing.</p> <p>Summers said he doubted whether these macro-prudential measures would counter policy error and ignorance and he has a point. Central banks only spot bubbles when it is too late. So, while there is the risk of policy error, it is the risk that central banks will leave their foot on the accelerator for too long and that the vulnerability of an over-leveraged private sector will be exposed by a Black Swan event.</p> <p>In the longer term, the survival of the current economic model should not be taken for granted. Turner noted there was currently no alternative to growth cycles based on ever-higher levels of debt and leverage. The environmentalists said there was no alternative to growth based on an increase in CO2 emissions that on present trends would raise global temperatures by 4 to 5C by the 21st century. Trade unions warned that it was unsustainable for a small minority at the top to benefit from growth while workers were left jobless or saw living standards stagnate.</p> <p>These are all existential issues and there was not the remotest indication that Davos is yet to coming to grips with them. Last week the talk was of reshaping and rebooting the current model. It should have been about rethinking and recasting it.</p>",

A parade of retailers with a potential value of \u00a36bn is hoping to join the London stock market this year, cashing in on hopes of economic recovery and improving consumer confidence. Appliances Online, McColl's, Pets at Home and Boohoo.com are thought to be at the head of a pack of as many as 15 retailers looking to go public, with talk that some could formally announce their intentions within weeks. Owners may be keen to move swiftly, but with so many retail stocks looking to get off the blocks, investors can afford to be picky, and analysts agree that some of the initial public offerings (IPOs) about which there is so much breathless speculation will not make it to the market. City investors believe the proposals all need careful examination. One leading fund manager says: \"The quality of the pipeline is not fantastic. Some of these businesses have been around a while, and it's hard to see what's moved on.\" Another says: \"It is kite-flying at the moment. We will want a very close look at the financial data.\" He adds that firms that are toying with a trade sale (to another retailer) as an alternative to a stock market listing might see their value hit rather than boosted. With equity valuations high and a certain amount of cash floating around after multimillion-pound payouts by the likes of Vodafone, private equity owners see a chance to offload debt-laden retail businesses, which they have been sitting on for years, before a potential interest rate rise increases their costs. House of Fraser, Game and Fat Face may be shouting about booming sales over Christmas, but all have tricky histories: the department store chain and the clothing retailer were both snapped up by private equity investors at the height of the market, before the credit crunch kicked in. Companies with high levels of debt, particularly those that have passed through the hands of several private equity firms, will be most closely scrutinised. Investors had a rough ride with former private-equity-held businesses such as Debenhams. One investor says: \"We are always careful of anything coming from private equity.\" Tony Shiret, veteran retail analyst at Espirito Santo, says: \"I don't think investors will accept businesses with any meaningful debt.\" Investors are, he adds, aware that retailers that have already been stripped of costs by private equity firms could struggle to pay down debt if spending remains lacklustre. \"The consumer recovery is a bit unpredictable and it may be that the valuations talked about are illusory.\" The online-only retailers, discounters and specialists with room to grow may have the best stories to tell the City. Appliances Online and Boohoo.com are hoping they can ride the same wave of excitement that has lifted shares in fellow e-tailers Asos and Ocado to all-time highs in the past year.

All the polls show that a few votes in 100 marginal seats will be decisive.</p> <p>Then David Cameron plays a trump card. A round robin letter signed by 200 UK chief executives is published by the <em>Financial Times</em>. The message is clear: \"Business thinks a Labour government would be a disaster for Britain.\"</p> <p>So much, so obvious. Business never wants a Labour government. It tends to prefer the Conservatives in power because that means lower taxes, less interference from Whitehall and a government that tends to side with employers rather than the unions.</p> <p>Even so, the bad-mouthing of Ed&#xa0;Miliband and his team in Davos last week was more vitriolic than usual. Business really has it in for the opposition leader and his team.</p> <p>Now, the Labour leader might welcome the fact that he has got under the business world's skin, just as FDR in 1936 said he relished the fact that he was loathed by Wall Street.</p> <p>But Roosevelt was by then a wildly popular leader seeking re-election after presiding over America's recovery from the depths of the 1930s recession.

      "bodyText": "Imagine the scene. It is April 2015 and the general election campaign is in full swing. As expected, it looks like being the closest of races. All the polls show that a few votes in 100 marginal seats will be decisive. Then David Cameron plays a trump card. A round robin letter signed by 200 UK chief executives is published by the Financial Times. The message is clear: \"Business thinks a Labour government would be a disaster for Britain.\" So much, so obvious. Business never wants a Labour government. It tends to prefer the Conservatives in power because that means lower taxes, less interference from Whitehall and a government that tends to side with employers rather than the unions. Even so, the bad-mouthing of Ed Miliband and his team in Davos last week was more vitriolic than usual. Business really has it in for the opposition leader and his team. Now, the Labour leader might welcome the fact that he has got under the business world's skin, just as FDR in 1936 said he relished the fact that he was loathed by Wall Street. But Roosevelt was by then a wildly popular leader seeking re-election after presiding over America's recovery from the depths of the 1930s recession. Miliband, by contrast, leads a party that is given little credit for all the good things that it did between 1997 and 2010 but is blamed for everything that went wrong. Nor should he be under any illusions about the anti-Labour mood in the boardroom. In Davos on Friday, Mark Carney was asked what, \"apart from the two words Ed and Balls\", stood between Britain and the sunny uplands. The Bank of England governor seemed taken aback that the question had been couched in such a partisan way. Summing up at the end of the same lunch, the boss of media group WPP, Sir Martin Sorrell, said the Conservatives would walk the next election if Cameron dropped his commitment to hold an in-out referendum on UK membership of the EU \u2013 one area of policy where the view of a largely pro-European business community is closer to that of Labour. Sorrell, of course, stuck the knife into Gordon Brown before the last election by removing his company HQ from Britain to Ireland to cut its tax bill, only to return it once Cameron was PM. Labour should not expect to be treated any more kindly by business in 2015 than it was last time. Anti-Labour sentiment will be couched carefully. Business will say that Miliband wants to extend state control and burden companies with excessive regulation. He will be castigated for having proposed a price freeze on energy companies. This is mostly cant. What business leaders really fear is that a new Labour government would put up the top rate of income tax. Even so, on the basis of what was being said both privately and publicly in Davos next week, Miliband needs to be aware of three things. First, business doesn't like what he is saying. Second, they don't like the way he is saying it. Third, they will get increasingly vociferous about it as the election nears. Peter Mandelson, who was business secretary at the time of the 2010 election, said the letter that business leaders sent to the Telegraph backing George Osborne had been seriously damaging to Labour's prospects at the time. A repeat in 2015 could be equally harmful, which is why those on the left attacking Balls for his fiscal rectitude need to cut the shadow chancellor some slack. Miliband's populist approach may appeal to the people over the heads of business, but Labour needs to make sure its macroeconomic approach is watertight. Hodge scare stories are nonsense Does the silly season now come early? We are more than six months away from the dog days of August, when newspapers are regularly lampooned for filling their pages with stories that may be, occasionally, a tad absurd. But last week there was a string of pieces about Margaret Hodge \"scaring firms away from the UK\" \u2013 comments emanating apparently from a Treasury source. There is little doubt that George Osborne's acolytes might be capable of spinning such nonsense, or that certain business leaders have indeed been whingeing about the robust style of Hodge, who is the high-profile chair of the parliamentary accounts committee. But undermining investment in Britain? Come on. Starbucks, Google and Amazon surely did not enjoy having to justify their tax affairs in front of Hodge and the PAC.

Clearly those companies that don't like that can go elsewhere: to Azerbaijan, perhaps, or other places where corporate social responsibility only extends to an occasional grovelling phone call to the president. The wrong number for customers The O2 mobile network is celebrating the new year with a 2.7% inflation-linked price rise. Those affected are the 8 million people who have signed up to long airtime contracts \u2013 typically two years \u2013 in exchange for a shiny new smartphone. Unheard of a few years ago, mid-contract price rises have become all the rage of late, pushed through by all the major operators, from Vodafone to Virgin Media. O2's announcement came on Thursday, just hours after Ofcom had apparently quashed such practices. It had introduced new rules designed to allow anyone signing a contract from 23 January to walk away without a financial penalty, and in some cases with their smartphone, if the price went up unexpectedly. But O2 has found a workaround.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The economy may be adding jobs at a rate of 50,000 a month, according to last week's figures, but some corners of the country, hit by heavy cuts and closures, are struggling. Thanet, the easternmost tip of Kent, where Ramsgate and Margate jut into the North Sea, has been trying for two years to recover from the blow of US pharmaceutical company Pfizer's decision to close its sprawling hi-tech research centre near Sandwich, putting 3,000 skilled workers out of a job. The entire local economy, already blighted by some of the UK's highest youth unemployment rates, felt the effects, and the closure has been blamed for the district's lurch to the right in last year's local elections, when Ukip came second to the Tories. Party leader Nigel Farage is considering running for Thanet South, where the party is polling 30%, in next year's general election. Western parts of Kent, such as Tunbridge Wells and Maidstone, look and feel like satellites of the capital, comfortable in their share of renewed economic growth, expected to have been around 0.7% in the last quarter. But the far east of the county has pockets of deprivation to rival the north of the UK. Ramsgate, Margate and Broadstairs have in recent years seen a sharp decline in seaside visitors, the collapse of the Ramsgate ferry port and the closure of Margate's Dreamland amusements complex. With Pfizer gone, there is a dearth of big businesses operating in the area. Margate, the much-discussed focus of Mary Portas's high street regeneration efforts, is still blighted, with one in four shops boarded up. Over the district boundary to the south, Dover has suffered a similar decline, losing a third of its channel ferry business, mostly to tunnel operator Eurotunnel. David Foley, head of Thanet and East Kent chamber of commerce, is optimistic about the region's prospects but despairs at the overlapping planning responsibilities of Thanet and Kent councils and the conflicts among the many funding bodies pumping money into the region. He angrily tells the tale of the county council and East Kent Opportunities (EKO), a body it funds, taking Thanet district council to court over proposals \u2013 blocked by the council's planning committee \u2013 for 650 homes on a mixed-use industrial park based around Manston airport. Meanwhile, the Manston Park development has struggled to attract business tenants. Another victim of overlapping planning responsibilities is the Flambeau plastics factory, on the edge of Ramsgate. Managing director John Wingfield has successfully fought off Chinese competition to make buckets and toolboxes for building materials company Jewson, and a range of parts for car assembly plants in the Midlands. Flambeau's American owners are frustrated that the dilapidated factory does not come up to the required health and safety standards for manufacturing medical equipment. But the truth is that millions of pounds needs to be ploughed into new facilities just to save the existing jobs. (And, as with many capital-intensive businesses, even an expansion of output would create few new jobs.) Spending to stand still is the new reality in an age when all Flambeau's plastics-making kit can easily be shipped to a new site. An enterprise zone in, say, the Midlands, offering a tax-free existence, could well tempt the business away \u2013 in fact it could move almost anywhere in Europe, which it serves for its US parent. East Kent does have its own enterprise zone, in the shape of the 50-year-old Pfizer site. In 2012 it was taken over by a consortium that has already made a success of an abandoned factory in Teesside, attracting 65 firms that employ 2,000 workers. The Pfizer site, renamed Discovery Park, was promptly awarded tax-free status by the government, along with 12 other sites around the country. Pfizer still has 600 employees working there, in a building it rents from Discovery Park, and another 400 people now work there too, mostly in micro businesses that have taken up residence in the site's office blocks. Anne Stone, leasing manager, says the target is 3,000 employees by 2017: \"We were seen as outsiders at the beginning, and local people were suspicious of our motives, but now they are right behind the project.\" But Thanet council leader Clive Hart \u2013 at the head of a minority Labour administration that benefited from Ukip splitting the Tory vote \u2013 says this is hampering his own regeneration efforts. While a fan of Discovery Park, he points out that its enterprise zone status means it can offer five years' tax-free trading, which makes it more attractive than the two business parks in his district. The idea of tax breaks is to create new jobs, he says, not to allow one area to steal from others. Hart is keen to push through the housebuilding and business development plans that are already in the pipeline, and as a member of EKO is part of the consortium fighting the planning department's rejection of the Manston homes. He supports plans to lease the Ramsgate port to a new operator \u2013 even though \u00a33.5m was lost in unpaid fees when the last one went bust \u2013 and revamping the amusements complex. after a local trust raised \u00a310m from the government's SeaChange fund, the National Lottery and others to transform it into a heritage-themed amusement park Other projects are mired in planning wrangles or lack funds. Manston airport was famed for its extra-long runway \u2013 badly damaged planes were able to land there having struggled back from the continent during the second world war \u2013 but is now a low-key commercial destination for Kenyan flowers and fresh vegetables, and has a twice-daily KLM slot to Amsterdam. Hopes it would be part of Howard Davies's plans for a ring of London airports were dashed when the report he published just before Christmas focused on Heathrow and Gatwick. Stagecoach founder Ann Gloag recently bought the site, and its debt, but has yet to make clear her intentions. The airport's chief executive, Charles Buchanan, believes Gloag is ready to be the next Richard Branson and will develop passenger flights from Manston, but she could just as easily apply to build houses there. Kent's local authorities are under intense pressure to build homes. An application for a second development of 850 homes, also next to the airport, is going through the planning process. Separately, local papers have reported interest in buying and renting from several London boroughs in need of properties for housing benefit claimants. Green councillor Ian Driver accuses council leader Hart of trying to reinvent the past. He says plans for the airport and commercial port in Ramsgate are doomed to fail, and the emphasis should be on developing local culture and attracting visitors. Improvements to the HS1 high speed rail link from London will help the area win business, he says, but mostly offer Margate and Ramsgate the opportunity to triumph in the way Brighton has. Where the train from London to Margate once took two-and-a-quarter hours, it now takes 90 minutes. With HS1 possibly cutting that time to just over an hour, it's no wonder the scheme is seen by all as the region's saviour. Even with the longer train journey, Margate's Turner Contemporary gallery has succeeded in attracting over a million visitors since it opened in 2011. The gallery's director, Victoria Pomery, is keen to point out that so far the gallery has generated around \u00a36m a year of additional spending and supported an estimated 130 jobs. At \u00a317m, it is an expensive jobs generator, but Hart at the council and Foley at the chamber of commerce are convinced that it can be the foundation stone for further regeneration.

      "body": "<p>The economy may be adding jobs at a rate of 50,000 a month, according to last week's figures, but some corners of the country, hit by heavy cuts and closures, are struggling. Thanet, the easternmost tip of Kent, where Ramsgate and Margate jut into the North Sea, has been trying for two years to recover from the blow of US pharmaceutical company Pfizer's decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/23/budget-2011-sandwich-pfizer-jobs\" title=\"\">close its sprawling hi-tech research centre near Sandwich</a>, putting 3,000 skilled workers out of a job.</p> <p>The entire local economy, already blighted by some of the UK's highest youth unemployment rates, felt the effects, and the closure has been blamed for the district's lurch to the right in last year's local elections, when Ukip came second to the Tories. Party leader Nigel Farage is considering running for Thanet South, where the party is polling 30%, in next year's general election.</p> <p>Western parts of Kent, such as Tunbridge Wells and Maidstone, look and feel like satellites of the capital, comfortable in their share of renewed economic growth, expected to have been around 0.7% in the last quarter. But the far east of the county has pockets of deprivation to rival the north of the UK. Ramsgate, Margate and Broadstairs have in recent years seen a sharp decline in seaside visitors, the collapse of the Ramsgate ferry port and the closure of Margate's Dreamland amusements complex.</p> <p>With Pfizer gone, there is a dearth of big businesses operating in the area. Margate, the much-discussed focus of Mary Portas's high street regeneration efforts, is still blighted, with one in four shops boarded up. Over the district boundary to the south, Dover has suffered a similar decline, losing a third of its channel ferry business, mostly to tunnel operator Eurotunnel.</p> <p>David Foley, head of Thanet and East Kent chamber of commerce, is optimistic about the region's prospects but despairs at the overlapping planning responsibilities of Thanet and Kent councils and the conflicts among the many funding bodies pumping money into the region.</p> <p>He angrily tells the tale of the county council and East Kent Opportunities (EKO), a body it funds, taking Thanet district council to court over proposals \u2013 blocked by the council's planning committee \u2013 for 650 homes on a mixed-use industrial park based around Manston airport. Meanwhile, the Manston Park development has struggled to attract business tenants.</p> <p>Another victim of overlapping planning responsibilities is the Flambeau plastics factory, on the edge of Ramsgate. Managing director John Wingfield has successfully fought off Chinese competition to make buckets and toolboxes for building materials company Jewson, and a range of parts for car assembly plants in the Midlands.</p> <p>Flambeau's American owners are frustrated that the dilapidated factory does not come up to the required health and safety standards for manufacturing medical equipment. But the truth is that millions of pounds needs to be ploughed into new facilities just to save the existing jobs. (And, as with many capital-intensive businesses, even an expansion of output would create few new jobs.)</p> <p>Spending to stand still is the new reality in an age when all Flambeau's plastics-making kit can easily be shipped to a new site. An enterprise zone in, say, the Midlands, offering a tax-free existence, could well tempt the business away \u2013 in fact it could move almost anywhere in Europe, which it serves for its US parent.</p> <p>East Kent does have its own enterprise zone, in the shape of the 50-year-old Pfizer site. In 2012 it was taken over by a consortium that has already made a success of an abandoned factory in Teesside, attracting 65 firms that employ 2,000 workers. The Pfizer site, renamed Discovery Park, was promptly awarded tax-free status by the government, along with 12 other sites around the country.</p> <p>Pfizer still has 600 employees working there, in a building it rents from Discovery Park, and another 400 people now work there too, mostly in micro businesses that have taken up residence in the site's office blocks.</p> <p>Anne Stone, leasing manager, says the target is 3,000 employees by 2017: \"We were seen as outsiders at the beginning, and local people were suspicious of our motives, but now they are right behind the project.\"</p> <p>But Thanet council leader Clive Hart \u2013 at the head of a minority Labour administration that benefited from Ukip splitting the Tory vote \u2013 says this is hampering his own regeneration efforts. While a fan of Discovery Park, he points out that its enterprise zone status means it can offer five years' tax-free trading, which makes it more attractive than the two business parks in his district. The idea of tax breaks is to create new jobs, he says, not to allow one area to steal from others.</p> <p>Hart is keen to push through the housebuilding and business development plans that are already in the pipeline, and as a member of EKO is part of the consortium fighting the planning department's rejection of the Manston homes. He supports plans to lease the Ramsgate port to a new operator \u2013 even though \u00a33.5m was lost in unpaid fees when the last one went bust \u2013 and revamping the amusements complex. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/07/margate-dreamland-seaside-regeneration\" title=\"\">after a local trust raised \u00a310m</a> from the government's SeaChange fund, the National Lottery and others to transform it into a heritage-themed amusement park</p> <p>Other projects are mired in planning wrangles or lack funds. Manston airport was famed for its extra-long runway \u2013 badly damaged planes were able to land there having struggled back from the continent during the second world war \u2013 but is now a low-key commercial destination for Kenyan flowers and fresh vegetables, and has a twice-daily KLM slot to Amsterdam. Hopes it would be part of Howard Davies's plans for a ring of London airports were dashed when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/16/heathrow-airport-expansion-davies-commission-interim-report\" title=\"\">the report he published just before Christmas</a> focused on Heathrow and Gatwick.</p> <p>Stagecoach founder Ann Gloag recently bought the site, and its debt, but has yet to make clear her intentions. The airport's chief executive, Charles Buchanan, believes Gloag is ready to be the next Richard Branson and will develop passenger flights from Manston, but she could just as easily apply to build houses there.</p> <p>Kent's local authorities are under intense pressure to build homes. An application for a second development of 850 homes, also next to the airport, is going through the planning process. Separately, local papers have reported interest in buying and renting from several London boroughs in need of properties for housing benefit claimants.</p> <p>Green councillor Ian Driver accuses council leader Hart of trying to reinvent the past. He says plans for the airport and commercial port in Ramsgate are doomed to fail, and the emphasis should be on developing local culture and attracting visitors.</p> <p>Improvements to the HS1 high speed rail link from London will help the area win business, he says, but mostly offer Margate and Ramsgate the opportunity to triumph in the way Brighton has. Where the train from London to Margate once took two-and-a-quarter hours, it now takes 90 minutes. With HS1 possibly cutting that time to just over an hour, it's no wonder the scheme is seen by all as the region's saviour.</p> <p>Even with the longer train journey, Margate's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/08/turner-contemporary-gallery-regional-arts\" title=\"\">Turner Contemporary gallery</a> has succeeded in attracting over a million visitors since it opened in 2011. The gallery's director, Victoria Pomery, is keen to point out that so far the gallery has generated around \u00a36m a year of additional spending and supported an estimated 130 jobs. At \u00a317m, it is an expensive jobs generator, but Hart at the council and Foley at the chamber of commerce are convinced that it can be the foundation stone for further regeneration.</p> <p>But others remain to be persuaded that copying areas such as north Norfolk and Brighton by favouring cultural businesses is a better bet than spending scarce funds on reviving the sectors that once dominated this part of Kent.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The news that unemployment is falling \u2013 and faster than most forecasters expected, not least the Bank of England \u2013 is extremely good news. It was the memory of the high unemployment between the first and second world wars that drove governments to make the pursuit of high, indeed \"full\", employment a supreme goal of economic policy for many decades after 1945. Indeed, it was curiosity that there should be unemployment at all that first interested my mentor at the Financial Times, Sir Samuel Brittan, in the subject of economics. (Sir Samuel has recently celebrated his 80th birthday and is as interested as ever.) Of course, policymakers could never really achieve full employment. There was bound to be some unemployment, called \"frictional\", as people changed jobs. But in the 1950s the conduct of economic policy was so successful that rates of 1.5%-2% were considered perfectly normal. The aim was to maximise economic growth and employment, provided inflation was kept under control and the balance of overseas payments (exports and imports) was manageable. Well, whole libraries have been filled on the problems that arose after the 1950s, and policymakers faced no shortage of problems with inflation and the balance of payments. But one thing they could take for granted until 2007-08 was a reasonably well-functioning banking system. It was Gladstone who put it succinctly: \"Finance is, as it were, the stomach of the country, from which all the other organs take their tone.\" The banking crisis, as we know, led to the recent depression, a depression that in my opinion was severely aggravated by mistaken policies. It was therefore interesting to hear Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the urbane permanent secretary to the Treasury, reflect recently on the achievements, or lack of them, of British economic policymakers in general over the years, and of the Treasury in particular. In his lecture to the Mile End Group on 15 January, Macpherson made no secret of his admiration for Gladstone and the 20th century Labour chancellor Philip Snowden, both of whom are often accused of being more concerned with balancing the budget than balancing the economy. His lecture \u2013 The Treasury View: a Testament of Experience \u2013 is well worth reading in full. After running through all the \"panaceas\" on which policymakers placed their counter-inflationary bets \u2013 from incomes policy to monetary targets, shadowing the deutschmark and entering (and exiting) the ERM \u2013 they eventually arrived at \"inflation targeting\". Like the good public servant he is, Macpherson managed the transition from Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling's Treasury to George Osborne's \u2013 an example to those who would \"politicise\" the civil service. He is in his 30th year at the Treasury, and has counted them all in, and counted them all out. He says: \"The Treasury exists to serve the government of the day: to promote and achieve its objectives in the financial and economic field\u2026 It needs to understand, interpret and apply the philosophy and agenda of the governing party (or parties).\" But experienced officials ought to be able to offer an understanding of what works and what doesn't. Well, the Treasury has had plenty of experience of that, but nevertheless found itself deficient in resources and experience when the bankers almost brought the entire edifice down. Macpherson has certainly tried to make up for lost time. And he is frank about one of the great policy mistakes of the 1990s and early 2000s: the belief that price stability would bring overall stability, and the lack of attention to the growth of credit. \"Looking back to the last decade,\" said Macpherson, \"I think senior Treasury officials \u2013 myself included \u2013 became mesmerised by the length of the upswing.\" It was not just Brown! Macpherson enunciated a number of propositions, one of which was that there are limits to what the state can do to regulate demand, another that fiscal policy should support monetary policy. When your correspondent asked him whether he thought fiscal policy was supporting monetary policy at that crucial time in the summer of 2010 when the new chancellor raised VAT sharply and stopped the recovery in its tracks, he said he had feared \"an inflection point\", at which there would be problems selling government debt. I disagree. The Debt Management Office was having the time of its life selling debt with an average maturity of 14 years \u2013 and not, as in the case of Greece, worrying about where the next investor was coming from. Interestingly, the permanent secretary distances himself from Osborne's (and the Bank's) absurd comparisons of our problems then to those of Athens. At all events, the latest economic panacea in trouble appears to be Mark Carney's \"forward guidance\" and associated forecasts that have made the new governor a laughing stock. But for those of us who have always worried about unemployment, it remains good news that it is falling \u2013 and, personally, I have not lost faith that higher productivity will follow. However, output is still 2% below its 2007 peak, and if past trends had continued, GDP would now be 20% higher than it is. Personally, I am less concerned about the disarray of Carney's forward guidance than with his apparent lack of concern about bankers' so-called \"remuneration\".",

      "bodyText": "Cast your mind back to the end of the last millennium and the dotcom boom. Companies were floating on the stock market left, right and centre, often with very little in the way of sales, let alone profits. It was \"a new paradigm\", according to Lastminute.com's Martha Lane Fox. But Lastminute's flotation in March 2000 proved to be almost the last hurrah and the FTSE 100, which reached a peak of 6930 at the end of December 1999, went tumbling the following year. Boom became bust. Thirteen years later, the FTSE 100 is once again in sight of those all-time highs (see graph), and flotation fever is back. The index came within 65 points of its record last week, before investors had a mild attack of nerves. Stock markets have been supported by the wall of money thrown up by central banks, notably the US Federal Reserve, in their efforts to keep the global economy from slipping into the abyss. So far those efforts seem to be working. And with signs of optimism about global growth, including recent positive data from China, the US, UK and even the troubled eurozone, most observers believe 2014 will see yet new peaks for shares. UBS and Killik, for example, are forecasting the FTSE 100 will reach 7400 by the end of the year, while Citigroup reckons it could break through 8000. Even the prospect of an end to central bank stimulus does not seem to hold as much fear as it once did. The US Federal Reserve began trimming, or \"tapering\", its bond-buying programme last month, cutting the monthly purchases by $10bn to $75bn, but the market took the news in its stride. Philip Shaw at Investec said: \"Stock markets are no longer fazed by Fed tapering. Indeed, the S&amp;P 500 has hit repeated highs since the Fed announced a reduction in its asset purchase programme on 18 December.\" And with bond yields low, interest rates at virtually zero and precious metal prices plunging, there are few options other than the stock market for investors seeking a home for their cash. That pool of cash seeking a home will be boosted in March when some \u00a350bn is returned to Vodafone investors following the sale of the mobile phone group's stake in US joint venture Verizon Wireless. So it is not surprising this buoyant mood has encouraged company owners \u2013 from family businesses to private-equity-controlled firms to the UK government \u2013 to join the rush to market. Last year 105 companies joined the main market and the smaller Aim, the largest number since 2007, raising a total of \u00a315.7bn between them. Esure, Foxtons, Merlin Entertainments and \u2013 of course \u2013 Royal Mail are all recent arrivals and the pipeline of flotations is growing by the day. But it may not all be plain sailing. The ending of central bank stimulus, when it finally comes, could prove more disruptive than expected, especially for emerging markets. Currency problems in Argentina could have a knock-on effect elsewhere, while there is always room for disappointment if global growth fails to meet expectations. A potential housing bubble in the UK could be storing up problems for the future. Geopolitical concerns too should not be underestimated, whether regarding Syria, Iran or even Japan, whose prime minister Shinzo Abe raised the prospect in Davos last week of a possible conflict between his country and China. But for the moment, the bulls are in the ascendancy and private businesses are riding the wave. Just be cautious if anyone uses the phrase \"new paradigm\".",

The US Federal Reserve began trimming, or \"tapering\", its bond-buying programme last month, cutting the monthly purchases by $10bn to $75bn, but the market took the news in its stride.</p> <p>Philip Shaw at Investec said: \"Stock markets are no longer fazed by Fed tapering. Indeed, the S&amp;P 500 has hit repeated highs since the Fed announced a reduction in its asset purchase programme on 18 December.\"</p> <p>And with bond yields low, interest rates at virtually zero and precious metal prices plunging, there are few options other than the stock market for investors seeking a home for their cash.</p> <p>That pool of cash seeking a home will be boosted in March when some \u00a350bn is returned to Vodafone investors following the sale of the mobile phone group's stake in US joint venture Verizon Wireless.</p> <p>So it is not surprising this buoyant mood has encouraged company owners \u2013 from family businesses to private-equity-controlled firms to the UK government \u2013 to join the rush to market. Last year 105 companies joined the main market and the smaller Aim, the largest number since 2007, raising a total of \u00a315.7bn between them. Esure, Foxtons, Merlin Entertainments and \u2013 of course \u2013 Royal Mail are all recent arrivals and the pipeline of flotations is growing by the day.</p> <p>But it may not all be plain sailing. The ending of central bank stimulus, when it finally comes, could prove more disruptive than expected, especially for emerging markets. Currency problems in Argentina could have a knock-on effect elsewhere, while there is always room for disappointment if global growth fails to meet expectations. A potential housing bubble in the UK could be storing up problems for the future.</p> <p>Geopolitical concerns too should not be underestimated, whether regarding Syria, Iran or even Japan, whose prime minister Shinzo Abe raised the prospect in Davos last week of a possible conflict between his country and China. But for the moment, the bulls are in the ascendancy and private businesses are riding the wave. Just be cautious if anyone uses the phrase \"new paradigm\".</p>",
