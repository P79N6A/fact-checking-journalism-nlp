      "bodyText": "There is a scene in the 2002 film Minority Report where Tom Cruise walks into a clothes store and a computer scans his eyes. \"Hello Mr Yakamoto, welcome back to the Gap,\" chirrups a sales assistant in hologram form. \"How'd those assorted tank tops work out for you?\" Brands from Nokia to Bulgari collaborated in the Steven Spielberg film to paint a picture of what a shopping trip might look like in 2054. But we may not have to wait that long \u2013 science fiction could become reality later this year. In the real world, though, individual shoppers will be identified not by iris scans, but by the portable devices in our pockets. The UK's three largest mobile phone networks, EE, Vodafone and O2, have joined forces to turn smartphones into virtual wallets that know who we are, where we are and what we buy. \"Imagine: you are walking past Topshop and an alert pops up on your phone offering you a discount in store today,\" says David Sear. The new chief executive of Weve, the company set up by the networks to manage the mobile wallet project, is giving his first interview. You'd then walk into the store, pick out a purchase, scan the barcode, and pay by tapping your phone on an Oyster-card-style reader, rather than at the till. \"It is a bit of joy,\" claims Sear. Bargain lovers would agree; others might find it intrusive. To those standing in line to pay, it could seem downright rude. The idea is not a new one, but despite the efforts of companies ranging from Google to Barclays it has yet to gain traction with consumers. Google Wallet, launched in the US in 2011, has not made it to these shores. But Weve says 15 million mobile phone customers have already opted in to its service. At the moment, those users receive nothing more than text messages alerting them to offers. But within months, Weve says it will have opened its database, allowing companies that buy advertising slots on web pages access to data ranging from users' physical location to the websites they visit on their phones. Before the end of the year, Sear hopes to have created an app capable of holding dozens of virtual loyalty cards, and to have recruited its first brand. Payment mechanisms will follow. \"My background is in disruption,\" says Sear, who has made his career with payments firms that challenged the big banks. An early venture used data to help retailers spot cheques that would bounce. At online transactions firm WorldPay he helped shoppers in one country buy goods in their own currency from sellers abroad. \"I succeeded with the cheque business because we enabled people to do things at the point of sale which they couldn't do before,\" says Sear. \"I have 17 loyalty cards sitting in my sock drawer because I can't be bothered to carry them all around. I think there's a real opportunity to create one place where you might hold competing loyalty mechanisms.\" But why should an unwieldy coalition of mobile phone firms, more used to competing than collaborating, succeed where a digital native like Google has so far come unstuck? \"People in the loyalty industry know what Google wants: their data. One of the large US supermarket chief executives said the thing he didn't want to do was give Google his data. Whatever we do, it has to be a coalition of the willing.\" Weve claims it will share details of every purchase with the relevant loyalty card issuer. The system will also ask mobile phone customers to opt in, rather than acting like Facebook and Google and assuming users will accept advertising in exchange for a free service. For the networks behind Weve, this is one of the advantages of having paying customers. Facebook has to presume we want advertising because it has few other sources of revenue, but mobile phone companies can afford to be a little less pushy. \"We want consumers to have bought into the value of the service,\" says Sear. He is particularly critical of Facebook Home, a new app from the social network that takes over a smartphone's home screen to display ads alongside news and photographs from friends. \"I personally do not want to see ads popping up on my phone when the screen is locked. In Facebook's case I don't think they are really asking for permission; it's just part of the deal you sign up to on that system.\" Weve will not be a consumer brand. The networks will sign up customers themselves, using a dashboard of information-sharing options. Details shared could range from the first part of a postcode to age, gender, location, web browsing history and likes or dislikes. Some will be compulsory, some optional, and the requirements will vary by network. Google has a similar dashboard, but few users are aware of its existence. \"The consumer is more powerful in this stage of our digital revolution than I think they have ever been, and they will decide whether or not something is appropriate,\" says Sear. Security is another factor. When Weve is ready to link a customer's debit card to their phone so that they can make payments, those details will be held on the Sim card. Should the phone be lost or stolen, the data can be remotely deleted by the operator. Memory wiping was a favourite theme of Philip K Dick, on whose writing Minority Report was based. The film was made not long after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre, and Spielberg remarked at the time: \"People are willing to give away a lot of their freedoms in order to feel safe. But the question is, where do you draw the line? How much freedom are you willing to give up?\" This applies increasingly to the trade-off between free services and private information. Those signing up for Weve's service will at least be offered the choice.",

      "bodyText": "The late Eddie George, in 2002, brought the phrase \"two-speed economy\" into common parlance, telling an audience in Scotland: \"We have taken the view that unbalanced growth in our present situation is better than no growth \u2013 or, as some commentators have put it, a two-speed economy is better than a no-speed economy.\" But his words could just as well have been applied to last week's GDP figures. While it was undoubtedly great news that the UK has skirted around a \"triple dip\", the breakdown of the numbers suggested that, far from achieving the rebalancing George Osborne hoped for, away from consumers and towards industry, the mix of growth looks much as it did a decade ago. Manufacturing output declined; services expanded; government spending made a positive contribution. Industrial output is still 10% below its pre-crisis peak. Yet far from acting to redress the balance, the coalition's latest policies read like a desperate attempt to return to the unstable, unsustainable norms of the early noughties. Help to Buy, announced in the budget, will offer taxpayer backing for up to \u00a3130bn worth of mortgage lending, while last week's extension of the Funding for Lending scheme will allow banks to receive \u00a310 of cheap funding for every pound they lend to small businesses in 2013 \u2013 and lend it back out again in any way they like, including to buy-to-let investors. Back in 2002, George wanted to reassure consumers they would not face a runup in interest rates \u2013 because with other sources of growth, such as industry and exports, struggling, the Bank was willing to allow Britain's shoppers to continue propping up demand with their buy now, pay later spending habits rather than risk economic stagnation. When he spoke, the cost of the average home was less than \u00a396,000, though prices were already rising at double-digit rates; by the peak of the boom, little more than five years later, it had all but doubled, to \u00a3183,959. Alongside that extraordinary growth in house prices came an unprecedented explosion in household debt. But constantly rising prices bred a warm feeling of confidence among homeowners and fuelled a sense of entitlement to the unearned benefits of rampant housing-market inflation, creating a ready-made lobby group opposing changes to inheritance tax, council tax or any other method of sharing the windfall more widely. In Osborne's first, \"emergency\", budget in 2010, he carefully laid out his intention of building a safer, more stable economy, less reliant on debt-fuelled spending. Yet three years on, scarred by the failure of the pound's 20% depreciation to spark an industrial renaissance, he appears to be banking on the two-speed doctrine to lift him clear of trouble. Osborne has insisted that Help to Buy is not aimed at pushing up prices. But encouraging first-time buyers to take out mortgages with high loan-to-value ratios \u2013 on properties whose value may be unsustainable even at current levels, let alone after another market bounce \u2013 is hardly a recipe for a fairer or more stable economy. The Treasury claims to hope the policy will stimulate housebuilding, helping to ease the chronic shortage of homes that has driven up prices; but as the Treasury select committee rightly pointed out in its report on the budget, if the government really wanted to kickstart building, it should act to do so directly. That might mean taking advantage of record low gilt yields to invest in council housing, for example. But as Pete Jefferys of Shelter put it in a blog last week, Help to Buy is a \"Thatcher-style home ownership revolution, not a Macmillan-style housebuilding boom\". Neither does pumping out a new generation of cut-price loans \u2013 which, remember, will be available to anyone buying a house worth up to \u00a3600,000 \u2013 tackle the problem of banks still saddled with shaky-looking mortgages from the boom years. It just postpones the reckoning \u2013 and risks making it worse when it comes. There is agreement across the political spectrum that Britain faces a housing crisis: a generation of young people have little or no prospect of affording a place to live, and find themselves trapped in insecure, poor-quality rental housing owned by landlords out to make a quick buck. But first-time buyers need cheaper homes, not bigger loans, and the chancellor's argument is reminiscent of those who used to claim vehemently in the mid-noughties that allowing low-paid workers to borrow six times their income was socially necessary, because otherwise young people wouldn't be able to afford a home. A mass programme of publicly funded housebuilding, along the lines stirringly recreated in Ken Loach's documentary The Spirit of '45, could boost supply dramatically and help to rebuild the shattered construction sector, while tougher regulation of the rental market could ease the pain for those unable to afford their own home. And taxing housing more heavily \u2013 whether through a more progressive council tax system, heftier inheritance levies or a land value tax, under which homeowners would pay a small percentage of the value of their property each year \u2013 could help to prevent the next bubble inflating. Instead, the government appears intent on subsidising it.",

Industrial output is still 10% below its pre-crisis peak.</p> <p>Yet far from acting to redress the balance, the coalition's latest policies read like a desperate attempt to return to the unstable, unsustainable norms of the early noughties.</p> <p>Help to Buy, announced in the budget, will offer taxpayer backing for up to \u00a3130bn worth of mortgage lending, while last week's extension of the Funding for Lending scheme will allow banks to receive \u00a310 of cheap funding for every pound they lend to small businesses in 2013 \u2013 and lend it back out again in any way they like, including to buy-to-let investors.</p> <p>Back in 2002, George wanted to reassure consumers they would not face a runup in interest rates \u2013 because with other sources of growth, such as industry and exports, struggling, the Bank was willing to allow Britain's shoppers to continue propping up demand with their buy now, pay later spending habits rather than risk economic stagnation.</p> <p>When he spoke, the cost of the average home was less than \u00a396,000, though prices were already rising at double-digit rates; by the peak of the boom, little more than five years later, it had all but doubled, to \u00a3183,959.</p> <p>Alongside that extraordinary growth in house prices came an unprecedented explosion in household debt. But constantly rising prices bred a warm feeling of confidence among homeowners and fuelled a sense of entitlement to the unearned benefits of rampant housing-market inflation, creating a ready-made lobby group opposing changes to inheritance tax, council tax or any other method of sharing the windfall more widely.</p> <p>In Osborne's first, \"emergency\", budget in 2010, he carefully laid out his intention of building a safer, more stable economy, less reliant on debt-fuelled spending. Yet three years on, scarred by the failure of the pound's 20% depreciation to spark an industrial renaissance, he appears to be banking on the two-speed doctrine to lift him clear of trouble.</p> <p>Osborne has insisted that Help to Buy is not aimed at pushing up prices. But encouraging first-time buyers to take out mortgages with high loan-to-value ratios \u2013 on properties whose value may be unsustainable even at current levels, let alone after another market bounce \u2013 is hardly a recipe for a fairer or more stable economy.</p> <p>The Treasury claims to hope the policy will stimulate housebuilding, helping to ease the chronic shortage of homes that has driven up prices; but as the Treasury select committee rightly pointed out in its <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/treasury-committee/news/treasury-committee-publishes-report-on-the-budget-2013/\" title=\"\">report</a> on the budget, if the government really wanted to kickstart building, it should act to do so directly. That might mean taking advantage of record low gilt yields to invest in council housing, for example. But as Pete Jefferys of Shelter put it <a href=\"http://blog.shelter.org.uk/2013/04/flat-liners-housing-and-growth/\" title=\"\">in a blog </a>last week, Help to Buy is a \"Thatcher-style home ownership revolution, not a Macmillan-style housebuilding boom\".</p> <p>Neither does pumping out a new generation of cut-price loans \u2013 which, remember, will be available to anyone buying a house worth up to \u00a3600,000 \u2013 tackle the problem of banks still saddled with shaky-looking mortgages from the boom years. It just postpones the reckoning \u2013 and risks making it worse when it comes.</p> <p>There is agreement across the political spectrum that Britain faces a housing crisis: a generation of young people have little or no prospect of affording a place to live, and find themselves trapped in insecure, poor-quality rental housing owned by landlords out to make a quick buck.</p> <p>But first-time buyers need cheaper homes, not bigger loans, and the chancellor's argument is reminiscent of those who used to claim vehemently in the mid-noughties that allowing low-paid workers to borrow six times their income was socially necessary, because otherwise young people wouldn't be able to afford a home.</p> <p>A mass programme of publicly funded housebuilding, along the lines stirringly recreated in Ken Loach's documentary <a href=\"http://www.thespiritof45.com/\" title=\"\"><em>The Spirit of '45</em></a>, could boost supply dramatically and help to rebuild the shattered construction sector, while tougher regulation of the rental market could ease the pain for those unable to afford their own home.</p> <p>And taxing housing more heavily \u2013 whether through a more progressive council tax system, heftier inheritance levies or a land value tax, under which homeowners would pay a small percentage of the value of their property each year \u2013 could help to prevent the next bubble inflating. Instead, the government appears intent on subsidising it.</p>",

Repeating the PM's remark about \"blood, toil, tears and sweat\", King said: \"We do not face the challenges faced by Churchill's generation. But we have our own. And the spirit of those words remains as relevant today as it was to my parents' generation, who fought for the survival of our country \u2026 under Churchill's leadership.\" The governor might have been hoping to imply that he, like Churchill, had been a great leader in a time of turmoil. Yet he might be wise to be wary of too close a comparison: Churchill spent much of the 1930s warning of the storm gathering over Europe and fighting for increases in the defence budget; King spent the runup to the Great Recession ignoring the housing bubble and downgrading the Bank's financial stability arm.",
