      "bodyText": "Iceland has become the first major retailer to commit to eliminate plastic packaging for all its own-brand products. The supermarket chain, which specialises in frozen food, said it would go plastic-free within five years to help end the \u201cscourge\u201d of plastic pollution. The current plastic packaging would be replaced with paper and pulp trays and paper bags, which would be recyclable through domestic waste collections or in-store recycling facilities. The supermarket recently carried out a survey in which 80% of 5,000 people polled said they would endorse the move to go plastic-free. Iceland managing director, Richard Walker, said: \u201cThe world has woken up to the scourge of plastics. A truckload is entering our oceans every minute, causing untold damage to our marine environment and ultimately humanity \u2013 since we all depend on the oceans for our survival. \u201cThe onus is on retailers, as leading contributors to plastic packaging pollution and waste, to take a stand and deliver meaningful change.\u201d He also said Iceland would ensure all packaging was fully recyclable and would be recycled, through support for initiatives such as a bottle deposit return scheme for plastic bottles. As it was technologically and practically possible to create less environmentally harmful alternatives, \u201cthere really is no excuse any more for excessive packaging that creates needless waste and damages our environment\u201d, Walker added. Iceland has already removed plastic disposable straws from its own label range and new food ranges in the next few months will use paper-based food trays. The move, which has been welcomed by environmental campaigners, comes amid growing concern over plastic pollution in the world\u2019s oceans, where it can harm and kill wildlife such as turtles and seabirds. Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven, called the announcement a \u201cbold pledge\u201d and that it was \u201cnow up to other retailers and food producers to respond to that challenge\u201d. Last week, Theresa May pledged to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste within 25 years as part of the government\u2019s environmental strategy. The prime minister promised to extend the successful 5p levy on plastic bags to smaller shops, as well as exploring a potential charge on single-use plastic containers such as takeaway boxes. Other initiatives include a plan to urge supermarkets to introduce aisles without any plastic packaging, where all food is sold loose, along with new research funding for \u201cplastics innovation\u201d and aid to help developing nations deal with their plastic waste. Samantha Harding, from the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: \u201cIceland are steadfastly laying the path that all supermarkets should be following. \u201cAlongside its support for a deposit return system, Iceland\u2019s commitment to go plastic-free by 2023 shows that powerful retailers can take decisive action to provide what their customers want, without the environment paying for it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Finally, some 16 hours after Carillion went into liquidation, here are the other front pages: That\u2019s all for tonight. Good night! GW The Times says taxpayers could be on the hook for significant losses: Tuesday\u2019s Guardian also leads on Carillion: Here\u2019s tomorrow\u2019s FT: Time for a recap.... so here\u2019s our latest news story on Carillion, by Rob Davies and Dan Sabbagh: Thousands of staff who worked for the collapsed construction firm Carillioninside private-sector companies will have their wages stopped on Wednesday unless their jobs are rescued by other firms, the government has said. Experts also said up to 30,000 small firms are owed money by Carillion, which crashed into liquidation on Monday morning, with insolvency practitioners reporting an immediate spike in calls from worried business owners. Ministers were holding an emergency meeting on Monday night in an effort to limit the damage caused by the collapse of the the sprawling construction and support services business. As the fallout spread, the Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, faced mounting pressure over the government\u2019s oversight of the firm\u2019s increasingly precarious finances in the months leading up to its failure. Lidington told parliament the government would continue to pay those among Carillion\u2019s 19,500 UK staff who work in public sector jobs, such as NHS cleaners and school catering. But he admitted thousands of Carillion\u2019s private sector workers \u2013 who perform jobs ranging from cleaning to catering, security and postroom services to organisations such as Nationwide building society and BT Openreach \u2013 would be cut loose after 48 hours. \u201cThe position of private sector employees is that they will not be getting the same protection that we\u2019re offering to public sector employees, beyond a 48-hour period of grace,\u201d Lidington said..... I\u2019ll try to pop back later when tomorrow\u2019s front pages hit the digital newsstands..... The Daily Mail is focused on the news the Official Receiver will probe Carillion\u2019s bosses pay. It has singled out several examples of \u2018fat cat\u2019 remunerations, including: Richard Howson, who headed the company from 2012 until July 2017, pocketed \u00a31.5 million in 2016 - including a \u00a3122,612 cash bonus and \u00a3231,000 in pension contributions. As part of his departure deal, Carillion agreed to continue paying him a \u00a3660,000 salary and \u00a328,000 in benefits until October - even though he left the company for good last autumn after a brief spell as an adviser. Former finance chief Zafar Khan, who left Carillion in September, will receive \u00a3425,000 in base salary for 12 months. And Interim chief executive Keith Cochrane will be paid his \u00a3750,000 salary until July, despite leaving the company in February. He was not at the company when the rules governing bonuses were relaxed. More here. The Daily Telegraph is reporting that Carillion owes around \u00a31bn to around 30,000 UK firms, which would put \u201cthousands of jobs and pensions at risk\u201d. More here. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s punchy attack on Public Finance Initiative contracts will intensify the pressure on government ministers to get a firm grip on the Carillion situation. Especially as thousands of smaller companies are still grappling with the consequences of the biggest, and most disruptive, UK corporate failure in years. The Financial Times says that recriminations are already flying, as experts predict serious repercussions: \u201cThe fallout from this could be horrendous,\u201d said Rudi Klein, chief executive of the Specialist Engineering Contractors\u2019 Group. \u201cThe domino reverberations as it travels down the supply chain could be unprecedented.\u201d There are alarming signs tonight that some Carillion contractors may already be cutting staff. My colleague Simon Goodley explains: A worker on the new Midland Metropolitan hospital building told the BBC: \u201cEveryone on the site got told: \u2018That\u2019s it, go home\u2019. My company said, \u2018You\u2019ve been laid off\u2019.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve literally locked the gate. They\u2019ve told us we can get our personal tools off the site if they\u2019re small, but that\u2019s it.\u201d More here: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is calling for fundamental changes in the way public services are delivered in the UK, following the liquidation of Carillion. In a video message, Corbyn vowed to end the \u201cPFI rip-off\u201d, end the dogma that \u201cprivate-profit-is-best\u201d and run Britain\u2019s public services \u201cfor the benefit of the many, not the profits of the few\u201d. The Opposition leader says: In the wake of the collapse of the contractor Carillion, it is time to put an end to the rip-off privatisation policies that have done serious damage to our public services and fleeced the public of billions of pounds. This is a watershed moment. In the two-minute statement, Corbyn cites the \u201c\u00a32bn public bailout of Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin and Stagecoach for their own failure to run East Coast rail properly\u201d, as further proof that outsourcing is a flawed model. He continues: \u201cStaff and patients in our NHS are facing shocking conditions this winter. Tory underfunding has caused the crisis, but privatisation, outsourced contracts and profiteering has made it worse. \u201cOur public services \u2013 health, rail, prisons, even our Armed Forces\u2019 housing \u2013 are struggling after years of austerity and private contractors siphoning off profits from the public purse. \u201cIt\u2019s time we took back control. We not only need to guarantee the public sector takes over the work Carillion was contracted to do \u2013 but go much further and end contracts where costs spiral, profits soar and services are hollowed out. Over in the House of Lords, a former Conservative chancellor has backed calls for an inquiry into Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contracts in the aftermath of Carillion\u2019s demise. Lord Lawson told fellow peers he \u201crefused to have anything to do with it [PFI]\u201d when in office in the 1980s even though Treasury officials were keen on it. PA has more details: Subsequent chancellors, especially Labour\u2019s Gordon Brown, were \u201centhusiastically in favour of it\u201d, Lawson continued, because it enabled ministers in the short term to \u201cdress up\u201d considerable amounts of public expenditure off the public sector balance sheet. He said this was not a good reason for something which did not give good value for money for the taxpayer and introduced \u201ca degree of moral hazard which we see very much in the Carillion affair\u201d. Lord Lawson said it was important to \u201ctake stock and decide whether the whole PFI initiative should be proceeded with any further\u201d because there was enough evidence to show it was not good value for money or sensible for the taxpayer. Education minister Nick Gibb is also attending the ministerial meeting - understandably, as Carillion provides services, such as meals, to 230 schools. We\u2019re expecting to hear details of the meeting later this evening. Over in Whitehall, government ministers are discussing the Carillion crisis at the Cabinet Office. Chancellor Philip Hammond is there. As he arrived, journalists asked whether taxpayers could suffer losses from the company\u2019s collapse, but he didn\u2019t answer. The Press Association focuses on the news that Carillion\u2019s top executives are being investigated over their conduct (as covered earlier in this blog).... Here\u2019s a flavour: CARILLION BOSSES TO BE INVESTIGATED OVER COMPANY\u2019S COLLAPSE Top bosses at Carillion are to be investigated after the construction firm\u2019s collapse put thousands of jobs at risk and saw the Government heavily criticised for its role in the debacle. A last ditch plea from Carillion to the Government to provide it with a 20 million lifeline fell on deaf ears over the weekend, triggering a compulsory liquidation to be overseen by PwC. Carillion has public sector or public/private partnership contracts worth \u00a31.7bn, including providing school dinners, cleaning and catering at NHS hospitals, construction work on rail projects such as HS2 and maintaining 50,000 army base homes for the Ministry of Defence. But it has seen its shares price plunge more than 70% in the past six months after issuing a string of profit warnings and breaching its financial covenants. The group, which employs around 20,000 British workers, has been struggling under \u00a3900m of debt and a \u00a3587m pension deficit. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, told Parliament on Monday afternoon that the Official Receiver will now investigate the role of the company\u2019s former and current directors in its collapse, warning they could face \u201csevere penalties\u201d. Government minister Oliver Dowden has told Channel 4 News that Carillion staff should keep clocking on, despite the huge uncertainty over their future. Carillion\u2019s lurch into liquidation shows \u201cthe consequences of corporate greed\u201d, says the Guardian\u2019s editorial tonight. Solving this culture requires short-term, and long-term, answers, we say. The immediate steps are obvious: a full investigation into the liquidation (City regulators have questions too). But Carillion\u2019s failure is much more than that. It is the collapse of an idea that has held for 30 years. Outsourcing public sector contracts wasn\u2019t just a doctrinaire response to high levels of borrowing. It was also because Whitehall was not very good at it. That makes wholesale renationalisation, not least in a Whitehall stretched to breaking point by Brexit, extremely unlikely. This is a crisis that has been looming for years. There is no simple fix. But encouraging more, smaller businesses to secure contracts, better corporate behaviour and perhaps a single outsourcing regulator will all be part of an answer. The Guardian view on Carillion: reaping the consequences of corporate greed Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, has lambasted Carillion\u2019s management for not doing a more competent job: Responsibility for Carillion\u2019s collapse lies in the boardroom. It is the job of the directors to manage risk and the eight pages of Carillion\u2019s last annual report devoted to the subject clearly only scratched the surface. Chairman Philip Green should have spent less time wondering about the long-terms risks from Brexit and more time addressing the upfront and present dangers from cost over-runs on three big jobs: new hospitals in Liverpool and Smethwick plus the Aberdeen bypass. The walk-on role played the auditors, KPMG, will go under the Financial Reporting Council\u2019s microscope in due course. But the hard fact is that Carillion directors were boasting in March last year of having \u201csubstantial liquidity with some \u00a31.5bn of available funding\u201d yet the company ran out of money 10 months later. That suggests delusion in the boardroom on a grand scale. Hedge funds, looking from outside and betting on the shares going south, seem to have had a better grasp of Carillion\u2019s financial distress than the insiders.... More here: If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 latest story about the Carillion crisis. Britain will pay Carillion\u2019s private sector workers for 48 hours: minister Britain will pay Carillion workers on private sector contracts for 48 hours after the infrastructure firm\u2019s collapse but will not offer them the same protection as those in the public sector, the minister handling the liquidation said on Monday. The government is paying the salaries of Carillion\u2019s workers after it collapsed on Monday, but Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said that those private companies employing Carillion would have only two days of government support. \u201cThe position of private sector employees is that they will not be getting the same protection that we\u2019re offering to public sector employees, beyond a 48-hour period of grace,\u201d Lidington told lawmakers in parliament. He said the move would \u201cgive time for the private sector counterparties to Carillion to decide whether they want to accept termination of those contracts, or themselves to pay for the ongoing costs.\u201d He added: \u201cI think that is a reasonable gesture towards private sector employees.\u201d This must have been a very rough day for Carillion\u2019s 45,000 workers, including around 20,000 in the UK. Work has continued at some sites, as these photos show: I\u2019m afraid I missed Labour MP Chi Onwurah\u2019s question to David Lidington; fortunately she\u2019s just tweeted a clip: It\u2019s official: Carillion haven\u2019t cut any staff today. That\u2019s the end of David Lidington\u2019s lengthy statement on Carillion. Here are the key points: The government has promised that Carillion\u2019s public sector contracts will continue to operate, under the Official Receiver\u2019s control, following this morning\u2019s liquidation. But private sector contracts - which make up 60% of Carillion\u2019s business are only guaranteed for 48 hours. After that, they could be terminated unless Carillion\u2019s customers (perhaps a bank or a telecoms firm) agrees to keep making its payments, and cover any additional costs run up by the Receiver. Lidington told MPs that the Receiver would examine the conduct of Carillion\u2019s current and past directors. They could be sanctioned if they have acted badly. This may include the company\u2019s controversial changes to its bonus rules, which make it harder to claw back payments to top bosses. However, he did not promise to stop paying former CEO Richard Howson; he is receiving 12 months pay since his exit last autumn. His opposite number, Labour\u2019s Jon Trickett, said the government had been dangerously complacent, and missed several warning signs from Carillion. Several Labour MPs argued that Carillion\u2019s failure showed the folly of handing public sector work to private companies; especially under PFI deals that are meant to protect the taxpayer. But Lidington insisted that Carillion isn\u2019t being bailed out, as its creditors and shareholders have been hit. Opposition MPs also called for a windfall tax on PFI operators, given Carillion has banked almost \u00a31bn of PFI profits in recent years. Conservative MPs pushed the government to rethink its HS2 rail link, which will whizz swiftly, and unpopularly, through several leafy Tory constituencies. Lidington, though, says the project will continue - other companies will pick up Carillion\u2019s work. Carillion is the most \u2018appalling epitome of lemon socialism\u2019, says Labour\u2019s Paul Sweeney, as a failing company is being propped up. Lidington firmly denies it, saying that Carillion\u2019s creditors and shareholders have suffered financial losses. Matt Western, Labour MP, says that Carillion was the most shorted stock on the London stock market in 2016 (meaning hedge funds were betting against it). Why didn\u2019t the government take notice? Was there a blind spot? Lidington denies that the government was blind to Carillion\u2019s challenges. That\u2019s why they created joint ventures, so that other private sector companies would step in if Carillion failed. Here\u2019s a clip of Rachel Reeves\u2019 question: Diana Johnson MP says the \u2018reward for failure\u2019 at Carillion show that the government should crack down on executive pay. David Lidington reiterates that the Official Receiver can take action against any directors who have acted unacceptably. Labour MP Toby Perkins asks why the government allowed its \u2018crown representative\u2019 at Carillion to lapse this summer [as revealed earlier], just as the company filed its first profits warning. Lidington says a new Crown Representative has been appointed, and will be named soon (isn\u2019t it a bit late now?!). Labour\u2019s Kate Green asks if Carillion has been hit with penalties over its poor management of the prison service contract? (all those broken windows at Wandsworth....) Lidington says he\u2019ll ask the Justice department. Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock says Carillion is a \u2018sorry tale of the privatisation of profit and the nationalisation of risk\u2019. Q: Isn\u2019t the case for a windfall tax on these companies now unanswerable? David Lidington denies this; Carillion isn\u2019t being bailed out, and the risk remains with the private sector. Conservative MP Robert Coutts asks the government to guarantee that Oxford\u2019s John Radcliffe hospital* won\u2019t be hurt by Carillion\u2019s collapse [Carillion has provided services at the JR since 2005] Lidington says there is not sign that the JR has been affected by Carillion\u2019s problems. Lidington denies that he is just providing a helpline - we are also guaranteeing that public sector contracts will continue. Lidington denies that Carillion\u2019s demise reflects badly on the UK, saying that \u201cthere are few countries where companies don\u2019t fail\u201d. Carillion\u2019s collapse is a welcome reminder that \u201cCapitalism without bankruptcy is like Christianity without hell,\u201d says Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen. \u201cWithout it - there\u2019s nothing to keep us on the straight and narrow.\u201d Lidington won\u2019t be lured into a theological debate, but agrees that the work contracted to Carillion should continue. Does the government\u2019s protection of Carillion\u2019s public sector contracts include new commitments, or might early-stage projects be ditched, asks Labour\u2019s Louise Haigh. Lidington says the Official Receiver, and government departments, must examine each contract to see how to take them best forward. Kevan Jones MP asks about Carillion\u2019s habit of not paying suppliers for several weeks (120 days in some cases, apparently) Q: What will the government do to help them? Lidington says suppliers who have not been paid now become official creditors. And he suggests that the government will not bail out these companies -- taxpayers\u2019 money should be used to protect public services. How many profit warnings does a company have to issue before this government decides not to hand it any more business, asks Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Lloyd. Lidington replies that profit warnings happen from time to time; shunning a company on this basis would only push it into deeper problems. Conservative MP Kevin Foster asks what protections are being provided for Carillion pensioners. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington says the Official Receiver must examine 12 separate pension funds. But the bottom line is that all existing pensioners will be protected. Labour\u2019s Liz McInnes asks if the Carillion crisis will exacerbate the NHS\u2019s winter crisis. Lidington says (again) that contingency plans are in place to protect health services. Conservative MP Bob Neill asks how Carillion\u2019s prison contracts will keep operating. Lidington says the government has contingency plans - a new government company could be created to take over this work. Sam Coates of The Times is stuck by the government\u2019s warning that Carillion\u2019s private sector contracts could be terminated on Wednesday, unless customers commit to keep paying up. Former infrastructure tsar Lord Adonis isn\u2019t impressed by Lidington\u2019s comments: This is from The Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes: Another Labour MP, Pat McFadden, asks about the new \u2018jobcentre plus\u2019 helpline which the government has set up today. Q: Doesn\u2019t that undermine his promise that they will keep being paid if they turn up to work? Lidington says that all Carillion workers are protected for the next 48 hours, even those employed on contracts with the private sector [which is three-fifths of Carillion\u2019s business]. But after 48 hours, either the private sector counter-party must agree to fund future provision including the fees of the Official Receiver, or those private sector contracts of Carillion will be terminated. The new Jobcentre Plus helpline is meant to help those people in particular, Lidington adds. [Reminder: workers on public sector contracts have greater protection; the Receiver will keep operating those contracts] Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy says Carillion has made nearly \u00a31bn profit on PFI contracts over the last four years. Will the government now bring in a windfall tax on PFI profits? Cabinet Office minister David Lidington replies that PFI has provided \u00a360bn of capital to improve public services. PFI is not an \u2018easy ticket for riches\u2019 for contractors, he insists. In this case, the shareholders and creditors of Carillion are suffering very significant losses. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn asks David Lidington to confirm that all payments made to Carillion under PFI contracts from councils will now cease, and that the Official Receiver will not be allowed to sell these contracts on. Lidington says he isn\u2019t aware of any PFI contracts facing an immediate crisis; but the future of all Carillion contracts depends on finding fresh suppliers to take them on. Conservative MP Sir Desmond Swayne asks whether government officials are capable of spotting when a company is pitching its services too cheaply. Lidington says there should be a \u2018fresh look\u2019 into how the government handles such issues. Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves points out that Carillion kept paying dividends to shareholders, even as it ran up \u00a3900m of debts and a \u00a3580m pensions black hole. And it is still paying \u00a3600,000 to its ex-CEO (Richard Howson) Q: Can you confirm that those payments to Carillion\u2019s CEO end today? Lidington repeats that the Official Receiver will examine whether directors have acted properly (which I think means that Howson\u2019s payments continue for the moment...) Echoing Bill Cash\u2019s comments, Conservative MP Dame Cheryl Gillan says that Carillion\u2019s demise is a great opportunity to cancel HS2. Lidington reiterates that Carillion\u2019s liquidation doesn\u2019t affect the construction of HS2. Labour MP Emma Reynolds asks Lidington about the revelation that Carillion changed its bonus rules, to make it harder to claw money back from bosses. Lidington says he mustn\u2019t pre-empt the Official Receiver\u2019s probe into the conduct of past and present directors. But he emphasises that the Receiver can impose \u2018severe\u2019 penalties if there has been misconduct. Tory MP Bill Cash asks about the impact on High-Speed Two . Does Carillion\u2019s collapse affect the viability of the project? Lidington says HS2 will continue as planned, as the two other private sector parties will take over Carillion\u2019s responsibilities (that\u2019s Kier, and French civil engineering group Eiffage). Labour MP Eleanor Smith says the liquidation of Carillion hit workers like a bomb today (the company\u2019s HQ is in her Wolverhampton constituency). What support will the government provide? What future can ministers provide? Lidington agrees to meet with her to discuss what support can be provided to the company\u2019s staff. Conservative MP Iain Duncan-Smith congratulates David Lidington on his \u2018swift action\u2019 over Carillion. He says Labour drove the move towards outsourcing public services (during the Blair-Brown years). Lidington replies that his immediate priority is focusing on the continuity of public services, but eventually ministers should look at the wider issue of outsourcing. The SNP\u2019s Tommy Sheppard asks what will happen to Carillion\u2019s contracts in Scotland. He also asks what due diligence was carried out by the government, given it handed Carillion \u00a32bn of contracts in recent months. Q: Was it incompetence or ideology that led to ministers signing off multi-million pound contracts to a company that was going bust? David Lidington assures Sheppard that the government will continue to pay the salaries and bills owed by Carillion in Scotland, as in the rest of the UK. Some contracts will be transferred to other suppliers, he suggests, while others could be taken in-house by the government. David Lidington says that Carillion only held contracts with 230 UK schools. He confirms that 60% of Carillion\u2019s revenue comes from private sector contracts. There is currently a 48-hour \u2018grace period\u2019 while customers decide whether to maintain those contracts or look elsewhere. Workers on the 40% of public sector accounts will continue to be paid by the Official Receiver, Lidington confirms. Lidington also takes a swipe at Trickett for his argument that Carillion\u2019s contracts should be taken in house. One third of Carillion\u2019s contracts were awarded by the Conservative government, one third were awarded by the last coalition government (2010-2015) and a third were awarded under the previous Labour government. Jon Trickett asks David Lidington to reassure the House of Commons that Carillion isn\u2019t the first in a series of dominos, and accuses the government of being \u2018too cosy\u2019 with Carillion management. Labour\u2019s Jon Trickett is responding to David Lidington. He says Lidington\u2019s statement was \u2018recklessly complacent\u2019 in trying to avoid taking responsibility for the collapse of Carillion, which held 450 government contracts. Trickett is also alarmed that Lidington mentioned the support available from Job Centre plus - that will send a shudder of fear through its 20,000 UK workforce. He asks Lidington to confirm that Carillion provided services at 50 prisons, 9000 schools, 200 operating theatres and 11,800 hospital beds. 40% of Carillion\u2019s income is derived from UK, Trickett says. And if the government was really watching Carillion closely, as it claims, why did it allow the crucial role of Crown Representative of Carillion to lapse for three months? Lidington says that the private sector plays an important role delivering UK public services - something that parties on both sides of the House of Commons have accepted. Lidington say the government\u2019s role is to plan and prepare contingency measures for Carillion. Its \u2018top priority\u2019 is to keep public services running, so the government will support the Official Receiver to deliver uninterrupted services. The Receiver is under a duty to report any improper conduct by officials, Lidington says. The investigation will look at the conduct of directors at the point of insolvency, and also the actions of previous directors. They will also consider whether any actions from directors has hurt the company\u2019s pension scheme. Lidington also insists that the government has been watching Carillion closely since its first profit warning last July - triggering some critical noises from the opposition benches. Cabinet office minister David Lidington is delivering a statement on the Carillion crisis to MPs now. He says the failure of Carillion is regrettable, but it is the failure of a private sector company. Its shareholders and lenders should bear the brunt of the cost. Taxpayers should not and will not bail out a private sector company for private sector losses, Lidington insists (how thing have changed since the financial crisis in 2008!). Breaking away from parliament, Britain\u2019s prison officers are urging the government to take Carillion\u2019s contract for prison maintenance back into public hands. Steve Gillan, general secretary of the POA trade union, says facilities have deteriorated on Carillion\u2019s watch. We need to know the contingency plans to keep our prisons operational. During the time Carillion had this contract the level of essential maintenance and work that is outstanding has spiraled out of control. This has resulted in loss of prison accommodation and in-humane conditions in our prisons. My colleague Amelia Gentleman warned last year that Wandsworth prison wasn\u2019t keeping up to speed with repairs: Britain\u2019s top civil servant, cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, admits that Carillion has gone badly wrong. John Manzoni tells the PAC committee that he hopes that \u201cmost\u201d of the jobs and pensions at Carillion will be preserved. That\u2019s effectively an admission that some won\u2019t be.... The Public Accounts Committee is uncovering some intriguing detail into the Carillion breakdown, as it quizzes Cabinet Office head honcho John Manzoni. Manzoni has revealed that the government\u2019s Crown Representative \u2018rotated off\u2019 the Carillion account this summer - just when the company suffered its first profit warning. [explanation: a Crown Representative is a senior role, meant to help the government get a good deal from its suppliers] This meant that \u201cthe horsepower\u201d around the Carillion was provided by the strategic partnership management team, who Manzoni insists \u2018played a blinding role\u2019. The committee aren\u2019t impressed; one MP asks whether this meant they had their eyes covered. No, says Manzoni coldly. The head of this team did a very good job, he insists. But Manzoni also seems to imply that Carillion\u2019s second profits warning, two months ago, jolted the civil service: There seems to be some confusion about this crisis meeting.... The Public Accounts Committee is now quizzing the cabinet office\u2019s top civil servants about why Carillion was handed public sector contracts at a time when City hedge funds were betting against the company. Q: Why can\u2019t the government tell a company like Carillion to \u2018take a holiday\u2019 from bidding for government contracts, because they look high risk? Because it\u2019s against the law, shoots back permanent secretary John Manzoni. Q: So how can you be mitigaging risks if you are handing Carillion contracts that you don\u2019t want to? We never award contracts that we don\u2019t want to, Manzoni replies. The government always does a full review of every company involved when we award these bids. Manzoni describes Carillion\u2019s liquidation as a \u201cvery unusual\u201d move, designed to prevent a sudden breakdown in public services. We have put it to the Official Receiver with an instruction to keep public services running.... The cost of that is no greater than running these contracts in the normal course of business. But, there will be some additional costs incurred by the Official Receiver, which the taxpayer will pick up. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee is launching a new inquiry following Carillion\u2019s liquidation. The inquiry will be called \u201cSourcing public services: lessons to be learned from the collapse of Carillion\u201d. PAC committee chairman Bernard Jenkin says it will go wider than just Carillion, and will look at issues raised by the committee in previous years such as the provision of IT services. Jenkin announced the probe as his committee grills three top civil servants from the cabinet office \u2013 Sir Jeremy Heywood, Cabinet Secretary, John Manzoni, Permanent Secretary, and Rupert McNeil, Chief People Officer. Over in parliament, defence minister Gavin Williamson has revealed that the government will hold a crisis meeting later today to discuss the collapse of Carillion. During defence questions, Williamson told MPs that: We\u2019ve been monitoring this very closely, and working with our industrial partners. There will be a Cobra meeting today later on today to look at addressing some of the most immediate issues. Cobra stands for Cabinet Office briefing room A. It is an emergency council meeting which is convened when the government faces a big crisis - particularly one which involves several government departments. In Defence\u2019s case, Carillion managed 50,000 military homes in partnership with AMEY (as explained this morning). Williamson says that the government will work with AMEY to ensure that standards are driven up, and to make sure that service quality doesn\u2019t suffer. George Osborne\u2019s attempt to blame the civil service for the Carillion crisis may be backfiring, as photos of the ex-chancellor posing in Carillion-branded hard hats hit the internet. The serious point is that Osborne had a massive influence on Britain\u2019s finances for several years, and pushed on with PFI contracts after becoming chancellor. This crisis can\u2019t simply be blamed on civil servants; their job is to implement government policy. Britain\u2019s corporate governance watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council, have revealed they have been \u201cactively\u201d watching the situation at Carillion. That\u2019s may not be much comfort to Carillion\u2019s workers and clients. But it could suggest that Carillion\u2019s auditors, KPMG, will face investigation. The FRC says: We have been actively monitoring this situation for some time in close consultation with other relevant regulatory bodies. We have powers to investigate the circumstances relating to the audit of Carillion as well as the actions of the relevant accounting professionals. We are obliged to follow due process and will make a further statement on this matter shortly. Equipment firm Speedy Hire is being pummelled by City traders, sending its shares down by up to 8% today. Carillion was a major customer for Speedy Hire, which supplies tools to the construction industry. The collapse of Carillion has also caused alarm in the Republic of Ireland. Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald reports: The Irish government has been urged to act swiftly and decisively regarding five schools in Ireland that have been left in limbo over the collapse of Carillion. Main opposition party Fianna Fail has warned today that the schools are completely unsure as to what will happen their building projects which under the remit of Carillion. Fianna Fail Education spokesperson Thomas Byrne said one of the schools is in his own Meath East constituency. \u201cEureka Secondary School in Kells is due to open in a matter of weeks but as a result of the difficulties at Carillion, there is doubt as to when it might happen, and who will provide the facilities management and catering services in the school.\u201d Byrne called on the state to take over the running of the non-academic services at all five schools and then possibly tender again for the contracts after Carillion\u2019s collapse. Update: Cabinet Office minister David Lidington is expected to update MPs on the Carillion crisis at around 4.15pm. A spokesman for the RMT rail workers union said it was \u201calmost inevitable\u201d that some trains won\u2019t be cleaned today due to the collapse of Carillion. That\u2019s due to the problems with its fuel cards (see earlier post) The company employed train cleaners, who were issued with vans to get from job to job and fuel cards to pay for petrol. With the company in liquidation, those fuel cards have stopped working, making it impossible for cleaning staff to do their jobs unless they are willing to dip into their own pockets. If your train carriage on the commute home is filthy this evening, that might be why. Sam O\u2019Callaghan, solicitor in the construction, energy and projects team at Capital Law, predicts that Carillion\u2019s project portfolio will face \u201csignificant\u201d difficulties. Sub-contractors, consultants, and clients may end up losing out on money that they\u2019re contractually entitled to. Secured creditors (like banks) will be putting their hands in the insolvency pot first. Every sub-contractor, consultant, or anyone involved in a contractual chain with Carillion should take immediate action \u2013 starting by reviewing their contract, or getting their lawyer to do so.\u201d The Press Association is reporting that fuel cards issued to Carillion workers were rejected at petrol stations this morning. PA says: Train cleaners have been told to work normally, but their fuel cards are not working, according to the Rail, Maritime and Transport union. One cleaner filled up at a petrol station, but the Carillion Fuel Card bounced. The RMT said it was the start of the \u201cbrutal reality\u201d facing Carillion workers. Conrad Landin of the Morning Star has more details: Frank Field MP, Chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, has condemned Carillion for allowing its pension deficit to swell (to at least \u00a3580m). In a statement, Field says tougher rules are needed to prevent firms acting recklessly. \u201cCarillion took on mega borrowings while its pension deficit ballooned. We called over a year ago for The Pensions Regulator to have mandatory clearance powers for corporate activities like these that put pension schemes at risk, and powers to impose truly deterrent fines that would focus boardroom minds. \u201cIf Government had acted then, the brakes might have been put on Carillion\u2019s massive ramping up of debt and it never would have fallen into this sorry crisis. It seems we have a new case like this every week, and this one is particularly disastrous, with massive job losses and 28,000 current and future pensioners at risk. I would like to ask the Government today: what more is it going to take?\u201d Carillion\u2019s collapse is good news for one group -- its rivals. Shares in outsourcing group Serco have surged by over 5% this morning, as traders predict that it will pick up some juicy contracts in the aftermath of Carillion\u2019s demise. In the long-term, the loss of Carillion could allow the rest of the sector to push up their prices too. Connor Campbell of Spreadex says: Of course there were plenty of vultures in the sector circling the Carillion carrion. Serco Group, which bought \u00a347.7 million in healthcare contracts from the crisis-hit company back in December, jumped 4.5%, while Capita climbed 1% and Interserve rose 2.6%. As chancellor of the exchequer between 2010 and 2016, George Osborne had a tight grip on the nation\u2019s purse strings. Now, in his new role as editor of the Evening Standard, Osborne blames the civil service for handing too many contracts to big firms like Carillion. Today\u2019s Standard editorial explains: The failure to use a variety of smaller, mid-size companies undermines innovation and leaves services hostage when things go wrong. Why was Carillion awarded huge contracts by the civil service, with whom rather than ministers almost all procurement decisions lie after they knew it was struggling last year? Above all, how we will insist \u2014 as we must \u2014 that shareholders are bailed in before the taxpayer is asked to fund any kind of bailout? We wait for answers. Back in December 2014, Osborne took a tour of a Carillion training centre in Middlesborough, where he learned how to lay bricks and hang a door. Perhaps he could offer his services to those local authorities struggling to replace Carillion today.... Peter Kitson, Partner at law firm Russell-Cooke, says Carillion may have caused its own demise by pitching its services at an uncompetitively low rate - to win business. \u201dThe procurement rules (the Public Contracts Regulations) which govern public sector procurement are central to understanding what has happened here. Almost all Carillion contracts have been competitively tendered under those procurement rules. The rules require public sector clients to investigate and possibly to exclude any tenderer whose bid is \u2018abnormally low\u2019. One contributory factor here may be that Carillion has tendered at very low margins, possibly unsustainably low, in order to win these huge volumes of work. If such bids have succeeded, that can only mean either than the Regulations themselves are ineffective or that public sector clients lack the confidence or the expertise properly to enforce those rules. Following this morning\u2019s announcement, I am sure that many of those public sector clients will be seeking advice on the extent to which those same procurement rules allow short term emergency replacement contracts to be let without formal procurement.\u201d The British Army is reassuring military families that Carillion\u2019s collapse won\u2019t hurt them: Carillion was employed by the government to manage around 50,000 homes used by armed forces personnel and their families. Carillion\u2019s collapse will have widespread consequences for local authorities and housing associations across the UK. Andrew Lancaster, partner at Anthony Collins Solicitors, says organisations may face extra costs as they scramble to find new contractors to step in. While it\u2019s likely some key public sector contracts will be ring-fenced and supported in some way by the government, local authorities and housing associations still need to provide their residents and communities with resilient public services in the coming week. This means back up contractors need to be found immediately, requiring huge amounts of time, resource and additional expenditure. \u201cI would urge such organisations to read their contracts\u2019 payment and termination clauses and, crucially, to comply with them to avoid any claims from the liquidator later on for any breach Here\u2019s my colleague Dan Sabbagh, reporting from today\u2019s House of Commons lobby briefing on Carillion: The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said that some of Carillion 450 public sector contracts could be taken in house, although that was \u201ca decision for further down the line\u201d. However, the contracts for building part of the HS2 rail link would remain in the private sector, he added. Kier and Eiffage, the other two construction partners, had given ministers assurances they could take the work to build the London to Birmingham part of the line without Carillion. He described the collapse of the company as \u201cvery regrettable\u201d and said that ministers had been monitoring the situation since the company\u2019s profits warning in July. Only a \u201csingle figure\u201d number of contracts had been let to Carillion since then, including those for the HS2 build, and in the case of joint ventures assurances had been sought in all circumstances. Number 10 added there would be no significant extra costs in servicing contracts held by the collapsed company bar paying for the expenses of the Official Receiver which has taken control of the firm. There were no plans for an official inquiry into the company\u2019s collapse beyond an already announced investigation to be held by the receiver whose job it is to \u2018investigate the cause of failure\u2019. The Institute of Directors has issued a stinging rebuke to Carillion\u2019s top executives and directors over its pay policies. Roger Barker, head of corporate governance at the IoD, is particularly alarmed that the company changed its bonus rules to protect top bosses. Today\u2019s outcome suggests that effective governance was lacking at Carillion, and we must now consider if the board and shareholders have exercised appropriate oversight prior to the collapse. \u201cThere are some worrying signs. The relaxation of clawback conditions for executive bonuses in 2016 appears in retrospect to be highly inappropriate. It does no good to the reputation of UK business when top managers appear to benefit in spite of the collapse of the organisations that they are responsible for. Those bonus changes meant that money could only be clawed back if Carillion misstated its results or if an executive committed gross misconduct. Lord Adonis - who earlier suggested Carillion could be a British Enron - says the government should consider taking its contracts back into state control. It may be best value for the government to take over public sector contracts, rather than hand them to other companies who will demand a \u201cKing\u2019s Ransom\u201d, Adonis tells Sky News. That might be an ideological switch for the Conservative government, but Adonis insists that they have a duty to protect the taxpayer. Carillion\u2019s shocking collapse should trigger a full review of the privatisation of public services in the UK, says Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins: What the Carillion saga demonstrates is the rampant indiscipline in the contracts themselves. The company\u2019s demise is attributable to favouritism, cost escalation, excessive risk, obscene remuneration and reckless indebtedness. Carillion and its bankers clearly thought it too big to fail. Whitehall behaved accordingly. It was like a pre-2008 bank. There must now be a review of how privatisation is working. Its so-called parastatal companies are not true private entities. They depend on the state, and the state depends on them. Their lobbyists develop an unholy relationship with ministers and officials \u2013 witness the uncontrolled revolving door between Whitehall and the boardrooms. Lee Causer, partner at accountancy firm Moore Stephens, predicts that Carillion\u2019s failure will have \u201chuge ramifications\u201d across the construction sector. He expects contracts to be delayed, and some suppliers to go bust. \u201cMany of Carillion\u2019s suppliers will have automatically assumed that a group the size of Carillion would be rescued. Therefore, many will not have prepared for its collapse and will struggle to get alternative contracts in place. \u201cThe failure of Carillion will inevitably lead to disruption across the supply chain, and financial turmoil for sub-contractors who relied on business from Carillion. \u201cIts collapse could trigger a number of insolvencies across the construction sector, in an industry that already experiences the highest levels of insolvency per year in the UK.\u201d Professor John Colley of Warwick Business School says Carillion was sunk by two serious mistakes: Too many contracts were taken at poor margins and terms, which prevented any subsequent profitability under competitive pressure. Some were allocated during the recession when it was win work at all costs. \u201cThe other key issue is project accounting, which tends to recognise losses late in the project, effectively when the project starts to run out of money. There will no doubt be serious retrospective scrutiny of the accounting. Sarah Beale, chief executive at the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB), fears that Carillion\u2019s apprentices could soon be out of work. She is pushing the Official Receiver to support Carillion\u2019s trainees: \u201cThe news of Carillion entering insolvency is clearly a significant blow to the UK construction sector. While this will present the sector with a number of challenges, CITB\u2019s priority is to do all it can to ensure that Carillion apprentices can continue their training so their skills are not lost. \u201cWe have established a project team to work with the apprentices and will be offering in principle grant and apprenticeship transfer incentives to our employer base in order to retain these learners. Newsflash: Theresa May\u2019s spokesman is briefing journalists about Carillion\u2019s collapse. He says it is \u2018regrettable\u2019 that Carillion couldn\u2019t find the funding required to keep operating, but taxpayers can\u2019t be expected to bail it out But he also confirms that some costs will be incurred from the liquidation, as the government will cover the costs of the Official Receiver. He says the HS2 high-speed rail project is not at risk, and will be delivered. Carillion\u2019s army of workers are suffering a \u2018terribly time\u2019 today, says UNISON general secretary Dave Prentis. \u201cStaff need assurances about whether they have a job, who will pay their wages, and what\u2019s going to happen to their pensions. \u201cThe government needs to move quickly to bring these contracts back in-house \u2013 to safeguard our services and to protect the many staff in schools, hospitals, local authorities and libraries. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that Carillion was lining the pockets of its shareholders, even though the company\u2019s future was increasingly uncertain. Prentis also fears that taxpayers will pick up the bill for the company\u2019s failure. \u201cCrucial public services have been put at risk, and the taxpayer is going to be stuck picking up the bill for yet another failed privatisation experiment. \u201cCarillion holds key contracts across the health service \u2013 with the current winter pressures, staff shortages and underfunding, further uncertainty puts the NHS in a precarious position.\u201d Last week, my colleague Aditya Chakrabortty warned that the Carillion crisis could have a major impact on the UK: This is a firm that employs just under 20,000 workers in Britain \u2013 and the same again abroad. It has a huge chain of suppliers \u2013 and its habit of going in for joint ventures with other construction businesses means that a collapse at Carillion would send shockwaves through the industry and through the government\u2019s public works programme. To see what this means, take the HS2 rail link, where Carillion this summer was part of a consortium that won a \u00a31.4bn contract to knock tunnels through the Chilterns. If Carillion goes under, what happens to the largest infrastructure project in Europe? What happens to its partners on the deal, British firm Kier, and France\u2019s Eiffage? The project will need to be put back and the taxpayer will almost certainly have to step in. The decision to put Carillion into a full-blown compulsory liquidation shows how little value was left within the company. David Birne, insolvency partner at chartered accountants H W Fisher &amp; Company, says it is \u2018extremely rare\u2019 move for a company of Carillion\u2019s size - and bad news for its staff. Birne warns: \u201cFor Carillion\u2019s 43,000 global staff, liquidation means the immediate risk of redundancy. \u201cFor Carillion it will mean huge breach of contract penalties that could dwarf anything demanded of it by creditors. \u201cAnd there will undoubtedly be a knock-on effect for companies that supply Carillion that will go all the way down the supply chain to the smallest firms. Andy Street, the former John Lewis boss who became the first mayor of the West Midlands last year, is setting up a taskforce to support employees of Carillion and subcontractors affected by the company\u2019s collapse. The taskforce will involve the Black Country chambers of commerce, city council, Local Enterprise Partnership and West Midlands combined authority. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know how many of those staff will transfer as some parts of the business hopefully are sold on,\u201d said Street. He adds: \u201cWe\u2019ll want to make sure as much cash as can be raised is raised, so that small businesses who are subcontractors are paid as much as possible and the contagion is limited. \u201cIt\u2019s good news that the Carillion contracts for public services have got a commitment that they will be secured, whether it\u2019s schools or prisons services, that\u2019s taken care of and it\u2019s right that\u2019s the first priority\u201d. Street is on his way this morning to the Midland Metropolitan hospital, a major unfinished project that was among those that went wrong for Carillion. Responding to uncertainty about its future, Street said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know the contractual arrangements but we\u2019ll be pressing, given how critical it is to the West Midlands. We\u2019ll be looking for a new contractor so it continues to be built.\u201d Construction firm Galliford Try has issued a statement.... revealing that it also faces a financial hit from Carillion\u2019s demise. Galliford says: The Group is in joint venture with Carillion and Balfour Beatty on the \u00a3550m Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route contract. The terms of the contract are such that the remaining joint venture members, Balfour Beatty and Galliford Try, are obliged to complete the contract. Our current estimate of the additional cash contribution outstanding from Carillion to complete the project is \u00a360-80 million, of which any shortfall will be funded equally between the joint venture members. Galliford\u2019s shares are down by almost 4% this morning, at the bottom of the FTSE 250. Balfour Beatty are down 2.3%, after revealing it faces a hit of \u00a335m to \u00a345m. Just in: Cabinet Office minister David Lidington will give a statement to the House of Commons later today on the collapse of Carillion. Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm, Menzies LLP, also fears that small firms employed by Carillion could now collapse. Underwood expects Carillion\u2019s operations to keep running, probably propped up by government cash (ie, the taxpayer). But the liquidation could be \u2018long and messy\u2019, which could drag small firms under. Underwood says: \u201cCarillion\u2019s liquidation will have a significant impact on its many thousands of employees and on the company\u2019s supply chain, which is likely to comprise a large number of UK-based sub-contractors..... \u201cGiven that the company has now gone into liquidation, sub-contractors and suppliers could experience financial difficulties as a direct result of Carillion\u2019s demise; potentially leading to knock-on insolvencies. If affected in this way, suppliers and sub-contractors should seek professional advice immediately. Underwood adds that small businesses affected have some options: It may be possible to ease the cashflow burden by helping them to agree \u2018Time to Pay\u2019 arrangements with HMRC and possibly renegotiate terms with their own suppliers, either informally, or through a rescue process like a Voluntary Arrangement.\u201d My colleague Rob Davies is investigating how Britain\u2019s construction industry is responding to Carillion\u2019s collapse.... Former pensions minister Steve Webb is concerned that Carillion has been lavishing its shareholders with dividend payments, rather than tackling its pension deficit. Infrastructure business Amey Group says it will take over the delivery of housing service for Britain\u2019s military. Amey had been managing these contracts in a joint venture with Carillion, but is now taking up the job alone. It says: Amey has incorporated joint ventures with Carillion to deliver the Regional Prime and National Housing contracts for the Ministry of Defence (MOD), through the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO). These contracts maintain the MOD estate in the UK. The terms of the joint ventures\u2019 arrangements mean that Amey will continue the services now that Carillion has announced it is entering into immediate compulsory liquidation. Amey is committed to doing this and ensuring continuity of service to the DIO and MOD and the service men and women in the UK. Labour MP Matthew Pennycook says Amey must ensure that military families don\u2019t suffer from Carillion\u2019s demise. Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the influential Public Accounts Committee, fears that taxpayers face a \u2018raw deal\u2019 from the Carillion collapse: Hillier says (via the Press Association): Carillion\u2019s collapse raises grave concerns about jobs, the delivery of public services and the way Government conducts its business. \u201cThe Public Accounts Committee has previously warned of the risks when contractors, paid from the public purse, become too big to fail. \u201cGovernment now faces a stark choice: bail Carillion out or let public services and projects suffer. Either way, taxpayers will get a raw deal. \u201cGovernment has serious questions to answer about its role in allowing taxpayers\u2019 exposure to escalate to this point.\u201d Carillion workers face a 10% cut to their pensions, because the company\u2019s pension scheme is currently in deficit to the tune of \u00a3580m. This pension scheme is likely to be taken over by the Pension Protection Fund. That would guarantee the pensions of those who have already retired, but would also cost current workers at least 10% of their final deal. Tom McPhail of investment service Hargreaves Lansdown explains: \u201cWhilst the PPF provides valuable security, members who have not yet reached retirement should be prepared for a cut to their pension pay outs. This will involve an immediate cut of 10%, plus the possible loss of some inflation proofing; higher earners may be affected by the PPF cap on payouts which currently stands at \u00a334,655.05. An upward adjustment to the cap applies to those members with 20 or more years\u2019 service. Members who have already reached normal retirement age should continue to enjoy 100% of their current pension payments. McPhail adds that resolving Carillion\u2019s pension scheme could take \u201cmonths or even years\u201d. Newsflash: Construction firm Balfour Beatty says Carillion\u2019s collapse will cost it up to \u00a345m. In a statement to the City, it says: Balfour Beatty is in Joint Venture with Carillion on three projects: the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route, the A14 in Cambridgeshire and the M60 Junction 8 to M62 Junction 20 scheme. Balfour Beatty will continue to work with its customers and will meet its contractual commitments. The cash impact to Balfour Beatty is likely to be an outflow in the range of \u00a335m to \u00a345m in 2018. However, rival construction firm Keir Group says it doesn\u2019t expect to suffer a financial hit, even though it works with Carillion on the High Speed 2 project and the Highways England smart motorways programme. Keir says: We have put in place contingency plans for each of these projects and are working closely with clients so as to achieve continuity of service. Following today\u2019s announcement and after a short period of transition for these contracts, we do not expect there to be an adverse financial impact on the Group arising from these joint venture contracts. Carillion\u2019s former CEO could soon be summoned to parliament to explain what went wrong... Accountancy firm PwC has issued a statement, confirming that the High Court has appointed the Official Receiver as liquidator for Carillion. Six senior PwC executives will act as \u2018special managers\u2019 to assist in the operation. PwC says staff affected should keep working while the situation unfolds: The Official Receiver\u2019s priority is to ensure the continuity of public services while securing the best outcome for creditors. Unless told otherwise, all employees, agents and subcontractors are being asked to continue to work as normal and they will be paid for the work they do during the liquidations. They also confirm that Carillion\u2019s investors have been wiped out: Unfortunately, as a result of the liquidation appointments, there is no prospect of any return to shareholders. The government has set up an advice page on the Carillion crisis: Carillion declares insolvency: information for employees, creditors and suppliers Train drivers\u2019 union ASLEF has added its voice to the chorus of calls for a public inquiry. Mick Whelan, general secretary of ASLEF, says: \u2018Naturally, we are thinking of all the workers, in the public and private sectors, who have been impacted by the construction company Carillion going into administration today. \u2018We do wonder, though, how and why, after serial profits warnings, contracts came to be awarded to Carillion, particularly in the rail sector by Chris Grayling, and the impact this may have on the future of Crossrail and HS2. \u2018We echo the request from Rebecca Long-Bailey to bring all public sector contracts back under public control immediately. \u2018And there needs to be an urgent public inquiry into all aspects of this and a recognition that PFI does not work for the taxpayer, the consumer, or the good of this country.\u2019 Carillion\u2019s former boss, Richard Howson, is under fire this morning. Howson stepped down as Carillion\u2019s CEO last July when it issued a shock profits warning. But he didn\u2019t formally leave the firm until last autumn - and is receiving 12 months pay -- a \u00a3660,000 salary and \u00a328,000 benefits. Vince Cable MP, leader of the Liberal Democrats, says Howson\u2019s payoff is an unacceptable \u2018reward for failure\u2019: \u201cWe urgently need a parliamentary inquiry into some of the very questionable decisions made in the past few months, not least the award of public contracts to a company that was clearly in danger of collapse. The issue of the former chief executive still being paid his salary, plus perks and bonus, is also a reward for failure that has to be looked into.\u201d Independent columnist Shehad Khan agrees: The Federation of Small Businesses has warned that many small UK businesses could be dragged down by Carillion\u2019s failure. FSB national chairman Mike Cherry says Carillion made its suppliers wait FOUR MONTHS before paying their bills. This means that many SMEs are nervously waiting to see if those invoices will still be paid. If not, they could be driven to the wall themselves. Cherry says: \u201cIt is vital that Carillion\u2019s small business suppliers are paid what they are owed, or some of those firms could themselves be put in jeopardy, putting even more jobs at risk besides those of Carillion\u2019s own employees. \u201cThese unpaid bills may well go back several months. I wrote to Carillion back in July last year to express concern after hearing from FSB members that the company was making small suppliers wait 120 days to be paid. \u201cSadly these kind of poor payment practices are all too common among some big corporates. Perhaps if they weren\u2019t it would be easier to spot the warning signs of a huge company in financial trouble. \u201cWhen the dust settles on this sorry saga, there is also a wider lesson to learn about the concentration of public contracts in the hands of a small number of very big businesses. Public procurement must be much more small-business friendly, in which it is easier for small firms to navigate the system and the Government should prioritise meeting its target of at least one third of taxpayer-funded contracts going to smaller firms.\u201d Labour MP Bill Esterson, the shadow business and international trade minister, fears that there could be a \u2018massive\u2019 impact: Carillion\u2019s demise has caused shockwaves in Westminster too. Lord Adonis, the Labour peer who recently resigned as Theresa May\u2019s infrastructure tsar, says the government has a lot of explaining to do. He suggests we could even be looking at a UK version of Enron - the US energy trader that spectacularly collapsed 15 years ago. Labour MP John Mann is calling for public sector contracts to be taken back into public control. Another Labour MP, Gordon Marsden, says the government has taken its eye off the ball as it wrestled with the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union. Carillion\u2019s collapse will affect hundreds of projects and contracts across the UK. Reuters explains: Britain\u2019s Carillion collapsed on Monday after its banks lost faith in the construction and services company, throwing hundreds of major projects into doubt and forcing the government to step in to guarantee vital public services. Carillion was forced into compulsory liquidation after costly contract delays and a slump in new business left it at the mercy of its lenders and battling a ballooning debt pile. The demise of the 200-year-old business poses a major headache for Theresa May\u2019s government which has employed Carillion to work on 450 projects including the building and maintenance of hospitals prisons, defence sites and the country\u2019s new superfast rail line..... Carillion has debt and liabilities of \u00a31.5bn pounds with creditors that include banks RBS, Santander UK, HSBC and others. It has a pension deficit, included within that figure, of \u00a3580ms. More here: Britain\u2019s Carillion collapses, forcing government to step in Carillion\u2019s slump into liquidation is a major talking point in the City today. Michael Hewson of financial spread-betting firm CMC Markets says: It appears to be the end of the road for Carillion, one of the UK\u2019s biggest construction companies, as it files for compulsory liquidation having run out of time to put together a restructuring package with its lenders. The likelihood of a government bailout would appear to be remote, though the outstanding public sector contracts are set to taken in-house and run by the UK government. In terms of assets Carillion based on its 2016 accounts has tangible plant and machinery of \u00a3144m, a fraction of its overall debts, not to mention the \u00a3800m pensions liabilities. Whether these services will then be tendered out to another provider in order to recoup some costs may well be difficult given the potential political fallout. Banks, government ministers and Carillion\u2019s own management must share the blame for the company\u2019s ignominious failure, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital: This was a case of bad management and pitching for contracts at any price, but the government and banks could, or may be should, have done more. Given the government was already up to its neck in this, shareholders have every right to be disappointed. The FCA is looking at the timing of profits warnings but you could also argue that the number and value of government contracts being awarded following those warnings also misled investors by painting a false picture of health. They may also question why banks that were bailed out by taxpayers were among those who forced the company to the brink. A terrible mess and one that will take a long time to clean up. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, warns that Carillion\u2019s collapse will send fear rippling through the economy. The government\u2019s decision to walk away from Carillion appears to be based on optics rather than logic and looks like the wrong decision was made for the wrong reasons. There is no doubt that Carillion posed a huge political challenge for the government, which did not want to be seen to bail out another group of private shareholders and banks after suffering such a backlash from their decisions during the financial crisis. However, the prospect of the government temporarily funding existing Carillion public service contracts, alongside the likely increase in costs for renegotiating contracts with new suppliers, make it highly likely that they could ultimately pay far more than if they had provided the guarantees that Carillion\u2019s creditors needed. Gemma Godfrey of investment site Moola says Carillion\u2019s collapse shows the downside of outsourcing public sector work to private companies. A private company makes profit from the project. And yet, when a situation like this arises, the government has to step in to make sure that the contracts are still honoured - as we\u2019re talking about our schools and our healthcare. We maintain the risk and have to bear some losses, as a taxpayer, rather than the private company that paid very large executive salaries. David Lidington ducked a question about whether a public inquiry should be held into Carillion, as he urged staff to keep working. But his opposite number, shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett MP, insists a \u2018serious investigation\u2019 is needed. Trickett says: \u201cThe Government must act quickly to bring these public sector contracts back in-house to protect public services and ensure employees, supply chain companies, taxpayers and pension fund members are protected. \u201cGiven \u00a32billion worth of Government contracts were awarded in the time three profit warnings were given by Carillion, a serious investigation needs to be launched into the Government\u2019s handling of this matter. \u201cIt is vital that shareholders and creditors are not allowed to walk away with the rewards from profitable contracts while the taxpayer bails out loss-making parts of the business.\u201d The government\u2019s \u201cfirst priority\u201d is to ensure that the public services that were delivered by Carillion continue to operate. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington tells Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that: \u201cThe first priority, the one that I\u2019ve asked ministers and all officials to concentrate on, is actually ensuring that public services continue. So the message to workers is, come in to work today, there\u2019s important work to be done, and you will be paid. The government will pay your wages via the official receiver, not via Carillion.\u201d \u201cAs we go forward, some services will be taken in house, some services will go out to alternative contractors in a managed, orderly fashion. Lidington adds that some services previously supplied by Carillion will, in time, be handed to other operators. As we go forwards, some services will be taken in house, some will go out to alternative providers in a managed, organised fashion. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, is on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme now discussing Carillion\u2019s collapse. Q: Why were huge contracts awarded to Carillion even though they were issuing profit warnings? Lidington says Carillion\u2019scollapse is regrettable. The government decided that taxpayers can\u2019t be expected to bail out a private sector company - especially when its problems didn\u2019t come directly from its public sector work. Contingency plans have been drawn up in recent months following Carillion\u2019s first profits warning in 2017, Lidington explains. That means that contracts were drawn up so that if Carillion failed, other contractors must now come in and take over Carillion\u2019s responsibilities. Q: But hedge funds have been betting against Carillion for months - why did you keep handing it new contracts? Lidington repeats that contracts were drawn up in a way to guarantee public services This is a \u201cmanaged liquidation and administration\u201d, he says, adding \u201cThere will not be a fire sale of assets. The government will pay the administrative costs of the Official Reciever so we can guarantee the supply of public services, he continues. Q: So will the taxpayer pick up the billl? Lidington says the government will pay the costs of the official receiver, but he believes this will be \u201cconsiderably less\u201d than the cost of an unplanned collapse. Oxfordshire County Council has issued a statement, saying it has taken over services provided by Carillion, such as school meals. The council has been \u201cplanning for the possibility of Carillion\u2019s collapse for some time,\u201d and expects workers to turn up for work as usual. If they don\u2019t, firefighters are \u2018on standby\u2019 to get Oxfordshire\u2019s children fed. Alexandra Bailey, the council\u2019s Director for Property, Assets and Investment, says: \u201cWe expect school staff will be in work as normal today but if this doesn\u2019t happen we will provide school lunches to schools needing support, and the fire service are on standby to deliver them. We are confident no child will go hungry at school. \u201cWe thank schools for their support and understanding as we deal with the situation. I\u2019d also like to thank staff for continuing to do a great job during a period of uncertainty, and to reassure them that the county council will ensure staff are paid.\u201d Carillions\u2019s shares have been temporarily suspended from trading on the London stock market. They have plunged in recent months, taking its value down to around \u00a360m. Good news for commuters: Carillion is the second biggest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail, though, so its collapse is still a significant event. Pressure is mounting fast on the UK government to set up a full public inquiry into the collapse of Carillion. Jim Kennedy, Unite\u2019s national officer for local government, says the company\u2019s management must be held to account: \u201cPublic services, vast amounts of public money, thousands of jobs - including in a lengthy supply chain of insecure agency workers who are also at risk - and workers\u2019 hard-saved pensions are all in danger of being dragged under by yet another bout of reckless corporate irresponsibility. \u201cThere are also serious questions that need to be asked and answered about Carillion\u2019s conduct. \u201cDid directors move to protect their bonuses before the financial stability of the company? \u201cHas the company mushroomed because it built its business on unrealistic undercutting and blacklisting? \u201cWhy did the government continue to hand over public money to a company that had issued repeated profits warnings?\u201d Labour\u2019s Rebecca Long-Bailey also called for a \u2018full investigation\u2019 into the debacle, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re ... asking for a full investigation into the government conduct of this matter. \u201cThis company issued three profit warnings in the last six months yet despite those profit warnings the government continued to award government contracts to this company.\u201d Financial analyst and journalist Louise Cooper is also struck by the decision to liquidate Carillion: Britain\u2019s unions says that Carillion\u2019s collapse shows the folly of employing private companies to provide services such as school meals. Rehana Azam, GMB National Secretary, explains: \u201cThe fact such a massive government contractor like Carillion has been allowed to go into administration shows the complete failure of a system that has put our public services in the grip of shady profit making contractors. \u201cThe priority now for the Government and administrators is making sure kids in schools still get fed to day - and our members still have jobs and pensions. \u201cThere is no place for private companies who answer to shareholders, not patients, parents and service users in our public services. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with Carillion yet again shows the perils of allowing privatisation to run rampant in our schools, our hospitals and our prisons.\u201d This is from Sky\u2019s News\u2019s Mark Kleinman: My colleague Rob Davies, who has been covering the Carillion story, tweets: Carillion\u2019s collapse will send shivers through the UK economy. As well as employing around 20,000 people in the UK, the company also uses thousands of smaller companies to help provide its services. The BBC\u2019s Joe Lynam says these firms must be very nervous... The decision to liquidate Carillion means the government is effectively taking control of the company, says City expert George Trefgarne. ITV business editor Joel Hills calls the situation \u2018highly unusual\u2019. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP adds that the government must \u2018step in immediately\u2019 to keep Carillion\u2019s operations running. That will give reassurance to workers that they will be transferred across into potential government institutions that will provide these services. It will also give comfort to those companies in the supply chain that rely on Carillion. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, is discussing Carillion\u2019s collapse on BBC Breakfast. She says the government should give a statement to parliament today, and must also explain why it allowed the crisis to blow up. Why did the government not act when profit warnings were issued? Why did they wait until the 11th hour to step in? Long-Bailey adds: What we don\u2019t want to see happen is the government to take on those contracts which are making a loss, while those contracts that are profitable are simply sold onto another company. That\u2019s not good enough. We want all those [public sector] contracts to be brought back into public control. The Guardian\u2019s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u2013 and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: Carillion\u2019s chairman, Philip Green, says he deeply regrets the decision to put the company into liquidation. But he insists there was no other option, after the company\u2019s \u2018stakeholders\u2019 (ie, its bankers) declined to provide more short-term financial support over the weekend. Here\u2019s the official statement from Green: \u201cThis is a very sad day for Carillion, for our colleagues, suppliers and customers that we have been proud to serve over many years. Over recent months huge efforts have been made to restructure Carillion to deliver its sustainable future and the Board is very grateful for the huge efforts made by Keith Cochrane, our executive team and many others who have worked tirelessly over this period. In recent days however we have been unable to secure the funding to support our business plan and it is therefore with the deepest regret that we have arrived at this decision. We understand that HM Government will be providing the necessary funding required by the Official Receiver to maintain the public services carried on by Carillion staff, subcontractors and suppliers.\u201d UK construction giant Carillion has spectacularly collapsed, after attempts to rescue the firm failed, putting thousands of jobs at risk. In the last few minutes, Carillion has announced that last-ditch talks over the weekend had not been successful. Its board have thus concluded that they have \u2018no choice\u2019 but to enter compulsory liquidation with immediate effect. The government will provide funding necessary to keep Carillion\u2019s contracts operating. That\u2019s an essential move, given the firm is involved in many public infrastructure projects - from transport and health to education and defence. PricewaterhouseCoopers will now be appointed as \u2018special managers\u2019 to handle the collapse of the company, which employs over 40,000 people and runs a wide range of public sector contracts. As we reported last night: The Cabinet Office hosted emergency talks on Sunday aimed at mapping out a future for a company that employs 43,000 people \u2013 including nearly 20,000 in the UK \u2013 but the meeting broke up without a rescue deal being announced. The company\u2019s bank lenders were considering a last-ditch appeal to fund a rescue plan, according to Sky News, but accountancy firm EY is standing ready to manage a potential administration process, which could be triggered as soon as Monday morning. Carillion\u2019s collapse leaves the UK government facing some tricky questions about why it kept handing the company contracts in recent months, even after a profit warning that showed it was struggling. It also puts the wider policy of using private sector firm to deliver public services under the microscope. As Labour MP Rebecca Long-Bailey tweeted last night, there are a lot of questions to answer.... We\u2019ll be tracking all the latest developments here....",

The FCA is looking at the timing of profits warnings but you could also argue that the number and value of government contracts being awarded following those warnings also misled investors by painting a false picture of health.

      "bodyText": "Firefighters are on standby to deliver school meals to children in at least one area of the country as councils and other public bodies scramble to deal with the collapse of the outsourcing firm, Carillion. The company provided a host of services to the NHS, as well as schools and other organisations across the country that will need to be covered. Oxfordshire county council, was forced to put the firefighters on notice after Carillion\u2019s downfall left the provision of school meals in the short term in doubt. Barnsley council said its secondary schools, which rely on Carillion for caretaking, cleaning and maintenance services, would operate as usual because Whitehall had guaranteed that work contracted to Carillion would be covered, but the council was unable to say exactly how on Monday. Andy Street, the former John Lewis boss who became the first mayor of the West Midlands last year, said he was setting up a taskforce to support employees of Carillion and its subcontractors who may be affected by the company\u2019s collapse. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know how many of those staff will transfer as some parts of the business hopefully are sold on,\u201d he said. There was the potential for major disruption to a road building project run in Leeds for which Carillion was made the preferred bidder only a week ago. The city council\u2019s chief executive said he was assessing the situation. A spokesman declined to say whether there were other bidders in the running, adding that the council was in no rush to push through a deal to get the project under way. Lincolnshire county council said it expected Carillion to continue work it was contracted to do on a bypass for the foreseeable future, though it said it would likely find a new contractor to complete the work. The construction company has been a major player in the education sector, mainly in schools but also universities where it has been involved in providing student accommodation. It says it has built 150 schools and says on its website to have been responsible for facilities management at 875, cleaning services at 245 and mechanical and fabric maintenance at 683. Many schools dependent on these services are tied up in expensive long-term PFI contracts. However, the Department for Education said Carillion had contracts that cover fewer than 250 schools in England. A spokesman said: \u201cOur priority is to ensure schools can continue to operate as usual. We have planned extensively for this and have been working with local authorities and academy trusts since before Christmas to make sure contingency plans are in place. We are continuing to offer support to schools help minimise disruption for pupils through our designated advice service.\u201d Jon Coles, the chief executive of United Learning, one of England\u2019s largest academy chains, tweeted that he hoped Carillion\u2019s demise might enable some schools to escape \u201cludicrous\u201d PFI deals. Until recent weeks, Carillion sponsored its own academies trust which was responsible for two primary schools in Tameside, Greater Manchester. Parents at one of the schools, the Discovery Academy in Hyde, were sent a letter last week announcing the trust was formally separating from Carillion and the name had changed from the Carillion Academies Trust to the Victorious Academies Trust. The chief operating officer, Nicky Wise, said discussions to separate began last July and were not connected to Carillion\u2019s current predicament. \u201cHaving set up the two academies, Carillion provided a large amount of rigour and support. As soon as the schools grew and became well established, it became sensible for the trust to become more independent and work on its own, and it did not need the sponsorship of Carillion any more.\u201d The trust still retains contracts with Carillion \u2013 including school meal provision, like other schools in Tameside. Wise said lunches were being delivered as normal on Monday. In Oxfordshire, the county council has taken over all services provided by Carillion, including some school meals and cleaning, and all staff have been told to report for work as usual. Carillion has provided school meals to 18,000 students at 90 schools in the county and is also responsible for facilities management and cleaning services at a number of schools. Most contracts were due to end by April, however. Alexandra Bailey, the council\u2019s director for property, assets and investment said: \u201cWe expect school staff will be in work as normal today but, if this does not happen, we will provide school lunches to schools needing support, and the fire service are on standby to deliver them. We are confident no child will go hungry at school.\u201d Nottinghamshire county council said Carillion handled some services in two of its schools and a leisure centre and that it was working with contractors to make sure normal service continued. Nottingham city council said three schools relied on Carillion and it had contingency measures in place. The Local Government Association, which represents 415 local authorities in England and Wales, said contingency plans had been implemented to ensure services were unaffected by Carillion\u2019s liquidation. A spokesman said a relatively small number of councils were affected.",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of staff who worked for the collapsed construction firm Carillion inside private sector companies will have their wages stopped on Wednesday unless their jobs are rescued by other firms, the government has said. Experts also said up to 30,000 small firms were owed money by Carillion, which crashed into liquidation on Monday morning, with insolvency practitioners reporting an immediate rush of calls from worried business owners. Ministers gathered for an emergency meeting on Monday night in an effort to limit the damage caused by the collapse of the sprawling construction and support services business. As the fallout spread, the Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, faced mounting pressure over the government\u2019s oversight of the firm\u2019s increasingly precarious finances in the months leading up to its failure. Lidington told parliament the government would continue to pay those among Carillion\u2019s 19,500 UK staff who work in public sector jobs, such as NHS cleaners and school catering. But he admitted thousands of Carillion\u2019s private sector workers \u2013 who perform jobs ranging from cleaning to catering, security and postroom services for organisations such as the Nationwide building society and BT Openreach \u2013 would be cut loose after 48 hours. \u201cThe position of private sector employees is that they will not be getting the same protection that we\u2019re offering to public sector employees, beyond a 48-hour period of grace,\u201d Lidington said. He added that this would give time for Carillion\u2019s private clients to decide if they wanted to terminate the contracts or step in to cover wages themselves. \u201cI think that is a reasonable gesture towards private sector employees,\u201d he said, adding that a Jobcentre Plus helpline had been set up. Liddington added that ministers had agreed to indemnify the Official Receiver who was now acting as liquidator to the company. The Cabinet Office circulated a minute from the minister saying the indemnity covered \u201cany claims and proceedings that are made against him personally\u201d. No value could be placed on the indemnity the minister\u2019s note said, but it was believed the likelihood of it being called upon \u201cis low\u201d. The impact of the company\u2019s implosion was immediately felt on Monday as workers at the Midland Metropolitan hospital \u2013 being built near Birmingham by Carillion \u2013 were locked out and sent home. The hospital, together with another in Liverpool, is at the centre of the problems that have beset the business. Both are substantially delayed and over budget. In a video released on Monday night, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, called Carillion\u2019s collapse a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d, adding that it was \u201ctime to put an end to the rip-off privatisation policies that have done serious damage to our public services and fleeced the public of billions of pounds\u201d. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader and former business secretary, said: \u201cThe government has mismanaged contracts so that fat cat bosses are able to get away with millions, hedge funds are able to make millions, while their jobs are at risk.\u201d The shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, asked Lidington why Carillion was not overseen by a crown representative \u2013 a monitor usually appointed to observe government suppliers in financial difficulty \u2013 during the three months leading up to its liquidation. He said that \u201cthe House will conclude [the Cabinet Office] was recklessly complacent\u201d. Earlier, the civil service chief executive, John Manzoni, told the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, which is now to launch an inquiry into outsourcing, that the crown representative was \u201crotated out\u201d over the summer. Manzoni said it was not until November that officials \u201creally started to notice\u201d the problems at Carillion, whose chairman, Philip Green, was an adviser to the prime minister on corporate responsibility until December 2016. Between July and November, Carillion issued three major profits warnings and its shares crashed by 91%. However, Manzoni insisted that a team watching events at the company had \u201cplayed a blinder\u201d. While Carillion\u2019s private sector staff face uncertainty over their pay, the company\u2019s former chief executive Richard Howson is still currently entitled to a \u00a3660,000 salary, even though he quit in July over the company\u2019s dismal performance. Lidington declined to say whether Howson, paid \u00a31.5m last year, would still get the money but he said official receivers managing the remains of Carillion could impose \u201csevere penalties\u201d on former directors. The Institute of Directors described a change to Carillion\u2019s pay policy in 2016 which made it harder for the company to reclaim bonuses as \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d. Amid concern about continuity of public services, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said the government had taken steps to make sure services were delivered \u201cas normal\u201d. But within hours of the firm\u2019s collapse, reverberations from its demise were being felt around the country. Firefighters in Oxfordshire were put on standby to serve school dinners, while the RMT rail workers\u2019 union said disruption to train cleaning services was \u201calmost inevitable\u201d because mobile cleaning crews who travel by van found that fuel cards issued by Carillion to pay for petrol no longer worked. After workers building the \u00a3590m Midland Metropolitan hospital in Smethwick were told to go home, the West Midlands mayor and former John Lewis boss Andy Street said a new contractor would have to be found, adding that he had set up a regional taskforce to help staff and suppliers. Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson said \u201csolid contingency plans\u201d were in place to make sure the \u00a3490m Royal Liverpool University hospital was not further delayed. Small business experts warned Carillion\u2019s suppliers could be driven under if they were not paid. Suzannah Nichol, chief executive of trade body Build UK, said she estimated Carillion owed money to between 25,000 and 30,000 businesses which could now struggle. \u201cLooking at previous cases where large contractors have collapsed, you typically see that around 17% or 18% of businesses who are creditors [...] don\u2019t make it through the next five years,\u201d she warned. Insolvency firm Mazars said it was already fielding calls from affected Carillion suppliers. Major partners on key Carillion projects admitted they were bound to take a financial hit from picking up its share of projects. Construction firm Balfour Beatty, which is working on the \u00a3550m Aberdeen bypass, said it expected the collapse to cost it \u00a345m, with partner Galliford Try sharing costs that could reach \u00a380m. But Serco, which provides some of the same services as Carillion, saw its shares rise more than 7% on the demise of a major rival. Carillion\u2019s engineering partner on HS2 work, Kier Group, said it would take over Carillion\u2019s share of the rail project. The Financial Reporting Council, the accountancy watchdog, said it had been \u201cactively monitoring\u201d the situation and would make a statement shortly. Auditor KPMG, which signed off on Carillion\u2019s 2016 accounts, said it had conducted its duties \u201cappropriately and responsibly\u201d. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was trusted to build some of the country\u2019s most important infrastructure \u2013 from NHS hospitals to much-needed new road projects \u2013 yet the foundations of construction giant Carillion were shaky enough for the group to be felled by just four contracts. Two were for much-needed new hospitals \u2013 and work on both was immediately halted as the company collapsed. Revenues of more than \u00a35bn \u2013 plus annual profits approaching \u00a3200m \u2013 turned out to be limited props for a company when the facade began to crumble by the summer of last year. Back then, Carillion shares slumped by 70% in a month as it was forced into a monster profit warning following an \u00a3845m writedown. Much of that \u2013 \u00a3375m \u2013 was blamed on just three large public private partnership (PPP) contracts in the UK. Another \u00a3470m was dressed up as the cost of pulling out of several overseas markets. Carillion never officially revealed exactly which deals had gone so badly wrong, but it quickly became an open secret in the market: the construction of two English hospitals \u2013 where workers said on Monday they have already begun to be laid off \u2013 one Scottish road and a development in Doha, the capital of Qatar. Together they were enough to kill off the company. The three UK deals were Merseyside\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d\u00a3335m Royal Liverpool University hospital, the \u00a3350m Midland Metropolitan hospital being built in Smethwick and a road project called the Aberdeen western peripheral route \u2013 all of which were beset by seemingly innocuous problems that caused more and more embarrassing delays and mounting costs. Construction of the Royal Liverpool University hospital \u2013 a prestige project to build a new facility with 646 beds, the biggest single-bedroom hospital in England \u2013 ran into problems when workers found \u201cextensive\u201d asbestos on the brownfield site and cracks in the new building. In Smethwick, delays were blamed on \u201cthe fitting of pipes and wires [taking] longer than expected\u201d. The opening of both new hospitals has been delayed by a year. At least, those was the last estimates: no work was being carried out at the Royal in Liverpool on Monday, while local West Midlands media was reporting a similar suspension at Smethwick. A worker on the new Midland Metropolitan hospital building told the BBC: \u201cEveryone on the site got told: \u2018That\u2019s it, go home\u2019. My company said, \u2018You\u2019ve been laid off\u2019.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve literally locked the gate. They\u2019ve told us we can get our personal tools off the site if they\u2019re small, but that\u2019s it.\u201d In Aberdeen, the schedule slippage was blamed on more predictable problems: cold weather during winter. In Doha the big issue was a \u00a3200m dispute over money \u2013 cash owed on a project linked to preparations for the 2022 Fifa World Cup. Local reports suggest Carillion was not paid for almost a year\u2019s work. The Qatar Foundation, which was backing the development, did not return phone calls to elaborate. All of which is a disaster not just for Carillion workers, whose jobs are now under threat, and for patients awaiting new hospitals and drivers wanting another road. It is a blow to the entire government policy around PPP, and it was possible to detect a hint of panic inside Whitehall on Monday, with the Cabinet Office stating: \u201cFor clarity \u2013 all employees should keep coming to work, you will continue to get paid. Staff that are engaged on public sector contracts still have important work to do.\u201d PPP is one of those financial inventions that was sold as being a win-win for both sides: the companies could be awarded lots of lucrative contracts to build stuff for the state; the government would get new infrastructure more quickly and without the financial risk, as private companies would bid for the work and the market would ensure taxpayer value. At least, that was the theory. What actually happened was that companies kept bidding for projects, but tough competition meant the contracts came with skinnier and skinnier margins. So, if problems occurred, a contractor\u2019s 2% profit would not just be wiped out \u2013 huge losses could be incurred too. Sam Cullen, an analyst at investment bank Jefferies, said: \u201cThat is why construction can be such a fundamentally horrendous business. Under pressure to grow the top line and operating on wafer-thin margins, everyone bids each other to death. It\u2019s a situation not helped when your largest customer, the government, is under huge pressure to get value for money and is more susceptible to accept the lowest bidder.\u201d The big question is: why do companies keep bidding, if the contracts can cause so much pain? The answer probably lies in the structure of major PPP construction deals, because they hand the contract winner a large chunk of cash upfront. Work on construction can then begin, while contractors like Carillion may not need to start paying sub-contractors for another 120 days. During those four months, much of the upfront payment might be used to pay other debts within the business, meaning these deals can create situations where firms have to keep winning new contracts just to keep going. Or, as it turns out, not keep going. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 January 2018 to remove a reference to Aberdeen having a Highland\u2019s winter.",

Two were for much-needed new hospitals \u2013 and work on both was immediately halted as the company collapsed.</p> \n<p>Revenues of more than \u00a35bn \u2013 plus annual profits approaching \u00a3200m \u2013 turned out to be limited props for a company when the facade began to crumble by the summer of last year.</p> \n<p>Back then, Carillion shares slumped by 70% in a month as it was forced into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/13/carillion-has-no-future-without-rights-issue-of-at-least-500m\">a monster profit warning following an \u00a3845m writedown</a>.</p> \n<p>Much of that \u2013 \u00a3375m \u2013 was blamed on just three large public private partnership (PPP) contracts in the UK. Another \u00a3470m was dressed up as the cost of pulling out of several overseas markets.</p> \n<p>Carillion never officially revealed exactly which deals had gone so badly wrong, but it quickly became an open secret in the market: the construction of two English hospitals \u2013 where workers said on Monday they have already begun to be laid off \u2013 one Scottish road and a development in Doha, the capital of Qatar. Together they were enough to kill off the company.</p> \n<p>The three UK deals were Merseyside\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d\u00a3335m Royal Liverpool University hospital, the \u00a3350m Midland Metropolitan hospital being built in Smethwick and a road project called the Aberdeen western peripheral route \u2013 all of which were beset by seemingly innocuous problems that caused more and more embarrassing delays and mounting costs.</p> \n<p>Construction of <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/construction-new-royal-hospital-delayed-12823229\">the Royal Liverpool University hospital</a> \u2013 a prestige project to build a new facility with 646 beds, the biggest single-bedroom hospital in England \u2013 ran into problems when workers found \u201cextensive\u201d asbestos on the brownfield site and cracks in the new building.</p> \n<p>In Smethwick, delays were blamed on \u201cthe fitting of pipes and wires [taking] longer than expected\u201d.</p> \n<p>The opening of both new hospitals has been delayed by a year.

The collapse of Carillion was regrettable and disappointing, he said in statement to the Commons. Moments later he described the liquidation as disappointing and regrettable. It was all disappointingly regrettable. Or regrettably disappointing. The newly appointed Cabinet Office minister didn\u2019t really have much more than that to say about Carillion, other than it definitely wasn\u2019t his fault. No one could possibly have predicted the firm was going bust. \u201cThe government always has robust contingency plans in place for failure,\u201d he insisted. Albeit ones that didn\u2019t take any account of the series of profit warnings. Carillion was just one of those things. Something to write down to experience and move on from. Going forward. Even though he and the government definitely knew nothing about anything because there had never been anything to know, he was absolutely certain that the company\u2019s problems were entirely down to the contracts they had taken out with private firms and not ones they had taken out with the government. But Carillion employees weren\u2019t to worry because he had just set up a Jobcentre Plus helpline for anyone who lost their job. It was all said with an air of faint bemusement and emotional detachment. Lidington couldn\u2019t have sounded as if he gave less of a toss if he had tried. The shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, was less than impressed. Which bit of the three CEOs, the three profit warnings and the short-selling on the stock market had Lidington failed to notice? Why was the government still handing out \u00a32bn worth of contracts long after everyone in the country except Chris Grayling and a couple of other dopey ministers had noticed the company was in trouble? And how did he feel about the irony of the Carillion board chairman being the government\u2019s corporate responsibility tsar? It was only now that the gravity of the situation appeared to dawn on Lidington. His ears reddened to a deep crimson. A sure sign that he was out of his depth and severely pissed off about having to take the flak for other ministers\u2019 lapses. There again, he was in good company. There can\u2019t be a member of the cabinet who hasn\u2019t had to cover up for the careless stupidity of Failing Grayling. It was just Lidington\u2019s bad luck that it was his turn. \u201cLabour is just scaremongering,\u201d he blustered. Scaremongering as in telling the truth. Carillion had been in tip-top shape when all the government contracts had been handed out and no one could persuade him otherwise. He had one story and he was going to stick to it. Though he was regretful and disappointed. And disappointed and regretful. A series of prominent Labour backbenchers, including Emma Reynolds, Rachel Reeves and Hilary Benn, were rather more clued up on Carillion\u2019s failures than Lidington and pressed him for both an apology and reassurances. Neither was forthcoming. The Jobcentre Plus helpline was going to be the extent of the government\u2019s largesse. Which was more than enough for Tory backbenchers, who seemed to think the whole thing was a bit of a storm in a teacup. Something that would be here one day and gone the next. Much like the 20,000 Carillion jobs. Bill Cash and Cheryl Gillan even wondered if there wasn\u2019t a possible upside to the liquidation. With the HS2 contracts flatlining, maybe now would be the time for the government to call off the railway line that was going to run through their constituencies. It\u2019s good to know that some people can maintain a sense of perspective.",

Even though he and the government definitely knew nothing about anything because there had never been anything to know, he was absolutely certain that the company\u2019s problems were entirely down to the contracts they had taken out with private firms and not ones they had taken out with the government.</p> <p>But Carillion employees weren\u2019t to worry because he had just set up a Jobcentre Plus helpline for anyone who lost their job. It was all said with an air of faint bemusement and emotional detachment. Lidington couldn\u2019t have sounded as if he gave less of a toss if he had tried.</p> <p>The shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, was less than impressed. Which bit of the three CEOs, the three profit warnings and the short-selling on the stock market had Lidington failed to notice? Why was the government still handing out \u00a32bn worth of contracts long after everyone in the country except Chris Grayling and a couple of other dopey ministers had noticed the company was in trouble? And how did he feel about the irony of the Carillion board chairman being the government\u2019s corporate responsibility tsar?</p> <p>It was only now that the gravity of the situation appeared to dawn on Lidington. His ears reddened to a deep crimson. A sure sign that he was out of his depth and severely pissed off about having to take the flak for other ministers\u2019 lapses. There again, he was in good company. There can\u2019t be a member of the cabinet who hasn\u2019t had to cover up for the careless stupidity of Failing Grayling. It was just Lidington\u2019s bad luck that it was his turn.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There can\u2019t be a member of the cabinet who hasn\u2019t had to cover up for the careless stupidity of Failing Grayling</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cLabour is just scaremongering,\u201d he blustered. Scaremongering as in telling the truth. Carillion had been in tip-top shape when all the government contracts had been handed out and no one could persuade him otherwise. He had one story and he was going to stick to it. Though he was regretful and disappointed. And disappointed and regretful.</p> <p>A series of prominent Labour backbenchers, including Emma Reynolds, Rachel Reeves and Hilary Benn, were rather more clued up on Carillion\u2019s failures than Lidington and pressed him for both an apology and reassurances. Neither was forthcoming. The Jobcentre Plus helpline was going to be the extent of the government\u2019s largesse.</p> <p>Which was more than enough for Tory backbenchers, who seemed to think the whole thing was a bit of a storm in a teacup. Something that would be here one day and gone the next. Much like the 20,000 Carillion jobs. Bill Cash and Cheryl Gillan even wondered if there wasn\u2019t a possible upside to the liquidation. With the HS2 contracts flatlining, maybe now would be the time for the government to call off the railway line that was going to run through their constituencies. It\u2019s good to know that some people can maintain a sense of perspective.</p>",

Silvana Tenreyro, one of the nine members of Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), which sets UK interest rates, said 75% of the decrease in growth of output per worker since the financial crisis a decade ago was due to manufacturing and financial services, but that a period of catch-up was feasible. \u201cThe UK productivity level is below that of other advanced economies,\u201d Tenreyro said in London. \u201cThe silver lining is that there is scope to catch up with the frontier. How? By adopting technologies and processes that enhance productivity and are already tested and in place in other countries.\u201d The MPC member said that in the three decades leading up to the 2008 financial crisis Britain\u2019s productivity grew by 2.3% a year on average, but in the decade since had slowed to 0.4% a year. The other six members of the G7 \u2013 the US, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan \u2013 had output per head 18% higher on average than the UK, leaving plenty of scope for Britain to close the gap. \u201cThe big question is the timing for that catch-up. The global economy and Europe in particular are undergoing a big investment boom, yet the UK is not part of it,\u201d said Tenreyro. \u201cWhy is the UK the odd one out? The likely culprit is the uncertainty regarding future EU trading relations, which many have argued, and I agree, is keeping the levels of domestic and foreign investment in the country relatively low in relation to what one would expect at this stage of the global cycle. We will have to live with some of that uncertainty for some time. And, understandably, firms will postpone some of the investments and structural changes needed to increase productivity.\u201d Tenreyro said she was optimistic about the long term because good institutions, a favourable location, top-class research and good human capital meant firms in the UK were well placed to be at the technological frontier. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "GKN and its would-be buyer, the turnaround specialist Melrose, are lobbying the engineering firm\u2019s shareholders as the battle for control hots up. The news helped push GKN\u2019s shares up more than 4% to 437.4p, compared with the current value of the Melrose offer of about 424p a share \u2013 or more than \u00a37bn. This suggests the City expects either a higher offer from Melrose, or perhaps a rival bidder. On Friday GKN\u2019s shares surged 25% as it rejected the proposed offer from Melrose, saying it undervalued the company, and put forward its own plans to split into separate aerospace and automotive businesses. GKN has been vulnerable since November, when it issued a shock profit warning following problems at its US aerospace business. That led to the departure of the proposed chief executive Keith Cummings, who had run the underperforming unit, before he had taken up the post. Anne Stevens, who was announced as GKN\u2019s new chief executive on Friday, is meeting investors to persuade them that the current management team is best placed to turn the business around. However, Melrose is telling GKN investors that the firm is undermanaged and lacks focus. The Melrose chief executive, Simon Peckham, said: \u201cGKN shareholders can elect to sell in the market right now for a substantial premium to Friday\u2019s opening price \u2026 Or they can choose to combine their business with ours and have the majority share in what we are confident will be a business capable of significant value enhancement.\u201d The meetings are expected to continue over the next two weeks, with Melrose likely to unveil its formal offer after that. The analyst Andrew Gollan at Berenberg said a raised offer of 455p would be hard to reject: \u201cWe expect Melrose to return with a higher offer for GKN and for it to be accepted. There is an air of inevitability that GKN will end up being owned by Melrose. \u201d Rival bidders such as private equity firms may yet gatecrash the bid, with Carlyle mentioned as a possible candidate. The activist investor Elliott has taken a stake in GKN and a short position in Melrose. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "body": "<p>GKN and its would-be buyer, the turnaround specialist Melrose, are lobbying the engineering firm\u2019s shareholders as the battle for control hots up.</p> <p>The news helped push GKN\u2019s shares up more than 4% to 437.4p, compared with the current value of the Melrose offer of about 424p a share \u2013 or more than \u00a37bn. This suggests the City expects either a higher offer from Melrose, or perhaps a rival bidder.</p> <p>On Friday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/12/gkn-rejects-7bn-hostile-approach-melrose-vince-cable\">GKN\u2019s shares surged 25% as it rejected the proposed offer from Melrose,</a> saying it undervalued the company, and put forward its own plans to split into separate aerospace and automotive businesses.</p> <p>GKN has been vulnerable since November, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/16/gkn-chief-executive-writedown-kevin-cummings\">it issued a shock profit warning</a> following problems at its US aerospace business.

      "bodyText": "Responsibility for Carillion\u2019s collapse lies in the boardroom. It is the job of the directors to manage risk and the eight pages of Carillion\u2019s last annual report devoted to the subject clearly only scratched the surface. Chairman Philip Green should have spent less time wondering about the long-terms risks from Brexit and more time addressing the upfront and present dangers from cost over-runs on three big jobs: new hospitals in Liverpool and Smethwick plus the Aberdeen bypass. The walk-on role played the auditors, KPMG, will go under the Financial Reporting Council\u2019s microscope in due course. But the hard fact is that Carillion directors were boasting in March last year of having \u201csubstantial liquidity with some \u00a31.5bn of available funding\u201d yet the company ran out of money 10 months later. That suggests delusion in the boardroom on a grand scale. Hedge funds, looking from outside and betting on the shares going south, seem to have had a better grasp of Carillion\u2019s financial distress than the insiders. As usual with the construction sector, the immediate cause of failure is a mix of badly priced contracts, badly managed risks plus too much debt. On a good day, contracting firms run on tight operating margins of 3%. If debt is too high, there is little room to absorb calamitous contracts. When three contracts go sour in quick succession, the numbers can spiral out of control. Balfour Beatty was in a similar, but smaller, hole four years ago and managed to claw its way out. By the time Carillion revealed its crisis \u2013 via a monumental profit warning last July that felled chief executive Richard Howson \u2013 events had run too far. In the end, it comes down to judgments made in the boardroom. Carillion, outrageously, was declaring a fatter dividend for shareholders only last spring. Given what we know now, the correct action would have been to go to those investors and ask for a big injection of capital via a rights issue. Half the board would have had to resign, but an over-stretched balance sheet might have been repaired. Instead Carillion seems to have chosen to chase more low-margin contracts in a desperate attempt to keep its revenue line moving. In the circumstances, the government had no choice but to let the company go bust. Carillion had six months to organise its own rescue and failed, despite being thrown a few contracts such as work on HS2 to buy breathing space. Besides, a bailout of Carillion would also have been a bailout of the company\u2019s banks and bondholders, who definitely don\u2019t deserve it since they were asleep to the risks as much as the directors. The government has still inherited a fine old mess \u2013 and, however much ministers talk up their \u201ccontingency\u201d plans, it seems highly likely that costs from Carillion\u2019s failure will rebound on the public purse. It is a relatively simple matter to take facility-management contracts (covering prisons and schools so forth) in-house or award them to other operators. A similar shuffle can be performed on building contracts where Carillion was part of a consortium: fellow members can be pushed to fill the empty shoes, just as Balfour and Gailford Try have on the Aberdeen bypass. But the thicket is deeper when it comes to Carillion\u2019s hospital work, conducted via public-private partnerships and special purpose vehicles with a different set of lenders from the parent. Untangling that mess could prove hellish. Do joint venture equity partners have to be bought out before a new contractor can be appointed? How much will a new builder demand to complete another company\u2019s half-finished job? How much longer will new hospitals in Liverpool and Smethwick be delayed? Whatever the answers, a review of these public-private deals is long overdue. A bare-minimum reform might be a balance-sheet test to lessen the likelihood of a big contractor falling over in a heap, threatening chaos for local subcontractors. A second moral is that the Pensions Regulator needs more power to order companies to close deficits. The same annual report boasts of 16 years of unbroken dividend growth yet pensioners are now being thrown into the pensions lifeboat. How could a company with Carillion\u2019s pension deficit \u2013 \u00a3580m \u2013 be allowed to pay \u00a383m in dividends last year? It\u2019s a nonsense. The last conclusion is the official receiver should immediately demand the repayment of executive bonuses for 2016. Clawback conditions were relaxed that year, but the moral case is overwhelming for Howson to hand back his \u00a3245,000 bonus plus whatever he cashed from his \u00a3346,000 share-based award.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair giveth and Michael O\u2019Leary taketh away. A little over four years since the Irish airline allowed passengers to carry a second bag on board, passengers were on Monday getting to grips with new rules that meant they either had to pay \u00a35 or put their wheelie suitcase in the hold. The airline insisted that the move was fair and would reduce delays, with the caveat that a maximum 100 passengers per flight paying for priority boarding will be allowed to take their cases into the cabin. But consumer groups warned that passengers could risk being uninsured for losses, while some sceptical passengers wondered if this was just another money-making ruse from Ryanair. Travellers who do not cough up will have their small wheelie suitcases tagged with a yellow label and removed at the gate, facing a wait on arrival at the carousel to reclaim bags. The permitted cabin bag must now be small enough to fit under the seat in front. Defending the changes, Ryanair said that not all hand baggage could now fit in overhead lockers due to fuller planes, and many passengers were already being stopped at the gate to be asked to put their cases in the hold. While the airline had famously charged high baggage fees to reduce handling costs and fuel, it has now cut the price of pre-booking hold luggage to \u00a325 from \u00a335 and also increased the weight allowance to 20kg. Passengers at Stansted airport, Ryanair\u2019s largest UK base, were broadly unfazed by the move on Monday, with a few exceptions \u2013 although many at check-in appeared to have missed the warning memo from Ryanair. Glynis Griffiths, a semi-retired teacher living in Gaillac, France, was returning home via Toulouse with her husband, Adrian, and not looking forward to placing her wheelie case in the hold. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s free now, but you know Ryanair \u2013 in six weeks you\u2019re bound to pay more. We always travel light and carry on our bags \u2013 if my case ever goes missing it\u2019s very hard to find clothes in my size.\u201d But many arriving passengers said the new policy appeared effective. Kirsty Murray, 23, a student from Glasgow, had arrived from Bremen. \u201cI found it speedier to be honest and calmer onboard \u2013 less people faffing with their bags. But there were some unhappy people in Bremen, who didn\u2019t want to leave their cases at the bottom of the plane steps.\u201d One traveller had felt the pinch of Ryanair\u2019s new bag crackdown. Paige Morawiec, 20, a student, had to stump up \u20ac40 (\u00a336) in Bremen at departures to put her case in the hold at check-in because her luggage could not fit in the bagagge sizer. \u201cIt was so close, I probably could have squeezed it in if I\u2019d really squashed it.\u201d Others had somehow evaded Ryanair\u2019s bag police. Peter Burns, 37, a sculptor travelling from Knock in Ireland, had carried on a travelling bag and a large carrier containing a fragile sculpture. He said: \u201cI guess I\u2019m just lucky. I saw them putting yellow labels on bags, but no one seemed to ask so I just chanced my arm.\u201d One Ryanair crew member expressed relief. \u201cIt was much better on board, and we pushed off five minutes earlier. Especially coming from Athens where people take three bags on board.\u201d Customers at other airports expressed frustration that not all staff seemed to be enforcing the new policy, with one blaming \u201ca shambles with cabin bags\u201d for flight delays in Spain. The consumer group Which? warned passengers that they might not be insured for loss, theft or damage of valuables if their luggage ended up in the hold. Travel editor Rory Boland said: \u201cWe would advise travellers to remove wallets, keys, laptops and other important or expensive items from any bag the airline plans to put in the hold. If anything does go missing, you should claim against the airline as they should honour your rights under the Montreal Convention.\u201d Ryanair said all customers had been emailed and informed of the change, and boarding passes redesigned to show whether a customer would be allowed to bring on their wheelie or not. Passengers can buy priority boarding up to 30 minutes before a flight departs. Kenny Jacobs, marketing manager, said the new policy was fair, would speed up boarding and eliminate the risk of delays from too many bags being brought on board. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

While the airline had famously charged high baggage fees to reduce handling costs and fuel, it has now cut the price of pre-booking hold luggage to \u00a325 from \u00a335 and also increased the weight allowance to 20kg.</p> <p> Passengers at Stansted airport, Ryanair\u2019s largest UK base, were broadly unfazed by the move on Monday, with a few exceptions \u2013 although many at check-in appeared to have missed the warning memo from Ryanair.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/24/ryanair-delays-stricter-cabin-bag-policy\">Ryanair delays stricter cabin bag policy</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Glynis Griffiths, a semi-retired teacher living in Gaillac, France, was returning home via Toulouse with her husband, Adrian, and not looking forward to placing her wheelie case in the hold. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s free now, but you know Ryanair \u2013 in six weeks you\u2019re bound to pay more. We always travel light and carry on our bags \u2013 if my case ever goes missing it\u2019s very hard to find clothes in my size.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p> But many arriving passengers said the new policy appeared effective. Kirsty Murray, 23, a student from Glasgow, had arrived from Bremen. \u201cI found it speedier to be honest and calmer onboard \u2013 less people faffing with their bags. But there were some unhappy people in Bremen, who didn\u2019t want to leave their cases at the bottom of the plane steps.\u201d </p> <p> One traveller had felt the pinch of Ryanair\u2019s new bag crackdown. Paige Morawiec, 20, a student, had to stump up \u20ac40 (\u00a336) in Bremen at departures to put her case in the hold at check-in because her luggage could not fit in the bagagge sizer. \u201cIt was so close, I probably could have squeezed it in if I\u2019d really squashed it.\u201d</p> <p> Others had somehow evaded Ryanair\u2019s bag police. Peter Burns, 37, a sculptor travelling from Knock in Ireland, had carried on a travelling bag and a large carrier containing a fragile sculpture. He said: \u201cI guess I\u2019m just lucky. I saw them putting yellow labels on bags, but no one seemed to ask so I just chanced my arm.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p> One Ryanair crew member expressed relief. \u201cIt was much better on board, and we pushed off five minutes earlier. Especially coming from Athens where people take three bags on board.\u201d</p> <p> Customers at other airports expressed frustration that not all staff seemed to be enforcing the new policy, with one blaming \u201ca shambles with cabin bags\u201d for flight delays in Spain. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CJ_Marston/status/952813402610720768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ryanair?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Ryanair</a> PLEASE, if you&#39;re going to implement a new baggage policy have the staff ready to deal with it.

If anything does go missing, you should claim against the airline as they should honour your rights under the Montreal Convention.\u201d</p> <p> Ryanair said all customers had been emailed and informed of the change, and boarding passes redesigned to show whether a customer would be allowed to bring on their wheelie or not.

      "bodyText": "As the latest clutch of arthouse films \u2013 including Darkest Hour and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri \u2013 are feted during this year\u2019s awards season, the mid-budget film sector is grappling with Hollywood\u2019s blockbuster addiction and the new challenges presented by Netflix and Amazon. The big US studios have become increasingly dependent on big-budget, populist releases that can pack cinemas around the world, for example superhero films and franchises such as Transformers, Pirates of the Caribbean and Fast and the Furious Couple that with the Netflix-driven explosion in top quality TV drama that has wrested budgets and talent away from Hollywood, and smaller film-makers are struggling for backing. \u201cThere is definitely a squeezing of the middle,\u201d says Richard Cooper, a film analyst at the entertainment consultancy Ampere. Disney, the most successful Hollywood studio in recent years, released just eight films last year, including the three of the five biggest box office earners 0f 2017 in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 and Beauty and the Beast. The seven biggest Hollywood studios made 113 movies last year, hoovering up nearly $10bn (\u00a37.2bn) of the total $11bn US box office take in the world\u2019s largest film market. This meant that the other 618 films released had to fight furiously to capture the remaining 9% slice of ticket sales from the increasingly dwindling number of movie goers. Despite the dominance of blockbusters, a near-record number of smaller-budget films were released last year. They are coming under pressure as the average US box office take of each film has dropped by over 40% since 2013, according to research by Ampere. Then there is the impact of the rise of streaming services led by Netflix and Amazon. Netflix spent \u00a3100m ($136m) on two series of glossy TV drama The Crown. This is almost triple what it cost to make awards favourites Darkest Hour ($38m) and Three Billboards ($12m). Nevertheless, film-makers are also starting to cash in on the deep-pocketed digital players. Netflix has increased its total content budget from $6bn to $8bn this year and intends to make 80 original films (up significantly from 50 in 2017) \u2013 about the same as the big five Hollywood studios. \u201cIt is kind of like Dickens, it\u2019s the best of times and the worst of times,\u201d said Colin Vaines, producer of films including awards hopeful Film Stars Don\u2019t Die in Liverpool and The Young Victoria. \u201cThere are new possibilities with Netflix, Amazon and Apple, potentially lots of opportunity if you can get a foot in the door and be one of the chosen few to go through.\u201d Vaines said one issue is that Netflix generally does not give a theatrical release to the films it produces or buys, which makes it harder to get the publicity for smaller-scale productions. \u201cAmazon do theatrical releases but Netflix don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cIt does give additional lift in terms of selling your film. The biggest issue for mid-budget films is you want some kind of lift to get your film out there.\u201d The director of Film4, Daniel Battsek, who has developed and backed the hotly-tipped Three Billboards, said Channel 4\u2019s film division has had to adjust its strategy to address the new-look market. Film4 has increased its co-investment budget by two-thirds from \u00a315m to \u00a325m and now makes fewer films with a larger investment to increase its returns per movie. \u201cAudiences have a desire to see more than just superheroes and franchise movies,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course people can get satisfaction from TV and streaming services, but not exclusively. \u201cThree Billboards could have been made for a streaming service, but that is not how it was envisaged. It has made more than $40m already, that is testament to the faith we all had in creating something people would be incentivised to see in a cinema and get the most out of it.\u201d Battsek said that the definition of success for an independent film is not in terms of box officesales, but in relative return on investment. \u201cA film may be a blockbuster, but if it cost $150m to make and $100m to market that is a big bar to get over in terms of profitability,\u201d he said. Three Billboards has made $40m at the box office to date \u2013 more than triple its budget \u2013 having only just started a roll-out beyond the US, including the UK last Friday. Darkest Hour, which also launched in the UK on Friday, has passed the $55m takings mark, covering its $38m budget. Claudia Bluemhuber, managing partner at Swiss finance and production company Silver Reel, said that with independent film-making facing so much competition there is much tighter focus on which projects to back. Silver Reel has invested in films including The Wife, which stars Glenn Close, Loving Vincent and Churchill. \u201cWe have seen that awards-worthy films are something that have become increasingly important from an economic point of view, more so than before the digital revolution and rise of the streaming services,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are focused on independent drama, but the risk has risen. Buyers and distributors of films are more nervous, and under more pressure to get it right.\u201d \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "webTitle": "Carillion's 'highly inappropriate' pay packets criticised", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The main lobby group representing UK bosses has savaged the \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d pay packets awarded to directors running the now-collapsed construction giant Carillion. The Institute of Directors also accused directors and shareholders of the stricken firm of failing to provide \u201cappropriate oversight\u201d of the company, which is involved in a host of major government projects and vital public services and slumped into compulsory liquidation on Monday. Roger Barker, head of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors, said the collapse of the company \u201csuggests that effective governance was lacking at Carillion\u201d. He added: \u201cWe must now consider if the board and shareholders have exercised appropriate oversight prior to the collapse. \u201cThere are some worrying signs. The relaxation of clawback conditions for executive bonuses in 2016 appears in retrospect to be highly inappropriate. It does no good to the reputation of UK business when top managers appear to benefit in spite of the collapse of the organisations that they are responsible for.\u201d His comments on clawback refer to a change in the company\u2019s pay policy made in 2016 that limited the criteria under which the company could demand the repayment of executive bonuses. Previously the firm could ask for cash back if the business went bust but the revised policy said it could only do so in the event of gross misconduct or if the financial results had been misstated. The chair of the remuneration committee, which sets the pay policy and made the change, is the non-executive Carillion director Alison Horner, head of human resources at Tesco. Much of the criticism has centred on Richard Howson, Carillion\u2019s former chief executive from 2012 until a shock profit warning last July resulted in his stepping down. Howson earned \u00a31.5m in 2016, including \u00a3591,000 in bonuses. He continued to work for the firm until last autumn after stepping down as chief executive and is due to stay on the payroll, receiving his \u00a3660,000 salary and \u00a328,000 benefits for another year, until October 2018. Howson\u2019s replacement, the interim chief executive, Keith Cochrane, was a Carillion non-executive director who joined the company in July 2015. He was due to step aside in favour of a new permanent chief executive next week \u2013 but Cochrane is also set to keep on receiving his \u00a3750,000 base salary until July. The former finance director Zafar Khan, who stepped down last September from his \u00a3425,000 a year job, is also due be paid until July. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader and former business secretary, said he hoped that bonuses paid to Carillion\u2019s chief executive would be clawed back.

More than half a million black cars were registered in 2017, overtaking white as the colour of choice for the first time since 2012. Black last returned to the top in the midst of the financial crisis, in 2009, after years of noughties prosperity when shiny silver cars proliferated. Red cars have fallen out of favour, however, as they slipped out of the top five. Pink and mauve are also on the wane, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. An underlying trend appears to be the inexorable rise of grey cars \u2013 a phenomenon that experts have said could be attributed to Donald Trump, although the US president has yet to tweet to claim credit. The website of the colour psychology consultant Karen Haller says: \u201cWhen there is a level of insecurity and uncertainty \u2013 as we have seen following the US elections and Brexit \u2013 we tend to retreat and gravitate towards things that make us safe, which is why grey is so popular.\u201d Sales of 500,714 grey cars last year were the colour\u2019s highest annual UK figures on record. In the east Midlands, grey is now the most popular colour of all. A primary colour has not made the top three since 2010. Austerity Britain\u2019s appetite for monochrome cars is such that almost 60% are registered in black, grey or white \u2013 with silver accounting for another 10%. Green, orange and yellow have all increased their market share, albeit to a cumulative 2.3%. Bronze has re-entered the top 10 at the expense of dull brown, and gold is the fastest growing in popularity. Demand for gold is up 19.1%, although it accounts for only one in 500 cars sold. Other reasons for the reascension of black might be more prosaic: an ever higher proportion of new cars bought in the UK have been purchased for company fleets, such as cab firms. Sales to private customers dipped by nearly 7% in 2017 after years of growth. While drivers of Britain\u2019s most popular car, the Ford Fiesta, still mostly opt for blue, executive cars in the top 10 such as the Mercedes C-class are resolutely black. Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cPicking a colour is one of the many exciting decisions to make when specifying a new car, as well as selecting from the cutting-edge safety and comfort tech available on the latest low emission vehicles.

      "bodyText": "I once had a stall in the Portobello Road market, when it still had a cheap, rubbishy end where you could find thrilling bargains. My stall was at this fascinating, vibrant end, between a book stall and a bric-a-brac stall, on a pavement forecourt facing the public lavatories. Every Saturday, the bookseller, who also sold cinema ephemera, would leave me in charge and go down to the swanky part of the market, which was crammed with tourists. There he would find his own stock, which dealers had snapped up from his stall early in the morning, to sell at a staggering profit on their own stalls, 10 minutes\u2019 walk away. This was one of my lessons in capitalism \u2013 the trickle-up effect. The bargains were snatched away from the shoppers who loved and needed them, by the ones who didn\u2019t, to be distributed, at a profit, via flashier stalls, to people with fatter wallets, who couldn\u2019t be fagged to walk up the road and take a little trouble searching, or who didn\u2019t want to walk among the riff-raff, or the more vulgar stall-holders. But they needn\u2019t have worried. I only remember one really offensive trader. We called her Mrs Fuck-Pig because that\u2019s what she would shout at any shopper who slightly displeased her. The bookseller didn\u2019t mind the profiteers. He was just curious about them, and his real love was for his stock. He loved searching for it, storing it, wondering at it, chatting about it and selling it at a reasonable price. But I found that I couldn\u2019t always get even a reasonable price for my tailors\u2019 trimmings. I didn\u2019t need much profit. My stock had landed in my lap, bought accidently at auction by my father. But I still didn\u2019t want to throw it away. Here came the second lesson. As it was nearly Christmas, the bric-a-brac lady had found some logs, stuck holly in them and sprayed them silver. They weren\u2019t selling. So what did she do? Doubled the price. They sold like hot cakes. \u201cIf they\u2019re too cheap,\u201d she said, \u201c\u2018people think they\u2019re rubbish, but if they\u2019re expensive, people think they must be good quality, so they cough up.\u201d It worked a treat. I raised my prices, and my mother-of-pearl buttons, bakelite and enamel clasps, herringbone and devor\u00e9 fabrics and other treasures from the 30s and 40s, sold like mad. The trouble is that the swanky end has now spread like a deadening plague because councils don\u2019t like cheap-end markets. They prefer what a developer once determined Covent Garden should be: \u201ca Selfridges without a roof\u201d, and that\u2019s what our street markets are all becoming, like our housing and whole system: nothing much affordable is allowed to circulate at the bottom, everything sucked up to the top. Third lesson: time for a new-style economics. Quickly please.",

As it was nearly Christmas, the bric-a-brac lady had found some logs, stuck holly in them and sprayed them silver. They weren\u2019t selling. So what did she do? Doubled the price. They sold like hot cakes. \u201cIf they\u2019re too cheap,\u201d she said, \u201c\u2018people think they\u2019re rubbish, but if they\u2019re expensive, people think they must be good quality, so they cough up.\u201d It worked a treat. I raised my prices, and my mother-of-pearl buttons, bakelite and enamel clasps, herringbone and devor\u00e9 fabrics and other treasures from the 30s and 40s, sold like mad.</p> <p>The trouble is that the swanky end has now spread like a deadening plague because councils don\u2019t like cheap-end markets. They prefer what a developer once determined Covent Garden should be: <a href=\"https://www.drapersonline.com/news/recreating-covent-garden-as-a-1m-sq-ft-selfridges-without-a-roof/7010050.article\">\u201ca Selfridges without a roof\u201d</a>, and that\u2019s what our street markets are all becoming, like our housing and whole system: nothing much affordable is allowed to circulate at the bottom, everything sucked up to the top. Third lesson: time for a new-style economics. Quickly please.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The construction firm Carillion, which is involved in a host of major government projects including HS2, has gone into compulsory liquidation. What went wrong for Carillion? Carillion relied on large contracts, some of which have proved much less lucrative than it expected. Last year it slashed the value of them by \u00a3845m, of which \u00a3375m related to public-private partnerships (PPPs) such as Royal Liverpool university hospital. As its contracts underperformed, its debts soared to \u00a3900m. The company needed a \u00a3300m cash injection, but the banks that lent it money refused to put more in. The government also refused to bail it out. That left the company unable to continue trading, forcing it to go into liquidation. Why liquidation and not administration? Administration aims to help a company repay debts to avoid insolvency if possible, while liquidation is the process of selling all assets before closing down the company completely. Carillion is likely going straight into liquidation for two reasons. First, it does not even have enough cash to keep trading during an administration process and secondly because the public services run by Carillion need funding from the government to carry on and only the official receiver, who oversees liquidations, can deal with such payments. The Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, has promised an orderly process, avoiding a fire-sale of assets. Shareholders will get nothing. Who is handling the liquidation? David Chapman, a civil servant working for the Insolvency Service, has been appointed as liquidator. He is being advised by six \u201cspecial managers\u201d from accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. They will take over the day-to-day control, selling assets, dealing with creditors\u2019 claims and investigating the cause of failure. The directors will no longer be involved. The costs of the liquidation are paid from the assets. What does it mean for staff? Will they get paid? Government will continue to pay those among Carillion\u2019s 19,500 UK staff who work in public sector jobs, such as NHS cleaners and school catering. But workers who provide services to private-sector firms face having their wages stopped on Wednesday unless another employer steps in. What does it mean for jobs? Up to 43,000 jobs are at risk worldwide at Carillion, including 19,500 in the UK. Some employees will be moved over to other contractors, particularly where they are working on state contracts, such as HS2 and Crossrail. Lidington said some public services would be taken in-house while others would be handed to rivals. Some of Carillion\u2019s small business suppliers are also now at risk, jeopardising more jobs. What does it mean for Carillion trainees? The Construction Industry Training Board said it would step in to secure the future of Carillion\u2019s 1,400 apprentices, offering grant and apprenticeship transfer incentives to other employers. It is hoping to place the first trainees with new employers by Thursday. What happens to the company\u2019s contracts? Lee Causer, of the accountants Moore Stephens, said customers would have clauses in their contracts that allow them to break the deal if Carillion became insolvent. While some customers may have contingency plans, delays in delivering projects appear inevitable, along with disruption in the supply chain. What about subcontractors? They could face big problems. As many as 30,000 small businesses are thought to be owed money by Carillion. Causer of Moore Stephens said: \u201cCarillion\u2019s collapse could trigger a number of insolvencies across the construction sector, in an industry that already experiences the highest levels of insolvency per year in the UK. The ramifications of the failure of Carillion could be huge.\u201d What does it mean for school dinners? The government has promised to provide the cash necessary to maintain public services provided by Carillion staff, subcontractors and suppliers, ranging from school dinners to managing hospital operating theatres and maintaining prisons. Oxfordshire county council put firefighters on standby to ensure local schoolchildren would get fed if Carillion workers didn\u2019t turn up. What will happen to the pension fund? Carillion has 13 pension schemes with a total deficit of \u00a3580m, but the liability will balloon to more than \u00a3800m because the firm no longer has a solvent business behind it. The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) will take over. The PPF has a \u00a36bn surplus, socan cope with this hit. Will pensions be covered in full? People who have already retired will receive their pensions in full, but those yet to retire will see cuts of 10-20%. Higher earners may be affected a PPF cap on payouts, which currently is \u00a334,655.05. However employees with more than 20 years\u2019 service can receive more. The PPF assessment procedure could take months or even years. Where can employees get help? Anyone worried about their pension should ring the Pension Advisory Service (TPAS) on 0300 123 1047 for free guidance. TPAS has also set up a special helpline number for members of Carillion\u2019s pension schemes: 020 7630 2715. Employees can also contact JobCentre Plus through its rapid response service. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Carillion, which managed hundreds of public sector projects and vital public services, collapsed into liquidation after last-ditch rescue talks failed, with a team from accountancy firm PwC drafted in to help manage the process. The government\u2019s Insolvency Service urged Carillion\u2019s 19,500 UK staff to go to work as usual and assured them they would get paid to continue providing services such as school dinners, hospital cleaning and prison maintenance. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said that some of Carillion\u2019s 450 public sector contracts could be taken in house, although that was \u201ca decision for further down the line\u201d. Contracts for building part of the HS2 rail link will remain in the private sector, he added. Kier and Eiffage, the other two construction partners, have assured ministers they can build the London to Birmingham section of the line without Carillion. Other companies said they had already drawn up contingency plans for Carillion\u2019s demise, including the UK\u2019s largest construction firm, Balfour Beatty, which expects to take a \u00a345m hit. The PM\u2019s spokesman described the collapse of Carillion as \u201cvery regrettable\u201d and said that ministers had been monitoring the situation since the company\u2019s profits warning in July. Last-ditch talks with Carillion\u2019s lenders at the weekend collapsed, despite emergency talks at the Cabinet Office, with Whitehall sources saying that the government refused to provide \u00a320m that Carillion had hoped would convince the banks to put in some money. The result was a liquidation process announced on Monday morning, rather than administration, where the business continues to trade while attempts are made to find a buyer. David Birne, the insolvency partner at chartered accountants HW Fisher &amp; Company, said it suggested there was very little of value left within the business. David Chapman, a civil servant working for the Insolvency Service, has been appointed liquidator of Carillion. He is being advised by six \u201cspecial managers\u201d from PwC. They will assume day-to-day control of the company, selling assets, dealing with creditors\u2019 claims and investigating what caused the company\u2019s collapse. Shareholders will not get anything. The firm is involved in many public infrastructure projects \u2013 from transport and health to education and defence \u2013 and provides other vital public services such as cleaning and catering in NHS hospitals, the provision of school dinners in nearly 900 schools, and prison maintenance. It is also the lead contractor on major public-private patnerships such as the unfinished Royal Liverpool University and Metropolitan Midland hospitals. The West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, the former boss of John Lewis, said he had set up a taskforce to assist Carillion suppliers and subcontractors, adding that a new contractor would have to be found for the Metropolitan Midland. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, defended the government\u2019s decision not to bail out the company and pointed to contingency plans drawn up in July. These meant contracts were structured so that if Carillion failed, other contractors would take over its responsibilities. Rehana Azam, national secretary of the GMB union, said: \u201cThe fact such a massive government contractor like Carillion has been allowed to go into administration shows the complete failure of a system that has put our public services in the grip of shady profit-making contractors. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with Carillion yet again shows the perils of allowing privatisation to run rampant in our schools, our hospitals and our prisons.\u201d Labour and the Unite union called for an urgent inquiry into Carillion\u2019s collapse. Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: \u201cGiven \u00a32bn worth of government contracts were awarded in the time three profit warnings were given by Carillion, a serious investigation needs to be launched into the government\u2019s handling of this matter.\u201d Unite also expressed concern about the impact on the wider supply chain, warning that many small firms were now at serious risk of collapse. \u201cPwC must put workers and suppliers at the head of the queue for payment, not the banks and certainly not the Carillion boardroom,\u201d Unite said. Carillion ran into financial difficulties last year after issuing three profit warnings in five months and writing down more than \u00a31bn on the dwindling value of contracts in the UK, Middle East and Canada. It has debts of about \u00a31bn and a \u00a3600m pension deficit, and is being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority over announcements made between December 2016 and July 2017. Payments to those receiving pensions from the firm are expected to continue, albeit at a reduce rate, with the Pension Protection Fund lined up to take on a scheme whose deficit is predicted to balloon to \u00a3800m. Philip Green, the company\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cThis is a very sad day for Carillion, for our colleagues, suppliers and customers that we have been proud to serve over many years. Over recent months huge efforts have been made to restructure Carillion to deliver its sustainable future. \u201cIn recent days, however, we have been unable to secure the funding to support our business plan and it is therefore with the deepest regret that we have arrived at this decision.\u201d \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "webTitle": "Diesel car sales slump puts thousands of jobs at risk in UK", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thousands of jobs in the UK car industry are under threat as diesel vehicle sales slump due to tax increases and negative publicity, experts have warned. According to sources, executives are preparing for redundancies, with the rush to embrace electric vehicles adding to the pressure on diesel. Last year, sales of diesel-powered vehicles in the UK plummeted by 17.1% to just over 1 million. One industry source said the focus on electric, allied to a recent tax increase on diesel cars, poses a serious threat to a vehicle type that accounted for nearly 38% of car sales in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s created a cliff edge for diesel. Diesel should have been phased out and electric phased in. Our government has tightened the noose [with a duty increase on diesel vehicles in the budget]. The government should have realised this was not good for employees. In the short term, it will create unemployment.\u201d The uncertainty created by the death of the diesel engine has already begun to hit home. Last week, Vauxhall announced it was cutting a further 250 jobs at its troubled Ellesmere Port site in Cheshire. The Astra maker had already cut 400 of its 1,800-strong workforce last year. The UK automotive manufacturing industry directly employs 169,000 people. Potential buyers are also shunning diesel vehicles following the so-called \u201cdieselgate\u201d scandal in 2015 when it emerged that Volkswagen had cheated regulators and misled customers by using software to suppress emissions of nitrogen oxide during vehicle tests. Since the scandal broke, industry and politicians have backed electric cars heavily. BMW plans to build a fully electric version of the Mini at its Cowley plant outside Oxford from 2019. Volvo has announced that from the same year, all its new models will have an electric motor. VW has earmarked \u20ac70bn (\u00a362bn) to produce battery-powered versions of all models by 2030. Governments in France, the UK and the Netherlands have also backed plans to ban the sale of diesel and petrol vehicles between 2025 and 2040 in a push to clean up polluted cities. This has left diesel cars in the lurch. There were more dramatic warnings last week that the worst is yet to come for diesel cars. Academics at Aston University predicted they will account for just 15% of the UK market by 2025. Automotive expert Prof David Bailey said diesel\u2019s \u201cslow death\u201d was being driven by environmental pressures, consumer confusion, strict regulations and sinking secondhand values. He added: \u201cDiesel cars face a raft of challenges, each one of which could damage sales, and which are combining to kill off the domestic diesel sector, which was so rattled by the \u2018dieselgate\u2019 scandal.\u201d Aston University expects a further 10% drop in sales this year. Bailey urged the government to set up a scrappage scheme to encourage drivers to switch to electric cars. \u201cNow that it\u2019s clear diesel is dying a slow death, the time is right for the government to take the initiative and offer up scrappage benefits to those who are prepared to ditch their diesels and switch to electric cars,\u201d he said. Prof Karel Williams at Manchester University noted the car sector was battling on three fronts. \u201cThe industry is desperately trying to keep cashflow going to invest in new electric models but there are three things against them in the UK. First, the industry has been lying about emissions; second, there is the diesel sales issue, which is Europe-wide; third, there is Brexit,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe industry is quite desperate. If you put together these problems, I think it\u2019s inevitable that jobs will go.\u201d Another industry source agreed: \u201cThere is a sense of alarm about this issue. People have made fine declarations (about cutting diesel to go electric), but the implementation is going to be painful.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Labour has called on the government to explain why it awarded contracts worth nearly \u00a32bn to Carillion even after it became clear the company was in financial distress. The construction and outsourcing group issued the first of three warnings about its financial health in July, in an update that sent its share price tumbling and forced its chief executive to step down. The shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, pointed to regulations showing Carillion could have been designated \u201chigh risk\u201d at that point, and he called on the government to explain what measures it had taken to check the firm was ready for more taxpayer-funded work. Trickett said: \u201cAlarm bells have been ringing for over six months about the state of Carillion\u2019s finances, so the government must come forward and answer questions on exactly what due diligence measures were undertaken before awarding contracts to Carillion worth billions of taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d Carillion issued its first profit warning on 10 July, issuing a statement that sent its shares tumbling 39% and triggered the resignation of its chief executive Richard Howson. A week later a joint venture between Carillion, its construction rival Kier and the French civil engineer Eiffage won a \u00a31.4bn contract to work on the HS2 high-speed rail link. The day after that, on 18 July, Carillion won a \u00a3158m contract from the Ministry of Defence to provide \u201ccatering, retail and leisure, together with hotel and mess services\u201d at 233 military facilities. A second profit warning in September was followed five weeks later by the award from Network Rail of a contract to electrify the London-to-Corby rail line. A week afterwards the company put out a third profit warning, only to be awarded a \u00a312m schools building contract three days later. The interim chief executive, Keith Cochrane, said the award showed \u201cwe continue to retain the confidence of key customers despite the group\u2019s current challenges\u201d. If a supplier to the government shows signs of financial distress, which include issuing a profit warning, the Cabinet Office can deem the company high risk. At that stage, according to government documents, a \u201ccrown representative\u201d should be appointed to work with the company on improving its performance. Government policy also states that officials \u201cshould reduce where possible the extent to which the strategic supplier is given additional work under the terms of an existing contract [...] so as to contain the risk to the taxpayer\u201d. Cabinet Office records show that no crown representative had been appointed as of September 2017, two months after Carillion\u2019s first profit warning. Trickett will ask the government to explain what due diligence it applied to Carillion after its first profit warning and which ministers were involved in decisions to keep awarding contracts despite its financial problems. Labour called on the government to be ready to take back public contracts awarded to Carillion to ensure workers do not lose their jobs and that public sector projects involving Carillion \u2013 such as the Midland Metropolitan hospital and Royal Liverpool hospital \u2013 are not interrupted. Trickett said: \u201cIn the meantime \u2013 as emergency meetings take place between officials \u2013 employees of Carillion, pension holders and taxpayers will want assurances that financial protections are in place in the event the supplier experiencing further financial difficulties. \u201cLabour urges the government to stand ready to intervene and bring these crucial public sector contracts back in-house. The government cannot outsource its responsibility and duty of care to these workers and vital public sector projects.\u201d Labour is also expected to highlight the links between the government and the Carillion chairman, Philip Green, who is an adviser to the prime minister on corporate responsibility. In 2015 he signed an open letter advising people to vote Conservative. Stella Creasy, the Walthamstow MP who has campaigned against PFI (private finance initiative) contracts where private firms are contracted to carry out public sector work, hopes to raise the case of Carillion with the Treasury in the House of Commons on Monday. She expressed particular concern about the firm\u2019s contracts to build hospitals in Liverpool and Smethwick. While the Cabinet Office has been coordinating the contingency planning for a possible collapse of the company, Creasy insisted the Treasury should not escape responsibility. \u201cCarillion is one of a handful of companies who have taken on private finance contracts with the public sector for major infrastructure projects,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Treasury has previously argued that using these contracts, which are a more expensive form of credit for the costs of building and maintaining infrastructure than public sector borrowing, are a way of transferring the risks arising from major projects to the private sector. \u201cThe problems facing Carillion therefore also raise concerns about the financial stability of the other contractors and whether the public sector may face risks from this as a result.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Construction firm Carillion is hoping for an eleventh-hour rescue to save it from collapse amid fears for the future of a host of major government projects and day-to-day services, from schools to hospitals, prisons and the army. The Cabinet Office hosted emergency talks on Sunday aimed at mapping out a future for a company that employs 43,000 people \u2013 including nearly 20,000 in the UK \u2013 but the meeting broke up without a rescue deal being announced. The company\u2019s bank lenders were considering a last-ditch appeal to fund a rescue plan, according to Sky News, but accountancy firm EY is standing ready to manage a potential administration process, which could be triggered as soon as Monday morning. Labour called for a public inquiry into the rapid decline of Carillion, whose chairman is an adviser to the prime minister on \u201ccorporate responsibility\u201d and signed an open letter in 2015 from business figures urging people to vote Conservative. Trade unions branded Carillion a \u201ctextbook example of the failures of privatisation\u201d and urged the government to step in to guarantee jobs and services. Opposition MPs are expected to question the government on Monday on why it awarded Carillion lucrative public sector contracts, including \u00a31.4bn of work on the HS2 rail project, even after it became clear the company was struggling. The government has insisted it has contingency plans to protect vital public services provided by Carillion, such as cleaning and catering in NHS hospitals, the provision of school dinners in nearly 230 schools and prison maintenance. Some of the Wolverhampton-based company\u2019s partners on multimillion-pound projects have been primed to take over the firm\u2019s share of their joint-venture contracts. Thousands of staff could be transferred to new employers under transfer of undertakings (TUPE) regulations that preserve staff pay and conditions when a business changes hands. The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) is also on alert to take on the multiple pension schemes, which have 28,500 members and a \u00a3580m deficit which, experts predict, could balloon to \u00a3800m if the firm collapses. Carillion stunned the City of London by issuing a profit warning in July, an announcement that sent its shares tumbling 39% and prompted the resignation of chief executive Richard Howson, who earned \u00a31.5m in pay and bonuses in 2016. It has since downgraded its profit forecasts twice more. Four months ago, it reported a \u00a31.15bn loss for just six months, after taking hits of more than \u00a31bn on unprofitable contracts. Its bank lenders \u2013 including HSBC, Barclays and Santander \u2013 are unwilling to inject more money without a government bailout for a company with debts of \u00a3900m and whose stockmarket value is just \u00a361m. Three years ago, Carillion was valued at \u00a31.6bn. The Cabinet office minister, David Lidington, has been leading the crisis talks, assisted by the civil service chief executive, John Manzoni, a former board member at BP. The pair are thought to have told Carillion not to expect a taxpayer-funded bailout, sending executives back to the company\u2019s banks in the hope they would offer a lifeline. The shadow Cabinet office minister, Jon Trickett, demanded a public inquiry, pointing to regulations that call for government officials to step in when companies providing public services are performing badly. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, urged his opposite number, Jeremy Hunt, to make a public statement to guarantee that hospital services would not be affected. Fellow Labour MP Stella Creasy said the affair raised concerns about other public-private contracts, which she said were a \u201cway of transferring the risks arising from major projects to the private sector\u201d. Trade unions called on Downing Street to reassure workers and the public. \u201cThere are not only thousands of jobs on the line here,\u201d said the GMB national secretary, Rehana Azam. \u201cCrucial services that hundreds of thousands of people rely on every day are at immediate risk. \u201cThe prime minister must stop dithering and delaying, and immediately launch a taskforce bringing together employers and unions to safeguard these vital jobs and services. The TUC deputy general secretary, Paul Nowak, said Carillion was a \u201ctextbook example of the failures of privatisation and outsourcing\u201d. As well as managing services across education, the NHS, the prison service \u2013 and working on transport projects \u2013 Carillion is a major contractor building the Midland Metropolitan and Royal Liverpool University hospitals. The new Liverpool hospital, a \u00a3335m flagship development which is unfinished and overdue, is among projects that have caused problems for the company. One former banker with experience of similar public-private partnership contracts warned that the government may have limited legal powers to intervene to ensure these two projects were not severely disrupted. He said costs were now likely to escalate. \u201cMy experience in work-outs of this kind is that the cost of completion spirals out of control,\u201d he said. \u201cAny replacement construction company will immediately declare that half of what has been done so far is defective and \u2018you might as well start from scratch\u2019.\u201d Independent pension expert John Ralfe said that the pension deficit was likely to swell to \u00a3800m when it is valued for the purposes of the PPF. \u201cThe good news is that the 28,000 Carillion pension scheme members would receive PPF compensation \u2013 around 85% of the pension promise end-to-end \u2013 and the PPF surplus is big enough to cope,\u201d he said. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here. \u2022This article was amended on Thursday 18 January.
