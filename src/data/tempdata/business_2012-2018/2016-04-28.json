      "bodyText": "Richard Caring, the restaurateur and clothing tycoon, has emerged as one of the major beneficiaries of generous dividends paid by BHS in the early days of Sir Philip Green\u2019s ownership. The Guardian has established that Caring, the owner of The Ivy and Le Caprice, was handed \u00a393m in payouts from the retailer, which fell into administration this week \u2013 his share of more than \u00a3422m in dividends paid to shareholders including the Green family. Green is facing widespread criticism over the extraction of more than \u00a3586m in dividends, interest on loans and rental income from BHS over the 15 years he led the business. Two parliamentary committees are looking into how BHS, which was sold for \u00a31 by Green a year ago, ended up with a \u00a3571m pension deficit and \u00a31.3bn of debts. The bulk of the money extracted from BHS came in dividends that were shared among three major shareholders \u2013 the Green family, Caring and Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter \u2013 between 2002 and 2004. The Green family-controlled Global Textiles Investments collected more than \u00a3306m in dividends. It is understood the family took a tax-free payment of just over \u00a3280m, paid to Green\u2019s wife Tina, who is based in Monaco. The rest of the payout to GTI was split between BHS management and bankers including Robin Saunders, the American dealmaker once known as the \u201cqueen of the City of London\u201d. Caring, who was once a close friend of Green and a major supplier to his fashion empire, held a beneficial interest in a 22.1% stake in BHS Group, the former holding company of the retailer, after helping Green fund a \u00a3200m buyout in 2000. Hunter, who made his fortune by selling his Sports Division chain to JJB Sports 1998 and has also owned stakes in Wyevale garden centres, the Office footwear chain and House of Fraser, had a 5.3% stake in BHS from which he earned \u00a322m in dividends. Caring sold his interest in the company in 2006 and Hunter in 2009, when BHS was taken over by the Arcadia Group, which is also controlled by Tina Green. But the multimillionaires collected cash from each of the three major dividend payments made by BHS in the early noughties - helping them go on to fund a string of other deals. Caring\u2019s stake in BHS was held via two British Virgin Islands based entities, Dar Jenna and Lineman Holdings, which meant his involvement, while widely rumoured in the fashion industry, was only confirmed by the Guardian last year by leaks from HSBC\u2019s Swiss private bank. Caring is a UK-born citizen, has a London mansion known as the \u201cVersailles of Hampstead\u201d, and claims hereditary non-domicile tax status thanks to the US origins of his father, a former GI who settled in London after the war. This quirk enabled Caring not to disclose the existence of his Swiss or Monaco accounts to the UK tax authorities, and legally to avoid taxes on his capital held there. But, while his payments from BHS were paid to companies based in a tax haven, Caring, who is worth \u00a3700m according to the Sunday Times Rich List, insists that he paid \u00a333m UK tax on dividends he received from BHS. Hunter held his stake via investment vehicle West Coast Capital, which is based in Ayrshire, and paid full UK tax on the dividends. The payments to shareholders were made at a time when BHS was comfortably profitable, making around \u00a3100m a year. The pension fund was in surplus in the year to March 2002, when shareholders received a \u00a3166.5m dividend. But the difference between the fund\u2019s assets and liabilities had slumped to a pre-tax deficit of nearly \u00a377m by March 2003 and just over \u00a380m the following year. By 2008, the last year before BHS was bought out by the Green family\u2019s Taveta Investments \u2013 which already owned Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and the rest of the Arcadia group \u2013 the pension was back in surplus. Hunter had almost no involvement in the running of BHS, but Caring was one of the group\u2019s major suppliers and a close friend of Green. Industry insiders saw Caring as a key player at BHS in the early noughties, although he was never on the board. It was after BHS was absorbed into Taveta, and the outlook for the pension fund\u2019s equity investments deteriorated in the wake of the financial crash, that the pension deficit soared. By 2009 it stood at \u00a3137.9m. In that year BHS agreed to inject additional contributions of \u00a32.5m, rising to \u00a37.3m in 2012, when trustees set out a 23-year recovery plan for the deficit. A letter to the Guardian from Caring\u2019s law firm, Carter-Ruck, said: \u201cOur client invested in BHS in 2001, and he received dividends of \u00a393m between 2002 and 2004. Our client disposed of all his interest in BHS in November 2006. During the entire period of our client\u2019s shareholdings, BHS traded profitably, and two years after our client divested his shareholdings, BHS\u2019s pension fund was in surplus.\u201d Green\u2019s Arcadia Group also wrote off \u00a3200m of a charge over BHS assets as part of the takeover deal with its most recent owner, Retail Acquisitions. Arcadia retained a further \u00a340m of inter-company debt which is likely to be written off. It also left \u00a365m of cash in the business, later increased to \u00a374m, as well as about \u00a3100m of freehold and long leaseholds. Arcadia also agreed to pay \u00a35m a year into the pension fund over three years. Frank Field MP, chairman of the parliamentary work and pensions committee, which has called on Green to attend an inquiry into the problems of BHS\u2019s pension fund, said: \u201cOne of the major tasks both committees will be concerned with is the amount of money that left the firm during the Green stewardship and with whom did the money end up. When we trace the money we\u2019ll have some important questions to ask.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If you think pay in top boardrooms in the UK has reached insane levels, try Germany, and specifically Volkswagen. After the huge emissions scandal, which could end up costing the firm a few tens of billions of dollars, the car maker\u2019s supervisory board thought hard about pay and decided to carry on almost as if nothing had happened. Actually, that\u2019s too generous. VW\u2019s remuneration report reveals little evidence of any debate. The only glancing reference to the scandal is when the board says it accepted last week\u2019s offer by management to withhold 30% of their performance-related pay. No explanation is offered for why 30% \u2013 and not 100% \u2013 was deemed appropriate. Add it all up and the VW board is barely less expensive than in 2014, when the company was still regarded as a beacon of engineering excellence. The 2015 tally was \u20ac63m; the previous year\u2019s was \u20ac70m. Martin Winterkorn \u2013 the chief executive who resigned and thus \u201ctook responsibility for the irregularities\u201d \u2013 got a \u20ac9.3m termination payment on top of a bonus-heavy \u20ac7.3m pay package. This is staggering when you remember that VW hasn\u2019t even explained yet how 11m of its cars came to be fitted with cheat devices. The much-delayed report is still delayed. In the meantime, shareholders are offered morsels about \u201ca group of persons whose identity is still being determined\u201d modifying software. Should the highly paid management have known what was under the bonnet? That crucial question is ignored. Even when the US clean transportation agency raised questions in May 2014 \u2013 more than a year before the scandal broke \u2013 VW reports that discrepancies were regarded as \u201ca technical problem that did not basically differ from other everyday technical problems at an automotive company\u201d. Is that supposed to excuse inaction? Governance at public companies in the UK is riddled with complacency and conflicts of interest but it is hard to believe a FTSE 100 company, in similar circumstances, would get away with a remuneration report as supine as Volkswagen\u2019s. Even some banking bosses were obliged to surrender their bonuses occasionally as their share prices crashed. At Volkswagen, it seems, restoring trust \u2013 the stock phrase that has trotted out since last September \u2013 means preserving boardroom pay. Weir Group\u2019s gamble on remuneration fails to pay off What Volkswagen needs is some shareholders like Weir Group\u2019s. A 72% vote against a pay policy sends a suitably robust message. This is a rare example of a board losing a binding vote on a forward-looking policy. Weirdly, however, it is possible to have an ounce of sympathy for Weir. Its pay committee seems to have recognised that standard long-term incentive plans, or LTIPs, often turn out to be farcical. They can end up rewarding mediocrity and rely heavily on chance factors, like competitors failing or the oil price rising. In place of an LTIP, Weir opted for \u201crestricted stock\u201d \u2013 essentially, just handing the executives a pile of shares and inviting them to maximise the value. It\u2019s how the American companies do it, and Weir argued it hires a lot of Americans for its operations there. The problem with restricted stock, of course, is that they come with no performance conditions attached. The only safeguard against rewarding failure is the willingness of the pay committee to apply common sense. That ingredient seems to have enraged UK shareholders, who have sent a clear message that they do not want an import from the US. But what do they want? The Investment Association, representing \u00a35.5tn of institutional money, wrote a blistering report last week saying the current approach to pay at UK listed companies is \u201cnot fit for purpose.\u201d It recommended a move away from \u201cone-size fits all\u201d thinking and even mentioned restricted stock for special cases. But the first company to try it has lost. The deep problems here are the sheer size of modern pay packages and the fact that nobody trusts remuneration committees to claw back awards. Weir won\u2019t overcome those concerns in a hurry. It has landed itself in a fine mess \u2013 but it\u2019s not entirely of its own making. No pot of gold in sight for RBS\u2019s Project Rainbow branch sell-off Royal Bank of Scotland was asking for trouble when it used the name Project Rainbow to describe the plan to sell 300 branches under the orders of the European commission. As with real rainbows, the end is eternally glimpsed but never attained. The latest delay comes two and half years after RBS revived an old brand \u2013 Williams &amp; Glyn \u2013 and asserted it would be seen on high streets \u201csoon\u201d. The latest dispatch says there is a \u201csignificant risk\u201d that the legal deadline for separation or sale by December 2017 will be missed. The plea is complexity \u2013 again. The rewiring job doesn\u2019t sound easy and, to be fair to RBS, it is attempting a stiffer task than Lloyds Banking Group did in similar circumstances with TSB. All the same, it\u2019s ridiculous how long this is taking. RBS, having been told to sell in October 2009, may take eight years to shed 300 branches. It took the Americans the same time to put a man on the moon after JFK\u2019s \u201cby the end of the decade\u201d speech in 1961.",

This is a rare example of a board <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/28/shareholder-rebellions-shire-pay-agm-ceo-investor-anger\">losing a binding vote</a> on a forward-looking policy.</p> <p>Weirdly, however, it is possible to have an ounce of sympathy for Weir. Its pay committee seems to have recognised that standard long-term incentive plans, or LTIPs, often turn out to be farcical. They can end up rewarding mediocrity and rely heavily on chance factors, like competitors failing or the oil price rising.</p> <p>In place of an LTIP, Weir opted for \u201crestricted stock\u201d \u2013 essentially, just handing the executives a pile of shares and inviting them to maximise the value. It\u2019s how the American companies do it, and Weir argued it hires a lot of Americans for its operations there.</p> <p>The problem with restricted stock, of course, is that they come with no performance conditions attached. The only safeguard against rewarding failure is the willingness of the pay committee to apply common sense. That ingredient seems to have enraged UK shareholders, who have sent a clear message that they do not want an import from the US.</p> <p>But what do they want? The Investment Association, representing \u00a35.5tn of institutional money, wrote a blistering report last week saying the current approach to pay at UK listed companies is \u201cnot fit for purpose.\u201d It recommended a move away from \u201cone-size fits all\u201d thinking and even mentioned restricted stock for special cases. But the first company to try it has lost.</p> <p>The deep problems here are the sheer size of modern pay packages and the fact that nobody trusts remuneration committees to claw back awards. Weir won\u2019t overcome those concerns in a hurry. It has landed itself in a fine mess \u2013 but it\u2019s not entirely of its own making.</p> <h2>No pot of gold in sight for RBS\u2019s Project Rainbow branch sell-off</h2> <p>Royal Bank of Scotland was asking for trouble when it used the name Project Rainbow to describe the plan to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/01/rbs-applies-for-banking-licence-for-williams-glyn-spin-off\">sell 300 branches</a> under the orders of the European commission. As with real rainbows, the end is eternally glimpsed but never attained.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/28/rbs-admits-delays-offloading-williams-and-glyn\">latest delay</a> comes two and half years after RBS revived an old brand \u2013 Williams &amp; Glyn \u2013 and asserted it would be seen on high streets \u201csoon\u201d. The latest dispatch says there is a \u201csignificant risk\u201d that the legal deadline for separation or sale by December 2017 will be missed. The plea is complexity \u2013 again.</p> <p>The rewiring job doesn\u2019t sound easy and, to be fair to RBS, it is attempting a stiffer task than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/25/lloyds-bank-tsb-share-sale\">Lloyds Banking Group did in similar circumstances with TSB</a>. All the same, it\u2019s ridiculous how long this is taking. RBS, having been told to sell in October 2009, may take eight years to shed 300 branches. It took the Americans the same time to put a man on the moon after JFK\u2019s \u201cby the end of the decade\u201d speech in 1961.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boardroom bosses have received stinging rebukes over pay, with the engineering group Weir forced to abandon potential share awards for its top management team and Shire Pharmaceuticals failing to get a majority of investors to support its pay deals. On a dramatic day in the annual general meeting season, the building materials group CRH also suffered a 40% vote against its pay policies as investors showed a renewed willingness to protest against large pay deals in scenes reminiscent of the 2012 shareholders\u2019 spring. Weir, a FTSE 250 company, suffered the biggest embarrassment with 72.4% of investors voting against its pay policy, one of the largest rebellions since shareholders were given a \u201csay on pay\u201d in 2013. The vote on pay deals for the next three years is binding, unlike the report on the previous year\u2019s pay, which is advisory. Sarah Wilson, the chief executive of the advisory group Manifest, said: \u201cThis is one of the most significant voting results of all time.\u201d It builds on the defiant mood in which the AGM season started earlier this month when there were no votes at two FTSE 100 companies, BP and Smith &amp; Nephew, on the same day. Rebellions also continued at FTSE 100 companies on Thursday. At the Dublin-based Shire, an advisory pay vote squeezed through with only 50.5% in favour of a 25% salary rise for CEO Flemming \u00d8rnskov to $1.7m (\u00a31.2m). If deliberate abstentions were included, support fell to just below 50%. At CRH a 40% vote against its pay policy was not binding because the company is also based in Ireland. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, a corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management, said: \u201cThis year has seen a \u2018spring of discontent\u2019 for a number of major British companies, with shareholders demonstrating their unhappiness at the remuneration packages awarded to top executives last year at a time when company performance was lacklustre at best.\u201d Weir is now going back to the drawing board to devise new bonus schemes for its senior executives, including its chief executive, Keith Cochrane. It had wanted to award Cochrane up to 165% of his \u00a3750,000 salary in shares, but while this was less than the 250% he currently stands to receive, there were no performance criteria to qualify for the award. Weir had argued it needed to change its pay deals because of its exposure to volatile commodity markets. Shire, meanwhile, insisted its chief executive had presided over stellar performance at the drug maker. CRH said it would \u201ccontact individual shareholders to more fully understand their perspectives, as appropriate\u201d. On a day in which more than 25 London-listed companies held their annual meetings, Schroders shareholders registered their frustration with the fund management group\u2019s elevation of Michael Dobson from chief executive to chairman. Nearly 15% voted against his re-election, and almost 12% voted against Lord Howard, the senior independent director who oversaw the move. Hermes, which represents pension funds and had urged other investors to oppose Dobson\u2019s promotion, voted against both. It is a sizeable protest vote, given that the Schroder family owns 48% of the shares. Howard told shareholders the company, whose own fund managers exercise votes on pay, was aware that it was breaching the corporate governance code, but defended the promotion. \u201cWe thought he was such a good and such an obvious candidate,\u201d he said. At the estate agents Countrywide, there was a 20% vote against pay while Barclays faced criticism of its pay, culture, the cut to its dividend and any possible links to the Panama Papers \u2013 although at the end of the long meeting it escaped a rebellion over pay with a 6% protest vote. The bank\u2019s chairman, John McFarlane, told investors he was taking personal responsibility for restoring its fortunes after cutting the dividend for 2016 and 2017 and putting its once coveted African operations up for sale. Michael Mason-Mahon, a familiar face at many major companies\u2019 AGMs, urged McFarlane not to sell Barclays\u2019 Africa operations to the bank\u2019s former chief executive Bob Diamond, who said earlier this week he had funding in place to consider making an offer. \u201cI\u2019d rather take a lollipop from the devil himself,\u201d Mason-Mahon said. Another regular attendee, John Farmer, drew applause from other shareholders when he said bankers\u2019 pay was out of control and out of kilter. McFarlane insisted the bank had cut bonuses and was not paying as highly as rivals, although one shareholder was not impressed at being told the bonus pool was \u00a31.6bn compared with \u00a31.1bn to go to shareholders. \u201cYou got more than we did,\u201d they said. \u201cI take full personal responsibility for the situation of the company, as does the board. The issue is ours to fix, and fix it we will. It does though leave a great deal to do,\u201d McFarlane said. Barclays\u2019 chief executive, Jes Staley, who spent much of his career at JP Morgan, addressed shareholders after five months in the role. \u201cYou have been patient long enough,\u201d he said. \u201cLike you I am a Barclays shareholder,\u201d he said, pledging to increase the dividend \u201cover time\u201d. He added: \u201cI want to help to restore our profession to the esteem and respect that it enjoyed when I first joined it, esteem and respect that I certainly feel for my colleagues in Barclays as I see the way in which they serve our customers and clients every day.\u201d As the Barclays AGM drew to a close, the Competition and Markets Authority revealed the bank had written to 10,000 customers with payment protection insurance to apologise after it failed to send them annual statements telling them how much they were spending on their policies and outlining their rights to cancel them.",

      "bodyText": "Prem Sikka (Opinion, 26 April) is right that BHS is a victim, but not of shareholder greed \u2013 rather director greed and flawed legislation. In the early 1980s most corporate pension funds had sizeable surpluses. As an accountant at the time, I argued that pension funds should be ringfenced, but I lost the argument on the grounds that companies had a liability to pay their defined pensions. So companies took \u201cholidays\u201d and in some cases raided the pension pot, and we all know what happened. But it is getting worse; corporate greed is becoming out of control. For example, BP has awarded its CEO a huge amount despite incurring huge losses. Then to get shareholders off the scent it maintained the dividend (this strategy didn\u2019t work), but had to borrow more money to pay it. A simple corporate governance strategy would be to make it illegal to pay directors\u2019 bonuses unless the company pays a dividend, and to make it illegal to pay a dividend unless the company makes a profit or has the cash to pay out of reserves. Malcolm Howard Banstead, Surrey \u2022 Company law does indeed need urgent reform. Plc shareholders have a massive advantage over other business models \u2013 they can walk away from their creditors virtually unscathed. This privilege should bear a price and should come only with responsibilities to a wider audience than shareholders themselves, including the public. The early debates about limited liability in the 19th century were concerned about the possibilities that this opened up for fraud and other shady business practices. This highly privileged status should only be granted to companies that display the highest ethical standards and the law should reflect this. This is even more urgent given the emergence of flash trading and the increase in insider dealing over recent years. Roy Boffy Walsall, West Midlands \u2022 I am reminded by Professor Sikka\u2019s article of a final interview I had in 1961 when I applied for a management traineeship with the then Imperial Tobacco Company (Imps). I was told by its deputy chairman that if I were offered a job I should not accept it if I believed that the company was beholden only to its shareholders. Imps had obligations to the wholesalers and retailers that sold its goods, to its customers, to the local communities in which it had factories, offices and depots and to its employees. To this last body of stakeholders, as they would now be called, it had a duty of care that extended into retirement. For that reason it maintained one of the soundest pension funds in Britain. On top of that, in the WD &amp; HO Wills branch of Imps, we employed full-time liaison officers who visited pensioners wherever they lived in the UK and were empowered to offer immediate assistance if it were needed. Hanson Trust, focused exclusively on shareholder value, acquired Imperial Group plc in 1986 with consequences for the pension fund which took legal action to resolve. Its view of employing people to watch over our pensioners can be guessed at. John Smith Lindfield, West Sussex \u2022 In your coverage of the collapse of BHS you refer to the pension scheme potentially being rescued by the government-sponsored Pension Protection Fund (Downfall of the high-street king, G2, 27 April). The Pension Protection Fund, while set up by statute under the Pensions Act of 2004, does not derive funding from government. It is supported via levy-raising powers with the levy payable by all the other eligible pension schemes. So if the BHS scheme is taken into the protection fund, and after the wind-up there is a deficit, this will be funded by all the other protection-scheme eligible pension funds in the UK. Mark Austin Horsmonden, Kent \u2022 I read your article in G2 about Philip Green without any surprise. His modus operandi is well established. Robert Peston, in his book Who Runs Britain? (published in 2008) devoted a chapter to Green entitled The King of Jackpot Capitalism. The chapter analyses the effect such predatory business practices have, not just on employees, but also on the rest of us. Suggested reading for the select committee, perhaps? Or, indeed, the business secretary, when he has a spare moment. Veronica Puddicombe Plymouth \u2022 On the day that we read that Philip Green\u2019s family \u201cbanked monster cheques, including \u00a31.2bn from Topshop owner Arcadia\u201d and that because Green\u2019s wife, Tina, \u201cis a Monaco resident, no UK income tax was due on the \u00a31.2bn payout\u201d; we also read that \u201cmore than a million people in Britain are so poor that they could not afford to eat properly, keep clean or stay warm\u201d (Study says more than 1m people destitute, 27 April). Might these two events be linked in any way? Cathy Wood Chiselborough, Somerset \u2022 I would like to explain the main reason for the sad downfall of BHS. As one who feels responsible for this disaster, I should explain that I was an enthusiastic customer for a variety of needs for 70 years. When I read about the financial arrangements made by Philip Green to channel his profits to his wife living overseas I decided I would no longer patronise his business. The calamitous situation for the 11,000 employees may have been brought about, not just because of online shopping, but through other long-term customers making the same decision as me. I am hoping that the right thing will be done to restore the pension funds. Mollie Holden Westgate-on-Sea, Kent \u2022 The main lesson to be learned from BHS is that all workers should be able to pay into a national pension scheme underwritten by the government just as MPs, civil servants, doctors and teachers do, rather than have to rely on employer schemes which can evidently collapse at any time. This is by no means the first time it has happened. Dr Richard Turner Harrogate, North Yorkshire \u2022 In the 2011 riots, a young man with no criminal record was jailed for six months for stealing bottles of water worth \u00a33.50 from a shop. Philip Green and Dominic Chappell have taken hundreds of millions from BHS (How Philip Green\u2019s family emerged as \u00a3580m winners, 26 April). Andrew Sayer (Author of Why We Can\u2019t Afford the Rich), Lancaster \u2022 \u00a3571m hole in BHS pension fund. \u00a3586m banked by \u201cSir\u201d Philip Green and family in dividends etc. There you go.

    "webTitle": "I should have gone to Tata Steel meeting in India, says Sajid Javid", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sajid Javid has admitted that he should have gone to Mumbai for a crucial Tata Steel board meeting that led to the Indian company announcing it would pull out of the UK. The business secretary told MPs that with the benefit of hindsight he should have travelled to India last month, instead of going to Australia on a business trip with his daughter. Javid was lambasted by MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee during a fiery hearing on Thursday over his handling of the steel crisis. Iain Wright, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said it was an \u201cabsolute disgrace\u201d that the business secretary allowed a steelworks in Teesside to close last year. However, Javid hit back, saying: \u201cIt is easy to make those statements, but we have to deal with the reality, the facts.\u201d About 40,000 jobs are at risk after Tata Steel announced last month that it planned to withdraw from its UK operations, including the Port Talbot steelworks. Javid said he had known from mid-February that Tata was considering closing the Welsh plant, but admitted he was shocked by the Indian company\u2019s announcement after the board meeting in March because of the speed with which it wanted to offload the UK business. Despite admitting that with hindsight he would have gone to Mumbai, the MP for Bromsgrove also defended his absence, saying: \u201cA photo opportunity would not have helped the workers. What has helped is the work we have done since.\u201d He added: \u201cI will do everything in my power to help, but that is all I can do. I cannot change the price of steel globally. This is a big economic challenge for the country. I don\u2019t want to live in a country where we have to import all our steel. \u201cFor the thousands of steelworkers and their families and friends affected by this, the message is that we are doing everything we can.\u201d The committee also heard a warning from Tata Steel UK\u2019s chief executive that Britain faced an \u201ceconomic and social disaster\u201d if the pension issues that faced company could not be solved and a buyer not found. Bimlendra Jha told MPs there would be \u201cvery bad consequences for the taxpayer\u201d if the pension liabilities of almost \u00a315bn were not dealt with. Jha said the company had set no fixed deadline to find a buyer, amid concerns that there might not be enough time to find a saviour. However, he warned that Tata \u201ccannot continue to bleed\u201d and that there remained \u201cserious questions marks about the viability of Port Talbot\u201d. Jha said solving the pension problem was key to finding a buyer. Tata Steel has been pumping more than \u00a3100m a year into the pension scheme to fund its liabilities. The scheme could enter the state-backed Pension Protection Fund. \u201cIf we don\u2019t solve it we are staring at some very bad consequences for the taxpayer. We are staring at a huge economic and social disaster,\u201d he added. However, he also opened the door to Tata Steel keeping the business if it could narrow losses at the UK arm, which are believed to be about \u00a31m a day. \u201cWe would not be selling the business if we were not losing money,\u201d said Jha, adding that the UK had structural weaknesses around energy prices and business rates. The Tata boss said the company did not want to split up its UK business by selling it to different buyers. He warned that splitting off Port Talbot would cause damage to the pension scheme because more than 4,000 workers would stop making contributions. \u201cWe would not deal with somebody saying leave alone Port Talbot and give us the rest. That is not a solution that\u2019s acceptable,\u201d Jha said. Javid insisted there was not \u201ca big risk to the public purse\u201d from the pension liabilities, although he did admit they were putting off buyers. He admitted that the government was looking for solutions for the pension scheme, with talks under way between trustees of the British Steel Pension Scheme and the Pensions Regulator. \u201cA number of the potential buyers have said that \u2018we won\u2019t have much interest if we have to take over the current pension plan as it is\u2019,\u201d he told MPs. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big plan, it\u2019s expensive compared to today\u2019s plans and it\u2019s not unreasonable for many buyers to say: \u2018Look we\u2019re interested in the assets but this would be an issue.\u2019\u201d Javid, who has said the government is willing to take a 25% state in the steel business alongside a buyer, said he believed Tata was a \u201cresponsible\u201d seller despite the tight timeframe. One of the potential buyers is a management buy-out backed by Welsh consortium including billionaire Sir Terry Matthews. It is understood the consortium plans to call itself \u201cExcalibur\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The Volkswagen boss who resigned over the German carmaker\u2019s diesel emissions scandal is to walk away with \u20ac16.6m (\u00a313m) before tax. The German automotive company said 12 current and former board members will share \u20ac63m in pay for 2015, even after agreeing to a voluntary reduction in their salaries. Their pay deals include performance-related bonuses worth \u20ac35m for 2015, a year in which the company set aside \u20ac16.2bn to cover the cost of the emissions affair. Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive who resigned after it emerged that 11m of its cars were fitted with defeat devices to manipulate emissions data, was also handed a termination payment worth \u20ac9.3m. The golden goodbye came on top of a \u20ac7.3m salary package for 2015, of which \u20ac5.9m relates to his performance for the year in which the scandal broke and led VW to a \u20ac4.1bn loss. Volkswagen has faced criticism in Germany for handing out any bonuses at all, a decision described as a \u201cslap in the face\u201d by Herbert Behrens, regional head of the leftwing party Die Linke in the carmaker\u2019s home state of Lower Saxony. Speaking at VW\u2019s annual investor conference, Winterkorn\u2019s replacement, Matthias M\u00fcller, said he had apologised personally for the emissions scandal to Barack Obama, during the US president\u2019s state visit to Germany. \u201cWe know that we have disappointed many people \u2014 people who have placed their trust in Volkswagen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stand by our responsibility. And we are doing everything in our power to regain trust.\u201d He added that VW would make a big push into electric cars, with 20 new models to be unveiled by 2020. The company has negotiated a compensation deal in the US, under which drivers will be offered money for the impact on the value of their vehicle. But M\u00fcller said no such deal would be forthcoming in Europe, where looser requirements on diesel emissions mean less work needs to be done on affected vehicles. Dr Hans-Christoph Hirt, co-head of Hermes EOS \u2013 the stewardship arm of fund manager Hermes Investment Management \u2013 said: \u201cThere are some very serious questions under investigations, also with regard to the role of the management board. \u201cIn these circumstances, the management board should not accept any bonus at all for 2015. \u201cThey should wait for the outcome of the investigation. In the absence of them voluntarily coming to that conclusion, the supervisory board chairman should have resolved it behind the scenes. \u201cThey should have recognised that shareholders have lost a lot of money and employees face losing their jobs. It shows the lack of sensitivity that exists in Volkswagen.\u201d VW has set aside \u20ac16.2bn to cover the cost of the scandal and said on Thursday it expects about \u20ac8bn of this to be spent on buying back diesel cars. The group admitted in its annual report that its costs could rise still further, potentially forcing it to sell assets. It also released fresh financial data detailing the recent impact of the scandal on the VW brand, by far its largest by revenue. The marque swung from a \u20ac780m profit in the fourth quarter of last year to a \u20ac127m loss, compared with strong profits at its other brands, Audi, Porsche and Skoda. The group said it was withholding data on sales so far in 2016 on the advice of its lawyers. A report into the scandal by the law firm Jones Day was scheduled to be published this month, but has been delayed. VW said the investigation had so far gathered more than 100 terabytes of data. It has collected 1,500 external storage devices, such as USB sticks, from 380 employees, some of whom have been dismissed. The company said the data had helped \u201ctrace the origin and and the development of the diesel issue to a large extent\u201d. It believes the problem began with VW\u2019s efforts to grow in the US, where emissions restrictions on diesel cars are particularly strict. A \u201cgroup of persons \u2013 whose identity is still being determined\u201d had responded to this by modifying engine management software, VW said. Members of the board of management had no knowledge of this, the company insisted.",

    "webTitle": "Executive pay: Shareholder revolts at Weir and Shire- as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a packed day of frustrated shareholders and gloomy economic news. Before we go here\u2019s a summary of the main business stories: There have been widespread moves to oppose executive pay deals, including the majority of investors at Shire pharmaceuticals failing to support a 25% rise for its chief executive There was a big upset at the AGM of engineering group Weir with a 72% vote against a proposed remuneration policy At the Schroders AGM, shareholders registered their frustration with the elevation of former chief executive Michael Dobson to chairman. There was also a protest over pay at FTSE 100 building materials business CRH\u2019s AGM In a seemingly pre-emptive move ahead of WPP\u2019s own AGM in June, boss Sir Martin Sorrell has been out and about defending his bumper \u00a370m pay package In other company news, bailed out bank RBS has admitted further delays in offloading 300 Williams &amp; Glyn branches Business secretary Sajid Javid was quizzed by parliament\u2019s BIS committee about Britain\u2019s steel industry, where he said admitted that, with hindsight, he should have flown to Mumbai last month as Tata\u2019s board decided what to do with its UK steel plants. Tata Steel UK\u2019s CEO Bimlendra Jha, also before the BIS committee today, told MPs there would be \u201cvery bad consequences for the taxpayer\u201d if the pension liabilities of almost \u00a315bn facing the business are not dealt with. In economic news, the US suffered a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the opening quarter of this year In the UK, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has noted signs of a slowdown amid jitters around June\u2019s referendum on EU membership. Meanwhile an economists for Brexit report claimed output would be higher, the City would thrive, the trade deficit would be smaller and unemployment lower outside the EU In US company news, Shrek is coming under the same roof as Gru after after confirmation from Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal that it has lined up a $3.8bn deal to buy DreamWorks Animation After UK retailer BHS collapsed into administration on Monday Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell face being hauled in front of MPs to explain their management of the company The person who put forward Sir Philip Green for a knighthood has said he should be stripped of the honour if his handling of BHS is found to have lacked integrity Stock markets had a weak start on disappointment over the lack of fresh stimulus from the Bank of Japan And finally, as jitters return over Greece\u2019s bailout deal, reports from Brussels suggest Athens and its international lenders are almost in full agreement on a package of reforms. But a set of contingency steps requested by eurozone ministers last Friday still needs work, a top EU official tells Reuters. Phew! And now it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Following the upset at Weir\u2019s AGM, the engineering company\u2019s chairman, Charles Berry, has issued a statement (which, in a sign they are not letting earlier hopes go, contains quite a lot of \u201cwould haves\u201d). Here\u2019s an extract from the statement (with my bolding up of some key points): \u201cThe Board are pleased that shareholders have endorsed the vast majority of resolutions at today\u2019s Annual General Meeting. The Group\u2019s resolution on the Directors\u2019 Remuneration Policy did not gain sufficient support and will not now proceed. During an extensive consultation period, the Board had tried to forge a consensus between different shareholder views. \u201cThe Group\u2019s proposed policy would have offered senior management greater stability through the introduction of restricted stock awards in return for a substantial reduction in the maximum award available to the most senior Executive Director from 250% of salary to 165%. Restricted stock awards do not come with direct performance criteria but closely align senior management incentives with shareholder interests, as their value is dependent on share price performance, with the award taking five years to fully vest. In addition, the Remuneration Committee would have had the power to claw back restricted awards if necessary. \u201cThe policy was designed to ensure fairness and consistency across senior management levels and followed extensive consultation with shareholders, who held a wide range of views. During those discussions there was broad acknowledgement of the issue facing many companies, including Weir, of how to effectively recruit, retain and incentivise senior management, across multiple territories, when market conditions beyond their control remain challenging for a sustained period. \u201cIn Weir\u2019s case, these market conditions have recently included a significant fall in commodity prices as a result of oversupply in mining and oil markets and a slowdown in global economic growth. Given the volatility in end markets, the Group\u2019s Remuneration Committee has highlighted the difficulty in setting meaningful financial performance targets over the three-year period required by the current Long Term Incentive Plan.\u201d \u201cWhile acknowledging the issue faced by the Group, a majority of shareholders were clearly uncomfortable with a new approach which did not follow standard UK practice. However, as the Interim Report by the Investment Association\u2019s Executive Remuneration Working Group recently suggested, standard practice in the UK may not be sufficiently flexible and companies should be allowed \u2018to propose the remuneration structure that is in their judgement most appropriate\u2019 including consideration of the introduction of restricted stock.\u201d Some late, breaking AGM news now and the shareholder spring is in full flow with a big upset for engineering group Weir. There was a 72.4% vote against Weir\u2019s remuneration policy. The Glasgow engineer had two votes on pay, and the policy vote was also going to be subject to close scrutiny given it included a share award which was not linked to performance. Weir had argued it had used this policy for US directors and said the pay for the chief executive was down last year. Ahead of the vote, Hermes, representing pension funds, had said: \u201cWe are recommending to clients that they vote against, due to the proposed award of restricted shares which are not tied to performance targets.\u201d So it\u2019s back to the drawing board for Weir. On financial markets, London shares have managed to claw back some ground this afternoon and the FTSE 100 erased early losses to finish virtually unchanged on the day. The London bluechips index is 2.5 points higher at 6,322.40. It had earlier dropped sharply as markets around the world were dragged lower on disappointment at the Japanese central bank\u2019s decision not to come up with any fresh stimulus measures. It\u2019s a similar story of little change on the day across European stock markets with France\u2019s CAC40 index down just 0.3% and Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.1%. Spain\u2019s Ibex has fared worse, down 0.8%. Another FTSE 100 company -building materials business CRH - has also had a protest over pay, this time a binding vote over policy. Jill Treanor reports that just over 40% of shareholders voted against the new pay policy - which covers the next three years - and which increases the chief executive\u2019s pay potential by 50%. CRH, as an Irish incorporate company but listed in London, did not technically have to put its pay policy to a vote. Its remuneration report, which covers pay for 2015, had an 8% vote against. Back to AGM showdowns now and my colleague Julia Kollewe has been at the Schroders AGM today, where shareholders registered their frustration with the elevation of former chief executive Michael Dobson, who ran the investment firm for more than 14 years, to chairman. Julia reports: Nearly 15% voted against Dobson\u2019s re-election, and almost 12% voted against Lord Howard of Penrith, the senior independent director who oversaw the move. Hermes, which represents pension funds and had urged other investors to oppose Dobson\u2019s promotion, voted against both. It is a sizeable protest vote, given that the Schroders family owns 48% of the shares. Some 4% of investors voted against the firm\u2019s remuneration report. At the meeting in London, Lord Howard said the company was aware that it was breaching corporate governance guidelines by making Dobson chairman, but defended his promotion. \u201cWe thought he was such a good and such an obvious candidate,\u201d he said. One of the biggest fund managers in the City, Schroders had consulted its 10 largest investors, and \u201coverall we received considerable, a lot of support\u201d although he admitted that there were \u201csome shareholders who had concerns\u201d. Howard said the company would continue to talk to them. Royal London Asset Management voted against Schroders\u2019 pay policy and the appointment of Dobson as chair. Its corporate governance manager Ashley Hamilton Claxton said: \u201cAlthough Mr Dobson was successful in leading the company as CEO, his appointment as chairman is inappropriate and in clear violation of the corporate governance code.\u201d There have been fresh developments in the BHS story this afternoon. Following the retailer\u2019s collapse into administration on Monday, Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell face being hauled in front of MPs to explain their management of the company after an influential parliamentary committee launched an inquiry into the department store chain. Graham Ruddick reports: The Commons Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) select committee has announced it will explore the sale and acquisition of BHS, including whether the directors of Green\u2019s Arcadia and Retail Acquisitions acted as best they could to fulfil their statutory duties. BHS called in administrators on Monday, putting almost 11,000 jobs at risk. The retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 last March to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Chappell. BHS\u2019s collapse has caused controversy because it has been saddled with a \u00a3571m pension deficit despite Green collecting more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership, with Retail Acquisitions receiving payments of more than \u00a325m from BHS over the last 13 months. The full story: In US company news, Disney will have to size up to a formidable rival after confirmation from Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal that it has lined up a $3.8bn deal to buy DreamWorks Animation, maker of hits from Shrek to Kung Fu Panda. The deal will see DreamWorks Animation come under the same roof as NBCUniversal-owned Illumination Entertainment, maker of the hugely profitable Despicable Me films and spin-off Minions. The deal, a healthy premium on DreamWorks Animation\u2019s $2.3bn stock market valuation, is expected to close by the end of the year subject to clearance by competition regulators, reports Mark Sweney. Mark\u2019s full story: Back with the main economic story of the afternoon, the sharp slowdown in US GDP growth in the first quarter, as reported earlier, forms part of a worrying global trend, in the eyes of our economics editor Larry Elliott. Central bankers around the world are getting diminishing returns on their actions and all the major economies are expanding more weakly than they were in the middle of last year. The global economy is running out of steam and the conventional weapons are increasingly ineffective. This is not about blizzards shutting factories in Michigan. It goes much deeper than that,\u201d writes Larry. Here\u2019s the full comment: Sticking with UK news for a moment, Jill Treanor and Julia Kollewe have been following shareholder rebellions over pay today. They have more details on the majority of investors at Shire pharmaceuticals failing to support a 25% pay rise for its chief executive, Flemming \u00d8rnskov. The report continues: The increase in his salary to $1.7m (\u00a31.2m) means \u00d8rnskov\u2019s bonuses are also going up, a move which shareholders had been urged to protest against before the annual meeting on Thursday. The advisory pay vote squeezed through, as holders of 50.5% of the shares in the Dublin-based but London-listed FTSE 100 company voted in favour \u2013 but if deliberate abstentions were included, support for the board fell just below 50%. It builds on the defiant mood in which the AGM season started earlier this month when there were \u201cno votes\u201d at two FTSE 100 companies \u2013 BP and Smith &amp; Nephew \u2013 on the same day. Mining company Anglo American has also faced protests over pay, with more than 40% of investors voting against its remuneration report last week. Jill and Julia\u2019s full story is here: Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been in Stockport this week and talking about the EU referendum again. Growth appears to be slowing ahead of June\u2019s vote, said Carney, who has previously warned that Britain\u2019s economy could struggle to grow after a decision to quit the European Union. The referendum itself posed a significant risk to the economy, the Canadian said. He told the Stockport Express newspaper: \u201cIn the very short term the economy appears to be slowing, probably related to issues around the referendum. One of the responsibilities of the Bank of England is to manage risk and financial stability. \u201cRisks around the referendum are the biggest risks facing the UK economy, we have contingency planning to decrease the potential impacts of uncertainty.\u201d As we reported yesterday, the latest official figures showed UK economic growth slowed markedly in the first quarter of this year to 0.4% from 0.6% in the final three months of 2015. But economists are divided over how much of the slowdown could be blamed on the referendum. The full interview with Carney, including him fessing up to drinking a whole half pint of beer while on duty (gasp!) is here. In other UK news... the business select committee has launched a full inquiry into the collapse of high street chain BHS. They will investigate the sale of the business by Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 last year, what due diligence was done by the buyers, and whether the taxpayer is now on the hook for BHS\u2019s pension bill. Iain Wright MP, committee chair, says: \u201cThe collapse of BHS brings misery and uncertainty for thousands of workers and also places a potentially significant burden on the taxpayer in the form of pension liabilities. The sale and acquisition of BHS raises real questions about whether directors acted in the best long-term interests of the company and their employees. Is there too much of an incentive in the system for owners to asset-strip, take out vast sums for personal gain, and then dump and run leaving the taxpayer to pick up the tab when the company fails, rather than create value for the long-term? Back in the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland has admitted that it will probably fail to sell its Williams &amp; Glyn division by the end of next year. It has just warned that City that it will probably miss a deadline of the end of 2017 to offload more than 300 branches, due to the complexity of separating customers from the rest of RBS. The overall financial impact on RBS is now likely to be significantly greater than previously estimated, it admits. RBS shares have been hit hard, down 4.6%. This is the third year running in which US growth has been alarmingly weak in the January-March quarter. There\u2019s no chance of the US central bank raising interest rates while growth is so weak, argues Tom Floyd of Foenix Partners. According to Floyd, Americans can stop worrying that interest rates might rise in June. Despite the Fed\u2019s best efforts to leave the door open for a hike at the next meeting, today\u2019s GDP data risks blowing it firmly shut. The data, showing a rise of just 0.5% in the first quarter versus expectations of a rise of 0.7%, undermines the more hawkish Fed tone from last night and does little to justify an imminent raise. Although the Fed dropped language acknowledging global risks it is worth noting the next meeting is only 8 days before the next major global risk event, the Brexit vote. In light of the soft data and the looming referendum, a June hike is looking increasingly unlikely with Janet Yellen\u2019s attempts to convince markets to the contrary becoming largely futile. Traders will remain rightly sceptical. Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, is also concerned by the slowdown in US growth: \u201cThe US economy hasn\u2019t run aground by any means, but it is navigating more difficult domestic waters than three months ago. Growth has been weighed down by weak performances in the manufacturing and energy sectors due to the strong dollar and volatile oil prices. On top of this, consumer confidence has been knocked recently, impacting retail sales. \u201cAlthough today\u2019s results clearly indicate a slowdown in growth, it\u2019s important to remember that the US economy has still expanded. The labour market is in reasonably good shape, and global risks seem to be slightly more muted than at the start of the year. This will help support domestic momentum as the year progresses. Paul Sommerville of Sommerville Advisory Markets says an annualised growth rate of 0.5% is \u2018woeful\u2019. This is America\u2019s weakest quarterly growth rate in almost two years: And while consumer spending is up, exports and business spending have fallen - suggesting the US recovery is uneven, as well as weak. Breaking news from America: The US economy has barely grown at all in the last three months. US GDP expanded by 0.5%, on an annualised basis, according to the US commerce department. That\u2019s a quarterly growth rate of just 0.125% - a very measly outcome - and weaker than the 0.4% which Britain reported yesterday. Although consumer spending rose by 1.9%, business investment tumbled by 5.9%, suggesting corporations cut back sharply. Here\u2019s Graham Ruddick\u2019s early story about this morning\u2019s session, in which Tata Steel\u2019s UK boss warned of \u2018disaster\u2019 looming unless a deal is reached. Sajid Javid has been spoken of as a future prime minister. Even Forbes Magazine got in on the act, saying it would be a cheering rags-to-riches story if Javid got the keys to Number 10. But his hopes of a glittering career are now tightly bound with the future of Britain\u2019s steel industry. Today\u2019s session showed us that: 1) Javid regrets that fateful trip to Australia. He freely admitted that, with hindsight, he should have flown to Mumbai last month as Tata\u2019s board decided what to do with its UK steel plants. He also insists it wouldn\u2019t have done any good, as his department has been working behind the scenes since February. But we\u2019ll never know if Tata might have softened the tone of its announcement, if Javid had been banging on the boardroom door promising to do whatever it took to keep the mills running. Javid failed to shake off the impression that the government was caught out by Tata\u2019s decision - suggesting it didn\u2019t actually have a full grip on the crisis. And if Port Talbot closes, Javid may go down in political history as the man who took his teenage daughter on a jolly to Australia as the steel industry burned. Harsh game, politics. 2) It\u2019s all about the pensions. Javid agreed with Tata\u2019s Steel UK SEO Bimlendra Jha that the pension liabilities are crucial. Several potential buyers have already said they wouldn\u2019t take them on, so Tata and the government need to find a way of resolving the \u00a315bn scheme, and its deficit. Javid claims that Tata\u2019s pension scheme is not a \u2018major risk\u2019 to taxpayers. But that\u2019s not the same as saying taxpayers won\u2019t pay a penny.... And don\u2019t forget that Jha warned of economic and social disaster if the pension problem isn\u2019t dealt with... 3) The government won\u2019t own more than 25% of British steel. Javid is committed to taking a 25% stake in Tata UK, if it helps find a buyer. But that\u2019s his limit - anything more would, in his view, be counterproductive. That\u2019s a typically Thatcherite view, and means full nationalisation isn\u2019t on the cards. Q: Finally, what can you do to reassure customers and suppliers to keep working with Tata steel at this time? Sajid Javid says he has already written to all Tata\u2019s customers and suppliers, and contacted the largest ones directly. He has also asked Tata to give similar reassurances. But the biggest comfort I can give is the action that we are prepared to take, and how far we will go to get a deal. That means customers and suppliers can look at this and say \u2018this business has a long-term future\u2019. It\u2019s an ongoing process too - we need to keep reassuring people. Javid concludes the session by insisting that the government is doing everything it can, along with other partners such as the Welsh government and unions. The Community union couldn\u2019t be more helpful if it tried, he concludes. That\u2019s the end of the session. Q: If a potential buyer says it needs nine months to agree a deal, but Tata insist on a quick deal, would you step in with a bridging loan? I\u2019m not going to rule anything out, Javid replies, but the focus is to find a commercial operator quickly. A nine-month process isn\u2019t in anyone\u2019s interest. Q: You have offered to take a 25% stake in Tata UK. Is that your maximum limit? Javid says his offer of 25% co-ownership was designed to show potential buyers that he\u2019s serious about getting a deal. But the 25% figure is important - if you go over that, the government would be a significant shareholder, and too closely involved. Q: How long would you be prepared to hold this stake before looking to exit? Javid says it\u2019s too early to say. Q: Unions have told us they would favour scrapping the lesser duty rule, in favour of a new solution just for the steel sector. Is this under consideration? Javid says he still supports the lesser duty rule [this is the rule that prevents higher tariffs being imposed on Chinese steel] The lesser duty rule works, Javid insists. Its intention is to stop dumping or provide compensation. If we scrapped it, we would have spent an extra \u00a3500m on the solar industry for example [because the lesser duty rule covers a range of industries, not just steel] Q: Do you believe Tata are a responsible seller, given they didn\u2019t fully brief you about their plans for a quick sale? Yes, Javid replies, based on the conversations I\u2019d had with them. They have approached this issue responsibly. Q: Is there timeline appropriate? They are talking about finding a buyer within weeks, but this will take months. Tata are losing money every day, so they can\u2019t have unlimited time. But it is important that they do everything possible to find a responsible buyer. I have every reason to believe that when they promise to be responsible, that will be reflected in the timeline, Javid hints. MPs are questioning whether Sajid Javid is really doing enough to help the steel industry. I will do everything in my power to help, but I cannot influence the price of steel, says Javid Q: But what about tariffs? Should the EU move faster to identify problems? Speed of action is an issue, Javid replies -- that\u2019s why I called a meeting last year to look at the issue of dumping. Europe must move faster. Reminder: Javid actually blocked a measure to impose higher tariffs on Chinese steel imports.... But the business secretary is adamant that tariffs can work. Take wire rod imports - they have gone from 67,000 tonnes to zero. Q: What is your working assumption about the pension liabilities, if there is a successful sale? Javid says commercial sensitivities prevent him saying too much. But several potential buyers have said they wouldn\u2019t be interested if they had to take on Tata\u2019s pension liabilities. It\u2019s a big scheme, with 130,000 members, and it\u2019s relatively expensive. Q: So might the public purse be left \u2018holding the baby\u2019? No, Javid replies. Discussions are already underway to finding a solution. Q: You really don\u2019t think it\u2019s a risk? It\u2019s not a major risk to the public purse, no, Javid insists. Q: What top three lessons can we learn from the Scottish government\u2019s deal to save two Tata steel plants? Javid says it\u2019s hard to learn lessons - given the Scottish plans were steel mills (recycling steel) rather than a blast furnace (which makes new metal). And it only involved 300 jobs. Q: But surely we can learn lessons from Scotland\u2019s speed of response? (they brokered a deal which say Tata sell the site to Liberty House). Javid doesn\u2019t accept that Westminster have been acting too slowly. But we must help workers to keep their skills \u2018fresh\u2019, or reskill if needed. The committee aren\u2019t impressed with Javid\u2019s claims that Britain is getting better at using home-smelted steel for big government contracts. They point out that the Minister for Defence Procurement has admitted he doesn\u2019t have the full records of where it sourced its steel from (details). Javid reiterates that the situation is improving. But we can\u2019t always assume that a UK steelmaker will make the most competitive bid for a project.... Q: Why hasn\u2019t the government moved faster to change procurement rules to use more UK steel in infrastructure projects? Javid says the government needed to ensure the changes were legally watertight. Changes are being made, and they will make a difference. But he accepts that they have not made an impact yet. Javid has been accused of misleading the committee over SSI Redcar, by Labour MP Tom Blenkinsop, who represents Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland. The committee asks why Javid allowed the steel works at Redcar to close last autumn. Q: Why did you rejecting an offer from one company to keep the coke ovens open, and \u201cshut the door rapidly\u201d on negotiations? Javid insists that the Redcar plant didn\u2019t have a viable future, and no serious offers. So given the uncertainty facing workers, he wanted to quickly arrange a package to help them retrain and find new jobs. Committee chairman Iain Wright isn\u2019t impressed, telling the secretary of state that he should have allowed Redcar to be mothballed. Instead, Javid allowed the \u201cabsolute tragedy\u201d of a hard closure. We\u2019ve lost those skills from the steel industry for ever..... And an absolute disgrace that it was allowed to happened on your watch. Q: Anna Soubry says she heard about Tata\u2019s plans via Twitter. You were on the other side of the world - how can you claim you were in control? Javid reiterates that commercial sensitivity stopped the government from saying more. Q: The government has given some very mixed messages - first saying that nationalisation was off the table, but now offering to do whatever it takes. Do you accept you have been on the back foot throughout this crisis? Javid denies this, claiming the government\u2019s message has been consistent despite the pressure not to release commercially sensitive decisions. He points out that minister Anna Soubry didn\u2019t rule out nationalisation, but then adds: Rarely is nationalisation a solution - the best companies are in private hands. Q: You\u2019re doing it again - \u2018rarely\u2019 is not a decisive word. It doesn\u2019t suggest a clear-cut plan to what\u2019s been unfolding. Javid repeats that he is under control. It has taken time for Tata to release info about its own plans, and the government has been reacting and adding its own detail. Javid\u2019s decision to fly to Australia last month, not Mumbai, is particularly sensitive as he also took his teenage daughter along. Q: Businesses complain about the lack of a level playing field, so what can be done to help firms compete with German firms? Javid says that more needs to be done on energy costs -- an issue which Tata UK raised earlier in this session. Some early reaction to Javid\u2019s testimony: Q: If you could turn the clock back a month, would you have attended that meeting in Mumbai rather than going to Australia? Of course, says Sajid Jabid. With the benefit of hindsight, knowing what Tata would say and how it would be reported. But the reality is that he must travel as part of his role as business secretary. Key point: Javid admits he should have attended crunch board meeting in Mumbai. Q: Isn\u2019t the truth that you were blindsided by Tata, which is why you set off to Australia leaving no-one in London who could deal with this crisis? No, Javid insists. Tata is a large global business, so people in every management layer don\u2019t always have all the information about what\u2019s happening. He denies that a better early warning system would have helped. Q: It looked like you were on the back foot after the Mumbai meeting, in panic mode and scrambling around to get the initiative. Javid denied that he should have flown to Mumbai for the board meeting - that would have been far too late. It might have made a great photo opportunity, but it wouldn\u2019t have helped. Instead, our work in the weeks before the meeting were crucial. And the government couldn\u2019t have shared some information because it was legally sensitive - announcing it could have made the situation worse. Q: So when the Tata board met in Mumbai in late March, were you convinced that they had dropped the idea of complete closure and were looking for a buyer? Yes, says Javid. Q: So did Tata mislead you? No, says Javid. But he was surprised by the speed at which Tata was looking to sell up. Q: Frankly, secretary of state, I don\u2019t understand why you weren\u2019t in Mumbai, says Iain Wright. Javid repeats that he had been shocked to learn in February that Port Talbot could close, but he had then begun looking for a buyer. So he was startled by newspaper reports that the board decided to settle the issue \u2018within weeks\u2019 That is not what we agreed with Tata, and that\u2019s not what they are not planning to do. Javid says he went on his (infamous) trade mission to Australia knowing that he could return if needed - as he did. Sajid Javid has arrived, flanked by two senior officials. Iain Wright, BIS committee chair, goes first: Q: You told the House on 11 April that Tata were seriously considering closing Port Talbot. The CEO of Tata UK has questioned that this morning [earlier] - so who actually told you, and when? Javid says that Tata India (so not the UK branch) told him in mid-February that they were considering shutting Port Talbot and focusing on the rest of their UK operations. We then worked intensively to try to persuade Tata to keep funding their operations, and embark on a turnaround plan. But it became clear that the board might not accept that, so we began considering whether an alternative owner could be found instead - and considering what we could do to assist Q: What did you do between mid-February and the Mumbai board meeting at the end of March when the decision to sell up was taken? Javid says he asked the company if there was anything we could do that would prevent them from closing Port Talbot. And the short answer was no. There were things they wanted us to do for the rest of the business - but I kept my focus on saving Port Talbot. So we began considering whether another buyer could be found. Tata is a global producer, not just a UK one, so there may be another company who could take their operations on. Reminder, you can watch today\u2019s hearing here. We should hear from the business secretary in a moment.... That\u2019s the end of the session with Bimlendra Jha, so what did MPs learn from the Tata UK boss? 1) The pension issue is absolutely crucial. No potential buyer is going to buy Port Talbot, and Tata\u2019s other steel plants, without some solution Tata\u2019s pension fund has \u00a315bn of liabilities, and an estimated deficit of under \u00a3500m. The collapse of high street chain BHS showed that pension black holes get bigger when a firm goes under, as potential losses are \u201ccrystallised\u201d. Jha insisted that there are ways of fixing this problem, without using public money; hopefully Sajid Javid can give more details shortly. 2) Tata insists it kept the government in the loop. The \u201cwriting was on the wall all the time\u201d, Jha insists, when quizzed about exactly when it warned the government that the situation was unsustainable. That raises fresh questions about Javid\u2019s decision to fly to Australia as the crisis escalated. 3) Can Port Talbot be saved, in current climate? Jha says there are \u201cserious question marks\u201d over the South Wales plant. And he pinned the blame firmly on high costs, such as energy and business rates, that are making it unprofitable. We would not be selling up if we could make money, he insists. 4) This crisis could still end very badly. As he urged the government to address the pension issue, Jha warned that the stakes are terribly high. It\u2019s not just the four thousand or so workers at Port Talbot, but the \u201ceconomic and social consequences of that kind of disaster\u201d if steel fails. Q: What can be done to remove uncertainty and help solve this crisis? This uncertainty is exactly why we need an accelerated timescale for this sale, says Bimlendra Jha. He may still be bristling from that criticism that Tata want \u2018non-binding\u2019 letters of intent from potential buyers next week). We must remove uncertainty among customers, suppliers and staff. The government have given us letters, which we can use to reassure suppliers, he adds. Q: What happens to Tata UK\u2019s pension liabilities if Port Talbot closes or is sold? The number of contributors goes down by 4,700, Jha replies, so the burden increases and the scheme becomes weaker. Bimlendra Jha then gives MPs a lesson in running a manufacturing giant in the 21st century. UK manufacturing is in decline, and when we hurt ourselves with high energy costs or business rates you hurt the whole industry. And when a firm can easily move over the Channel and buy energy cheaper, the situation quickly worsens. We cannot be the ones who shut the door on the industrial revolution which began in this country, Jha declares, jabbing at his desk. And this chart, from retail commentator Paul Mitchell, shows how rates have gone up and up: Q: We\u2019ve heard a lot about pensions liabilities at BHS this week, but those liabilities would be dwarfed by Tata Steel\u2019s liabilities. What consideration have you taken about potential liabilities to the UK taxpayer? We need to be aware that if this pension fund liability is not taken care of, there is no buyer sitting out there to buy this business, CEO Jha replies. [Tata UK has a pension scheme of around \u00a315bn, and a deficit of around \u00a3485m] If we don\u2019t solve this problem, we are staring at some very bad consequences for the UK taxpayers, Jha continues. It\u2019s not just the Tata Steel workers, it\u2019s the entire supply chain and the entire communities that demand on it. Jha says: I don\u2019t know what arithmetic has been done on the economic and social consequences of that kind of disaster.... Key point: Tata says no buyer for its steel works unless pension fund liability is addressed Q: What about your arithmetic? You bought this business, and you knew about the liabilities at the time... We have kept it funded, Jha interjects Q: But is there a wider issue about businesses walking away from their liabilities? Tata have constantly put money into the pension fund. We have had constant dialogue with our trade union partners. Jha then says Tata has been speaking to the government about finding solutions that would not involve public money or hurt the company. He suggests that a move to a defined contribution scheme, rather than a final salary scheme, would help. Q: Do all communications between Tata and the UK government go through you, Mr Jha? No, replies Jha (who took over as CEO earlier this month) So you can\u2019t be sure that Tata didn\u2019t privately tell the government months ago that it was considering closure (as Sajid Javid told MPs this month). Jha confirms that this is true, but then warns: There are serious question marks about the viability of Port Talbot. Q: Does Tata believe the UK government is open to buying British steel for infrastructure projects? Marc Meyohas of Greybull Capital says the government is open to dialogue on this issue, and it\u2019s crucial that this dialogue delivers results. The government have made it clear they are behind the industry, he says. Q: Anything in writing? Not to us, Meyohas replies. Q: How long have you been talking intensively with the UK government? We have been talking to the government on a daily basis for months, Bimlendra Jha says. There is now also a team from Tata\u2019s in Q: When did you tell the government that the situation was so serious? Jha can\u2019t say exactly when it happened, during the ongoing dialogue over issues such as business rates. Q: When did you decide to pull out of the UK? At the board meeting of 29 March, when the board released that the losses were unsustainable. Q: But the government would have known how serious things were? The writing was on the wall all the time, Jha says. It\u2019s hard to say when the penny drops in someone\u2019s mind, though. Key point: Tata says government was aware of how serious the problems were. The commitee turn to Marc Meyohas of Greybull Capital, which is funding a management buyout of Tata\u2019s site in Scunthorpe. We are confident that the management plan to turn Scunthorpe around will work, says Meyohas. Q: Will it work better than your involvement with Comet (the UK retailer which collapsed in 2012)? We only had a small involvement in Comet, Meyohas insists. There is great sadness that we are leaving the UK, Jha concludes, but we must be responsible to our shareholders too. Q: Is the government doing enough? Tata UK CEO Bimlendra Jha says there is a growing awareness that more needs to be done, such as on energy costs. But there are serious structural weaknesses - Tata UK would not be loss-making if we had Germany\u2019s energy costs. Q: Would you be selling the business if there wasn\u2019t an uneven playing field? We wouldn\u2019t not be selling the business if it wasn\u2019t loss-making, Jha insists. Tata has put in \u00a31.5bn in capital expenditure, and written off \u00a32bn, and hasn\u2019t taken a divident from the UK operations in the last nine years. We have taken all the hit, all the time. Q: What is the timescale for a sale? There is no deaddrop time, but given the losses, urgency is important as we can\u2019t continue to bleed money. Q: Can you guarantee that you will keep the UK operations running until a buyer is found to save jobs? We cannot give any such commitment Q: So do you have an internal deadline? Jha insists that Tata is a responsible seller, however... What if no buyer emerges? We cannot continue to bleed. Iain Wright asks why Tata has asked potential buyers to submit offers by next week. Why is the timescale so short? Our world reknown advisors believe this is a liberal timescale compared to what administrators would do, says Bimlendra Jha. Iain Wright, committee chairman, begins by asking Bimlendra Jha when Tata first began considering closing its UK steel operations rather than selling it. We haven\u2019t said we are planning to close it, Jha replies. But the secretary of state told Parliament he was told privately several weeks ago that Tata was considering immediate closure, Wright says. Our board meeting only decided to exit the UK, Jha says. Wright asks if Tata intimated to the government that you might simply close the sites? No. Jha insists. There is a very difficult business case to continue with Port Talbot. Therefore, we must find a buyer who can make the whole UK strip system work - both Port Talbot, and the downstream operations. The hearing on the Steel Industry is starting now, the Grimond Room of the House of Commons. The first witnesses are Bimlendra Jha, CEO of Tata Steel UK, and Marc Meyohas, partner of Greybull Capital. You can watch it live here. A month ago, the crisis in Britain\u2019s steel industry appeared to be career-defining for Sajid Javid. Not in a good way, either. Famously, the business secretary jetted off to a trip to Australia just as Tata\u2019s board took the momentous decision to sell all its UK operations. He was then dragged back to Britain (with a non-too-impressed teenage daughter in tow), and only reached Port Talbot on April 1 three days after the story broke. Over the last month, Javid should have had his head down helping to find a buyer for Tata\u2019s UK steelworkers and save around 40,000 jobs. Last week, he announced that the government would provide hundreds of millions of pounds in state support, such as loans and grants, and possibly even an equity stake. Today\u2019s steel hearing comes two days after prime minister David Cameron visited Tata\u2019s main blast furnace on the south coast of Wales: The Press Association explains: Prime Minister David Cameron visited the Tata Steel works in Port Talbot, South Wales, on Tuesday to assure workers, unions and bosses of the Government\u2019s commitment to support the future of steel-making at the under-threat plant. Unions welcomed the recent offer of state support for potential buyers, but stressed that any action must cover plants across the whole country and not just in Wales. Mr Rickhuss said the Prime Minister had \u201clooked proud steelworkers in the eye and promised to do all he could to protect their jobs\u201d, and said his union would \u201chold him at his word\u201d. European stock markets have been dragged down by disappointment that the Bank of Japan didn\u2019t unleash more stimulus today. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 40 points or 0.6%, and there are similar losses in Paris and Frankfurt. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says: London equities have been rattled in early trade with the shock news that the Bank of Japan offered no further stimulus being seen as a key factor in driving sentiment. Britain\u2019s investors have a great chance to protest against excessive boardroom pay today. No fewer than 26 companies are holding annual general meetings today, and there could be revolts against remuneration policies at several major companies including drugs firm Shire Pharmaceuticals, and engineering group Weir. My colleague Jill Treanor explains: The votes on pay at Shire Pharmaceuticals, CRH (a building materials business) and Weir are expected to be tight, especially at Shire \u2013 where chief executive Flemming \u00d8rnskov is receiving a 25% rise in his salary to $1.7m (\u00a31.2m). Investors in Japan are nursing heavy losses today after the country\u2019s central bank defied expectations of yet more stimulus measures. The main Japanese stock index, the Nikkei, has slumped by 3.6% and the yen has soared against the US dollar. All because the Bank of Japan left its (already sizeable) stimulus programme unchanged at today\u2019s policy meeting. Economists had been expecting another big move - further rate cuts and yet more electronic money-printing, to try and get Japan\u2019s growth and inflation rate up. So, bad news for plucky investors. But perhaps a victory for those who argue monetary policy shouldn\u2019t be the only tool fighting the economic malaise. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The future of Britain\u2019s steel industry is under scrutiny today, as MPs investigate efforts to save tens of thousands of jobs at Tata\u2019s operations across the UK. Business secretary Sajid Javid will be quizzed about the government\u2019s plans this morning, at 10.30am. Before that, the BIS select committee will also hear from Bimlendra Jha, chief executive of Tata and Marc Meyohas of Greybull Capital, which is buying Tata\u2019s plant at Scunthorpe. MPs are presumably going to ask how the UK steel industry reached this plight, the issue of Chinese steel dumping, and the government\u2019s offer to partly nationalise the sites. They should also probe reports that Tata might actually keep the sites, a month after shocking Britain by putting them up for sale. Here\u2019s the key timings: At 9.10am Bimlendra Jha, CEO, Tata Steel UK Marc Meyohas, Partner, Greybull Capital LLP At 9.50am Fergus Ewing MSP, Minister for Business, Energy and Tourism Edwina Hart AM, Minister for Economy, Science and Transport Tom Blenkinsop MP, Chair, All Party Parliamentary Group for the Steel and Metal Related Industry Gareth Stace, Director, UK Steel Roy Rickhuss, General Secretary of Community and Chair of the National Trade Union Steel Coordinating Committee At 10.30am The Rt Hon Sajid Javid MP, Secretary of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills Niall McKenzie, Director, Infrastructure &amp; Materials, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills Anthony Odgers, Deputy Chief Executive and Director, Corporate Finance UK Government Investments Also coming up today.... At 1.30pm, we find out how the US economy fared in the last quarter. Economists expect a sharp slowdown, to a quarterly rate of just 0.15%. That would make Britain\u2019s slowdown, to 0.4%, look quite decent - and would also fuel concerns that the global economy is weakening. In the City, Lloyds bank is reporting financial results. And the Greek bailout crisis is also rumbling on. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is due to speak to European Council President Donald Tusk today, after Tusk rejected his call on Wednesday for a leaders\u2019 summit to discuss Greece\u2019s bailout talks. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Restricted stock awards do not come with direct performance criteria but closely align senior management incentives with shareholder interests, as their value is dependent on share price performance, with the award taking five years to fully vest. In addition, the Remuneration Committee would have had the power to claw back restricted awards if necessary. </p> <p>\u201cThe policy was designed to ensure fairness and consistency across senior management levels and followed extensive consultation with shareholders, who held a wide range of views. During those discussions there was broad acknowledgement of the issue facing many companies, including Weir, of how to effectively recruit, retain and incentivise senior management, across multiple territories, when market conditions beyond their control remain challenging for a sustained period.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn Weir\u2019s case, these <strong>market conditions have recently included a significant fall in commodity prices as a result of oversupply in mining and oil markets and a slowdown in global economic growth.</strong> Given the volatility in end markets, the Group\u2019s Remuneration Committee has highlighted the difficulty in setting meaningful financial performance targets over the three-year period required by the current Long Term Incentive Plan.\u201d <br></p> <p> \u201cWhile acknowledging the issue faced by the Group, <strong>a majority of shareholders were clearly uncomfortable with a new approach which did not follow standard UK practice</strong>. However, as the Interim Report by the Investment Association\u2019s Executive Remuneration Working Group recently suggested, standard practice in the UK may not be sufficiently flexible and companies should be allowed \u2018to propose the remuneration structure that is in their judgement most appropriate\u2019 including consideration of the introduction of restricted stock.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-28T16:22:24.903Z\">at 5.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57223028e4b02046f02ebe64\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-28T15:53:11.208Z\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Weir Group voted down on pay policy</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some late, breaking AGM news now and the shareholder spring is in full flow with a big upset for engineering group Weir.</p> <p><strong>There was a 72.4% vote against Weir\u2019s remuneration policy.</strong><br></p> <p>The Glasgow engineer had two votes on pay, and the policy vote was also going to be subject to close scrutiny given it included a share award which was not linked to performance. <br></p> <p>Weir had argued it had used this policy for US directors and said the pay for the chief executive was down last year. <br></p> <p>Ahead of the vote, Hermes, representing pension funds, had said: \u201cWe are recommending to clients that they vote against, due to the proposed award of restricted shares which are not tied to performance targets.\u201d</p> <p>So it\u2019s back to the drawing board for Weir.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/status/725712779408203776\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">And so the shareholder protests continue: Engineering company Weir gets a 72.4% vote against the remuneration policy</p>&mdash; Jill Treanor (@jilltreanor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/status/725712779408203776\">April 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/status/725713247068938240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Weir says it will continue to operate under the remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders in 2014</p>&mdash; Jill Treanor (@jilltreanor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/status/725713247068938240\">April 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-28T15:54:30.999Z\">at 4.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57222e2ce4b0a2f1205147bc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-28T15:45:13.905Z\">4.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE erases losses to finish marginally up on the day</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On financial markets, London shares have managed to claw back some ground this afternoon and the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> erased early losses to finish virtually unchanged on the day.</p> <p>The London bluechips index is <strong>2.5 points higher at 6,322.40</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is facing further problems in offloading 300 Williams &amp; Glyn branches, in a fresh blow to the management team of the bailed-out bank. The European Union demanded the branches be separated as the price of agreeing to RBS\u2019s \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout. Lloyds Banking Group was also required under state aid rules to carve out TSB in return for its government rescue. But on Thursday, the Edinburgh-based RBS said the cost of the spin-out, previously put at \u00a31.2bn, was escalating and it may miss the deadline to complete the disposal \u2013 which had already been extended to December 2017. This may make it even more difficult for the chancellor, George Osborne, to further reduce the government\u2019s 73% stake in the bank. Spinning out the Williams &amp; Glyn branches has already created difficulty for RBS. A sale to Santander was abandoned in 2012 and a subsequent deal was announced in 2013 with a consortium backed by investments from the Church of England to try to complete the separation. Then late last year RBS said it might also consider an auction for the branches. Shares in the bank fell almost 5%, to 240p \u2013 well below the 502p at which taxpayers break even on their stake. \u201cDue to the complexities of Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s customer and product mix, the programme to create a cloned banking platform continues to be very challenging and the timetable to achieve separation is uncertain,\u201d RBS said. \u201cWe have concluded that there is a significant risk that the separation and divestment to which we are committed will not be achieved by 31 December 2017. RBS is exploring alternative means to achieve separation and divestment. The overall financial impact on RBS is now likely to be significantly greater than previously estimated.\u201d Ross McEwan, who became chief executive in October 2013, is expected to face questions on the problems when he presents the bank\u2019s first-quarter figures on Friday. The announcement was rushed out to the market after the board of the bank \u2013 which has not made an annual profit since 2007 \u2013 had met to discuss the first-quarter trading statement. Joseph Dickerson, an analyst at Jefferies, said: \u201cWe struggle to comprehend what management have learned about the separation business since their last update to the market on 26 February and also that the separation of this business has been under way since late 2009. The news is negative on two fronts: a potential delay in capital return and also likely higher separation costs. Moreover the delays could call into question management execution of RBS\u2019s restructuring process.\u201d Analysts are expected to want clarity on any impact on the possibility of payouts to shareholders \u2013 currently expected next year. Lloyds, which admitted on Thursday its first quarter profits had fallen by 46% to \u00a3654m, has separated out 600 TSB branches, created a new image on the high street and floated the bank on the stock market before it was sold to Sabadell of Spain last year. TSB relies on Lloyds for its IT, despite being a separate bank, while RBS is trying to create a standalone branch network.",

    "webTitle": "Philip Green \u2018should lose knighthood if integrity over BHS found wanting\u2019", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The person who put forward Sir Philip Green for a knighthood has said he should be stripped of the honour if his handling of BHS is found to have lacked integrity. Green sold BHS last year for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium led by Dominic Chappell. The department store chain had a pensions deficit of \u00a3571m after the Green family withdrew hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends. BHS went into administration this week putting 11,000 jobs at risk. Sir John Collins, a former chairman of Dixons who headed the Whitehall honours committee which proposed Green\u2019s ennoblement, said the BHS story was \u201cnot a good one\u201d and its sale to Retail Acquisitions did not fill him with confidence. Collins added: \u201cThe judgment that has to be made is whether in the sale of BHS, has the man acted with the integrity that would underpin being awarded a knighthood? If you decide that he hasn\u2019t then he should lose it.\u201d Green was knighted in 2006 following approval by the then prime minister, Tony Blair, \u201cfor services to the retail industry\u201d. Collins said: \u201cAt that moment he was hailed as a very successful retailer [and] he was also considered fair and generous in helping with charities.\u201d He said he was \u201cconscious that sentiment changes\u201d and now wanted those in charge of the honours system to consider whether the knighthood should be rescinded. \u201cOur golden rule was that you must have done exceptionally well in your profession, but you must have done something beyond that for society,\u201d Collins said. \u201cIf the judgment was that you have not continued your behaviour in a manner that was consistent with the award granted to you then it is fair that it is removed. \u201cI feel the BHS story is not a good one. I feel those who were overseeing these things, the sale and who it was sold to, it doesn\u2019t fill me with confidence.\u201d Paul Flynn MP, a Labour member of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, said he would refer Green to Whitehall\u2019s honours forfeiture committee. The forfeiture committee has previously removed knighthoods from Fred Goodwin, the disgraced chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, and James Crosby, a chief executive of Halifax bank. More usually, the committee removes honours from people such as sex offender Rolf Harris, who have been sentenced to prison for at least three months for a criminal offence, or those who have been censured or struck off by a professional or regulatory body. Last year Blair praised Green as a \u201creal visionary\u201d for setting up his Fashion Retail Academy in London in 2005. Recalling their first meeting, he said: \u201cPhilip never graduated from the school of diplomacy, but rather the school of life, and there was a real meeting of minds that day.\u201d The intervention by Collins, a senior figure within the honours system at the time, will ratchet up pressure on Green over his business tactics. It also emerged on Thursday that Green and Chappell could be called to give evidence before MPs on the business, innovation and skills select committee. The committee announced it will explore the sale and acquisition of BHS, including whether the directors of Green\u2019s Arcadia and Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions acted as best they could to fulfil their statutory duties. Paul Budge, the finance director of Green\u2019s company Arcadia, risked angering BHS staff and pensioners when he said the chain was \u201clike Woolwooths and Littlewoods \u2026 past its sell-by date\u201d. Budge defended Green\u2019s handling of BHS, claiming that the \u00a3400m of cash taken out of the company by the former owner, his family and other shareholders was offset by about the same amount in loans, property and cash. \u201cPhilip\u2019s optics are that the family got out \u00a3280m in dividends and the family has lost \u00a3255m in funding BHS over the years and then has sold it for \u00a31, giving the new owner \u00a374m in cash and \u00a3100m worth of property,\u201d said Budge. Green is already embroiled in an investigation by the BHS administrators, Duff &amp; Phelps, into what happened at the department store chain in recent years. This could potentially lead to the government\u2019s Insolvency Service striking off company directors or even mounting criminal prosecutions. Duff &amp; Phelps reassured staff on Thursday that workers\u2019 wages would continue as a \u201cpriority payment\u201d and said it had received \u201ca number of expressions of interest\u201d in the business. The Pensions Regulator is also investigating the BHS pension scheme to determine whether to take action to pursue those \u201cdeliberately attempting to avoid their pension obligations\u201d. Green has reportedly offered \u00a380m to help fill the pensions gap, but that will still leave a much larger deficit. Most of the cash and all of the property were part of the business that was being sold rather than the personal assets of the Green family. John Mann MP said Green should lose the title unless he pays back \u00a3400m in dividends extracted from BHS before its collapse. Vince Cable, business secretary from 2010 to 2015 who clashed with Green over his tax affairs, said: \u201cIf there are any questions about his conduct with the company then this isn\u2019t a matter about knighthoods \u2013 it\u2019s actually something that should be looked at by Companies House, whose specific role is to investigate the conduct of directors. That is where the debate should be.\u201d",

The committee announced it will explore the sale and acquisition of BHS, including whether the directors of Green\u2019s Arcadia and Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions acted as best they could to fulfil their statutory duties.</p> <p>Paul Budge, the finance director of Green\u2019s company Arcadia, risked angering BHS staff and pensioners when he said the chain was \u201clike Woolwooths and Littlewoods \u2026 past its sell-by date\u201d.</p> <p>Budge defended Green\u2019s handling of BHS, claiming that the \u00a3400m of cash taken out of the company by the former owner, his family and other shareholders was offset by about the same amount in loans, property and cash.</p> <p>\u201cPhilip\u2019s optics are that the family got out \u00a3280m in dividends and the family has lost \u00a3255m in funding BHS over the years and then has sold it for \u00a31, giving the new owner \u00a374m in cash and \u00a3100m worth of property,\u201d said Budge.</p> <p>Green is already embroiled in an investigation by the BHS administrators, Duff &amp; Phelps, into what happened at the department store chain in recent years. This could potentially lead to the government\u2019s Insolvency Service striking off company directors or even mounting criminal prosecutions.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Duff &amp; Phelps reassured staff on Thursday that workers\u2019 wages would continue as a \u201cpriority payment\u201d and said it had received \u201ca number of expressions of interest\u201d in the business.</p> <p>The Pensions Regulator is also investigating the BHS pension scheme to determine whether to take action to pursue those \u201cdeliberately attempting to avoid their pension obligations\u201d. Green has reportedly offered \u00a380m to help fill the pensions gap, but that will still leave a much larger deficit.</p> <p>Most of the cash and all of the property were part of the business that was being sold rather than the personal assets of the Green family.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>John Mann MP said Green should lose the title unless he pays back \u00a3400m in dividends extracted from BHS before its collapse.</p> <p>Vince Cable, business secretary from 2010 to 2015 who clashed with Green over his tax affairs, said: \u201cIf there are any questions about his conduct with the company then this isn\u2019t a matter about knighthoods \u2013 it\u2019s actually something that should be looked at by Companies House, whose specific role is to investigate the conduct of directors. That is where the debate should be.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy grew at the weakest pace in two years at the start of 2016 as consumer spending slowed, business investment plunged and exports declined further, the US Department of Commerce announced on Thursday. The US gross domestic product grew by just 0.5% in the first quarter, down from 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The news of disappointing GDP growth from January to March came as Barack Obama defended his economic legacy. \u201cI actually compare our economic performance to how, historically, countries that have wrenching financial crises perform,\u201d Obama told the New York Times magazine. \u201cBy that measure, we probably managed this better than any large economy on Earth in modern history,\u201d he said. Based on interviews with the president and other members of his administration, the magazine explored why even as Obama lauds the US economic successes many Americans feel left behind. Each month, even as the unemployment rate has dropped below 5%, officials at the US Department of Labor note that wages remain the \u201cunfinished business\u201d of the US recovery. US wages have remained largely stagnant as, on average, Americans are still earning the same wages they were in 1997 and 46.7 million of them are still living in poverty. Some of the blame, according to Obama, falls on the shoulders of the Republican-held Congress. Over the years, Obama has called on US lawmakers to increase the national minimum wage and pass an infrastructure bill, which was finally signed into law earlier this year. \u201cI can probably tick off three or four common-sense things we could have done where we\u2019d be growing a percentage or two faster each year,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe could have brought down the unemployment rate lower, faster. We could have been lifting wages even faster than we did. And those things keep me up at night sometimes.\u201d The new figures show that economic recovery slowed down in the first three months of this year. Thursday\u2019s GDP figures were the worst since early 2014, when the GDP contracted by 0.9%. \u201cIn the detail, all main parts of the economy slowed with the exception of the housing market, the latter probably reflecting low mortgage rates,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. \u201cBusiness spending fell at the fastest rate since the second quarter of 2009, dragged 5.9% lower by cost cutting in the energy sector in particular. Consumer spending growth also slid from 2.4% to 1.9% and exports fell at a 2.6% pace.\u201d Economists expected the GDP to grow by 0.7% in the first quarter. Since typically GDP growth is weaker in the beginning of the year but rebounds by spring, economist predict second quarter growth to be around 2%. The slowdown in economic conditions might delay the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to raise interest rates in the near future. On Wednesday, the Fed announced for a third time this year that it was not raising interest rates. In December, it raised rates from near zero for the first time in almost a decade. The Fed was initially expected to raise interest rates four times in 2016, a forecast that has since been adjusted to just two rate hikes this year. In the statement released on Wednesday, Fed officials noted that labor market conditions have improved \u201ceven as growth in economic activity appears to have slowed\u201d. \u201cGrowth in household spending has moderated, although households\u2019 real income has risen at a solid rate and consumer sentiment remains high,\u201d they wrote. Thursday\u2019s figures are preliminary and will be revised twice more. The first revision will be released at the end of May, more than two weeks before the Fed next meets to discuss interest rates. \u201cWorryingly, the surveys indicate that the malaise affecting the US economy has extended into the second quarter, albeit with the pace of expansion picking up slightly to 0.8%,\u201d said Williamson. \u201cWith the Fed facing only a small window of opportunity to hike interest rates before the election, such disappointing data for the second quarter raises the likelihood of any rate hike being pushed out until December, meaning the data for May could be all-important for the Fed.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "BHS collapse: Sir Philip Green may face grilling by MPs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell face being hauled in front of MPs to explain their management of BHS after an influential parliamentary committee launched an inquiry into the department store chain. The Commons Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) select committee has announced it will explore the sale and acquisition of BHS, including whether the directors of Green\u2019s Arcadia and Retail Acquisitions acted as best they could to fulfil their statutory duties. BHS called in administrators on Monday, putting almost 11,000 jobs at risk. The retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 last March to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Chappell. BHS\u2019s collapse has caused controversy because it has been saddled with a \u00a3571m pension deficit despite Green collecting more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership, with Retail Acquisitions receiving payments of more than \u00a325m from BHS over the last 13 months. Chappell, who had no experience of running a major retailer, also moved \u00a31.5m into an overseas company last week as it became clear that BHS was heading for administration. When asked to return the cash by BHS management, Chappell paid it back \u00a350,000 short, saying this represented the cost of transferring the money into Swedish kronor and back again. Iain Wright, the Labour MP and chairman of the BIS committee, said: \u201cThe collapse of BHS brings misery and uncertainty for thousands of workers and also places a potentially significant burden on the taxpayer in the form of pension liabilities. \u201cThe sale and acquisition of BHS raises real questions about whether directors acted in the best long-term interests of the company and their employees. \u201cIs there too much of an incentive in the system for owners to asset-strip, take out vast sums for personal gain, and then dump and run, leaving the taxpayer to pick up the tab when the company fails, rather than create value for the long term?\u201d Wright said that the inquiry will summon the lawyers, bankers and auditors who advised Green\u2019s retail group Arcadia and Retail Acquisitions on the sale of BHS last year. The full witness list will be decided in due course, he added. The Work and Pensions committee has launched a separate investigation into the impact on the state-backed Pension Protection Scheme from taking on the liabilities of BHS. It has already said it will call Green as a witness. The BIS committee intends to explore whether the directors of both companies did the \u201cbest they could to fulfil their statutory duties\u201d, and whether the regulations surrounding the statutory duties of directors and the consequences for breaching them are \u201csufficient\u201d in the UK. It will ask what due diligence was carried out by Retail Acquisitions and Arcadia before the deal and examine the steps taken by Green\u2019s company to ensure Retail Acquisitions was a responsible buyer. The administrators have confirmed they have received expressions of interest in buying the retailer, with more than 50 parties thought to have approached them. Philip Duffy, joint administrators, said: \u201cOver the last few days, we have been working hard to stabilise the business and are pleased to have received a number of expressions of interest. \u201cWe continue to seek a sale as a going concern. We appreciate the hard work of staff that have ensured that stores have continued to trade as normal. \u201cStaff have been paid over the course of [Wednesday and Thursday] and we want to reassure them that they will continue to be so while the group remains in administration, as a priority payment.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group, the UK\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, has revealed a surge in activity by buy-to-let and second-home buyers in the run-up to tax changes in April. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, chief executive of the bailed-out bank, said mortgage activity had been strong in the run-up to the changes, which came into force on 1 April and require buy-to-let and second-home buyers to pay a 3% surcharge on stamp duty. He was speaking as the bank, which owns Halifax, reported its profits had almost halved in the first three months of the year. Last month, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said there had been a 22% year-on-year rise in January in buy-to-let mortgages \u2013 although estate agents have warned they expect activity to slow down because of the EU referendum on 23 June. The London-focused chain Foxtons said on Wednesday it expected a \u201creduced sales pipeline\u201d in the coming three months. Horta-Os\u00f3rio said as the Bank of England had not increased interest rates from the record low of 0.5% he had started to pull back slightly from mortgage lending to focus on business lending. The low interest rate environment means he is also accelerating a plan, outlined in late 2014, to close around 200 branches \u2013 around 6% of the network \u2013 and axe a further 9,000 roles, on top of the 45,000 lost since the rescue of HBOS in 2008. The Lloyds finance director, George Culmer, said the bank was \u201cahead of plan on where we expected to be\u201d. Rather than the 46% fall in first quarter profits to \u00a3654m, Horta-Os\u00f3rio preferred to focus on the \u00a32.1bn in underlying profits. \u201cThese results demonstrate the strength of our differentiated, simple, low-risk business model and reflect our ability to actively respond to the challenging operating environment,\u201d he said. The UK government has had to postpone a plan to sell most of its remaining 9% stake to retail investors because of the plunge in bank shares since the start of the year. The shares were trading at 67.9p, down 2%, shortly after the Lloyds results were published, below the 73p average price at which the state\u2019s 43% stake was bought during the 2008 crisis. Sandy Chen, analyst at Cenkos, described the performance as \u201ca bit flat, as in deflated\u201d. The fall in profits was caused by a controversial plan to buy back \u00a33bn of debt, which is expected to reduce the bank\u2019s costs annually. The buy-back cost \u00a3790m in the first quarter, while other items including \u00a3161m of restructuring charges and \u00a3115m for possible compensation claims also knocked profits. The bad debt charge was down 6% to \u00a3149m. However, there was no new provision for payment protection insurance selling, a scandal which has so far cost the banking industry more than \u00a330bn, and \u00a316bn at Lloyds.",

      "bodyText": "WPP founder Sir Martin Sorrell has again defended his bumper pay package, saying shareholders had previously approved the advertising company\u2019s incentive plans by a substantial margin. Sorrell is likely to face anger from shareholders at the company\u2019s annual meeting in June after collecting a share award of nearly \u00a363m. In total, his remuneration for last year is estimated to reach \u00a370m, one of the biggest pay cheques in British corporate history. Full details will be revealed in the company\u2019s annual report on Friday. Sorrell, 71, who started the company by taking a stake in Wire and Plastics Products in 1985 and built it into a global advertising powerhouse, argued that his remuneration reflected the success of WPP. \u201cIt\u2019s really pay for performance over the long term, over 30-plus years,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Today programme. Sorrell dismissed comparisons to retail tycoon Sir Philip Green, under fire for paying himself and his family millions in dividends as the value of high street chain BHS plummeted, as \u201cspecious\u201d. The WPP chief said: \u201cBHS has gone out of business. We are very much in business.\u201d Sorrell\u2019s \u00a370m remuneration is believed to be the second-largest ever granted to a FTSE 100 chief executive, behind only the \u00a392m in shares and cash paid to Bart Becht while he was chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser in 2009. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m worth it or not,\u201d Sorrell said. \u201cShareholders will have a view \u2026 It\u2019s a very democratic process.\u201d He argued that the advertising firm\u2019s incentive plans had been approved by investors by a margin of four or five to one, although he added: \u201cShareholders can change their minds, I accept that.\u201d Asked whether he was embarrassed by his pay package, he replied: \u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed about the growth of the company from two people in one room in Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields in 1985 to 190,000 people in 112 countries and a leadership position in our industry \u2026 a world leader that\u2019s 50% bigger than its next competitor. I\u2019m not embarrassed about that success.\u201d Sorrell has faced other pay revolts \u2013 in 2012, almost 60% of investors opposed the pay deals for WPP\u2019s directors. This prompted the company to change the long-term bonus scheme, called Leap, to a less generous scheme that will come into force in 2018 and cap Sorrell\u2019s pay at less than \u00a320m, based on his existing salary. Sorrell was speaking from New York, as figures from WPP showed a strong start to the year, reporting revenues of \u00a33.1bn for the first quarter, up 3.2% on a like-for-like basis, with strong growth in the UK.",

      "bodyText": "The government should launch an investigation into Sir Philip Green\u2019s conduct as a company director if allegations emerge that he failed in his obligations while owning BHS, Sir Vince Cable, the former business secretary, has said. BHS shareholders led by Green, and the billionaire\u2019s family, withdrew more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans from the failed department store chain before he sold it for \u00a31 in March 2015. It collapsed into administration this week in a move that crystallised a \u00a3571m pensions deficit and has put 11,000 jobs at risk across the UK. \u201cThe question is whether the dividend payments were disproportionate,\u201d Cable told the Guardian. \u201cIt is a question of whether the return on shareholder capital that he was extracting from the company was unreasonable. Was it based on a cynical expectation the company would be forced into administration or was he just over-optimistic about BHS? If there is an allegation of Green\u2019s failure to observe his obligations as a director then it is a matter for investigation by the Insolvency Service.\u201d The Insolvency Service is a branch of government with the power to strike off company directors for up to 15 years and to mount criminal prosecutions. It is currently awaiting a report from BHS\u2019s administrators before deciding its next steps. The former cabinet minister\u2019s comments will increase pressure on Green, who is already facing calls to give up his knighthood which he was awarded under Tony Blair\u2019s government in 2006 for services to the retail industry. Labour MP John Mann has called on him to pay back \u00a3400m in dividends to help fill BHS\u2019s pensions black hole or lose the gong. Green has reportedly offered to pay \u00a340m as well as a \u00a340m loan. The government\u2019s Pensions Protection Fund, which is taking on the liability, is expected to pursue him for more than that. Green could not be reached for comment. Cable backed the plan of Frank Field MP, chairman of the Commons work and pensions committee, to call Green before MPs to explain the BHS transactions. Cable said if questions remained there should be an investigation. It would mark a sharp decline in relations between Green and successive governments. In 2010, Green was appointed by the Conservative cabinet office minister Francis Maude to review government efficiency. Maude hailed his \u201cimmense commercial experience and of course his fantastic track record at managing large organisations\u201d. Green\u2019s knighthood was signed off by Tony Blair in the 2006 Queen\u2019s birthday honours, eight months after he banked \u00a31.2bn, the biggest pay cheque in British corporate history. The huge dividend \u2013 more than four times the group\u2019s pre-tax profits \u2013 came from his Arcadia fashion business, which spans high street names including Top Shop and Burton. It was paid to his wife, Tina, the direct owner of Arcadia who lives in the tax haven of Monaco. Six months before his honour, Green angered unions by announcing that employees in the final-salary scheme at Arcadia would have to work five years longer to get their pensions, would not receive the same level of inflation-proofing and would have to hike their contributions to maintain benefits. The pensions deficit was a relatively small \u00a311.6m. He was also attacked by Labour Behind The Label, a pressure group calling for greater rights for textile workers. It criticised Arcadia\u2019s decision not to be a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative. \u201cArcadia group is way behind its major high street competitors when it comes to addressing the problems faced by workers making its products,\u201d the group said. \u201cPhilip Green has the power to have a real impact on the conditions in which our clothes are produced.\u201d The questions over Green\u2019s conduct came as the current owner of BHS, Dominic Chappell, said he was working with private US investors to put together a rescue package that would save a \u201csubstantial majority\u201d of the chain\u2019s 164 shops and continue the business under the BHS brand. \u201cThe pension deficit was weighing us down and not allowing us to move forward,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the administration, when the pensions side of the business is sorted out, we will be able to move on. I\u2019m working with US investors to buy a substantial majority of stores.\u201d Adminstrators appointed to run BHS are expected to report to the Insolvency Service on why the high street giant collapsed. They have the power to examine current directors\u2019 conduct, and that of previous directors, such as Green, who have been in office in the previous three years. If there are serious concerns that can be dealt with under civil law then the Insolvency Service can take action, including disqualify directors for anything up to 15 years. If it is a criminal matter, for example suspected fraud, it could refer it to the SFO or request permission from Sajid Javid, the business secretary, to investigate further and mount its own prosecution.",

    "webTitle": "UK house prices edge up 0.2% in April", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The average price of a UK home edged up by 0.2% in April, according to the UK\u2019s biggest building society, despite expectations that a busy start to the year would be followed by a sharp drop in demand. Nationwide said the average price paid for a property during the month had risen to a new high of \u00a3202,436, after breaking through the \u00a3200,000 barrier in March. The monthly rise was the lowest since November and brought the year-on-year rate of increase down to 4.9%, from 5.7% in March. The figures are based on mortgages approved and valued by the society during the month, adjusted to reflect the price of a \u201ctypical\u201d home. Lenders and estate agents all reported an increase in interest from buyers in the early part of 2016, as those looking for buy-to-let properties and other second homes tried to beat a change to stamp duty on 1 April. Since that date all property purchases other than a main home have attracted a three percentage point surcharge. Figures from HMRC showed that 165,000 transactions were registered during March \u2013 more than double the figure for the same month of 2015. Many commentators are predicting a drop in demand following the rush, and price falls in some parts of the country. Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, Robert Gardner, said: \u201cThis slowdown returns the annual pace of house price growth to the fairly narrow range between 3% and 5% that had been prevailing since the summer of 2015. \u201cIt may be that the surge in house purchase activity resulting from the increase in stamp duty on second homes from 1 April provided a temporary boost to prices in March.\u201d But while Gardner said house purchase activity was likely to fall in the coming months, particularly as buy-to-let lenders face another set of new tax rules in April 2017, other factors could drive prices up. \u201cIt is possible that the recent pattern of strong employment growth, rising real earnings, low borrowing costs and constrained supply will tilt the demand/supply balance in favour of sellers and exert upward pressure on price growth once again in the quarters ahead,\u201d he said. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the month-on-month increase was \u201ca strong result, given that the hike in stamp duty for buy-to-let and second home purchases kicked in at the start of the month\u201d. He added: \u201cAll of the other measures of house prices have been significantly stronger over the last six months than Nationwide\u2019s index, which is based on its mortgage offers and so may suffer from sampling issues. \u201cWe expect the Nationwide index to pick up at a faster rate over the coming months as falling mortgage rates, loosening credit constraints and rising wage growth bolster demand, while supply remains constrained.\u201d Separate figures from the Land Registry showed a 0.5% dip in prices in England and Wales in March, putting the average price at \u00a3189,901. The data, which is based on sales registered during the month and does not include new-build properties, showed an annual increase of 6.7%. Prices were down month-on-month in all regions except London and the south-east of England, the Land Registry said, with the biggest fall in Yorkshire &amp; the Humber, which recorded a 2.6% drop. In London, prices were up by 13.9% over 12 months, to an average \u00a3534,785 \u2013 five and a half times the average price of a home in the north-east, which fell by 0.7% over the year to \u00a397,581. Jonathan Hopper, managing director of buying agents Garrington Property Finders, said March\u2019s dip in prices was \u201clikely to presage a return to more normal rates of price growth rather than a serious slowdown in the market\u201d. He said: \u201cEven though its annual level of price growth remains close to 14%, London\u2019s extraordinary run of price rises has slowed dramatically as international buyers hold off on purchases until the Brexit uncertainty is past. \u201cElsewhere, levels of buyer confidence remain solid, but with the surge in purchases by buy-to-let buyers now over, sellers now need to think more carefully about pricing competitively,\u201d said Hopper. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said over the next few months the market would be affected by the EU referendum. \u201cWe expect housing market activity to regain limited momentum in the second half of 2016, on the assumption that a vote to stay in the EU reduces uncertainty and supports a pickup in economic activity,\u201d he said. \u201cA vote to leave the EU would be liable to see a marked hit to UK economic activity over the rest of this year and in 2017 amid heightened uncertainties, which would likely weigh down heavily on the housing market.\u201d",

Many commentators are predicting a drop in demand following the rush, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/house-prices-sales-fall-stamp-duty-brexit-election-rics\">and price falls in some parts of the country</a>.</p> <p>Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, Robert Gardner, said: \u201cThis slowdown returns the annual pace of house price growth to the fairly narrow range between 3% and 5% that had been prevailing since the summer of 2015.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/27/foxtons-braced-revenue-slump-rise-in-buy-to-let-stamp-duty\"> \u201cIt may be that the surge in house purchase activity resulting from the increase in stamp duty on second homes from 1 April provided a temporary boost to prices in March.\u201d</a></p> <p>But while Gardner said house purchase activity was likely to fall in the coming months, particularly as buy-to-let lenders face another set of new tax rules in April 2017, other factors could drive prices up.</p> <p>\u201cIt is possible that the recent pattern of strong employment growth, rising real earnings, low borrowing costs and constrained supply will tilt the demand/supply balance in favour of sellers and exert upward pressure on price growth once again in the quarters ahead,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the month-on-month increase was \u201ca strong result, given that the hike in stamp duty for buy-to-let and second home purchases kicked in at the start of the month\u201d. </p> <p>He added: \u201cAll of the other measures of house prices have been significantly stronger over the last six months than Nationwide\u2019s index, which is based on its mortgage offers and so may suffer from sampling issues. </p> <p>\u201cWe expect the Nationwide index to pick up at a faster rate over the coming months as falling mortgage rates, loosening credit constraints and rising wage growth bolster demand, while supply remains constrained.\u201d</p> <p>Separate figures from the Land Registry showed a 0.5% dip in prices in England and Wales in March, putting the average price at \u00a3189,901. The data, which is based on sales registered during the month and does not include new-build properties, showed an annual increase of 6.7%.</p> <p>Prices were down month-on-month in all regions except London and the south-east of England, the Land Registry said, with the biggest fall in Yorkshire &amp; the Humber, which recorded a 2.6% drop.</p> <p>In London, prices were up by 13.9% over 12 months, to an average \u00a3534,785 \u2013 five and a half times the average price of a home in the north-east, which fell by 0.7% over the year to \u00a397,581.</p> <p>Jonathan Hopper, managing director of buying agents Garrington Property Finders, said March\u2019s dip in prices was \u201clikely to presage a return to more normal rates of price growth rather than a serious slowdown in the market\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cEven though its annual level of price growth remains close to 14%, London\u2019s extraordinary run of price rises has slowed dramatically as international buyers hold off on purchases until the Brexit uncertainty is past.</p> <p>\u201cElsewhere, levels of buyer confidence remain solid, but with the surge in purchases by buy-to-let buyers now over, sellers now need to think more carefully about pricing competitively,\u201d said Hopper. </p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said over the next few months the market would be affected by the EU referendum. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe expect housing market activity to regain limited momentum in the second half of 2016, on the assumption that a vote to stay in the EU reduces uncertainty and supports a pickup in economic activity,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cA vote to leave the EU would be liable to see a marked hit to UK economic activity over the rest of this year and in 2017 amid heightened uncertainties, which would likely weigh down heavily on the housing market.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Risky deepwater drilling for oil in the Great Australian Bight is being assessed under a weak and secretive regulatory regime, the Senate has heard. Senators were also told the project would have a much smaller economic benefit than the industry had suggested. BP, the company responsible for the world\u2019s biggest oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, is seeking approval to drill for oil in the bight after its initial application was knocked back last year. The bight is a haven for whales, sea lions and other marine life. It supports a large fishing industry and much of it is covered by nature reserves. The Senate inquiry was told the assessment of BP\u2019s application to drill in the bight lacked transparency and was subject to weaker environmental requirements since the federal government devolved its approval process to an agency that dealt specifically with offshore oil and gas applications. The inquiry also heard the industry\u2019s estimate of the project\u2019s economic benefits were being exaggerated. According to a submission by BP, estimating the jobs and tax revenue the project might bring is difficult but offshore oil and gas projects in the Bass Strait \u201csustained tens of thousands of jobs as well as billions of dollars in tax revenue\u201d. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) also cited the Bass Strait ventures, saying they \u201ccontributed $200bn to Australian gross domestic product (GDP) and 50,000 permanent jobs over four decades\u201d. Economist Rod Campbell from the Australia Institute said the industry figures were vastly exaggerated. \u201cClaims that there are seriously large economic benefits or employment impacts to be had from such developments just aren\u2019t backed up by the statistics,\u201d he told the inquiry, which was instigated by independent Senator Nick Xenophon and Greens Senator Robert Simms. In a submission, Campbell said the oil and gas industry only directly employed 19,000 people around the country and the royalties the minerals, oil and gas industries had paid to South Australia were minimal \u2013 only $242m in 2014-15. Campbell pointed out that was less than the state received from car registration, which amounted to $388m that year. Campbell estimated a project in the bight could employ between 1,000 and 1,500 people. The chief executive of Appea, Malcolm Roberts, told the inquiry the Australia Institute\u2019s report was \u201cflimsy\u201d and the claims were based on \u201cmisleading comparisons\u201d. Roberts said the employment figure cited by the Australian Institute was based on a \u201cvery narrow\u201d definition of industry employment used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Campbell responded that \u201cblaming the ABS for somehow mismeasuring the impacts of the oil and gas industry just doesn\u2019t cut it from an economist\u2019s perspective\u201d. Campbell also noted that 6,800 people were employed by the tourism industry in the region and their jobs would be put at risk if an oil spill were to occur. Lawyers from the Environmental Defenders Offices of Australia (EDOA) told the inquiry the approval process was unduly secretive and had weaker environmental standards than required by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act, under which many other large projects are assessed. Under the federal government\u2019s \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d policy aimed at cutting \u201cgreen tape\u201d, approval of the project was devolved from the federal Department of the Environment to the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema). But as a result, key parts of BP\u2019s application were not available to the public and when the EDOA asked Nopsema to provide them, it mounted a legal challenge, Rachel Walmsley, the policy and law reform director of EDOA, told the inquiry. Documents including any modelling of potential oil spills and plans for how to clean them up were not publicly available, as they would be for projects assessed under the EPBC. Independent modelling of an oil spill commissioned by the Wilderness Society showed a spill could affect most of Australia\u2019s southern coastline, shutting down fisheries and threatening wildlife, including whales, seabirds and sea lions. \u201cBP must release all its documents about its plans to drill for oil in the pristine waters of the Great Australian Bight,\u201d said the Wilderness Society\u2019s South Australia director, Peter Owen, in a statement. \u201cThe public can have no trust in BP after the Gulf of Mexico disaster or in Australia\u2019s offshore oil and gas authority, Nopsema, which conducts its assessment in secret.\u201d BP and the Wilderness Society were set to appear before the inquiry later on Thursday.",

Campbell also noted that 6,800 people were employed by the tourism industry in the region and their jobs would be put at risk if an oil spill were to occur.</p> <p>Lawyers from the Environmental Defenders Offices of Australia (EDOA) told the inquiry the approval process was unduly secretive and had weaker environmental standards than required by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act, under which many other large projects are assessed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/26/bp-spending-cuts-profits-fall-80-percent-oil-prices\">BP prepares deeper spending cuts as profits fall 80%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under the federal government\u2019s \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d policy aimed at cutting \u201cgreen tape\u201d, approval of the project was devolved from the federal Department of the Environment to the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema).</p> <p>But as a result, key parts of BP\u2019s application were not available to the public and when the EDOA asked Nopsema to provide them, it mounted a legal challenge, Rachel Walmsley, the policy and law reform director of EDOA, told the inquiry.</p> <p>Documents including any modelling of potential oil spills and plans for how to clean them up were not publicly available, as they would be for projects assessed under the EPBC.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/09/bp-oil-spill-in-great-australian-bight-would-be-catastrophic-modelling-shows\">Independent modelling of an oil spill</a> commissioned by the Wilderness Society showed a spill could affect most of Australia\u2019s southern coastline, shutting down fisheries and threatening wildlife, including whales, seabirds and sea lions.</p> <p>\u201cBP must release all its documents about its plans to drill for oil in the pristine waters of the Great Australian Bight,\u201d said the Wilderness Society\u2019s South Australia director, Peter Owen, in a statement. \u201cThe public can have no trust in BP after the Gulf of Mexico disaster or in Australia\u2019s offshore oil and gas authority, Nopsema, which conducts its assessment in secret.\u201d</p> <p>BP and the Wilderness Society were set to appear before the inquiry later on Thursday. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Usually pre-budget leaks are all about giving people snippets of what will be contained in the treasurer\u2019s budget speech; this year, perhaps in keeping with the odd timing of the budget, the biggest leak has been about what will not be included \u2013 namely changes to capital gains tax or negative gearing. The government\u2019s overarching housing policy narrative is about aspiration \u2013 that we all want to get ahead and if we are not negative gearing now, we all aspire to do it one day. Essentially it is the replacement of the great Australian dream. Home ownership? Pfft. Buying one home isn\u2019t cool; you know what\u2019s cool? Buying multiple properties to negative gear. But aspiration is hard thing to measure \u2013 especially when it comes to home ownership. It is also worth remembering that 30% of Australian households are renters, for whom thinking about buying a second property is a very long way down the list of priorities. But now we have the treasurer and a prime minister standing with a couple talking about how they are negative gearing properties as an investment for their one-year-old daughter. We have the prime minister saying that it was \u201cbeside the point\u201d that most of the benefits of capital gains tax go to the top 10% of income earners because \u201cof course people on the highest incomes will make the highest gains because they tend to have more property\u201d. And we have government backbencher Alex Hawke on Sky News arguing, \u201cEverybody relies on property speculation, investment to generate their basic wealth \u2013 it\u2019s a fundamental of Australia\u2019s wealth creation\u201d. Yep \u2013 a government MP talking up property speculation. Cripes, someone send Hawke a copy of The Big Short. The ramp up in negative gearing talk has come not just from the government\u2019s announcement on the weekend, but also the timely release of the Grattan Institute\u2019s latest report on the topic, \u201cHot property: negative gearing and capital gains tax\u201d. The report addresses not just negative gearing but also the forgotten child of the housing affordability debate \u2013 capital gains tax. In reality it is changes to capital gains tax in 1999 that really set the fire under the housing market by turning negative gearing from a niche activity to one which the treasurer would suggest is a favourite of nurses and teaches and police officers \u2013 the archetypal \u201cmum and dad investors\u201d. Prior to 1999 capital gains were taxed at a real rate \u2013 the nominal return less the inflation rate over the period you owned the investment. The Howard government then changed it to taxing the nominal rate, but only for half the amount. At the time there was actually debate over whether or not this would lead to people paying more tax. Mark Latham \u2013 then on the opposition backbench \u2013 argued the change was \u201can open invitation for the tax minimisers, the tax avoiders and the capital speculators to do their worst in the Australian economy\u201d. And whatever you might think about Latham\u2019s more recent contributions to public debate, he sure as heck was on the money on this issue. Prior to the CGT changes, the number of rental properties that produced a loss were roughly equal with those that made a profit. But as soon as the changes came in, rental losses became much more attractive: The Grattan Institute\u2019s report released this week also shows the monetary impact of the changes \u2013 rental losses very quickly started outweighing the profits: The reason is the combination of the CGT discount and negative gearing made for a very attractive tax minimisation scheme. The tax system thus in effect encourages you to engage in \u201cdebt-financed and speculative investments\u201d because negative gearing enables you to minimize your current income and the CGT discount enables you to minimize the tax on your profit \u2013 because you get to choose when you sell your property. It\u2019s a combination that has produced an odd state of affairs where the Reserve Bank notes that \u201cin most countries the earning of rental income is seen as the most important reason for investing in rental properties ... This seems to stand in contrast to the situation in Australia.\u201d Ain\u2019t that the truth \u2013 and it is one that really can\u2019t be denied. There was no reason in the early 2000s for why suddenly landlords would start losing money on their rents \u2013 it was a purely driven by the changes to the capital gains tax \u2013 and the level of impact clearly demonstrates that the discount is too great. And yet we now have the government in effect arguing that not only is the distortion not a concern \u2013 it is something that should be encouraged. We also have the prime minister arguing that the ALP\u2019s proposed changes are attacks on economic freedom and that negative gearing \u201cis not a tax break, it is a standard concession.\u201d Please. No one has any issue with being able to deduct business expenses, but that is not what negative gearing is. Negative gearing is about deducting the interest costs of an investment property against income that has nothing to do with that investment. As the Grattan Institute notes, \u201cNegative gearing effectively converts wage income into more concessionally taxed capital gains\u201d And it does so in a manner that distorts the housing market and sees most of the benefits go toward the wealthiest. The Grattan Institute notes that 54% of the benefits from negative gearing goes towards the top 20% of taxpayers. But importantly, because negative gearing is used to reduce people\u2019s taxable income the report also notes that when you look at peoples\u2019 incomes before taking out the rental losses, the benefits are even more unequally distributed \u2013 with 47% going to the top 10% and 68% to the top 20%: The benefits of capital gains tax are even more weighted towards the wealthiest. The argy bargy over negative gearing often falls into who benefits. As the Guardian\u2019s Gareth Hutchens noted, essentially it breaks down to the opposition referring to percentages and the government wanting to use nominal figures (because while a greater percentage of surgeons who negative gear there are more nurses in total who do): But really the issue is of a tax policy that drastically changed people\u2019s habits towards minimising tax and had the side effect of setting fire to the housing market and leading to a massive spike in the level of housing debt: Over and above whether negative gearing or the capital gains tax benefit the wealthy (which they do) the issue is whether the tax policy has distorted Australia economy. It clearly has and as a result at the very least, the discount to capital gains tax needs to be reduced.",
