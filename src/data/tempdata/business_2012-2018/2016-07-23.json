      "bodyText": "All remaining BHS stores are to be closed permanently, with the formal announcement coming on the same day that Sir Philip Green is expected to receive stiff criticism from MPs for his role in the collapse of the retail chain. Administrator Duff &amp; Phelps will announce on Monday that the 114 BHS stores still in operation will close their doors for the final time by 20 August. Many stores will cease trading well before that date, according to Sky News, and about 50 stores have already closed. The decision means that a further 5,000 BHS workers will lose their jobs, on top of the 1,300 made redundant by previous closures. Much of the rest of the 11,000-strong workforce were employed at concessions within BHS stores, but only 1,000 of these employees will be offered positions elsewhere within Green\u2019s Arcadia group. Duff &amp; Phelps is expected to make the announcement on the day that MPs from the Commons work and pensions committee publish a report on BHS. They are expected to strongly criticise the actions of Green, who sold BHS for \u00a31 to Dominic Chappell in March 2015. Green has already faced criticism for taking large sums of money out of BHS before selling the company to Chappell, a three-time bankrupt, little more than 12 months before it failed with a \u00a3571m pension fund deficit. Last week, Green set out a robust defence of his stewardship of BHS, claiming that he put \u00a3421m into the group during his 15 years of ownership. However, the amount of capital investment highlighted by Green during his tenure is almost the same as the \u00a3423m paid in dividends to his family and other BHS shareholders between 2000 and 2004. Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, wrote to the BHS pension fund trustees last month insisting that Green must ensure benefits were restored to pensioners. They stand to get lower pensions following the collapse. The former BHS owner is thought to be hoping to strike a deal under which he could use cash lump sums to buy out members of the pension scheme who had savings of less than \u00a318,000. That would leave a small number of members who could transfer to a new scheme, potentially knocking hundreds of millions of pounds off Green\u2019s bill. Green\u2019s knighthood is under review following complaints about his management of BHS. The Cabinet Office confirmed in a letter to Labour MP Jim McMahon that it was looking into the matter following a number of calls for Green to be stripped of the honour. Duff &amp; Phelps, which has sold BHS\u2019s online and international operations to the Qatar-based Al Mana Group, declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "The overall impact of the historic referendum that saw the UK unexpectedly vote to leave the European Union has so far, in the space of a month, been less severe than some of the more apocalyptic warnings had suggested. But there have been winners and losers across the economy. The pound Sterling went on a rollercoaster ride on referendum night, ending up down 8% against the dollar as the results confirmed a victory for the Leave camp. Since then, its decline has continued and the pound is now at levels not seen since 1985, having lost about 12% against the US currency. Compared with the euro, the pound has fallen by 9% since the vote and is at a three-year low \u2013 making holidays in euroland more expensive. The decline comes as investors worry about weakness in the UK economy and the prospect of interest rate cuts to boost demand. This month the Bank of England left rates on hold but said most members of its monetary policy committee expected a cut in August if the economy did not improve. The weak pound is a boon to exporters but will make imported goods more expensive. On Thursday, Unilever \u2013 the business behind brands including Dove, Flora, Bertolli, Hellman\u2019s and Persil \u2013 became the first major food and consumer goods company to warn that companies were likely to pass on increased costs to customers. Stock markets Markets were caught by surprise by the Leave result and a record $2tn was wiped off the value of global shares. But since then, there has been something of a recovery, particularly for the FTSE 100, which has regained all lost ground and more, and is currently at 11-month highs. However, the leading UK index is chock-full of companies with international operations, which are less exposed to any slump in the UK economy, and which earn in dollars, thus gaining from the new lower exchange rate. The weak pound has also raised the prospect of UK-listed companies being snapped up by foreign rivals because suddenly they look cheap. Just last week chip designer ARM agreed to be taken over by Japan\u2019s SoftBank for \u00a324bn, while South African retailer Steinhoff has agreed to buy Poundland. Analysts believe more deals will follow. Markets have also been lifted by bargain hunters who believed valuations had fallen too far, as well as by the quick resolution to the political crisis threatening to engulf the government following Theresa May\u2019s appointment as prime minister. However, the mid-cap FTSE 250, which is more exposed to the UK economy than the 100 index, has yet to reach the level it was sitting at before the referendum result, despite recovering more than 13% from its lows. It is now down 2% from its pre-Brexit level. Housing market There has been a spate of profit warnings from estate agents, and many are making gloomy forecasts for the rest of the year. Agents in some upmarket parts of London have reported a bounce in interest from overseas buyers keen to take advantage of weak sterling, but for the mainstream market there are signs both interest and price growth have cooled. On Friday, LSL, Britain\u2019s second-biggest estate agent group \u2013 owner of Your Move and Marsh &amp; Parsons among others \u2013 said business had slowed since the vote and warned that its annual profits would be \u201csignificantly lower than anticipated\u201d. London-focused Foxtons issued a similar warning in late June. Forecasts for the rest of the year are for falling interest from buyers and price drops, particularly in the most expensive parts of the market. French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said last week that \u201ca price correction of even 40-50% in the most expensive London boroughs\u201d could be possible. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) says its members expect sales to slump over the summer, because buyer inquiries fell \u201csignificantly\u201d in June. Rics\u2019s findings were cited by the Bank of England when it announced that it was revising down its forecast for price rises. Housebuilders Shares in housebuilders lost around 40% of their value in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, with investors worried that an economic slowdown in the UK would hit their business, despite the country seeing record low interest rates. There has been some recovery since then, but the companies have failed to regain all their losses. Barratt Developments, Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilder, is still down around 28%, and it has said that it may build fewer homes because of the current uncertainty. Even before the vote, upmarket rival Berkeley had warned in June of a 20% drop in reservations of new homes. Commercial property The commercial property market was already stalling in the months running up to the referendum as investors put plans on hold to await the result. The UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU has not encouraged them back. Rics said last week that there had been \u201ca significant drop\u201d in confidence and demand among investors and tenants since the vote. \u201cBoth rent and capital value expectations are now in negative territory,\u201d it reported, adding that office and retail properties have been hardest hit. Funds invested in commercial property were forced to close their doors for a while, as panicked savers tried to withdraw their cash. Those barring withdrawals included funds run by Standard Life, M&amp;G Investments and Aviva Investors. Last week, they started to reopen for business, but some investors who want to get their money out will take a hit. Aberdeen Asset Management, for example, is adjusting payments downwards by 7%. Banks The banking sector has been hard hit by the Brexit fallout, thanks to a combination of low interest rates, worries about future access to European financial markets and the prospect of a general downturn. With expectations of another rate cut in August, the banks are braced for more strain on their stretched balance sheets, at the same time as the economy is slowing and the risk of bad debts is increasing. Moreover, so-called passporting arrangements, under which banks can sell financial products throughout Europe even though the UK is not part of the single currency, could come under threat after Brexit. Banks most exposed to the UK market have been hardest hit, with Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland down 25% and challenger bank Virgin Money falling 35%. Profit warnings Estate agents have been the only businesses to issue profit warnings following the Brexit vote. However, British Airways owner International Airlines Group was quick off the mark to say the uncertainty would hit demand, closely following by easyJet. Last week, the budget airline added that the fall in the pound had cost it \u00a340m. Other travel companies are also suffering as, along with increased concerns about terror attacks, they face the prospect of UK holidaymakers ditching more expensive overseas trips and staying at home. But executives at Heathrow airport said on Friday that the Leave vote had been good for business, with the falling pound encouraging international visitors to spend more in its shops, as well as making it easier to raise money from foreign investors. FIRST SIGNS OF ECONOMIC IMPACT The first real sign that Brexit is having an impact on the economy emerged last Friday, with a Markit survey showing business activity in services and manufacturing shrinking in July at its fastest rate since the global financial crisis in 2009. The data suggested that UK GDP could contract by 0.4% in the third quarter, according to Markit. Until then, the data had been equivocal. The International Monetary Fund, which before the referendum had warned of possible recession if the Leave campaign won, cut its forecast for UK growth in 2017 by 0.9% points to 1.3% from its April estimate. But that is still similar to its forecasts for Germany and France. A report from the Bank of England\u2019s regional agents last week showed that a majority of firms were not planning to mothball investment or change their hiring plans. The latest job figures looked upbeat: showing unemployment at its lowest level for more than a decade, with 31.7 million people in work in the three months to the end of May \u2013 176,000 more than for the three months to February 2016. On the high street, however, the volume of retail sales fell by 0.9% between May and June. This compared to a rise of the same amount in the previous three months, and showed the effect of falling consumer confidence in the run-up to and immediate aftermath of the EU vote. This was backed up by a survey from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG showing retail sales in the three months before the vote at their weakest for seven years, while market research group GfK recorded the biggest slide in consumer confidence for 21 years in a one-off poll following the referendum. Inflation is on the rise, with official figures showing that dearer air fares and driving costs helped to push the consumer price index up by 0.5% in the year ending in June, up from 0.3% previously. With higher prices on the way after the Brexit vote, inflation could breach its 2% target during 2017.",

      "bodyText": "The crown jewel of Britain\u2019s technology sector might be heading to Japan via a \u00a324bn takeover but it seemed to be business as usual in ARM Holdings\u2019 home city of Cambridge, bathed in summer sunlight. The Science Park was buzzing with young executives, the river punts overflowing with tourists and the college buildings as beautiful as ever. Scratch the surface of \u201cSilicon Fen\u201d, however, and there is significant unease \u2013 and not only about the planned purchase of ARM by SoftBank. Cambridge has been suffering enormous growth tensions for some time and has been served up with a Brexit vote it did not want, as well as absorbing another huge corporate asset grab. \u201cThis [the ARM deal] is a symptom of the country being financially broke and all our means of wealth are being plundered by the rest of the world,\u201d said Peter Dawe, one of the area\u2019s former technology titans, who sold his own early internet business Unipalm in 1995 for \u00a3150m. \u201cAt least SoftBank is one of the better people to buy [ARM] because they don\u2019t already have a department they want to absorb it into. If it was Apple or another Silicon [Valley] manufacturer, they would just be buying the intellectual property and let the management and engineers wither on the vine.\u201d Hermann Hauser, another big name in the local technology firmament and a founder of ARM\u2019s predecessor Acorn, was also disconsolate: \u201cARM is the proudest achievement of my life. The proposed sale to SoftBank is a sad day for me and for technology in Britain,\u201d he tweeted. He believed the takeover meant the \u201cdetermination of what comes next for technology will not be decided in Britain any more but in Japan\u201d. However, Mike Lynch, who made \u00a3500m from selling his Autonomy business to Hewlett Packard five years ago, was more upbeat. \u201cYes, we have sold the family silver,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s an amazing achievement to get what is effectively half the value of Intel\u201d \u2013 one of the biggest global technology companies. \u201cIt reinforces the fact that you can do it here, in Cambridge.\u201d Unsurprisingly, Simon Segars, the chief executive of ARM, agreed with Lynch, saying the SoftBank acquisition was entirely positive because it will \u201caccelerate our growth\u201d. It is certainly good personally for the chief technology officer, Mike Muller, whose stake is valued at \u00a321m, and Segars, who joined ARM in 1991 as its 16th employee and whose shares are now worth \u00a311m. The Sussex University-educated electrical engineer, who once described ARM as \u201cthe least glamorous company in the FTSE\u201d, said there was no question of ARM leaving its Cambridge home, where it is in the midst of a major new office construction project. Segars said: \u201cWe are not going anywhere. We are the product of Cambridge roots, where our headquarters is, but it will remain a global company.\u201d SoftBank, whose operations cover telecoms, the internet and robot technology, has promised to double the UK workforce from 1,600 and keep that East Anglian base. Segars says these commitments will be nailed down in legal documents but he has no reason to believe these agreements would be broken \u2013 even if Brexit makes it harder to employ skilled European staff. ARM is the third world-beating technology company in the past five years to be born in Cambridge and transfer to foreign parentage. The same fate befell Autonomy and CSR, while the smaller but hi-tech Domino Printing was sold last year to Japan too. ARM is particularly significant because it is at the heart of the much-vaunted \u201cinternet of things\u201d. Its self-designed microchips are used in 95% of smartphones, including iPhones, but also in TVs, drones and smart cars. The controversial deal with SoftBank has certainly been an early test for the new Conservative government, which promised to block foreign takeovers if they harmed the public interest. This one was waved through, with Chancellor Philip Hammond quick to present the deal as a positive. It showed \u201cthat Britain has lost none of its allure to international investors,\u201d he argued. \u201cBritain is open for business \u2013 and open to foreign investment.\u201d But these are difficult days for Silicon Fen, whose leaders have complained that growth is being stifled by poor transport connections and insufficient housing. The chamber of commerce, university and local councils last year produced a \u201cCase for Cambridge\u201d, explaining \u201cwhy urgent government action is needed if the city is to continue to thrive\u201d. Employers boast there are 4,500 knowledge-intensive companies registered within 25 miles of Cambridge. This is producing annual employment growth of 7.4% \u2013 faster than China, they say. They want more than 35,000 houses to be built and investment poured into roads and rail to keep Cambridge up to speed with rival tech centres such as San Francisco and Boston. Silicon Fen, named in honour of the Californian valley that spawned Apple, Google and others, has grown in the middle of what is still largely a farming region. Once a sleepy market town with a major academic institution at its heart, Cambridge is now about computer technology and biosciences as well. Much of this new industry has been spun from the still world-leading university, which has produced 90 Nobel prizewinners in little more than a century. The city is also home to a raft of internationally renowned science centres such as the MRC Laboratory for Molecular Biology, the Babraham Institute for immunology and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute for genomic research. Pharma giant AstraZeneca is building a huge new \u00a3330m headquarters next to Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus. Overall, the city grandees believe that around 45,000 new jobs can be created and the government has offered a City Deal to put in place the transport infrastructure to cope. But moves to cut down trees and make fast busways have caused tension in the close-knit communities that make up the city. Residents\u2019 associations have accused the assembly that oversees the City Deal of prioritising the transport needs of employers over those of inhabitants. Social justice groups say a huge rise in house prices is keeping key workers such as teachers and nurses out of the city. Those forced to live in nearby villages must join the queues of 87,000 cars a day commuting into the centre. And while the city council has a target of 40% of new housing being made \u201caffordable\u201d, the local paper has highlighted examples where developers have beaten this figure down to single-digit levels. The fast economic growth of Cambridge has made it, in the eyes of its supporters, part of a \u201cgolden triangle\u201d of success with Oxford and London. But some of the key problems \u2013 inequality, unaffordable housing and congested roads \u2013 are also replicated in all three cities. The Cambridge Cluster has been built on attracting the best brains from around the world, and the Brexit vote has sent shockwaves through a city that voted overwhelmingly in favour of Remain. Peter Williamson, honorary professor of international management at the university\u2019s Judge Business School, said technology companies by necessity look worldwide and there were already signs that EU-funded research projects are nervous about including UK scientists. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything positive and quite a lot negative about Brexit for the Cambridge Cluster. ARM never really had a UK customer base and always needed partners from overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cARM succeeded because it was born global.\u201d He also quibbled with the government\u2019s idea that the deal somehow represented inward investment, and said any inability of SoftBank to attract new international staff to ARM could test its resolve to scale up in Britain. Dawe \u2013 a Brexiter \u2013 sees it differently. \u201cThere may be short-term pain for university departments who have been subjugated by Brussels on research funding. But if we continue to look globally and have the right local management, Silicon Fen can grow faster and in a way that does not make local living conditions worse.\u201d But no doubt most Silicon Fenners would have agreed more with the sentiments of Hauser, who tweeted on referendum night: \u201cAn innumerate clown has wrecked a country \u202a#Brexit\u201d. ARM\u2019S HISTORY ARM was founded in November 1990 as Advanced Risc Machines. It was a joint venture between Cambridge-based Acorn Computers, US giant Apple and its Silicon Valley sister, VLSI Technology. Based in a converted barn in Cambridge, the ARM team created microprocessor chips that were used in Apple\u2019s Newton device, the first handheld computer, which was a commercial flop. But Newton showed small portable computers had potential. ARM chips went on to be utilised in a wide variety of smartphones, including Apple\u2019s iPhone, and are now said to be used in about 95% of smartphones worldwide. From an estimated 9 million units in 1997, ARM\u2019s partners shipped 15 billion chips last year. ARM now has nearly 4,000 employees working in 35 offices, from East Anglia to Silicon Valley to Shenzhen in China.",
