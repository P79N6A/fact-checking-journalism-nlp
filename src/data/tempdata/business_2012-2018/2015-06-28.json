      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 2am in Greece now, and round midnight in the UK. So that might be a good time to wrap up, so we can tackle another huge day on Monday. Here\u2019s our front-page story about today\u2019s drama: Read it all here: Thank you, as ever, for reading and commenting. It\u2019s been a wild weekend. See you shortly. GW All over Athens people have been queuing tonight, but the lines outside the National Bank branches were by some distance the longest, reports Jon Henley. And that\u2019s because the National Bank supplies the banknotes, and lots of other Greek banks, by midnight on Sunday, had no more of those. \u201cPeople are feeling very concerned \u2026 very insecure,\u201d said Maria Poulimeniou, outside the National Bank on Eleftherios Venizelos street in Kallithea, a southern Athens suburb. \u201cThe situation changes from one minute to the next. First they say the banks will be closed on Monday, now for the whole week.\u201d Pouleminou, who works in the finance department of a shipping company, said she had tried the local branch of her bank, Alpha, but \u201cthey had nothing left. Empty. So I\u2019m here. I\u2019m taking out the limit \u2013 \u20ac600, it is here. But they say after midnight it will be \u20ac60. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a queue.\u201d While Greece\u2019s government announced on Sunday night that the country\u2019s banks would not open on Monday, that capital controls would be introduced and limits set on withdrawals, there was no official confirmation yet of what those limits would be. But there were at least 70 people queuing outside this one branch, and most National Bank branches on the way back into town had similar lines. As their debt-laden, all but insolvent country \u2013 and the eurozone \u2013 entered uncharted territory last night, it seemed plenty of Greeks were taking no chances.\u201cI\u2019m not taking out all I have,\u201d said Stathis, 58, who described himself as a private sector employee. \u201cBut the government has just said the banks will stay shut for a week, so I\u2019m here to take out what I need for that \u2013 maybe a couple of hundred euros.\u201d He was quite clear about who he though was responsible. \u201cWe should never even have tried to negotiate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever the government did, I think we would probably have ended up exactly where we are right now. This whole thing has been planned, from the start, by the Germans.\u201d Yannis, a postgraduate finance student, was more phlegmatic. \u201cI just want to withdraw what I can now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s far from clear to me when we will be able to take money out again. I\u2019m aiming for \u20ac300 \u2013 enough for at least a week, I hope.\u201d But he said he had \u201cno idea\u201d what would happen after that. \u201c(Prime minister Alexis) Tsipras says he\u2019ll be able to go back to Brussels in a better position after this referendum, and reopen negotiations with the institutions from a position of strength...But nobody knows if that will be the case. Nobody knows anything, in fact.\u201d Anna, 63, a pensioner, wanted to make clear she was not standing in a bank queue just before midnight because she had panicked. \u201cLook,\u201d she said. \u201cI had no cash, and I obviously need some. My pension has just been paid, and I\u2019m here with my neighbout to take some of it out. Not all of it \u2013 just some. That\u2019s all. I\u2019m not scared, not in the least. We\u2019ve seen worse, here. We will come through this.\u201d The Big, Big question isn\u2019t whether shareholders lose money. It is whether investors are still confident that debt issued by Italy, Spain, Portugal, et al is safe. Three years ago, Mario Draghi calmed the crisis by vowing to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to save the euro. We are about to find out if people believe him. Sam Tuck, a senior currency strategist at ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd, has told Bloomberg that we\u2019re entering a \u201cvery very volatile\u201d time. \u201cThe knee-jerk reaction is for flight out of the euro and into safety. Defaulting to the IMF tomorrow looks like a certainty and when that happens there is no proposal, there is no legal mandate for Europe to bail out Greece. There are a whole bunch of unknown unknowns.\u201d Analysts at RBC Capital Markets confirm that traders will be racing for safety on Monday, and watching Greece very, very closely. Here\u2019s their early take: In the early hours of Saturday, the PM announced plans for a referendum. Events have accelerated since then. The euro is trading significantly weaker at the Asia open (spot 1.0970) and risk aversion seems likely to dominate the day ahead As the week progresses, if polls point to a Yes vote and more clarity emerges regarding what happens after the programme expires on Tuesday, that initial market reaction may soften. The day ahead is quiet for scheduled data leaving focus squarely on Greece. Remember, when stock market traders switched off their machines on Friday night, there was broad confidence that Saturday\u2019s eurogroup meeting might bring a Greek deal closer. Instead, Alexis Tsipras announced his shock referendum plan as Europeans headed to bed - leaving investors watching the crisis unfold, but unable to reach. Until now. Oh Goodness Me. Global stock markets are just getting into gear for the new week, and it\u2019s already clear that shares are going to fall sharply on Monday morning. The future\u2019s market is predicting that the main US stock markets could fall by close to 2%. European indices are also going to be hit very hard, judging by IG\u2019s futures market: Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, has written about how Greece\u2019s crisis could be even more serious than some people recognise. He\u2019s dubbing it a \u201cSarajevo moment\u201d for the eurozone - whose full consequences aren\u2019t quite apparent yet, but which are truly seismic. Here\u2019s a flavour: A fully fledged monetary union has the means to transfer resources from one region to another. This is what happens in the US or the UK, for example, with higher taxes in areas that are doing well being redistributed to areas with slower growth and higher unemployment. The euro, however, was constructed along different lines. Countries were allowed to join even though it was clear they would struggle to compete with the better performing nations such as Germany. A stability and growth pact designed to ensure a common set of budget controls was a poor substitute for fiscal union. From the start, it was obvious that the only mechanism for a country that ran into severe difficulties would be harsh austerity. Greece is the result of what happens when politics is allowed to override economics. If Greece leaves, the idea that the euro is irrevocable is broken. Any government that runs into difficulties in the future will have the Greek option of devaluation as an alternative to endless austerity. Just as importantly, the financial markets will know that, and will pile pressure on countries that look vulnerable. That\u2019s why Greece represents an existential crisis for the eurozone. It will be said in response that Greece is a small, insignificant country and that the single currency has much better defences than it had at the last moment of acute trouble in the summer of 2012. Diplomats in Europe\u2019s capitals took very much the same view in late June 1914. The euro is continuing to be pummelled in early trading in Asia -- it has now shed almost two cents against the US dollar. Sky\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway sums it up: Alastair Winter, chief economist at City firm Daniel Stewart, fears Greece is now certain to leave the eurozone. He believes that Greece\u2019s creditors have been angling to trigger the formation of a government of national unity, which would accept the measures they proposed. But even if that happened, other European parliaments might not back such a deal (the Bundestag could be particularly unreceptive). Winter adds that other eurozone governments could come under threat too: In the meantime, the Greek government is likely to run out of money to pay pensions and public sector salaries: it has already stopped paying suppliers, many of which are going bust, and businesses and individual taxpayers are withholding their dues. In other words, Grexit is inevitable even if the timing and mechanics are far from clear and it appears that the EuroGroup et al are decreasingly uncomfortable with that outcome. How long, however, before the domino theories of other exits start to circulate? Here\u2019s the moment that Greece officially entered the era of capital controls tonight, as Alexis Tsipras addressed the nation. Helpfully there are English subtitles too. Macedonia, the Balkan state to the north of Greece, has instructed its banks to take action to protect themselves from the Greek crisis. The central bank of Macedonia has told commercial banks to \u201cwithdraw all deposits and loans from banks situated in Greece and their branches around the world.\u201d It also asked them to take \u201cpreventative measures\u201d to limit the flow of capital to Greece. It said the move was \u2018temporary\u201d, and designed to protect the Macedonian system from disruption. More here on Reuters. The rumour mill keeps turning tonight -- the Kathimerini newspaper says that the Athens stock market may also stay closed until the referendum has been held. Eurozone leaders and finance ministers have been insistent recently that the world economy is better placed than in 2012 to handle the Greek debt crisis. And it\u2019s true that the ECB does have much more tools to hand -- including the ability to buy up unlimited quantities of government bonds if a country risks loses market access (through Mario Draghi\u2019s OMT programme). But the potential implications of a Greek default and disorderly exit from the single currency are still serious. The Greek governments\u2019 total debt pile is around \u20ac320bn. Plus, there is commercial bank lending to consider. As our data editor Alberto Nardelli explains, eurozone banks have put their toes back into the Greek water as the crisis eased: German banks\u2019 claims on Greece, which dropped to \u20ac3.9bn at the end of 2012 after having peaked at above \u20ac30bn just two years earlier, were back to \u20ac10.6bn at the end of last year. Although at a reduced scale, Dutch and Italian banks have also seen their exposure increase over the same time period. The aggregate claims of French banks remain relatively low, compared with an exposure that was higher than \u20ac50bn five years ago. The closure of banks for a week, and the imposition of tough ATM limits, is particularly tough on those with little spare cash to hand: Tomorrow\u2019s front pages are coming in, and Greece gets top spot in the FT (again...) The White House has confirmed that Barack Obama weighed in on the eurozone crisis today, in a call with Angela Merkel: AFP has the details: US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday agreed that Greece needed to find its way back to a path of reform without exiting the eurozone, the White House said. In a telephone call about the unfolding crisis, Obama and Merkel \u201cagreed that it was critically important to make every effort to return to a path that will allow Greece to resume reforms and growth within the eurozone,\u201d the White House said. Obama and Merkel said their teams of economic advisors were closely monitoring the rapidly changing situation, the statement said. Here\u2019s another queue for ATM machine in central Athens: Greeks continue to flock to cash machines tonight, in response to tonight\u2019s announcement of capital controls. Reuters is reporting tonight that Greece\u2019s financial stability council recommended that ATMs should be closed on Monday, and that the \u20ac60 limit would then kick in on Tuesday. That\u2019s according to a source. I cannot find an official announcement detailing the capital controls, I\u2019m afraid. And a recommendation isn\u2019t necessarily enacted. Here\u2019s the snaps: * 28-Jun-2015 20:49:00 - GREEK FINANCIAL STABILITY COUNCIL RECOMMENDED DAILY CASH WITHDRAWAL LIMIT OF 60 EUROS AS OF TUESDAY, ATMS CLOSED MONDAY- SOURCE* 28-Jun-2015 20:51:22 - FOREIGN BANK CARD HOLDERS WILL BE ALLOWED TO WITHDRAW MAXIMUM LIMIT SET BY THEIR BANKS- SOURCE* 28-Jun-2015 20:53:57 - FOR CAPITAL CONTROL MEASURES TO TAKE EFFECT GREEK CABINET MUST APPROVE COUNCIL RECOMMENDATIONS, PRESIDENTIAL DECREE NEEDED The BBC\u2019s Joe Lynam, though, reports that there is talk of a rather higher limit - at \u20ac200 per day. So the picture remains murky. Another report that ATM limits will be pegged to \u20ac60/day -- it\u2019s a confusing picture right now. I\u2019d got used to not seeing riot police outside the Athens parliament. But they\u2019re back there tonight, guarding the entrance, as hundreds of anti-austerity protesters rally in Syntagma Square Arrivals at Athens airport tonight get an early taste of the situation in Greece: Over in Athens, Greece\u2019s governing Syriza party has now issued an appeal for Greeks to attend a mass rally in Syntagma Square on Monday night to say \u201cNO\u201d to austerity. Helena Smith reports The radical leftists are urging Greeks to rally under the banner: \u201cThe Greek people cannot be blackmailed - cannot be terrorised. Defend Democracy.\u201d The appeal said: \u201cOn the 5th of July we will say OXI (NO) to austerity. We will say OXI to the lenders\u2019 ultimatums. We will say NO to the abolishment of democracy. We will participate in tomorrow\u2019s rally and send a strong message of pride, hope and dignity to Greece and Europe,\u201d The Euro has just plunged at the start of trading in Asia, as the financial markets finally get an opportunity to react to the last 48 hours. The single currency immediately fell 1.5% to $1.101, down from $1.116 on Friday evening. Two nights ago, traders though that Saturday was going to yield a short-term bailout extension for Greece. Greeks will be restricted to taking out just \u20ac60 per day for the next week, and that banks won\u2019t reopen until July 7 -- two days after the referendum has been held. That\u2019s a staggeringly small level -- suggesting that Greece\u2019s banks have been drained all-but-dry by the withdrawals this weekend. The leader of Greece\u2019s largest opposition party has urged Alexis Tsipras to abandon his plan for a referendum. Antonis Samaras, of New Democracy, said Tsipras should consider a national unity government instead: \u201cOur country needs to remain in the heart of Europe and in the euro. Mr Tsipras must continue the negotiations. If he can\u2019t do that by himself, he should attempt a big national consensus.\u201d Louka Katseli, the Yale-trained chairwoman of the National Bank of Greece, has also called for calm. Speaking just before Tsipras\u2019s address, she told Skai TV that: \u201cThese are unprecedented moments that we are living in\u201d Foreign minister Nikos Kotzias is reported to have summoned foreign ambassadors to his office to discuss developments too. A protest has taken place in Athens tonight, calling for Greece to vote NO to Sunday\u2019s referendum, and head towards the exit door from the EU. There are also reports tonight that President Obama has weighed in, telling Angela Merkel to avoid Greece crashing out of the single currency bloc. The US Government has been watching events in the eurozone with growing alarm. And it has now revealed that Treasury secretary Jack Lew spoke with the IMF, Germany and France on Saturday, and urged a resolution to keep Greece in the euro area. Lew also told them that the issue of Greek debt relief must be discussed (as the IMF also argues) Le Monde journalists Adea Guillot has also spotted queues building up at a cash machine, as Greeks respond to the news that capital controls are being imposed. (Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s famous Inaugural Address in 1933, of course) Tsipras\u2019s team are tweeting the key points from his speech tonight: People are still queueing at Greece\u2019s cash machines tonight, reports my colleague Jon Henley in Athens. Tsipras also said he has repeated his request for a bailout extension, beyong the 30 June deadline. That would give the ECB the right to restore emergency liquidity, he adds. It\u2019s official, capital controls are being imposed in Greece, as the financial crisis takes an even more alarming turn tonight. Speaking on live TV, Alexis Tsipras is saying that the Greek central bank has been forced to recommend a bank holiday and the introduction of capital controls. He blames the ECB, and other institutions, for trying to obstruct the democratic referendum he has called for next Sunday. This is a \u201cinsult\u201d that shames European democracy, he says. Tsipras also appeals for calm, and he insists that bank deposits are secure. More to follow Here\u2019s our latest news story on the unfolding financial crisis in Greece: Journalists are gathered outside the PM\u2019s residence, to await the end of the cabinet meeting -- and presumably an announcement on capital controls from Alexis Tsipras/ A few photos of ministers arriving at tonight\u2019s emergency cabinet meeting: This turn of events comes just hours after Greece\u2019s finance minister tweeted that the government opposed the \u2018very concept\u2019 of capital controls within a monetary union. As we covered this morning, Varoufakis also said it would be a failure of European democracy if the eurozone didn\u2019t allow Greece\u2019s banks to keep running. According to the FT, Greece is planning to impose limits on bank transfers, cash machine withdrawals, cheque cashing, and early access to money stores in fixed-term deposits. A wide range of capital controls, in other words. The FT says: Officials said the bank closure would last for several days and would be accompanied by limits yet to be announced on bank transfers abroad and withdrawals from cash machines. The cashing of cheques would be halted and fixed term deposits would be locked down. The Athens stock exchange was also set to be closed. The day\u2019s events followed the surprise move by the Greek government to call a referendum on new bailout terms offered by the country\u2019s international creditors, triggering a rupture with Athens\u2019 eurozone partners and pushing the country closer to exiting the single currency. The closure of Greece\u2019s banks (assuming it\u2019s confirmed) looks like a winding blow to the country\u2019s tourism sector. It surely damages hopes that tourists could help drag the country out of recession soon. The decision to keep Greece\u2019s banks closed was probably inevitable, once the European Central Bank decided this morning that it would not provide any more emergency funding (statement here) By not raising the ELA limits, the ECB left the Greek banking sector with insufficient resources to cope if large numbers of savers tried to withdraw funds. There are reports that the Greek banking sector could remain closed all week, until Sunday\u2019s referendum has been held. The Athens stock market won\u2019t open tomorrow morning either. Greece\u2019s finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, and central bank governor Yannis Stournaras, have told reporters that they have made a \u201crecommendation\u201d to the Greek government. GREEK FINANCE MINISTER SAYS WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATION TO GREEK CABINET THAT WILL BE ANNOUNCED LATER* GREEK CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR SAYS ANNOUNCEMENTS TO FOLLOW CABINET MEETING That cabinet meeting is starting now, and there is talk that prime minister Tsipras will address the nation afterwards. His second pronouncement in 48 hours, following the decision to call a referendum. Bloomberg is also reporting that Greece\u2019s banks won\u2019t open tomorrow: Greece ordered its banks shut Monday to avert a financial collapse after the European Central Bank froze emergency loans to the nation\u2019s lenders. Piraeus Bank SA Chief Executive Officer Anthimos Thomopoulos spoke to reporters after meeting the government\u2019s financial-stability panel in Athens on Sunday. We\u2019re seeing news flashes that Greek banks will not open on Monday, according to the head of Piraeus Bank. That follows today\u2019s meeting of the Greek financial stability council this afternoon, which just broke up. The Greek Financial Stability Council Meeting has just ended, Reuters reports. A Greek solidarity rally has been called for 6pm Monday evening in Trafalgar Square. French President Francois Hollande has called a cabinet meeting for 8am BST on Monday to discuss Greece, Reuters flags up. The British government has updated its advice to people travelling to Greece, to include a warning that cash machines might run short of funds, with little warning. The new advice says (I\u2019ve bolded up the extra line) The currency of Greece is the euro. When travelling outside of the UK, you should take more than one means of payment with you (cash, debit card, credit card).Visitors to Greece should be aware of the possibility that banking services \u2013 including credit card processing and servicing of ATMs \u2013 throughout Greece could potentially become limited at short notice. Make sure you have enough Euros in cash to cover emergencies, unforeseen circumstances and any unexpected delays. (we posted the original advice this morning) Ladbrokes, the betting firm, has slashed the odds of Greece voting YES in next Sunday\\s referendum to just 1/3 (so you\u2019d get \u20ac4 back for every \u20ac3 you put on). Yesterday, when it opened the book, it was offering 2/1 on YES and only 1/3 on NO. But now, the position has been reversed: Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said: \u201cAt first we thought the Greek public would dig their heels in, but there appears to have been a u-turn in sentiment and should the referendum go ahead a \u2018yes\u2019 outcome is looking more and more likely.\u201d Greek media are reporting that Alexis Tsipras has called a cabinet meeting in an hour\u2019s time: A group of UK left-leading MPs, union chiefs and charity leaders have signed a letter today calling for a debt relief conference for Greece, and an end to austerity: It says: We call on David Cameron to support the organisation of a European conference to agree debt cancellation for Greece and other countries that need it, informed by debt audits and funded by recovering money from the banks and financial speculators who were the real beneficiaries of bailouts. We believe there must be an end to the enforcing of austerity policies that are causing injustice and poverty in Europe and across the world. We urge the creation of UN rules to deal with government debt crises promptly, fairly and with respect for human rights, and to signal to the banks and financiers that we won\u2019t keep bailing them out for reckless lending.

There\u2019s a petition to cancel Greece\u2019s debts here, too. Failed to mentioned this earlier, sorry, but Greece\u2019s finance minister has released the text of his \u2018intervention\u2019 at yesterday\u2019s eurogroup. It shows that Yanis Varoufakis tried to persuade colleagues that a referendum made sense, as well as being democratic. He said: Colleagues, the referendum solution is optimal for all, given the constraints we face. If our government were to accept the institutions\u2019 offer today, promising to push it through Parliament tomorrow, we would be defeated in Parliament with the result of a new election being called within a very long month \u2013 then, the delay, the uncertainty and the prospects of a successful resolution would be much, much diminished. But even if we managed to pass the institutions\u2019 proposal through Parliament, we would be facing a major problem of ownership and implementation. Put simply, just as in the past the governments that pushed through policies dictated by the institutions could not carry the people with them, we too would fail to do so. The full intervention is worth a read to understand what happened yesterday afternoon: Vodafone, the telecommunications giant, says it plans to keep operating in Greece for the long term. A spokesman tells us: \u201cVodafone has been committed to Greece for the past 20 years and plans to stay committed for the next 20 years.\u201d JUST IN: A statement from Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, just landed in our inboxes. Lagarde is reiterating that the IMF believes Greece\u2019s debt sustainability needs to be addressed -- code for saying that the eurozone must put more money up. And the Fund is still prepared to work with both sides. Lagarde says: \u201cI have briefed the IMF Executive Board on the inconclusive outcome of recent discussions on Greece in Brussels. I shared my disappointment and underscored our commitment to continue to engage with the Greek authorities. \u201cThe coming days will clearly be important. I welcome the statements of the Eurogroup and the European Central Bank to make full use of all available instruments to preserve the integrity and stability of the euro area. These statements underscore that the euro area today is in a strong position to respond to developments in a timely and effective manner, as needed. \u201cThe IMF also will continue to carefully monitor developments in Greece and other countries in the vicinity and stands ready to provide assistance as needed. \u201cI continue to believe that a balanced approach is required to help restore economic stability and growth in Greece, with appropriate structural and fiscal reforms supported by appropriate financing and debt sustainability measures. The IMF is prepared to continue to pursue that approach with the Greek authorities and our European partners.\u201d Apparently, somewhere in that pile of bodies is the Greek finance minister and the country\u2019s central bank governor. They must be heading into that meeting to discuss Greece\u2019s financial stability. The seven-page draft proposal released by the Commission don\u2019t appear to contain any clear reference to addressing Greece\u2019s debt sustainability.... ...even though the accompanying statement states that this issue would have been discussed yesterday. They do show that the EC was offering to set VAT at hotels at 13%, not the top rate of 23% as had been proposed before.... It looks like the Commission is trying to lure Athens back to the table, or persuade the Greek people to push them there. Pierre Moscovici has just tweeted that the door is still open to consider the latest EC proposals, which they just released. And France\u2019s prime minister, Manual Valls, has said this afternoon that he believes Grexit must be avoided. In his second intervention of the day, Valls told i-Tele TV that it was important to respect Greece and democracy, and also European rules. \u201cSo Greece needs to come back to the negotiating table.\u201d The European Commission has just released the latest draft proposal which the two sides were working on until Friday night, when Greece shocked the eurozone by announcing a referendum. It has also claimed that creditors would have considered Greece\u2019s future financing needs, and debt sustainability, at Saturday\u2019s eurogroup meeting. Instead, of course, euro finance chiefs decided Greece\u2019s bailout should end on Tuesday night and then planned for the future without Athens at the table. The EC says: Discussions on this text were ongoing with the Greek authorities on Friday night in view of the Eurogroup of 27 June 2015. The understanding of all parties involved was that this Eurogroup meeting should achieve a comprehensive deal for Greece, one that would have included not just the measures to be jointly agreed, but would also have addressed future financing needs and the sustainability of the Greek debt. It also included support for a Commission-led package for a new start for jobs and growth in Greece, boosting recovery of and investment in the real economy, which was discussed and endorsed by the College of Commissioners on Wednesday 24 June 2015. And here\u2019s that draft proposal, which I guess is what the Greek people will be asked to vote on on Sunday -- expect it never became a formal offer. Marks &amp; Spencer has about 25 stores in Greece. This weekend, it declined to make any comment on what it might do should Greece\u2019s banks close. Rival retailer Dixons Carphone, which owns the Kotsovolos chain in Greece, has already said it could benefit from tough times in the country which might force some of its competitors out of action. In fact the company has already done rather well out of Greece\u2019s troubles. Kotsovolos, which has just under 100 stores making it the country\u2019s largest electrical goods retailer, returned to profit in the three months to 2 May as underlying sales rose by more than 8%. The chain benefited from a government scheme helping disadvantaged people with free tablets and laptops. Seb James, chief executive, told The Independent this month that Dixons Carphone has got detailed contingency plans in place if Greece does exit the euro. \u201cObviously we don\u2019t want to see civil unrest because that\u2019s not good for business, but we\u2019ve been there before and are well prepared. Professor Karl Whelan of University College Dublin just launched a blogpost which explains why he thinks some Greek banks won\u2019t open tomorrow. The ECB\u2019s decision to cap emergency liquidity at its current level means capital controls are now coming, he argues. That\u2019s because commercial bank reserves have probably been significantly depleted by the rush to some cash machines this weekend. So, they have little left in cash or reserves at the central bank, leaving them exposed when they open their doors on Monday morning. Professor Whelan explains: In that case, the only way the Greek banks could finance the (presumably very large) demands for withdrawals on Monday would have been to get access to additional funds from the Bank of Greece in the form of additional ELA. That will not be possible now, so most likely the banks will not open on Monday. The statement that \u201cECB will work closely with Bank of Greece to maintain financial stability\u201d is probably code for \u201cECB will help Greece to design a programme of capital controls\u201d. So it has come to this. No matter how well things go from here (and positive scenarios are hard to imagine) restrictions on Greek banks could be in place for a very long time. It is easy at this point to panic and say it\u2019s the end of the world and a new currency must be days away. It\u2019s worth remembering, however, the Cyprus coped surprisingly well with its capital controls and ultimately they were lifted this year and the banking system survived. There is probably still a small window of opportunity left to keep Greece in the euro, even if the banks don\u2019t open tomorrow. The Bank of Greece has denied that governor Yannis Stournaras has threatened to quit if capital controls aren\u2019t implemented, as has apparently been rumoured. A BoG official told Reuters that: \u201cWe categorically deny that Governor Stournaras threatened to resign.\u201d The latest word is that Greece\u2019s financial stability council will start meeting at 4pm BST, or 6pm local time, to discuss the situation. That meeting will be chaired by finance minister Varoufakis (who has already come out against capital controls this morning), and Bank of Greece governor Yannis Stournaras. Dow Jones Newswires reporter Stelios Bouras is taking the mood at the cash machines too: And here are photos of those lengthening ATM queues in Kifisia. Across the Greek capital, our Southern Europe John Hooper spies longer queues at the cash machines: Alarm is growing, even in affluent parts of Athens that were unaffected on Saturday. I am in well-heeled Kifisia, a northern suburb, and I just counted 78 people queuing at four ATMs. There is a more than slightly surreal atmosphere in central Athens today, reports my colleague Jon Henley. Sun shining, cafe and restaurant terraces full, whole families out for Sunday lunch \u2013 and elsewhere, in teleconferences and committee rooms, the nation\u2019s fate (or at least, its near-term economic and financial future) is being decided. Most Greeks I spoke to are confused. \u201cI have a lot of questions,\u201d said Yannis Georgousopoulos, an MBA student. \u201cDo the banks open tomorrow? What actually happens when the bailout ends, Tuesday? If the referendum\u2019s a yes, does the government go? If it\u2019s a No, will the institutions change their mind? It\u2019s just a real mess. Crazy.\u201d Marina, who works for a women\u2019s magazine, and her friend Jenny were anxious about getting at their money \u2013 they had finally found a functioning ATM \u2013 but more worried about what the coming week would do to Greece. \u201cWe\u2019ll tear ourselves apart,\u201d said Marina. \u201cIn fact it\u2019s already started happening. No one really knows what\u2019s going on, no one is really informed, but everyone\u2019s got opinions \u2013 strong opinions \u2026 That scares me.\u201d Neither had a clue what to expect (\u201cWay too many questions \u2013 nobody knows,\u201d said Marina), neither wanted Greece to exit the euro (\u201cNobody wants a Grexit,\u201d said Jenny) and both disagreed over how their government had handled the situation. \u201cTsipras has fought, he really fought,\u201d said Jenny. \u201cI hope he keeps fighting. We should get a better deal than this.\u201d Marina, though, was not so sure the prime minister would be able to \u2013 or even should.\u201cI don\u2019t believe he\u2019ll get a better deal, actually, whatever happens,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s pissed them off now, especially with the referendum. Maybe he should have taken what they offered.\u201d More reaction: We shouldn\u2019t underestimate the importance of this quote, from Greece\u2019s central bank governor: \u201cThe Bank of Greece, as a member of the Eurosystem, will take all measures necessary to ensure financial stability for Greek citizens in these difficult circumstances.\u201d All measures could potentially mean restrictions on bank withdrawals to get Greece through until next Sunday, and the referendum. Karl Whelan, professor of economics at University College Dublin, fears that Greek banks will struggle to open tomorrow: Other economists agree that the decision to cap emergency liquidity puts Greece\u2019s financial system under even more strain: The European Central Bank has not taken the nuclear option of crashing the Greek banking sector today (although, as covered this morning, it wasn\u2019t really on the cards) But by not providing any more emergency liquidity assistance, the ECB is putting huge pressure on the Greek banking sector, as top officials wonder how they will cope if many Greeks try to withdraw savings on Monday. ELA has been a lifeline that has been steadily raised this year, to make up for the outflow from banks. So by effectively capping it at \u20ac89bn, the ECB has ensured that Greece\u2019s emergency pot will run dry soon. That means Greek officials must now consider what measure they need to take to get the system through the week, until Sunday\u2019s referendum. And as flagged up earlier, Greece\u2019s Financial Stability Council (including Varoufakis and Stournaras) is meeting this afternoon. It\u2019s a classic move from the ECB, avoiding the political decision that Greece is definitely going to do bankrupt. It\u2019s official, the European Central Bank has decided to maintain the emergency liquidity support on offer to Greece, but it has also not provided any extra help. In a statement, the ECB says that it has decided to maintain the ELA ceiling at Friday\u2019s limit (that\u2019s \u20ac89bn). So it hasn\u2019t pulled the plug, but it also hasn\u2019t provided extra funding to cover the funds that have flowed out of Greek banks this weekend. For weeks, the ECB has been agreeing to requests from Greece for extra emergency liquidity, often providing a billions euros or more each week. So if there\u2019s no extra ELA, that is going to make it harder for banks to handle withdrawals, if people keep taking money out. Here\u2019s the full statement: The Governing Council of the European Central Bank today welcomed the commitment by ministers from euro area Member States to take all necessary measures to further improve the resilience of euro area economies and to stand ready to take decisive steps to strengthen Economic and Monetary Union. Following the decision by the Greek authorities to hold a referendum and the non-prolongation of the EU adjustment programme for Greece, the Governing Council declared it will work closely with the Bank of Greece to maintain financial stability. Given the current circumstances, the Governing Council decided to maintain the ceiling to the provision of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to Greek banks at the level decided on Friday (26 June 2015). The Governing Council stands ready to reconsider its decision. Mario Draghi, ECB President, said: \u201cWe continue to work closely with the Bank of Greece and we strongly endorse the commitment of Member States in pledging to take action to address the fragilities of euro area economies.\u201d Yannis Stournaras, Governor of the Bank of Greece, said: \u201cThe Bank of Greece, as a member of the Eurosystem, will take all measures necessary to ensure financial stability for Greek citizens in these difficult circumstances.\u201d The Governing Council is closely monitoring the situation in financial markets and the potential implications for the monetary policy stance and for the balance of risks to price stability in the euro area. The Governing Council is determined to use all the instruments available within its mandate. Varoufakis also insisted that Greece needn\u2019t be forced out of the eurozone. Indeed, there\u2019s no mechanism to exit the single currency. The euro was never designed to solve a problem such as Greek insolvency, and we\u2019ve had a comedy of errors since, he adds. So will you repay \u20ac1.6bn the IMF? Varoufakis replies that Greece is due \u20ac1.9bn in profits which the ECB made on its holdings of Greek banks. We owe money to one part of the troika, and we are owed money by another..... Those profits, though, are likely to vanish from the table if the bailout expires on 30 June (based on what the Eurogroup said yesterday). BBC Radio 4 have just broadcast their interview with the Greek finance minister (live here). Is it inevitable that restrictions will be imposed on how much money people can withdraw from banks? This is a matter that we will have to work overnight on, with the appropriate authorities in Greece and Frankfurt, says Varoufakis. Q: So will there be capital controls? Varoufakis replies: I, as minister of finance, with the Bank of Greece and European Central Bank, will work out what to be done to minimise the burden on our people from Europe\u2019s refusal to grant us our basic democratic right. So he\u2019s not announcing capital controls are certainly coming (as had been rumoured earlier). Varoufakis also argues that it would be a fundamental breach of European democracy if the ECB decides that Greece\u2019s banks shouldn\u2019t be allowed to keep functioning while its Greek people have their say. He\u2019s tweeted this point too: But what about the prospect of the ECB pulling emergency funding today? As a politician, and a European citizen, I find it appalling that we are having such discussions within a monetary union, Varoufakis replies. If it happens, it would mean that: That Europe has failed in its duty to preserve in parallel a democratic process and a monetary union. In a monetary union, a central bank should do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d, and in a democracy the people should be able to vote on momentous issues without seeing their banks shut. More to follow... My colleague Jon Henley reports from Athens: Things are starting to move fast. Reuters is reporting that Greece\u2019s Financial Stability Council is due to meet this afternoon to discuss the banking situation. That council includes of Yanis Varoufakis, his deputy Dimitris Mardas, Central Bank Governor Yiannis Stournaras, and also the head of the Greek Banks Association, the chairman of the HFSF bank bailout fund and the head of the Capital Markets Commission. Even before Tuesday when Greece\u2019s bailout programme expires, another deadline is coming towards Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government like an express train. The end of the month is fast approaching, and with it the payment of wages and pensions which should begin on Monday. That \u2013 and not the bailout expiry \u2013 could trigger the closure of the banks and the shutting down of their cash machines, the daily Ta Nea reported today. It said the government was hoping the central bank would transfer \u20ac1.5bn to keep people from leaving bank counters and ATMs empty-handed. But what no one knows is whether \u2013 with or without the support of the ECB -- the Bank of Greece has the money to transfer. If not, then the banks may well be shut tomorrow as they prepare for restrictions on depositor withdrawals. Even if the central bank can scrape together the funds for Monday\u2019s heavy withdrawals, without ECB support, the retail banks look certain to run out of cash once that wages and pensions have been paid. At that point, restrictions would become inevitable. Ta Nea said that adjusting the country\u2019s ATMs would take two to three days, during which the banks would need to remain closed. Heads-up: BBC Radio 4 is going to broadcast an interview with Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, sometime after 1pm BST (3pm Athens). In it, Greece\u2019s finance minister talks about the ECB\u2019s imminent decision on bank support, and the issue of capital controls. It should be broadcast live here. I believe it\u2019ll be uploaded here once it\u2019s been broadcast. Associated Press reports that some Greek cash machines have been busy again this morning, as we await the verdict of the ECB. Worried Greeks continued lining up at ATM machines Sunday morning, the day after the Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for a referendum on creditors\u2019 financial proposals in return for rescue loans. While some machines were running out of cash, others were being replenished. A couple of photos from Athens today: From Athens, John Hooper writes: The European Central Bank was facing one of the most momentous decisions of its brief history on Sunday as its board members considered whether to keep providing more of the emergency lending that has kept Greek banks open despite a steady run on deposits that accelerated dramatically at the weekend. An ECB spokesman declined to comment on reports that the board had already made up its mind to scrap the programme, known as Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA). But a source hinted that talks were already in progress on Sunday morning. Here\u2019s his full take: The European Central Bank has begun holding a conference call on whether to continue providing emergency liquidity to the Greek bank sector. There are various rumour swirling around, so let\u2019s be cautious. Reuters is reporting that the ECB is considering keeping ELA running, but demanding a higher \u2018haircut\u2019 on the assets that Greek banks hand over in return (reflecting the fact that those assets are now riskier). The bigger the haircut, the less liquidity is still available to Greek banks to keep running. It says: \u201cThere is a possibility of an extension,\u201d said one of the people with direct knowledge of the ongoing telephone discussion among the ECB\u2019s decision-making Governing Council, adding that a bigger \u2018haircut\u2019 is being discussed. This chart shows how Greek bank deposits have fallen steadily this year, to an 11-year low. And this chart shows how a higher haircut woulc cuts the amount of extra ELA funding available: In short, it\u2019s the ost Greece\u2019s president has been meeting with senior political leaders today to discuss the situation, following last night\u2019s referendum vote. Prokopis Pavlopoulos has just seen Antonis Samaras, head of the right-wing opposition New Democracy party. He\u2019s now expected to see Stavros Theodorakis, head of the centrist To Potami party. Both parties opposed the decision to hold a referendum, but were outvoted. Looks like there\u2019s been a translation glitch out of Austria, so have updated that earlier post: CORRECTED-AUSTRIA\u2019S FINANCE MINISTER SCHELLING SAYS GREECE WOULD HAVE TO ASK TO LEAVE EU, OTHER COUNTRIES WOULD HAVE TO AGREE (DID NOT SAY GREXIT APPEARS ALMOST INEVITABLE) Apologies for confusion: Here\u2019s the official line from Britain\u2019s government on the crisis this morning: A spokesperson for HM Treasury says: We urge the people of Greece to resolve the current uncertainty, and ensure economic and financial stability across Europe. \u201cWe have taken measures to increase our economic security so we can deal with risks like this from abroad, and we continue to take steps to prepare and protect ourselves from all eventualities\u201d. One senior executive at one of Greece\u2019s largest conglomerates says her firm has taken steps to cope with the possibility of capital controls being imposed. She told John Hooper, our Southern Europe editor, that: \u201cWe are ready for everything.... \u201cWe have foreign banks ready to support us and enough cash to deal with payments inside and outside Greece We have ensured that, for a long period ahead, we have everything we need.\u201d But smaller firms, she added, will be much more dependent on the Greek banks. Here\u2019s John\u2019s take: Austria\u2019s finance minister, Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling, has flagged up that Greece would have to leave the European Union in order to leave the eurozone. He told the Die Presse newspaper that: \u201cGreece would have to file a request to do so. The other EU countries would have to approve the request. Only then could Greece leave the eurozone.\u201d There simply isn\u2019t a clear way for a country to simply exit the single currency. Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, told my colleague Ian Traynor recently that any country leaving the euro must also leave the EU. The Foreign Office hasn\u2019t changed its advice on managing your finances when travelling to Greece. A spokeswoman tells us that the advice was \u201calways under review\u201d and the FCO website would be updated if necessary. At present, the current advice says: \u201cWhen travelling outside of the UK, you should take more than one means of payment with you (cash, debit card, credit card). Make sure you have enough money to cover emergencies and any unexpected delays.\u201d William Hill, the UK bookmaker, has refused to accept any more bets on Greece leaving the eurozone, after a flood of wagers on an early Grexit. Hill\u2019s spokesman Graham Sharpe says: \u2018The only option people want to back at the moment is that Grexit will happen this year and we can no longer hope to balance the market so we have decided to pull the plug\u2019 Greece is also the 1/3 favourite to be the first country to leave the European Union, followed by the UK at 4/1, and Hungary at 12/1. French PM Manuel Valls also urged Greece to return to the negotiation table and reach a deal: \u201cI cannot resign myself to Greece leaving the euro zone ... We must find a solution.\u201d France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, has dropped a clear hint that the European Central Bank should keep supporting Greece\u2019s banks: Speaking on Europe 1 radio, Valls said: \u201cThe European Central Bank is independent, but I don\u2019t doubt it will assume its responsibilities. I don\u2019t think it can cut off support, to put it another way.\u201d Technically, it takes a two-thirds majority at the ECB to reject a request for more emergency funding from a national central bank. Valls also warned Greek voters that a \u201cno\u201d vote in the upcoming referendum would effectively be a decision to leave the euro zone. \u201cThe Greek people must be able to decide lucidly. If there\u2019s a negative vote, there is a real risk ...of exiting the euro zone.\u201d The BBC is reporting this morning that the European Central Bank will vote to \u2018turn off\u2019 Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) for Greek banks at its meeting later today, but many experts are doubtful. Economics editor Robert Peston had blogged that the ECB will conclude that it can\u2019t continue extending credit to Greek banks, given the high risk of the Greek government defaulting. One \u2018well-placed source\u2019 told Peston: \u201cWe think the Greek government will have no choice but to announce a bank holiday on Monday, pending the introduction of capital controls.\u201d ECB to turn off emergency help for Greek banks We\u2019ll find out later today. However, there\u2019s a huge problem with the ECB pulling the plug -- Greece is technically still in a bailout programme for another three days. Crashing the banking sector now would be a deeply political decision, with the referendum coming up. It\u2019s more likely that the ECB would vote to cap the existing ELA, at its current level of \u20ac89bn. That would still leave Greek banks exposed if funds continued to be withdrawn. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek debt crisis. The eurozone is entering the most perilous period since the creation of the single currency 16 years ago, after yesterday\u2019s dramatic scenes in Brussels and Athens. And today could be just as gripping, Greece is on the brink of default this morning, after eurozone finance ministers yesterday refused to extend its bailout to allow a referendum to be held. And in the early hours of this morning, Greek MPs voted to press on and hold the poll anyway, a week today: The path to that vote looks perilous though. Without the extension, Greece will exit its bailout at the end of Tuesday night, and presumably unable to repay the \u20ac1.6bn it owes the IMF on the same day. The other eurozone finance ministers have already been drawing up measures to protect themselves, as our Europe editor Ian Traynor wrote last night: Europe\u2019s single currency entered the stage of rupture for the first time in its 16-year life on Saturday night when 18 governments told Greece its bailout package would be terminated within days. The country plunged towards financial collapse after its leftwing prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, abandoned negotiations and called a referendum on his lenders\u2019 terms for continuing the lifeline. An emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers took place in Brussels on Saturday evening without Greece for the first time since the crisis began in 2010. It turned into a crisis planning session devoted to quarantining Greece and insulating the rest of the eurozone from the impact of anticipated financial mayhem... EU ministers refuse bailout extension for Greece as referendum looms Attention now turns to the European Central Bank, which must now decide today whether to continue providing the emergency liquidity needed by the Greek banking sector to keep running. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

This is what happens in the US or the UK, for example, with higher taxes in areas that are doing well being redistributed to areas with slower growth and higher unemployment.</p> <p data-dropid=\"4\">The euro, however, was constructed along different lines. Countries were allowed to join even though it was clear they would struggle to compete with the better performing nations such as Germany. A stability and growth pact designed to ensure a common set of budget controls was a poor substitute for fiscal union. From the start, it was obvious that the only mechanism for a country that ran into severe difficulties would be harsh austerity. Greece is the result of what happens when politics is allowed to override economics.</p> <p data-dropid=\"5\">If Greece leaves, the idea that the euro is irrevocable is broken. Any government that runs into difficulties in the future will have the Greek option of devaluation as an alternative to endless austerity. Just as importantly, the financial markets will know that, and will pile pressure on countries that look vulnerable. That\u2019s why Greece represents an existential crisis for the eurozone.</p> <p data-dropid=\"6\">It will be said in response that Greece is a small, insignificant country and that the single currency has much better defences than it had at the last moment of acute trouble in the summer of 2012. Diplomats in Europe\u2019s capitals took very much the same view in late June 1914.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/28/greece-crisis-eurozone-sarajevo-moment\">Greece crisis could be a Sarajevo moment for the eurozone</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5590644fe4b024248ae9a5bd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-28T21:17:56.248Z\">10.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The euro is continuing to be pummelled in early trading in Asia -- it has now shed almost two cents against the US dollar</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/statuses/615267500134113280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"et\" dir=\"ltr\">EURUSD just jutted lower. <a href=\"http://t.co/9NmjqDdueV\">pic.twitter.com/9NmjqDdueV</a></p>&mdash; Joseph Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/615267500134113280\">June 28, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-559063dee4b024248ae9a5b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-28T21:16:11.308Z\">10.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sky\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway sums it up:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/statuses/615264850521010176\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Banks shut, capital controls, limits on withdrawals, shut stock markets.

It\u2019s worth remembering, however, the Cyprus coped surprisingly well with its capital controls and ultimately they were lifted this year and the banking system survived. There is probably still a small window of opportunity left to keep Greece in the euro, even if the banks don\u2019t open tomorrow.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WhelanKarl/statuses/615151332593377280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A short post on the ECB decision. &quot;ECB Decision Likely Means Greek Banks Stay Closed.&quot;

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Banks and other financial companies want the new Conservative government to cut the cost of complying with a swath of new regulation, according to a survey by the Confederation of British Industry. When the employers\u2019 lobby group asked firms what the government should do to help the financial industry support economic growth, reducing regulatory costs was the top priority, particularly for banks. Banks said they expected to spend more money complying with rules in coming months and that new laws and regulations were potential brakes on business expansion. Companies also called for more stability in the tax system \u2013 a priority that came a close second to lower regulatory costs among banks. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s director of economics, said: \u201cThe cost of regulation and tax uncertainty are a top concern for firms across the sector. They want to see the government focus on keeping the UK a competitive financial centre by not putting UK firms at a disadvantage.\u201d The CBI published its survey little more than a week before the chancellor, George Osborne\u2019s budget on 8 July. It is his first budget in a Conservative government, rather than a coalition. As the City recovers from the financial crisis, companies are lobbying for an end to criticism of the banking industry and an easing of rules designed to prevent another crisis. They argue the sector is a big employer and that the City\u2019s position as a financial centre is important for the UK\u2019s economy. The City is lobbying hard in the hope that, after the Tories\u2019 surprise election victory, Osborne will use the budget to take greater note of their arguments. Barclays and other banks have urged the government to review the ringfence required by 2019 to separate retail and investment banking. Banks also object to the introduction of criminal liability for senior executives whose reckless behaviour causes their company to fail. The CBI survey showed life insurers, forced to implement new capital rules, also put less regulation at the top of their list of priorities. The call for greater tax certainty reflects banks\u2019 unhappiness at the bank levy, which Osborne increased in his March budget \u2013 before the general election \u2013 and has declared a permanent fixture of the UK tax system. The British Bankers\u2019 Association has written to Osborne asking him to review tax measures affecting the sector. HSBC has taken the lead for the banks by threatening to leave the UK if it decides the cost of remaining is too great. Britain\u2019s biggest bank listed ringfencing and the levy, which HSBC says affects it disproportionately, as important considerations. Banks, investment banks and other companies also blamed regulation partly for falling productivity among their workforces. Increased spending on \u201cnon-productive activities\u201d such as regulatory compliance was the top reason given for weaker output per employee. The quarterly survey, compiled with the accountants PwC, showed business activity and confidence increasing in the financial sector though banks\u2019 confidence did not rise. Profitability in the three months to June rose at its fastest pace since March 2011. Kevin Burrowes, UK financial services leader at PwC, said: \u201cLevels of optimism among banks remain broadly unchanged this quarter, which is a little surprising as we had expected to see a bounce from the election result and the greater encouragement for financial services from the new government. However, ongoing regulatory uncertainty, the EU referendum and other macro-economic factors have dampened the outlook at least in the short term. Not all bankers have opposed the government\u2019s measures. Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s chief executive, Antonio Horta Oso\u0301rio, told bankers earlier this month to stop complaining about the ringfence and other regulatory measures. Sir John Vickers, whose commission proposed the banking ringfence, will give evidence to the House of Lords economic affairs committee on Tuesday. Jonathan Symonds, chairman of HSBC\u2019s UK bank, will also appear to discuss the ringfence alongside Lloyds finance director, George Culmer.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A hundred and one years ago on Sunday, gun shots rang out in a city in southern Europe. Few at the time paid much heed to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife as they drove through the streets of Sarajevo. Within six weeks, however, Europe was at war. Make no mistake, the decision by Alexis Tsipras to hold a referendum on the bailout terms being demanded of his country has the potential to be a Sarajevo moment. The crisis is not just about whether there is soon to be a bank run in Greece, although there is certainly the threat of one. It is not just about whether the creditors overplayed their hand in the negotiations, although they did. It is about the future of the euro itself. There will be much talk in the next few days about how Greece can be quarantined. The three people who have been leading the negotiations for the troika - Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund, Jean-Claude Juncker of the European commission and Mario Draghi of the European Central Bank - can still cling to the hope that Tsipras will lose the referendum next Sunday. In those circumstances, the Syriza-led coalition would have little choice but to hold an election. The return of a government headed by, for example, the centre-right New Democracy, would open up the possibility that Athens would sue for peace on the terms demanded by the troika. There is, however, no guarantee of this. The troika was certain last week that Tsipras would fold when presented with a final take-it-or-leave-it offer. They were wrong. The Fund, the ECB and the European commission made a fatal misjudgement and have now lost control of events. The immediate decision for the ECB was whether to cut off emergency funding before the country\u2019s bailout programme formally ends on Tuesday. Wisely, it has chosen not to make matters worse. In recent weeks, the Greek banks have only been able to stay open because Draghi has provided funds to compensate for capital flight. Sunday night\u2019s announcement of an emergency bank holiday and capital controls demonstrates just how critical the situation has become. Germany strongly supports the immediate end to emergency liquidity assistance (ELA), arguing that taxpayers in the rest of Europe should not be further exposed to the risk of a Greek exit from the single currency. The ECB, however, has always been reluctant to take what would clearly be a political decision to escalate the pressure on the Greek banks, and has announced that it will continue providing funding at last week\u2019s level. Even so, Greece now faces a week of turmoil. Tsipras bowed what seemed to be inevitable on Sunday by announcing controls to try to prevent Northern Rock-style queues outside the banks and - just as importantly - money leaving the country. The Greek government will also be making contingency plans for exit from the single currency. Tsipras and Yannis Varoufakis, his finance minister, say that is not their wish or intention, but if the result of the referendum backs the government\u2019s stance it is hard to see any alternative. Cyprus stayed in the euro after introducing capital controls, but it was done with the approval of other single currency members and involved knuckling down under an austerity programme. In the meantime, the blame game has begun. The creditors say they offered Greece a deal that would have secured future financing in return for reforms and budget savings which would have hastened the country\u2019s economic recovery. Lagarde has said there is now nothing on the table and that Greece should not expect the same terms to be available after the referendum. Tsipras said the troika was proposing an \u201cextortionate ultimatum\u201d of \u201cstrict and humiliating austerity without end\u201d. A spokesman for Varoufakis said the referendum meant the end to five years of \u201cwaterboarding\u201d. The stance taken by the troika has been wrong-headed but inevitable. Greece has seen its economy shrink by 25% in the past five years. A quarter of its population is unemployed. It has suffered a slump of Great Depression proportions, yet the troika has been demanding fresh tax increases that will suck demand from the economy, stifle growth and add to Greece\u2019s debt burden. If Greece were outside the euro, IMF advice would be different. The fund would be telling Greece to devalue its currency. It would be telling the country\u2019s creditors that they would have to take a \u201chaircut\u201d in order to make Greece\u2019s debts sustainable. It would then justify domestic austerity on the grounds that the benefits of the devaluation should not be frittered away in higher inflation. This option, though, has not been made available to Greece. It is unable to devalue and European governments are resistant to the idea of a debt write-down. So the only way Greece can make itself more competitive is to cut costs, by reducing wages and pensions. A fully fledged monetary union has the means to transfer resources from one region to another. This is what happens in the US or the UK, for example, with higher taxes in areas that are doing well being redistributed to areas with slower growth and higher unemployment. The euro, however, was constructed along different lines. Countries were allowed to join even though it was clear they would struggle to compete with the better performing nations such as Germany. A stability and growth pact designed to ensure a common set of budget controls was a poor substitute for fiscal union. From the start, it was obvious that the only mechanism for a country that ran into severe difficulties would be harsh austerity. Greece is the result of what happens when politics is allowed to override economics. If Greece leaves, the idea that the euro is irrevocable is broken. Any government that runs into difficulties in the future will have the Greek option of devaluation as an alternative to endless austerity. Just as importantly, the financial markets will know that, and will pile pressure on countries that look vulnerable. That\u2019s why Greece represents an existential crisis for the eurozone. It will be said in response that Greece is a small, insignificant country and that the single currency has much better defences than it had at the last moment of acute trouble in the summer of 2012. Diplomats in Europe\u2019s capitals took very much the same view in late June 1914.",

      "bodyText": "Greek banks will not open on Monday, the head of one of the country\u2019s biggest banks said on Sunday. Anthimos Thomopoulos, the boss of Piraeus Bank, said that the banks would not open on Monday after leaving a meeting of the Greek financial stability council. He made his remarks amid speculation that public holidays looked inevitable in Greece this week after the European Central Bank declined to increase its emergency financial lifeline to the Greek banks, cash that is keeping the country\u2019s financial system functioning. With Greece holding a controversial referendum on its creditors\u2019 terms for its bailout in less than a week and the eurozone deciding to terminate the bailout on Tuesday, the pressure was on Mario Draghi, the president of the ECB, to make the call as to whether Greece would sink or swim. In a finely calibrated decision, the governing council of the ECB decided on Sunday to leave the so-called emergency liquidity assistance to Greece at \u20ac89bn (\u00a363bn), unchanged from last Friday. \u201cWe continue to work closely with the Bank of Greece,\u201d said Draghi. Yannis Stournaras, the governor of the Bank of Greece and a member of the ECB council, said: \u201cThe Bank of Greece, as a member of the Eurosystem, will take all measures necessary to ensure financial stability for Greek citizens in these difficult circumstances.\u201d The decision to maintain life support supplied a little oxygen to a Greece in the throes of suffocation.

If the experiment has been a disaster for Greece, it is also a colossal failure for Europe, with the result that at the very apex of leadership the EU nowadays resembles an unhappy assembly of squabbling politicians locked in what could not be called an \u201cever closer union\u201d. Take just the last few days. On Thursday leaders at a summit contemplated formally for the first time, however briefly, the prospect of Britain leaving the EU. By three o\u2019clock on Friday morning they were all at one another\u2019s throats in an unseemly quarrel over who should take part in accommodating a mere 40,000 refugees from Italy and Greece over two years, and on what terms. On Saturday, 18 governments of the eurozone cut Greece off and initiated a process that could end in pushing Athens out of the currency and perhaps out of the union. Three days, three crises, and a collective performance that inspires little hope or confidence in their crisis management. The air is already thick with recrimination, not just between Greece and the rest of Europe, but among the Europeans. France says that Greece must be saved, Germany says impossible. The European commission is seeking to revive negotiation that are on their deathbed. The Finnish finance minister, Alex Stubb, is looking forward to the funeral. The International Monetary Fund is at odds with the Europeans over the levels of Greek debt. Everywhere there is the sight of leaders seeking to escape responsibility for a sorry state of affairs. For weeks, in anticipation of the criticism certain to be directed at them in the event of a Greek collapse, senior German figures have privately been saying: \u201cWell, nobody will be able to say that we did not try our best.\u201d At the meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Saturday that ended the Greek bailout, the French finance minister, Michel Sapin, was the only one with enough humility to remark that maybe the Europeans had got some things wrong and that things might have been done differently, according to witnesses. The IMF has argued internally for at least three years that the organisation was breaching its own rules by taking part in a bailout that held out little prospect of achieving the debt sustainability the fund\u2019s rescues prescribe. Christine Lagarde, the IMF chief, ignored the advice of her own experts and remained in the failing project. Following the calling of the Greek referendum, the collapse of the negotiations and the end of the bailout on Saturday, the European commission, keen to salvage the situation while diverting blame, stated publicly for the first time on Sunday that the proposed deal would have included a form of debt relief for Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s central demand. \u201cThe understanding of all parties involved was that [Saturday\u2019s] Eurogroup meeting should achieve a comprehensive deal for Greece, one that would have included not just the measures to be jointly agreed, but would also have addressed future financing needs and the sustainability of the Greek debt,\u201d a commission statement said. Berlin will not wear that any time soon. According to people present, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, told his eurozone counterparts there was no way he would risk taking a Greece bailout proposal to the Bundestag at this stage, especially when Tsipras had roundly rejected it. \u201cWe would have to say to our population and parliament that [the Greek] government would do what it is obliged to do in the programme, although it just recommended that people should not accept it,\u201d he then told German TV. Eurozone leaders ooze confidence that Greece\u2019s financial collapse could be easily weathered by the rest of the currency bloc. No one really knows how the chaos, likely if Tsipras wins his referendum on Sunday, will affect the rest of the zone economically and financially. But it is political poison. For Europe\u2019s leaders, five years of failure in Greece mean that everyone\u2019s a loser.",

    "webTitle": "Interest rates and growth warning from Bank for International Settlements", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The international body that represents the world\u2019s central banks has issued a stark warning that an unprecedented period of ultra-low interest rates mask deep weaknesses in the global economy and threaten to be the trigger for the next financial crisis. In its annual report, the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements says that what used to be considered \u201cunthinkable\u201d risks becoming the \u201cnew normal\u201d, with clear risks for future stability. BIS said the need for abnormally low level of interest rates to be kept in place six years after the trough of the global financial crisis in early 2009 reflected a broader malaise. It added that monetary policy \u2013 the willingness of central banks to print money and keep borrowing costs low \u2013 was bearing too much of the burden and that governments needed to rely more on structural reform to secure sustainable growth. BIS was the one global body to point out in advance of the financial crash of 2007 that booming asset prices could cause problems even during periods of low inflation, and its latest warning will be seen as a call for its central bank members to start returning monetary policy to more normal settings. \u201cGlobally, interest rates have been extraordinarily low for an exceptionally long time, in nominal and inflation-adjusted terms, against any benchmark\u201d, the report said. \u201cSuch low rates are the most remarkable symptom of a broader malaise in the global economy: the economic expansion is unbalanced, debt burdens and financial risks are still too high, productivity growth too low, and the room for manoeuvre in macroeconomic policy too limited. The unthinkable risks becoming routine and being perceived as the new normal.\u201d The US Federal Reserve is likely to be the first central bank in any major advanced country to raise interest rates. Wall Street expects the Fed to tighten policy later this year, with the Bank of England forecast to follow in 2016. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are currently still using quantitative easing \u2013 the creation of electronic money \u2013 to boost activity. BIS noted that it was proving \u201cexceedingly difficult\u201d to understand the malaise affecting the global economy, but said the problem stemmed from a failure to come to grips with financial booms and busts that left deep and lasting scars. \u201cIn the long term, this runs the risk of entrenching instability and chronic weakness. There is both a domestic and an international dimension to all this. Domestic policy regimes have been too narrowly concerned with stabilising short-term output and inflation and have lost sight of slower-moving but more costly financial booms and busts. \u201cAnd the international monetary and financial system has spread easy monetary and financial conditions in the core economies to other economies through exchange rate and capital flow pressures, furthering the build-up of financial vulnerabilities. Short-term gain risks being bought at the cost of long-term pain.\u201d BIS added that far from being the solution, persistently low interest rates risked becoming the problem. \u201cRather than just reflecting the current weakness, low rates may in part have contributed to it by fuelling costly financial booms and busts. The result is too much debt, too little growth and excessively low interest rates. In short, low rates beget lower rates.\u201d As evidence of its thesis, BIS said that between December 2014 and the end of May 2015, on average around $2tn (\u00a31.27tn) in global long-term sovereign debt, much of it issued by euro area sovereign states, was trading at negative yields. At their trough, interest rates on French, German and Swiss bonds were negative out to a respective five, nine and 15 years, with the result that investors were paying for the privilege of holding government debt. \u201cSuch yields are unprecedented\u201d, BIS said. \u201cYet, exceptional as this situation may be, many expect it to continue. There is something deeply troubling when the unthinkable threatens to become routine.\u201d",

The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are currently still using quantitative easing \u2013 the creation of electronic money \u2013 to boost activity.</p> <p>BIS noted that it was proving \u201cexceedingly difficult\u201d to understand the malaise affecting the global economy, but said the problem stemmed from a failure to come to grips with financial booms and busts that left deep and lasting scars.</p> <p>\u201cIn the long term, this runs the risk of entrenching instability and chronic weakness. There is both a domestic and an international dimension to all this. Domestic policy regimes have been too narrowly concerned with stabilising short-term output and inflation and have lost sight of slower-moving but more costly financial booms and busts.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the international monetary and financial system has spread easy monetary and financial conditions in the core economies to other economies through exchange rate and capital flow pressures, furthering the build-up of financial vulnerabilities. Short-term gain risks being bought at the cost of long-term pain.\u201d</p> <p>BIS added that far from being the solution, persistently low interest rates risked becoming the problem. \u201cRather than just reflecting the current weakness, low rates may in part have contributed to it by fuelling costly financial booms and busts. The result is too much debt, too little growth and excessively low interest rates. In short, low rates beget lower rates.\u201d</p> <p>As evidence of its thesis, BIS said that between December 2014 and the end of May 2015, on average around $2tn (\u00a31.27tn) in global long-term sovereign debt, much of it issued by euro area sovereign states, was trading at negative yields.</p> <p>At their trough, interest rates on French, German and Swiss bonds were negative out to a respective five, nine and 15 years, with the result that investors were paying for the privilege of holding government debt.</p> <p>\u201cSuch yields are unprecedented\u201d, BIS said. \u201cYet, exceptional as this situation may be, many expect it to continue. There is something deeply troubling when the unthinkable threatens to become routine.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The home secretary has been asked to conduct an urgent review of how a whistleblower\u2019s allegations of corruption at Compass Group are being investigated, after anti-corruption campaigners claimed UK prosecutors only became interested in the case after prompting by the FBI. The move comes after the Guardian revealed a series of allegations made against the FTSE 100 catering conglomerate, based on a cache of private documents relating to an ongoing employment tribunal claim. The claimant is Karim Pabani, a former finance director of a Compass subsidiary in Kazakhstan who claims he was sacked after blowing the whistle on corruption. In a letter to the home secretary, Theresa May, the policy director of Corruption Watch, Susan Hawley, and the chief executive of the whistleblower charity Public Concern at Work, Cathy James, wrote: \u201cAt a time that the Prime Minister is seeking international leadership on corruption, the UK can ill afford to be seen to be slow on the uptake with corruption allegations or indeed less proactive than its international partners in responding to whistleblowers.\u201d The Guardian revealed the contents of documents relating to the Pabani case last week, which showed how a Compass subsidiary paid bribes to Kazakh customs officials through \u201cfreight forwarders\u201d, a practice the group says it eradicated as soon as it was discovered in 2011. The papers also show how Compass uncovered a suspected fraud at its joint venture with a state-owned oil company, where a supplier linked to an employee pocketed \u00a3160,000 after overcharging the joint venture. Compass says it has been a victim of fraud in this case. The joint venture was run at the time by Timur Kurenbekov, the son of a senior Kazakh government official and thought to have been the key to the joint venture winning major contracts in Kazakhstan. Pabani also alleged in his tribunal witness statement that Kurenbekov had been \u201cremoving money from the business through the use of their suppliers\u201d. Compass has yet to respond in detail to Pabani\u2019s employment tribunal claims. A spokesman said: \u201cCompass is vigorously defending these allegations [in the tribunal] but as the matter is subject to ongoing legal proceedings we are not able to comment further at this time.\u201d The Corruption Watch and Public Concern at Work letter alleges that UK prosecutors were slow to act on the initial allegations, with British authorities taking \u201cthree months to do what the US authorities did in two weeks\u201d. It says the case was incorrectly assigned to the City of London\u2019s overseas anti-corruption unit (OACU) instead of the Serious Fraud Office, which has wider investigatory powers, and that the unit\u2019s handling of the material \u201cappears to have been seriously inadequate\u201d with it taking \u201cover a year to interview a key witness\u201d. Pabani contacted the FBI in April 2014 and was interviewed at a meeting on 1 May 2014 at the US embassy in London by \u201ca representative from the FBI\u2019s International Corruption Unit and a Department of Justice attorney,\u201d the letter states. After alerting the SFO to the allegations three times, twice via its confidential reporting line and a third time directly, Pabani was \u201ccontacted by OACU in June 2014,\u201d the letter states. A spokesman for the OACU said: \u201cThe City of London police overseas anti-corruption unit has received an allegation of foreign corruption made by a former employee of a UK-based company. They are currently in the ongoing process of assessing material provided and other information with a view to establishing whether the matter should be adopted for investigation\u201d. An SFO spokesperson said: \u201cThe City of London police is currently in the process of assessing material provided as well as other information with a view to establishing whether the matter should be adopted for investigation. \u201cWith all such matters we work collaboratively with the City of London police. If there are allegations of corruption which meet the SFO\u2019s criteria, then these are taken forward by the SFO\u201d. The FBI declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "Ancient Greeks originally theorised that the elegant shape of honeycomb, with its interlocking hexagons, was an example of nature\u2019s efficiency. In the back garden of his home outside Wigan, Barry Jackson has taken similar inspiration to create an alternative form of housing. The 52-year-old builder had been considering how to create a \u201cman cave\u201d on his property for his drum kit and photography equipment, when he thought of constructing a series of six-sided rooms which could be built and attached together in a honeycomb design. The result, some three years later, is the Hivehaus, hexagonal rooms each of 100 square feet attached together to form a personalised building. It can be erected in four to five days by three builders, has no foundations, and can be used as a study, garden room, gym and possibly even transportable housing. Describing the design as \u201canti-builder and anti-architect\u201d, Jackson said the identical structures use standard off-the-shelf materials. A three-unit Hivehaus costs about \u00a355,000, offering an alternative way to get people on to the property ladder. \u201cA lot of young people won\u2019t ever have that chance that I had. They are still living with their parents in their 30s. It delays having families because people don\u2019t feel that they belong anywhere, because they are stuck in some rental trap. \u201cThe more I developed this idea, the more I saw that this could be developed for good and hopefully help people who can\u2019t get on the housing ladder,\u201d he said. Jackson spent \u00a320,000 building the showhouse that emerged from his idea in the back garden of the home he shares with his wife, daughter and various dogs and chickens. Each sideof the hexagonal rooms is two metres in length and can be made up of various combinations of panel or glass with internal doors sliding into the walls. Steel supports hold the roof - which has a dome to let in light. Each room can support two glass sides. The wooden frame floor sits on feet that adjustable to compensate for uneven ground. Electrical wiring runs through the floor and lights are remote-controlled so there are no switches in the walls. As well as the hexagonal spaces, Jackson has also developed smaller diamond shaped rooms with bathroom fittings. Decking in similar structured patterns can be used to make an outside area. \u201cHow it is constructed is not how we have always had to \u2013 filling the ground full of concrete, bricks and mortar. I tried to take this back to the simplest form,\u201d he said. In theory, two or three units could be bought by a young couple who could then add to them over time as their financial circumstances improve, he said. \u201cThe house grows with your circumstances. It suits your circumstances. \u201cWith this idea, every module is the same size and you think of the module as a space which you use for whatever \u2013 if you need another bedroom, you add another module.\u201d Jackson is looking for a large builder to supply and build the units. They are made offsite and delivered as flatpacks. There are suggestions they could be used as homes for elderly relatives, young couples planning to buy land and live in them, and large companies using them as holiday rental units. People could rent out their main house while living in a Hivehausl. One film post-production house has asked whether they could be put on a roof in central London and used as edit suites. Problems could arise, however, for those seeking mortgages. A bank is unlikely to lend on a house that could theoretically be taken apart and moved in a few days, Jackson said. He has set himself the challenge of changing the way in which people view housing. \u201cWe are very much set in our ways, especially the British mindset, in how our home is our castle \u2026 we want to get on that housing market and own something,\u201d he said. \u201cHousing should not be the way that it is now. It is a necessity I believe so everybody should be able to afford housing and be able to budget for housing.\u201d The Scandinavian-style buildings will not be for everyone. \u201cThis really is a lifestyle choice because it is a lot more minimal, a lot simpler and \u2018I have not got all that money going out all the time, I can now do the hobbies that I want to do, I can travel\u2019,\u201d he said. Where could you build? If the Hivehaus is used as a garden room, studio or office, it can be built without planning permission. If it is to be lived in, however, permission is required, Jackson said. He has heard a number of suggestions for uses, including one man who wanted to build 20 modules meandering through his Cheshire woodland with sections for each of his children. Jackson also has plans for two-storey versions of the same concept. \u2022 You can read our archive of The innovators columns here or on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

      "bodyText": "It was a gift for opponents of the planned HS2 fast rail link connecting London with the Midlands and the north. A suppressed government report showed that the Department for Transport thought the \u00a350bn project was unaffordable given other spending commitments. This embarrassing finding was sneaked out on the day that the government shunted into the sidings promised upgrades of rail lines in the Midlands and the north. Inevitably, the conclusion drawn was that the delays to the electrification of the London-to-Sheffield and Manchester-to-Leeds lines are the unacceptable price being paid for the mounting cost of HS2, a worthy successor to Concorde in the long list of great British white elephants. In truth, there is no link between Network Rail\u2019s failure to deliver on its five-year investment plan and the billions being budgeted for HS2 over the next couple of decades. Not yet, at least. But the cost overruns and the missed targets that have led to the transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin \u201cpausing\u201d the electrification upgrades provide little optimism that HS2 will be brought in on its current budget, or anything like it. And, eventually, that would have an impact on transport spending elsewhere. Yet, before HS2 is written off as a extravagance Britain can\u2019t afford, it is worth putting the case for a new high-speed rail line. The argument is not about cutting half an hour off journey times for business men and women, since they all work on the train anyway. It is not about modernising the nation\u2019s rail network, although, given the UK\u2019s lowly ranking of 27th in the World Economic Forum\u2019s league table for the quality of infrastructure, there is plenty of room for improvement. Opponents of HS2 are not opposed to spending more on the railways: they simply think that the money could be spent better elsewhere, on smaller and less glamorous projects. It is not even about the way in which the northern regions of England have received disproportionately low levels of transport investment, both in comparison with London and regions in other European countries. No, the real argument in favour of HS2 is that it could transform the economies of the Midlands and the north, acting as the catalyst for faster growth in the way that a hundred piecemeal projects could not. This is what might be called the \u201cbuild it, they will come\u201d approach, named after the film Field of Dreams, in which Kevin Costner builds a baseball stadium in the US midwest because he is convinced the crowds will turn up. They duly arrive. But that\u2019s just Hollywood. Is there any evidence that \u201cbuild it, they will come\u201d works in the real world? Perhaps surprisingly, there is. A recent study of Berlin during the period 1880-1914 that saw the building of its public transit system found a \u201cmutually dependent relationship between local economic performances on the one hand and transportation supply on the other\u201d. Put a different way, it wasn\u2019t simply the growth of Berlin that led to the development of its public transport system. It was the investment in the public transport system that led to the growth of Berlin. There are more modern examples of the same phenomenon. Canary Wharf, in what used to be London\u2019s docklands, is one. The development around the Guardian\u2019s offices in King\u2019s Cross, London, is another. A big-bang approach with large-scale investment can lead to rejuvenation and rapid growth. The economic performance of cities matters. They have higher productivity and lower per-capita carbon dioxide emissions than non-city areas, which means the imperative is to to make cities denser and more easily accessible from surrounding areas. A report by the consultancy Volterra* found that infrastructure projects can be game changers for both regions and the entire country, but only if there is a re-jigging of the way schemes are evaluated. \u201cThe UK\u2019s current appraisal and funding system is based on the assumption that transport investments are made to generate welfare improvements for passengers, rather than to change the economy\u2019s output potential. Where change is only incremental it may well be reasonable to consider the economy as being independent of transport in this way. However, where there is the potential for structural economic change, accompanied by major spatial change locally and regionally, this is unlikely to provide a sufficiently full view of likely future transport requirements. \u201cThe changes experienced at Canary Wharf show that past trends are not a useful guide to the future in all circumstances.\u201d Britain has rarely, if ever, approached infrastructure in this way. There has been no assessment of what is actually needed, no overall vision, no guaranteed long-term funding. Instead, money has been thrown at individual projects for political reasons, capital spending has borne the brunt of cuts to public spending, management has been poor. The five-year delay in making a decision about airport capacity is an example of economic decisions being coloured by political cowardice; the railways a tribute to the make-do-and-mend approach; the intermittent stretches of dual carriageways on major (non-motorway) roads the result of money running out. The inadequacies of the transport system are a big part of the UK\u2019s productivity problem. Fair enough, opponents of HS2 might say, but that still falls short of a compelling reason for spending \u00a350bn (and the rest) on a railway line, especially since the opportunity cost, upgrades and new investment that won\u2019t happen, is potentially high. That\u2019s a reasonable point. The argument for HS2 is that it could provide the catalyst for growth in the Midlands and the north. To that extent, George Osborne is justified in talking about the need for a northern powerhouse. But it will only work on certain conditions. First, control over transport has to be de-centralised in the way that it is in other countries. It is no accident that the two regions of the UK that have the most local control over transport \u2013 London and Scotland \u2013 have the highest spending per head. Second, the management of projects has to be improved \u2013 something that a more localised approach should help deliver. Third, HS2 should be built from the north southwards rather than from London northwards. That would both maximise the benefits to the northern regions and bring them forward in time. Fourth, any overruns on HS2 should not result in raids on the rest of the transport infrastructure budget. Those who see HS2 as just another vanity project will say this is pie in the sky and that the chances of transforming the northern regions lie somewhere between slim and nil. This looks unduly pessimistic. In the right circumstances \u201cbuild it, they will come\u201d could work. But if HS2 is to be scrapped, it should be scrapped now rather than when billions of pounds have been spent on it. *Investing in City regions: Volterra",

Unconfined joy will spread from the south-east northwards, and west to the Cornish constituencies captured by the Tories from the Liberal Democrats. The optimistic forecasts do not stop there. Unemployment will continue to fall, productivity will rise, and the Bank of England, concerned that the UK\u2019s runaway success is about to generate the return of inflation, will start to put up interest rates at a gentle pace. It is this rosy view of the future that underpins the Treasury\u2019s drive to cut tax credits in the upcoming upcoming emergency budget. George Osborne appears to believe that his plan to reduce state top-up payments for people in work will soon be forgotten in a booming economy. Cuts to tax credits could make up \u00a35bn of the \u00a312bn of extra reductions in the welfare bill earmarked by Osborne to help him on his way to a budget surplus in 2019. That\u2019s a hefty whack to households on modest incomes striving to better themselves. One scenario illustrates the point. Today, a two-parent family with an income of \u00a326,000 who spend \u00a3140 a week on childcare for two young children should receive tax credits each year of \u00a32,233. Now let\u2019s say the second earner in this case study doubles their weekly hours from 10 to 20, so earning, say, \u00a37,200 rather than \u00a33,600, and pushing the household income to almost \u00a330,000. Along with that, the government\u2019s tax credit top-up currently more than doubles to \u00a35,052. It\u2019s the reward for working longer hours; and it could disappear in the current review. Plenty of backbench Tory MPs ask why the state should boost the living standards of families at this income level when they may live in an area where their outgoings are low and their disposable income relatively high. High levels of fraud and errors in calculating tax credits have also discredited the system. Last year, HMRC was reported to be pursuing more than 4.7m cases of overpaid tax credits, amounting to debts of \u00a31.6bn. But these same backbenchers are wary of moving against a key group of voters ahead of the promised economic miracle. And they should be. All the data tells us that middle income families are spending only a proportion of their gains from lower petrol prices, cheaper food and a 2% average wage rise. They are clearly nervous, and their reluctance to splash the cash is borne out by the heavy discounting seen on the high street in the summer sales. If these households are told that they can expect to lose a sizeable chunk of their tax credits, their nervousness will only intensify. The sums under discussion are considerable. Our fictional family begins to lose tax credits once their joint annual income passes the \u00a330,000 mark. Once the joint income exceeds \u00a340,000, it has almost all gone. The election was won in marginal seats across the east and west Midlands, where families opted for the Tories over Labour in significant numbers. These families are not going to forgive a government that rewards their votes with a financial kick. Nevertheless, it looks like Osborne is going to take the risk. He knows the plan is a gamble that will fail if employers refuse to raise wages above 2% while inflation creeps upwards. That will only double the pain of tax credit losses, hitting consumer spending and the economy more broadly. Add in the prospect of the Bank of England ratcheting up base rates and hiking their mortgage bill, and families might see the withdrawal of government support as a betrayal. Now Network Rail has lost its credit, Heathrow won\u2019t be happy When Network Rail was reclassified as a public body last year, the government and the industry were keen to play down the significance \u2013 this was not really renationalisation. But having the railway\u2019s debt on the Treasury\u2019s balance sheet started to change everything. Before that, the infrastructure owner would not have been too concerned about the mounting costs of work it had promised to carry out; it would simply have borrowed more. Yet now that the railway\u2019s infamous credit card has been snipped up by the Treasury \u2013 having run up \u00a338bn and rising of rail debt \u2013 promises of jam tomorrow look very hollow. For Network Rail, and the wider industry, this is grim: the capital it has enjoyed in recent years, financial and political, has been blown. But the ministers who now have to poop the party are the very same as have stoked the festivities in recent years, trumpeting the goodies they were going to deliver. Even as children\u2019s centres closed and bedrooms were taxed, spending on rail infrastructure somehow was preserved, apparently from a separate, miraculously self-refilling, pot. After this crisis, as the new railways promised to the north and Midlands fail to materialise, rail\u2019s tortuous financing can only come under greater scrutiny. Rail\u2019s fall from grace, and the demand that it live within its means, could have come at an unfortunate moment for another transport interest. The airports commission is preparing to recommend where to put a new runway this week. While both Heathrow and Gatwick, if chosen, will raise the billions in private money needed to expand, a bigger Heathrow would also need public funds spent on the roads and surrounding infrastructure. That\u2019s another \u00a36bn, according to the commission \u2013 and according to Transport for London estimates, perhaps double that. As the Department for Transport picks over the bones of Network Rail\u2019s five-year plan this summer, it will surely blanch at the idea of demanding billions more for Heathrow. What don\u2019t bankers understand about being ethical? Just what has been the point of the $150bn worth of fines that have been slapped on the world\u2019s biggest banks since the onset of the crisis? It a question worth posing after Mark Carney\u2019s remarks on Friday. The governor of the Bank of England said: \u201cA lot of people in these markets didn\u2019t really know \u2013 and probably still do not know \u2013 what is expected of them because it hasn\u2019t been adequately defined in everyday language.\u201d It seems unlikely that the hundreds of pages of traders\u2019 chat released by the regulators has not provided a clear example of inappropriate behaviour. Making an example of the offers of champagne and curries to fix interest rates should have been enough of an explanation: after all, the offers themselves could hardly have been expressed in plainer language. The real problem is that so many bankers appear to have got off scot-free. What is required is more work to ensure that individuals are held accountable for their actions.",

      "bodyText": "There is decency left in public life after all! In the course of an evening at the Mansion House in which he announced some bizarre budgetary targets, George Osborne found the time to pay a warm tribute to his long-time antagonist, former shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Not only that: there was spontaneous applause in honour of the man who, but for the unexpected result of the election, would have been standing in Osborne\u2019s place, unveiling a somewhat more appealing economic strategy. As my dear friend the late Alan Watkins used to say: \u201cPolitics is a rough old trade.\u201d But I have noticed since the election that the dignitaries of the City of London are not alone in expressing, alas somewhat belatedly, their admiration for Mr Balls. Indeed, it is a truth now widely acknowledged that the nation in general, and the present government in particular, owe a lot to Balls. He was the most important influence in keeping Britain out of the eurozone, and the driving force behind making the Bank of England independent. Moreover, with the man who originally hired him in 1992, one Gordon Brown, Balls played a major role in establishing the reputation for \u201cprudence\u201d which enabled the Labour party under the duumvirate of Tony Blair and Brown to increase investment in public services. It all ended in tears with the financial crash \u2013 which, it cannot be repeated often enough, was not caused by the public spending of which Cameron and Osborne approved at the time, but by a banking \u201csystem\u201d that had spun completely out of control. We now find Labour suffering its own great depression, amid endless soul-searching and, on the part of at least one candidate for the leadership, a series of statements which make one wonder why they don\u2019t just own up and join the Conservatives. I say \u201csoul-searching\u201d advisedly, for, whatever else the party does in the face of defeat, it must not lose its soul. And, for all the maliciously \u201chelpful\u201d suggestions it is receiving from certain commentators, this does not necessitate a great lurch to the right. Labour has always been the party of the oppressed. In the early days, and for decades after, so many people could be categorised as underdogs that Labour\u2019s \u201cnatural constituency\u201d was enormous. That has changed; I have a distinct memory of some Labour figure once saying that, if society evolved in the way the party\u2019s founders hoped, they might end up with a majority feeling comfortable enough to vote Conservative. To coin a phrase, socialism, not capitalism, might contain the seeds of its own destruction. Thus it was interesting to read in a Times article that when party adviser Stewart Wood was asked by Gordon Brown why he had joined the party, he replied: \u201cTo help the bottom 25%.\u201d To which Brown responded: \u201cYes, but we mustn\u2019t say that or we will never win.\u201d There lies the explanation for all the \u201cprudence\u201d and clandestine attempts at redistribution \u2013 although, given the tendency of globalised capitalism to widen the gap between rich and poor, it was often a case of preventing the gap becoming worse rather than actually narrowing it. But it is Osborne\u2019s declared purpose to indulge in another bout of cuts, not just to \u201cwelfare\u201d but in the public services generally. Interestingly, in a fundamentally laudatory article about David Cameron last week, his former tutor, Professor Vernon Bogdanor, warns that Cameron\u2019s \u201cbig society\u201d faces two problems. \u201cThe first is whether it offers sufficient succour to the victims of Conservative policies directed towards a smaller state and retrenchment in public spending \u2026 The second and deeper problem with the \u2018big society\u2019 is that it conflicts with the economic liberalism to which Conservatives are also committed.\u201d Now, there has been much media coverage about the \u00a312bn of welfare cuts in the offing; rather less of the \u00a38bn of tax cuts the Tories promised during the campaign. Beneath all this \u201cone nation\u201d soft soap there is a basic strategy: take benefits away from the needy and cut direct tax rates further. It did not surprise me when Nigel Lawson re-entered the fray last week with a call for a cut in the top rate of income tax from 45% to 40%. It was he who reduced the top rate from 60% to 40% in the 1988 budget. Once again he tells us it would cost virtually nothing. I seem to recall similar claims in 1988, when the small print of the budget report put the cost at \u00a38bn. It was all part of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s, and Lawson\u2019s, mission to liberalise the economy, and was supposed to be the solution to the UK\u2019s economic problems. So it is with excellent timing that Cambridge economists Ken Coutts and Graham Gudgin have produced a volume of research \u2013 The Macroeconomic Impact of Liberal Economic Policies in the UK \u2013 which finds that, for all the earlier problems with unions and high taxation, the most important economic indicators, including growth in GDP per head, were no better in the post-1979 decades than before. I end with a wonderful example of the perverse impact of \u201cthe cuts\u201d. There is a village in the home counties where council cuts have meant that a bush in front of a speed camera has not been, well, \u201ccut\u201d, and the camera cannot take photographs. Not trimming the hedgerows saves money; not being able to collect speeding fines does the reverse.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, over to Reuters for a snap summary: Greek lawmakers on Sunday authorised prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 proposed 5 July bailout referendum, setting Greece on course for a plebiscite that has enraged international creditors and increased Greece\u2019s chances of exiting the eurozone. The government easily passed the 151-vote threshold needed to authorise the referendum, with deputies from the far-right Golden Dawn voting with the government and pro-European opposition parties New Democracy, Pasok and To Potami and the KKE Communist party voting against. Greeks are due to vote on whether to accept or reject the latest terms offered by creditors to Athens in order to unlock billions of euros in bailout funds. European partners have reacted negatively to the announcement of the referendum. On Saturday, they rejected a request by Tsipras to extend the current bailout in order to cover the period leading up to the referendum. The rejection means Athens is likely to default on a key payment to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday. So, what a day. Thanks for sticking with us. I\u2019d better shut down now. Back in the morning. If you\u2019re not already sated, check out Ian\u2019s latest report. Goodnight! GW. Some instant reaction to tonight\u2019s vote: undefined The details of the vote are being checked, but it looks like a substantial majority in favour of referendum. That\u2019s because the extremist Golden Dawn lined up with MPs from the left-wing Syriza coalition, and the populist right-wingers of ANEL. A majority of Greek MPs have voted in favour of holding a referendum on its bailout terms on Sunday, 5th July. Even though, as covered through the day, that bailout it set to expires in three day\u2019s time. I think the government has got to its majority now. And so does Reuters: GREEK PARLIAMENT VOTES TO AUTHORIZE JULY 5 REFERENDUM ON BAILOUT TERMS - RTRS The chamber\u2019s thinning out now, as more MPs give their verdict and depart. Nearly there... The government is starting to open up a lead. Some 91 MPs have voted yes, while 70 have voted no. First to 151 wins. The far-right Golden Dawn are voting for a referendum. That suggests that the government should get a comfortable majority, as Syriza and ANEL have 161 seats out of 300 anyway..... MPs from the communist KKE party are voting against holding the referendum. Reminder, you can watch the voting here. That was indeed Yanis Varoufakis we spied earlier: The vote takes place by roll call, so each MPs name is read out, and they reply \u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03bf\u03c7\u03b9 (yes or no :) ). Just 300 names to get through..... OK, that spat is out of the way, and it\u2019s vote time (followed swiftly by bed time). I think we\u2019ll get a five minute recess first -- time to dig out those pyjamas or pour another mug or glass of whatever\u2019s keeping you going. Here\u2019s the problem: There\u2019s a vigorous exchange of views underway between communist MPs, Tsipras, and temporary speaker Mitropoulos - who is now laying down the law. Starting to worry that the bailout will expire before we get round to tonight\u2019s vote..... Syriza\u2019s MPs are on their feet and applauding hard as Tsipras ends his address. Now, and not before time, it\u2019s the vote - although a procedural issue is being raised by the Communist KKE party first. Tsipras is back on familiar ground as his speech comes to a climax: Voting No in a week\u2019s time would actually be a positive message for the future, says the PM. He\u2019s also vowing to abide by the result, even if the public choose Yes. Not much clarity about exactly what a No vote would lead to.... We don\u2019t want to break away with Europe, Tsipras pledges, just the policies which are counter to Europe\u2019s traditional values..... Syriza MPs are applauding, as their leader takes New Democracy to task: Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, is tweeting the key points from Alexis Tsipras\u2019s speech: Tsipras is now criticising creditors, for insisting on further cuts to pension spending, hitting the poorest, and refusing to allow the minimum wage to rise. He also tries to build bridges with EC president Jean-Claude Juncker; not so much with the IMF though. This is a defiant speech from Tsipras; no sign of a backward step following today\u2019s sensational development in Brussels, where finance ministers decided Greece\u2019s bailout must end on Tuesday. Yesterday our creditors blackmailed us with the threat of depriving liquidity, says Tsipras, today they use the fear of a bank run. He speaks of a propaganda of fear - but argues that the referendum could shake it off. Tsipras says Europe shouldn\u2019t fear referendums - many countries have held them before, including to implement treaties such as Maastricht. Tsipras gets an early round of applause by telling MPs he won\u2019t ask permission from Eurogroup president Dijsselbloem to hold a referendum. Nor Germany\u2019s finance minister, either. Alexis Tsipras begins by telling MPs that today is a historic day, when a democratically elected government\u2019s ability to decide its future was blocked by the eurogroup. Antonis Samaras appears to be attempting to mobilise a public backlash to the referendum plan. Anyway, he\u2019s finished now, and here comes the PM Samaras is now describing the referendum as a \u2018coup\u2019 attempt -- to get Greece out of the eurozone against the public will. Once Samaras finishes his speech, then we\u2019ll finally hear from Alexis Tsipras. Then MPs can vote, so we\u2019ll know if Greece will press on with a referendum in just over a week\u2019s time. I think I spotted Yanis Varoufakis arriving in the chamber a few minutes ago, which means the Greek finance minister should be able to vote for the referendum. New Democracy opposes a referendum, adds Samaras, but if it happens they\u2019ll campaign for a Yes vote - to preserve Greece\u2019s place in Europe. Samaras is accusing Tsipras of engineering a Grexit: Antonis Samaras is finishing his speech - telling MPs that the government has left Greeks very fearful: (reminder: our correspondents did report that some cash machines were very busy, but others rather quieter) Now they\u2019ve stopped for another recess! That\u2019s so another MP (Dimitris Mitropoulos, I think) can chair the end of the session. Speaker Konstantopoulou appears to have sent herself off, to restore harmony, after breaching a parliamentary rule by taking her seat during Samara\u2019s speech. MPs are taking their seats again.... Zoe Konstantopoulou is back in the Speaker\u2019s Chair too, and telling MPs that it\u2019s important to maintain parliament\u2019s image, with the world watching. I fear that particular ship sailed mid-way through the finger-pointing row that ended with New Democracy exiting stage left. Ah...Tsipras has asked for, and got, a short recess -- so that New Democracy MPs who left the chamber following Samaras\u2019s speech (in a row with speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou) can take their seats again: And here\u2019s a picture of that walkout: And finally, Alexis Tsipras is speaking in the Athens parliament - just 24 hours after announcing his referendum plan. Former prime minister Antonis Samaras is now speaking in parliament, and telling MPs that Tsipras has failed to win the better deal for Greece that he promised. There\u2019s an awful lot of barracking and shouting from the floor too -- it\u2019s more like the Punch and Judy of Westminster\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s Questions than the more respectful debate we often see in the Bundestag. Greece\u2019s minister of state, Nikos Pappas had earlier rejected criticism of the referendum - arguing it would help avoid the \u2018catastrophe\u2019 of further austerity: undefined Greece\u2019s parliament is still debating whether to hold a referendum on Sunday 5th July, and there\u2019s no sign that a vote is imminent. Fofi Gennimata, the new leader of the opposition left-wing Pasok party, is currently speaking [livefeed]- she\u2019s called on Tsipras to drop the referendum and hold snap elections instead. If you\u2019re just catching up with today\u2019s events, here\u2019s Ian Traynor\u2019s news story on the situation tonight: Europe\u2019s single currency entered the stage of rupture for the first time in its 16-year life on Saturday night when 18 governments told Greece its bailout package would be terminated within days. The country plunged towards financial collapse after its leftwing prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, abandoned negotiations and called a referendum on his lenders\u2019 terms for continuing the lifeline. An emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers took place in Brussels on Saturday evening without Greece for the first time since the crisis began in 2010. It turned into a crisis planning session devoted to quarantining Greece and insulating the rest of the eurozone from the impact of anticipated financial mayhem. The weekend events threw Europe into weeks of confusion and turbulence as 10 days of intense last-ditch attempts to salvage an agreement between Greece and its creditors collapsed. Tsipras accused the country\u2019s creditors of a vengeful act of humiliation against Greece and urged voters to follow him in rejecting the terms imposing more austerity in return for cash in the plebiscite on 5 July. The finance ministers refused to extend Greece\u2019s bailout beyond Tuesday, hastening the likelihood of Greece\u2019s ejection from the euro. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, refused to endorse the collective statement and left the meeting. Tsipras\u2019s gamble, following an EU summit in Brussels on Friday, leaves Europe\u2019s leaders, notably Angela Merkel of Germany and Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, with a stark dilemma \u2013 whether to let Greece sink or swim... More here: Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, has the inside line on today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting: I didn\u2019t spell it out earlier, but the reference to Greece taking \u2018measures to ensure financial stability\u2019 is a pretty clear hint that capital controls will be needed: Chart of the day (which doesn\u2019t include the fact Greece dropped back into recession early this year) Must stress that we\u2019ve not heard of any reports of thefts at cash machines today - so that last post was purely precautionary. Greek readers, please stay safe tonight: A protest in support of the Greek government has taken place in Madrid tonight, attended by (among others) the leader of Podemos, Spain\u2019s anti-austerity party. Here\u2019s the Slovak finance minister\u2019s take: Michael Noonan added that we won\u2019t know until late Sunday, or perhaps Monday morning, whether the ECB will extend more emergency liquidity to the Greek banks. They have other options, he adds. \u201cMonday could be a bank holiday\u201d. (you can see the whole interview here) Finance ministers are popping up all over the Commission, now the eurogroup meeting has broken up. Here\u2019s Ireland\u2019s Michael Noonan, telling reporters that the Greek referendum scuppered chances of an agreement today: The European Council has now issued the official statement following this evening\u2019s meeting of the other 18 finance ministers. Ministerial statement on 27 June 2015 It warns that Athens must take measures to ensure financial stability, once its bailout ends: We stress that the expiry of the EFSF financial arrangement with Greece, without immediate prospects of a follow-up arrangement, will require measures by the Greek authorities, with the technical assistance of the institutions, to safeguard the stability of the Greek financial system. The Eurogroup will monitor very closely the economic and financial situation in Greece and the Eurogroup stands ready to reconvene to take appropriate decisions where needed, in the interest of Greece as euro area member. Today\u2019s decisions don\u2019t mean Greece is leaving the eurozone, Sch\u00e4uble says. Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Schauble has been giving his own press conference -- and claimed that Greece is likely to get into a \u201cdifficult situation\u201d in the days ahead. Reuters has snapped the key points: GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS THE GREEK REFUSAL TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS SURPRISED EVERYBODY GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS THE REFERENDUM ANNOUNCED AT SHORT NOTICED WON\u2019T SOLVE PROBLEMS GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS IT IS PROBABLE THAT GREECE WILL GET INTO DIFFICULT SITUATION IN COMING DAYS GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS \u201cWE WILL DO EVERYTHING TO FIGHT ANY POSSIBLE CONTAGION\u201d GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS GREECE REMAINS PART OF EURO ZONE AND PART OF EUROPE, WILL DO EVERYTHING WHAT CAN BE DONE TO HELP GREECE IN DIFFICULT SITUATION The decision to break off talks last night and call a referendum was untimely, so why should we allow more time, Dijsselbloem asks. Things might be easier if the Greeks had called a referendum earlier, or had recommended that the people support the measures He then adds that the Athens parliament still has to take \u201ca wise position, and I hope that may lead to a different political situation.\u201d Did you exclude the Greek delegation from today\u2019s Eurogroup? Mr Varoufakis left the meeting before it ended, on his own account, says Dijsselbloem. Are you planning to call another eurogroup meetings? We will monitor events, and reconvene if necessary, Dijsselbloem adds. Is there a risk of contagion now? Dijsselbloem says that the former programme countries (those who have been through a bailout) are in much better shape. And the eurozone institutions are ready to take any action needed. Onto questions: Will Dijsselbloem respond to Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s suggestion that the Greek government will campaign for a \u201cyes\u201d vote in the referendum, if the institutions make new proposals? Dijsselbloem replies that it was Greece that broke off talks last night, not the creditors. The door is open to more talks with Greece. He then adds that \u201cthe process hasn\u2019t ended, it will never end, probably...\u201d Speaking a little hesitantly, Dijsselbloem says that the 18 eurozone finance ministers discussed \u201cour strong determination to ensure the strength of our monetary union\u201d. And we will use all the instruments at our disposal to ensure financial stability, alongside the ECB. The eurogroup still consists of 19 members , he states firmly. And we stand ready to support Greece if and when required, after the programme expires. Later than advertised, here comes the final act after a historic day in Brussels -- a press conference from Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the eurogroup. Here\u2019s the live stream. Looks like Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble will also give a briefing, which should be streamed here. EC vice-president Vladis Dombrovskis has also surfaced from the Eurogroup meeting: Back in Greece...energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis has just told Mega News that whatever changes (if any?) are made by creditors in the days ahead they won\u2019t change the \u201cessence of the proposal\u201d, which is unacceptable. He said: \u201cWe went into the euro to improve our lives, not to accept constant blackmail. Syriza\u2019s choice was not to leave the euro zone but to defend the interests of the people. If there is no agreement there are other roads that Greece has at its disposal.\u201d Lafazanis heads the far left faction in prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 Syriza party. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici, the former French finance minister, has denied that Greece is exiting the eurozone: EU\u2019S MOSCOVICI SAYS ON LEAVING THE MEETING OF EURO ZONE FINANCE MINISTERS THAT EURO ZONE WILL INCLUDE 19 COUNTRIES The Dijsselbloem press conference appears to be running late, sorry. France appears to have been Greece\u2019s only ally in the Eurogroup today: The killer line in DSK\u2019s take on Greece is that creditors are failing to learn lessons and \u201cseem to be repeating the mistakes\u201d. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who ran the IMF when the first Greek bailout was arranged, has published a \u2018mea culpa\u2019 about the mistakes the Fund made: He\u2019s admitted that it should have pushed other eurozone countries to do more to help Greece and fought against the push for tough austerity, admitting that it also miscalculated the impact of such \u201cpro-cyclical adjustment\u201d. And while it\u2019s too late to change that, DSK does make a case for giving Greece debt relief now - by rolling over and extending repayments due to official creditors. Michel Sapin is going out of his way to argue that a deal between Greece and its creditors can yet be revived. More is coming in about the telephone conversation the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras had this afternoon with the German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Francois Hollande. Helena Smith our correspondent writes: Courtesy of Mega News we are now learning that Tsipras\u2019 chat with both leaders was far from cordial. The Greek prime minister, responding to Merkel\u2019s protestations that the referendum would ultimately boil down to a choice \u201cbetween the euro and drachma\u201d is reported to have said: \u201cNo it isn\u2019t. This is the birthplace of democracy. We are a sovereign country and will not be told what question to pose in this referendum. The referendum wiill take place regardless of whatever the decision the Eurogroup takes.\u201d The TV channel has also reported this evening that some \u20ac400m euro have been withdrawn from ATMs since Tsipras announced the vote. Dozens of MPs have been seen lining up at ATMs in the parliament building today. Meanwhile, France\u2019s Michel Sapin is insisting, adamantly, that a deal can be salvaged. Here\u2019s your 15 minute warning -- eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem will hold a closing press conference at 8pm Brussels time (9pm Athens, 7pm UK). Hopefully we\u2019ll learn what measures the eurozone will take to preserve financial stability given the dramatic escalation of the Greek crisis: The remaining 18 finance minister have just ended their meeting -- Michel Sapin of France is giving a briefing now (livefeed here). He is telling reporters that France is ready to restart talks at any time with Greece. Nobody, least of all France, wants Grexit. We talked about issues of bank solvency this afternoon, Sapin says, but not Grexit. And he criticises the decision to call a referendum - it creates problems, particularly for Greece itself. A quick recap of the last few few hours. Greece is on the brink of exiting its bailout programme and defaulting on the International Monetary Fund next Tuesday. At what must have been an exceptionally tense meeting in Brussels, fellow finance ministers rejected Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s request to provide time for the Greek government to hold a referendum on Sunday, July 5. Instead, the remaining 18 members issued a statement saying the bailout will expire in five days time. They are now holding a second meeting - without Athens at the table - to prepare for the consequences, as Europe\u2019s long-running financial crisis enters a new and dangerous phase. Greece\u2019s shock decision to call a referendum on the proposals from its creditors has clearly stunned many finance ministers. Arriving at the meeting, eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem called it a negative surprise: And speaking afterwards, Dijsselbloem spoke of the risk that Greece faces once its bailout ends: \u201cIt is the responsibility of the Greek government to meet its obligations, firstly with the IMF,...It is a responsibility and it doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d Yanis Varoufakis called it \u201cA bad day for Europe\u201d as he left the Commission. He also criticised the eurogroup for failing to accept that Athens had to put the creditors\u2019 proposal to its people, saying he feared it would suffer permanent damage to its credibility as a democratic institution. And Varoufakis even floated the prospect of the Greek government reversing its position and backing the plan in next Sunday\u2019s referendum - if creditors offered better terms. The ECB, whose emergency funds have helped Greek banks keep running as savers withdrew funds this year, says it is monitoring the situation closely. And there are reports that bank withdrawals have continued through the day: Greek MPs are still debating whether to hold a referendum, with a vote expected at midnight Athens time (10pm BST). Helena Smith, our Athens correspondent, has more details of Tsipras\u2019s call to Merkel and Hollande today. Tsipras apparently told both leaders: \u201cDemocracy is of the highest order in Greece and the referendum will take place regardless of the Euro group decision.\u201d Some instant reaction to this afternoon\u2019s drama: GC = governing council. PFO = Please File Outside (only less polite) Greek MPs are continuing to debate whether to hold a referendum next Sunday on the offer from its creditors - even though that offer is on track to expire on Tuesday night. A Greek government insider has told local media that Alexis Tsipras has spoken by phone to Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande. Apparently he told them that the Greek people will survive, whatever the Eurogroup decides: The European Central Bank has just tweeted that it will \u2018hold a meeting in due course\u2019 to discuss Greece. Not a surprise that they\u2019re \u2018closely monitoring\u2019 events, given the ECB has provided \u20ac89bn of emergency liquidity to keep Greece\u2019s banks running. Not forgetting its own exposure to Greece. Here\u2019s the full statement from the eurogroup (excluding Greece): Since the 20 February 2015 agreement of the Eurogroup on the extension of the current financial assistance arrangement, intensive negotiations have taken place between the institutions and the Greek authorities to achieve a successful conclusion of the review. Given the prolonged deadlock in negotiations and the urgency of the situation, institutions have put forward a comprehensive proposal on policy conditionality, making use of the given flexibility within the current arrangement. Regrettably, despite efforts at all levels and full support of the Eurogroup, this proposal has been rejected by the Greek authorities who broke off the programme negotiations late on the 26 June unilaterally. The Eurogroup recalls the significant financial transfers and support provided to Greece over the last years. The Eurogroup has been open until the very last moment to further support the Greek people through a continued growth-oriented programme. The Eurogroup takes note of the decision of the Greek government to put forward a proposal to call for a referendum, which is expected to take place on Sunday July 5, which is after the expiration of the programme period. The current financial assistance arrangement with Greece will expire on 30 June 2015, as well as all agreements related to the current Greek programme including the transfer by euro area Member States of SMP and ANFA equivalent profits. The euro area authorities stand ready to do whatever is necessary to ensure financial stability of the euro area. [END] Greece\u2019s finance minister then headed to the exit door of the commission. As he left, one reporter asked \u201cIs this a sad day for you?\u201d Yanis Varoufakis replied instantly: It\u2019s a sad day for Europe, but we will overcome it. And with that, Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s Eurogroup press conference ends. Will there ever be another one? Finally, Varoufakis confirms that he spoke with the head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, but gives no more details. Varoufakis says that the eurogroup made a \u2018comprehensive\u2019 proposals two days ago, and that\u2019s what we will put to the Greek people. And we are leaving the door open for that proposal to be improved -- no ambiguity there. We were asked whether to say yes, or no, and as democrats we are asking the people what we should. And on the issue of Grexit, Varoufakis insists:: Anyone who says that this referendum is about the euro is putting a very shaky interpretation on a clear fact - there are no provisions for exit from the monetary union. Greece\u2019s finance minister denies that the July 5 referendum would eb about eurozone membership: VAROUFAKIS -THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS FOR A COUNTRY TO LEAVE EURO VAROUFAKIS -REFERENDUM IS NOT ABOUT EURO Varoufakis claims that a deal can still be reached by Tuesday -- adding that the Greek government could even support it if creditors offered better terms. The Greek finance minister says he would abide by the will of the people in next Sunday\u2019s vote: Yanis Varoufakis is now giving a press conference in Brussels. He is telling reporters that Greece couldn\u2019t accept the recessionary consequences of the proposals from its lenders. Nor did we have the mandate to reject them - only the Greek people could decide. And he criticises Greece\u2019s creditors for trying to drag Greece back to its old bailout terms rather than allowing it to breath and return to growth. He claims that there is still time to improve the proposals - and that Greece would work \u2018night and day\u2019 to achieve this. And Varoufakis ends by attacking his fellow finance ministers: The refusal of the eurogroup today to endorse our request for an extension of this agreement for a few days, a couple of weeks, to allow the Greek people to vote on their proposals - even when there is a very high probability that Greeks will go against our recommendation and vote yes - will certainly damage the credibility of the eurogroup as a democratic union of partner member state. I\u2019m very much afraid that damage will be permanent. Reuters has snapped the key points: GREEK FINMIN VAROUFAKIS SAYS I EXPLAINED TO EURO ZONE COLLEAGUES WHY WE COULD NOT ACCEPT PROPOSALS GREEK FINMIN VAROUFAKIS SAYS BAILOUT TERMS WERE RECESSIONARY, FINANCING TERMS DID NOT ADD UP, NO ELEMENTS TO SUGGEST PLAN COULD END CRISIS GREEK FINMIN VAROUFAKIS SAYS I EXPLAINED WE DID NOT HAVE MANDATE TO SIGN UP TO NON-VIABLE PROPOSALS, BUT NO MANDATE TO REJECT THE PROPOSALS WITHOUT CONSULTING THE PEOPLE GREEK FINMIN VAROUFAKIS SAYS WE ARE ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED TO FIND SOLUTION GREEK FINMIN VAROUFAKIS SAYS GREEK PEOPLE WILL BE ASKED WHETHER THEY ACCEPT PROPOSALS, THERE IS ROOM TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATING NIGHT AND DAY TO IMPROVE LENDERS\u2019 PROPOSALS VAROUFAKIS - REFUSAL OF EUROGROUP TO ENDORSE REQUEST TO EXTEND BAILOUT FOR FEW WEEKS WILL DAMAGE EUROGROUP CREDIBILITY, DAMAGE MAY BE PERMANENT A final question about the consequences if the Greek people were to vote Yes vote in the referendum (ie, to accept the creditors offer) Dijsselbloem: Much to our regret, the Greek authorities have rejected what was on the table even though it wasn\u2019t finished. In the meantime there are already major risks for the Greek government handle. And if they vote yes, the question is \u2018who are we working with to implement the programme?\u201d Will Greece be in the room when you reconvene in a few minutes? And did you discuss the implications of Greece defaulting on its 6.7bn euro payment to the ECB on July 20? Dijsselbloem declines to speculate, but confirms that Greece won\u2019t be in the room when the other ministers discuss what steps to protect themselves. The Greek government must meet its obligations to its creditors, says Dijsselbloem. That responsibility doesn\u2019t go away. Can emergency liquidity still be provided to the Greek banks once the programme has expired? Only the ECB governing council can answer that question, says Dijsselbloem. If the programme expires on 30 June, what are the Greek people going to vote on? You should ask the Greek government, says Dijsselbloem. I cannot answer it. Is there anything the Greek people can do to stay in the eurozone? Right now, a referendum on this problem, with a \u2018negative advice\u2019 is in the Athens parliament, Dijsselbloem replies. Greek MPs need to understand that the package wasn\u2019t completed - there is no comprehensive package from the eurogroup - and need to understand the risks that are ahead in the coming weeks. I regret those risks, but they are there. The Greek parliament needs to consider where we are in the process, if they\u2019ve been properly informed about the programme, and what is ahead. Only then can they take a \u2018wise decision\u2019. There are no easy programmes - if the Greek government can\u2019t take that message to their people they have a credibility problem, Dijsselbloem concludes. It is not clear how the Greek government will survive without funding, Dijsselbloem adds. Onto questions: What would a yes vote mean? Many ministers asked our Greek colleague that, Dijsselbloem replies. And he said that if the people voted yes, then he and the government would immediately implement it. But there is a \u201cgreat\u201d problem of credibility. We have found that such programmes only work if the government supports the measure being implemented. Dijsselbloem says that talks were still continuing between Greece and the creditors last night, when the Greek delegation suddenly had to leave the room. The other 18 members of the eurogroup regret the fact that Greece has rejected these last proposals from the institutions, he continues. The proposals on the table had already offered the \u201cmaximum\u201d flexibility possible, he continues. But the proposals weren\u2019t concluded, they weren\u2019t finished, but yet the Greek government has rejected them and put them to the Greek people. Given that situation, however regrettable, the Greek programme will expire on Tuesday night. And we\u2019re off. Dijsselbloem says that a statement is being issued shortly, from 18 ministers. Not supported by Greece. We will immediately have a second meeting after this press conference, to discuss consequences and to prepare for whatever is needed to preserve the stability of the eurozone. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup, has been spotted heading to the press room, and he doesn\u2019t look very happy: The press room is starting to fill up.... reminder, there\u2019s a live stream here. Serious levels of confusion in Brussels right now -- sounds like all 19 finance ministers are back in the room, but the Greek side might yet depart early. And apparently there might be a press conference with Jeroen Dijsselbloem soon after all. Reuters reporting that Eurogroup ministers are planning to meet without Greece shortly. 27-Jun-2015 16:10:53 - EUROGROUP MEETING WITH GREECE RESUMES, WILL BREAK AGAIN BEFORE MEETING OF 18 FINMINS WITHOUT GREECE -EURO ZONE OFFICIALS There\u2019s confusion in Brussels as to whether we\u2019re going to get a press conference now, or now. Brussels reporters have heard that Greece\u2019s delegation is leaving today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, following the rejection of its request for an extension: AFP says Greece\u2019s request for an extension has been turned down: Stefan Leifert of ZDF, the German TV station, reports that Yanis Varoufakis is speaking to the European Central Bank team during this pause in negotiations, while Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is with the IMF\u2019s Christine Lagarde. EbS, the Brussels TV channel, has just started transmitting from the press conference room. It\u2019s virtually empty right now, but that might mean something is about to happen. The latest word from Brussels is that Greece will not be granted the one-month extension which it is seeking: And that would mean that the current bailout would expire on Tuesday, 30 June. A reminder that you can watch the Greek debate here. If you tune in now, you can see Andreas Loverdos of the left-wing Pasok party heavily criticising the decision to hold a referendum: AFP reporter Roland Jackson has tweeted a picture of one Athens cash machine that ran dry, although he quickly found another that was working: Here\u2019s a similar tale from the Greek capital: The machine in the Athens parliament still appears to be running, though: Saturday seemed business as usual in central Athens, my colleague Jon Henley writes. Shoppers are out in force, and a steady stream of people taking cash out of many ATMs but \u2013 except for National Bank branches, where pensions deposited last night were being withdrawn today \u2013 nothing you could reasonably call a long queue. Customers were, though, understandably starting to get a bit fed up with all the attention. At a Eurobank branch ATM on Syntagma Square there was a furious row between two photographers and four or five people waiting to take out money. \u201cI wasn\u2019t taking out my savings, actually: I still think this will work out okay eventually,\u201d said Iannis Kairis, a web developer. \u201cBut if I was, I wouldn\u2019t want my photograph taken. It\u2019s normal.\u201d Shoppers on nearby Ermou, one of central Athens\u2019 main shopping streets, seemed mostly relaxed \u2013 if unsure about what next week might hold. \u201cI don\u2019t have any money in the bank \u2013 I didn\u2019t have much to start with, but there\u2019s none there now,\u201d said Dimitra, a primary school teacher, who asked not to be fully named. \u201cBut I think we\u2019ll vote to stay in the euro. Both sides have been playing games.\u201d Haris Sakelios, who is unemployed, said he was \u201cquite sure\u201d Greeks would vote No in next Sunday\u2019s referendum \u2013 but that did not necessarily mean Greece would end up leaving the euro. \u201cPeople are tired,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s enough now. So they will vote No. But I think if (prime minister Alexis) Tsipras goes back to the table in Brussels with a referendum result, it will show them he is not alone. He will be stronger.\u201d Spyros Vasilakis, a university teacher, was less confident. \u201cI have no idea what will happen next week,\u201d he said. \u201cThe banks may close. The institutions may withdraw their proposal, in which case what would we technically be voting on? It\u2019s a confused picture right now.\u201d Despina Moragianis, who had been out to a shopping mall in the northern suburbs, said the queues at the banks there were: \u201cLong. I\u2019ve not seen them like that for quite a while. And there were lines at a couple of petrol stations. I think people are concerned, whatever they say.\u201d Time for a recap: Eurozone finance ministers are debating their next move after Greece took the shock decision to announce a referendum on its bailout programme. Arriving in Brussels, the Eurogroup president, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, told reporters he was saddened by the move, following weeks of negotiations, and just five days before the bailout ends. Dijsselbloem suggested that the Eurogroup may have reached the end of the line with Greece, saying: I am very negatively surprised by today\u2019s decision by the Greek government They have apparently rejected the final proposals from the institutions. Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Schauble also said Greece had ended talks. And several other ministers suggested it could be time for Europe to consider Plan B, ie, how to handle a Greek default, and potential exit from the single currency. The IMF\u2019s Christine Lagarde, though, said work would continue with Greece. Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s finance minister, is expected to ask the Eurogroup for a small extension to allow the referendum to be held. In Greece there have been long queues at some cash machines in Athens as people react to Alexisis Tsipras\u2019s shock announcement late last night. At least one bank unexpectedly didn\u2019t open, apparently due to security concerns, leaving a group of people waiting outside. But activity at cash machines in other areas has reportedly been calm, and a top bank official has insisted that machines are being replenished as needed. Greek MPs will vote late tonight (midnight Athens time) on whether to hold the referendum. Opening today\u2019s debate, the interior minister, Nikos Voutsis, urged all parties to back the plan. But some opposition parties are refusing. New Democracy, the rightwing party which lost power in January, has urged the Greek people to vote yes if the referendum is held: And the centrist To Potami opposition party also criticised the plan: A couple more photos from inside the Eurogroup meeting on Greece: The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel has got hold of the latest offer made by Greece\u2019s creditors, and explains how there\u2019s really no new money on offer: On Friday, there was a bit of buzz that creditors had tabled a new \u20ac15.3bn offer to Greece to extend the current bailout through the end of November. But in reality, there was nothing new to it at all. It is essentially all the money left in the bailout, which was presented to Athens in a more fully articulated two-page memo. More here. And here\u2019s the full memo (somewhat crumpled since entering Peter\u2019s tender clutches) Here are a a few photos from inside today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, before it began: While I was watching the Eurogroup in Brussels, Greece\u2019s prime minister was getting a standing ovation from his MPs as he arrived for today\u2019s referendum debate: Newsflash: Yanis Varoufakis has told Reuters that he will ask fellow finance ministers for a bailout extension of \u201ca few weeks\u201d to accommodate the referendum. Here what they just snapped: GREEK FINANCE MINISTER VAROUFAKIS TELLS REUTERS HE WILL ASK EUROGROUP FOR BAILOUT EXTENSION OF FEW WEEKS TO ACCOMMODATE REFERENDUM GREECE\u2019S VAROUFAKIS SAYS GOVT COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENTING OUTCOME OF REFERENDUM AND REACHING QUICK DEAL WITH CREDITORS IN THE SPIRIT OF VOTE RESULT GREECE\u2019S VAROUFAKIS SAYS JUNE 30 IMF PAYMENT DEPENDS ON FLEXIBILITY OF CREDITORS GREECE\u2019S VAROUFAKIS SAYS WANTS EU TO RETURN 1.9 BLN EUROS OF PROFITS ON ECB HOLDINGS OF GREEK GOVT BONDS TO PAY IMF ON TUESDAY GREECE\u2019S VAROUFAKIS SAYS BANKS MUST STAY OPEN DURING BAILOUT TRANSITION PERIOD, CENTRAL BANK ROLE IS TO ENSURE THIS Analysts at Barclays have warned that the referendum plunges Greece into fresh turmoil, whether the result is Yes or No. Here\u2019s a flavour of a note they sent to clients this morning: What happens if Greece votes no? Government officials are currently emphasizing that this is simply a vote on the negotiations and not on the Greek position within the EMU [eurozone] and EU. In reality, the two questions are related. We believe that the odds of a Greek exit increase substantially if Greece votes no. And if capital controls have not been imposed by then, they would almost certainly be after 5 July. What happens if Greece votes yes? Every indication is that the existing Greek government is opposed to the creditors\u2019 current terms. Consequently, it is very possible that in the event of a yes vote, Greece would face a political crisis, with a new government having to be formed in order to finalize the negotiations and implement the agreed-upon reforms. Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s press officer has hit back at Peter Kazimir\u2019s claim that the Greek finance minister lectures the rest of the eurogroup: Eurozone finance ministers have begun debating the Greek situation. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, looks like a man who\u2019d rather be anywhere else than the Eurogroup (his fifth in under two weeks). The Greek government was elected to make decisions, so they should make them, says Ka\u017eim\u00edr. Greece can hold a referendum on anything it wants, but if they reject the package on the table, then the programme is over. Asked what he expects from Yanis Varoufakis, he replies \u201cthe same, the lecturing\u201d, before going into the eurogroup. Ireland\u2019s Michael Noonan says he is \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Greece appears to have unilaterally ended negotiations. He had hoped that finance ministers would have closed the gaps between the two competing proposals at today\u2019s meeting. I don\u2019t know what happens next week, it\u2019s impossible to speculate. We\u2019re entering totally uncharted waters, Noonan adds. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, arrives, and tells a scrum of reporters that there appears to be no basis for further talks with Greece : GERMAN FINMIN SAYS GREECE HAS DECIDED TO END NEGOTIATIONS GERMAN FINMIN SAYS NO BASIS FOR FURTHER TALKS WITH GREECE However: GERMAN FINMIN SAYS YOU CAN NEVER RULE OUT SURPRISES WITH GREECE There have been some rather grim faces among the finance ministers arriving at today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting: Finland\u2019s Alex Stubb has arrived at the Eurogroup, and told reporters that the referendum means we are \u201cclosing the door\u201d on future negotiations. Stubb says: I think there is a clear majority-cum-consensus inside the eurogroup that an extension of the programme is out of the question. I think that as an avid pro-European, yesterdays announcement of a referendum was an unpleasant surprise, and I feel quite sad about the situation, especially from the perspective of the Greek people And speaking to a second reporter inside the building, Stubb adds that: I would argue that Plan B is becoming Plan A. Spain\u2019s finance minister, Luis de Guindos, says that the decision to call a referendum has made life \u201cmore difficult for everyone\u201d, making a successful end to this saga less likely: European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has arrived - and he insists that the game isn\u2019t up: The Commission has always worked on the position that Greece\u2019s place is in the eurozone, says Moscovic: When I look at where we are, I see that there are differences, but they are quite limited, and they are well identified. Where there is a will there is a way, and the Greek government should prove its own will. Could Greece get the extension it has asked for? We will hear from the Institutions (IMF, ECB, EC) and we will speak to the Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis. The proposals on the table are favourable to the Greek government, he insists. Christine Lagarde arrives, looking extremely serious. She starts by expressing the IMF\u2019s condolences and support to the families of the victims who have been killed in the terrorist attacks of recent days (the attacks in Tunisia, Kuwait and France). On Greece, she says: Together with the other institutions, we\u2019ve always shown flexibility in order to adjust to the new economic and political situation in Greece. The porpose of what we\u2019re doing is to restore the stability of the economy in Greece, and restore its financial independence, as in Portugal and Ireland. And that is what we will continue to do. That is slightly more positive than Dijsselbloem\u2019s statement, that the door is closed: Lagarde then spells out the IMF\u2019s position: Greece must implement \u201cdeep\u201d structural reforms and growth-friendly fiscal consolidation... And its partners must provide financial support and \u2018debt operation\u2019. Malta\u2019s finance minister, Edward Scicluna, tells reporters that the referendum has come as a nasty shock to the eurogroup: Democratic government have the right to call a referendum, he points out, but: It\u2019s the timing that is very unfortunate, and that is an understatement. The referendum should have been called months ago, Scicluna argues, once it became clear that the Greek government\u2019s mandate meant it couldn\u2019t accept the proposals on the table. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the eurogroup, has just arrived in Brussels. He tells reporters that: I am very negatively surprised by today\u2019s decision by the Greek government They have apparently rejected the final proposals from the Institutions. Dijsselbloem is also unimpressed that the Greek government is recommending rejecting the proposal: That is a sad decision for Greece, for it has closed the door on future talks. Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has arrived at the meeting. He smiles at the cameras, but doesn\u2019t speak to the assembled press. Belgium\u2019s finance minister, Johan Van Overtveldt, has arrived at the eurogroup meeting in Brussels, and warned that time is running out. Obviously June 30 is coming to us very quickly now, he says, calling the referendum a \u2018bizarre move\u2019. Are we going to see capital controls in Greece? The Eurogroup meeting starts at 2pm. We\u2019ll look at the evidence, and depending on the conclusions, we will take appropriate action, says Van Overtveldt. We can no longer prolong whever action we need to take. We will have to decide on issues today. Finance ministers from centre-right countries are meeting first to discuss Greece, before arriving at the full eurogroup meeting. That\u2019s via Finland\u2019s Alex Stubb: Latest word from Brussels is that eurozone ministers are unlikely to offer Greece an extension at today\u2019s eurogroup: AN EXTENSION OF THE PROGRAMME FOR GREECE AT EUROGROUP ON SAT IS UNLIKELY AS SEVERAL COUNTIRES OPPOSE IT - EURO ZONE OFFICIAL Open Europe\u2019s analyst Raoul Ruparel fears that there are few positive outcomes for Greece now. As he points out, there is no guarantee that the creditors\u2019 offer of a bailout extension will still be on offer when the referendum takes place (it may not even survive today\u2019s eurogroup meeting) He writes: No matter what, capital controls and bank holidays will likely be needed in the short term (and possibly longer) in Greece. Even if the referendum gives a positive outcome, this may still provoke uncertainty. It is not clear whether the deal to be voted on is actually still on the table. Furthermore, Tsipras has set himself up to reject the proposal, so it might be hard to avoid new elections if the people back the creditors. If there is a No vote, this is likely to be seen as a vote for Grexit, since any offer on the table from creditors will be a take it or leave it one. There remains a small chance that the referendum may not come to pass, if a new deal is offered or the bill is not approved by the Greek Parliament or President. However, given Tsipras\u2019 insistence on the referendum, it would again be hard from him to survive such an event. It\u2019s well worth reading the full piece: What will shock Greek referendum mean for the Eurozone and Greece? The government, though, is insisting that a referendum can be held on Greece\u2019s bailout programme, given its importance: It\u2019s going to be a long debate.... Venizelos is insisting that the terms of Greece\u2019s bailout simply isn\u2019t an issue of national security, so it can\u2019t be the subject of a referendum.... Amid occasional barracking and constant low-level grumbling, Evangelos Venizelos is insisting that the Greek constitution prohibits referendum on fiscal issues. Votes on national issues are allowed, but they mean foreign policy not financial matters, he tells MPs. Back in the Athens parliament, things are getting heated. Former deputy PM Evangelos Venizelos is on his feet, questioning whether a referendum is constitutional. He\u2019s reminding MPs that Alexis Tsipras was highly critical of ex PM George Papandreou\u2019s (failed) attempt to hold a referendum in 2011, calling it a \u201ctrick\u201d to keep himself in power. Over in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are starting to arrive for today\u2019s extraordinary meeting on Greece. Our Southern Europe editor, John Hooper, reports a queue at a cash machine in Syntagma Square (the site of the parliament) The head of the Greek Bank Association, Louka Katseli, has assured the Athens News Agency that cash machines are being \u201creplenished smoothly.\u201d Katseli, who also chairs the National Bank of Greece added that any \u201cisolated problems\u201d due to an increase in outflows is being dealt with \u201cas soon as possible\u201d by the Central Bank of Greece. (via Reuters). Syriza MPs have been applauding warmly at several points, including as Voutsis concludes his speech. Nicos Voutsis is telling MPs that the referendum can help end austerity in Greece: Twitter user Diane Shugart is tweeting the key points: Greece\u2019s interior minister, Nikos Voutsis, has opened the debate. He criticises the country\u2019s lenders, and calls on all parties to vote in favour of holding a referendum: A unanimous decision would give us a stronger negotiating position, he argues, confirming that Syriza will vote \u201cNo\u201d. The referendum debate is being streamed live here. A senior member of Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party says there is no chance of the Bundestag approving a short-term extension to the Greek bailout: Gunther Krichbaum added that the Greek PM has \u201cpulled the plug\u201d: MERKEL ALLY KRICHBAUM SAYS DOESN\u2019T SEE MAJORITY IN CONSERVATIVE PARTY FOR GREEK EXTENSION THROUGH JULY 5TH KRICHBAUM SAYS TSIPRAS \u2018HAS PULLED THE PLUG\u2019 HIMSELF WITH REFERENDUM CALL, MEANS NO VOTE IN GERMAN PARLIAMENT BY TUESDAY ON GREEK AID The debate in the Greek parliament has begun, around 90 minutes later than billed: It is not only on the streets that tensions are on the rise, reports our correspondent Helena Smith. In parliament, where party leaders have rushed to convene emergency meetings, the rhetoric is also becoming ever more shrill. Addressing her MPs, the newly elected leader of the left-wing Pasok party, Fofi Gennimatas, said it was important the referendum did not take place . She said: \u201cThey are gambling with the country. The real question is \u2018yes or no\u2019 to Europe.\u201d Greece\u2019s defense minister Panos Kammenos, who heads the government\u2019s junior partner, the right-wing nationalist Independent Greeks party, has been busy talking to reporters this morning and has heartedly denied that Greeks have been posed with the dilemma of having to choose between the euro or drachma. \u201cWe tried to compromise with lenders, this is about national dignity, about ending an era of humiliation of Greeks,\u201d he said as he made his way through a crush of reporters outside parliament. Minister of state Alekos Flambouraris, widely seen as prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 mentor, rejected suggestions that Greeks were now being forced to make a choice about their future in the single currency. \u2018That is propaganda,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is part of the negotiating [process].\u201d The far right Golden Dawn leader Nikos Michaloliakos has also waded in saying his party will call on Greeks to reject creditors\u2019 proposals when the referendum is held next Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ll call on Greeks to say no to the profiteers and all those who for five years have wanted to humiliate our homeland,\u201d he railed in typically combattive mood outside the 300-member House. MPs representing the conservative New Democracy party, meanwhile, have been busy lambasting the government for calling the referendum but predicted that Greeks would say \u2018a big yes\u2019 to Europe and the euro. Delaying the referendum vote means Greek MPs should know the result of today\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Greece (unless that also runs on until midnight!) We\u2019re now hearing that the vote on whether to hold a referendum has been pushed back to midnight Athens time, from 7pm. Freelance journalist Nick Barnets reports that it\u2019s business as usual in his area of central Athens: That backs up what Helena reported earlier - there are queues in some parts of town, but it\u2019s not a panic. Reuters has been told that \u2018security issues\u2019 were the reason one Greek bank didn\u2019t open as usual this morning (causing that queue flagged up earlier): By mid-morning, there were dozens queuing outside a branch of Piraeus Bank in central Athens, although that is not unusual as many Greeks who don\u2019t use cash cards come to banks on Saturdays. The bank was still closed nearly an hour after it was meant to open at 0730 GMT. A senior executive at Piraeus said it intended to open the branch but was considering security issues because of the queues. Many banks in Greece are usually closed on Saturdays but some lenders keep open one or two branches for a few hours. And one central bank official told Reuters that: \u201cThe Bank of Greece is making a huge effort to keep ATMs fed with cash,\u201d The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel has heard that eurozone finance ministers are very unlikely to accept Greece\u2019s request for a short bailout extension to accommodate the referendum, when they meet today. Ministers were already expected to work on a Plan B for Greece, if their latest offer of a five-month extension was rejected, as Ian Traynor explained last night: Greek government ministers have been making their way into parliament, where the governing Syriza party is to hold a meeting of its political secretariat: Asked if banks were at risk, the interior minister Nikos Vroutsis told reporters minutes ago: \u201cI am very optimistic and optimistic about banks.\u201d Dimitris Stratoulis, the deputy social security minister, said the referendum would arm the leftist-led government with renewed determination to forge ahead with its programme. \u201cWhy should [the result of the vote] have negative consequences?\u201d he asked. \u201cI am optimistic, optimistic that Greeks will say a resounding \u2018no\u2019 to their [creditors\u2019] brazen demands.\u201d Over in Athens, our correspondent Helena Smith says queues now forming outside banks are noticeably longer in the less affluent areas of the capital. In the suburbs of Athens, especially in areas worst hit by the biting effects of austery, queues are much longer than they are down town. In the plush area of Kolonaki, it is coffee shops that are drawing people, not banks, according to my colleague John Hooper who happens to be just there. In the historic district of Plaka, home to some of the wealthiest Greeks, too, and from where I now write these lines (from my humble office), there are -- with the exception of tourists attempting to withdraw cash -- almost no lines outside banks. My colleague Jon Henley is tweeting from the Greek capital: Euro zone finance ministers are still planning to hold their emergency meeting on Greece today, despite the referendum, one EU official has told Reuters. The meeting is due to start at 2pm Brussels time (1pm UK, 3pm Athens) Greece will ask the Eurogroup to extend their bailout programme by a few days, beyond 30 June, to accommodate the referendum. But there is no guarantee that this will be granted. And if Greece is no longer in a bailout programme, it is harder for the European Central Bank to keep providing emergency funds. More from Sky\u2019s reporting team in Athens: And here\u2019s another queue outside a Greek bank in the capital, via Associated Press (who say it didn\u2019t actually open in the end) From Athens, Sky News\u2019s Rob Nisbet reports a long queue at one ATM machine: \u201cWe would consider the recent turn of events as a particularly negative market outcome\u201d. That\u2019s the snap verdict from Deutsche Bank, who say the question of Greece\u2019s membership of the euro is now \u201cofficially opened\u201d. Here\u2019s the key points from a new research note issued by DB this morning: First, the European political response. A Euro leaders summit may be called at short notice. Similarly to the Papandreou referendum proposal in 2012, we expect that Europeans will make it clear that the government\u2019s referendum will be equivalent to a question on euro membership. The Europeans will also need to decide on whether to grant a short-term legal extension to the loan agreement. Though we are still waiting for the European reaction, we consider a more likely outcome that the program is allowed to expire: extension requires multiple parliamentary approval processes, and given the tone of the Greek PM\u2019s speech it is unlikely that the political appetite exists to grant such an extension. The IMF response will also be important: when and if Lagarde notifies the IMF board of a non-payment event, this will trigger cross-default on Greece\u2019s EFSF loans and the EFSF board of directors (the finance ministers) will have the option, but not the obligation, to call these loans immediately due and payable. Second, the ECB response. The central bank has been holding daily reviews of Greek bank ELA provision this week, and officials have in multiple statements last week made it clear that ongoing liquidity provision is based on a \u201ccredible perspective\u201d of an agreement being reached. Decisions are likely to be taken in conjunction with the European political response and program extension this weekend. The situation remains very fluid, but as things stand we consider the most likely outcome being an ECB decision not to raise ELA funding beyond existing levels as of this past Friday, or alternatively an aggressive adjustment in collateral haircuts resulting in an implicit cap at some point next week. The Greek deputy PM has said he will seek a meeting with ECB\u2019s Draghi on Saturday. The third factor to watch will be public opinion polls on the referendum question. So far, these have shown that support for euro membership when an \u201cunconditional\u201d (\u201csimple\u201d) question is asked stands at around 70%. However, when this question is made conditional on more austerity, support drops to 55--65% depending on how the question is phrased. We expect the Greek PM\u2019s position and the phrasing of the question itself to likely lead to additional swing towards a \u201cno\u201d vote. This is particularly so as Greek government officials have stated that the referendum will not be on euro membership, but rather the agreement. The extent to which European pressure and the situation of the banking system next week swings the vote the other way remains an open question. Overall, we expect the outcome to be very close and uncertain. The closer opinion polls are to a \u201cno\u201d vote, the greater probability is the market likely to price to a Greek Eurozone exit. Greece will be given a straight choice whether to accept, or reject, the package of measures drawn up by the IMF, ECB and EU: Ladbrokes, the betting firm, reckons that Greeks are likely to reject the proposal drawn up by its lenders: The head of the junior coalition party in Greece, Panos Kammenos, has told Greeks to remain calm, as banks will remain open. Kammenos told local TV that the decision to call a referendum shouldn\u2019t spark alarm. \u201cCitizens should not be scared - there is no blackmail,\u201d \u201cThe banks won\u2019t shut, the ATMs will (have cash). All this is exaggeration.\u201d Kammenos, who leads the populist right-wing Independent Greek party, has also suggested that the referendum could yet be cancelled if creditors blink. There are signs that worried Greeks are heading to the cash machines in greater numbers this morning. Denis MacShane, the former Labour MP, says he\u2019s had some trouble getting money out in Athens: However, the situation seems calm on the Greek island of Poros: Good morning. Europe has woken up to a new phase of uncertainty this morning after Greek Alexis Tsipras stunned the nation, and beyond, by calling a referendum on its bailout deal. By taking the issue to the people, Tsipras has ensured that the next week or so will be absolutely critical for deciding Greece\u2019s future in the eurozone. Starting right now. Greek PMs will be heading to parliament shortly to vote on whether to back Tsipras\u2019s plan for a national vote on Sunday 5th June. The debate starts at noon local time (or 10am BST), with a vote expected seven hours later. A simple majority is all it needs to put the issue in the hands of the Greek population. And while that\u2019s happening, eurozone finance ministers will be heading to Brussels for another Eurogroup meeting. That session was due to start at 1pm Central European time (2pm Athens, or noon BST). Ministers were expected to see Greece handed a \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it\u201d offer, in return for a bailout extension. Tsipras, though, has already dismissed this offer of \u201csevere and humiliating austerity without end\u201d, and is asking creditors for a short extension to the current bailout (which expires on Tuesday). Will they agree, or will they press on with work on a \u201cPlan B\u201d for Greece, including capital controls? Tsipras\u2019s decision to take the issue to the people has already fanned fears over its banks ability to keep running; will the European Central Bank continue to provide emergency help? As our Athens correspondent Helena Smith reported: Describing the vote as a \u201chistoric decision\u201d, Tsipras said he had informed the leaders of France, Germany and Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank about the decision. \u201cI asked them to extend our current bailout by a few days so this democratic process could take place,\u201d he said. Greeks would be asked whether they wanted to accept or reject excoriating tax hikes and pension cuts that the EU, ECB and International Monetary Fund have set as a condition to release desperately needed bailout funds. Greece\u2019s current rescue programme, already extended once, expires on 30 June. Panic-stricken depositors, worried that capital controls may only be hours away, rushed to ATMs to withdraw savings. Queues quickly formed outside banks around the capital . After months of wrangling between the Greek government and its creditors, matters are finally, dramatically, coming to a head. I\u2019ll be tracking all the action though the day.....",

On Saturday, they rejected a request by Tsipras to extend the current bailout in order to cover the period leading up to the referendum.

The country plunged towards financial collapse after its leftwing prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/alexis-tsipras\">Alexis Tsipras</a>, abandoned negotiations and called a referendum on his lenders\u2019 terms for continuing the lifeline.</p> <p data-dropid=\"2\">An emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers took place in Brussels on Saturday evening without Greece for the first time since the crisis began in 2010. It turned into a crisis planning session devoted to quarantining <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/greece\">Greece</a> and insulating the rest of the eurozone from the impact of anticipated financial mayhem.</p> <p data-dropid=\"3\">The weekend events threw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> into weeks of confusion and turbulence as 10 days of intense last-ditch attempts to salvage an agreement between Greece and its creditors collapsed. Tsipras accused the country\u2019s creditors of a vengeful act of humiliation against Greece and urged voters to follow him in rejecting the terms imposing more austerity in return for cash in the plebiscite on 5 July.</p> <p data-dropid=\"4\">The finance ministers refused to extend Greece\u2019s bailout beyond Tuesday, hastening the likelihood of Greece\u2019s ejection from the euro. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/yanis-varoufakis\">Yanis Varoufakis</a>, the Greek finance minister, refused to endorse the collective statement and left the meeting.</p> <p data-dropid=\"5\">Tsipras\u2019s gamble, following an EU summit in Brussels on Friday, leaves Europe\u2019s leaders, notably Angela Merkel of Germany and Mario Draghi, the president of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank\">European Central Bank</a>, with a stark dilemma \u2013 whether to let Greece sink or swim...</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://t.co/bXazn5ki9s\"><strong>More here</strong></a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/traynorbrussels/statuses/614886108799836160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">EU ministers refuse bailout extension for Greece as referendum looms <a href=\"http://t.co/bXazn5ki9s\">http://t.co/bXazn5ki9s</a></p>&mdash;

Given the prolonged deadlock in negotiations and the urgency of the situation, institutions have put forward a comprehensive proposal on policy conditionality, making use of the given flexibility within the current arrangement. </p> <p>Regrettably, despite efforts at all levels and full support of the Eurogroup, this proposal has been rejected by the Greek authorities who broke off the programme negotiations late on the 26 June unilaterally. The Eurogroup recalls the significant financial transfers and support provided to Greece over the last years. The Eurogroup has been open until the very last moment to further support the Greek people through a continued growth-oriented programme. </p> <p>The Eurogroup takes note of the decision of the Greek government to put forward a proposal to call for a referendum, which is expected to take place on Sunday July 5, which is after the expiration of the programme period. The current financial assistance arrangement with Greece will expire on 30 June 2015, as well as all agreements related to the current Greek programme including the transfer by euro area Member States of SMP and ANFA equivalent profits. </p> <p>The euro area authorities stand ready to do whatever is necessary to ensure financial stability of the euro area.

Similarly to the Papandreou referendum proposal in 2012, we expect that Europeans will make it clear that the government\u2019s referendum will be equivalent to a question on euro membership. The Europeans will also need to decide on whether to grant a short-term legal extension to the loan agreement. Though we are still waiting for the European reaction, we consider a more likely outcome that the program is allowed to expire: extension requires multiple parliamentary approval processes, and given the tone of the Greek PM\u2019s speech it is unlikely that the political appetite exists to grant such an extension. The IMF response will also be important: when and if Lagarde notifies the IMF board of a non-payment event, this will trigger cross-default on Greece\u2019s EFSF loans and the EFSF board of directors (the finance ministers) will have the option, but not the obligation, to call these loans immediately due and payable.</p> <h2><strong>Second, the ECB response.</strong> </h2> <p>The central bank has been holding daily reviews of Greek bank ELA provision this week, and officials have in multiple statements last week made it clear that ongoing liquidity provision is based on a \u201ccredible perspective\u201d of an agreement being reached. Decisions are likely to be taken in conjunction with the European political response and program extension this weekend. The situation remains very fluid, but as things stand we consider the most likely outcome being an ECB decision not to raise ELA funding beyond existing levels as of this past Friday, or alternatively an aggressive adjustment in collateral haircuts resulting in an implicit cap at some point next week. The Greek deputy PM has said he will seek a meeting with ECB\u2019s Draghi on Saturday.</p> <h2><strong>The third factor to watch will be public opinion polls</strong> on the referendum question. </h2> <p>So far, these have shown that support for euro membership when an \u201cunconditional\u201d (\u201csimple\u201d) question is asked stands at around 70%. However, when this question is made conditional on more austerity, support drops to 55--65% depending on how the question is phrased. We expect the Greek PM\u2019s position and the phrasing of the question itself to likely lead to additional swing towards a \u201cno\u201d vote. This is particularly so as Greek government officials have stated that the referendum will not be on euro membership, but rather the agreement. The extent to which European pressure and the situation of the banking system next week swings the vote the other way remains an open question.
