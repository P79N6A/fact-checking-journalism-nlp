      "bodyText": "Argentina's government has hit back at a group of creditors that could force the beleagured country into bankruptcy, saying in an advert published in newspapers across the globe that it would fight their court actions. The advert denounced a recent court ruling in favour of hedge fund investors and the US Supreme Court's refusal to sit in judgement on the long-running dispute. Produced by the ministry of foreign affairs, the advert called on the US courts to judge the situation fairly and set a sustainable precedent for other sovereign debt defaults. \"A decision of the US judiciary favourable to 1.6% of the bondholders, who are specialised in litigation, jeopardises a debt restructuring voluntarily accepted by 92.4% of the creditors,\" it says. The investors bought Argentine government bonds at a big discount after the country defaulted on its debts in 2001. Last week the US Supreme Court refused to intervene in a lower court's ruling, effectively deciding that Argentina must pay the funds the full $1.3bn (\u00a3766m) value of the debt. \"Paying the vulture funds is a path leading to default,\" says the advert. Argentina's president, Cristina Fernandez, who has said Argentina cannot afford to pay in full the hedge funds while also making payments to other lenders, has called the funds \"vultures\". Late last week, signs of a possible resolution emerged when Fernandez said she would seek a US judge's support for resolving all of Argentina's unpaid debts in one grand bargain. Economy Minister Axel Kicillof said Fernandez planned to ask District Court Judge Thomas Griesa in New York to impose a stay on debt rulings to allow the country to make payments to creditors of restructured bonds on 30 June. Her note of conciliation helped lift prices of Argentine bonds. Still, dangers remain. The court ruling said that if Argentina did not give the plaintiffs all the money they were due, it would be refused access to the US banking system to make its other interest payments, which are due on 30 June. The full-page message was published in the weekend edition of the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and appears in the Guardian on Tuesday. \"Argentina wants to carry on paying its debts, as it has been doing since 2005,\" the advert reads. \"But the country has been prevented by the ruling from judge Thomas Griesa [in August 2013] and the Supreme Court's decision [last week] to refuse to take on the case,\" it adds. The rebel investors are led by NML Capital, a subsidiary of Elliot Capital Management, run by billionaire Paul Singer. Singer, a lawyer by training, has in the past successfully sued the governments of Peru and the Republic of the Congo to make good on their bonds. Other creditors agreed to cut a deal with Argentina in 2005 and again in 2010 by swapping their bonds for new ones worth less. This helped Argentina's government slash its debts.

    "webTitle": "Supermarkets agree time limit on forensic audits of suppliers' accounts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Eight major grocers have agreed to put a time limit on forensic investigations of suppliers' accounts that they use to search for money they might be owed. The voluntary agreement comes after the new Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA), which oversees a code of conduct governing the major food stores' treatment of their suppliers, found that supermarkets and other food retailers have been using forensic accountants to examine emails up to six years old in an attempt to claim payments that could run into millions of pounds. The agreement, signed by all the major grocers except Sainsbury's and Waitrose, is the first industry-wide deal negotiated by a new industry watchdog. Retailers employ special teams to examine old email trails in which deals are hastily cut in disputes over the quality, quantity or timing of deliveries. Those payments or rebates may then be missed in the cut-and-thrust of daily trade. In the past suppliers have faced multiple investigations for the same period with the aid of sophisticated software and sometimes aggressive no-win, no-fee auditors as retailers aim to squeeze suppliers for cash. Christine Tacon, appointed as GCA a year ago, said suppliers who wanted to challenge the sometimes questionable or unreasonable demands of retailers over historic rebates or payments were forced to hire their own team of specialists. \"There was an implication that most of these arrangements had some ambiguity and there is a huge amount of work for suppliers to challenge them while some felt very threatened,\" she said. Tacon said the new deal would help reduce costs for suppliers, but would be beneficial for the whole industry: \"Some of these ideas are about finding more ways to get suppliers to pay for things, but they are just adding complexity and costs for everyone.\" However, Sainsbury's and Waitrose said they had not signed up because the GCA's voluntary agreement was too weak to hold any real sway over retailers and could mask poor practice. They pointed out that it did not change retailers' legal right to investigate accounts over a six-year period. A Sainsbury's spokesperson admitted that the retailer investigated suppliers' accounts as far back as six years in some instances and more regularly over four years. They said: \"Given our excellent record in supplier relations, the agreement isn't really relevant to us. Standardised industry agreements that are voluntary are not the best way forward. Experience shows they can often simply provide camouflage for those who have not seriously addressed an issue.\" A spokeswoman for Waitrose said the retailer was supportive of the work of the GCA, but added: \"We believe that the length of time is not the issue, the important thing is the manner and the spirit in which the audit is carried out.\" The forensic investigations were one of the top five complaints from suppliers received by Tacon in her first year in office and among the most financially damaging. Nearly 80% of suppliers said they believed retailers they dealt with were not compliant with the Grocery Supply Code of Practice, which was first introduced in 2001 after a Competition Commission inquiry. However, nearly 60% said they were still afraid to complain to the GCA because of fear of reprisals from retailers, while 41% said they didn't feel Tacon would be able to help. The top complaints from suppliers were retailers deducting payments when they unilaterally rule that suppliers have not delivered the amount of goods agreed and penalising suppliers for not delivering the required amount of goods, even when this is more than the amount initially requested, followed by requests for lump sums of cash to help retailers achieve their required profit targets. Suppliers were also upset by retailers demanding they pay over the odds for new packaging. They allege retailers get a kickback from stipulating that their suppliers source packaging from a particular company who charges the food manufacturer over the odds. Tacon told a conference to mark her first year in office that she had heard a mass of conflicting evidence on payments for packaging, with suppliers saying they faced charges which ran into six or seven figures that could be deducted from their invoices without agreement. Tacon indicated that packaging payments could be her first formal investigation, which could lead to financial penalties or \"naming and shaming\" of retailers who have broken the code of conduct. \"This is an area I am warming up to investigate as I can't get to the bottom of it,\" she said.",

Central banks, despite what they say, do not know for sure what the long-term impact on inflation of all this money creation will be. That's the third and final reason for taking inflation seriously. Nick Parsons, head of strategy at National Australia Bank in London, says rising US inflation is going to be the next big focus of market attention. In that respect, it doesn't really matter what Yellen thinks. All that's required for some fun and games in the equity, bond and currency markets is for the markets to think that she is being too complacent about inflation. Which they increasingly do.",

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up, after a day in which Europe's economy showed worrying signs that it's recovery may be faltering, just as America's factory sector bursts back. Reuters sums up the day (I've added links to the key points in the blog) Global manufacturing activity appeared to accelerate in June, buoyed by a return to growth in China and Japan and the fastest expansion in the U.S. factory sector in more than four years. Surveys of manufacturers around the world released on Monday gave some positive signals for the global economic outlook, but dark clouds remained over Europe, where an unexpectedly sharp fall in French business activity dragged on the wider euro zone. The data suggested Beijing's targeted stimulus measures and Japan's improving labor market were helping domestic demand in Asia's dominant economies.The HSBC/Markit Flash China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose more than expected to 50.8 in June from 49.4 a month earlier. The 50-point level separates growth in activity from contraction.\"The authorities' mini-stimulus is filtering through to the real economy,\" said Qu Hongbin, chief economist for China at HSBC. China's government has unveiled a series of modest measures to support economic growth in recent months, including reserve requirement cuts for some banks that could encourage lending. The Markit/JMMA flash Japan Manufacturing PMI also rose in June, hitting 51.1 and showing the first growth in three months. External demand remained weak for the two export powerhouses, and some analysts think China may need more stimulus to offset a cooling housing market and avoid a sharp slowdown in economic growth.Japan's weak exports also take the gloss off the government's efforts to breathe new life into its economic reform agenda. But in a more positive sign for global demand, U.S. factories showed their strongest growth in activity since May 2010, with Markit's preliminary PMI rising to 57.5. That bolsters expectations U.S. factories will grow busier in the second half of this year, said Barclays economist Cooper Howes. While the data was generally positive for the factories of the world's biggest economies, there were more worrisome signs within Europe. Germany and France went their separate ways again, with German business activity expanding robustly, albeit at a slower pace than last month, while France's private sector shrank at the fastest rate in four months. Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics said: \"The recovery has not gained as much traction as people had hoped. It's definitely a concern.\" Markit's composite PMI, based on surveys of thousands of companies across the 18 countries that use the euro, fell to 52.8 from May's 53.5. That was well below the consensus in a Reuters survey and matched the lowest forecast polled. Markit said that with a robust recovery taking place in some euro zone periphery countries, the data still point to second-quarter economic growth of 0.4 percent. Germany, Europe's largest economy, was again the driving force although its composite PMI eased to 54.2, while the French index slumped to 48.0, its lowest reading since February. Also somewhat worryingly for the European Central Bank, a composite PMI sub-index measuring output prices held below the 50 mark for the 27th month, coming in at 49.7 as firms kept cutting prices despite soaring input costs. Inflation in the euro area slowed to just 0.5 percent in May, prompting the ECB to cut interest rates to record lows and offer new long-term loans to banks to help boost lending to euro zone companies. \"The further weakening of the PMI vindicates the ECB's recent decision to implement further monetary easing and will keep fears of a Japanification of Europe firmly alive,\" said Martin van Vliet at ING. Back tomorrow. Goodnight! GW The AA has made an inauspicious debut on the stock market, shedding 7% to end its first day's trading at 232.5p, having floated at 250p this morning. ETX Capital explains: Traders are growing a little weary of IPOs in recent weeks given the lofty valuations which some new entrants to the stock market are sitting on, raising worries that forward earnings do not match. At the same time, there\u2019s a bit of skepticism surrounding this IPO as well as other floats which involved private equity firms offloading their stakes to raise cash. There's also some cynicism about the AA float, as it's being sold by private equity (PE) firms: PE firms who have been unable to provide returns to their clients have hastily offloaded stakes in companies as a result. A PE firm wouldn't dispose of its holding in a company it deems successful and profitable so the market may be taking this as a warning. European financial markets have ended the day with losses across the board, as this morning's disappointing French private sector data hit confidence. The FTSE 100 fell 0.5%, the German DAX lost 0.6%, the French CAC dropped 0.5%, the Spanish IBEX dropped 0.2% and the Italian FTSE MIB dropped 1.1%. In London, building companies led the fallers after David Miles, one of the most dovish members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, indicated that interest rates should rise in the coming months. Over in South Africa, it appears that the long-running strike held by platinum workers is over. Shares in Lonmin, hit by the strike, have jumped 7% on the news. Here's how Reuters reported it: PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA'S STRIKING AMCU UNION BEGINS TO ADDRESS WORKERS AT RALLY TO DECIDE ON PLATINUM WAGE OFFERS AMCU PRESIDENT TELLS RALLY OF STRIKING MINERS THAT \"TODAY WE ARE CREATING A HISTORIC DAY IN THE MINING SECTOR\" AMCU UNION PRESIDENT READS OUT 1,000 RAND A MONTH WAGE INCREASE FROM ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM AMSJ.J TO MASS RALLY AMCU UNION PRESIDENT SAYS LONMIN WAGE OFFER IS ALSO FOR THREE YEARS AMCU UNION PRESIDENT SAYS IMPALA PLATINUM IMPJ.J WAGE OFFER ALSO THREE YEARS AMCU PRESIDENT SAYS 236 DIMISSSED WORKERS FROM LONMIN TO BE REINSTATED AMCU PRESIDENT SAYS MANY WORKERS WILL GET 12,500 RAND PER MONTH \"EVEN BEFORE THIS THREE YEAR AGREEMENT IS OVER\" PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA'S AMCU UNION ASKS CROWD: \"DO YOU WANT TO SIGN WAGE OFFER?\" CROWD ERUPTS IN CHEERS WHEN ASKED IF THEY WANT TO SIGN WAGE Sounds like quite a moment.... Just in -- Fitch has slashed Tesco's credit rating by one notch to BBB - just two places above \"junk\". Fitch fears that Tesco's operating margins will come under pressure as it cuts prices to try to keep its market share. It's the latest warning shot that the supermarket faces difficult trading conditions and tough competition; last month, Moody's downgraded Tesco to the same level. Another point in today's US homes sales data -- 'distressed sales' (ie, of repossessed homes) has tumbled. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says that \"US industry is booming again\", after last winter's bad winter hit economic output. Analysing today's report, Williamson says: The strong reading also rounds off the best quarter for factories for four years, adding to indications that the US economy rebounded strongly in the second quarter from the weather-related weakness seen at the start of the year. \u201cThe survey data suggest that GDP should be set to rise by at least 3.0% after the 1.0% decline in the first quarter. \u201cIf there\u2019s a weak spot it\u2019s the near-stagnation of exports, which raises the possibility that trade will have acted as a drag on the economy in the second quarter. \u201cHiring also continued at a robust pace as firms boosted capacity in line with the strong demand, broadly consistent with factories taking on another 12,000 staff during the month. The job markets gains will fuel hopes that we will see yet another month of approximately 200,000 non-farm payroll growth in June.\u201d Strategist Jeffrey Kleintop is concerned that today's data shows inflation pressures rising -- is the Fed ignoring the risk? CPI=consumer prices index And a fund manager who blogs as Barnejek points out several signs that the US economy is picking up pace. UST = US Treasuries, or government bonds. Yes, he's being ironic.... More strong US data: existing home sales across America rose by 4.9% in April to the fastest rate in seven months. Today's US manufacturing data also shows that cost pressures are building in the US economy -- fuel for those economists who think the Federal Reserve is downplaying the inflation risk*. Markit reports that cost inflation hits five-month high. Input prices (what firms have to pay for raw materials) rose at the fastest rate since January, while factory gate prices (what they charge for their goods) rose for the first time in 2014. However: That said, the latest rise in manufacturers\u2019 output charges was only moderate and remained weaker than the long- run series average. (* - check out Business Insider for more: There's A Big Disagreement Between Wall Street And The Fed \u2014 And It Will Be The Story Of The Summer). Breaking: The US manufacturing sector is enjoying a blow-out month, with output, new orders and job creation all rising strongly in June. That's according to Markit's 'flash' PMI, which jumped to 57.5 in June, up from 56.4 in May. That shows that the sector grew at its fastest rate in four years. The survey, based on interviews with Purchasing Managers at factories across America, is packed with signs that America's factory sector is romping ahead this month. Output rose for the third month running. New orders grew at the fastest pace since April 2010, Firms kept hiring more staff -- with payroll numbers at manufacturing firms increasing for the twelfth successive month in June. And there are signs of inflationary pressures building -- which is going to add to talk that US inflation is picking up. Reaction to follow! In the meantime, here's more details: Wall Street is open, and shares have dipped as the downbeat mood in Europe (see 9.38am) ripple across the Atlantic. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 34 points, or 0.2%, at 16912. It could get livelier in a few minutes, when the 'flash' estimates for US manufacturing output this month are released (at 2.45pm BST/9.45am EST), followed by the latest new home sales. Just in - the Bank of Israel has left interest rates unchanged, at 0.75%. It also trimmed its growth forecast for 2014 to 2.9%, down from 3.1%. It still expects growth of around 3% in 2015. Dubai's stock market has fallen in bear market territory, having fallen more than a fifth from its recent peak less than six weeks ago. The main Dubai index fell another 4.3% today, to close at 4296 points. That's more than 20% down on the 5406-point intraday high reached in mid-May; officially, that puts the index into 'correction' territory. The selloff was driven down by construction firm Arabtec whose shares fell 10% (the maximum daily fall permitted). Arabtec shares tumbled on reports that it had laid off hundreds of staff, following the resignation of its CEO, Hasan Ismaik, last week. Arabtec had been aiming to become one of the world's 10 biggest construction firms, but recent instability has alarmed investors. It's not really clear what's gone wrong at Arabtec, but Businessweek has a theory: Abu Dhabi state-run Aabar Investments PJSC cut its stake to 18.85% as of June 11 from 21.57%, stoking speculation the builder was losing government backing. One thing is clear -- traders in Dubai are alarmed. Marwan Shurrab, fund manager and head of trading at Vision Investments, says: \"I think that the main reason for this is the ambiguity around Arabtec which is affecting the sentiment on the market and causing some panic selling across the board.\" Wadah Al Taha, chief investment officer of Dubai-based Al Zarooni Group, was even gloomier - telling Bloomberg that: \u201cThere is confusion in the market and I call it Arabtec fever. It\u2019s contagious and affecting every single share in the market.\u201d That was quick! US bio-pharma firm AbbVie has hit back in its takeover battle with Shire, by raising its own guidance for profits this year. AbbVie now expects to deliver earnings of $3.06 to $3.16 a share on an adjusted basis, up by six cents. It also reckons that the positive trend in sales growth will continue through the rest of the year. Pharmaceuticals firm Shire has played the AstraZeneca defence today, as it tries to fight off a takeover bid of its own from a US rival. Shire, which rejected a \u00a327bn takeover offer from AbbVie on Friday, has now given details of how it will double its annual revenues to $10bn by 2020. The presentation (online here) shows how Shire can (it claims) achieve double-digit compound annual product sales growth, led by its Rare Diseases and Neuroscience operations. Lemming Ornskov, chief executive officer of Shire, urged investors to resist the lure of AbbVie's dollars, saying: We have put in place the team and the strategy which have already led to a marked acceleration in product sales over the last 12 months. He also reminds shareholders that its total shareholder return, including reinvestments of dividends, since the start of May 2013 has been 99%. It's a bold strategy - but it did work for AstraZeneca.... In the auto sector, three Japanese carmakers have announced they are recalling millions of cars between them, because of a fault with their airbags. It's a serious problem too. The airbags, created by Takata, have a risk of exploding and shooting out shrapnel at drivers and passengers. It 's also a reminder that, for all the grief that General Motors has (rightly) received over its huge product recalls which are linked to at least 13 deaths, other manufacturers ship flawed products too. Honda said it was recalling about two million cars, including one million in the US, around 670,000 in Japan and 154,000 cars within Europe (45,000 are in the UK). Nissan is recalling 755,000 vehicles worldwide, while Mazda will call back 159,807 vehicles. Honda car owners can check here if their car is affected, while Mazda has info here. Honda recalls nearly 2m cars in airbag scare Speaking of the AA, Paul Murphy of FT Alphaville points out that the company hasn't actually released its prospectus yet, even though shares are now changing hands in the City after today's placing with institutions. That, he explains, allows 'em to control the news: Media treatment is restricted to the narrow confines of the offer price announcement; by the time the prospectus comes out the press spotlight has invariably moved on\u2026 I suspect Murphy's eagle eye won't have strayed too far, though... The AA has made a low-key debut on the stock exchange this morning, with shares barely getting out of first gear. Shares hit the road at 250p, but quickly went into reverse, bumping the 231p mark before rallying back a little to 240p, a drop of 4%. That won't alarm the private equity firms who sold their entire holding in AA to City investors for \u00a31.18bn, but might make the AA's new investors (who bought stakes through an institutional placing rather than a full float) a little nervous. AA shares get off to slow start in flotation There are signs that UK mortgage lenders are preparing to tighten mortgage lending availability, for those with small deposits. The latest Bank of England credit conditions survey, released this morning, show that lenders expected to offer fewer high loan-to-value loans in the third quarter of this year. That's probably a response to the prospect of the BoE raising rates within the year, and possibly taking new steps to cool the market later this week. But overall \"secured credit\" is expected to be unchanged, and banks also expect to advance more unsecured credit. This chart shows how banks offered many more high loan-to-value ratio loans in the first half of 2014. But there's no sign of more loans flowing to businesses, even though corporate lending demand increased \"significantly\". Overall credit availability to the corporate sector was reported to have been broadly unchanged in the last quarter, having risen for the previous 18 months. The blue bar lines show availability (so this quarter's bar is 'missing'), while the red diamonds tracks expectations for the coming quarter. Aengus Collins, Europe analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, is also worried that the eurozone recovery is flagging. And no prizes for guessing which country is the most concerning: \"France is a particular worry, slumping to a reading of 48. Given that real GDP stagnated in the first quarter--propped up by government spending--and that a host of indicators point to continuing weakness in the private sector, there is now a real prospect that the economy contracted in the second quarter, and that a return to solid growth remains some distance off. A stabilisation of new business levels in the French services sector provides some reassurance, but on almost every other sub-component the PMI paints a picture of an economy in trouble.\u201d Analysts at ETX Capital say this morning's data disappointed traders, with Germany's PMI index hitting an eight-month low, and France's showing a \"stuttering economy\" contracting again. All in all, the data from the Eurozone certainly has not invigorated the market today. In the UK, chancellor George Osborne gave Bank of England governor Mark Carney a thumbs-up this morning, over his warning that interest rates could rise sooner than expected. Speaking on BBC TV, Osborne said: \"I think it is a good thing we actually have a bank governor who goes out and does a lot of television and radio and the like, and seeks to communicate clearly to people about the future path of interest rates.\" Some economists reckon rates will rise this year. Other suspect that, with wage growth and inflation weak, the BoE will resist hiking until 2015 -- but probably before next May's election. Osborne is also giving a speech this morning, on his vision for a new high-speed rail link between Manchester to Leeds. Full coverage in our Politics liveblog. European stock markets have fallen across the board, as investors baulk at the latest PMI surveys. The news that growth in the euro area has slowed this month sent the French and German markets down over 0.8%, with deeper losses in other market. There's no relief that China's PMI report beat forecasts (see earlier) Saxo Bank trader Andrea Tueni told Reuters: \"The market doesn't like at all the French PMIs, and the German data is also disappointing. It eclipses the upbeat Chinese data from overnight and it's a reminder that the latest ECB (stimulus) measures are not magic,\" France's ongoing economic weakness has dragged down the overall eurozone private sector, which has recorded its slowest growth since last December. Markit's 'composite' measure of activity at service and manufacturing firms across the euro area fell to 52.8. That's a six-month low, and a chunky drop in growth compared to May's 53.5. Economists had expected an unchanged reading, rather than a fall towards the 50-point mark splitting expansion from contraction. As covered earlier, France's composite PMI fell deeper into contraction, (49.3, from 48.0, while Germany's showed slower growth (54.2, from 55.6). French factories and service firms reported that activity and output fell again this month, forcing firms to cut headcount again. In the rest of the region, growth was the strongest since August 2007. Markit's Chris Williamson warned that the data suggests the eurozone recovery is \"losing momentum\", and pointed to France as the major worry: The June PMI rounded off the strongest quarter for three years, but a concern is that a second consecutive monthly fall in the index signals that the eurozone recovery is losing momentum. The big concern is once again the divergent trends within the eurozone. Although the survey suggests the eurozone as a whole should grow by at least 0.4% in the second quarter, France appears to be entering a renewed downturn after GDP stagnated in the first quarter. Germany meanwhile looks set to grow by 0.7% or more in the second quarter, albeit with signs that the upturn is starting to lose momentum again. \u201cIt is the rest of the region, outside of France and Germany, which \u2013 as a whole \u2013 is seeing the strongest growth momentum at the moment, highlighting how the\"periphery\u201f is recovering. Growth outside of France and Germany accelerated in June to round off the best quarter since the third quarter of 2007.\u201d This graph shows how the periphery (such as Spain and Italy) have strengthened, as France has weakened: So, the two-stroke engine at the heart of the eurozone continues to fire out of balance. Germany's private sector is recording steady growth again this month, while France's firms continuing to suffer falling activity. The French may not appreciate being dubbed the sick man of Europe, but there's little sign in today's data that it's turned the corner. There's little reaction in the markets -- with the euro dipping just 0.04% to $1.3594. Just in -- growth across Germany's firms slowed to an eight-month low this month, but remains rather stronger than in France (see 8.22am). Markit's overall composite output index, measuring factories and service firms, fell to 54.2 from 55.6 in May. That's the lowest reading since last October, but still shows solid growth. Manufacturing output growth inched a little higher, while services sector growth dipped a little (see chart below). Firms reported that new business continued to increase, with export orders up for the 11th month running. And firms kept hiring new staff -- another sign that Germany is benefitting from the upturn in the euro area this year. Pollyanna De Lima, Markit economist, said: \u201cThe strong performance in Germany\u2019s private sector economy seen throughout 2014 so far continued at the end of Q2, with June\u2019s data highlighting yet another robust expansion of output and new orders. There was also good news on the job front, as sustained demand growth continued to feed through to the labour market. \u201cMoreover, the economic recovery remained broad- based by sector, as robust data were registered across the manufacturing and service sectors. Additionally, goods producers reported having benefited from higher export orders from European clients.\" Firms also reported that they raised price, a little, this month -- which doesn't suggest Germany is suffering deflationary pressures (unlike weaker areas of the eurozone). Some reaction to the news that France's private sector continues to contract this month. Paul Smith, Senior Economist at Markit: \u201cThere remained little sign of any turnaround in the performance of France\u2019s economy at the end of Q2, with output falling for a second successive month and at a faster rate. The data are consistent with another disappointing GDP outturn for Q2 following stagnation in the first quarter. \u201cAlthough service providers indicated a stabilisation of new business during the month, a sharper reduction in manufacturing, new orders was especially disappointing with the data implying that demand for French produced goods from both at home and abroad was faltering. \u201cOn these trends, the economic underperformance of France seems set to persist well into H2 2014.\u201d Credit Agricole's Frederik Ducrozet: More bad news for France -- its private sector has suffered another contraction in activity, suggesting that its economic troubles continue. The latest 'flash' report from data firm Markit shows that output and activity both continued to shrink this month. The French manufacturing PMI tumbled to a six-month low of 47.8, down from 49.6 in May. That's deeper into contraction territory. And the services sector did little better, with activity hitting a a four-month low of 48.2, down from 49.1. This sent the overall flash Composite Output Index down to 48.0, from 49.3, which is a 4-month low. As Markit puts it: June\u2019s flash PMI data painted another picture of subdued economic performance in France, with output down for a second successive month, orders falling slightly and the sharpest cut in staffing levels for four months. France's economy stagnated in the first three months of this year, and recent PMI surveys don't suggest that its private sector is going to drag it forwards. Markit warned that the decline in output was \"broad-based\", with new orders and employment levels falling. It added: Manufacturers recorded the sharpest cut in new work of 2014 so far, with both demand from at home and abroad faltering. Service sector firms did a little better, with \"new business volumes unchanged following two consecutive months of contraction.\". And while service firm's business expectations rose, they remain low by historical standards. Reaction to follow... City investors aren't panicking about the ASOS fire - its shares have only fallen 2.5% in early trading. Hats off to ASOS, which has managed to get its online order system working again, barely two days after its distribution centre in Barnsley caught fire. It told the City this morning that around 20% of stock at the warehouse has been affected by the blaze, damaged either by fire or water (from the sprinkler systems). That's probably around \u00a322m worth of clothing, and Asos says it is \"fully insured\" for loss of stock and interruption to its operations. The company also reassured investors that: \"None of the technology, automation or structure of the building has been affected by the fire\". South Yorkshire Police are treating the incident as deliberate and have commenced a criminal enquiry, Asos added. It took 10 fire engine and 60 firefighters to bring the fire under control, with several floors of the warehouse affected. The upbeat Chinese factory survey pushed Japan's Nikkei index to a new five-month closing high, up 0.1% or 19 points to 15,369. Good news out of China this morning: its factory sector has returned to growth for the first time in six months. But that shouldn't deter Beijing from pushing out more stimulus measures to keep the economy rolling, according to HSBC economists. HSBC's 'flash' manufacturing PMI report, which tracks activity across thousands of small firms in China, rose to a seven-month high of 50.8 in June, up from 49.4 in May. That's the first time in 2014 that the PMI has come in above the 50-point mark that splits expansion from contraction. Encouragingly, the increase was driven by a rise in new orders, both from domestic customers and overseas. That suggests recent 'mini-stimulus' packages, including more money for infrastructure projects, are filtering through to the real economy. However, Chinese factories continued to cut staff, although at a slower rate than in May. Qu Hongbin, chief economist for China at HSBC, commented: This month's improvement is consistent with data suggesting that the authorities' mini-stimulus are filtering through to the real economy. Over the next few months, infrastructure investments and related sectors will continue to support the recovery. We expect policy makers to continue their current path of accommodative policy stance until the recovery is sustained. We expect policymakers to continue their current path of accommodative policy stance until the recovery is sustained. And Ting Lu, an economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, also predicts that Beijing will \"continue rolling out more measures to stabilize growth.\" Here's the full breakdown. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Coming up today -- new surveys showing how French and German private sector firms are faring this morning. Markit's PMI reports are expected to show that France's manufacturing and service companies continues to suffer falling activity this month, while Germany keeps growing. We'll also be tracking UK online fashion retailer ASOS, whose distribution centre in Barnsley caught fire, apparently deliberately, on Friday night. Quite remarkably, given the damage, the company started taking orders again a few hours ago. I'll be tracking all the main events through the day.",

In Britain, Lidl now actively advertises its use of local retailers with a \"We love British\" campaign. Whereas in Germany Lidl did not run TV ads until 2008, it has spent generously on a marketing campaign with a self-consciously British sense of humour. \"Traditionally, the groceries market in Britain has always been very class-based: whether you shop at Asda or Waitrose usually reveals something about your social status,\" said Queck. \"Lidl and Aldi somehow managed to break up those old hierarchies; their customers are not just those with a low income, but also people who think it's smarter not to care too much about where you're seen to do your shopping.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A few years ago, Carlos Rivera was a virtual unknown, even in the art circles where he earned his living. He was just another gallerist, running a West Hollywood outlet called Rivera &amp; Rivera, mostly putting on photography group shows. Now, however, Rivera is making waves with his ArtRank service, which makes \"buy\" or \"sell\" judgments on contemporary artists, in the same way that stockbrokers rate shares. For $3,500 a quarter, ArtRank's clients get snappy \u2013 some might say brutal \u2013 investment advice based on information such as past sales, studio output, upcoming shows and posts on Instagram and Twitter. The service, which he says uses complex algorithms developed for investment banking, is limited to 10 subscribers at a time; when Rivera threw the list open in April, there were, he says, more than 80 applications. Many artists have been appalled to find themselves on ArtRank's list, even if the verdict is favourable. One young New Yorker in the \"buy now\" column calls her inclusion \"terrifying\". \"People should spend less time worrying about art prices and more about world politics,\" she said. One can only imagine how Walead Beshty and Mark Flood are feeling, given they are all rated \"sell now\". This doesn't necessarily mean prices are expected to fall, just that rises may be running out of steam. As for this year's art darling, the Colombian Oscar Murillo, he gets the even more damning \"liquidate\", alongside Jacob Kassay, Lucien Smith, Sterling Ruby and Parker Ito, all of whom have experienced massive spikes in their prices. When ArtRank appeared earlier this year, many thought it was an in-joke or a cruel commentary on the art world, especially since it was originally called sellyoulater.com. Now it's seen as further evidence that art and finance are converging, stoking anxiety that speculators (or \"flippers\") are in control of the market. It's one thing to buy and sell huge holdings in the likes of Andy Warhol or Jean-Michel Basquiat, critics say, quite another to gamble with those whose careers have barely begun. Art reputations take years to develop and moments to ruin; consume the young and you consume the future. Flipping art has \"definitely become some kind of a financial sport,\" mega-collector Mera Rubell lamented earlier this year. \"It's painful to see.\" Since February, when Bloomberg published a report about collectors bulk-buying emerging artists with the goal of quickly reselling at a profit, there's been talk of an art bubble. Work by artists born after 1945 generated $17.2bn in auction sales last year, up 39% from 2012. The recent contemporary auctions in New York, meanwhile, generated more than $1bn in sales, leaving even informed market players scratching their heads. \"I don't know what money means any more,\" said Asher Edelman, founder of art financing company ArtAssure. \"I'm not endorsing speculation,\" Rivera insists. Still, fears that the market is out of control are unlikely to be calmed by his claim that his previous venture, a fund investing in both emerging and established artists, grew from $700,000 in 2011 to $12 million in 2013, partly by buying into the likes of Robert Rauschenberg and Cy Twombly. Only too happy to put his side of the story, ArtRank's 26-year-old founder pulls up at Hollywood's 101 diner on a Ducati. He's been driving fast through rush-hour traffic. Exhilarating, no doubt \u2013 but, like investing in art, a gamble. Rivera, who was born in Argentina and studied technology at university, says his site is a legitimate, data-driven advisory service. \"It's difficult to get an objective perspective,\" he says. \"That, as much as possible, is what I hope to do with ArtRank \u2013 add a level of transparency.\" Rivera got into the art business after the financial upheavals of 2007-08, when wealthy people were parking money in art rather than risking it, say, on office developments in Beijing. \"Historically, art does well coming out of recession,\" he reasoned. \"It's S-W-A-G, right? Silver. Wine. Art. Gold.\" As the market expanded, it became obvious to him that collectors lacked the data to make informed investment decisions. \"Just because an artist's work has gone from $400,000 to $450,000 to $500,000, to then assume it'll go to $550,000 would be unintelligible to financial markets,\" he says. With contemporary art focused on a handful of star names, he says, ArtRank is simply an effort to quantify what the market's players do all day anyway \u2013 which is talk, often about money. \"What do you think a gallerist does?\" he says, stripping off his biker jacket. \"I should know \u2013 I've run a gallery. There's nothing to do except gossip.\" He also believes the art market cannot sustain its current rate of growth without broadening the base of collectors. The obvious place to look is the new class of super-rich technocrats, people who made their fortunes in data-crunching and want art, or their understanding of it, to conform to that view \u2013 not as a proposition fashioned by self-styled elites in New York and London. Further down the ladder, young collectors who may want to enter the market feel shut out. \"People don't know about emerging-market artists without a great adviser, and you don't get a great adviser unless you've got millions of dollars to spend. I'm not asking for $50,000 upfront like a top art adviser.\" All that ArtRank's subscribers get for their $3,500 a quarter is a three-week head start before Rivera makes the ratings publicly available on its website; nonetheless, one US collector, LA-based Rolando Jimenez, describes it as \"an essential tool if you want to evaluate your emerging art-collecting ventures as a serious investment\". According to Rivera, the film producer Stefan Simchowitz was so impressed by ArtRank that he tried to buy a stake in it. An unabashed art flipper, Simchowitz famously invested $50,000 in 34 Murillos early in the artist's career, selling one last September for $401,000. Rivera says he understands why artists are angry about being gambled on, but he insists everyone is culpable: collectors for flipping the work; galleries for forcing collectors to buy lesser work in addition to pieces they really want; artists themselves for churning out work made by teams of assistants. With dealers wanting new work from new artists to meet demand from new collectors at new and ever-expanding art fairs (90% of art at Frieze New York sold in the first two days), there's no time to waste. \"The more contemporary art is seen as an instrument for investment, the riskier it becomes,\" warns Kathryn Graddy, a professor of art market economics at Brandeis University in Massachusetts. The market is demanding more art, she says, \"but it is one thing to encourage art, another to organise a market because the thinking is everybody will want the same hyped artists.\" ArtRank isn't the first service to offer market insight (the pricing database Artnet Worldwide springs to mind, alongside ArtTactic, the market trends firm that recently estimated the art market is controlled by 150 people with resources to spend $20m on a single work of art); it's just the first to rank artists as starkly as a stock-pick. But perhaps its arrival was inevitable. Many people will tell you that the 10-year boom in contemporary art has created a market that behaves like an unregulated stock market. Rumour has it that some collectors, like angel investors in tech start-ups, are placing artists on retainers and paying a bonus for works completed. At the same time, some artists are protesting about the system they're being exposed to. At Christie's last month, Untitled (Fire, Red/Black U), an inkjet piece by the New Yorker Wade Guyton, fetched $3.5m. Guyton's response was to print off multiple copies of the image from his original disk and post photos of them on Instagram. Others are musing remedies ranging from refusing to produce commercial work, to joining collectives, or showing work in mobile exhibitions unconnected to the art establishment. It may be no more than a gesture, but it speaks of an honest search for meaning in a business that has lost its cultural cool. Rivera sees the trends \u2013 the chewing-gum colours, the canvases with their stretcher bars exposed, the souvenirs from performance art \u2013 and wonders about originality. \"Sometimes it's kind of a joke,\" he admits and offers some age-old advice: buy what you really like. \"If you made a $150,000 bonus last year, but know nothing about the art market, don't go to Sotheby's or Phillips to bid $50,000 on a Parker Ito you know nothing about. The only person who benefits from that is the speculator who bought it for $3,000.\" Instead, he suggests, \"go on ArtRank and find five artists under $10,000. If you spend $6,000 on a work at a gallery, the artist and the gallery each get half.\" Pulling out the keys to the Ducati, he adds: \"The concern is that we're ranking people \u2013 but we all rank people anyway. Look at the Oscars. Look at athletes. Artists can grow and outperform, too. We're just a gauge of their abilities.\"",

The service, which he says uses complex algorithms developed for investment banking, is limited to 10 subscribers at a time; when Rivera threw the list open in April, there were, he says, more than 80 applications.</p> <p>Many artists have been appalled to find themselves on ArtRank's list, even if the verdict is favourable. One young New Yorker in the \"buy now\" column calls her inclusion \"terrifying\". \"People should spend less time worrying about art prices and more about world politics,\" she said.</p> <p>One can only imagine how Walead Beshty and Mark Flood are feeling, given they are all rated \"sell now\". This doesn't necessarily mean prices are expected to fall, just that rises may be running out of steam. As for this year's art darling, the Colombian Oscar Murillo, he gets the even more damning \"liquidate\", alongside Jacob Kassay, Lucien Smith, Sterling Ruby and Parker Ito, all of whom have experienced massive spikes in their prices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-440035968\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/20/1403286328733/Oscar-Murillo-ranked-liqu-011.jpg\" alt=\"Oscar Murillo ranked liquidate by ArtRank\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dark Americano by Oscar Murillo on show in London, one of the artists ArtRank recommends investors 'liquidate' as overpriced. Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When ArtRank appeared earlier this year, many thought it was an in-joke or a cruel commentary on the art world, especially since it was originally called sellyoulater.com. Now it's seen as further evidence that art and finance are converging, stoking anxiety that speculators (or \"flippers\") are in control of the market. It's one thing to buy and sell huge holdings in the likes of Andy Warhol or Jean-Michel Basquiat, critics say, quite another to gamble with those whose careers have barely begun. Art reputations take years to develop and moments to ruin; consume the young and you consume the future.</p> <p>Flipping art has \"definitely become some kind of a financial sport,\" mega-collector Mera Rubell lamented earlier this year. \"It's painful to see.\" Since February, when Bloomberg published <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-06/art-flippers-chase-fresh-stars-as-murillo-s-doodles-soar.html\" title=\"\">a report about collectors</a> bulk-buying emerging artists with the goal of quickly reselling at a profit, there's been talk of an art bubble. Work by artists born after 1945 generated $17.2bn in auction sales last year, up 39% from 2012. The recent contemporary auctions in New York, meanwhile, generated more than $1bn in sales, leaving even informed market players scratching their heads. \"I don't know what money means any more,\" said Asher Edelman, founder of art financing company ArtAssure.</p> <p>\"I'm not endorsing speculation,\" Rivera insists. Still, fears that the market is out of control are unlikely to be calmed by his claim that his previous venture, a fund investing in both emerging and established artists, grew from $700,000 in 2011 to $12 million in 2013, partly by buying into the likes of Robert Rauschenberg and Cy Twombly. Only too happy to put his side of the story, ArtRank's 26-year-old founder pulls up at Hollywood's 101 diner on a Ducati. He's been driving fast through rush-hour traffic. Exhilarating, no doubt \u2013 but, like investing in art, a gamble.</p> <p>Rivera, who was born in Argentina and studied technology at university, says his site is a legitimate, data-driven advisory service. \"It's difficult to get an objective perspective,\" he says. \"That, as much as possible, is what I hope to do with ArtRank \u2013 add a level of transparency.\"</p> <p>Rivera got into the art business after the financial upheavals of 2007-08, when wealthy people were parking money in art rather than risking it, say, on office developments in Beijing. \"Historically, art does well coming out of recession,\" he reasoned. \"It's S-W-A-G, right? Silver. Wine. Art. Gold.\" <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-12/global-art-market-surged-to-66-billion-in-2013-report.html\" title=\"\">As the market expanded</a>, it became obvious to him that collectors lacked the data to make informed investment decisions. \"Just because an artist's work has gone from $400,000 to $450,000 to $500,000, to then assume it'll go to $550,000 would be unintelligible to financial markets,\" he says.</p> <p>With contemporary art focused on a handful of star names, he says, ArtRank is simply an effort to quantify what the market's players do all day anyway \u2013 which is talk, often about money. \"What do you think a gallerist does?\" he says, stripping off his biker jacket. \"I should know \u2013 I've run a gallery. There's nothing to do except gossip.\"</p> <p>He also believes the art market cannot sustain its current rate of growth without broadening the base of collectors. The obvious place to look is the new class of super-rich technocrats, people who made their fortunes in data-crunching and want art, or their understanding of it, to conform to that view \u2013 not as a proposition fashioned by self-styled elites in New York and London.</p> <p>Further down the ladder, young collectors who may want to enter the market feel shut out. \"People don't know about emerging-market artists without a great adviser, and you don't get a great adviser unless you've got millions of dollars to spend. I'm not asking for $50,000 upfront like a top art adviser.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-440035966\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/20/1403285499258/ArtRank-artists-investor--001.jpg\" alt=\"ArtRank artists investor advice\" width=\"460\" height=\"193\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A snapshot of ArtRank's investment advice, financially rating artists for collectors. Photograph: Internet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All that ArtRank's subscribers get for their $3,500 a quarter is a three-week head start before Rivera makes the ratings publicly available on its website; nonetheless, one US collector, LA-based Rolando Jimenez, describes it as \"an essential tool if you want to evaluate your emerging art-collecting ventures as a serious investment\". According to Rivera, the film producer <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/03/saltz-on-the-great-and-powerful-simchowitz.html\" title=\"\">Stefan Simchowitz</a> was so impressed by ArtRank that he tried to buy a stake in it. An unabashed art flipper, Simchowitz famously invested $50,000 in 34 Murillos early in the artist's career, selling one last September for $401,000.</p> <p>Rivera says he understands why artists are angry about being gambled on, but he insists everyone is culpable: collectors for flipping the work; galleries for forcing collectors to buy lesser work in addition to pieces they really want; artists themselves for churning out work made by teams of assistants. With dealers wanting new work from new artists to meet demand from new collectors at new and ever-expanding art fairs (90% of art at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/frieze-new-york\" title=\"\">Frieze New York</a> sold in the first two days), there's no time to waste.</p> <p>\"The more contemporary art is seen as an instrument for investment, the riskier it becomes,\" warns Kathryn Graddy, a professor of art market economics at Brandeis University in Massachusetts. The market is demanding more art, she says, \"but it is one thing to encourage art, another to organise a market because the thinking is everybody will want the same hyped artists.\"</p> <p>ArtRank isn't the first service to offer market insight (the pricing database Artnet Worldwide springs to mind, alongside ArtTactic, the market trends firm that recently estimated the art market is controlled by 150 people with resources to spend $20m on a single work of art); it's just the first to rank artists as starkly as a stock-pick. But perhaps its arrival was inevitable. Many people will tell you that the 10-year boom in contemporary art has created a market that behaves like an unregulated stock market. Rumour has it that some collectors, like angel investors in tech start-ups, are placing artists on retainers and paying a bonus for works completed.</p> <p>At the same time, some artists are protesting about the system they're being exposed to. At Christie's last month, Untitled (Fire, Red/Black U), an inkjet piece by the New Yorker Wade Guyton, fetched $3.5m. <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/05/wade-guyton-may-be-torpedoing-his-own-sales.html\" title=\"\">Guyton's response</a> was to print off multiple copies of the image from his original disk and post photos of them on Instagram. Others are musing remedies ranging from refusing to produce commercial work, to joining collectives, or showing work in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/arts/design/just-like-taco-trucks-art-takes-to-the-road.html\" title=\"\">mobile exhibitions</a> unconnected to the art establishment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-440035967\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/20/1403285966880/Carlos-Rivera-011.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Rivera\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlos Rivera, founder of ArtRank. Photograph: Gideon Ponte</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It may be no more than a gesture, but it speaks of an honest search for meaning in a business that has lost its cultural cool. Rivera sees the trends \u2013 the chewing-gum colours, the canvases with their stretcher bars exposed, the souvenirs from performance art \u2013 and wonders about originality. \"Sometimes it's kind of a joke,\" he admits and offers some age-old advice: buy what you really like. \"If you made a $150,000 bonus last year, but know nothing about the art market, don't go to Sotheby's or Phillips to bid $50,000 on a Parker Ito you know nothing about. The only person who benefits from that is the speculator who bought it for $3,000.\" Instead, he suggests, \"go on ArtRank and find five artists under $10,000. If you spend $6,000 on a work at a gallery, the artist and the gallery each get half.\"</p> <p>Pulling out the keys to the Ducati, he adds: \"The concern is that we're ranking people \u2013 but we all rank people anyway. Look at the Oscars. Look at athletes. Artists can grow and outperform, too. We're just a gauge of their abilities.\"</p>",

The company estimated the effects of the fire and the sprinkler system at the site in Barnsley had damaged about 20% of the stock held there.

The fire comes at a difficult time for Asos which has fallen from stock market grace after issuing two profit alerts in the past six months. The second, less than three weeks ago, warned annual profits would be less than expected due to a perfect storm caused by the strengthening pound and heavy discounting. That statement wiped almost a third off the company's stock market value and short sellers, who try to cash in on a fall in a company's share price, are now thought to be targeting Asos.
