      "bodyText": "'This doesn't look good, Mr Tucker,\" said committee chairman Andrew Tyrie half way through proceedings. Indeed it didn't. The deputy governor of the Bank of England had just confessed that it came as news to him only a few weeks ago that the Libor market was a \"cesspit\" of dishonesty. This was despite discussions taking place within the Bank in November 2007 that Libor readings might not be all they seemed. Tucker sounded unworldly. \"We thought it was a malfunctioning market, not a dishonest market,\" he argued. Banks exploiting loopholes to suit their own ends? The notion such wickedness could happen seemed not to have crossed his mind. But first things first. The wholly solid part of Tucker's testimony was his account of his telephone call to Bob Diamond on 29 October 2008. The deputy governor said he was warning the Barclays chief executive that paying high rates for funding risked driving the bank \"over a cliff\", which is what had happened to Northern Rock. Don't make yourself appear desperate, the deputy governor had advised: in other words, make sure the frontline staff in Barclays' Treasury department don't pay such high rates that the market loses confidence. That, Tucker maintained firmly and fairly, is very different from issuing an invitation to Barclays to lie about the rates at which it was borrowing. Tucker said he didn't do that, and nor did any official in the Labour government at the time. In other words, the misunderstanding arose entirely within Barclays. Fair enough: on that score, Tucker is vindicated. George Osborne, when (if?) he makes his apologies, ought to include Tucker on his list. It was a serious error of judgment for the chancellor to take potshots at former Labour ministers on the basis of Diamond's sloppily worded memo. Ed Balls and Baroness Vadera have also been vindicated and Osborne should have had the decency to hear Tucker's version of events. It should have occurred to the chancellor that it would be natural and proper for the government of the time to be interested in why Barclays was paying relatively high rates for money. As Tucker explained, the government had just bailed out RBS and Lloyds/HBOS while giving Barclays permission to raise funds itself. It had also put in place emergency measures to help all UK banks. Thus the government needed to know if its efforts were working and whether there was a risk that Barclays could be the next domino to fall. The Treasury would inevitably be interested in the signals from the market. There's nothing wrong with that. When the political storm has passed, however, attention will return to the setting of Libor rates in the critical 2007-08 period. This key financial indicator was the basis on which millions of contracts were being written. Yet the regulators seem to have been aware that it wasn't a reliable guide to the rate at which banks lend to each other, which is what Libor purports to be. Tucker said repeatedly that Libor was being set in \"dysfunctional and sporadically illiquid markets\". Less money was being raised via brokers, where rates would be visible, and more was being raised via direct bank-to-bank arrangement, where visibility is reduced. That explanation is coherent but doesn't explain why the regulators were so relaxed about Libor. They should have spotted that the back door had been left wide open for banks to manipulate their submissions. Tucker variously argued that Libor wasn't the Bank's direct responsibility (it was the British Bankers Association's) and that the midst of a crisis, when the financial system is in meltdown, is not the best time to attempt an overhaul. Okay, but we now know there was a \"cesspit\" at the heart of the financial system. When you're the man at the Bank who is supposed to be in touch with day-to-day activity in markets, that revelation is serious. A reputation for innocence is not the best basis from which to seek promotion to the post of governor.",

      "body": "<p>For almost 1,000 years, the City of London Corporation has resisted virtually every attempt by monarchs, governments or the people to rein in its vast wealth and influence. From the murder of peasant revolt leader Wat Tyler by the lord mayor of London and his men in 1381, to the dispatching from the City to Northern Ireland of rural refugees forced off their land in 17th-century land reforms, the corporation has long been a guiding hand in British history. </p> <p>Today, the corporation's main weapon is sophisticated, well-resourced and hospitable diplomacy.

      "bodyText": "For almost 1,000 years, the City of London Corporation has resisted virtually every attempt by monarchs, governments or the people to rein in its vast wealth and influence. From the murder of peasant revolt leader Wat Tyler by the lord mayor of London and his men in 1381, to the dispatching from the City to Northern Ireland of rural refugees forced off their land in 17th-century land reforms, the corporation has long been a guiding hand in British history. Today, the corporation's main weapon is sophisticated, well-resourced and hospitable diplomacy. But its main aim, charitable endeavours and duties such as the Square Mile's local authority notwithstanding, is the same as it ever was: retaining London's status as a premier-league financial centre. The human bridgehead in this task is its new \"lobbyist-in-chief\", Mark Boleat, appointed in May as chairman of the pivotal corporation policy and resources committee. Behind Boleat sit parliamentary lawyers, public affairs staff, 43 media staff, a 50-strong economic development unit sifting through international regulations, researchers and legions of hospitality workers. This public affairs machine costs over \u00a310m, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism's calculations, although the corporation disputes this figure. Boleat is the corporation's de facto prime minister, and will, if he is anything like Stuart Fraser \u2013 his recent predecessor \u2013 be like a moth to the flame of power. Until his departure, Fraser was probably the City's most energetic lobbyist.

But since the summit, eurozone creditor governments have backtracked on the pledges over how the accord will be implemented.</p> <p>While the Germans and other north Europeans insist that direct bank injections can be contemplated only once a new regime of banking supervision is in place (likely to take a year), senior Eurogroup officials signalled that even in the event of bailout funds going straight to banks, the host country would still be burdened. If the main bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, took equity in troubled banks, the host government would need to underwrite the risk and be liable if the bank went bust, the officials said.</p> <p>\"The ESM is able to take an equity share in a bank, but only against full sovereign guarantees. It remains the risk of the sovereign. There's some degree of mystification going on here,\" said a senior official.</p> <p>That was contradicted by the European commission, which stressed there would be no liability for the host state if its banks were rescued.</p> <p>With the troika of the commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund scrutinising the performance of Greece, Cyprus and Spain, the senior official added that it would be the end of August before any decisions were taken on Greece and Cyprus.</p> <p>Spain was expected to dominate Monday night's session, the quandary made more urgent as the yield on Madrid's benchmark 10-year bonds nudged 7.2%, past the point of the affordable.</p> <p>The ministers were to try to reach a \"political understanding\" on a memorandum between the eurozone and Madrid to be finalised later this month. In Brussels there is talk of emergency Eurogroup talks around 20 July or an extraordinary summit. Ministers could also confer by videoconference before the August holiday.</p> <p>In what appeared to be a reference to Spain, Draghi said last week that bailout funds to banks would burden the host country only temporarily since the money would come off the books once the new banking supervisory regime was in place. Eurogroup officials, however, cast doubt on whether Spain would benefit, pointing out that the memorandum of understanding with Madrid was likely to extend only until 2014 and it could take that long for the new procedures to be implemented.</p> <p>On Greece, the officials said \"there would be no more disbursement\" of eurozone bailout funds until the current troika mission was complete and had assessed how far Athens' austerity and structural reform programmes had been blown off track by the political turbulence of the last three months.</p>",

The Spanish banking rescue was the main issue confronting ministers on Monday, but there were mixed signals over who would be liable for the mooted direct recapitalisation of the country's financial sector. The summit resolved to break the invidious link between failing banks and weak sovereigns by agreeing to use eurozone bailout funds to recapitalise banks directly, not via governments, to avoid pushing up debt levels. But since the summit, eurozone creditor governments have backtracked on the pledges over how the accord will be implemented. While the Germans and other north Europeans insist that direct bank injections can be contemplated only once a new regime of banking supervision is in place (likely to take a year), senior Eurogroup officials signalled that even in the event of bailout funds going straight to banks, the host country would still be burdened. If the main bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, took equity in troubled banks, the host government would need to underwrite the risk and be liable if the bank went bust, the officials said. \"The ESM is able to take an equity share in a bank, but only against full sovereign guarantees. It remains the risk of the sovereign. There's some degree of mystification going on here,\" said a senior official. That was contradicted by the European commission, which stressed there would be no liability for the host state if its banks were rescued. With the troika of the commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund scrutinising the performance of Greece, Cyprus and Spain, the senior official added that it would be the end of August before any decisions were taken on Greece and Cyprus. Spain was expected to dominate Monday night's session, the quandary made more urgent as the yield on Madrid's benchmark 10-year bonds nudged 7.2%, past the point of the affordable. The ministers were to try to reach a \"political understanding\" on a memorandum between the eurozone and Madrid to be finalised later this month. In Brussels there is talk of emergency Eurogroup talks around 20 July or an extraordinary summit. Ministers could also confer by videoconference before the August holiday. In what appeared to be a reference to Spain, Draghi said last week that bailout funds to banks would burden the host country only temporarily since the money would come off the books once the new banking supervisory regime was in place. Eurogroup officials, however, cast doubt on whether Spain would benefit, pointing out that the memorandum of understanding with Madrid was likely to extend only until 2014 and it could take that long for the new procedures to be implemented. On Greece, the officials said \"there would be no more disbursement\" of eurozone bailout funds until the current troika mission was complete and had assessed how far Athens' austerity and structural reform programmes had been blown off track by the political turbulence of the last three months.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Boeing has announced a $7.2bn (\u00a34.6bn) order for its next-generation shorthaul jet, the 737 Max, in its drive to trump Airbus in the commercial aircraft market this year. The deal was unveiled at the Farnborough air show, where the aerospace industry's importance to the UK economy is being underlined by a wave of ministerial visits \u2013 led by David Cameron on Monday morning. Opening the show, Cameron said aerospace was a \"real success story\" and \"a vitally important industry in the UK and for the future of our country and our economy\". The UK accounts for around 15% of Airbus's commercial aircraft production but it was US-based Boeing that took first advantage at Farnborough with an order from Air Lease Corporation (ALC), run by jet-leasing entrepreneur Steven Udvar-Hazy. ALC has placed a firm order for 75 737 Max planes, the revamped and more fuel-efficient version of a jet widely used by the likes of Ryanair, with rights to buy 25 more \u2014 bringing the potential value to more than $7bn. The announcement takes the number of firm orders for the 737 Max to 539, still some distance behind Airbus and its A320neo, a re-jigged version of its A320 shorthaul workhorse, which has more than 1,300 orders. Asked when the 737 Max will overtake its rival, the new head of Boeing's commercial division, Ray Conner, said: \"We are just going to keep plugging away and see where we end up.\" Udvar-Hazy is a pioneer of the aircraft leasing trade, where airlines rent jets rather than acquire them. It allows carriers to obtain aircraft without paying for them up front and gives airlines the flexibility to hand aircraft back after five to six years if business dips, or keep them on if demand remains strong. Udvar-Hazy said the 737 Max \"meets the needs\" of a modern airline by being up to 13% cheaper to operate than its precursor. Fuel accounts for around a third of airline operating costs, double the proportion a decade ago, and the 737 Max and A320 neo have been well received by carriers striving to stay profitable amid high fuel prices and weak demand. The deal represents a turnround for Boeing in the wake of comments by Udvar-Hazy at the start of the year, when he expressed doubts about the revamped 737. However, the billionaire ALC chief executive said Boeing had since come back with a \"really refined design\" including tweaks to the aircraft's fuselage and tail sections to make it more fuel-efficient. Despite the A320neo's long lead, Boeing expects to edge Airbus in total commercial aircraft orders this year. Last year saw Airbus book a record number of net orders, for 1,419 aircraft compared with Boeing's 805. However, following that initial flurry of 320neo orders, Boeing is expected to ensure a closer finish in 2012. Another 737 Max order is reportedly imminent from a further aircraft leasing company, Kuwait-based Aviation Lease &amp; Finance, while US carrier United-Continental is also a mooted buyer. The ALC firm orders are comprised of 60 for the 737 Max-8 and 15 for the 737 Max-9 variant, which can cover longer distances.",

      "body": "<p>Boeing has announced a $7.2bn (\u00a34.6bn) order for its next-generation shorthaul jet, the 737 Max, in its drive to trump Airbus in the commercial aircraft market this year.</p> <p>The deal was unveiled at the Farnborough air show, where the aerospace industry's importance to the UK economy is being underlined by a wave of ministerial visits \u2013 led by David Cameron on Monday morning. Opening the show, Cameron said aerospace was a \"real success story\" and \"a vitally important industry in the UK and for the future of our country and our economy\".</p> <p>The UK accounts for around 15% of Airbus's commercial aircraft production but it was US-based Boeing that took first advantage at Farnborough with an order from Air Lease Corporation (ALC), run by jet-leasing entrepreneur Steven Udvar-Hazy. ALC has placed a firm order for 75 737 Max planes, the revamped and more fuel-efficient version of a jet widely used by the likes of Ryanair, with rights to buy 25 more \u2014 bringing the potential value to more than $7bn.</p> <p>The announcement takes the number of firm orders for the 737 Max to 539, still some distance behind Airbus and its A320neo, a re-jigged version of its A320 shorthaul workhorse, which has more than 1,300 orders. Asked when the 737 Max will overtake its rival, the new head of Boeing's commercial division, Ray Conner, said: \"We are just going to keep plugging away and see where we end up.\"</p> <p>Udvar-Hazy is a pioneer of the aircraft leasing trade, where airlines rent jets rather than acquire them. It allows carriers to obtain aircraft without paying for them up front and gives airlines the flexibility to hand aircraft back after five to six years if business dips, or keep them on if demand remains strong.<br>Udvar-Hazy said the 737 Max \"meets the needs\" of a modern airline by being up to 13% cheaper to operate than its precursor. </p> <p>Fuel accounts for around a third of airline operating costs, double the proportion a decade ago, and the 737 Max and A320 neo have been well received by carriers striving to stay profitable amid high fuel prices and weak demand.</p> <p>The deal represents a turnround for Boeing in the wake of comments by Udvar-Hazy at the start of the year, when he expressed doubts about the revamped 737. However, the billionaire ALC chief executive said Boeing had since come back with a \"really refined design\" including tweaks to the aircraft's fuselage and tail sections to make it more fuel-efficient.</p> <p>Despite the A320neo's long lead, Boeing expects to edge Airbus in total commercial aircraft orders this year. Last year saw Airbus book a record number of net orders, for 1,419 aircraft compared with Boeing's 805.<br>However, following that initial flurry of 320neo orders, Boeing is expected to ensure a closer finish in 2012. Another 737 Max order is reportedly imminent from a further aircraft leasing company, Kuwait-based Aviation Lease &amp; Finance, while US carrier United-Continental is also a mooted buyer. The ALC firm orders are comprised of 60 for the 737 Max-8 and 15 for the 737 Max-9 variant, which can cover longer distances.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Passport queues at Heathrow have been \"unacceptably long\" during peak periods in the last few days, the airport operator has told Home Office ministers. \"The Home Office should be delivering a good experience for regular passengers as well as Olympic visitors,\" said BAA on Monday. Its official complaint followed a snap 7am visit to Heathrow on Monday by Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs committee. He said he was appalled to discover immigration queues of more than an hour for non-EU passengers at Terminal 4 and that half the passport desks were closed. Travellers face further problems getting into London after they have made it through passport control as the M4 motorway is closed until Thursday to repair cracks in a viaduct. Vaz's claims of fresh delays triggered a row with the Home Office and BAA, which insisted that the passport desks were properly staffed and the longest queue was less than an hour. Official BAA figures put the longest wait for non-EU passport holders at Heathrow at 56 minutes. A Border Force spokesperson said: \"Keith Vaz is incorrect. Queues at Terminal 4 remained under an hour at all times. Staff were quickly redeployed and more than 80% of desks were open to process passengers as quickly as possible.\" The row followed the disclosure of internal BAA papers showing that the 45-minute target for non-EU passengers was repeatedly missed during June, with the longest wait at two hours, one minute. Vaz tweeted from Heathrow: \"Just left T4. Appalled by immigration queues. People stacked in corridors. #airportqueues #olympics #immigration\". He later said: \"It is now two months since the immigration minister promised additional resources and better management. The worst aspect was that half of the immigration desks were simply not opened, even though the Border Force had prior knowledge of all flight arrivals. This creates additional security pressures with luggage piling up in the baggage hall.\" Vaz added that he would raise the problem with the immigration minister, Damian Green, when the latter gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee on Tuesday. Further pressure on the UK Border Force to quickly sort the problem is expected when the immigration inspector, John Vine, publishes a his report on Heathrow on Thursday. BAA said: \"Immigration waiting times for passengers during peak periods at Heathrow in the last few days have been unacceptably long and the Home Office should be delivering a good experience for regular passengers as well as for Olympic visitors.\" The statement added: \"Immigration is a matter for the Home Office. The Home Office has said that from 15 July all Border Force desks at Heathrow will be open during peak Olympic arrival periods.\" The immigration minister said a full reading of BAA's latest statistics showed its actions to tackle queues have resulted in improvements over the last two months. This included consistently hitting targets on UK and EU passengers and reducing waiting times across the board, said Green. \"But we're not complacent about some long waiting times, which is why this weekend we have increased staffing numbers by more than 50 per cent at Heathrow to respond to large passengers volumes. That has seen average waiting times of around six minutes for EEA passengers and 22 minutes for those from outside Europe,\" he said. \"And by the start of peak Olympic arrivals in less than 10 days there will be up to 500 additional staff on our rotas across the country \u2013 this includes enough staff at Heathrow to cover every desk during busy times. Additionally we have special lanes in place designated to Olympic athletes to enable them to pass through the border without delay.\"",

Betfair said Cyprus contributed around 4% of group revenues last year, and around \u00a39m of profit. Its shares have lost 34p to 722p on the news, but it is taking advice on the legality of the move. It said:</p> <blockquote> The company believes the legislation contains serious flaws and, in certain areas, is inconsistent with European Union law. <br> Betfair...will be taking all necessary steps to reduce the impact on profitability through both legal action and cost management. </blockquote> <p>Analyst Michael Campbell at broker Daniel Stewart said he believed Cyprus also planned to introduce a new betting tax of 13% of gross profits.</p> <blockquote> This is another blow to Betfair's exchange betting business.

      "bodyText": "Betfair shares have dropped around 4.5% after Cyprus introduced regulation to restrict online gambling. The beleaguered eurozone state said it would restrict online casino and poker as well as exchange betting. Betfair said Cyprus contributed around 4% of group revenues last year, and around \u00a39m of profit. Its shares have lost 34p to 722p on the news, but it is taking advice on the legality of the move. It said: The company believes the legislation contains serious flaws and, in certain areas, is inconsistent with European Union law. Betfair...will be taking all necessary steps to reduce the impact on profitability through both legal action and cost management. Analyst Michael Campbell at broker Daniel Stewart said he believed Cyprus also planned to introduce a new betting tax of 13% of gross profits. This is another blow to Betfair's exchange betting business.
