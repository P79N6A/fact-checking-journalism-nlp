    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The shambolic state of the Co-operative Group was laid bare in a scathing verdict warning that the survival of Britain's biggest mutual organisation was at stake. The Co-op has been undermined by \"reckless\" dealmaking, \"shocking\" levels of debt and governance standards far worse than even the banks before the credit crunch, according to Lord Myners, the group's senior independent director who was charged with overhauling the boardroom. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, the City grandee who was installed as a Labour minister at the height of the credit crisis said: \"I have observed the bad governance of the banks, but this is on an altogether worse level. \"The rate of deterioration has increased over the last half dozen years because of the recklessness of the strategy being pursued and supported by the board.\" He added that the entire retail, funeral home, pharmacy and farming conglomerate would deteriorate further unless it was radically reformed. Myners, also an ex-chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer and Guardian Media Group, said the Co-op's reputation as a business run democratically by its members was a myth. He said the company's most senior managers were left to waste billions of pounds on disastrous corporate transactions because the directors drawn from the Co-op movement were not qualified to keep them in check. \"Few of them have any serious business experience and many are drawing material financial benefits from their positions.\" Myners said the Co-op's elected directors \u2013 who include a plasterer, lecturer, tax official, nurse and farmer \u2013 had overseen \"breathtakingly value-destructive\" deals, including the takeover of the Somerfield supermarket chain and the Britannia building society. It was the Britannia deal that left the Co-op bank facing a \u00a31.5bn financial black hole and resulted in the bank being taken over by US hedge funds. Myners, called in to review the group's governance in December, proposed far-reaching changes that he said would ensure it could stay true to the Co-op's democratic ideals and still be run on commercial lines. In a report rushed out \u2013 just days after the group's chief executive, Euan Sutherland, quit and branded the organisation \"ungovernable\" \u2013 Myners concluded that: \u2022 The group's \"massive failure of governance\" had \"gravely damaged the organisation\", letting its business decay and leaving it financially weak. \u2022 Its members, who supposedly own the business, have almost no say in what the board or managers decide. \u2022 Unless the governance is reformed \"it will run out of capital to support its business\". Myners said it was a tragedy that Sutherland had quit because the Co-op owed its survival through last year's bank crisis to him and his team. He said what he had uncovered at the Co-op was so serious that the group had no choice but to change. \"What I think I have exposed is that the Co-op is not a democratic organisation and has a deeply flawed governance structure, and if it doesn't address these issues the pace of decline will simply increase. The reality is that the Co-op has been in decline for 60 years.\" The organisation had \"the worst governance I have ever witnessed\" and \"shocking\" levels of debt, some of which was hidden by complex property deals, he said. The group currently has debts of \u00a31.2bn. \"This is folly in the extreme. This really pains me.\" He said that the group, led by \u00a31.2m-a-year chief executive Peter Marks until last year, had been obsessed with making large acquisitions instead of competing in the cut-throat world of grocery retailing, which is its main business. The crisis at the Co-op came to a head last week when Sutherland resigned, after just 10 months, when the Observer revealed his \u00a33.6m pay package. Sutherland said that senior colleagues were determined to undermine him and he blamed them for a series of damaging leaks. Myners claimed Sutherland never intended to take the \u00a32m of bonuses awarded on top of his \u00a31.5m salary. The money was agreed before Myners became involved and, he said, should have been revealed earlier. Britain's biggest mutual company was plunged into chaos last May when a \u00a31.5bn financial hole was revealed at its banking arm. The capital shortage had forced the Co-op to abandon its bid for more than 600 Lloyds bank branches and has led to US hedge funds owning most of the bank. The problems deepened in November when the bank's former chairman, Paul Flowers, was alleged to have bought class A drugs and used rent boys. Myners said the Co-op had lost almost all the customers it picked up when it bought Somerfield in 2008 for \u00a31.6bn. He said taking over the Britannia had almost bankrupted the Co-op bank and the attempted Lloyds deal, codenamed Project Verde, was misconceived: \"Somerfield was reckless. Britannia was reckless. Verde was reckless.\" Myners said he had worked four days a week for three months examining the group's \"labyrinthine\" structures and coming up with proposals. He will be paid \u00a31 for his efforts. The Flowers affair triggered a string of inquiries into the turmoil at the group, whose ethics and democratic structure had been lauded as an alternative to the big bonuses and ruthless business practices of City-controlled companies. Myners said his proposals would make the group more democratic by involving its currently- ignored wider membership while making sure people with business experience were in charge of commercial decisions. He faces opposition from within the group's senior ranks who accused Sutherland of trying to scrap the values established by the Rochdale pioneers who founded the group in 1844. But Myners argued even his most entrenched opponents now realised the status quo could not stand. Myners said the group's directors had been paid hundreds of thousands of pounds in the last few years as the group was driven close to ruin. \"It depresses me. It's a controlled anger,\" he said. He rejected claims he had alienated board members with his uncompromising verdict on their abilities and the Co-op's record. He called for the replacement of the group's 20-strong elected board with a smaller board of six or seven non-executive directors with business experience and two executives from the group. Members would be represented on a new National Membership Council to hold the board to the group's values and principles. Directors would be elected and reelected each year by all members, overhauling the current system which puts power in the hands of a few hundred activists.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Adapt or die. Don't doubt the accuracy of Lord Myners' blunt message to members of Co-op Group. There are at least three reasons why the organisation is doomed to irrelevance, or worse, if it cannot recognise the size of the mess it is in. First, the Co-op's commercial record is appalling. Over 50 years, its share of the grocery market has fallen from a Tesco-like 30% to 5%. The past decade has seen cock-up follow cock-up. The Co-op overpaid for Somerfield in 2008 in pursuit of greater size and buying power but, in terms of market share, it finds itself back where it started. Meanwhile, the Co-op Bank is now 70% owned by outsiders after a \u00a31.5bn capital hole appeared. Sir Christopher Kelly's postmortem on the saga is awaited, but it's obvious that the acquisition in 2009 of Britannia Building Society, with its over-sized book of souring commercial property loans, was the prime cause. Myners' verdict on the Somerfield and Britannia deals \u2013 \"breathtakingly value-destructive\" \u2013 is supported by the numbers. Second, the rebuke that the Co-op suffers from a \"democratic deficit\" will sting because it is true. Ordinary members of the Co-op do not even get an automatic right to vote at the annual meeting. Instead, a system of block-votes from regional committees survives. This is a version of democracy but it has not produced a main board of elected members with the nous to prevent calamities like the Britannia deal, or even the madcap attempt to buy 630 branches from Lloyds. As argued here more than once, it's safe to run an amateur golf club via elected committees and sub-committees but you're inviting trouble at a business with an annual turnover of \u00a311bn, 2,800 shops and hard-nosed competitors such as Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda. Myners' proposal would see the Co-op adopt a main board akin to a plc board \u2013 that is, with a majority of independent non-executive directors and two executive directors. Then a \"national membership council,\" charged with policing co-operative values, would be created. Of course, big-name independent non-executives can also be dozy and incompetent \u2013 just look at Royal Bank of Scotland circa 2007 \u2013 but Co-op members should note that Nationwide Building Society and John Lewis recognise the need for external voices in the boardroom. Those organisations are prospering; theirs is failing. Third, the financial facts are serious. The society is about to announce a loss estimated at \u00a32bn, it owes its banks \u00a31.2bn at the last count and a mini price war has broken out in the supermarket sector. Throw in long-term pension liabilities and past sale and leaseback deals, and mainstream banks will not be queuing up to lend to an unreformed Co-op. The society would risk being slowly taken to the cleaners by its lenders. If losing control of the bank was painful, try being told to sell your successful funeral service. None of the above excuses the absurd spectacle of the Co-op's board agreeing to pay Euan Sutherland \u00a33.6m in his first year as chief executive \u2013 on a guaranteed basis, for heaven's sake. The sum would have been princely even for a successful mid-ranking FTSE 100 company. Myners says Sutherland intended to waive the bonus element of his package. If so, the now-departed chief should have said so, instead of handing ammunition to his boardroom opponents. Indeed, his pay terms should have been published on the day they were agreed, which is how grown-up companies in the quoted sector behave. Na\u00efvety all round. If Sutherland had been cuter, and thicker-skinned, he could still be in post. But the useful part of his departure is that the Co-op will now have to confront its troubles. Few top-tier chief executives would risk joining the Co-op until the governance debate is settled, so there is no point trying to hire a replacement until a vote on Myners' proposals, or any alternative reforms, has happened. So hurry up. Terrible timing Here's a rule of thumb for investing in leading retailers: when a share buy-back is announced, head for the hills \u2013 unless the company is called Next. Morrisons is the latest shopkeeper to demonstrate poor sense of its own worth and medium-term prospects. Amid this week's huge profit warning came news that the last piece of the \u00a31bn buy-back programme, launched in 2011, had been completed. Last year's annual report shows how the bulk of the \"equity retirement\" scheme was deployed: \u00a3947m was spent acquiring 312m shares, which works out at about 300p a pop. Price now: 208p. Hindsight is wonderful, of course, but the retail sector has an inglorious record of terrible timing. Home Retail, the Argos and Homebase group, spent \u00a3150m buying 64m of its shares at 233p apiece in 2010-11, just before the price crashed to 80p and the dividend was cut. Marks &amp; Spencer, in 2007-08, spent \u00a3592m at an average of 434p, just before a plunge to 200p and cut its dividend. Next is almost the only major retailer that gets it right. Two of chief executive Lord Wolfson's secrets are to do a little consistently \u2013 which in Next's case is ten consecutive years \u2013 and prefer special dividends if the share price outstrips growth in earnings per share Wolfson has a formula called \"equivalent rate of return\", to assist. Others seem to spend the money regardless of price and hope for the best. Naturally, Morrisons could point out that earnings per share were nevertheless boosted by its buy-back. Yes, but think how useful \u00a31bn could be today. Buying 312m shares would cost \u00a3650m and Morrisons would still have \u00a3300m to super-charge its price cuts in the battle against discounters Aldi and Lidl. Too late now. 'Cynical opportunism' Boo, hiss, the Ruia brothers are following through on their threat to bid for the minority interest in Essar Energy, the Indian-based energy firm, at just 70p. \"Our offer to minority shareholders represents a premium that is in line with precedent UK minority buyouts,\" said the statement from the Ruias' Essar Global fund, owner of a 78% stake. Strictly speaking, that's correct, since the shares had fallen to just 60p when the possibility of an offer was first mentioned a month ago. But, come on, Essar Global was talking about the \"exceptional value\" in Essar Energy when the price was 97p as recently as last November. Little of substance has happened since then. If anything, Essar Energy's troubles with coal permits and bureaucracy in India \u2013 two reasons why the shares have fallen from 2010's flotation price of 420p \u2013 have eased slightly. Chalk it up as yet another example of minority investors being sorely treated by a majority owner. \"Cynical opportunism\" and \"a calculated attempt to deprive minority shareholders of the substantial future upside\" was the understandable verdict of David Cumming at Standard Life when 70p appeared. Essar Energy's independent directors called 70p an \"undervaluation\" at the outset. Now they call it a \"material undervaluation.\" A tweak to the language won't change anything, however. What the episode demonstrates is that independents are utterly powerless when a majority owner is determined to get its way. Heads you win, tails you don't lose At the time of the so-called \"shareholder spring\" of 2012, Sly Bailey was routinely described as one of its victims as she was eased out of her \u00a3750,000-a-year post as chief executive of newspaper publisher Trinity Mirror. This judgement was clearly premature. Two years on, we learned this week that Bailey is in line to collect about \u00a3400,000 from Trinity Mirror in form of incentive shares. How come? Well, those shares have soared in value since she left. The fact that the valuation crashed by 90% on her long watch is irrelevant. This was \"the best that could be negotiated in the specific circumstances,\" says the company. A clearer case of heads you win, tails you don't lose is hard to imagine.",

News that more than $100bn had been shifted out of the US in the past week \u2013 at least three times more than at any time since the financial crisis \u2013 prompted fears that Russia is preparing for a western backlash in the form of sanctions and is moving its funds to safe havens beyond US influence. The bills were transferred out of the US central bank's deposit vaults last week, as the Obama administration increased the threat of sanctions in response to the growing crisis in east Ukraine. Last year the most moved in a week was $32bn. Analysts said that if the switch can be credited to Russia, it represents about 80% of the country's holdings in US Treasury bonds. The Russian central bank is likely to be behind the move, though wealthy Russian business figures are also expected to be concerned that Washington-imposed sanctions will freeze funds they have parked with the US central bank. Alexei Miller, the boss of energy firm Gazprom, and Igor Sechin, who runs oil company Rosneft, are likely to be among the many senior figures in Moscow adversely affected by any targeted sanctions imposed on Russia. The switch came to light after the US central bank reported that its weekly custody holdings of Treasury bonds \u2013 investments it keeps on behalf of outside investors \u2013 dropped $105bn for the week ending 12 March to $2.85tn from $2.96tn.",

Perhaps it's just too difficult to run something as big and complex as this in a purely democratic way.\" Lee worries that the crisis at the group is bringing the wider co-operative movement, which includes independent retail co-ops and small businesses, down with it. \"You can argue that the Co-op Group is destroying the brand. If you are a co-operative graphics business looking for work from clients, it can't be good for business. Potential clients may think: 'I've heard about these people. They can't run anything.' \"",

      "bodyText": "A report into a gas release and safety scare in the North Sea platform operated by French oil company Total has been passed to the prosecution authorities in Scotland after a two-year investigation. The Elgin platform spewed gas for nearly two months, forcing the crew to be evacuated and production halted. The Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE), which investigated the accident with the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), said it was now up to the Scottish legal system to decide what, if anything, happened next. \"We can confirm the HSE/DECC investigation reports into aspects of the well operations leading up the blowout have been presented to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, who will now consider our recommendations and decide what action is to be taken,\" said an HSE spokesman. The length of the investigation has been criticised in some quarters but the HSE said it was right to take as much time as was needed for such an important task. There has been heightened awareness in recent days of North Sea safety with a judge-led inquiry reporting on Thursday into the crash of a Super Puma helicopter 11 miles off Peterhead. Total was unable to comment but the company told a briefing of City analysts in 2012 that it did not expect to face prosecution over the gas leak, according to a note from RBC Capital Markets at the time. Some environmental campaigners have said Total should not be allowed to \"frack\" for shale gas in Britain until it has been exonerated over the Elgin accident. Lang Banks, Scotland director of environmental campaigners WWF, said it was \"right and proper\" that prosecutions be considered over the leak from Total's Elgin platform. \"While it was a relief that the Elgin leak was able to be stopped, the fact it happened at all and that a potent greenhouse gas was able to spew out for nearly two months was deeply concerning,\" he said. \"In the interests of tackling climate change and protecting the marine environment we urgently need to see a transition away from oil and gas toward pollution-free energy sources.\" BP learned on Thursday that the Environmental Protection Agency in the US had agreed to lift a ban on the UK-based oil firm bidding for drilling contracts or licences \u2013 the ban was imposed following the Macondo blowout of April 2010 in which 11 workers died.",

The west coast debacle in 2012 saw franchising thrown into disarray, but the terms of direct awards and extensions since agreed by the Department for Transport have been questioned by Labour. In a parliamentary answer the transport minister, Stephen Hammond, confirmed that from September 2015 the franchise was planned to be covered by a second direct award to First. This may run until 2020 with a proposed extension. The shadow transport secretary, Mary Creagh, said the deals would leave a \u00a3300m hole in the DfT's finances. She said: \"Ministers have now quietly announced another sweetheart deal with First Great Western Group, no doubt at rock-bottom prices, in stark contrast to their unwanted refranchising of the east coast line, run by a not-for-profit public operator which last year returned \u00a3191m to taxpayers.\" A spokesman for First said: \"The DfT has always stated that any decision on the future of the franchise would be based on delivering the best value for customers and taxpayers beyond September 2015.

There is a phrase frequently used in Co-operative group circles that the executive should be \u201con tap but not on top\u201d. It is now clear to me that this is a widely held but deeply flawed representation of the reality in recent years. Elected directors have simply not been up to their task of holding the executive to account. <br></p> <p>A second, quite fundamental concern is that this lack of effective governance exists in a situation where the Co-operative group\u2019s core business is in food retailing, an economic sector with high competitive intensity. <br></p> </blockquote> <p>The 20-strong Co-op group board does not include anyone from the executive team at present. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-03-14T12:10:52.265Z\">at 12.10pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5322edaee4b05ba05a3f8cb4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-14T11:53:55.899Z\">11.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More from the Myners report on the Co-op:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Co-operative group suffers from acute systemic weaknesses in its governance framework that over many years have gravely damaged the organisation.

Admittedly, the overall trade deficit always looked likely to widen from December\u2019s \u00a30.7bn figure, which was flattered by sharp fall in imports of ships and cars, which are often volatile. But January\u2019s deficit of \u00a32.6bn was bigger than the fourth quarter\u2019s average of \u00a31.8bn and 2013\u2019s average of \u00a32.2bn, indicating that there is still no underlying improvement in the UK\u2019s trade position. The deterioration was driven by a sharp 4% monthly fall in exports \u2013 perhaps an early sign that the stronger pound is starting to have an adverse effect on the UK\u2019s economic recovery.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the fact that the latest industrial surveys show that export orders have grown strongly in recent months may provide some grounds for optimism.

A series of retaliatory sanctions would be unhelpful, although clearly preferable to any military conflict. Meanwhile, there are growing worries about Chinese growth and financial stability, as well as ongoing uncertainty over the strength of the US economy. Surprisingly, risk sentiment in the financial markets has held up well. There could be upsets in the near term before the underlying resilience of the major economies becomes more apparent.</p> <p>The pendulum has been swinging away from Crimea remaining a regular part of Ukraine, although there still are feasible permutations in which Crimea could remain within Ukraine, albeit with greater links to Russia. The probable series of US and EU sanctions and counter-sanctions in the event of a full Crimean breakaway would weaken global growth and badly sap risk sentiment. </p> <p>On a brighter note, some greater certainty is returning to the <b>US outlook</b>, following a better-than expected-labour report for February, lessening the chances of the US sliding back towards stagnation. It really does look as if the recent bad weather was mainly to blame for data disappointments. </p> <p>The <b>eurozone</b> is turning the corner on growth, but this brings with it unhelpful upward pressure on the currency. With still-weak growth and plenty of risks on the horizon, this provides an unhelpful brake on the recovery. But the ECB is struggling to indicate its unease regarding EUR strength, with Draghi playing down the prospects of deflation and, in the process, giving EUR another lift. It is probably the case that there is no more easing to come from the ECB, but the sustained strength in the EUR may at least force a shift towards more cautious rhetoric. </p> <p>The <b>UK story remains very encouraging</b>, with growth, employment and house prices rising strongly. However, there is little sign of a rebalancing yet \u2013 a concern for the medium term. </p> <p>Chinese data remains distorted by Lunar New Year timing, although it does look as if there has been some slowdown in activity. But it is probably attempts to deter arbitrage between the offshore CNH and the onshore CNY, rather than overt concerns over growth or a move to a wider trading band that have prompted higher CNY fixings recently. </p> </blockquote> <p>For a video overview of this month\u2019s update click <a href=\"http://ing.kuluvalley.com/view/jnUjKhE7QZu\">here</a>. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-03-14T10:41:12.519Z\">at 10.41am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5322d70fe4b0b23261daf4b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-14T10:17:16.479Z\">10.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Flexing its military muscle, Russia has sent fighter jets to the Mediterranean for training exercises.

The Russian stock market MICEX fell over 5% in early trading and is now down 0.6% at 1240.69. In London, the FTSE 100 index is 0.4% lower at 6528.93.

Brent crude oil rose above $108 a barrel amid fears over Russian oil supplies. Lord Myners has released a damning report on the Co-op, warning it will go bust unless it takes radical action Boohoo.com jumped 70% on its stock market debut More reaction to Myners\u2019 Co-op report. The boss of Britain\u2019s financial watchdog has urged shareholders to get tough with banks if they want to see an end to huge bonus payouts. Martin Wheatley, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said the competition for talent, which bank bosses cite as the reason they need to pay massive pay packages, was \u201cself-perpetuating\u201d, adding: \u201cThe trouble is if you just accept that you can never actually change this.\u201d Wheatley told the Evening Standard that investors have started to grumble in quite a sotto voce way. They are not really getting in there with big sticks. Over in the US, producer prices fell by 0.1% in February following a 0.2% rise in January, offering little evidence of a pick-up in inflationary pressures \u2013 and giving the Fed leeway to keep interest rates near zero for many more months. On Monday 17 March at 6.45pm Lord Myners is doing a live webinar broadcast to discuss the progress he is making on the Co-op. If you want to participate, you can register and submit any questions here. Last year the Co-op faced the biggest crisis in its 150-year history with the need to recapitalise its Bank. The mutual\u2019s crisis deepened this week when its chief executive Euan Sutherland walked out after just 10 months in the job, branding the organisation as \u201cungovernable\u201d. His departure followed a report in the Observer about his \u00a36.6m pay package for 2013 and 2014. Myners proposed a new board with an independent chair with no previous involvement with the group; six to seven independent non-executive directors; and two executive directors. This new board would chop the existing 20-strong elected board in half. He also proposed a national membership council of 100 individuals, including 20 employees, charged with ensuring the group adheres to co-operative values. The recommendations will be put to the Co-op\u2019s annual meeting in May. The Co-op report makes compelling reading. Castigating the mutual\u2019s (lack of) governance, Lord Myners writes: I am deeply troubled by the disdain and lack of respect for the executive team that I have witnessed from some members of the group board. There is a phrase frequently used in Co-operative group circles that the executive should be \u201con tap but not on top\u201d. It is now clear to me that this is a widely held but deeply flawed representation of the reality in recent years. Elected directors have simply not been up to their task of holding the executive to account. A second, quite fundamental concern is that this lack of effective governance exists in a situation where the Co-operative group\u2019s core business is in food retailing, an economic sector with high competitive intensity. The 20-strong Co-op group board does not include anyone from the executive team at present. More from the Myners report on the Co-op: The Co-operative group suffers from acute systemic weaknesses in its governance framework that over many years have gravely damaged the organisation. These failings include a series of costly strategic misjudgements that have undermined the group\u201fs competitive position and severely eroded its capital base. The group board have collectively presided over losses of several billion pounds in the course of the last few years. Debt has reached levels that are no longer sustainable without the sale of treasured assets. Sale and leaseback transactions represent an expensive addiction the cost of which does not appear, even now, to be fully appreciated by the board. You can read Lord Myners\u2019 full report here. Former City minister and Labour peer Lord Myners is conducting a review of the Co-op, in his capacity as an independent director of the group, which spans supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies. In a damning progress update, he warned that the company will run out of money unless it carries out \u201cradical reform\u201d of its board. In the face of a massive failure of governance the need for radical reform of the group board is inescapable. Unless the group takes urgent steps to reform its governance so that it generates sustainable economic value, it will run out of capital to support its business. The FTSE 100 index in London is on course for its biggest weekly fall since June, having dropped 2.8% so far this week. It is currently off 0.3%, nearly 20 points, at 6534.51. Its record weekly fall last June was triggered by the US Federal Reserve hinting it would taper economic stimulus measures later that year. Germany\u2019s and France\u2019s main stock markets are also down, by 0.4% and 0.7% respectively. Gold has touched six-month highs as tensions mount in Ukraine. IG analyst Alastair McCraig said: Today has the distinc whiff of a \u2018risk-off\u2019 day as traders clear the decks ahead of Crimea voting this weekend. Every noise I\u2019ve hard suggests that Crimea will vote to join Russia... and while the market is expecting that, it\u2019s consequences of it that make it more problematic. Still reeling from its shock profit warning yesterday, embattled supermarket chain Morrisons suffered a theft of data from its staff payroll. The company said it learned yesterday that the data had been published on the internet and sent on a disc to a newspaper. Tensions are rising in Ukraine, with Russia sending more troops and armour to Crimea and repeating its threat to invade other parts of Ukraine. Responding to the death of at least one protester in Ukraine\u2019s eastern city of Donetsk, the Russian foreign ministry repeated Putin\u2019s declaration: Russia is aware of its responsibility for the lives of compatriots and fellow citizens in Ukraine and reserves the right to take people under its protection. Russian stock markets have tumbled and the cost of insuring the country\u2019s debt has soared today. Eurozone data show that employment across the currency bloc edged up 0.1% quarter-on-quarter between October and December \u2013 marking the first rise since the second quarter of 2011 and following flat readings in the previous two quarters. The breakdown contains some encouraging news: Portugal has seen three consecutive quarters of growth. Spanish employment rose 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter although it was still down by 1.3% year-on-year. Portuguese employment was up 0.7% on the quarter and 0.5% on the year. Greek employment edged up 0.2% on the quarter, taking the annual decline down to 2.6% from 2.9% in the third quarter. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, says this is another sign that eurozone labour markets have stabilised overall and \u201cmay be even starting to see slight improvement after extended, marked weakness\u201d. While this is relatively encouraging, unemployment remains worryingly high across the eurozone and it seems unlikely to come down markedly any time soon given probably gradual recovery. Stabilising eurozone labour markets, very low inflation and improved overall confidence should provide some support to consumer spending over the coming months, although any improvement still seems most likely to be gradual given that unemployment is still high overall and earnings growth is generally weak. Returning to the UK\u2019s disappointing trade figures [see 9.41am], Capital Economics economist Samuel Tombs laments that the UK economy is still not enjoying a net trade boost. January\u2019s trade figures continue the disappointing run of news on the UK\u2019s export performance. Admittedly, the overall trade deficit always looked likely to widen from December\u2019s \u00a30.7bn figure, which was flattered by sharp fall in imports of ships and cars, which are often volatile. But January\u2019s deficit of \u00a32.6bn was bigger than the fourth quarter\u2019s average of \u00a31.8bn and 2013\u2019s average of \u00a32.2bn, indicating that there is still no underlying improvement in the UK\u2019s trade position. The deterioration was driven by a sharp 4% monthly fall in exports \u2013 perhaps an early sign that the stronger pound is starting to have an adverse effect on the UK\u2019s economic recovery. Looking ahead, the fact that the latest industrial surveys show that export orders have grown strongly in recent months may provide some grounds for optimism. But given that these surveys have been misleadingly upbeat for several months now, we would not place too much weight on them. With demand from the UK\u2019s main trading partners in the euro-zone unlikely to rise significantly soon, we continue to think that the UK\u2019s economic recovery will receive little in the way of support from the external sector this year. In other trade news.... The global markets research team at ING says in its global monthly update, entitled \u201cUnrest on the Eastern front\u201d: The escalating standoff between Ukraine and Russia over Crimea presents a new risk to the global outlook. A series of retaliatory sanctions would be unhelpful, although clearly preferable to any military conflict. Meanwhile, there are growing worries about Chinese growth and financial stability, as well as ongoing uncertainty over the strength of the US economy. Surprisingly, risk sentiment in the financial markets has held up well. There could be upsets in the near term before the underlying resilience of the major economies becomes more apparent. The pendulum has been swinging away from Crimea remaining a regular part of Ukraine, although there still are feasible permutations in which Crimea could remain within Ukraine, albeit with greater links to Russia. The probable series of US and EU sanctions and counter-sanctions in the event of a full Crimean breakaway would weaken global growth and badly sap risk sentiment. On a brighter note, some greater certainty is returning to the US outlook, following a better-than expected-labour report for February, lessening the chances of the US sliding back towards stagnation. It really does look as if the recent bad weather was mainly to blame for data disappointments. The eurozone is turning the corner on growth, but this brings with it unhelpful upward pressure on the currency. With still-weak growth and plenty of risks on the horizon, this provides an unhelpful brake on the recovery. But the ECB is struggling to indicate its unease regarding EUR strength, with Draghi playing down the prospects of deflation and, in the process, giving EUR another lift. It is probably the case that there is no more easing to come from the ECB, but the sustained strength in the EUR may at least force a shift towards more cautious rhetoric. The UK story remains very encouraging, with growth, employment and house prices rising strongly. However, there is little sign of a rebalancing yet \u2013 a concern for the medium term. Chinese data remains distorted by Lunar New Year timing, although it does look as if there has been some slowdown in activity. But it is probably attempts to deter arbitrage between the offshore CNH and the onshore CNY, rather than overt concerns over growth or a move to a wider trading band that have prompted higher CNY fixings recently. For a video overview of this month\u2019s update click here. Flexing its military muscle, Russia has sent fighter jets to the Mediterranean for training exercises. The US navy, in turn, has sent a guided-missile destroyer, the USS Truxtun, to the Black Sea on what it said was a routing deployment scheduled before the crisis in Ukraine broke out. Northern Ireland\u2019s richest man Edward Haughey was among four people killed when a civilian helicopter crashed in Norfolk last night. Haughey, 70, a member of the House of Lords was Northern Ireland\u2019s richest with an estimated fortune of \u00a3600m, according to the Sunday Times\u2019 annual Rich List. Haughey also served in the upper chamber of parliament in the Irish Republic where he was born. He was the founder and chairman of Northern Ireland-based Norbrook Laboratories, the largest privately owned pharmaceutical company in the world. It employs over 1,700 people and former Northern Ireland economy minister Reg Empey said Haughey had brought jobs to the British province during the \u201cdarkest days\u201d of the troubles. In the latest Ukraine-Russia developments, US Secretary of State John Kerry will seek assurances from his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov that Russia will not annex Crimea and will opt for negotiations \u2013 despite massing troops on the Russian border with Ukraine. Kerry and Lavrov meet in London later today for last-minute talks on how to defuse tensions as pro-Russian officials in Crimea are preparing to hold a referendum on the region\u2019s future on Sunday. The vote will decide whether Crimea \u2013 a Russian-majority region of Ukraine \u2013 will become part of Russia. Kerry has warned the Kremlin that the US and EU will impose sanctions as soon as Monday if the referendum goes ahead. A US State Department official said: What we would like to see is a commitment to stop putting new facts on the ground and a commitment to engage seriously on ways to de-escalate the conflict, to bring Russian forces back to barracks, to use international observers in place of force to achieve legitimate political and human rights objectives. Kerry has already met with David Cameron, who said Britain wanted to see progress as much as the US. Britain\u2019s trade in goods deficit widened to nearly \u00a310bn in January, against expectations of a \u00a38.6bn shortfall. Exports fell to their lowest level in more than a year and a half. The deficit ballooned to \u00a39.79bn from \u00a37.6bn in December, although that figure was flattered by one-off factors. The Office for National Statistics said Britain\u2019s overall trade deficit, including the huge services industry, widened to \u00a32.565bn from \u00a3668m in December. Separate figures showed output in Britain\u2019s construction industry rose 1.8% in January. The ONS also revised construction output in the fourth quarter to a fall of 0.2%, from a previously reported gain of 0.2%. The change was not big enough to affect overall economic growth between October and December, which came in at 0.7%. Another pay row is brewing in Switzerland, where UBS raised chief executive Sergio Ermotti\u2019s pay by a fifth last year to 10.73m Swiss francs. The Swiss bank\u2019s annual report, published this morning, also shows that UBS\u2019s highest paid executive was investment banking boss Andrea Orcel, who received 11.43 million francs in 2013. Chairman Axel Weber was paid nearly 6.1 million francs. UBS already came under fire from shareholders earlier this year when it revealed its bonus pool went up by 28% to 3.2 billion francs from 2012. Ermotti said compensation at the bank was now \u201cnormalised\u201d after pay packages were cut in 2012 when UBS had to pay out $1.5bn to settle interest rate allegations. Executive remuneration is a closely watched topic in Switzerland. Voters backed some of the world\u2019s strictest controls on pay last year, forcing public companies to give shareholders a binding vote on compensation. UBS is in the spotlight because taxpayers funded a 6 billion franc bailout of the bank in 2008, although the Swiss government sold its stake in UBS at a profit the following year. Shares in British Biotech firm Circassia, which made its stock market debut yesterday \u2013 the biggest UK biotech flotation in more than a decade \u2013 are flat this morning at 310p, valuing the business at \u00a3581m. The firm is developing vaccines for cat allergies, hayfever and dust mites. The shares, which listed at 310p, also ended flat on their first day of trading after hitting a session high of 316.75p. Circassia raised \u00a3200m, some of which it will use to bring the cat allergy vaccine, which is in late-stage clinical trials, to market. Circassia is 20% owned by Imperial Innovations, which invests in spin-out companies from Britain\u2019s top universities. Retail analyst Nick Bubb says about the Boohoo.com float: The IPO of mighty Boohoo.com launched today at 8am, amidst fevered speculation about the size of the premium over the 50p offer price...and the answer is about 60%, with the shares trading around the 80p mark, which puts the market cap at around \u00a3900m, up with the likes of Halfords, Debenhams and Ted Baker. Shares in British online fashion retailer Boohoo.com surged 70% as it made its debut on London\u2019s AIM market. The shares opened at 85p, above the offer price of 50p, and are now trading at 78.5p. It\u2019s another successful float after Poundland and Pets at Home started trading earlier this week. While Russian stock markets have fallen sharply, European shares are not having a good time either. Germany\u2019s Dax is heading for its worst week since June 2012 and is currently trading nearly 0.6% lower, or 51.93 points, at 8965.86. The FTSE 100 index in London is 0.3% lower at 6532.63, down 21.18 points and France\u2019s CAC has lost 0.4%. Bank of Georgia, the leading bank in Georgia, is leading fallers on the FTSE 250 index in London, falling nearly 7%. It turns out the Kremlin\u2019s website was brought down by hackers this morning \u2013 like the Bank of Russia website \u2013 but it now working again, the Kremlin press service says, according to Reuters. Russia\u2019s debt insurance costs have hit their highest level in nearly two years amid mounting concerns over the impact of potential western sanctions. Russian 5-year credit default swaps have risen 18 basis points from 285bps at yesterday\u2019s close, the highest since June 2012, according to data company Markit. The Russian central bank\u2019s website has been attacked by hackers before a meeting on interest rates. The Bank of Russia said in a statement: The site of the central bank is experiencing problems due to a hacker attack. The site, www.cbr.ru, went down this morning but is now back up. The central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold after raising them two weeks ago, after a declaration by President Vladimir Putin that Russia has the right to invade Ukraine sent the rouble and stock markets tumbling. The Kremlin\u2019s web site, www.kremlin.ru, also experienced problems earlier today but the president\u2019s press service said it was a \u201ctechnical issue\u201d. Developments in Ukraine are not good for the Russian stock market, Micex, now down 4.3% at 1195.84. Earlier it fell more than 5% to its lowest level since October 2009, two days before the referendum that is expected to lead to western sanctions against Russia. The dollar-denominated RTS index lost 5.1% to hit the lowest level since August 2009. Russian stock indices have lost 18% this month. A trader at a western bank in Moscow told Reuters: People are panicking because of probable sanctions and international isolation. Who will need these shares then? Good morning. Welcome back to the business live blog. We\u2019ll be tracking events across the financial markets, the economy, eurozone and business. Asian stock markets hit a one-month low overnight, spooked by reports of a build-up of Russian troops on Ukraine\u2019s eastern border ahead of the weekend referendum on the future of Crimea. In the absence of major economic data today, markets will focus on what happens in Ukraine and Russia. Europe is likely to open lower following yesterday\u2019s declines. The Russian stock market has dropped 4.8% this morning. In a show of force, Russia launched new military exercises near its border with Ukraine yesterday, while pro-Russian authorities in Crimea are preparing a referendum in Crimea to rubberstamp the region\u2019s unification with Russia. Continuing worries about China are also sapping sentiment, particularly after Chinese premier Li Keqiang warned of future \u201cunavoidable\u201d defaults on bonds and other financial products yesterday. We will get UK trade numbers for January at 9.30am GMT. They are forecast to show a widening in Britain\u2019s trade deficit to \u00a38.6bn. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: One thing is for sure traders would be foolish to make the mistake they made two weeks ago and go home long into the weekend, particularly with the situation on the ground in Ukraine so potentially fluid, and the Crimea referendum vote due on Sunday.",

By raising prices of homes, especially in London and the south-east, Help to Buy defeats the purpose of extending access to housing. The six-point plan proposed here would result in a more durable recovery powered by much-needed investment in infrastructure and housing.

But the current exclusive concern with debt is a big mistake: the government's asset position is just as important because assets help to generate the future income to service the debt or can be sold to pay down debt. For example, roads generate revenue directly, even without road pricing or toll roads, from taxes on petrol and licences, and indirectly from the economic activity they lubricate.</p> <p>The real rate of return in Britain on such infrastructure investment \u2013 for example, upgrading the A1 in the north-east \u2013 greatly exceeds the current cost of funding. Further, much of government-owned land is obviously saleable and not hard to value. It makes no sense to include only financial assets in government net debt and exclude potentially saleable land.</p> <p>The first announcement of the budget should therefore state that, in future, the government will target the growth of debt minus assets.</p> <p>Increasing government debt would then not be a concern if it was matched by an increase in assets such as publicly owned productive infrastructure and land. This better target would also discourage the accounting practices of the Brown era, when expensive PFI contracts were used to fund public sector investment without recognising the underlying liabilities.</p> <p>The second fundamental announcement in the budget, made possible by the first, should be the setting up of a national land bank. This acquires land cheaply and holds it for future release for housing and commercial development. In countries such as South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, national land banks have played major roles in urban development, supplying land for housing, generating planning gain to pay for infrastructure and in controlling real estate prices.</p> <p>In Britain, with sometimes hundred-fold price differences between land with and without planning permission, a government land bank could buy land without residential or commercial planning permission but with potential for future development. In future, this would be a source of land release for housing and other development, capturing planning gain for the taxpayer. Such land purchases would initially have zero impact on correctly measured net debt, but future revaluation gains would bring down net debt, while the cashflow from sales would lower future government deficits.</p> <p>This radical step, together with better incentives for local authorities to grant planning permissions, would transform the supply of housing in under-housed Britain. Currently, young people without wealthy and generous relatives have great difficulty getting onto the housing ladder. According to the census the fraction of owner occupiers among those aged 25 to 34 has declined from 58% in 2001 to 40% in 2011.

BP said it had now dropped its law suit after resolving outstanding problems with the EPA but the firm will have to abide by monitoring arrangements with the agency for the next five years. \"After a lengthy negotiation, BP is pleased to have reached this resolution, which we believe to be fair and reasonable,\" said John Ming\u00e9, head of BP America. \"Today's agreement will allow America's largest energy investor to compete again for federal contracts and leases.\" BP, which claims to have invested almost $50bn (\u00a330bn) in the US over the past five years, is still awaiting a court ruling about whether it was grossly negligent when it caused the biggest sea-borne pollution incident in American history. The firm is confident it will be judged to have acted responsibly but a gross negligence finding would expose BP to billions of dollars worth of extra fines. Some environmental groups have expressed opposition to the EPA deal. The Gulf Restoration Network, based in New Orleans, told the New York Times it was outrageous to allow BP to expand its offshore interests given its track record.",

The repeal of the Qantas Sale Act is unlikely to make it through the Senate and when asked specifically if Qantas would seek a debt guarantee again if the sale act repeal failed Joyce replied: \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through the process now for over a number of months with both the previous government and this government about fixing the distortion [in the market] ... as we worked through that process the government gave a range of options and the government has made a decision the repeal is the appropriate way, we support the government in that and I think anything past that is hypothetical; we fully support the government in correcting this distortion.\u201d When asked if he took responsibility for the position of Qantas, Joyce said the increase in competitors in the Australian aviation market meant \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d what he did as CEO Qantas was going to take a hit to its profitability. \u201cThe impact on profitability has come from an environment that has resulted from oversupply of capacity internationally \u2026 I take over the last two years we\u2019ve seen a 46% increase in capacity coming in to Australia from the international market,\u201d he said. Joyce cited the carbon tax as another business impact when he was asked if any government decision had led Qantas to its loss making position. \u201cThere are a lot of decisions that go back a while that have had an impact, this market being one of the most liberal markets in the world means we\u2019ve had 46% capacity growth since 2009,\u201d he said. \u201c...we\u2019ve had the addition of ability of 100% domestic ownership, you go to the states and it\u2019s 25% maximum, we\u2019ve had restrictions in Australia market that have allowed Tiger to be 100% owned by Virgin, one of the imposts on us has been the carbon tax; it\u2019s added $106m to our bottom line and we\u2019ve been pretty consistent on our view on the carbon tax, it does cause distortions.\u201d When asked why Qantas originally asked for a debt guarantee, seeing it as the best thing the Australian government could do for the company Joyce replied: \u201cI think it\u2019s academic now, the process has gone on.\u201d Joyce said the company would continue with its domestic plan of cornering the corporate and leisure markets in Australia and people who said Qantas should back away from its domestic dominance of routes did not realise what a hit that would be to the core profitability of the company. When asked if he had the support of staff, Joyce replied: \u201cI absolutely believe Qantas staff are aware the company needs change and the best way to secure as many jobs as possible is to make the changes we are making. They are behind the management in what we need to do and what we need to change. We have to make tough decisions It\u2019s not easy making 5000 people redundant.\u201d",
