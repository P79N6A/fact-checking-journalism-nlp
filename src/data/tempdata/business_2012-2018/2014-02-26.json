      "bodyText": "Qantas has announced it will cut 5000 full-time jobs, extend wage freezes and scrap under-performing flight routes as part of a plan to reduce costs by $2bn over three years. It has posted an underlying loss before tax of $252m for the last six months of 2013, as the Abbott government considers potential assistance for Qantas, which has complained about an \u201cuneven playing field\u201d in the airline industry. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said the \u201ctruly devastating\u201d job cuts represented the worst day in Australian aviation since the collapse of Ansett. The Transport Workers\u2019 Union national secretary, Tony Sheldon, raised the prospect of strike action unless the government worked with the airline to find ways to avoid the job losses. \u201cBut if [the treasurer] Joe Hockey\u2019s not prepared to do that, then it\u2019s industrial action that the workforce should be considering,\u201d Sheldon said. Australia\u2019s national airline cited a \u201cdeterioration in business performance and operating environment\u201d for the need to reduce full-time-equivalent positions by 5000, including 1000 job cuts flagged in early December. More than 50 aircraft would be deferred or sold. Chief executive Alan Joyce said the company would accelerate its \u201cQantas transformation program\u201d to achieve $2bn in cost reductions by the 2016-17 financial year. He said he regretted the need for the job losses and they were not a reflection on the performance of hard-working Qantas employees. \u201cHard decisions will be necessary to overcome the challenges we face and build a stronger business,\u201d Joyce said, flagging talks with unions on Friday. \u201cThere are many examples of Australian companies that have failed because they have not been prepared to make the hard decisions. Qantas is not one of them.\u201d Qantas said the 5,000 full-time equivalent positions across the group would incur about $500m in redundancy costs across the financial years 2013-14 and 2014-15. This would include a reduction of management and non-operational areas by about 1,500 full-time-equivalent positions and the loss of operational positions affected by fleet and network changes. Joyce said every aspect of the company would be affected. Unions complained about a lack of consultation, arguing the cuts would deepen Australia\u2019s \u201cjobs crisis\u201d. Qantas had already implemented a wage freeze for executives but now wants to extend this to all Qantas Group employees. The company said it would freeze wages until the Qantas Group made a full-year underlying profit \u2013 a move that would be ongoing for executives, immediate for open enterprise bargaining agreements (EBAs) and proposed for other EBA-covered staff. Line maintenance operations and catering facilities would also be restructured, including the previously announced closure of the Adelaide catering centre. Qantas would proceed with its previously announced closure of the Avalon maintenance base. Qantas said it would exit underperforming routes and make aircraft changes on certain routes to better match capacity to demand. This would include withdrawing Qantas International from the Perth-Singapore route and operating all Sydney-Singapore and Brisbane-Singapore services with A330-300s from later this year. Qantas said it would adjust the timing of services between Melbourne and London to reduce A380 ground time in Heathrow, but the overall capacity on this route would not change. Qantas shares fell about 7.5% to $1.17 in morning trade. The government has been considering providing Qantas with an emergency debt guarantee, despite unease from some senior ministers and Liberal backbenchers. Virgin has argued a debt guarantee would give Qantas a \u201cleg-up\u201d worth at least $100m a year and would amount to \u201cpicking winners\u201d. It is understood the government\u2019s preferred course of action would be to remove government-imposed restrictions, including on the level of foreign ownership, set out in the Qantas Sale Act. But the prospects of getting such changes through parliament are murky. Joyce said Labor and the Greens had indicated they would not support changing the Qantas Sale Act, meaning such legislation was unlikely to pass before the new Senate takes effect in July. He noted the Palmer United party, which will have a powerful role in the new Senate, had also signalled its opposition, indicating no changes to the act were realistic in the short term. Joyce said Qantas could compete \u201cin any fair fight\u201d and he would continue discussions with the government about levelling the playing field. \u201cThe Australian domestic market has been distorted by current Australian aviation policy, which allows Virgin Australia to be majority-owned by three foreign government-backed airlines \u2013 yet retain access to Australian bilateral flying rights. Late last year, these three foreign-airline shareholders invested more than $300m in Virgin Australia at a time when, as Virgin Australia reported to the ASX on 6 February, it was losing money,\u201d Joyce said. Shorten accused the government of not acting quickly enough to spell out its clear plans to assist Qantas, having known of the need for action since 6 December. \u201cThat the Abbott government has done nothing to try and fight for Australian jobs at Qantas, like they failed to do anything for Australian jobs in other closures announced, is truly alarming,\u201d he said. The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Dave Oliver, said the 5000 workers had been dealt a major blow through no fault of their own. Oliver said the company\u2019s business plans were focused on \u201cmanaging decline and not necessarily going for growth\u201d. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement further plunges Australia into a jobs crisis,\u201d he said. Oliver said the government\u2019s calls for Qantas to get its house in order were code for job cuts. He said a repeal of the Qantas Sale Act would lead to further outsourcing and job losses but unions would support \u201csome form of debt guarantee\u201d. Such a guarantee should be conditional on a commitment to maintaining Australian jobs, Oliver said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of Scotland's biggest companies, engineering group Weir, has commissioned a report into the implications of Scottish independence on businesses after warning that \"very serious questions\" need to be answered. The Glasgow-based company, which employs about 14,000 people in more than 70 countries, said that business must have a voice in the debate alongside the political rhetoric of the yes and no camps. Keith Cochrane, Weir's chief executive, said the company would publicise the findings of its report, which will consider currency, pensions, trade and taxation, by early April. He said: \"This is a big issue, the debate needs to be focused on objective facts. Alongside other voters, I will personally be able to participate on 18 September, but I think it's really important that business contributes to that debate.\" Although Scottish companies have been wary of entering the independence debate, Weir was among the first to raise concerns about going it alone in 2012, when Cochrane warned that talk of secession was creating uncertainty for businesses. More companies have broken cover since, with BP's chief executive, Bob Dudley, entering the debate earlier this month. Dudley, who oversees a major player in the North Sea oil and gas industry, said he did not want to see Scotland \"drifting away\" from the UK. He warned BP would almost certainly face higher costs due to uncertainty over the currency, which would endanger investment. Dudley spoke out after an intervention by George Osborne, when the chancellor said a currency union based on the pound would be \"unworkable\" in the wake of analysis by the Bank of England. Cochrane revealed the plan as he presented Weir's full-year results, predicting a return to growth in 2014 following a fall in profit and revenue in 2013. Pre-tax profit at the company \u2013 which sells pumps and valves to the mining and oil and gas industries \u2013 fell 5% to \u00a3418m in the year to 3 January. Revenue at the group fell by 4% to \u00a32.4bn. Weir was hit by delays to projects as companies in the mining industry took a cautious approach to investment amid continuing falls in metal prices from 2011 highs. \"2013 was a tough year for us both in minerals and in oil and gas,\" Cochrane said, adding that the group had relied on\"self help\", including diversification which offset some of the challenges in its core mining market, improving operational efficiency, and strong growth in its after sales business, where orders were up 16% on 2012 and which accounted for 63% of revenues last year. \"2014 is going to be another tough year, but what we're saying is we started 2014 against a better backdrop than we started 2013,\" Cochrane said. \"We anticipate that the group will return to underlying growth despite mixed end market conditions.\" The Weir board recommended a final dividend of 33.2p a share, taking the full-year total to 42p a share, up 11% and marking the 30th consecutive year of dividend growth. Shares closed up 7% at \u00a325.19. Analysts at UBS said Weir was \"one of the most attractively positioned mining equipment businesses\" with a strong after sales market and improving outlook for orders in 2014.",

Almost 60% of ITV's content is made by ITV Studios.</p> <p>Crozier ruled out a bid for Channel 5, saying an offer would have attracted regulatory scrutiny, given the combined power of the two channels in the advertising market. First-round bids for Channel 5, which is owned by Daily Express proprietor Richard Desmond, are due on Thursday, with BSkyB and the US-based Discovery Communications expected to make a joint bid.</p> <p>But Crozier said ITV would continue to look at acquisitions, especially in the US and Britain. ITV is more than three-and-a-half years into a five-year turnaround plan, which includes cutting costs and buying production companies, as it attempts to shield its business from the deteriorating market for free-to-air advertising.</p> <p>In a 12-month buying spree, ITV Studios acquired four production companies. It has bought The Garden and Big Talk in Britain, in deals aimed at boosting its factual entertainment and comedy formats, as well as Thinkfactory Media and High Noon Entertainment in the US.</p> <p>These purchases helped ITV Studios increase its revenue by 20% to \u00a3857m, although ITV said some of the growth was not due to acquisitions. The cost-cutting part of the turnaround plan is set to continue, albeit at a slower pace, with further cuts of \u00a310m pencilled in for 2014, after \u00a328m in cuts last year.</p> <p>However, the announcement of a \u00a3161m special dividend fell short of market expectations, causing ITV shares to slide 3.5% to 199p, with some analysts expecting a payout of at least \u00a3200m.</p> <p>Keith Bowman at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers said Crozier's transformation plan was \"clearly blossoming\". But he warned that ITV faced ongoing pressure on revenues, with advertising sales likely to be increasingly volatile as companies demand slots for live TV events with guaranteed audiences.</p> <p>Crozier said ITV, which is broadcasting this year's World Cup from Brazil, would be \"always interested\" in future sports rights despite losing the Champions League broadcast franchise to BT.</p>",

Under his leadership, ITV has reversed the decline in domestic programming, by winning audiences and advertisers with mass market hits including Dancing on Ice and I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! Meanwhile, Downton Abbey and Broadchurch have restored a reputation for drama that had been obscured by the success of entertainment formats such as the X Factor and I'm a Celebrity. Crozier said ITV's broadcast channels had enjoyed their best year of viewing, while the main ITV channel had seen Emmerdale compete effectively for audiences against the BBC's Eastenders. The strategy of exporting formats has also paid off, with Mr Selfridge, Marple and Hell's Kitchen US sold to more than 150 countries, while eight of its formats have been sold to multiple countries, including I'm a Celebrity and Dancing on Ice. Almost 60% of ITV's content is made by ITV Studios. Crozier ruled out a bid for Channel 5, saying an offer would have attracted regulatory scrutiny, given the combined power of the two channels in the advertising market. First-round bids for Channel 5, which is owned by Daily Express proprietor Richard Desmond, are due on Thursday, with BSkyB and the US-based Discovery Communications expected to make a joint bid. But Crozier said ITV would continue to look at acquisitions, especially in the US and Britain. ITV is more than three-and-a-half years into a five-year turnaround plan, which includes cutting costs and buying production companies, as it attempts to shield its business from the deteriorating market for free-to-air advertising. In a 12-month buying spree, ITV Studios acquired four production companies. It has bought The Garden and Big Talk in Britain, in deals aimed at boosting its factual entertainment and comedy formats, as well as Thinkfactory Media and High Noon Entertainment in the US. These purchases helped ITV Studios increase its revenue by 20% to \u00a3857m, although ITV said some of the growth was not due to acquisitions. The cost-cutting part of the turnaround plan is set to continue, albeit at a slower pace, with further cuts of \u00a310m pencilled in for 2014, after \u00a328m in cuts last year. However, the announcement of a \u00a3161m special dividend fell short of market expectations, causing ITV shares to slide 3.5% to 199p, with some analysts expecting a payout of at least \u00a3200m. Keith Bowman at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers said Crozier's transformation plan was \"clearly blossoming\". But he warned that ITV faced ongoing pressure on revenues, with advertising sales likely to be increasingly volatile as companies demand slots for live TV events with guaranteed audiences. Crozier said ITV, which is broadcasting this year's World Cup from Brazil, would be \"always interested\" in future sports rights despite losing the Champions League broadcast franchise to BT.",

Roberts, 40, cashed in 10% of shares giving him an \u00a386m payday. He still owns 28.6% of the company, worth about \u00a3442m. The finance director, Steve Caunce, owns 13.6% of the shares worth more than \u00a3200m. Other directors own 17.1%. Roberts, who \"wasn't very academic at school\" and left without any qualifications to work in a kitchen distribution warehouse, said he was \"delighted\" the float had been so well received by investors. \"They have understood our business model and our potential. We welcome them as shareholders,\" he said. The shares, which floated at 285p, soared above 400p before closing at 378p. It is the biggest first-day rise of any initial public offering (IPO) in London since Royal Mail shares soared by 38% on their debut in October. Some analysts warned that the high valuation, which works out more than five times its sales, is reminiscent of the dotcom bubble, which saw the value of technology companies soar in the late 1990s before crashing when the bubble burst in 2001. Richard Holway, the chairman of TechMarketView, said: \"To apply such stratospheric tech valuations to an online retailer really is risking the infamous bursting of the bubble.\" Nick Bubb, a veteran independent retail analyst, said the company's valuation \"seems somewhat excessive\". \"AO's excellent customer service has clearly excited investors, but AO has yet to prove that its recent success is sustainable or show that it can grow outside the UK,\" he said. \"It still has to compete in the UK with mighty Amazon, as well as the 'multi-channel' presence of Dixons, and it has yet to move into Europe.\" AO, which made sales of \u00a3275m last year, said it will spend the \u00a341m it made from the share sale to fund its expansion into Europe. Roberts has promised investors he will set up infrastructure, such as a warehouse and delivery network, to launch in Germany within 12 months of listing. Caunce said the firm's ambition is to become \"the leading electricals retailer across Europe\". The company, which was originally called Appliances Online, was started as a bet. \"Like all the best businesses, it started in the pub. It was Christmas Eve and I was having a drink with Alan Latchford, who is the L of [Ao.com's parent company] DRL. He bet me a pound I wouldn't do it,\" Roberts told Retail Week. Roberts said he hadn't heard of the internet when he started the company but Latchford had, and he was tasked with building the website before New Year's Eve. Roberts credits the company's success with its relentless focus on customer service. Call centre staff have the autonomy to despatch a new product on the day that customer call up with a complaint and can send a bunch of flowers without seeking a supervisor's approval. Staff are rewarded with intra-office table tennis tournaments, gym membership for \u00a32 a month and free chocolates and crisps. Roberts said free crisps cost the company \u00a350,000 last year. Despite his new wealth, Roberts has committed to staying with the company. \"We are not taking profits and running for the hills or refinancing our balance sheet to pay off debts,\" he said this month. I'm not going anywhere and there is passion and energy in this business. It is like my sixth child.\" AO has signed up Brian McBride, the chairman of online fashion retailer ASOS, as a senior non-executive in a bid to replicate the success of the web clothing business, which has seen its shares rise 2,000% in the past five years.",

But after several hours of talks between visiting mission chiefs representing the EU, ECB and IMF and Greece\u2019s central bank governor George Provopoulos, word emerged this evening that while amicable nothing had been agreed and further discussions would now be necessary. </p> <p>Finance ministry officials confirmed that technical teams representing the debt-stricken country\u2019s troika of creditors would meet with central bank officials in the coming days before Provopoulos and troika mission heads met again next week. </p> <p>Privately, bankers said the break-down showed the depth of disagreement between Athens and foreign lenders not only over the recapitisation requirements of the country\u2019s four leading banks but the sheer scale of non-performing loans held by them.</p> <p> \u201cThere is a vast divergence of views that frankly does not bode well,\u201d said one well-placed banker who is regularly briefed by troika officials. \u201cWith non-performing loans now in excess of 30% and possibly as high as 35%, the capital base of banks is being eaten into so they will need an extra injection of cash to cope with that and the overall restructuring of the sector. We are not out of the woods yet but the Greek government seems to be blind to the problems that lie ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Non performing loans are now the focus of a health check currently being undertaken on lenders by the country\u2019s central bank. But after the dissolution of talks today, insiders say the results of the stress tests would now be delayed until the end of next week. This latest hiccup will deflate the news earlier today of the yields on Greek bonds reaching their lowest level since Athens triggered Europe\u2019s debt crisis in October 2009. </p> </blockquote>  <p><i><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/26/uk-gdp-data-growth-live?view=desktop#block-530deabbe4b01ebb627b6861\">As covered earlier</a></i></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-179b60b3-b8dc-4be8-b017-0b6bb3bbb483\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/26/1393434644949/728cc077-5b8b-490a-8b55-4fef8971f3f8-460x316.png\" alt=\"Greek 10-year bond yields\" width=\"460\" height=\"316\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek 10-year bond yields Photograph: /Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-02-26T17:11:17.553Z\">at 5.11pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-530e1c49e4b0b98ea1ee7383\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-26T17:00:18.900Z\">5.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IMF has also given Ghana the hurry-up, warning that it needs to make further spending cuts to bring its deficit - which broke through the 10% of GDP mark last year - into line:</p> <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> <ul> <li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">IMF SAYS GHANA\u2019S 2013 GDP GREW AT 5.5 PCT, LOWER THAN GOVERNMENT\u2019S PREDICTED GROWTH FIGURE OF 8 PCT</span></li> <li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">IMF SAYS REVENUE SHORTFALL, WAGE OVERRUN PUSHED GHANA\u2019S 2013 DEFICT TO 10.9 PCT, HIGHER THAN REVISED GOVT FIGURE OF 10.8 PCT</span></li> <li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">GHANA\u2019S 2014 FISCAL DEFICIT TARGET OF 8.5 PCT IS AT RISK - IMF</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> </span></li> <li><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">IMF </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">SAYS GHANA NEEDS ADDITIONAL FISCAL SAVINGS TO REDUCE PUBLIC DEBT LEVELS AND INTEREST RATES</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> </span></li> </ul></span> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-530e122be4b01ebb627b6895\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-26T16:36:11.690Z\">4.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Looking back at <b><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2014/sdn1402.pdf\">the International Monetary Fund\u2019s staff note on inequality</a></b> -- its authors say they have built on previous work that found: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>...inequality can undermine progress in health and education, cause investment-reducing political and economic instability, and undercut the social consensus required to adjust in the face of shocks, and thus that it tends to reduce the pace and durability of growth. </p> </blockquote> <p>And they conclude that there is an \u201curgent\u201d need for more work on the issue.</p> <p>And while they are cautious about reading <b>too much</b> into their work, their conclusion is pretty striking:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On average, across countries and over time, the things that governments have typically done to redistribute do not seem to have led to bad growth outcomes, unless they were extreme. </p> <p>And the resulting narrowing of inequality helped support faster and more durable growth, apart from ethical, political, or broader social considerations.</p> </blockquote> <p><i>Could be a game-changer...</i></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-530e100be4b0b98ea1ee736e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-26T16:11:10.322Z\">4.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Speaking of inequality.... the UK\u2019s minimum wage is likely to rise by 3% in October, ahead of inflation for the first time since the financial crisis began.</b></p> <p>Business secretary Vince Cable has told MPs that Low Pay Commission has recommended raising the minimum wage to \u00a36.50 per hour.</p> <p>Unions has welcomed the news.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. A quick summary: Britain\u2019s economy grew by 0.7% in the last three months of 2013, with a rise in business investment bolstering hopes that the recovery is becoming more balanced. Summary here. The news came at 9.30am from the Office for National Statistics. The International Monetary Fund has released a staff study, which found that inequality is bad for growth - and that redistribution does not hamper economic expansion. Details start here. The UK\u2019s minimum wage is likely to rise 3% in October, to \u00a36.50 per hour. French unemployment has hit a new record high. Talks in Greece between the Troika and the central bank over recapitalisating the country\u2019s commercial banks ended without agreement. Here\u2019s the latest. Unemployment in France has hit a fresh record high, in another reminder of president Francois Hollande\u2019s failure to get to grips with the jobless crisis. The French labour ministry reported that the number of people out of work rose by 0.3% in January to 3,316,200, the highest level since records began in 1996. Hollande had vowed that unemployment would start falling before the end of 2013 -- a goal that is now two months late, and counting.... Ahead of its financial results tomorrow, Royal Bank of Scotland has told the City it is selling its 28% stake in Direct Line, the insurance firm. Here\u2019s the statement. RBS\u2019s results could reignite the ongoing row over bank bonus payments. Here\u2019s what Cathy Jamieson MP, Labour\u2019s shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said tonight: \u201cTaxpayers will be staggered if huge bonuses continue to be paid out at a time when significant losses are being made. \u201cGeorge Osborne should make clear he will reject any request from RBS to increase the bank bonus cap so bonuses worth more than 100 per cent of salary can be paid. \u201cWith bumper bonuses continuing this year across a number of banks, the government should also be repeating Labour\u2019s successful tax on bank bonuses this year. This could fund a paid job for every young person out of work for 12 months or more, which they would have to take up or lose benefits.\u201d And back over to Greece where the issue of bank recapitalization has dominated talks between visiting troika auditors and the Greek government today. Helena Smith reports: It was meant to be the meeting that would finally end the controversy encircling the refinancing needs of Greek banks. But after several hours of talks between visiting mission chiefs representing the EU, ECB and IMF and Greece\u2019s central bank governor George Provopoulos, word emerged this evening that while amicable nothing had been agreed and further discussions would now be necessary. Finance ministry officials confirmed that technical teams representing the debt-stricken country\u2019s troika of creditors would meet with central bank officials in the coming days before Provopoulos and troika mission heads met again next week. Privately, bankers said the break-down showed the depth of disagreement between Athens and foreign lenders not only over the recapitisation requirements of the country\u2019s four leading banks but the sheer scale of non-performing loans held by them. \u201cThere is a vast divergence of views that frankly does not bode well,\u201d said one well-placed banker who is regularly briefed by troika officials. \u201cWith non-performing loans now in excess of 30% and possibly as high as 35%, the capital base of banks is being eaten into so they will need an extra injection of cash to cope with that and the overall restructuring of the sector. We are not out of the woods yet but the Greek government seems to be blind to the problems that lie ahead.\u201d Non performing loans are now the focus of a health check currently being undertaken on lenders by the country\u2019s central bank. But after the dissolution of talks today, insiders say the results of the stress tests would now be delayed until the end of next week. This latest hiccup will deflate the news earlier today of the yields on Greek bonds reaching their lowest level since Athens triggered Europe\u2019s debt crisis in October 2009. As covered earlier The IMF has also given Ghana the hurry-up, warning that it needs to make further spending cuts to bring its deficit - which broke through the 10% of GDP mark last year - into line: IMF SAYS GHANA\u2019S 2013 GDP GREW AT 5.5 PCT, LOWER THAN GOVERNMENT\u2019S PREDICTED GROWTH FIGURE OF 8 PCT IMF SAYS REVENUE SHORTFALL, WAGE OVERRUN PUSHED GHANA\u2019S 2013 DEFICT TO 10.9 PCT, HIGHER THAN REVISED GOVT FIGURE OF 10.8 PCT GHANA\u2019S 2014 FISCAL DEFICIT TARGET OF 8.5 PCT IS AT RISK - IMF IMF SAYS GHANA NEEDS ADDITIONAL FISCAL SAVINGS TO REDUCE PUBLIC DEBT LEVELS AND INTEREST RATES Looking back at the International Monetary Fund\u2019s staff note on inequality -- its authors say they have built on previous work that found: ...inequality can undermine progress in health and education, cause investment-reducing political and economic instability, and undercut the social consensus required to adjust in the face of shocks, and thus that it tends to reduce the pace and durability of growth. And they conclude that there is an \u201curgent\u201d need for more work on the issue. And while they are cautious about reading too much into their work, their conclusion is pretty striking: On average, across countries and over time, the things that governments have typically done to redistribute do not seem to have led to bad growth outcomes, unless they were extreme. And the resulting narrowing of inequality helped support faster and more durable growth, apart from ethical, political, or broader social considerations. Could be a game-changer... Speaking of inequality.... the UK\u2019s minimum wage is likely to rise by 3% in October, ahead of inflation for the first time since the financial crisis began. Business secretary Vince Cable has told MPs that Low Pay Commission has recommended raising the minimum wage to \u00a36.50 per hour. Unions has welcomed the news. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u201cThis is a welcome increase in the minimum wage, which starts to recover some of the ground it has lost since 2008. \u201cWe hope this is the first in a series of bolder increases that will give real help to the low paid, and not just a pre-election boost.\u201d Employers seem content too. Dr Adam Marshall, executive director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cThe Low Pay Commission has to tread a careful balance, recommending changes to the minimum wage that help low-paid employees without undermining employers\u2019 ability to generate jobs and growth. \u201cAs the economy continues to improve, businesses agree that the minimum wage must rise. In recent polling, sixty percent of Chamber members supported an increase in line with current inflation, and fourteen percent favoured an above-inflation increase. After years of pay restraint, companies now feel somewhat more confident when it comes to the question of pay. \u201cSo while the Low Pay Commission\u2019s recommendation appears to be slightly higher than many employers had hoped, it represents a reasonable compromise. Oxfam has thrown its weight behind the IMF staff note on inequality (see 3.45pm) -- arguing that the researchers are right to conclude that inequality is bad for growth, and that it is possible to redistribute wealth without undermining growth. Nicolas Mombrial, head of the anti-poverty charity\u2019s Washington Office, declared that the research should encourage the IMF to stop pushing austerity: \u201cOxfam agrees with the IMF \u2013 extreme inequality is damaging not only because it is morally unacceptable, but it\u2019s bad economics.\u201d \u201cThe IMF has debunked the old myth that redistribution is bad for growth and demolished the case for austerity. That redistribution efforts -essential to fight inequality- are good for growth is a welcome finding. Low tax and low public spending are clearly not the route to prosperity.\u201d \u201cThis is a green light for governments to use fair tax systems and investments in health and education to reduce damaging income inequality.\u201d \u201cIn the bad old days, the IMF asked governments to cut public spending and taxes. We hope this research and Christine Lagarde\u2019s recent statements are a sign that they are changing their tune.\u201d Last month, Oxfam warned that the richest 85 people in the world control as much wealth as the poorest 50% of the global population. The International Monetary Fund has issued a research paper which warns that income inequality is bad for growth, and argued that it is possible to redistribute wealth without any impact on economic expansion rates. It\u2019s an important contribution to an issue that has rattled up the agenda in both politics and economics -- even the World Economic Forum made it a priority at Davos last month. The IMF note, called Redistribution, Inequality, and Growth (online here) found that countries with high levels of inequality suffered lower growth than nations that distributed incomes more evenly. It also warned that inequality can also make growth more volatile and create the unstable conditions for a sudden slowdown in GDP growth. It was written by Jonathan Ostry, the deputy head of the IMF\u2019s research department, and the economists Andrew Berg and Charalambos Tsangarides. They said: \u201cWe find that higher inequality seems to lower growth. Redistribution, in contrast, has a tiny and statistically insignificant (slightly negative) effect.\u201d The research note makes three key points: more unequal societies tend to redistribute more. lower net inequality is robustly correlated with faster and more durable growth, for a given level of redistribution redistribution appears generally benign in terms of its impact on growth; only in extreme cases is there some evidence that it may have direct negative effects on growth. Here\u2019s the full story: IMF study finds inequality is damaging to economic growth Reaction to follow.... Here\u2019s a surprise - new home sales in America hit a five and a half-year high last month, defying fears that bad winter weather would hit demand. The Commerce Department reported a 9.6% jump in sales last month, beating estimates, taking the annual rate to 468,000 -- the highest since July 2008. Back to the UK growth data....Mark Gregory, transaction partner and chief economist at EY, says it shows firms are more confident, and in a good position to spend: \u201cCompanies have weathered a prolonged period of uncertainty during which time they strengthened their balance sheets and optimised their capital structures. Having warehoused cash for a number of years, and with ready access to credit, leading UK corporates are in a strong financial position to do deals \u2013 they now have more confidence to pull the trigger - and this is evidenced today\u2019s positive GDP figures highlighting sustained business investment.\u201d Familiar scenes in Athens today -- dock workers marched in front of the parliament building to protest at plans to privatise some of the country\u2019s ports, during a 24-hour strike. AP has the story: Greek dock workers across the country walked off the job on Wednesday in a 24-hour strike to protest plans to sell a stake in the Piraeus Port Authority, the country\u2019s largest port. Hundreds of striking port workers gathered in central Athens and marched to Parliament for a protest rally. Nearby, protesting farmers\u2019 market suppliers demonstrated outside the Finance Ministry against higher taxes. Both rallies ended peacefully. Privatizing state-held assets is a key part of Greece\u2019s international bailout agreement, under which the country has received billions of dollars in rescue loans from its partners in the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund since May 2010. In return, it has had to implement wide-ranging economic reforms and austerity measures, such as cuts to pensions and salaries as well as tax increases. Its privatization drive, however, has lagged far behind original deadlines. Wednesday\u2019s port workers\u2019 strike was timed to coincide with a Parliament discussion on the Piraeus stake sale. Greece\u2019s sovereign debt has strengthened in value today, as talks continue between government ministers and officials and its Troika of lenders over the country\u2019s bailout programme. This has driven down the interest rate, or yield, on 10-year Greek bonds to just 7.2% -- the lowest level since March 2010. Shares are also rallying in Athens, pushing the main index up 3.3%, on optimism that the two sides will reach a deal to unlock the next loan tranche. The rally comes as the Troika meets with Greece\u2019s central bank governor, to discuss how much fresh capital must be pumped into bank stocks. The Greek government reckons \u20ac6bn is needed -- on Monday, the Financial Times claimed that this is a serious underestimate, and that three times as much may be required. We should have more on this later.... This morning\u2019s GDP data didn\u2019t prevent the FTSE 100 index dropping again today, further away from Monday\u2019s 14-year closing high. The blue-chip index is down 32 points, or 0.5%, at 6797. Tesco is the biggest faller, down 4.2%, as investors fail to be impressed by its new strategy of price wars and cutting back on new stores. Our news story on today\u2019s GDP data, by Angela Monaghan, is here: UK economic growth for 2013 revised down to 1.8% Britain\u2019s economy grew at a slightly slower rate than previously thought in 2013, but economists welcomed signs that growth was more balanced in the final three months of the year. Gross domestic product increased by 1.8% last year compared with an earlier estimate of 1.9% after growth in both the first and second quarters was revised down by 0.1 percentage points by the Office for National Statistics. However it was still the strongest annual rate of growth since 2007, when the economy grew by 3.4% before the financial crisis. On a quarterly basis, the ONS confirmed the economy grew by 0.7% in the fourth quarter, unchanged from its first estimate published last month. Details showed a lesser dependence on consumer spending than previous quarters, which, combined with a rise in exports and business investment, was good news for UK policymakers seeking a move away from a economy reliant on debt-fuelled household spending. David Cameron said it was \u201cmore encouraging news\u201d that the government\u2019s long-term economic plan was working. More here. Time for a quick recap. A pick-up in UK business investment has raised hopes that Britain\u2019s recovery from recession is broadening and becoming more balanced, but the economy is further from its pre-crisis peak than first thought. The Office for National Statistics reported this morning that UK GDP rose by 0.7% in the final quarter of 2013, in line with the first estimate last month. However, revisions to previous data mean the UK only grew by 1.8 during 2013, down from 1.9%. Encouragingly, today\u2019s data showed that business investment increased by 2.4% in the quarter - and was up nearly 9% on a year ago. This shows firms are spending more on equipment and infrastructure, after a year in which consumer spending has provided the impetus to economic growth. Business leader welcomed the news. David Kern of the British Chambers of Commerce said it would \u201cunderpin business confidence\u201d, but added that more needs to be done to secure the recovery: However, it is now important to improve the quality of Britain\u2019s recovery. While it is encouraging that consumer spending is growing, we need to rely more on investment and net exports. City analysts agreed that the UK recovery was broadening out. Samuel Combs of Capital Economics said it was \u201cpicking up strongly\u201d The expenditure breakdown shows that the recovery is now less dependent on consumer spending However, the ONS also revised down its first estimate for manufacturing growth to +0.7%, from +0.9%. There was better news for construction, though. Output rose by 0.2%, rather than shrinking by 0.1% as first thought. The service sector rose by 0.8%, in line with the initial estimate. Allan Monks of JP Morgan has hailed today\u2019s data as evidence that the UK has taken \u201ca significant step\u201d towards a more balanced recovery. A steady acceleration in business investment is underway, he points out (up over 8% during 2013, with the ONS revising data from earlier quarters). A Treasury spokesman has warned that Britain\u2019s recovery is not complete, despite confirmation that growth remained steady at 0.7% last quarter: \u201cAs the Chancellor said last week the recovery is not yet secure. \u201cThe Budget next month will do more to support investment and exports, and the biggest risk to the recovery would be abandoning the plan that\u2019s providing economic security for hardworking people.\u201d Missed this earlier -- the prime minister tweeted about the GDP data: This chart shows how household consumption, business investment and trade all made positive contributions to economic growth: Rob Wood of Berenberg says the 2.4% rise in UK business investment in the last quarter shows the recovery is less reliant on householder consumption: The UK recovery is broadening as rising confidence gets firms investing again. Wood thinks growth will accelerate, but warns that some elements of the GDP data are negative: Though consumption growth slowed, it probably still outpaced meagre income gains. Wage earnings rose only 0.5% qoq in Q4, so the saving rate probably fell again. Further falls in household saving are likely over the coming years. The economic story here is that low interest rates, falling uncertainty and improving credit availability are encouraging households to spend instead of saving and getting firms investing again. These data signal that monetary policy is increasingly getting traction. The recovery is likely to gain momentum through 2014 and 2015. We forecast growth of 3.0% in 2014, rising to 3.3% in 2015. Here\u2019s a snapshot of the key points in today\u2019s GDP data (reminder, the full report is online here). Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank welcomes the rise in business investment: Business investment rose by 2.4% q/q following 2% q/q in Q3. That is a very healthy pace and long may it continue. But he urges caution on the trade figures: Net exports provided a decent addition to growth as expected. However, this was more because of lower imports than stronger exports. Really, we would prefer it to be the other way around i.e. stronger exports in the driving seat. Samuel Combs of Capital Economics argues that today\u2019s data shows the UK recovery is a little more sustainable: The expenditure breakdown shows that the recovery is now less dependent on consumer spending, which rose by just 0.4% q/q [graph]. In contrast, both overall and business investment rose by a chunky 2.4%. With investment now picking up strongly, the recovery is unlikely to hit the buffers and generate inflation soon. Meanwhile, net trade contributed 0.4 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth, thanks to a combination of rising exports and falling imports. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says today\u2019s revisions paint a \u201cmixed picture\u201d. He\u2019s encouraged that business investment is up, and that net trade made a positive contribution to GDP growth. But also concerned that growth was weaker than expected in early 2013 (graph): \u201cOverall, these figures will underpin business confidence. However, it is now important to improve the quality of Britain\u2019s recovery. While it is encouraging that consumer spending is growing, we need to rely more on investment and net exports. These figures show a small move in the right direction, but there is still more to do. There are some signs that the UK economy is rebalancing away from consumer spending, argues Neil Prothero, deputy chief economist at EFF (the manufacturers\u2019 organisation): \u201cWhile household spending was again the main driver of activity there was an encouraging uptick in business investment and a small positive contribution from net exports.\u201d UK household consumption rose by 0.4% in the October-December quarter -- the ninth rise in a row, but not as strong as the City had expected. Ben Chu of the Independent tweets a helpful graph showing that the ONS revised down its GDP estimates for the first six months of last year. That\u2019s why the annual growth rate last quarter was cut to +1.8% rather than +1.9%. Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector did not grow as rapidly as first thought in the last three months of 2013. The ONS has revised down its estimate of manufacturing output growth to +0.7%, down from the initial forecast of +0.9%. That\u2019s slightly slower than in the third quarter, as this graph shows: That\u2019s a little disappointing - I remember George Osborne tweeting last month that manufacturing was leading the recovery. The UK\u2019s dominant service sector growth grew by 0.8%, the same as in Q3 (and unchanged from the first estimate). On a brighter note, construction output has been revised up to +0.2% rise, from a 0.1% decline initially. But output of the agriculture, forestry &amp; fishing industries fell by 0.1% between Q3 and Q4 2013, revised down from the previously estimated 0.5% increase. Some early reaction: But... Today\u2019s GDP data is also a reminder that the UK economy suffered a stomach-churning drop in activity when the global recession struck, and has still not reached its pre-crisis peak. The failure to bounce back in 2011 and 2012 means it\u2019s the slowest recovery in decades, as this chart shows (the zero on the y-axis is the GDP level before each recession). The UK Treasury team was quick to point out that firms are spending almost 9% more on new equipment and offices than a year ago: This looks encouraging -- \u2018gross fixed capital formation (in basic terms, this includes firms buying new equipment for their production process) rose by 2.4% in the final quarter of 2013. This shows firms spend more on new buildings and structures, and various machinery and equipment, the ONS said. Here\u2019s the key graph: The Office for Statistics second estimate at UK GDP for the last three months of 2013 is online here. Here\u2019s the \u201ckey findings\u201d: UK gross domestic product (GDP) in volume terms was estimated to have increased by 0.7% between Q3 2013 and Q4 2013, unrevised from the Preliminary Estimate of GDP published 28 January 2014. GDP is estimated to have increased by 1.8% in 2013, compared with 2012, revised down 0.1 percentage points from the previously estimated 1.9% increase. Between Q4 2012 and Q4 2013 GDP in volume terms increased by 2.7%, revised down 0.1 percentage points from the previously estimated 2.8% increase. GDP in current prices was estimated to have increased by 1.9% between Q3 2013 and Q4 2013. Reuters snaps the key points: UK Q4 HOUSEHOLD SPENDING +0.4% QQ, GOVT SPENDING +0.3% QQ UK Q4 SERVICES OUTPUT +0.8% QQ, CONSTRUCTION +0.2% QQ UK Q4 INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT +0.5% QQ, MANUFACTURING OUTPUT +0.7% QQ ONS SAYS HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURE, GROSS FIXED CAPITAL FORMATION INCLUDING BUSINESS INVESTMENT, NET TRADE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO Q4 GROWTH Breaking: The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2013, in line with the first estimate. But the annual growth rate was revised down to 2.7%, from a previous estimate of 2.8%. More to follow ..... More on this later... Nearly time for the UK GDP data! Jeremy Cook of World First, the foreign exchange dealer, reckons there\u2019s a chance that the Office for National Statistics will revise up its assessment that the UK grew by 0.7% in the last quarter. Cook is also keen to see the details of today\u2019s release, including the exports and business investment components of the UK economy Today sees the first revision to Q4\u2032s UK GDP number of 0.7% with the market happy to see no change at 09.30 GMT. Upside surprises are possible once December\u2019s retail sales rocket-ship number of a 2.6% increase are folded into the calculations. We will also receive a better breakdown of growth at this iteration and while consumption will have contributed the lion\u2019s share we will look to see what effect business investment has had. This confidence will be the lifeblood of the new recovery. Exports will also be interesting to watch to see if the recent strength of the pound has had a negative effect. Ukraine\u2019s currency, the hryvnia, just hit a fresh record low of 10 to the US dollar, after falling another 3.5% this morning. It has now lost a quarter of its value so far this year, and has been tumbling in value as citizens try to withdraw savings and convert into the US dollar. Speculation that Ukraine could default on its loans, if an aid package can\u2019t be agreed, have also hit the hryvnia. The latest slump comes as concern grows over the future of Crimea. Last night, Ukraine\u2019s interim president warned that the country faces a serious threat from separatism, while one Russian politician said Moscow would act to protect the \u201clife and health of our compatriots\u201d in the region, if necessary. Here\u2019s the full story. Swiss bank UBS has just increased its growth forecasts for this year and 2015, flags up Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever: Speaking of interest rates (see here), some Tory backbenchers want George Osborne to announce pre-election tax cuts in next month\u2019s budget to head off the risk of a rate hike during next year\u2019s election campaign (Britain goes to the polls in May next year). Mark Garnier and David Ruffley, both members of the Treasury committee, told the FT they fear Osborne could get the blame if the Bank of England raises borrowing costs. Ruffley dubbed it a \u201cpolitical iceberg\u201d heading their way. George Osborne under pressure to cut UK taxes as rate rise looms There are, obviously, worries that a rate rise will hurt over-extended households. But the Bank has been been pretty clear that it won\u2019t act until the UK economy looks stronger -- and probably not until real wages are rising. Osborne will be able to argue that a rise in interest rates shows a return to normality -- and might even win him some votes from savers. Still, Tory MPs like little more than a tax cut..... The big news overnight was that another European bank, Credit Suisse, is in hot water with the US authorities. Senators accused Credit Suisse of costing US taxpayers billions of dollars through various activities straight out of a spy novel, in an official report into offshore tax schemes. Senior executives are due at the Senate later today to answer the charges - and its shares have already fallen almost 2% this morning. Here\u2019s a flavour of the report According to the report, bankers filed false visa applications pretending they were tourists, and conducted business at sponsored golf events. One customer told the investigation that his bank statements were passed to him over a business breakfast hidden inside a copy of Sports Illustrated. US clients who visited the bank in Switzerland were whisked to meetings in a button-less, remote controlled elevator. Once they arrived, they would be advised on the best way to circumvent US tax laws, said Senator Carl Levin. More here: Credit Suisse \u2018cloak-and-dagger\u2019 tactics cost US taxpayers billions \u2013 senators The report is already causing quite a splash: Two members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee have assured the nation that the Bank isn\u2019t planning to raise interest rates any time soon, even though the UK economy is growing at a decent pace (we\u2019ll find out just how fast in an hour\u2019s time). David Miles told the BBC that recent falls in inflation, to 1.9%, mean less pressure to raise borrowing costs: \u201cAt the moment [our aim] is not to increase interest rates in the very near term, because we have got inflation at target, it looks like it is going to stay there, and there is plenty of scope to encourage strong demand in the economy\u201d And Spencer Dale, chief economist, took to the radio waves to declare: \u201cWe\u2019re not planning to raise interest rates any time soon.\u201d \u201dInterest rates will have to rise at some point but not yet. And when they do they will rise very gradually and cautiously to make sure we continue to nurture the recovery we have seen in output growth and employment. A third MPC member, Ben Broadbent, is giving a speech in London this morning. And a fourth, Ian McCafferty, suggested yesterday that a rate rise could come in spring 2015. It\u2019s always nice to hear from the MPC, of course -- just hope they left someone behind at Threadneedle Street to run the Bank.... Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics reckons today\u2019s GDP report, due at 9.30am GMT, will confirm the UK grew by 0.7% in the last quarter of 2013. He also expects some signs that the recovery widened: The second estimate of Q4 GDP seems unlikely to revise quarterly growth from the 0.7% provisional figure reported by the ONS last month. Admittedly, the second estimate often surprises \u2013 since the first quarter of 2005, it has been different to the first nearly two-thirds of the time. But the latest industrial production and construction output figures released since the initial estimate of GDP provide no basis for expecting a revision. Meanwhile, the expenditure breakdown of GDP is likely to show that the recovery has broadened, with net trade and investment both making positive contributions to overall growth in the fourth quarter. But Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reckons there\u2019s an \u201coutside chance\u201d of an upward adjustment to 0.8% from 0.7%, because December\u2019s retail sales numbers were strong. He\u2019s not confident that firms actually boosted their investment spending, though: More important for the markets though is some indication that businesses are starting to feel more confident about the economic outlook and feel more confident about boosting investment and capital expenditure. Ideally we would like to see an improvement on business investment, however expectations are for a slight decline from the previous 2% to 1.3%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, economics, business and the eurozone. The UK economy is centre stage today, with the release of revised GDP data for the final three months of last year. The figures, due at 9.30am, will confirm whether or not Britain\u2019s economy grew at 0.7% in the October-December quarter, as first estimated last month. There\u2019s a small chance it might be revised up, which would doubtless be cheered in Downing Street - and raise the pressure on the Bank of England over the timing of an interest rate rise. The GDP report will also provide a better picture of how the economy performed in Q4, including details of UK trade, and how much firms spent on business investment and capital expenditure. If they went up, it might show that UK PLC is finally feeling more optimistic about the state of the economy, and making the investments needed to drive the economy on. If they didn\u2019t, concerns that the recovery is unbalanced, and propped up by consumer spending, will grow. Also coming up today -- a series of Bank of England policymakers are giving interviews today, which could give some insight into how long the Bank will hold interest rates at record lows. I\u2019ll round up the key points shortly. And the UK energy firms are being forced to publish wholesale energy prices, in a bid to raise competition. Plenty of corporate news around, including a 39% surge in operating profits at householder Taylor Wimpey as it sells more new homes at higher prices. More on that shortly.... But bakery firm Greggs has seen profits slump 19%. And we\u2019ll be watching Greece, where talks continue with the Troika over its bailout programme....",

      "bodyText": "Senators have called on the US justice department to force the Swiss banking group Credit Suisse to hand over the names of thousands of US citizens who used its accounts to evade taxes. At a heated hearing of the permanent subcommittee on investigations on Wednesday the Democratic senator Carl Levin blamed the bank, the Swiss government and the justice department for allowing close to 22,000 US citizens to get away with hiding $12bn (\u00a37bn) from the taxman in Swiss bank accounts. On Tuesday the committee had released a 178-page report documenting how Credit Suisse helped US citizens escape taxes using systems which the Republican senator John McCain said were like something out of \"a spy novel\". According to the report, bankers filed false visa applications pretending they were tourists and drummed up business at sponsored golf events. One customer's bank statements were passed to him hidden inside a copy of Sports Illustrated. Clients who visited the bank in Switzerland were whisked to meetings in a button-less, remote-controlled lift where they were advised on the best way to circumvent US tax laws. About 1,800 Credit Suisse staff worked on the accounts, but only 10 people have been disciplined and none had been sacked, the committee heard. The Credit Suisse chief executive, Brady Dougan, told the senators that he was blocked by Swiss law from disclosing the names to the US authorities. \"So any real idea that the [Swiss] government is co-operating with us is a joke,\" said McCain, the subcommittee's ranking Republican member.

      "bodyText": "Tesco is under fire from farmers after cutting the amount of British beef it bought last year despite promising to source closer to home in the wake of the horsemeat scandal. The UK's biggest supermarket bought nearly 8% less British beef in November 2013 than it did a year earlier despite taking out full-page advertisements 12 months ago saying: \"We know that the more we work with British farmers the better.\" The findings came from a National Farmers Union (NFU) report card on the progress of the UK's biggest grocers, which all said they wanted to buy more in Britain in order to keep a closer eye on their suppliers after horsemeat was found in burgers and ready meals stocked in Tesco, Aldi and Asda. Tesco was the most criticised supermarket in the report, with seven areas of improvement compared with two each for Morrisons and the Co-op, five for Asda and four for Sainsbury's. Morrisons may be under pressure from shareholders amid struggling with falling sales and profits, but the NFU said the Bradford-based supermarket was a \"shining example of commitment to British-produced food\", as it sourced the vast majority of its own-label meat from the UK as well as milk and eggs. While Tesco has achieved its aim of sourcing all fresh chicken in the UK, as promised in its adverts a year ago, the report says the supermarket has not set a timetable for its aim of putting British chicken in all its ready meals and has not even set an \"aspiration\" to source 100% British lamb in season. \"Tesco's public commitments to source more of its food closer to home do raise expectations that a concerted effort is being made to increase the amount of British produce sourced,\" the report said. The supermarket was subject to particular scrutiny after its chief executive, Philip Clarke, promised farmers a much closer relationship at last year's NFU conference. Phil Hudson, the head of food and farming at the NFU, said: \"Tesco has made some progress but we want to see that progress accelerate in terms of the commitments made by Phil Clarke made a year ago. If you come to the NFU conference and make commitments clearly you can be expected to hold to them.\" However, Tesco said it did not recognise the 8% fall in its purchase of British beef highlighted by the NFU and that all its beef was sourced in either the UK or Ireland, which customers did not differentiate between. The supermarket added that, as a result of sourcing all its fresh chicken in the UK, it now bought 20,000 tonnes more British chicken a year. A spokesman said: \"We are proud to be British agriculture's biggest customer and are continually strengthening our relationships with our farmers and growers. We have made good progress which has been well received, and have already met the specific commitments we made last year.-quality, affordable food, we will always be driven by our customers.\" Asda was also marked down by the NFU for sourcing 1% less British lamb in November last year compared with a year before. Although the Walmart-owned chain did increase the amount of British beef it bought last year by 6%, it commits to buying only milk and eggs entirely in the UK. The NFU challenged Asda to source all its beef, chicken and pork in the UK, as do Sainsbury's, Morrisons and the Co-op. Asda said all its whole chickens were 100% British. A spokeswoman added: \"At Asda, we are supportive of the British farming industry and we always aim to source British meat first.\" Sainsbury's already commits to buy all its milk, eggs, pork and fresh chicken in the UK and 100% lamb in the UK in season. It buys all its beef in either the UK or Ireland. However the NFU said it had failed to make clear how it would measure and achieve its stated objective of doubling the amount of British food in stores by 2020. Justin King, the Sainsbury's chief executive, said on Tuesday that the target was measured from a 2010 baseline but admitted that the supermarket had no specific definition of how the target would be measured. He said it could be reached by either increasing the volume of food bought in Britain or by increasing the value of that food from the \u00a34bn bought in 2010, although he admitted basing it on value would be slightly spurious given the effect of inflation.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has backed economists who argue that inequality is a drag on growth in a discussion paper that has also dismissed rightwing theories that efforts to redistribute incomes are self-defeating. The Washington-based organisation, which advises governments on sustainable growth, said countries with high levels of inequality suffered lower growth than nations that distributed incomes more evenly. Backing analysis by the Keynesian economist and Nobel prizewinner Joseph Stiglitz, it warned that inequality can also make growth more volatile and create the unstable conditions for a sudden slowdown in GDP growth. And in what is likely to be viewed as its most controversial conclusion, the IMF said analysis of various efforts to redistribute incomes showed they had a neutral effect on GDP growth. This last point is expected to dismay rightwing politicians who argue that overcoming inequality robs the rich of incentives to invest and the poor of incentives to work and is counter-productive. The paper, written by Jonathan Ostry, the deputy head of the IMF's research department, and the economists Andrew Berg and Charalambos Tsangarides, comes after several years of heated debate over the path that developed and developing countries' economies have taken since the financial crash and whether their recoveries are sustainable. Anti-poverty charity Oxfam welcomed the report, saying it shows \"extreme inequality is damaging not only because it is morally unacceptable, but it's bad economics\". It added: \"The IMF has debunked the old myth that redistribution is bad for growth and demolished the case for austerity. That redistribution efforts -essential to fight inequality- are good for growth is a welcome finding. Low tax and low public spending are clearly not the route to prosperity.\" It is 18 months since the IMF published its controversial view that government cuts to public-sector spending were having a larger detrimental effect than previously thought. The paper, written by its chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, was incendiary and sparked denials in London and Brussels where calls for austerity were strongest. Heated debate over Blanchard's analysis has continued ever since, with many economists claiming that assumptions used in the critique were flawed. The authors of this latest report can expect the same backlash, especially in the US where the Tea Party has defended tax cuts for wealthy individuals and studies show most of the country's income growth since the crash has gone to the richest 1%. Last year the UK's coalition government cut tax on incomes over \u00a3150,000 from 50p to 45p after a debate over the negative effects on growth of high taxes on wealthy individuals. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has come under severe criticism for raising the tax on incomes above \u20ac1m to 75% from business groups that claim it will hit GDP and discourage wealthy investors from staying in France. The report's authors said the study, which excluded so-called market interference such as banker bonus caps and increases in welfare spending, showed the largest redistributions of income had negative effects on growth, but were offset by the benefits of lower inequality. \"We find that higher inequality seems to lower growth. Redistribution, in contrast, has a tiny and statistically insignificant (slightly negative) effect.\" They said the traditional view that efforts to redistribute incomes would have a corresponding and most likely detrimental effect on growth was unfounded. \"Rather than a trade-off, the average result across the sample is a win-win situation, in which redistribution has an overall pro-growth effect, counting both potential negative direct effects and positive effects of the resulting lower inequality,\" they said. In an interview later Ostry said it was his belief that the inclusion of higher welfare payments would only support the argument in favour of redistribution.",

    "webTitle": "Co-op Group to sell farms business and consider offloading pharmacy chain", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group has announced plans to sell its farms business and is considering a sale of its pharmacy chain as it faces a reported loss of more than \u00a32bn. Britain's biggest mutually owned company, which is preparing for its worst ever loss according to a BBC report on Wednesday morning, considers the farming business \u2013 the biggest in the UK \u2013 to be peripheral to its main activities and in need of investment. The network of 750 small pharmacy stores, which employs 6,500 staff, sits apart from the group's grocery operation and the group thinks it also requires investment to compete with rivals such as Alliance Boots. In a statement, the Co-op said: \"As part of the wider strategic review of all of its businesses, the Co-operative Group has decided that its farms are non-core and has started a process that is expected to lead to a sale of the business. In addition, it is exploring options for the future of the pharmacy business. This could include the sale in whole or part of the business.\" The chief executive, Euan Sutherland, who joined nine months ago, is reviewing the Co-op's entire business, which spans groceries, banking, funeral parlours and legal services. A \u00a31.5bn hole in the bank's capital requirements saw the group cede control of 70% of the bank to bondholders, led by US hedge funds. The wider group had \u00a31.2bn of debt at the end of its first half in July and is expecting further losses at its bank. The sale of both businesses will be an emotive subject for the most committed of the Co-op's eight million members, who view the 15 farms as a historic part of the company and the pharmaceutical arm as one of its most visible operations. Peter Hunt, the former general secretary of the Co-op political party, said: \"It's pretty shocking news. I think members will be dismayed to lose the pharmaceutical business in particular because it is so well known and has such a wide presence on the high street. The connection with the farms business is probably a bit more sentimental.\" The Co-op started buying farms in the late 19th century to ensure a supply of food for its grocery stores. In defending the sale, the Co-op will stress that 70% of production is cereals sold to other companies and that only 2%, mainly potatoes, goes to the group's stores. Phil Hudson, the head of food and farming at the National Farmers Union, said it would be difficult for the Co-op to claim it supports British agriculture if it sells the farms, which employ 200 people. \"It's disappointing that the Co-op has decided it needs to do this. Although it is looking at selling the farms as a going concern that could be an opportunity for farmers that want additional land or to get into farming, there's the potential for the loss of land to farming and agriculture.\" Activists are concerned about the way decisions are being made at a group that has been proud of its democratic credentials since it was founded by the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers in 1844. Jim Lee, a Co-operative member and activist for 25 years, said: \"The farms are part of history and the attitude that we had. If you couldn't get proper food supplies because there was an arrangement within the merchant classes then you started your own farms. In that sense it's no longer relevant but it shows how we used to deal with things but now we bow out very quickly. \"They are taking huge, huge decisions that change the shape of the co-operative movement without referring them beyond the board and that is worrying.\" Sutherland will give an update on his plans on 26 March when the Co-op announces its annual results. After a \u00a3559m loss in the first half, he told the Guardian last week that the annual numbers would be \"ugly\". The BBC reported that the group was heading for a \u00a32bn annual loss and that between 4,000 and 5,000 jobs would be cut in the next three years. The Co-op declined to comment beyond its statement. The loss is likely to have been caused by more problems at the Co-op Bank, which suffered a \u00a3779m loss in the first half mainly because of writedowns on loans from its merger with Britannia Building Society in early 2009. The group may also take further writedowns on the value of Somerfield, which it bought in 2008.",

The network of 750 small pharmacy stores, which employs 6,500 staff, sits apart from the group's grocery operation and the group thinks it also requires investment to compete with rivals such as Alliance Boots.</p> <p>In a statement, the Co-op said: \"As part of the wider strategic review of all of its businesses, the Co-operative Group has decided that its farms are non-core and has started a process that is expected to lead to a sale of the business. In addition, it is exploring options for the future of the pharmacy business. This could include the sale in whole or part of the business.\"</p> <p>The chief executive, Euan Sutherland, who joined nine months ago, is reviewing the Co-op's entire business, which spans groceries, banking, funeral parlours and legal services. A \u00a31.5bn hole in the bank's capital requirements saw the group cede control of 70% of the bank to bondholders, led by US hedge funds. The wider group had \u00a31.2bn of debt at the end of its first half in July and is expecting further losses at its bank.</p> <p>The sale of both businesses will be an emotive subject for the most committed of the Co-op's eight million members, who view the 15 farms as a historic part of the company and the pharmaceutical arm as one of its most visible operations.</p> <p>Peter Hunt, the former general secretary of the Co-op political party, said: \"It's pretty shocking news. I think members will be dismayed to lose the pharmaceutical business in particular because it is so well known and has such a wide presence on the high street. The connection with the farms business is probably a bit more sentimental.\"</p> <p>The Co-op started buying farms in the late 19th century to ensure a supply of food for its grocery stores. In defending the sale, the Co-op will stress that 70% of production is cereals sold to other companies and that only 2%, mainly potatoes, goes to the group's stores.</p> <p>Phil Hudson, the head of food and farming at the National Farmers Union, said it would be difficult for the Co-op to claim it supports British agriculture if it sells the farms, which employ 200 people.</p> <p>\"It's disappointing that the Co-op has decided it needs to do this. Although it is looking at selling the farms as a going concern that could be an opportunity for farmers that want additional land or to get into farming, there's the potential for the loss of land to farming and agriculture.\"</p> <p>Activists are concerned about the way decisions are being made at a group that has been proud of its democratic credentials since it was founded by the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers in 1844.</p> <p>Jim Lee, a Co-operative member and activist for 25 years, said: \"The farms are part of history and the attitude that we had. If you couldn't get proper food supplies because there was an arrangement within the merchant classes then you started your own farms. In that sense it's no longer relevant but it shows how we used to deal with things but now we bow out very quickly.</p> <p>\"They are taking huge, huge decisions that change the shape of the co-operative movement without referring them beyond the board and that is worrying.\"</p> <p>Sutherland will give an update on his plans on 26 March when the Co-op announces its annual results. After a \u00a3559m loss in the first half, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/21/co-operative-group-chief-euan-sutherland-political-donations-demutualisation\" title=\"\">he told the Guardian last week that the annual numbers would be \"ugly\"</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26350008\" title=\"\">The BBC reported</a> that the group was heading for a \u00a32bn annual loss and that between 4,000 and 5,000 jobs would be cut in the next three years. The Co-op declined to comment beyond its statement.</p> <p>The loss is likely to have been caused by more problems at the Co-op Bank, which suffered a \u00a3779m loss in the first half mainly because of writedowns on loans from its merger with Britannia Building Society in early 2009. The group may also take further writedowns on the value of Somerfield, which it bought in 2008.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Taylor Wimpey is paying \u00a3250m to shareholders after the government's Help to Buy scheme supported booming demand for the housebuilder's new properties. The company said it would pay out a special dividend to investors over the next two years from its growing cash pile. Taylor Wimpey made the pledge as it announced a 39% increase in operating profit to \u00a3313m. The company sold more homes at higher prices and increased its total order book by almost a third. It is the latest homebuilder to report booming business in Britain's revived property market. Persimmon and Bovis Homes have announced similarly buoyant figures as builders reap the rewards of looser bank lending and rising house prices. Barratt and Redrow report later this week. Taylor Wimpey said that 20% of its completed sales and 29% of agreed sales were supported by Help to Buy last year and that the chancellor's scheme had increased activity in the market. Help to Buy supports property buyers by underwriting or providing an interest-free loan for part of their mortgage. It has stoked demand and pushed up house prices though some economists believe it is fuelling a pre-election property bubble. Pete Redfern, Taylor Wimpey's chief executive, said: \"In a housing market showing significant recovery for the first time in five years, we have strongly improved our operating performance, increasing operating profits by 39%. \"Most importantly, we have continued to make significant investment for the future, adding to our short-term land bank and strategic land pipeline and increasing the level of training and development of staff, at all levels, from site trades to office technical roles.\" Taylor Wimpey said that it had benefited from snapping up desirable land at low prices in 2009 and that muted competition to buy meant it was still acquiring land at prices that would achieve healthy returns. Mortgage approvals for house purchases rose 57% in January to \u00a38bn \u2013 their highest level since the pre-crisis peak of the property market in September 2007. Mortgage lending has been helped by the Bank of England's Funding for Lending programme, though the Bank has refocused its funding assistance for banks away from mortgages to small businesses. Help to Buy's critics say that by pumping up the housing market it is stoking a bubble and has priced more people out of the market than it has helped. With big executive bonuses in the pipeline and companies returning cash to investors, some also argue that homebuilders' shareholders and executives are the biggest gainers from the taxpayer's backing. Taylor Wimpey shares were down 2.6% to 124.6p in early trading but have risen 10% over the past month.",

      "bodyText": "A government debt guarantee to Qantas would give the airline a \u201cleg-up\u201d worth at least $100m a year and would clearly amount to \u201cpicking winners\u201d, its rival carrier Virgin is arguing as it mounts a fierce last-minute lobbying effort against the plan. Federal cabinet has been seriously considering the emergency debt guarantee since last December and such a guarantee could be announced imminently as the national carrier prepares to reveal thousands of job losses and cost cutting with its semi-annual results on Thursday morning. But some senior ministers remain deeply sceptical about the plan, and on Wednesday West Australian Liberal backbencher, Senator Dean Smith, joined Brisbane Liberal backbencher Teresa Gambaro in expressing grave reservations. \u201cI am very sympathetic to Virgin\u2019s arguments. Consumers are benefiting from aviation competition and anything that undermines this is not welcome,\u201d Smith told Guardian Australia. Qantas is arguing that a debt facility would be offered as a measure of last resort on commercial terms and would therefore not come at a cost to the Commonwealth. But in its private briefings to ministers and backbenchers, Virgin is arguing the plan would come at a big cost to Qantas\u2019 competitors \u2013 and has quantified the value of the advantage at $100m per year. Virgin, whose credit rating is lower than Qantas, calculates a government debt guarantee would raise Qantas\u2019s credit rating by at least two notches \u2013 saving the airline $60m a year in direct debt repayments and even more on the forward credit card sales that Qantas is required to collateralise. Virgin says that leaves its rival with $100m to invest in other parts of its business, an unfair advantage that would amount to \u201cpicking winners\u201d and act as a warning to other potential foreign investors in Qantas. Gambaro said a debt facility would give Qantas \u201can unfair advantage\u201d and could leave Australian taxpayers exposed, even if they didn\u2019t provide a hand out to the airline upfront. \u201cThe dynamic translates like this \u2013 if Qantas defaults, the Australian Government, aka the Australian taxpayer, will bail them out,\u201d she said. Regional airline Rex has also vehemently opposed a debt guarantee to Qantas, and warned regional aviation was on the verge of collapse. Rex, which is lobbying the Abbott government to keep an election promise to reinstate a regional airline subsidy scheme, on Wednesday reported a net profit of $3.6mn for the six months to December 31. Another regional airline Brindabella collapsed last year. The government is presenting the debt guarantee as a short-term measure, until amendments can be made to the Qantas Sale Act to remove government-imposed restrictions on Qantas. These include the level of foreign ownership and requirements for repairs and maintenance to be undertaken in Australia, which prime minister Tony Abbott has described as a \u201cball and chain\u201d on the airline\u2019s operations. But with Labor, the Greens and Clive Palmer opposed to reforming the act, those changes are unlikely to pass either the existing senate or the new one that sits from July. In a speech to backbenchers earlier this month, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce pleaded for reform. \u201cWe have never asked for a handout. And we are not asking for one now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Qantas Sale Act limits our financial options, it adds cost to our business and it influences our actions as a publicly listed company. \u201cOver the long term, repealing it is essential to remove the distortions in our aviation system. However, we recognise there is little political and community appetite for changing the act in the short term.\u201d Labor transport spokesman Anthony Albanese said removing the foreign ownership would mean Qantas was no longer an Australian-based airline.",

Details of the damning findings have not been spelled out in full in public documents, but have been uncovered in a Guardian investigation. The leaked papers are also being reported by BBC2's Newsnight, al-Jazeera and the campaign group Global Witness.</p> <p>Allegations that the full scandal has not been laid bare are a huge setback to international efforts \u2013 championed by Barack Obama, the UN, the EU and campaign groups \u2013 to stamp out the illicit trade in conflict gold by requiring the world's largest refineries to be independently audited to check that they are sourcing gold responsibly and publishing the findings.</p> <p>Full details of the findings are set out in confidential inspection reports from Ernst &amp; Young, which was brought in to review the practices of the Kaloti Group, a $12bn refining and trading business based in Dubai. Kaloti owns the largest refinery in the Middle East and is at the centre of Dubai's booming gold industry, estimated to be worth $70bn in 2012. Documents show the group systematically flouted new rules on conflict gold.</p> <p>The UN has been pushing for tough international guidelines covering the trade in gold and other \"conflict minerals\" because of mounting evidence linking extortion at hundreds of mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo to armed groups involved in war crimes.</p> <p>The UN's largest peacekeeping force is deployed in the country, with more than 20,000 uniformed personnel. More than 5 million people are estimated to have died in the DRC or its neighbours in the last two decades, making it the most deadly conflict since the second world war.</p> <p>All refiners around the world must be able to show they meet the new international standards, and have been independently inspected, if they want to continue trading with US multinationals from May this year. Guidelines recommend companies \"make and receive payments for gold through official banking channels where they are reasonably available, avoid cash purchases where possible, and ensure that all unavoidable cash purchases are supported by verifiable documentation\".</p> <p>The rules of the Dubai Multi-Commodities Centre, set up by Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed in 2002 to promote and regulate the gold industry, require refiners to make extra checks on suspicious, cash-in-hand deals above 40,000 dirhams (\u00a36,540). Kaloti had no system in place to do this in 2012.</p> <p>In fact Kaloti paid out $5.2bn in cash-for-gold deals \u2013 equivalent to almost 45% of its business in 2012. E&amp;Y Dubai's inspectors also found the refinery group had:</p> <p>\u2022 Taken millions of dollars of gold knowing it was plated in another metal and seemed to have been smuggled out of Morocco.</p> <p>\u2022 Accepted 2.4 tonnes of gold in more than 1,000 transactions with customers who provided no paperwork.</p> <p>\u2022 Paid cash to Sudanese suppliers who had hand-carried gold to Dubai \u2013 sourced from small-scale, artisan mining operations \u2013 but did not check whether they had approved mining licences.</p> <p>These details from E&amp;Y inspections have never been disclosed before. In Kaloti's much-delayed compliance report, published last December, the failings are mentioned only briefly and in terms that do not leave the reader with a clear picture of the inspectors' findings. Kaloti maintains all failures in its procedures were rectified by November last year, with all but one of its remedial measures having been independently verified by E&amp;Y. In a statement to the Guardian, it said: \"Kaloti had shortcomings in the initial stages of the long multi-staged audit process&#xa0;\u2026 Our fully compliant final result was confirmed by Ernst &amp; Young.\"</p> <p>Both Kaloti and E&amp;Y stressed all shortcomings were properly reported and acknowledged in published reports. Other comparable reports from major refineries in Dubai and elsewhere also offer only very scant descriptions where inspectors have discovered failings, suggesting this may be emerging as common industry practice for these new reports.</p> <p>The Guardian has seen no evidence that published reporting of Kaloti failings was out of line with regulatory rules or industry practice. But leaked emails show their proper presentation in published filings was hotly contested.</p> <p>Both Dubai rules and international standards set by the OECD say that the purpose of publishing reports on the outcome of independent inspections is to demonstrate transparency in relation to refineries' performance on responsible sourcing measures in order to \"generate public confidence\". But before the inspectors' work was finished and their reports filed, the Dubai authorities learned of E&amp;Y's findings and changed their own rule book in a way that meant that the overall verdict of inspectors would stay confidential.</p> <p>The Dubia Multi-Commodities Centre insists these changes were made simply to keep rules in line with similar international standards. \"DMCC strongly refutes any allegation that it sought to influence or interfere with the review process, or that it altered or softened the review process to favour any member refinery,\" it said, adding: \"All findings have been made public and the review and reporting processes are robust.\"</p> <p>Emails show how some at E&amp;Y felt pressure had been put on them by a regulator \"keen to promote the Dubai gold industry\", pressure that led Amjad Rihan, the partner in charge of the inspection division, to break ranks and come forward as a whistleblower. Rihan said he was horrified that the Dubai authorities had altered the rules and that E&amp;Y had signed off as \"fair\" public reports obscuring full details of Kaloti's failings.</p> <p>So brief were eventual descriptions of the failings reports published last December that in press releases the DMCC and Kaloti made no mention of them, celebrating the inspection outcome and stressing Dubai's leading refinery had ended the audit fully compliant, certified as offering conflict-free, responsibly sourced gold.</p> <p>Rihan said: \"I am not a lawyer, but in my opinion, what is 'ethical' and what is 'legal' should not conflict. The DMCC, Ernst &amp; Young and Kaloti were all aware that the risk of conflict gold entering Dubai had been very high. In my opinion, the way they acted is appalling, amoral and extremely unethical.\"</p> <p>At one stage, so serious had E&amp;Y's concerns about how to treat the Kaloti findings become that the case was referred to some of the firm's top global executives and legal experts in London. At one stage, Mark Otty, E&amp;Y's managing partner for Europe, Middle East, India and Africa (EMEIA) based in London, said in an email: \"Rest assured that we are taking this issue very seriously \u2026 I have taken the lead in relation to our investigation of it.\" Otty said later that he was satisfied with the outcome because \"both client and regulator will report deficiencies\".</p> <p>A spokesman for both E&amp;Y divisions declined to answer questions from the Guardian. \"This matter&#xa0;\u2026 concerns work done by EY Dubai, in Dubai, for a Dubai-based client under guidelines promulgated by the DMCC, a Dubai regulatory body.\"</p> <p>Joe Murphy, managing partner at E&amp;Y Dubai, said: \"EY Dubai took the views of our former partner [Rihan] very seriously and prior to issuing our \u2026 report undertook a comprehensive review, including consulting with internal and external experts, who supported the actions we took. We firmly believe that by identifying elements of non-compliance we have played an important role in achieving improvements in the client's supply chain controls.\"</p> <p>E&amp;Y's global code of conduct says: We are robust and courageous in our challenge to clients and are not afraid to deliver unwelcome information to them ... We support people and will withdraw from working for any clients that put our people under undue pressure\". Rihan does not feel that is what happened in Dubai \"I went to senior figures at EY asking them to back me up in my professional opinion but instead I think they went to great lengths to please the client and they pushed me out.\"</p> <p>EY deny this. \"EY Dubai took the views of our former partner very seriously and prior to issuing our \u2026 report undertook a comprehensive review; including consulting with internal and external experts, who supported the actions we took\".</p> <p>New international guidelines have emerged to tackle conflict gold, after similar to curb the trade in blood diamonds.</p> <p>According to a UN report at the end of 2011: \"A significant proportion of gold financing armed groups and criminal networks [within the DRC military] continues to end up in the United Arab Emirates, making the due diligence of refiners, smelters and jewellers based in that country of particular importance.\"central Africa, unless from long-standing industrial suppliers or well-known global traders. Kaloti, the UN report said, insisted it \"had not purchased artisanal gold from the region for three years.\"</p> <p>Dubai is one of the world's global hubs and attracts business from all quarters. Last October the Responsible Jewellery Council, whose members include Cartier, Tiffany &amp; Co, H Samuel, Ernest Jones and Argos, signed a deal recognising Dubai's conflict gold refinery inspection programme and permitting RJC jewellers to market gold bought from the emirate as conflict free.</p> <p>In recent weeks both Apple and Intel have also announced that all gold used in the circuitry of their phones, computers and other devices is now conflict free.</p>",

Kaloti maintains all failures in its procedures were rectified by November last year, with all but one of its remedial measures having been independently verified by E&amp;Y. In a statement to the Guardian, it said: \"Kaloti had shortcomings in the initial stages of the long multi-staged audit process \u2026 Our fully compliant final result was confirmed by Ernst &amp; Young.\" Both Kaloti and E&amp;Y stressed all shortcomings were properly reported and acknowledged in published reports. Other comparable reports from major refineries in Dubai and elsewhere also offer only very scant descriptions where inspectors have discovered failings, suggesting this may be emerging as common industry practice for these new reports. The Guardian has seen no evidence that published reporting of Kaloti failings was out of line with regulatory rules or industry practice. But leaked emails show their proper presentation in published filings was hotly contested. Both Dubai rules and international standards set by the OECD say that the purpose of publishing reports on the outcome of independent inspections is to demonstrate transparency in relation to refineries' performance on responsible sourcing measures in order to \"generate public confidence\". But before the inspectors' work was finished and their reports filed, the Dubai authorities learned of E&amp;Y's findings and changed their own rule book in a way that meant that the overall verdict of inspectors would stay confidential. The Dubia Multi-Commodities Centre insists these changes were made simply to keep rules in line with similar international standards. \"DMCC strongly refutes any allegation that it sought to influence or interfere with the review process, or that it altered or softened the review process to favour any member refinery,\" it said, adding: \"All findings have been made public and the review and reporting processes are robust.\" Emails show how some at E&amp;Y felt pressure had been put on them by a regulator \"keen to promote the Dubai gold industry\", pressure that led Amjad Rihan, the partner in charge of the inspection division, to break ranks and come forward as a whistleblower. Rihan said he was horrified that the Dubai authorities had altered the rules and that E&amp;Y had signed off as \"fair\" public reports obscuring full details of Kaloti's failings. So brief were eventual descriptions of the failings reports published last December that in press releases the DMCC and Kaloti made no mention of them, celebrating the inspection outcome and stressing Dubai's leading refinery had ended the audit fully compliant, certified as offering conflict-free, responsibly sourced gold. Rihan said: \"I am not a lawyer, but in my opinion, what is 'ethical' and what is 'legal' should not conflict. The DMCC, Ernst &amp; Young and Kaloti were all aware that the risk of conflict gold entering Dubai had been very high. In my opinion, the way they acted is appalling, amoral and extremely unethical.\" At one stage, so serious had E&amp;Y's concerns about how to treat the Kaloti findings become that the case was referred to some of the firm's top global executives and legal experts in London. At one stage, Mark Otty, E&amp;Y's managing partner for Europe, Middle East, India and Africa (EMEIA) based in London, said in an email: \"Rest assured that we are taking this issue very seriously \u2026 I have taken the lead in relation to our investigation of it.\" Otty said later that he was satisfied with the outcome because \"both client and regulator will report deficiencies\". A spokesman for both E&amp;Y divisions declined to answer questions from the Guardian. \"This matter \u2026 concerns work done by EY Dubai, in Dubai, for a Dubai-based client under guidelines promulgated by the DMCC, a Dubai regulatory body.\" Joe Murphy, managing partner at E&amp;Y Dubai, said: \"EY Dubai took the views of our former partner [Rihan] very seriously and prior to issuing our \u2026 report undertook a comprehensive review, including consulting with internal and external experts, who supported the actions we took. We firmly believe that by identifying elements of non-compliance we have played an important role in achieving improvements in the client's supply chain controls.\" E&amp;Y's global code of conduct says: We are robust and courageous in our challenge to clients and are not afraid to deliver unwelcome information to them ... We support people and will withdraw from working for any clients that put our people under undue pressure\". Rihan does not feel that is what happened in Dubai \"I went to senior figures at EY asking them to back me up in my professional opinion but instead I think they went to great lengths to please the client and they pushed me out.\" EY deny this. \"EY Dubai took the views of our former partner very seriously and prior to issuing our \u2026 report undertook a comprehensive review; including consulting with internal and external experts, who supported the actions we took\". New international guidelines have emerged to tackle conflict gold, after similar to curb the trade in blood diamonds. According to a UN report at the end of 2011: \"A significant proportion of gold financing armed groups and criminal networks [within the DRC military] continues to end up in the United Arab Emirates, making the due diligence of refiners, smelters and jewellers based in that country of particular importance.\"central Africa, unless from long-standing industrial suppliers or well-known global traders. Kaloti, the UN report said, insisted it \"had not purchased artisanal gold from the region for three years.\" Dubai is one of the world's global hubs and attracts business from all quarters. Last October the Responsible Jewellery Council, whose members include Cartier, Tiffany &amp; Co, H Samuel, Ernest Jones and Argos, signed a deal recognising Dubai's conflict gold refinery inspection programme and permitting RJC jewellers to market gold bought from the emirate as conflict free. In recent weeks both Apple and Intel have also announced that all gold used in the circuitry of their phones, computers and other devices is now conflict free.",
