      "bodyText": "Staff in reindeer antlers, Christmas jumpers and Santa hats are riding the escalators straining for a better view of a children\u2019s choir singing carols. It\u2019s the day of the Christmas party at Asda House in Leeds and there is a buzz as head office staff gather in the lobby for an update on how the stores are performing, in the vital key pre-Christmas shopping days, from the chief executive, Andy Clarke. But he is probably going to put a dampener on the atmosphere because, just before just before he hits the stage, the UK\u2019s longest-serving supermarket boss admits he is not expecting a bumper year. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough December,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cI don\u2019t think when the numbers are released in January you are going to see many [retail bosses] with a big smile of joy.\u201d The squeeze on supermarkets has come from three main directions. For a start, there has been a sea change in shopping habits away from big weekly shops in vast out-of-town superstores in favour of buying less, more often, from local convenience stores. Second, more people are buying online, and third \u2013 but most importantly \u2013 shoppers have been deserting the biggest grocers for discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Asda and its rivals are fighting back with price cuts, but Clarke cannot see any letup in the pressure: \u201cNext year is going to be a year of continued deflation and challenging [sales figures for the industry] \u2026 The customer is going to continue to have value from pricing investments placed by many retailers.\u201d Asda has been suffering most \u2013 its sales have been falling faster than its major rivals for most of this year. Just a few days before the party, the grocer admitted that sales at its established stores dived 4.5% in the three months to the end of September, only a slight improvement on the 4.7% fall in the previous quarter, which was the worst performance in Asda\u2019s 50-year history. A couple of days after the party, new data shows Asda has sunk to its lowest market share in nine years. Clarke insists he is not concerned about market share in the short term. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on delivering overall value for our customers with one clear eye on the medium term and the other on the long term,\u201d he says. He will not throw away profits, he says, to boost top-line sales: \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to buy short-term sales with promotional activity, but I believe that\u2019s not the way to long-term sustainable success.\u201d Last month he pulled out of Black Friday , the US discount day that Asda had in previous years worked so hard to promote in the UK. \u201cIt kept people away from the core shopping mission,\u201d he says, meaning people rushed in for a cheap TV \u2013 which was a loss leader \u2013 but did not buy any food. \u201cAnd judging by what appears to be left in the marketplace in terms of inventory \u2026 it was the right decision to take.\u201d Instead of one day of discounts, Asda chose to spread its price cuts and offers over several weeks in the run-up to Christmas. The change is part of a wider strategy to protect profits. While rivals\u2019 profits have dived, Clarke says Asda\u2019s operating profit margins remain at about 5%, similar to last year. He believes businesses that have lost control of profitability will have more to worry about next year than Asda. Keeping profits steady, he reckons, will give him more firepower and flexibility to ride out the storm, and he will be able to ramp up price cuts as others struggle. Is he preparing a war chest to move in on weaker rivals such as Morrisons, which is also struggling and recently slumped out of the FTSE 100? Clarke says only that it is \u201cinappropriate to speculate\u201d about potential acquisitions. Meanwhile, he argues that Asda\u2019s stable profits will enable it to invest further into lowering prices, improving the quality of food and revamping large stores in an effort to stop shoppers going elsewhere. That includes installing larger fresh food areas and colourful ideas such as McGees, an independent butcher, which is already in many Asda stores in Northern Ireland and has now moved into Scotland and England. After years when the big supermarkets put many small independent retailers out of business, Clarke says he is talking to more independents about taking excess space in Asda stores. He is also doing trials with Decathlon, the sports retailer and gym operator. It is all part of his plan to create \u201csuper destinations\u201d that combine leisure and shopping. Asda has said it will not be joining rivals in axing branches, but it has begun shaving off sections of big stores it no longer needs. Some will become \u201cdark store\u201d warehouse spaces to serve internet customers. That has already happened in Hull and Norwich and more are planned. Investing in developing own-label grocery ranges, which are more profitable, is another priority. The aim is to increase the proportion of own label going through the tills from 45% to 50%. That move reflects the way cheap unbranded goods have driven the growth of discounters Aldi and Lidl. . The way Clarke tells it, Asda is fighting from a position of strength underpinned by a strategic decision to focus on profitability. But rivals and analysts suggest Asda has been forced to focus on profits by Walmart, its struggling US parent company. Asda has recently ditched plans to expand into smaller stores and open more click-and-collect points. A recent note from analysts Bernstein Research suggested Asda had lost its edge on pricing, allowing Tesco and Morrisons to creep closer. Clarke is also \u201crethinking\u201d Asda\u2019s Price Guarantee scheme \u2013 which promises to refund the difference if the supermarket is not 10% cheaper than its rivals \u2013 raising speculation that the retailer is less confident about its position. He insists Asda is on course to halve the gap between its prices and the fast-growing Aldi and Lidl to 5% by 2018, with the grocer likely to invest more than the \u00a31bn in price cuts over five years that he pledged two years ago. But whether Clarke will be around to guide that plan is far from certain. Asda recently poached Sainsbury\u2019s retail and operations director, Roger Burnley, who is due to arrive in Leeds next autumn. Clarke admits the hire was part of a succession plan agreed with Walmart. He says he wants to see out his five-year plan before heading off to new challenges outside Walmart. \u201cRoger knows he\u2019s not ready to take the helm straight away but I\u2019m going to work with him to get him into a position to take over. I want to see this plan through. It would be great for the colleagues and me to finish what we started,\u201d says Clarke. But if Asda\u2019s sales continue to slump, Walmart may have other ideas.",

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct's Mike Ashley to face MPs over working conditions", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley, the billionaire founder of Sports Direct, is to face questions in parliament next year over the working conditions at the company, following revelations made in the Guardian last week. The news that Ashley is to be called in front of the business, innovation and skills select committee came as the retailer attempted to counter the resulting negative publicity by announcing an internal inquiry. The Guardian investigation revealed how temporary warehouse workers at Britain\u2019s largest sportswear chain were subjected to an extraordinary regime of searches and surveillance. Undercover reporters also found evidence that thousands of workers were receiving effective hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. Iain Wright, the Labour MP and chair of the BIS select committee, told the BBC\u2019s News at Six: \u201cWe will invite Mr Ashley in the new year to give evidence.\u201d This marks the second attempt in less than 12 months by MPs to question Ashley, who controls 55% of the shares in the company. In March, he declined an invitation by the Scottish affairs select committee to answer questions over the treatment of employees at the company\u2019s USC retail business and the use of zero-hours contracts. He sent the chairman, Keith Hellawell, instead. However, sources close to the BIS committee said he could be officially summoned this time, as his appearance was being viewed as \u201ca test of parliament\u2019s authority\u201d. Sports Direct said on Thursday that it would launch a review of all agency staff terms and conditions, to be personally overseen by Ashley. The company said: \u201cSports Direct always seeks to improve and do things better, listens to criticism and acts where appropriate. With that in mind the board has agreed that Mike Ashley shall personally oversee a review of all agency worker terms and conditions to ensure the company does not just meet its legal obligations, but also provides a good environment for the entire workforce. We expect him to start that work in the new year.\u201d The lengthy announcement made no mention of the Guardian\u2019s report on pay levels. The company declined to explain why the topic had been excluded from its 1,200-word statement, or expand on a previous comment that it \u201cbelieves it\u2019s in compliance with minimum wage regulations\u201d. Labour\u2019s former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: \u201cThis Sports Direct review is overdue but has the whiff of a pupil marking its own homework. Sports Direct should get an independent third party to do their review into workers\u2019 rights \u2013 the company has a lot to learn.\u201d Chris Rowley, a professor of human resource management at Cass Business School, said: \u201cThe review is a sop as it cannot be objective given it is being overseen by the founder. Someone in the organisation needs to have the courage to say that this will make things worse, and appoint an independent person to produce an evidence-based and objective review.\u201d Sports Direct has been under fire since the publication of the Guardian\u2019s investigation last week, which prompted the Institute of Directors to brand the company a \u201cscar on British business\u201d. At the same time the retailer reported disappointing trading figures, which combined to cause a slump in Sports Direct\u2019s share price, which is now trading down by around 15%. Around \u00a3600m has disappeared from the value of the company, provoking dissent from investors. One Sports Direct shareholder said: \u201cAt least they [Sports Direct] are acknowledging there is an issue. The fact they made a public statement is at least a step but I think there is a degree of cynicism [among shareholders].\u201d Some large shareholders are understood to have met during the week to discuss the crisis at the company under the auspices of the Investor Forum, a body set up to work behind the scenes on disputes between investors and companies. No firm plan is believed to have emerged, though some shareholders are keen to bring in stronger non-executive directors to challenge Ashley\u2019s dominance. Another shareholder said investors would examine Ashley\u2019s pledge before deciding what to do next. At the same time as unveiling its internal review, Sports Direct mounted a robust defence of its employment practices, issuing a long list of rebuttals. It said the warehouse\u2019s public address system was not used to \u201charangue\u201d or \u201cname and shame\u201d staff, but for logistical reasons, for example, to redeploy staff to other areas of the building. It also said it did not penalise staff for being ill. \u201cSanctions may be applied if workers fail to follow the company\u2019s reasonable sickness absence notification procedures, which are in line with industry best practice. The company is not aware of any occasions on which sick children have not been able to be collected from school by their parents. Sports Direct allows staff time off to look after dependents in such circumstances.\u201d Local primary school headteachers had told the Guardian that workers at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire were sending their children to school while sick because they were too afraid to take time off work. The company also defended the security measures at its warehouse in Shirebrook in light of the risk of theft. Sports Direct said banning staff from wearing the 802 brands stocked in the warehouse was not an unusual practice, adding: \u201cThere are of course numerous other brands that staff can easily wear.\u201d Warehouse staff are also forced to go through rigorous searches. They are not paid for their time while being searched, with lawyers indicating to the Guardian that this practice could be a breach of national minimum wage legislation. Previously the firm said: \u201cSports Direct believes it\u2019s in compliance with minimum wage regulations and takes its responsibilities extremely seriously.\u201d The company said all employees, agency workers and visitors, including executive management and board members, were subject to random searches. Sports Direct also defended its use of zero-hours contracts for casual staff in its shops, saying it is not alone in using them. It said a \u201csignificant number\u201d of casual workers had moved into permanent contracts \u201cwhen the circumstances allow\u201d. Many had developed successful careers within the company, including the chief executive, it said. Virtually all casual retail staff were eligible for bonus payments, it said, and more than 80% achieved a performance-related bonus in November. The retailer came under fire from MPs during an urgent parliamentary debate on Monday and a government minister, Nick Boles, said the company would face sanctions if it flouted wage laws. HM Revenue &amp; Customs is facing calls to launch an inquiry into the sportswear retailer.",

Iain Wright, the Labour MP and chair of the BIS select committee, told the BBC\u2019s News at Six: \u201cWe will invite Mr Ashley in the new year to give evidence.\u201d </p> <p>This marks the second attempt in less than 12 months by MPs to question Ashley, who controls 55% of the shares in the company. In March, he declined an invitation by the Scottish affairs select committee to answer questions over the treatment of employees at the company\u2019s USC retail business and the use of zero-hours contracts. He sent the chairman, Keith Hellawell, instead. </p> <p>However, sources close to the BIS committee said he could be officially summoned this time, as his appearance was being viewed as \u201ca test of parliament\u2019s authority\u201d. </p> <p>Sports Direct said on Thursday that it would launch a review of all agency staff terms and conditions, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/18/sports-direct-mike-ashley-to-oversee-review-of-agency-workers-conditions\">to be personally overseen by Ashley</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/18/sports-direct-mike-ashley-to-oversee-review-of-agency-workers-conditions\">Sports Direct: Mike Ashley to oversee review of agency staff's conditions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company said: \u201cSports Direct always seeks to improve and do things better, listens to criticism and acts where appropriate. With that in mind the board has agreed that Mike Ashley shall personally oversee a review of all agency worker terms and conditions to ensure the company does not just meet its legal obligations, but also provides a good environment for the entire workforce. We expect him to start that work in the new year.\u201d </p> <p>The lengthy announcement made no mention of the Guardian\u2019s report on pay levels. The company declined to explain why the topic had been excluded from its 1,200-word statement, or expand on a previous comment that it \u201cbelieves it\u2019s in compliance with minimum wage regulations\u201d. </p> <p>Labour\u2019s former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: \u201cThis Sports Direct review is overdue but has the whiff of a pupil marking its own homework. Sports Direct should get an independent third party to do their review into workers\u2019 rights \u2013 the company has a lot to learn.\u201d </p> <p>Chris Rowley, a professor of human resource management at Cass Business School, said: \u201cThe review is a sop as it cannot be objective given it is being overseen by the founder. Someone in the organisation needs to have the courage to say that this will make things worse, and appoint an independent person to produce an evidence-based and objective review.\u201d </p> <p>Sports Direct has been under fire since the publication of the Guardian\u2019s investigation last week, which prompted the Institute of Directors to brand the company a \u201cscar on British business\u201d. </p> <p>At the same time the retailer reported disappointing trading figures, which combined to cause a slump in Sports Direct\u2019s share price, which is now trading down by around 15%. Around \u00a3600m has disappeared from the value of the company, provoking dissent from investors. </p> <p>One Sports Direct shareholder said: \u201cAt least they [Sports Direct] are acknowledging there is an issue. The fact they made a public statement is at least a step but I think there is a degree of cynicism [among shareholders].\u201d </p> <p>Some large shareholders are understood to have met during the week to discuss the crisis at the company under the auspices of the Investor Forum, a body set up to work behind the scenes on disputes between investors and companies. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/dec/18/sports-direct-shouldnt-mark-its-own-work-external-scrutiny-is-vital\">Sports Direct shouldn't mark its own work \u2013 external scrutiny is vital</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No firm plan is believed to have emerged, though some shareholders are keen to bring in stronger non-executive directors to challenge Ashley\u2019s dominance. Another shareholder said investors would examine Ashley\u2019s pledge before deciding what to do next. </p> <p>At the same time as unveiling its internal review, Sports Direct mounted a robust defence of its employment practices, issuing a long list of rebuttals. It said the warehouse\u2019s public address system was not used to \u201charangue\u201d or \u201cname and shame\u201d staff, but for logistical reasons, for example, to redeploy staff to other areas of the building. It also said it did not penalise staff for being ill. </p> <p>\u201cSanctions may be applied if workers fail to follow the company\u2019s reasonable sickness absence notification procedures, which are in line with industry best practice. The company is not aware of any occasions on which sick children have not been able to be collected from school by their parents. Sports Direct allows staff time off to look after dependents in such circumstances.\u201d </p> <p>Local primary school headteachers had told the Guardian that workers at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire were sending their children to school while sick because they were too afraid to take time off work.</p> <p>The company also defended the security measures at its warehouse in Shirebrook in light of the risk of theft. Sports Direct said banning staff from wearing the 802 brands stocked in the warehouse was not an unusual practice, adding: \u201cThere are of course numerous other brands that staff can easily wear.\u201d </p> <p>Warehouse staff are also forced to go through rigorous searches. They are not paid for their time while being searched, with lawyers indicating to the Guardian that this practice could be a breach of national minimum wage legislation. </p> <p>Previously the firm said: \u201cSports Direct believes it\u2019s in compliance with minimum wage regulations and takes its responsibilities extremely seriously.\u201d The company said all employees, agency workers and visitors, including executive management and board members, were subject to random searches. </p> <p>Sports Direct also defended its use of zero-hours contracts for casual staff in its shops, saying it is not alone in using them. It said a \u201csignificant number\u201d of casual workers had moved into permanent contracts \u201cwhen the circumstances allow\u201d. </p> <p>Many had developed successful careers within the company, including the chief executive, it said.</p> <p>Virtually all casual retail staff were eligible for bonus payments, it said, and more than 80% achieved a performance-related bonus in November. </p> <p>The retailer came under fire from MPs during an urgent parliamentary debate on Monday and a government minister, Nick Boles, said the company would face sanctions if it flouted wage laws. HM Revenue &amp; Customs is facing calls to launch an inquiry into the sportswear retailer.</p>",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Ukraine refuses to repay $3bn loan owed to Russia after bitter row", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ukraine has refused to repay Russia a $3bn (\u00a32.01bn) loan after a bitter row that could put on hold Kiev\u2019s plans to restructure its growing debt with international creditors. The Ukrainian government rejected a Kremlin proposal for repayments in three tranches of $1bn, putting the entire amount on the path to default. Moscow reacted angrily to the move and threatened to sue for the return of its funds, lent to the former president president, Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted in February last year. The loan repayment is due on Sunday but Ukraine has another 10 days from then to sign a deal before an official default is triggered, but after an eleventh hour attempt by Germany to broker a deal failed, the two sides appeared on a collision course. \u201cSince Russia has refused, despite our repeated efforts to sign a restructuring agreement \u2026 to accept our proposals, the cabinet is imposing a moratorium on repayment of the so-called Russian bond,\u201d Arseniy Yatsenyuk, Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, said in a government meeting. He also said Ukraine would cancel payments on $507m of Ukrainian commercial debt held by Russian banks. The moratorium would be in place \u201cuntil the acceptance of our restructuring proposals or the adoption of the relevant court decision ... We are prepared for court action from the Russian side,\u201d he said. Ukraine blamed the Kremlin for scuppering a deal after Moscow\u2019s negotiators refused to join a creditors club organised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has lent Kiev $17.5bn. Ukraine has been at loggerheads with Vladimir Putin for almost two years over accusations he is financing rebel soldiers in the east of the country. This week, Nato\u2019s top civilian official renewed calls for Russia to remove troops from eastern Ukraine, citing Putin\u2019s recent admission that it had military advisers in the region. Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said it was clear Russia had soldiers in the region and they should be withdrawn under the terms of the peace deal it helped broker in February. Ukraine\u2019s parliament, which has descended into fistfighting during several heated debates this year, has repeatedly called on Moscow to relinquish Crimea, which voted to join the Russian federation in an election Kiev says was rigged. The dispute is further complicated by fears that Ukraine is heading for a wider default after the parliament rejected a new tax code and the draft 2016 budget, both considered essential elements of the restructuring demanded by the IMF as the price of its loan. The Ukrainian leadership has also watched warily as developments in Syria and the refugee crisis have forced Europe to consider Putin as an ally, downgrading concerns over Crimea and the simmering tensions in Donetsk and other eastern regions. A proposed gas pipeline from Russia to Germany that would bypass Ukraine and which European commission officials have said appears to break EU rules, has also raised tensions. Ukraine included the two-year bond in its external commercial debt, but Russia has refused to accept the terms it has offered, arguing that the bond was an official bilateral loan. Kiev\u2019s finance ministry said it was still committed to negotiating a restructuring agreement in good faith with Russia. Russia is an official creditor under international agreements, which means that to qualify for more lending from the IMF, Ukraine must show it is open to negotiating in good faith. William Jackson, an emerging markets analyst at Capital Economics, said the implications of the moratorium were unclear. \u201cAccording to a recent decision, the IMF can continue to lend to countries in arrears to official creditors \u2018subject to the debtor\u2019s good faith efforts\u2019 to reach a deal. The Ukrainian authorities have claimed that they have already done so, and are prepared to continue in a similar vein. But it\u2019s not difficult to envisage any debt talks breaking down,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven this, as well as the IMF\u2019s concerns voiced today about parliament\u2019s rejection of the new tax code and 2016 budget, there seems to be a growing risk that the country\u2019s bailout could be put on hold.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Supermarket chain Morrisons has reported brisk sales of potatoes and carrots from a trial of sales of so-called \u201cwonky\u201d seasonal vegetables in stores in Yorkshire and the north-east, and has also relaxed its specifications for brussels sprouts to allow fewer to be wasted. An earlier attempt to sell wonky courgettes was branded \u201cpathetic\u201d by chef and campaigner Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. The imperfect vegetables \u2013 potatoes, carrots, onions and parsnips \u2013 in Morrisons\u2019 latest initiative are all products that are popular at this time of year as staple items on the Christmas dinner plate. They have been selected from farmers\u2019 crops because they are either misshapen, have growth cracks, or are much smaller or larger than average. They have been discounted by about a third in price to reflect that customers might need to spend more time peeling them or might not be able to use the whole vegetable. The company said it had chosen Yorkshire and the north-east for the trial because it has a large number of stores in those regions and can monitor them more easily from its head office in Bradford. Ahead of the peak brussels sprout-buying week of the year, Morrisons has also relaxed its specifications to allow so-called \u201cmonster\u201d sprouts \u2013 up to a third bigger than their usual size because of the unusually warm weather. Morrisons\u2019 average weekly supply of 3,700 tonnes of potatoes soars to 6,500 tonnes during Christmas week, while for sprouts it leaps from 180 tonnes to 650 tonnes. And 20% of sprouts sold during the year are tend to go in a four- to six-day window in the runup to Christmas. The trial in 75 branches started earlier in December and will be rolled out to a further 75 stores, including outlets in the Midlands, and to online delivery in early January. Morrisons claimed initial sales had been \u201cpromising\u201d, with sales close to expectations on potatoes, carrots and onions, although misshapen parsnips were less popular. Sales in the first week have amounted to approximately \u00a325,000. But Drew Kirk, Morrisons\u2019 produce director, admitted that shoppers often sought perfection for their Christmas feast. \u201cCustomers often want their festive meals to look and taste perfect, so it is going to be very interesting to see whether they take to these wonky vegetables over the Christmas period. \u201cSales of our wonky vegetables have been encouraging, as they have been priced at a discount and sold next to the class one crop to give customers the choice. If the sales tell us that customers really like these products, we will roll them out to other parts of the UK.\u201d Morrisons\u2019 competitor Asda now sells wonky vegetables and fruit as standard after research for its own trial showed that 65% of its customers were open to the idea of buying oddly shaped fresh produce, while 75% would definitely \u201cbuy wonky\u201d if it was cheaper. Sainsbury\u2019s has also relaxed its rules on the cosmetic appearance of fresh produce, and Tesco has experimented with putting misshapen fruit and vegetables on offer to encourage people to buy them. Morrisons is stepping up its drive to cut food waste throughout its supply chain. Crucially, it is doing so after pledging in the BBC1 programme Hugh\u2019s War on Waste that it would look at options to sell more imperfect vegetables. In an embarrassing development for Morrisons, the chef who presented the show, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, was filmed giving away oversized and curvy parsnips outside a branch in Wimbledon, to highlight the food waste he says is due to supermarkets\u2019 excessively exacting cosmetic standards. In response, Morrisons undertook a trial of selling wonky courgettes alongside \u201cclass one\u201d courgettes. The \u201cugly\u201d ones, however, sold much more slowly. Fearnley-Whittingstall told the Guardian in an interview in November: \u201cWhen you see the frankly pathetic little trial that Morrisons did with those courgettes, where they put some really substandard, squashy-ended ones in one pile next to some gleaming, perfect ones at the same price, would you believe people went for the really lovely ones? That\u2019s not what we\u2019re asking supermarkets to do.\u201d The timing of Christmas Day on Friday means that supermarkets are preparing for \u201ctrolley gridlock\u201d as shoppers stock up for their festive food shop from this weekend onwards, with next Wednesday set to be the busiest of the year. Global information company Nielsen said shoppers would spend more than \u00a36.4bn at leading supermarkets in the last two weeks in the approach to Christmas, with 60% of consumers delaying their shopping until the last few days. \u201cShoppers will leave it late this year,\u201d said Mike Watkins, Nielsen\u2019s UK head of retailer and business insight. \u201cThis could provide a welcome boost for grocery retailers, particularly with an extra weekday of trading compared with last year. But the discounters could benefit \u2013 a third of people are expecting to do their main Christmas shop at Aldi or Lidl.\u201d",

Both of the Guardian\u2019s undercover reporters were British. However, local people do report that \u201cPoles get the best jobs\u201d at the site. Sports Direct says: Sadly, all companies have to be cognisant of theft from warehouse operations. As such, there is a need for some security measures to be in place at Shirebrook. One simple and sensible way of managing this issue is to ensure that workers do not wear the clothing brands stocked in the warehouse. This is not an unusual practice in many retail companies\u2019 warehouse operations. There are of course numerous other brands that staff can easily wear. All employees, agency workers and visitors, including executive management and board members, are subject to random searches on leaving the Shirebrook warehouse. Trained security staff conduct random searches and the company continues to keep the process under review, with the aim of reducing any inconvenience to staff as much as possible. SG: The Guardian\u2019s undercover reporters worked inside the warehouse in November. The searches were systematic, not random. The searches take, in the Guardian\u2019s experience, one hour and 15 minutes a week. Workers at Shirebrook on the national minimum wage are not paid for their time while they are being searched.",

      "bodyText": "Gin sales in the UK are expected to top \u00a31bn for the first time this year as younger drinkers supplement their taste for vodka with a double shot from a new generation of artisanal distilleries. A survey by the consumer trends agency Mintel found that despite its continuing reputation as a drink for the over-40s suburban couple, younger consumers are now the most likely to drink gin. More than two in five (42%) Brits aged 18 to 34 have drunk gin in the past 12 months, compared with 27% of over-45s. Such is the taste for what was once termed \u201cmother\u2019s ruin\u201d that UK gin sales will top \u00a31.3bn by 2020, Mintel said. The UK\u2019s \u201cgin renaissance\u201d has been under way for several years as tastes and drinking habits have changed. The decline of nightclub culture, where vodka is king, and the shift to eating out and early evening parties has inspired a craft industry of flavoured gins. Chris Wisson, Mintel\u2019s drinks analyst, said the sale of more upmarket mixers like those sold by Fever-Tree have added to the view of the drink as a more refined and cosmopolitan alternative to vodka. The Sipsmith distillery in west London is typical of the latest breed of craft makers that offer a variety of blends and visitor tours, much as Scottish whiskey distilleries have for decades. Wisson said: \u201cOne of gin\u2019s sobriquets is \u2018mother\u2019s ruin\u2019 and the drink still has certain associations with older drinkers, contributing to it being likely to be seen as an older person\u2019s drink and the least likely as a young person\u2019s drink. \u201cHowever, our research indicates that gin is in fact now most likely to be drunk by younger consumers, suggesting that it has a chance to forge a dynamic image and move into even more innovative areas.\u201d Vodka sales remain by far the largest and their dominance has continued after soaring by 8% over the past five years to reach \u00a33.46bn in 2015, accounting for 61% of the total UK white spirit market\u2019s value. Earlier this week, the Office for National Statistics highlighted gin as a feature of the recent small rise in average consumer prices. It said the price per litre of gin has risen for each of the past six years, with the value of gin sold by UK manufacturers almost doubling since 2008. The value put on sales by the ONS was \u00a3254.4m last year, but this was based on the price paid at the factory gate of UK manufacturers and doesn\u2019t include imported gins or the price paid in pubs and clubs. London dry gin, which is made from a fermented grain mash and flavoured with juniper berries, is a staple of the industry and has become a supermarket favourite. Such is the success of supermarket sourcing that a recent Which? guide found that budget gins \u2013 some selling at less than a tenner a bottle \u2013 trounced their more expensive and established rivals in a consumer taste test. Drinks experts from the consumer group rated 12 standard-range gins and gave Morrisons, Lidl and Waitrose higher marks than established brands Greenall\u2019s and Beefeater, while the market leader, Gordon\u2019s \u2013 which accounts for half of all gin sales in the UK \u2013 trailed behind in ninth position.",

The coal clogs the miners\u2019 eyes like eyeliner, so that they look incongruously showbiz. Mining is an industry full of contradictions \u2013 it\u2019s dangerous, arduous work but people love it. The heat and the humidity take an entire career to get used to, but what everyone talks about is their relationship with their colleagues. Most started straight from school. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot has never wanted to leave,\u201d Donna Rees, 49, observes later on at the Knottingley miners\u2019 welfare scheme social club. Nobody\u2019s parents wanted them to go down a mine, yet that\u2019s how so many spent their own lives. \u201cWhen they come out of the mine,\u201d says Keith Poulson, the 55-year-old National Union of Mineworkers representative, \u201cwhat they\u2019ll be wanting to do is shake each other\u2019s hands, because they might never see each other again.\u201d While many of the 450 miners here live in Pontefract, there are men from as far as Durham and Wales. \u201cThey did what Norman Tebbit told them to do,\u201d Poulson says. \u201cThey got on their bike. They followed the industry from closure of pit to closure of pit. And this industry has just thrown them on the scrap heap.\u201d In 2013, the decision was made to close Kellingley colliery; Yvette Cooper, who is MP for a neighbouring constituency, describes a series of attempts to save it, including finding investors, a workforce buy-out and applying for EU state aid. \u201cIt would have been very easy,\u201d Cooper says, \u201cfor the miners to walk away two years ago and the government would have been left with the closure costs.\u201d But they didn\u2019t; instead, they worked to fund the closure and find themselves with a meaner redundancy package than they would have got under Margaret Thatcher. She boosted the statutory amount (12 weeks of average pay) with a \u00a3900 per working year deal that has been rescinded. The pension deal has been eroded, too, with those Kellingley miners having to retire early taking a proportional hit to their annuity income for the rest of their lives. It is bizarre to think of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s as the more generous spirited government, but there it is. Chris Atkinson, 57, emerges and swipes himself out of the mine for the last time. He is in a rush to get to the hospital, \u201conly small things wrong with me, but all work-related, yes.\u201d He had just left school when he started here and only meant to stay six months. \u201cI enjoyed the money when I were a young lad, and I liked the camaraderie later. I just think we\u2019ve been stung.\u201d Mark Phelan, 46, says \u201cit\u2019s like losing part of your family, like grieving. You watch each other\u2019s backs down pit and you wash each other\u2019s backs when you come out.\u201d He intends to open a sandwich bar, and shakes his head, smiling: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be totally, unbelievably different.\u201d Many people try to pin down the bond between people working in the colliery - whether it was working in close proximity, having each other\u2019s backs, being in high risk work. Part of it is the opacity: nobody who isn\u2019t in it could possibly know what it\u2019s like. The alternatives for those who want to remain in heavy industry are few. Two of the three local power stations are also slated to close. There\u2019s a glassworks, which nobody hangs a huge amount of hope on, though 31-year-old electrician Jonathan Davis has an interview there straight after his last shift finishes. Otherwise, there\u2019s a small amount of agriculture, a bit of distribution. At the social club, Chloe Nadin, 16, Brandon Merchant, 17, and Sydney Brooks, 16, are helping out at the Christmas party for retired miners. Nadin wants to be a midwife and work abroad; Merchant wants to go to Magaluf as a tour rep; Brooks wants to work on cruise liners. \u201cWhen I came out of school,\u201d Merchant says, \u201cthere were no jobs. It\u2019s going to be harder for them that\u2019s known nothing but the colliery.\u201d Nadin agrees: \u201cMost of them we were at school with are commuting to Leeds or Wakefield, but [of the miners] they\u2019re too old to be travelling all that way for a job. There\u2019s nothing round here for us. There\u2019s nothing round here for anyone.\u201d Inside, the previous generation of miners watch a stand-up comedian. \u201cThe people that\u2019s done this club up is members,\u201d Rees says of the cavernous, tongue-and-grooved and lino hall that, if it were in London, with no alternation, would be a pop-up lindy-hop club. \u201cI think the community will keep it together, they\u2019ve got to.\u201d There are a couple of voices of determined good cheer. Davis, with the glassworks interview, says: \u201cNew year, new start. I\u2019m ready for a new challenge.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re finishing,\u201d says John Gray, 41. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re breaking up for Christmas. We\u2019ve been coaling as usual. I suppose it will sink in once we don\u2019t come back.\u201d But his colleague and friend, Andrew Webb, 50, says: \u201cIt\u2019s the end of an era, and the beginning of an error.\u201d Webb started mining in Kent, before moving to Stillingfleet, which closed in 2004, and ending up here. \u201cI\u2019m the last Kentish miner,\u201d he says, wryly. \u201cI go back down to Kent and look at the pit villages: when the mine was running, we had welfare clubs, sports teams, the pubs were booming. The villages were self-policing because of the hierarchy of the mine. Now a lot of those villages are overrun with drug culture. People are just looking to be numbed from everyday reality.\u201d Like all the exiting miners, he is carrying a great big bag of stuff, boots, bright orange, black-smeared clothes and a Davy lamp, which he pulls out to show me. It\u2019s impossible to believe it serves a practical purpose, it looks like an exhibit from the V&amp;A. \u201cThis?\u201d he says indignantly. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly sensitive. The smallest flame it can read is 1.4% of methane. If oxygen falls below 17%, it\u2019ll go out. I think the next time that\u2019ll be lit will be at my funeral.\u201d If you believe in keeping fossil fuels in the ground, you should be pleased, in theory; except that the power plant at Drax in nearby Selby will continue to burn coal \u2013 four million tons a year \u2013 which it has imported from America and Colombia. Its owners point out that it wasn\u2019t their idea to close down the UK coal industry, blaming \u201cEuropean environmental legislation (the industrials emissions directive) which requires significant cuts in the emissions of things like sulphur and nitrogen oxide. The foreign-sourced coals have fewer of these impurities.\u201d It\u2019s an insight into the unintended consequences of these regulations, that obeying them while continuing to use coal means shipping it huge distances, which does nothing to cut emissions. The NUM\u2019s Poulson simply will not accept that more couldn\u2019t have been done. \u201cIf we got the subsidies that nuclear power gets, we could afford to mine this field, give it away free and still make a profit. Is that a level playing field?\u201d Not really, from any angle; and now the game\u2019s over.",

    "webTitle": "Tesco builds temporary store in a week to replace flooded Cumbrian superstore", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco has built a temporary 10,000 sq ft store in a week to replace its flooded superstore in Carlisle, which was put out of action by Storm Desmond. Staff took just seven days to construct the makeshift shop, which opened on Thursday. Up to 100 people worked overnight to join together 26 large units and fit out the temporary store. The shop, in the superstore\u2019s car park, opened on Thursday and will serve customers from 6am to midnight, and 10am to 4pm on Sundays. The superstore was inundated by waist-high water over the first weekend of December as Storm Desmond devastated businesses in the region. Tesco staff were evacuated the car park as water rose in the car park as well. The store will be refurbished and is expected to reopen in late January. Up to 100 people worked through the night to assemble the temporary store. Tesco, which has been trying to recoup public favour after a series of scandals, said it had donated food, emergency supplies, sanitary products and other items to shelters, refuge centres and churches in Cumbria. The homes of more than 30 Tesco staff at the Carlisle store were damaged by Storm Desmond, the company said. Matt Davies, Tesco\u2019s UK boss, said: \u201cWe wanted to make sure that people in Carlisle were not left without the service our store provides in the run-up to Christmas and have worked extremely hard to get the temporary store up and running. As well as everyday essentials, the new store will stock a great range of festive favourites to ensure customers don\u2019t miss out this Christmas.\u201d Insurers expect to pay out more than half a billion pounds to households and businesses affected by Storm Desmond. The Association of British Insurers said initial estimates indicated the final amount payable to customers in the north of England and Scotland would be about \u00a3520m. The figure is almost double the \u00a3275m cost of damage caused by floods in Cumbria in 2009 and is higher than some early predictions of about \u00a3300m. Insurers have received 23,700 claims for property damaged either by flood or storm as a result of the extreme weather on 4 and 5 December. More than 19,000 of the claims were by households with the rest made by businesses. There were also 2,800 motor claims linked to the storms, which caused devastation in parts of Cumbria, Lancashire and the Scottish borders. James Dalton, the ABI\u2019s director of general insurance policy, said: \u201cBeing flooded is hugely traumatic and insurers have worked round the clock to get the repair process under way, provide immediate payments to people affected and find families somewhere warm and dry to stay. The flood waters have mostly receded but for affected families and businesses the impact is going to be felt for months. Insurers and their expert teams will be there for the long haul to help communities rebuild and repair.\u201d The ABI said insurers had helped almost 1,500 families into alternative accommodation and made emergency payments worth \u00a32.6m. Loss adjusters have made more than 4,500 visits related to the more severe claims. Businesses damaged by the storm included McVitie\u2019s biscuit factory in Carlisle and James Cropper\u2019s paper factory in Burneside, Cumbria. The upmarket cloth producer Walker Greenbank has warned of potential shortages at its fabric printing site in Lancaster, and Stagecoach\u2019s bus operations in affected areas have been flooded out of service.",

      "body": "<p>Tesco has built a temporary 10,000 sq ft store in a week to replace its flooded superstore in Carlisle, which was put out of action by Storm Desmond.</p> <p>Staff took just seven days to construct the makeshift shop, which opened on Thursday. Up to 100 people worked overnight to join together 26 large units and fit out the temporary store.</p> <p>The shop, in the superstore\u2019s car park, opened on Thursday and will serve customers from 6am to midnight, and 10am to 4pm on Sundays.</p> <p>The superstore was inundated by waist-high water over the first weekend of December as Storm Desmond <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2015/dec/08/storm-desmond-west-coast-main-line-to-reopen-after-floods-live-updates\">devastated businesses in the region</a>. Tesco staff were evacuated the car park as water rose in the car park as well. The store will be refurbished and is expected to reopen in late January.</p> <p>Up to 100 people worked through the night to assemble the temporary store. Tesco, which has been trying to recoup public favour after a series of scandals, said it had donated food, emergency supplies, sanitary products and other items to shelters, refuge centres and churches in Cumbria. The homes of more than 30 Tesco staff at the Carlisle store were damaged by Storm Desmond, the company said.</p> <p>Matt Davies, Tesco\u2019s UK boss, said: \u201cWe wanted to make sure that people in Carlisle were not left without the service our store provides in the run-up to Christmas and have worked extremely hard to get the temporary store up and running. As well as everyday essentials, the new store will stock a great range of festive favourites to ensure customers don\u2019t miss out this Christmas.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c306c173669f077153bd6f950d63feb9dd62e1af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c306c173669f077153bd6f950d63feb9dd62e1af/58_0_765_459/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tesco Carlisle store\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tesco\u2019s temporary Carlisle store.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tesco</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/18/storm-desmond-insurance-bill-520m-association-of-british-insurers\">Insurers expect to pay out more than half a billion pounds</a> to households and businesses affected by Storm Desmond. The Association of British Insurers said initial estimates indicated the final amount payable to customers in the north of England and Scotland would be about \u00a3520m. The figure is almost double the \u00a3275m cost of damage caused by floods in Cumbria in 2009 and is higher than some early predictions of about \u00a3300m.</p> <p>Insurers have received 23,700 claims for property damaged either by flood or storm as a result of the extreme weather on 4 and 5 December. More than 19,000 of the claims were by households with the rest made by businesses. There were also 2,800 motor claims linked to the storms, which caused devastation in parts of Cumbria, Lancashire and the Scottish borders.</p> <p>James Dalton, the ABI\u2019s director of general insurance policy, said: \u201cBeing flooded is hugely traumatic and insurers have worked round the clock to get the repair process under way, provide immediate payments to people affected and find families somewhere warm and dry to stay. The flood waters have mostly receded but for affected families and businesses the impact is going to be felt for months. Insurers and their expert teams will be there for the long haul to help communities rebuild and repair.\u201d</p> <p>The ABI said insurers had helped almost 1,500 families into alternative accommodation and made emergency payments worth \u00a32.6m. Loss adjusters have made more than 4,500 visits related to the more severe claims.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/08/storm-desmond-damage-cumbria-estimated-500m\">Businesses damaged by the storm</a> included McVitie\u2019s biscuit factory in Carlisle and James Cropper\u2019s paper factory in Burneside, Cumbria. The upmarket cloth producer Walker Greenbank has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/14/upmarket-wallpaper-and-fabric-factory-flooded-after-storm-desmond-walker-greenbank\">warned of potential shortages</a> at its fabric printing site in Lancaster, and Stagecoach\u2019s bus operations in affected areas have been flooded out of service.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With this, we are closing up for the day. Thank you for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Have a great weekend! Ukraine\u2019s prime minister Arseny Yatseniuk said his government had imposed a moratorium on a $3bn Eurobond held by Russia after Moscow refused to accept the terms of a restructuring of the debt. He said in a government meeting: Since Russia has refused, despite our repeated efforts to sign a restructuring agreement... to accept our proposals, the cabinet is imposing a moratorium on repayment of the so-called Russian bond.\u201d The Eurobond matures on Sunday, but Ukraine has a 10-day grace period before it will be considered to be in default. Ukraine will also cancel payments on $507m of Ukrainian commercial debt held by Russian banks. The news that Ukraine\u2019s government has announced a moratorium on its $3bn bond held by Russia\u2019s National Welfare Fund is not surprising, says William Jackson, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. It has, unsurprisingly, created significant (additional) political acrimony between Russia and Ukraine. He writes: But, coming alongside concerns about the Ukrainian parliament\u2019s rejection of the new tax code and the draft 2016 budget, it does feed into broader concerns that the country\u2019s IMF programme is now at risk. The Kremlin chose not to participate in Ukraine\u2019s debt restructuring with private creditors earlier in the year. Russia had, apparently, offered to restructure the debt separately, with the principal to be repaid in $1bn annual instalments over the next three years, which Ukraine rejected. Ukraine\u2019s government has claimed that Russia rejected its own restructuring proposal. In terms of what today\u2019s news means for the country\u2019s IMF bailout, the implications are unclear as yet. According to a recent decision, the IMF can continue to lend to countries in arrears to official creditors (the Fund deems this bond to be official) \u201csubject to the debtor\u2019s good faith efforts\u201d to reach a deal. The Ukrainian authorities have claimed that they have already done so, and are prepared to continue in a similar vein. But it\u2019s not difficult to envisage any debt talks breaking down.\u201d Jackson concludes that along with the IMF\u2019s concerns voiced today about parliament\u2019s rejection of the new tax code and 2016 budget, \u201cthere seems to be a growing risk that the country\u2019s bailout could be put on hold\u201d. More on Ukraine: the country has imposed a moratorium on the repayment of its $3bn Russian bonds, which were issued by Ukraine\u2019s previous Moscow-backed government to Russia in late 2013 and were set to mature on Sunday. Here\u2019s the statement from Ukraine: The Cabinet of Minister of Ukraine has approved today the moratorium proposed by the Ukrainian Government to suspend payments of the December 2015 Eurobonds. This moratorium also encompasses Ukraine\u2019s sovereign-guaranteed loans for Ukravtodor and Yuzhnoye.... Ukraine remains committed, without prejudice to its position on the underlying debt obligations themselves, to negotiating in good faith a consensual restructuring of the December 2015 Eurobonds which will allow it to remain in compliance with the financing targets agreed with the IMF under the Extended Fund Facility, while meeting its contractual commitments to other bondholders. Ukraine reserves all its rights under any applicable law or regulation in connection with the December 2015 Eurobonds. The Ukrainian Government expects that the IMF\u2019s new Lending into Official Arrears policy will allow the IMF to continue financing Ukraine under the Extended Fund Facility, notwithstanding the IMF\u2019s position on the December 2015 Eurobonds and today\u2019s decision on suspension of payment thereunder.\u201d Meanwhile, official figures show that Britain\u2019s richest households have pulled further ahead of the rest of the population as house prices have accelerated, with the top 10% now owning almost half of the country\u2019s \u00a311.1trn total private wealth. My colleague Heather Stewart on the economics desk writes: The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said average household wealth was \u00a3225,100 in 2012-14, when it carried out its latest survey of the nation\u2019s assets. Since the previous survey was carried out two years earlier, the top tenth of households had seen a 21% increase in their wealth, including property. Over the same period, the poorest half of households also saw their wealth rise \u2014 but only by 7%. That left the top tenth of households owning 45% of total wealth, while the bottom half were left with just 9%. You can read the full story here. The International Monetary Fund has issued a statement on Ukraine this morning. The Washington-based organisation is not happy that the Ukrainian parliament has rejected the government budget, and warns that it could have implications for the financial support package Ukraine is receiving. David Lipton, the IMF\u2019s first deputy managing director, said: It is with concern that we have observed the discussions yesterday in Parliament that effectively rejected the government\u2019s proposals for a new tax code and the government budget for 2016. Approval of a budget consistent with the program objective of reducing the general government deficit to 3.7 percent of GDP is a key condition for the completion of the second review under the EFF-supported program. At the same time, it is equally important that the budget is supported by structural reforms to remove exemptions and widen the tax base, as well as streamline government spending on a sustainable basis, which also are key objectives of the program. Approval of a budget that deviates from program objectives for 2016 and the medium-term will interrupt the program and inevitably disrupt the associated international financing.\u201d Back to interest rates. David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, argues that the Federal Reserve has raised rates too soon. In a guest blog for the Guardian, he writes: It seems to me there is a 50/50 probability that this hike will have to be reversed and the worry is that this might mean rates going negative. This is what happened with the ECB, which raised rates twice in 2011, and now has negative rates.\u201d The Unite union warns that Sports Direct\u2019s review of its use agency workers will be nothing more than a public relations stunt if it fails to end \u2018Victorian\u2019 work practices at the retailer\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse. Likening working conditions in the warehouse to a \u2018gulag\u2019, the Guardian investigation also found that workers were being \u2018docked\u2019 wages for arriving just one a minute late to work. Unite regional officer Luke Primarolo said: Shameful \u2018Victorian\u2019 work practices have no place in modern Britain and this review should not deter HMRC from investigating the non-payment of the minimum wage to agency workers at Sports Direct. Unite has repeatedly raised concerns with the board and Mike Ashley directly about the use of \u2018Victorian\u2019 work practices. We look forward to participating fully with Mike Ashley\u2019s review and to working with Sports Direct to eradicate the mistreatment of workers at its Shirebrook warehouse. If his review is to be taken seriously then it has to have concrete outcomes, such as restoring dignity at work by moving agency staff at Best Connection and Transline workers onto permanent contracts. A failure to do so will do nothing to restore investor and customer confidence and leave the board open to accusations of doing nothing more than engaging in a public relations stunt.\u201d The pound has perked up a bit today, after hitting an eight-month low against the dollar yesterday when investors bought dollars in the wake of the Fed\u2019s interest rate hike. But sterling is still on track to notch up its worst weekly performance in seven weeks, as investors assume the Bank of England is in no rush to follow in the footsteps of the Fed and raise borrowing costs. Data this week showing inflation at zero and wage growth slowing will keep pressure off the Bank. The pound is up nearly 0.2% today at $1.4925, after falling to $1.4865 yesterday \u2013 the lowest since late April. This week, sterling has lost about 2%. Sports Direct has issued a long list of rebuttals of criticism of its employment practices. More details in my updated story. You can read the company\u2019s statement here. Sports Direct has announced it will launch a review of all agency staff\u2019s terms and conditions, to be overseen personally by its founder Mike Ashley. The move follows a Guardian investigation, which revealed how temporary warehouse workers at Britain\u2019s biggest sportswear chain are subjected to an extraordinary regime of searches and surveillance. Undercover reporters also came up with evidence that thousands of workers were receiving effective hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. In a lengthy statement, the company mounted a robust defence of its employment practices, saying: The board takes its responsibilities towards all the company\u2019s stakeholders, be they staff, contractors, suppliers or customers, extremely seriously. Without our commitment to our staff and the implementation of a performance-led culture which encourages success, there is no way Sports Direct would have been able to grow from a single sports shop over 33 years ago to the global retailer it is today.\u201d But it added: Sports Direct always seeks to improve and do things better, listens to criticism and acts where appropriate. With that in mind ... the board has agreed that Mike Ashley shall personally oversee a review of all agency worker terms and conditions to ensure the company does not just meet its legal obligations, but also provides a good environment for the entire workforce. We expect him to start that work in the New Year.\u201d You can read the full story here. European stock markets have opened lower, as expected. FTSE 100 index in London down 0.5% Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.9% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 1.3% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB down 1% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Bank of Japan surprised financial markets on Friday by taking steps to bolster its quantitative easing programme, which it said were supplementary measures. The unexpected move gave a brief boost to stocks, but the Nikkei closed down 1.9% as enthusiasm turned to disappointment. The dollar was in for a wild ride, initially surging against the yen, before falling back when investors had a closer look at the measures. The Bank of Japan announced a new programme to buy equity-traded funds and lengthened the average maturities on the bonds it buys. But the central bank kept the overall target of annual asset purchases at around 80 trillion yen. In Europe, stock markets are expected to open lower as the post-Fed rally peters out. Asian and European stock markets surged on Thursday as investors responded favourably to the Fed\u2019s first rate hike in nearly a decade.",

    "webTitle": "Almost half of Britain's private wealth owned by top 10% of households", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s richest households have pulled further ahead of the rest of the population as house prices have accelerated, with the top 10% now owning almost half of the country\u2019s \u00a311.1tn total private wealth. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the average household was worth \u00a3225,100 in 2012-14, when it carried out its latest survey of the country\u2019s assets. Since the previous survey two years earlier, the top tenth of households had seen a 21% increase in their wealth, including property and shares. That was three times as fast as the increase over the same period for the poorest half of households, who saw their wealth rise by 7%. It left the top tenth of households owning 45% of total wealth, while the bottom half were left to share just 9%. The poorest 1%, meanwhile, owned just 0.05% of wealth. Inequality of wealth tends to be exacerbated when the prices of assets such as property and shares are rising rapidly, and has become an increasingly controversial political issue. Labour advocated a \u201cmansion tax\u201d on the most valuable homes in its 2015 manifesto. The TUC general secretary drew the contrast between the sharp increase in wealth for the richest households and the squeeze in earned income in recent years as wage growth remained weak after the financial crisis. \u201cThe government must reshape the economy to address the UK\u2019s over-reliance on property and financial investments,\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady said. \u201cFuture growth must be built on the firm foundation of higher wages in both the public and private sectors, and investment in skills and industry.\u201d The shadow Treasury minister, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said: \u201cThis Tory government has done nothing substantive to tackle the growing problem of wealth inequality in our country, in fact by cutting inheritance tax for a wealthy few at the same time as cutting universal credit for working families they are only making matters worse.\u201d Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has recruited the French economist Thomas Piketty \u2013 who advocates taxing wealth more heavily to prevent inequality running out of control \u2013 to his panel of economic advisers. The ONS asked Britain\u2019s families about their savings, shared portfolios and housing wealth. They found that the top 10% owned at least \u00a31,048,500 in assets while the bottom 10% owned \u00a312,600 or less. Duncan Exley, director of the Equality Trust, said: \u201cWhen such a huge chunk of the country\u2019s wealth is found in the hands of so few people, it is clear something has gone terribly wrong. Aside from the disproportionate power this provides the richest, we know this vast inequality also weakens our economy and damages our society.\u201d The ONS found that private pension portfolios accounted for 40% of households\u2019 total wealth, with the richest 10% of households having a \u00a3749,000 pension pot, compared with just \u00a32,800 for households in the least wealthy half of the population. It said the rising value of pension portfolios had been an important cause of the 18% increase in aggregate wealth over the two-year period between its surveys. Asset prices have recovered strongly in recent years, helped by the continuing low level of global interest rates. The Bank of England is yet to increase borrowing costs from the record low of 0.5% they reached in March 2009. Inequality of wealth in Britain has a clear regional dimension, the ONS data showed, with wealth heavily concentrated in London and the south-east, where the housing market has bounced back strongly since the slump that followed the global financial crisis. Average household wealth in the north-east, at \u00a3150,000, was less than half of that in the south-east, where it was \u00a3342,400. In total, property wealth in Britain, net of mortgages, increased by almost \u00a3400bn over the two years between its latest wealth surveys, the ONS found. Mark Posniak, managing director of Dragonfly Property Finance, said: \u201cIn 2014, Finland\u2019s GDP was \u00a3184bn, which means Britain\u2019s property market is effectively an economy in itself. UK homeowners have been able to sit back while their properties, collectively, generate more cash than entire countries.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Good retail sales numbers made a rate hike by the US Federal Reserve almost certain. The rise that finally did take place on Wednesday was well signalled to markets that cheered the rise, with Dow, Nasdaq and the S&amp;P all climbing on the day by more than 1%. Thursday, however, the market was down. The so-called \u201ddot plots\u201d, which show the interest rate forecasts of all 17 attendees at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, suggest that there will be four more rate rises in 2016. This seems unlikely and the market doesn\u2019t believe that either and expects only two. It seems to me there is a 50/50 probability that this hike will have to be reversed and the worry is that this might mean rates going negative. This is what happened with the European Central Bank, which raised rates twice in 2011, and now has negative rates. In the period since the onset of the great recession every central bank that raised rates, including those in Sweden, Denmark, Canada, Switzerland, New Zealand and Israel were forced to reverse course when their economies slowed and it became clear that they had raised too soon. One of the most interesting pieces of information was that the decision was unanimous. Lael Brainard, Charles Evans and Daniel Tarullo had all signalled they were not supportive of a rise, but in the end voted for it. It is clear they didn\u2019t want to weaken Janet Yellen\u2019s position for the battle that will come in 2016. In the end, this was about the chair asserting her dominance over the committee. It is now Yellen\u2019s Fed. My main concern is that it is especially hard to understand the rate rise,given that the Fed has a dual mandate \u2013 to maintain stable prices and to maximise employment. There is no inflation: and inflation expectations seem to be de-anchored and the economy is a long way from full employment. The Fed\u2019s inflation target of 2% uses the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which has been around 0.2% for the past year, due only partly to a steep decline in crude oil prices. Even the rate of core PCE inflation, excluding food and energy prices, has been trending downward since 2011 and currently stands at 1.3%. The Fed has been overly optimistic, regularly forecasting that core inflation would soon turn upward and converge back to its target. But it hasn\u2019t. There is little or no prospect it will do that now: the rate rise will lower core inflation. The continuing appreciation of the US dollar and falling global commodity prices make it highly plausible that the shortfall in core inflation will get worse in coming quarters. It also appears that inflation expectations, both of professional forecasters and households, have become de-anchored below the Fed\u2019s target. According to the results of quarterly surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia in 2013 and 2014, the median forecast for the five-year average PCE inflation rate was very close to the Fed\u2019s target, whereas over the past several quarters that median has declined notably and currently stands at 1.7%. Plus, households\u2019 longer-term inflation expectations have also moved downward significantly over the past year. This is worrying. Unfortunately, inflation expectations may continue to decline over coming quarters, especially if actual inflation remains subdued or drops even further. My Dartmouth colleague Andrew Levin, who was an adviser toJanet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, has suggested, and I agree, at this juncture it is imperative for the Fed to reframe its policy strategy and shore up the credibility of its inflation target. One way of doing that would be to de-emphasise the role of inflation forecasts, which have been persistently wrong over the past few years and instead to link the timing and pace of policy normalisation to actual outcomes for inflation and employment. As Larry Summers has argued rates shouldn\u2019t rise until we see the \u201cwhites of the eyes\u201d of inflation (\u00a3). The US unemployment rate rose to a high of 10% and has now fallen back to 5%. If the US labour market was close to full-employment there should have been a fairly rapid rise in wage growth, which hasn\u2019t happened. The fall in the unemployment rate has been accompanied by a big rise in the proportion that have left the labour force. There has also been a rise in underemployment \u2013 measured by the number of workers who are part time for economic reasons - and this remains well above pre-recession levels. Underemployment and those leaving the workforce: these measures gave not fallen at anything close to the rate that unemployment has. Along with unemployment they continue to keep wage growth down. The concern is that this rate rise may have to be reversed if the US economy slows. The next recession is overdue. The decision by the Fed to raise rates is what I have called \u201cfingers-crossed and hoping\u201d economics. Let\u2019s hope it works out for them.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct is to launch a review of all agency staff terms and conditions, which it said would be overseen personally by its founder Mike Ashley. The move follows a Guardian investigation, which revealed how temporary warehouse workers at Britain\u2019s biggest sportswear chain are subjected to an extraordinary regime of searches and surveillance. Undercover reporters also came up with evidence that thousands of workers were receiving effective hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. The company said on Friday: \u201cSports Direct always seeks to improve and do things better, listens to criticism and acts where appropriate. With that in mind, as noted above, the board has agreed that Mike Ashley shall personally oversee a review of all agency worker terms and conditions to ensure the company does not just meet its legal obligations, but also provides a good environment for the entire workforce. We expect him to start that work in the New Year.\u201d Labour\u2019s former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: \u201cThis Sports Direct review is overdue but has the whiff of a pupil marking its own homework. Sports Direct should get an independent third party to do their review into workers rights - the company has a lot to learn.\u201d At the same time, Sports Direct mounted a robust defence of its employment practices, issuing a long list of rebuttals. It said the warehouse tannoy is not used to \u2018harangue\u2019 or \u2018name and shame\u2019 staff, but is used for logistical reasons, for example, to redeploy staff to other areas of the building. It said it does not penalise staff for being ill. \u201cSanctions may be applied if workers fail to follow the company\u2019s reasonable sickness absence notification procedures, which are in line with industry best practice. The company is not aware of any occasions on which sick children have not been able to be collected from school by their parents. Sports Direct allows staff time off to look after dependants in such circumstances.\u201d Local primary school headteachers had told the Guardian that workers at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire are sending their children to school while sick because they are too afraid to take time off work. The company defended the security measures at its warehouse in Shirebrook in light of the risk of theft. Sports Direct said banning staff from wearing the brands stocked in the warehouse was \u201cnot an unusual practice,\u201d adding: \u201cThere are of course numerous other brands that staff can easily wear.\u201d The Guardian revealed that staff are banned from wearing 802 clothing brands at work, and that they have to go through rigorous searches, and are not paid for their time while being searched. The company said all employees, agency workers and visitors, including executive management and board members, are subject to \u201crandom searches\u201d. Sports Direct also defended its use of zero hour contracts for casual staff in its shops, saying it is not alone in using them. It added that a \u201csignificant number\u201d of casual workers had moved from zero hour terms into permanent contracts \u201cwhen the circumstances allow\u201d. Many have developed successful careers within the company, including the chief executive, it said. It also said that virtually all casual retail staff are eligible for bonus payments and that more than 80% achieved a performance-related bonus in November. The retailer came under fire from MPs during an urgent parliamentary debate on Monday and a government minister, Nick Boles, said the company would face sanctions if it flouted wage laws. HM Revenue &amp; Customs is facing increasing pressure to launch an inquiry into the sportswear retailer.",

With that in mind, as noted above, the board has agreed that Mike Ashley shall personally oversee a review of all agency worker terms and conditions to ensure the company does not just meet its legal obligations, but also provides a good environment for the entire workforce.

Sports Direct should get an independent third party to do their review into workers rights - the company has a lot to learn.\u201d<br></p> <p>At the same time, Sports Direct mounted a robust defence of its employment practices, issuing a long list of rebuttals.<br></p> <p>It said the warehouse tannoy is not used to \u2018harangue\u2019 or \u2018name and shame\u2019 staff, but is used for logistical reasons, for example, to redeploy staff to other areas of the building.</p> <p>It said it does not penalise staff for being ill. \u201cSanctions may be applied if workers fail to follow the company\u2019s reasonable sickness absence notification procedures, which are in line with industry best practice. The company is not aware of any occasions on which sick children have not been able to be collected from school by their parents. Sports Direct allows staff time off to look after dependants in such circumstances.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-staff-shirebrook-strikes-policy-sick-leave\">Local primary school headteachers had told the Guardian</a> that workers at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire are sending their children to school while sick because they are too afraid to take time off work.</p> <p>The company defended the security measures at its warehouse in Shirebrook in light of the risk of theft. Sports Direct said banning staff from wearing the brands stocked in the warehouse was \u201cnot an unusual practice,\u201d adding: \u201cThere are of course numerous other brands that staff can easily wear.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">The Guardian revealed</a> that staff are banned from wearing 802 clothing brands at work, and that they have to go through rigorous searches, and are not paid for their time while being searched.</p> <p>The company said all employees, agency workers and visitors, including executive management and board members, are subject to \u201crandom searches\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYSdH0y42OI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYSdH0y42OI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYSdH0y42OI&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Daily body searches: workers are banned from wearing 802 brands.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Sports Direct also defended its use of zero hour contracts for casual staff in its shops, saying it is not alone in using them. It added that a \u201csignificant number\u201d of casual workers had moved from zero hour terms into permanent contracts \u201cwhen the circumstances allow\u201d. Many have developed successful careers within the company, including the chief executive, it said.</p> <p>It also said that virtually all casual retail staff are eligible for bonus payments and that more than 80% achieved a performance-related bonus in November.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/14/sports-direct-crisis-grows-as-mps-and-investors-question-business\">The retailer came under fire from MPs</a> during an urgent parliamentary debate on Monday and a government minister, Nick Boles, said the company would face sanctions if it flouted wage laws.

Watchdog Ofgem said more than 500,000 customers had been affected, with many suffering \u201csignificant distress and worry\u201d, and has ordered the group to pay the fine as a consumer redress package. The settlement is the largest agreed between Ofgem and a big six energy supplier. The money will be divided between some of the worst-affected customers and charity. Ofgem\u2019s action was welcomed by consumer groups. Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which? said: \u201cOfgem is right to dish out a hefty fine as npower has clearly failed its customers. Time and again we\u2019ve found the biggest suppliers aren\u2019t getting the basics right on customer service.\u201d Tom Lyon, from price comparison website uSwitch.com, said the scale of the record settlement \u201cserves as a shot across the bows of the industry that consumers must be treated fairly.\u201d Ofgem said many of npower\u2019s problems surfaced after the company, which is owned by the German group RWE, introduced a new IT system in 2011. Between September 2013 and December 2014, it issued over 500,000 late energy bills. Some customers also received inaccurate bills with little or no detail as to how these had been calculated. During this period npower customers made over 2m complaints, with the majority about late or inaccurate bills. Ofgem said the company often failed to resolve these issues promptly, pursued debts that were in dispute and failed to keep its commitments to customers on billing. It also failed to deal with complaints effectively because of failures with its IT system. Unresolved complaints were logged as resolved and multiple records created for one issue, creating follow-up problems for customers. The supplier did not refer all customers to its complaint handling procedures and, in some cases, it failed to advise them that they could take their complaint to the Energy Ombudsman if unresolved after eight weeks. Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: \u201cNpower failed its customers. Not only have its billing and complaint handling procedures been chaotic, it treated many of its customers poorly, which is completely unacceptable.\u201d He added: \u201cThe payment of \u00a326m sends a strong message to the industry that we expect them to act quickly and effectively to ensure a good customer experience.\u201d Npower apologised to customers and said it had agreed targets for improvement with the industry regulator. Simon Stacey, npower\u2019s head of domestic markets, said: \u201cWe are very sorry about what has happened and that is why we have agreed this significant package of customer redress.\u201d He said the group had cut customer complaints by nearly 70% since the beginning of this year and, as part of the package of measures with Ofgem, had agreed targets for customer service improvement. Npower said customers who were affected did not need to take any action as they would be contacted by the company.",

      "bodyText": "A young woman who had her travel insurance claim denied due to her mental illness has won a landmark discrimination case in the Victorian civil and administrative tribunal. In 2012, Ella Ingram cancelled a year-12 school trip to the United States after suffering a severe episode of depression. It was the first time she had shown symptoms of the illness. Her family applied to QBE to claim back the costs of the cancelled trip, but the insurance giant denied the claim, saying its policies did not extend to cover mental illness. Ingram, now a 21-year old nursing student, took the case to court, claiming the insurance policy was discriminatory. On Friday the tribunal agreed, awarding Ingram nearly $4,300 for economic losses arising from the claim, and a further $15,000 for hurt and humiliation. The tribunal found that QBE had engaged in \u201cunlawful discrimination when it included the mental illness exclusion\u201d in its travel insurance policy, noting that mental illness can be classed as a disability and is therefore covered by anti-discrimination laws. The tribunal found that the policy exclusion was a breach of section 44 of the Equal Opportunity Act, which says that people cannot discriminate against others by refusing them goods and services. \u201cI really want this to pave the way for others living with a mental illness to stand up for their rights, and insurers to not treat us like second-class citizens,\u201d Ingram said in a statement issued through Victorian Legal Aid, which provided her with representation. \u201cI thought their treatment of me might be what I would experience for the rest of my life.\u201d The tribunal rejected claims by the insurer that it would suffer \u201cunjustifiable hardship\u201d if it removed blanket exclusions on mental health claims. \u201cThere was no evidence that it considered any statistics, actuarial data or expert medical information about the risks presented by different types of mental illnesses when it created this travel insurance policy and decided to exclude all claims made because of a mental illness,\u201d said Melanie Schleiger from Victorian Legal Aid. \u201cElla\u2019s win confirms that compliance with discrimination laws is not optional and that insurers need to base their decisions on evidence, not stereotypes and assumptions, when they reject a claim or cover because of a mental illness.\u201d Mental illness awareness group beyondblue welcomed the finding and urged the insurance industry to remove discriminatory clauses from life insurance and income protection policies as well as travel. \u201cWe call on the insurance industry to embrace 21st century expectations and change policies and practices that discriminate against people with past or present mental health conditions,\u201d its chief executive, Georgie Harman, said. \u201cWe are seeking a champion of the insurance industry to step forward and work with us to design a fair and equitable policy that treats people as individuals.\u201d Harman said discriminatory insurance clauses further \u201creinforce stigma and discourage people from seeking support when they need it most\u201d. She argued that insurance companies did not differentiate between mental health symptoms, such as insomnia and stress, and diagnosable illnesses such as depression and anxiety. \u201cThis results in blanket exclusions which paint everyone as high-risk and uninsurable,\u201d she said. The chief executive of Mental Health Australia, Frank Quinlan, said the case should provoke wholesale change in the industry. \u201cInsurance companies seem to think that there are two kinds of people in the world, and if you have a history of mental illness then the insurance market, which many of us take for granted, is not for you. We hope the outcome of this case will be a catalyst for change in the insurance sector.\u201d Quinlan and Harman have called for the removal of all mental health policy exclusions and greater training for staff who work in the sector.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a finding that sounds correct even before you\u2019ve read the survey: high pay for chief executives demotivates the rest of the workforce, and staff work less hard if they think the boss is creaming off an unfair share of the spoils. The supporting research comes from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). Almost six in 10 employees said the high level of chief executive pay in the UK demotivated them. Only 8% said such rewards at the top inspired staff to work hard. What else would you expect? As Stefan Stern, head of the High Pay Centre, puts it: \u201cOutlandish pay sustains the myth that a single, heroic individual is somehow running a big business on his or her own. That\u2019s simply untrue.\u201d Yes, and the employees know it is untrue. The CIPD, calling for a rethink in chief executives\u2019 complex pay packages, says a crisis point has been reached. Indeed, even some of the recipients of these packages struggle to see the logic. The new boss of Deutsche Bank said the other week that he didn\u2019t know why he had been offered a contract with a bonus because he wouldn\u2019t work harder or any less hard as a result. In a rational world, the suppliers of capital \u2013 the shareholders \u2013 would also be screaming for reform since pay-for-performance, the supposed justification for the surge in executive pay, has failed even within its own narrow terms. Median pay for chief executives in FTSE 100 companies was \u00a31.4m in 2003, \u00a32.4m by 2009 and \u00a33.3m in 2014. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 index has failed to keep pace: it first reached its current level in 1999. One or two fund managers \u2013 representatives of shareholders and pension fund savers \u2013 do concentrate on the size of executive pay packages, as opposed to attempting to fiddle fruitlessly with their design. But shareholder power isn\u2019t having much effect. The coalition government gave shareholders binding votes on boardroom pay but the CIPD is right to say \u201cthere is little evidence that the status quo has been disturbed in any meaningful way.\u201d What should be done? Transparency would be improved if companies \u2013 and public-sector organisations \u2013 were obliged to publish the ratio between the chief executive\u2019s pay and the average employee\u2019s pay; even the US is going down that path. But one suspects bald statistics alone won\u2019t do much. Adjusting the line-up of people making pay decisions might. How about putting employee representatives on remuneration committees? Apologists for the current system tend to be outraged by what they regard as dangerous interference in traditional governance arrangements. Boards are meant to be unitary, it is argued, and members of the pay committee should be aware of a company\u2019s overall strategy. The objections have some force but, after three decades in which executive pay has lost touch with general pay inflation and returns to shareholders, it is reasonable to try something new. Employees on pay committees would \u201cinject a much-needed dose of reality into boardrooms\u201d, says the TUC union\u2019s general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady. They might. It\u2019s an idea whose time has come. Too much, too soon for Purplebricks? We are familiar with ebitda \u2013 or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation \u2013 alternatively known as profits before the nasty stuff. Here\u2019s a new one from Purplebricks: contribution before media costs. On this basis, the low-fee estate agency did splendidly in the five months to September. Only 18 months after launch, it produced a \u00a3314,000 \u201ccontribution\u201d. And those media costs? Unfortunately, they were \u00a35.16m, meaning ebitda was a negative \u00a34.85m on revenues of \u00a35.73m. Those numbers tell us only that that Purplebricks is a young company obliged to spend heavily on advertising \u2013 mostly on television \u2013 to catch the eyes of people wanting to sell their homes. Its longer-term value may lie in its business model, described as a hybrid between traditional estate agents and an online version. As argued here previously, Purplebricks looks best placed of the new crew hoping to disrupt the market for the benefit of customers. That assessment holds but was made before Purplebricks disclosed in its float prospectus quite how small its revenues are, and how much it currently contributes to TV companies\u2019 coffers. Good luck to the Purplists, but, from a hard-headed investment perspective, the \u00a3240m valuation looks too much, too soon. AstraZeneca takes a punt on Acerta On a grander scale, AstraZeneca is paying $4bn for a 55% stake in Acerta Pharma, a US-Dutch company whose main development drug, a potential treatment for blood cancer, has yet to reach the market. If AstraZeneca wants full control, it will end up paying $7bn. It\u2019s one hell of a punt on an unproven medicine but, by the standards of these things, it may be close to fair value. US company Abbvie paid $21bn this year for Pharmacyclics, whose novel haemotology drug had previously been approved. If Acerta\u2019s rival is merely highly likely to be approved, and if AstraZeneca genuinely thinks it will be \u201cbest in class\u201d, then $4bn plus $3bn looks reasonable. Attractive odds, however, won\u2019t spare chief executive Pascal Soriot\u2019s blushes if his nag crashes at the final regulatory hurdle. That\u2019s life in the big pharma business.",

      "bodyText": "A crisis point has been reached in executive pay with workers demotivated by chief executives\u2019 soaraway pay deals, according to a leading body that represents the human resources sector. Six in 10 employees told a survey that the high level of chief executive pay discouraged them in the workplace, and more than half of those surveyed felt that high level of pay was bad for a firm\u2019s reputation. The survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which represents human resources professionals, found that 70% of employees felt chief executive pay was too high, but that proportion fell to 44% when asked about their own chief executive \u2013 due, in part, to ignorance about their own organisation. The CIPD built on research by the High Pay Centre showing that chief executives were paid 183 times more than the average employee, compared with 47 times in 1998. \u201cThe growing disparity between pay at the high and lower ends of the pay scale for today\u2019s workforce is leading to a real sense of unfairness, which is impacting on employees\u2019 motivation at work,\u201d said Charles Cotton, CIPD\u2019s reward adviser. \u201cThe message from employees to CEOs is clear: \u2018the more you take, the less we\u2019ll give\u2019. At a time when the average employee has seen their salary increase by just a few percentage points over the last several years, we need to take a serious look at the issue of top executive reward.\u201d The gap between pay at the top and those in the workforce has been highlighted in the past, including by the London mayor, Boris Johnson, who told the Conservative party conference in October that social ties would fray if the economic gap between citizens grew too big. He also appeared to target Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the advertising group WPP, saying: \u201cThere are some gigantic self-appointed sequoias that pay themselves 780 times the salary of the little shrublets they employ.\u201d The CIPD said companies should publish their pay gap \u2013 US firms are required to do so from 2017 \u2013 and also allow employees to sit on their remuneration committees. The view was echoed by the TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady, who said having employees on company boards would \u201cinject a much-needed dose of reality into boardrooms and put the brakes\u201d on big pay deals. \u201cSoaraway executive pay is bad for business,\u201d said O\u2019Grady. \u201cCompanies should be looking to reduce the pay gap between top execs and the rest of their workforces as a matter of urgency. This will boost staff productivity and ensure that workers get a fairer share of the rewards.\u201d The report examined how company bosses managed to keep their pay deals so high and pointed to an element of \u201crigging\u201d by those executives who are able to highlight areas in which they perform. The report added: \u201cResearch shows that individuals high in narcissism are not only more likely to emerge as leaders, but among CEOs with longer tenure, more narcissistic CEOs receive bigger compensation packages, have higher shareholders, with a larger discrepancy between their total compensation and other members of their executive team.\u201d The CIPD report concluded that \u201cCEO reward practice had reached crisis point\u201d. There is little evidence about how chief executives are selected and more is needed, the report said. \u201cThis should curb the myth of the heroic CEO and lead to greater accountability across the board, which should in turn equate to smaller pay gaps,\u201d it added.",
