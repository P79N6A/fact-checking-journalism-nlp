    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Senior banker questions Mark Carney's forward guidance policy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of Britain's most senior bankers has questioned the effectiveness of Mark Carney's policy of \"forward guidance\", which ties future interest-rate rises to the level of unemployment in the UK. Lord Burns, currently chairman of Santander in the UK and former chief economic adviser and permanent secretary to the Treasury, said that if he had still been at the Treasury he would have \"pushed back\" against the Bank of England governor's pledge to keep interest rates at their historic 0.5% low. Carney, who took control of the Bank of England in June, has indicated that interest rates will not rise unless the unemployment rate falls from 7.7% to 7%, provided that inflation does not get out of control in the meantime. Burns, speaking at a conference organised by the British Bankers' Association, said he was \"not terribly enthusiastic\" about forward guidance and that, while he was not upset about the focus on unemployment, \"I don't think it will make very much difference\". Even so, he indicated that he did not wish to complain about the policy, which he said may well have been devised before the recent improvement in economic data. \"It is understandable that you want to reframe [policy] and it was possible it was policy in the making before we had the better run of figures,\" Burns said. At the same conference, the Bank of England mounted a robust defence of its decision to relax rules allowing Chinese banks to operate in the UK, insisting that the policy was not created to coincide with George Osborne's trip to China. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Bank's regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), said that the decision to allow Chinese banks to operate as branches rather than subsidiaries should not be seen as a \"free for all\". He added: \"It is a general policy, not a China policy, and it is consistent with promoting the benefits of an open world economy.\" Bailey was speaking after concerns were raised by the Treasury select committee that the regulator had been put under government pressure to help Chinese banks set up in the City. Setting up as a branch allows Chinese banks to be regulated in China, while setting up a subsidiary would require banks to comply with the \u2013 probably tougher \u2013 rules of the PRA. In response to questioning by Sir Win Bischoff, chairman of Lloyds Banking Group, Bailey said: \"I don't think of us setting out to create competitive advantage \u2026 I don't regard myself as a promoter of the City of London\". Bailey said he did not expect the branches to be focused on taking retail deposits \u2013 which might have led to concerns about losses for savers, as was the case when the Icelandic banks ran into trouble five years ago. Instead, he said, the branches were likely to be \"straightforward wholesale banks of the type that support world trade and capital flows\". The conference comes at a time when the Financial Ombudsman Service is still receiving about 2,000 complaints a day about the industry, and Martin Wheatley, the head of the Financial Conduct Authority, revealed that one of the big four banks had yet to end the link between retail sales targets and bonuses. Wheatley, , whose organisation has been investigating bonuses, said: \"The early analysis \u2013 and I think we have to stress this is early analysis \u2013 shows three of the biggest UK banks have removed the direct link to sales in incentive arrangements for frontline staff in retail branches and call centres.\" The banks are hoping that their new seven-day switching service for current accounts will head off any attempt by the government to force them to make accounts portable, like mobile phone numbers. The Payments Council dismissed figures released by Virgin suggesting the service was currently showing a 30% failure rate. The council, which is overseeing the switching service, said that 95% of customer accounts were being switched within the promised seven day period, but admitted that 25% needed additional security checks.",

      "body": "<p>One of Britain's most senior bankers has questioned the effectiveness of Mark Carney's policy of \"forward guidance\", which ties future interest-rate rises to the level of unemployment in the UK.</p> <p>Lord Burns, currently chairman of Santander in the UK and former chief economic adviser and permanent secretary to the Treasury, said that if he had still been at the Treasury he would have \"pushed back\" against the Bank of England governor's pledge to keep interest rates at their historic 0.5% low.</p> <p>Carney, who took control of the Bank of England in June, has indicated that interest rates will not rise unless the unemployment rate falls from 7.7% to 7%, provided that inflation does not get out of control in the meantime.</p> <p>Burns, speaking at a conference organised by the British Bankers' Association, said he was \"not terribly enthusiastic\" about forward guidance and that, while he was not upset about the focus on unemployment, \"I don't think it will make very much difference\".</p> <p>Even so, he indicated that he did not wish to complain about the policy, which he said may well have been devised before the recent improvement in economic data. \"It is understandable that you want to reframe [policy] and it was possible it was policy in the making before we had the better run of figures,\" Burns said.</p> <p>At the same conference, the Bank of England mounted a robust defence of its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/16/osborne-chinese-banks-mps-check-city\" title=\"\">decision to relax rules allowing Chinese banks to operate in the UK</a>, insisting that the policy was not created to coincide with George Osborne's trip to China. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Bank's regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), said that the decision to allow Chinese banks to operate as branches rather than subsidiaries should not be seen as a \"free for all\". He added: \"It is a general policy, not a China policy, and it is consistent with promoting the benefits of an open world economy.\"</p> <p>Bailey was speaking after concerns were raised by the Treasury select committee that the regulator had been put under government pressure to help Chinese banks set up in the City. Setting up as a branch allows Chinese banks to be regulated in China, while setting up a subsidiary would require banks to comply with the \u2013 probably tougher \u2013 rules of the PRA.</p> <p>In response to questioning by Sir Win Bischoff, chairman of Lloyds Banking Group, Bailey said: \"I don't think of us setting out to create competitive advantage \u2026 I don't regard myself as a promoter of the City of London\".</p> <p>Bailey said he did not expect the branches to be focused on taking retail deposits \u2013 which might have led to concerns about losses for savers, as was the case when the Icelandic banks ran into trouble five years ago. Instead, he said, the branches were likely to be \"straightforward wholesale banks of the type that support world trade and capital flows\".</p> <p>The conference comes at a time when the Financial Ombudsman Service is still receiving about 2,000 complaints a day about the industry, and Martin Wheatley, the head of the Financial Conduct Authority, revealed that one of the big four banks had yet to end the link between retail sales targets and bonuses. Wheatley, , whose organisation has been investigating bonuses, said: \"The early analysis \u2013 and I think we have to stress this is early analysis \u2013 shows three of the biggest UK banks have removed the direct link to sales in incentive arrangements for frontline staff in retail branches and call centres.\"</p> <p>The banks are hoping that their new seven-day switching service for current accounts will head off any attempt by the government to force them to make accounts portable, like mobile phone numbers. The Payments Council dismissed figures released by Virgin suggesting the service was currently showing a 30% failure rate. The council, which is overseeing the switching service, said that 95% of customer accounts were being switched within the promised seven day period, but admitted that 25% needed additional security checks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With my US colleagues covering all the latest developments in Washington and across America here, I'm going to shut up shop from London. Our summary of overnight reaction to the spending and debt ceiling deal is here Otherwise.... European stock markets have closed unspectacularly, with traders blaming profit taking, and jitters over a repeat of the debt ceiling crisis when the deal expires in early 2014. In the UK, British Gas has ignited a storm by raising prices by 9.2% (check out the twitter backlash). While a decent jump in retail sales has boosted confidence in the UK economy, and George Osborne has confirmed that Chinese firms will be welcome to invest in the UK nuclear power industry. There have also been fresh protests in Greece today. I'll be back tomorrow... Cheers all, and goodbye. GW And that's it, European stock markets have closed -- giving a resounding shrug to the news that America avoided a catastrophic default at the last minute. Why no rally? A mixture of profit-taking, and unease that the deal agreed yesterday is too short-term. Also, shares never really tumbled during the long US deadlock. The FTSE 100 just closed a measly 4 points higher, at 6576, up 0.07%. Spain's IBEX gained 0.3%, the French CAC dropped 0.1%, while Italy's FTSE MIB and Gernany's DAX both dropped 0.4%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones remains in the red, down 57 points. In the currency markets, the dollar continues to slide as economist predict that the Federal Reserve might not taper its stimulus programme until next March. The pound has now gained two cents against the dollar, to $1.6160. Matt Basi of CMC Markets commented: The US dollar has lost ground across the board today, as focus shifts to the economic consequences of the government shutdown. The dollar sell-off hints at the markets view of Fed tapering, which must surely now be pushed back well into 2014 given that we are very much in the dark as to the real effect on US growth of the shutdown until the government data departments are back up and running. Also weighing on the greenback was news that a Chinese ratings agency, Dagong Global Credit Rating, cut its rating for US debt to A- from A, following on from Fitch putting the US on \u2018negative watch\u2019 on Tuesday. Britain's strong retail sales figures for September (see here) also helped the pound. With America's fiscal crisis fixed, for a few months at least, attention may return to the eurozone again. Over in Greece, university staff and students have been holding a protest rally against the job cuts being imposed through the government's austerity programme: In a separate demo, protesters carried baskets of food and household goods as an ironic gift for finance minister Yannis Stournaras, after he said last week that members of his family were sharing in the struggle to make ends meet. And in the political sphere, there's much interest in Germany's finance ministry denying that it's working on a new aid package for Greece, to fix next year's funding shortfall. The Kathimerini newspaper has the story: A high-ranking German official has denied reports that the country's Finance Ministry is working on a new aid package for Greece. Martin Kotthaus, a spokesman for Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, on Thursday rejected the report, published in Die Zeit newspaper, as \u201cspeculation.\u201d According to the report, Berlin is drafting a package with a number of measures aimed at easing Greek debt. The issue, Kotthaus said, will be discussed during mid-2014, adding that troika officials will continue their evaluation process before a final report is published in November or December. Kotthaus admitted that there are problems in plans to roll over Greek bonds held by European banks and other lenders, saying that several options are on the table. Over in Washington DC, Barack Obama's holding a press conference - my US colleague Tom McCarthy is live-blogging it here. He's telling the press that \"the spectacle we've seen\" in the last few weeks has hurt America, depressing its friends and encouraging its enemies. We are the indispensable nation that other people look to for support, and a place to invest, Obama added. America will bounce back. The full faith and credit of the United States remains unquestioned, he added. But Washington cannot risk a repeat of the federal shutdown, and the flirtation with a default. Obama is also urging Washington to end its pandering to special interests and bloggers and lobbyists, and focus on passing a balanced US budget. As Tom puts it, Obama sounds \" stern, taking his slightly pained, mildly sclerotic tone\". There's a live video feed here UK chancellor George Osborne's trip to China is drawing to a close, with a big announcement that Chinese firms will be allowed to invest in the UK energy sector. We've just uploaded a video clip: America's crisis officially over: My US colleague, Tom McCarthy, is back at his computer after last night's drama and has launched a new live blog covering all the action stateside as Federal workers return to their desks: US government shutdown ends as federal employees return to work \u2013 live Washington DC's Hirshhorn museum is open again, having been shuttered by the partial government shutdown. It's urging visitors to help it recover the activity lost over the last fortnight: A former chief restructuring officer from the US Treasury has warned that America cannot take risks with its credit worthiness. Jim Millstein told Bloomberg TV the federal shutdown, and the debt limit row, had been: Completely counter-productive from the point of view of getting to the main event, which is getting our fiscal house in order. Millstein said he was hopeful that real progress could be made to address America's deficit and debt mountain (around $17 trillion) over the next five to seven years. However, that means looking at tax as well as spending, which is impossible if the Republicans are only prepared to look at government spending but not revenues, he added. Goldman Sachs shares are also dragging the Dow down, dropping 2.6% after third-quarter results missed forecasts. Goldman and IBM (-6.5%), along with United Health (-3.3%), are basically responsible for the entire triple-digit drop on the Dow in early trading. Most other stocks are flat, or up a bit. Time for a summary of events so far today. The US has averted the risk of a catastrophic debt default after Congress finally agreed a spending bill to reopen the Federal government and extend the debt limit. The short-term deal, signed after midnight Washington time (read it here) gives the government the authority to borrow until early February, and also approves budget spending until January 15th. Here's the key points. Hundreds of thousands of government workers have been asked to return to their desks, as analysts ponder the political fallout. The IMF also weighed in, urging America to avoid a repeat of the debt ceiling debacle that has loomed over the global economy. The short-term nature of the deal has disappointed the financial markets, who expect a repeat of recent deadlock and conflict in the months ahead. Most European stock markets have fallen so far today. Wall Street just opened in the red, with the Dow dropping over 100 points in early trading. Early this morning, China's Dagong agency downgraded the US credit rating, from A to A-. It warned that: The government is still approaching the verge of default crisis. The dollar has lost ground in the currency markets, amid speculation that the Federal Reserve will continue its stimulus programme at the current rate until March 2014. On a brighter note, the cost of insuring US debt has dropped, and the prices of short-term Treasury bonds have risen. Financial experts are relieved that the risk of a US technical default is off the agenda, at least until early 2014. But many expect further brinkmanship and conflict on Capitol Hill in the coming months. Here's some early comment ...and here's a bit more. In Washington, Democrat and Republicans will begin discussing long-term budget issues, as part of the 'budget conference' agreed in the deal. Wall Street is open, and shares are dropping in early trading. The Dow Jones index fell by 116 points in the first few minutes, a drop of 0.7%,x to 15257. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices are also in the red, following today's losses in Europe. The Dow is being dragged down by IBM, whose shares have fallen 6% after it missed revenue forecasts last night, blaming a slowdown in China. China's Dagong credit rating agency has now uploaded its statement, confirming that it had downgraded the US by one notch to A- . Dagong Downgrades the U.S. Sovereign Credit Ratings to A- Dagong Global Credit Rating Co., Ltd. As covered earlier, Dagong is alarmed by the Federal shutdown (now finally over), and worried that America is sliding deeper towards the verge of a \"default crisis\". For example: The partial U.S. federal government shutdown apparently highlights the deterioration of the government\u2019s solvency, pushing the sovereign debts into a crisis status. The U.S. federal government announced its shutdown on Oct. 1, 2013, a radical event that reflects the liquidity shortage aroused by depleting stock of debts without the increase of new debts, directly resulting in the federal government lack of the funds for its normal function. The partial U.S. government shutdown is an inevitable outcome of its long-term failure to pay its excessive debts. Dagong is also concerned that the US national debt will keep rising, and criticised the 'monetisation' of US liabilities through the Federal Reserve's QE schemes. The agency also pointed to the disfunction on Capital Hill: As the issue of paying sovereign debts falls into a tool that the parties make use of to realize their own interests, the political environment is unfavorable for eliminating the risk of its sovereign debt default in the long term. US short-term government debt is being treated as an ultra-safe haven again, with prices rising back to their previous levels after dipping in recent days. Makes sense, as there's no danger of America defaulting in October and November. These price rises have driven down the interest rates on one-month Treasury bills to the lowest rate since the end of September. A bill that matures on 14 November is now yielding just 0.01%, compared to 0.15% yesterday. The US dollar continues to slide. It's now lost one and a half cents against the pound, which is trading at $1.611. The euro has also gained more than one cent, to $1.365 Toby Nangle of Threadneedle Investments warns that the US dollar's status as the world's premier reserve currency has taken a knock over the last few weeks: That a technical default has been averted is to be welcomed, but the public brinkmanship involved in arriving at this temporary extension of the debt ceiling has been unpalatable and serves to further chip away at the U.S. dollar\u2019s status as unquestioned reserve currency. Threadneedle now expect the Federal Reserve to resist tapering its bond-buying asset purchase scheme until March 2014. More here on the WSJ Jane Foley of Rabobank agrees that the Fed probably won't taper until March 2014. This promise of much more quantitative easing is pushing the dollar down, she adds, writing: Poor old dollar.... The prospect of another uncomfortable debate in government raises the prospect that the Fed could potentially defer tapering until its March policy meeting. As a consequence we will this week lower our USD forecasts across the board; our new forecasts will be published tomorrow. The weekly US jobs data has just been released, and shows that more people filed new benefit claims than expected last week. A total of 358,000 new jobless claims were filed in the seven days to October 12, down from 374,000 the previous week, but rather higher than the 335,000 that Wall Street expected. Here's some more snaps: 17-Oct-201313:30 - US JOBLESS CLAIMS 4-WK AVG ROSE TO 336,500 OCT 12 WEEK FROM 324,750 PRIOR WEEK (PREVIOUS 325,000) 17-Oct-2013 13:30 - US CONTINUED CLAIMS FELL TO 2.859 MLN (CONS. 2.915 MLN) OCT 5 WEEK FROM 2.902 MLN PRIOR WEEK (PREV 2.905 MLN) 17-Oct-2013 13:30 - US INSURED UNEMPLOYMENT RATE UNCHANGED AT 2.2 PCT OCT 5 WEEK FROM PRIOR WEEK (PREV 2.2 PCT) 17-Oct-2013 13:30 - US LABOR DEPT OFFICIAL SAYS NO NOTICEABLE INCREASE IN NEW CLAIMS FROM NON-FEDERAL WORKERS AFFECTED BY THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN The full spending bill is online here as a pdf. Goldman Sachs bonus pool for the last quarter was around 35% shallower than last year, after the bank saw net profits applicable to shareholders, and revenues, drop. From today's results statement: The accrual for compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, estimated year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits) was $2.38 billion for the third quarter of 2013, 35% lower than the third quarter of 2012. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for the first nine months of 2013 was 41.0%, compared with 43.0% for the first six months of 2013 and 44.0% for the first nine months of 2012. Total staff increased 3% compared with the end of the second quarter of 2013. The topline net earnings figure from Goldman is $1.52bn, or $2.88 a share, up slightly from $1.51bn a year ago. Goldman Sachs is pinning its hopes on Congress resolving the long-term uncertainty over America's budgets, as it releases its third-quarter results which showed a 2% drop in net profits compared with last year. Goldman reported a sharp drop in net revenues in the last three months, to $6.722bn compared to $8.612bn in the three months to June 30. Weak bond trading activity is one factor. Lloyd C. Blankfein, chairman and CEO, said: The third quarter\u2019s results reflected a period of slow client activity. Still, we saw various signs that our clients are prepared to act on significant transactions and we believe that the firm is well positioned to help our clients accomplish their objectives. As longer term U.S. budget issues are resolved, we could see an improvement in corporate and investor sentiment that would help lay the basis for a more sustained recovery. Goldman also reported net profits (applicable to shareholders) of $1.429bn in the three months to 30 September, down from $1.861bn in the previous quarter, and $1.458bn a year go. UK business secretary Vince Cable has moved another step closer to launching a new business bank, by naming former Standard Chartered exec Ron Emerson as chairman (via Jill Treanor) Over on Business Insider, Henry Blodget is laying into the 144 Republicans (here's a list) who voted against the spending bill last night. Blodget's not too impressed with the deal (like most people we've quoted today): It's not a long-term deal, of course. In fact, it's not even a medium-term deal. It's a two or three month deal. Which means that the Congress-people elected to lead our country will once again soon be in their favorite position in the world: In front of TV cameras grandstanding about how \"the opposition\" is destroying the country and demanding that everyone kowtow to their every demand. But he's particularly irked that a senior player like Paul Ryan (the Republican Party nominee for Vice President in the 2012 election) could oppose a deal that fended off the default risk, saying: [Ryan] has a reputation for being fiscally responsible, on account of some budget ideas he has put forward in recent years. Ryan's vote to send the U.S. into default should delete this reputation for fiscal responsibility once and for all. Here Are The 144 Republicans Who Voted To Send The U.S. Into Default A new straw poll from Citigroup suggests America won't suffer a credit rating downgrade from a 'big three' agency (rather than China's Dagong) in the next six months: Reuters has peered into the details of the spending bill signed by president Obama shortly after midnight in Washington, and found that it contains many commitments beyond simply extending the debt limit. Amid the 35 pages are $450m for Colorado flood relief and more than $600m for fire management and fire suppression, plus money to spend up paying benefits to veterans . There's also an extra $1.2bn for a dam in Kentucky, plus fresh authority for the Department of Defense to continue to support African forces pursuing Joseph Kony and the Lord's Resistance Army. There's also no pay rise for Congress, it says: Also notable is what the 35 pages do not include. Congress likely was wise to spell out that its members will not see any pay increase as a result of the deal. The bill states that members will not receive any cost of living adjustments during the fiscal year 2014 that began on October 1. The East Coast of America is waking up to a new day with a functioning government and no imminent risk of stumbling into a debt default. Bloomberg TV has been talking about the political ramifications of last night's deal. Ian Bremmer, Eurasia group president, argued that a 'grand bargain' (of sorts) has been carved out: Bremmer said: There was a grand bargain - the Republicans have imploded, but [Barack] Obama has frittered away the first year of his second term as president. Obviously not the long-term agreement on fiscal policy which is needed. One important element of last night's deal is that the House and the Senate will set up a 'budget conference', which will deliver a report by mid-December. Peter Cook, Bloomberg's chief Washington correspondent, says that this panel will meet this morning to start discussing long-term fiscal plans. They're going to meet over breakfast... to try and get things off on the right foot. No surprise that the cost of insuring US government debt against default has fallen this morning. A one-year credit default swap (which would pay out if America defaulted) has dropped by 7 basis points to 51 bps, data provider Markit reported. It had hit a two year high of 75 basis points yesterday (meaning it costs $75,000 to insure $10m of Treasury bills). More importantly, perhaps, this is still more than the cost of a five-year CDS contract (which is trading at 32 basis points). A one-year CDS contract should be cheaper, given the risk of long-term uncertainty. But in America's case right now, the uncertainty is still in the short term. Three hours into the European trading day, and the main stock markets are all in the red as the US debt ceiling deal leaves investors underwhelmed. The French and German stock markets have fallen by 0.7%, while over in Moscow Russia's main index has slid by 1.5%. Britain's FTSE 100 is slightly lower. David Madden, IG analyst, reckons that \"traders are worried that the US will be downgraded\" by Fitch, which two nights ago put America's AAA credit rating on negative watch. Madden adds: Stock markets are not longer celebrating the deal that was struck yesterday between the Democrats and Republicans to avoid an armageddon style default \u2013 the focus has now switched to the US credit rating as traders wonder whether or not it will remain unchanged. The agreement reached has indeed brought about an end to the shutdown and pushed back the debt ceiling talks until February, but investors simply view this as the government hitting the snooze button yet again. Ratings agency Fitch is edging even closer to lowering the US credit rating, and if other agencies follow suit we could see a repeat of August 2011*. * - when S&amp;P became the first agency to downgrade the US, after the previous debt ceiling deal was raised. The US debt ceiling deal continues to get an underwhelming response in the financial world, with the FTSE 100 still in the red (down 20 points at 6551). As flagged up at 8.37am, City experts are worried that Congress only extended the US debt ceiling by four months, and only fund the Federal government until January. Many fear a rerun of last month's battles, once US politicians sit down to consider longer-term budget . Luke Bartholomew, investment analyst at Aberdeen Asset Management, calls it a \"a hollow victory for Capitol Hill\": The debt ceiling standoff has ended with the starting gun being fired on negotiations on automatic budget cuts in the form of the sequestration. That could be a good thing if it means some of the more arbitrary cuts are replaced by reasoned ones. But that will require Republicans and Democrats to cooperate which can never be assumed. The US can take a sigh of relief for now but the New Year could bring a dangerous sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. \u201cThese budget talks have cast a cloud over the US\u2019s international reputation and heaped pressure on the Fed. A decision to taper QE was expected in December but the government shutdown means the Fed is deprived of the very economic data it\u2019s said it will base its decisions on.\u201d Here's our latest news story on the US debt ceiling deal, and Christine Lagarde's warning that America must stop flirting with disaster over its borrowing limits: US shutdown: IMF chief calls for stability after debt crisis averted Meanwhile, in the UK, British Gas has thrown more fuel on the debate over household energy prices by hiking tariffs by an average of 9.2%. Parent company Centrica announced that gas prices will rise by 8.4%, while electricity bills will see a double-digit increase of 10.4%. British Gas's increase is even higher than the 8.2% increase announced by SSE last week. It comes less than a month after Labour leader Ed Miliband vowed to freeze prizes if he won the next election. In a statement, British Gas said it was a 'difficult decision', and acknowledged that \"hard-pressed households\" are suffering as real wages keep falling. Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy, blamed wholesales energy prices and charges imposed by the government. \u201cI know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes aren\u2019t keeping pace. We haven\u2019t taken this decision lightly, but what\u2019s pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all directly under our control, such as the global price of energy, charges that we have to pay for using the national grid that delivers energy to the home, and the cost of the Government\u2019s social and environmental programmes. Back on those reports that Dagong has downgraded the US credit rating -- journalist Alexander Smith has got hold of the full statement, and uploaded it here. Here's a flavour: For a long time the U.S. government maintains its solvency by repaying its old debts through raising new debts, which constantly aggravates the vulnerability of the federal government\u2019s solvency. Hence the government is still approaching the verge of default crisis, a situation that cannot be substantially alleviated in the foreseeable future. Dagong should be calling me back at some point to discuss the situation.... Good economic news in the UK -- retail sales rose by 0.6% on a monthly basis in September, twice as fast as expected. The Office for National Statistics reported that spending on household goods jumped by 3.0% compared with August, while textiles and clothing spending was up 1.2%. It's another encouraging development, following yesterday's drop in the number of people claiming unemployment benefit. It's also a little curious, given wages continue to lag well behind inflation. Last night's deal to avert a US debt ceiling disaster should also cheer the high street, as the crucial festive period approached. Richard Lowe, head of retail &amp; wholesale at Barclays, says Britain could enjoy a good Christmas: September\u2019s figures bring to a close a summer of good results and good levels of growth in the sector. Looking ahead, the high street is already filling up with glittering displays to tempt shoppers in the lead up to what we expect to be a strong Christmas. I'm still trying to find the full statement from Dagong. (its website keeps flashing up error messages). In the meantime, Reuters' IFR Markets bureau flags up that the agency also left the US rating on a 'negative outlook', suggesting it could cut the A- rating further. Here's IFR take, from the Reuters terminal: Chinese rating agency Dagong has downgraded the United States to A- from A and maintained a negative outlook on the sovereign's credit. The agency suggested that, while a default has been averted by a last minute agreement in Congress, the fundamental situation of debt growth outpacing fiscal income and GDP remains unchanged. \"Hence the US government is still approaching the verge of default crisis, a situation that cannot be substantially alleviated in the foreseeable future,\" Dagong said in a press release. Dagong's ratings are hardly followed outside of China. The agency also classifies most countries it follows very differently from major agencies such as Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch. For instance, like the major agencies, Dagong rates Norway Triple A. However, the US was rated A and the United Kingdom has an A+ rating with Dagong, while Moody's for one, has the UK at and the US at Aaa, the highest level on the New York-based agency's scale. Yet, the Chinese agency is not alone in pointing out that the creditworthiness of the United States is not as good as it once was. Yesterday, Fitch put the Triple A rating it gives to the US under negative watch.In August 2011, Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the US to AA+ after a protracted debt ceiling debate in Congress brought the government to the verge of a shutdown. Apart from the symbolic meaning of the downgrade, though, Dagong's move is expected to have no effect on markets. Although, as fastFT points out, the gold price has risen this morning: Gold prices were higher after the reports circulated, with spot prices up $29 on the day at $1,310 a troy ounce. Even before today's reported downgrade, Dagong only classed America as a \"High credit rating\" nation, with a single-A rating. That's several notches below AAA. Why? Because Dagong has long been concerned that America's national debt is too high, and questioned whether the US is really committed to repaying its creditors (as this Bloomberg story from 2010 shows) . China's Dagong credit rating agency just downgraded America's credit rating, following the short-term deal hammered out last night, according to reports. Dagong has cut the US rating by one notch to A-, from A. Dagong has warned that the debacle over the US debt ceiling shows America's \"incapacity\" to solve its national debt crisis. The agency also cited the damage caused by the shutdown on the US economy, saying America would probably have to actually borrow even more money to cover the lost economic activity. Dagong isn't one of the Big Three ratings agencies, so this shouldn't send ripples through the financial markets. And a cut from A to A- is less dramatic than losing America's AAA credit rating (as Fitch is now threatening to do, and S&amp;P did in 2011). But it shows the concern in Beijing over the situation. After initial relief, the US dollar is also falling this morning. It's lost half a percent against both the pound (which has risen to $1.603), and the euro ($1.361). Reuters says the fall is due to traders pondering the damage caused to the US economy ($24bn of lost output, according to S&amp;P) This could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to slow its quantitative easing stimulus programme (which is pumping $85bn into the US economy each month). \"We would expect this impasse to shave off part of fourth-quarter growth and hurt consumer confidence especially from the government sector,\" said Simon Derrick, head of currency strategy at BNY Mellon. \"What this does is push back expectations of Fed tapering to early 2014 and this is dollar negative.\" The broad reaction in the City is that the US deal is a short-term sticking plaster, not a long-term fix. Analysts expect more conflict on Capitol Hill. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets predicts another battle in January. The compromise solution has the government reopened until January 15th, the debt ceiling raised until February 7th and a pledge to negotiate further deficits cuts by December 13th. While this staves off the immediate uncertainty it also means that we have to go through this entire circus again in the New Year. Talk about kicking the proverbial can down the road, the only difference is we get to use the phrase with respect to the US instead of Europe. Isn\u2019t irony sweet? Oh joy, Happy New Year everybody! Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets, believes the world economy will shake off the impact of the shutdown. The shutdown of the U.S. government will probably not have helped Q4 GDP. Nevertheless the worldwide economic upturn remains on track going into 2014. Anita Paluch of Gekko Markets reckons the Federal Reserve won't rush to slow (or 'taper') its stimulus programme: Good news \u2013 the tapering will be delayed, the bad news \u2013 the 11th hour deal is not a solution but just a problem postponed. And Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, says European stock markets are also suffering from weak corporate earnings. Overnight, we heard worrying news from IBM who blamed stalling sales in China as the reason for sliding group revenues. eBay meanwhile warned of tougher trading conditions in the US while Black &amp; Decker blamed the US government shutdown as a reason to warn on profits. In Europe this morning, we\u2019ve another ugly set of earnings from the likes of Metso, Remy Cointreau [luxury sector posting poor numbers \u2013 LVMH missed expectations this week] while KPN shares are under pressure after American Movil pulls out its takeover bid for the Dutch telecom company. Shares are falling in early trading in Europe, as the US debt ceiling deal fails to cheer the markets on this side of the Atlantic. The FTSE 100 has dropped 17 points, to 6553. The German DAX and French CAC are also down by 0.3%. The City is disappointed that Congress didn't agree a longer-term deal. Traders are already anticipating another bruising battle on Capitol Hill in early 2014. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says there's lots of work still to do. The budget needs to be re-negotiated within 2 months, the government will be re-opened and funded for just 3 months and the debt ceiling issue pushed back for 4 months. The muted market reaction (US &amp; European futures down) suggests them already pricing in a standoff re-run in Dec, Jan and Feb. Neither party can be proud, although Democrats look to have the upper hand, showing prepared hold firm and blame ultimately being directed at Republicans (or at least factions) refusing to give up on their rejection of Obamacare. Traders have also been digesting S&amp;P's estimate that the shutdown cost the US economy $1.5bn each day -- that's a lot of missed business for firms across America, and the globe. Overnight, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim summed up the relief in the corridors of power, saying the global economy has \"dodged a potential catastrophe\". The International Monetary Fund has welcomed the news that Congress has raised America's $16.7 trillion debt ceiling before its borrowing authorisation ran out, at midnight tonight. But IMF chief Christine Lagarde warned that America must break the cycle of uncertainty over its debt limits. She also called for the 'sequester' (deep spending cuts) to be replaced by a less harsh method of fiscal consolidation. Lagarde said: The U.S. Congress has taken an important and necessary step by ending the partial shutdown of the federal government and lifting the debt ceiling, which enables the government to continue its operations without disruption for the next few months while budget negotiations continue to unfold. Looking forward, it will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner. We also continue to encourage the U.S. to approve a budget for 2014 and replace the sequester with gradually phased-in measures that would not harm the recovery, and to adopt a balanced and comprehensive medium-term fiscal plan. Earlier today our Australian economics blogger, Greg Jericho, held a Q&amp;A on the debt ceiling deal and its implications for the global economy. Here's a flavour, on why the debt ceiling should be canned: The main thing that needs to be done is just abolish the debt ceiling. The market doesn't give a stuff about it being raised - the bond yields never go up because it is raised, they only go up when Congress threatens to block move for it to be raised. But I can't see it happening, purely because there are those who view it as a weapon in their arsenal that they can use to force spending cuts etc. But what today has really shown is that if the other side refuses to budget, the threat to allow a default ends up being an empty one. Greg Jericho answers your questions on the US debt default crisis - as it happened From Washington, my colleagues Paul Lewis and Dan Roberts report on how the deal leaves the Republican party licking its wounds: The US Congress passed legislation to rescue the country from the brink of a looming debt default on Wednesday night, bringing an end to the two-week crisis that has closed large portions of the government and revealed deep divisions in the Republican party. The bill, a temporary fix that will last only through to the start of 2014, passed easily with broad bipartisan support in the Senate, where Democratic and Republican leaders forged the agreement just hours earlier. But it was able to pass the Republican-dominated House shortly after 10pm only with the support of Democrats. It laid bare a rupture between moderate and more rightwing Republicans, who triggered the crisis by using their budgetary leverage in what turned out to be a futile effort to undermine Barack Obama's signature healthcare reforms. Only 87 House Republicans voted for the bill. The party leadership was opposed by 144 members, including Paul Ryan, the former vice-presidential candidate and a key figure in Congress. In brief remarks at the White House shortly before the House vote, Obama said he hoped the deal would \"lift the cloud of uncertainty\" that had hung over the country in recent weeks. My US colleagues live-blogged all the action from Washington (and quite gripping it was too). Here's their closing summary: \u2022 The House and Senate both passed a bill this evening funding the government and raising the debt ceiling until early 2014.President Obama says he will sign it \"immediately,\" as in, tonight. \u2022 The 16-day government shutdown is over. Government employees will receive retroactive pay for the shutdown period. \u2022 Fiscal talks will now shift to a budget conference between the House and Senate, where a negotiated report is due by mid-December. The talks will be led by the budget committee chairs of each chamber, senator Patty Murray and congressman Paul Ryan. \u2022 President Obama will speak tomorrow about his budget priorities. He claims that he's willing to discuss \"anything.\" \u2022 Speaker Boehner, despite passing a bill with mostly Democratic support, is not expected to lose his job. He even got a standing ovation from the House Republican conference today. Congress passes bill to raise US debt ceiling and end shutdown \u2013 live Good morning. America is returning to normality this morning after the deadlock in Congress over the US debt ceiling was broken. Just after midnight East Coast time, president Barack Obama signed legislation to reopen the Federal government, fund its operations until January 15 2013 and extend the country's borrowing authority for another four months, to February 17. So, a short-term fix, but one which averts the danger of America defaulting on its debts and triggering a financial panic. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers, many of whom have been idle for the past 16 days, are now expected to return to work --- as businesses count the cost of a two-week hiatus. The deal leaves the Republican party in some turmoil. The majority of its members in the House of Representatives voted against the bill, underlining the split between radical Tea Party members and moderate Republicans. Shares on Wall Street roared ahead as the deal neared, and Asian stock markets have mostly risen overnight. Japan's Nikkei jumped 119 point to 14,586, + 0.8% We're not expecting a big rally in Europe this morning, though. Most analysts reckoned Congress would do the right thing eventually. But the fact some members of Congress were prepared to risk a default may have caused lasting damage to America's pivotal role in the global financial system. I'll be tracking the reaction to the deal over the next few hours, along with other events across the world economy, the eurozone, the financial markets and the business world.",

      "bodyText": "HMV is relaunching its online strategy seven months after it was bought out of administration. The entertainment retailer, which is now owned by restructuring specialist Hilco, has kickstarted its new digital strategy with a free mobile phone app, which was launched on Thursday. The app allows shoppers to buy or listen to tasters of tracks by scanning CD covers, posters or adverts in store or elsewhere or by playing songs from the radio into their phone. It will be the first non-iTunes based digital music download app available via Apple phones. Users can buy or pre-order tracks from HMV's digital catalogue and store them online to play on Android or Apple phones. The retailer's digital music store will be fully integrated into a revamped website, which is due to launch next week, extending the ability to listen to and buy digital music to other platforms, including Windows PC and the BlackBerry 10 and Windows smartphones. Paul McGowan, the chief executive of Hilco Capital and chairman of HMV, said: \"HMV's position at the heart of entertainment retail demands that we enable customers to buy their music from HMV in the way that best suits them and to engage more closely with the music, video and gaming worlds.\" Hilco's \u00a350m buyout of HMV secured 2,500 jobs at 141 shops, just over half the chain. The buyout was strongly supported by music labels keen to back an alternative to the online behemoth Amazon. HMV fell into administration in January amid tough competition from supermarkets and online stores. It also struggled to cope as shoppers switched rapidly to digital downloads of music, films and computer games and increasingly used online services such as Spotify and Netflix, rather than browsing for CDs and DVDs on the high street. HMV's new app and online store is part of a fightback strategy as nearly 30% of music sold in the UK was downloaded last year compared with about 20% in 2010, according to figures from retail analysts Conlumino. By 2015, about 45% of music is expected to be downloaded. Alongside the new app and website, McGowan said HMV would also be revitalising its YouTube channel and stepping up the number of live events in its stores. Hilco is hoping to repeat the success it has had so far with HMV Canada, which it bought several years ago.",

More than 50 potential lenders \u2013 including peer-to-peer lenders \u2013 have signed up. Sixty staff are already working at the business bank and the headcount is expected to rise to 100 by the time the EU grants state aid permissions next year, when the bank is expected to operate as a standalone institution owned by the government. The bank works by offering guarantees on loans, and inherited \u00a31.3bn of existing schemes. The first \u00a3300m of the \u00a31bn promised by George Osborne in last year's autumn statement is expected to be lent out soon. Emerson said that putting the existing schemes into the business bank had bolstered lending by 58%.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Hans Riegel obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hans Riegel, who has died aged 90 of heart failure, devoted his life to the company that bears one of the great names of confectionery \u2013 Haribo. Building up his family business into an international brand producing 100m sweets a day made him one of Germany's richest men. Johannes Peter Riegel, always known by the abbreviation Hans, was the elder son of Hans Riegel, who set up the business in 1920, registering it under an acronym derived from HAns RIegel BOnn. Hans senior set the tone for the future with a \"dancing bear\" sweet in 1922, and deliveries were made by his wife Gertrud, initially on a bicycle. In 1945 Hans senior died, and upon returning to Bonn from Allied prisoner-of-war camps, Hans junior and his younger brother, Paul, resolved to revive and expand the family business, whose production plant remained largely undamaged. They changed the recipe of their gummy bear sweets to make them coloured and fruit-flavoured. Paul took charge of production and technical matters, while Hans, who had been studying economics at the University of Bonn, handled sales and marketing. The gummy bear proved an unstoppable success. When the brothers started, they had a workforce of about 30. Within five years it had grown to more than 1,000, and today Haribo employs some 6,000 people at 15 factories in several countries, including a base in Pontefract, West Yorkshire. Its takeover of Dunhills, maker of the liquorice buttons known as Pontefract cakes, was completed in 1994, one of a number of purchases that expanded the firm's range of products to more than 200. They are now sold in more than 100 countries and Haribo has an annual turnover exceeding \u00a31.6bn. Starmix is the ubiquitous Haribo product in the UK, but the most popular globally is the Gummi bear. In 2007, Hans ordered the expression on Gummi bears' faces \u2013 in Britain they are called Goldbears \u2013 to be changed from a scowl to a smile. The company's phenomenal growth is largely due to the efforts of Hans, a reader of children's magazines and keen adopter of television advertising and slogans, backed by Paul's contribution to quality and consistency. The business, despite the everyday modesty of its product, is an example of the kind of enterprise that made the postwar \"economic miracle\" in West Germany possible, through the Mittelstand, or small to medium-size enterprises. As the Riegels expanded the company, each owning 50% of the business, they proceeded with caution, chary of borrowing money or speculating. Today Haribo remains privately owned, its headquarters still in Bonn. When my family and I lived in the area in the 1970s, my elder daughter took part in a tradition started by Hans senior in 1936. She and her German schoolfriends would harvest horse chestnuts in autumn, gather them into sacks and drag them to the Haribo factory gate; they were intended as a seasonal treat for the deer on the nearby Riegel family estate. In exchange for the conkers, the children were given generous bags of sweets. Hans junior always took an active interest in young sportspeople, having attained a high national standard himself in badminton. In 1987 he set up the Hans Riegel Foundation, giving scholarships to students at 12 German universities. He was awarded one of Germany's highest honours, the Federal Cross of Merit, in 1994.

      "body": "<p>Hans Riegel, who has died aged 90 of heart failure, devoted his life to the company that bears one of the great names of confectionery \u2013 Haribo. Building up his family business into an international brand producing 100m sweets a day made him one of Germany's richest men.</p> <p>Johannes Peter Riegel, always known by the abbreviation Hans, was the elder son of Hans Riegel, who set up the business in 1920, registering it under an acronym derived from HAns RIegel BOnn. Hans senior set the tone for the future with a \"dancing bear\" sweet in 1922, and deliveries were made by his wife Gertrud, initially on a bicycle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-420249391\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382008962495/hans-riegel-001.jpg\" alt=\"hans riegel\" width=\"220\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hans Riegel continued to go to the office every day, as he had done for almost 70 years. Photograph: Rolf Vennenbernd/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1945 Hans senior died, and upon returning to Bonn from Allied prisoner-of-war camps, Hans junior and his younger brother, Paul, resolved to revive and expand the family business, whose production plant remained largely undamaged. They changed the recipe of their gummy bear sweets to make them coloured and fruit-flavoured. Paul took charge of production and technical matters, while Hans, who had been studying economics at the University of Bonn, handled sales and marketing.</p> <p>The gummy bear proved an unstoppable success. When the brothers started, they had a workforce of about 30. Within five years it had grown to more than 1,000, and today Haribo employs some 6,000 people at 15 factories in several countries, including a base in Pontefract, West Yorkshire. Its takeover of Dunhills, maker of the liquorice buttons known as Pontefract cakes, was completed in 1994, one of a number of purchases that expanded the firm's range of products to more than 200. They are now sold in more than 100 countries and Haribo has an annual turnover exceeding \u00a31.6bn.</p> <p>Starmix is the ubiquitous Haribo product in the UK, but the most popular globally is the Gummi bear. In 2007, Hans ordered the expression on Gummi bears' faces \u2013 in Britain they are called Goldbears \u2013 to be changed from a scowl to a smile. <a href=\"http://haribo.bg/en/\" title=\"History on the Haribo website\">The company's phenomenal growth</a> is largely due to the efforts of Hans, a reader of children's magazines and keen adopter of television advertising and slogans, backed by Paul's contribution to quality and consistency.</p> <p>The business, despite the everyday modesty of its product, is an example of the kind of enterprise that made the postwar \"economic miracle\" in West Germany possible, through the Mittelstand, or small to medium-size enterprises. As the Riegels expanded the company, each owning 50% of the business, they proceeded with caution, chary of borrowing money or speculating. Today Haribo remains privately owned, its headquarters still in Bonn.</p> <p>When my family and I lived in the area in the 1970s, my elder daughter took part in a tradition started by Hans senior in 1936. She and her German schoolfriends would harvest horse chestnuts in autumn, gather them into sacks and drag them to the Haribo factory gate; they were intended as a seasonal treat for the deer on the nearby Riegel family estate. In exchange for the conkers, the children were given generous bags of sweets.</p> <p>Hans junior always took an active interest in young sportspeople, having attained a high national standard himself in badminton. In 1987 he set up the Hans Riegel Foundation, giving scholarships to students at 12 German universities. He was awarded one of Germany's highest honours, the Federal Cross of Merit, in 1994.</p> <p>A nephew, Hans-J\u00fcrgen Riegel, long accepted as the Haribo heir apparent, left the company in 2006, having failed to persuade the old man to hand over control and retire. Another nephew, Hans-Guido, remains with Haribo. Their uncle continued to go to the office every day, as he had done for almost 70 years, until he was treated for a brain tumour earlier this year.</p> <p>Riegel's marriage ended in divorce. Paul died in 2009.</p> <p>\u2022 Hans (Johannes) Peter Riegel, confectionery manufacturer, born 10 March 1923; died 15 October 2013</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's retailers returned to health last month as a property market revival spurred strong demand for new furniture and other household goods, according to official figures. After a 2.1% fall in August, the Office for National Statistics said retail sales rose by 0.7% month on month in September, excluding petrol sales, following a 3% surge in the purchase of homeware. The rise in furniture sales and household items was credited by many analysts to the buoyant mood in the housing market. After a short time-lag, the government's Help to Buy deposit insurance scheme and the Bank of England's funding for lending initiative, which has depressed mortgage rates, appear to have pushed up the number of transactions and the demand for homeware. The ONS said a look back over the previous three months revealed a period of growth, with retail sales up 1.5% quarter on quarter. \"This is the largest quarter-on-quarter rise since March 2008 when the economy as a whole was at its peak, before the economic downturn,\" it said. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said: \"Retail sales showed a welcome revival in September after dipping in August, adding further to mounting evidence that the economy grew strongly in the third quarter. The three months to September have been the best quarter the retail sector has seen the start of 2008, suggesting an encouraging lead-up to the all-important Christmas season.\" Consumer confidence, which has risen sharply in recent months largely because people have been busier at work, has driven incomes higher and provided greater job security, he said. \"Employment jumped higher in August, pushing the number of jobless benefits claimants down at the fastest rate since 1997. Rising house prices have added to the feel-good factor,\" he added. Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotia Bank, said that based on surveys of manufacturing, construction and services industries, GDP should rise by 1.2% quarter on quarter. The first estimate of GDP growth in the third quarter is published on 25 October and economists' estimates vary from 0.7% to 1.2%. \"It's just that lacklustre industrial production data, the soggy July monthly services reading and mediocre retail sales have undermined faith in a super-strong outcome,\" Clarke said. In an interview with the Guardian on Wednesday, Spencer Dale, the Bank of England's chief economist, pointed to a strong GDP number when he said the economy was \"growing at something like 3-4% annualised\". Dale said it was possible Threadneedle Street would raise interest rates as early as next year if the strength of the recovery was maintained.",

Osborne said it would pave the way for lower energy costs for British consumers. \"Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China \u2013 the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power,\" he said on Thursday. \"It means the potential of more investment and jobs in Britain, and lower long-term energy costs for consumers.\" The move followed an agreement reached earlier in the week which would see civil nuclear collaboration between the UK and China on investment, technology, construction and expertise. The government said that as well as supporting Chinese investment in the UK, the agreement would make sure that British companies including Rolls-Royce, International Nuclear Services, and engineering companies such as Mott MacDonald would be part of China's multibillion-pound new nuclear programme. The energy minister, Ed Davey, said over the weekend that Britain was \"extremely close\" to agreeing a deal with France's EDF Energy to build a new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset, with a Chinese company also expected to take part in the project. During his trip to China, Osborne also unveiled a new visa system to make it easier for Chinese business leaders and rich tourists to visit the UK. He also made a surprise decision to allow Chinese banks to set up more easily in the UK, which raised eyebrows among the cross-party Treasury select committee of MPs. Led by its chairman, Andrew Tyrie, the committee is seeking assurances that the chancellor consulted the City's regulatory bodies over the proposal to relax rules, and that they are satisfied with the plans.",
