First, in terms of lending in the UK, the combination will still be substantially less than half the size of the fifth largest bank. Second, a large building society, Nationwide, also operates in the same market; it has 15 million members versus the 6 million customers under the combined wings of CYBG and Virgin. The big banks, in other words, are probably not trembling in fear of an earthquake. Remember that Lloyds Banking Group last year quietly forked out a greater sum \u2013 \u00a31.9bn \u2013 to get bigger in credit cards by buying MBNA\u2019s UK operation and could call its expansion a modest bolt-on. Still, the CYBG-Virgin deal makes sense for the two parties involved. Both needed to do something. CYBG\u2019s two brands, Clydesdale and Yorkshire, do not travel well outside their home turf and the previous plan to create an entirely new digital brand, to be called B, sounded hopeful and expensive. It is safer to rebrand everything as Virgin, even at a cost of \u00a360m. On the Virgin side, both main engines are at risk of developing a splutter. On mortgages, the big lenders are feeling more aggressive now that their capital ratios are healthier. On credit cards, the game of chasing growth via zero-interest teaser rates probably has diminishing returns. CYBG is concentrated in personal accounts and small business lending, so the fit is excellent on paper. And the promised annual cost savings of \u00a3120m, to be secured for a one-off hit of \u00a3240m (on top of the rebranding bill), look decent \u2013 the figure is slightly more than the City expected. But it\u2019s no surprise to see that the clearest winner will be Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Enterprises, owner of the Virgin Money brand. Virgin Money was paying \u00a38m annually for the licence, but the sum under CYBG will rise to \u00a312m and then to \u00a315m, or more if turnover targets are met. One can admire Branson\u2019s skill in pushing his brand deeper into financial services \u2013 first with the Northern Rock deal, now with CYBG. Alternatively, it is depressing that, even in an age of supposed technological revolution, CYBG feels the need to write a fat cheque every year to the bearded one in order to get noticed. From the point of the banking beasts, the competitive landscape still looks solid. Ofwat as unprepared as water firms over \u2018beast of the east\u2019 The main finding from Ofwat\u2019s review of water companies\u2019 failures during the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d episode is that the regulatory system for compensating customers isn\u2019t up to scratch. Ofwat, naturally, took a few swings at the culprits for failing to run networks that could withstand the big freeze and rapid thaw. Severn Trent, South East Water, Southern Water and Thames have been told to produce plans to demonstrate how they would do better next time. But the revelation was that only \u00a37m has been paid to customers in compensation so far, a figure that was itself inflated because some firms paid more than statutory minimums. That is across 200,000 customers who Ofwat says were cut off from supply for more than four hours, including the 60,000 off for more than 12 hours. Why so little compensation. Well, the limits seem too low. A payment of up to \u00a3150 for 48 to 72 hours interruption seems inadequate for those obliged also to take time off work or arrange emergency childcare in cases where schools were closed. Ofwat says it is \u201cconcerned\u201d that current compensation range are \u201cnot reflective\u201d of the impact on customers and it will launch another review. Put another way, the regulator was as unprepared as the companies whose performance it is criticising. Wind-up or slip, Norwegian Air should exploit takeover talk Normal form is to keep your acquisition strategy secret until you are obliged to say something, but Carsten Spohr, chief executive of Lufthansa, seems bizarrely keen to spill the beans. \u201cEveryone in Europe is talking to everyone right now,\u201d he told German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. \u201cThere is another wave of consolidation. This means that we are also in contact with Norwegian.\u201d One assumes his interest in Norwegian Air is serious. The only alternative explanation is that Spohr is winding up Willie Walsh at IAG, owner of British Airways. IAG, owner of 4.6% of Norwegian, has made two approaches already and would be infuriated to lose out. In Norwegian shoes, you\u2019d exploit the competitive tension for all it\u2019s worth \u2013 and do it soon. At the current high oil price, tougher times lie ahead for smaller airlines.",

      "bodyText": "Households could be in line for much higher compensation payouts when their water is cut off following a damning watchdog report into supply failures during the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d weather events this year. Ofwat said multiple failings by privatised water companies left 200,000 households in England and Wales cut off, some for several days, yet the compensation payout totalled only \u00a37m. In a strongly worded rebuke to four of the main water companies \u2013 Thames Water, Severn Trent, Southern Water and South East Water \u2013 Rachel Fletcher, the chief executive of the water industry regulator, said customers had been badly let down. In late February and early March, blizzards, strong winds, drifting snow and bitter cold caused major disruption across the UK. However, Ofwat said that while many water companies in the north of England and Wales were properly prepared, those in the south were slow and reactive. \u201cMany customers were effectively left to fend for themselves, with local bodies and volunteers having to fill the gap,\u201d Fletcher said. She said that in too many areas there was \u201cradio silence on what was happening, [with] businesses shut down and customers forced to make long journeys to pick up bottled water\u201d. Ofwat suggested that the compensation payouts were inadequate to reflect the hardships some customers went through. It said: \u201cWe are concerned that the current compensation arrangements \u2013 the guaranteed standards scheme \u2013 are not reflective of the impact on customers of being without water for a prolonged period. We intend to launch a consultation by the end of July 2018 with a view to making proposals to revise the GSS.\u201d The four worst-performing companies have been ordered to produce a belt-and-braces review of their emergency planning by 28 September to ensure that households won\u2019t be left without water again when bad weather hits. Ofwat highlighted big differences between the speed and quality of response of water companies, despite similar or tougher weather conditions. \u201cFor example, Severn Trent and United Utilities share a border and faced similar weather conditions but their customers had extremely different experiences,\u201d it said. Research by the Consumer Council for Water suggested that almost three-quarters of customers who were affected did not receive alternative supplies of water. It added that many high-priority customers \u2013 such as schools, emergency services and councils \u2013 received little or no proactive communication before, during or after the weather events. Some companies were hindered by the large number of small bursts on customer premises. \u201cThis dispersed pattern of small bursts, combined with a lack of additional production availability, created major supply problems that were not picked up early enough by some companies,\u201d Ofwat said. However, the regulator dismissed arguments that the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d was a one-off weather event. Fletcher said: \u201cThe freeze and rapid thaw earlier this year was forecast and was not unprecedented. A number of water companies showed what can be done to serve customers in the face of bad weather. But too many companies were caught off-guard and let people down, causing real hardship as a result. Our report shows there is no excuse for this level of failure.\u201d Ofwat\u2019s analysis of the weather conditions found that while the 2018 freeze and thaw was severe, it was not unprecedented. \u201cIn fact, as recently as 2010-11 there was a more severe freeze and thaw,\u201d it said. Michael Roberts of Water UK, which represents the water companies, highlighted how the extreme weather resulted in only 3% of customers being affected. \u201cThe impact varied across the country, with Ofwat saying that fewer than 3% of all customers were affected,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re sorry to say that in some areas significant numbers of customers experienced disruption and hardship, and we are determined to prevent this happening again in future. \u201cSince 1989, water companies have invested around \u00a3150bn to keep improving the industry and as a result customers are now five times less likely to suffer from supply interruptions.\u201d Many of the problems with water supply only emerged as temperatures rose and the thaw prompted flooding. All households in London and the south-east were told to cut their water use, take short showers rather than baths and defer running washing machines and dishwashers.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The operator of Northern trains requested in January to defer the introduction of the rail timetable that has caused chaos across its network, but was refused by Network Rail and other train operators, it has emerged. However, executives from Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) told MPs that the scale of problems only became clear in the final three days before the timetable change, when drivers\u2019 rosters were drawn up. Rail bosses were questioned by a Commons transport select committee whose chair, Lilian Greenwood, presented accounts from commuters of five weeks of widespread cancellations, disruption and delays \u2013 including several people who lost income and jobs, and parents who no longer saw their children because of erratic and prolonged journeys. David Brown, the managing director of Arriva Rail North, which runs Northern, said his company was on course to deliver its timetable with enough trained drivers until 5 January, when Network Rail said it would not have finished electrification of a key route. \u201cThat meant we had to re-plan it in 16 weeks rather than 40 weeks. We did request that the timetable be rolled forward but it was declined.\u201d He said a \u201csignificant number of other players\u201d rejected the request for a delay, which was taken at a north of England programme board including Network Rail and Department for Transport officials. A further engineering delay in April left 450 more drivers requiring additional training, Brown said, which caused more cancellations. The committee was told a decision \u201cultimately taken by ministers\u201d in October 2017 to phase in changes meant an original timetable was rewritten, leaving GTR with a finalised timetable three weeks rather than 12 in advance, according to Charles Horton, the chief executive of GTR. Horton, who announced his resignation on Friday, said: \u201cIt was a systemic failing which has had the devastating consequences that you have outlined on our customers.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m terribly sad and terribly sorry it\u2019s ended as it has.\u201d Horton said they had tried to mitigate problems but it was only in the final week that they became aware of the lack of trained drivers. Nick Brown, the chief operating officer of GTR, said there was a \u201cmismatch of quantity and locations that caught us in the last couple of days\u201d. However, he said that on 4 May GTR had flagged that the changeover was \u201chigh risk\u201d to an industry readiness board. To date, about 13,000 GTR trains and 8,000 Northern services have been cancelled or run significantly late since the new timetable was installed. Labour will on Tuesday in the Commons seek to force a no-confidence vote in Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, over his handling of the timetable chaos and franchising in the railways.",

      "bodyText": "Underemployment, which mostly measures part-time workers who want to work more hours, was long seen as a second-order issue. But as the wages of all workers struggle to rise by more than inflation, the level of underemployment has become in some ways more important than unemployment \u2013 and it is an issue that is widespread across genders and areas of the country. One reason underemployment was not considered much of an issue was because it moved pretty much in line with unemployment. Through the good times of the mining boom, the bad times of the GFC and even the slow, mediocre recovery, underemployment rose and fell in line with unemployment. It was simple \u2013 you don\u2019t need to worry about underemployment specifically when doing things that reduce unemployment will in turn reduce underemployment. And then in 2015 it all went rather askew. The unemployment rate began to fall, and underemployment rose. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday We now have a situation where the level of underemployment is not far below record highs \u2013 and higher than anything seen before 2015 \u2013 while the unemployment rate is lower than it has been for the past five years: Consider that in February 2013, when the unemployment rate was also at the current rate of 5.4%, the underemployment rate was 7.3%, compared with the current level of 8.5%. But given this is still mostly about part-time workers wanting more hours, why is it a big issue? Most people who work part-time are happy with the level of hours they get \u2013 only around 25%-30% want more hours and they, on average, want to work around 13 and a half more hours a week (underemployed men on average want to work a couple more hours a week more than women do). The reason this is a big issue is those extra desired hours are a measure of spare capacity in the labour market. The more people who want to work more hours, the fewer people need to be hired to do new jobs \u2013 employers can (should they wish) just give more hours to those already working for them, and they don\u2019t need to increase the hourly wage to entice them to work more hours. It is why spare capacity is a strong determinant of wage growth and why underemployment at the moment is a much better gauge of how wages will rise than unemployment: So what is driving this rise in underemployment? Unfortunately it is rather widespread, both in terms of age, gender and geography. Because women are more likely to work part-time, their underemployment rate is higher (because it is calculated as a percentage of all men and women in the labour force): But in general, men who work part-time are more likely to want to work more hours compared with women. So when the level of male part-time employment rises, it has a bigger effect on underemployment, and there has been a strong rise in part-time male employment in the past decade. But women remain the biggest drivers of total underemployment. Since the middle of 2015, when the level of unemployment and underemployment began to split, women aged 15-24 have accounted for the largest share of the growth of underemployed workers. Just over a quarter of the increase in underemployment comes from that segment of workers. And while this not a surprise, given they are largest segments of overall underemployed, they have contributed more than would be expected. Women aged 25-34 and 45-54 have also contributed more to the number of underemployed in the past three years than would have been expected but, somewhat surprisingly, underemployment actually fell for women aged 25-34 and those aged over 55 \u2013 the only two age groups to see underemployment go down: And two of the groups who over-contributed to the growth of underemployment have been men \u2013 those aged over 55, who make up just 7% of all underemployed accounted for 21% of the growth of underemployment since May 2015. Similarly, men aged 35-44 make up a mere 5.7% of all underemployed but 12.4% of the growth in underemployment over the past three years. So it is not just an issue of worrying about women workers in the two industries that have the highest level of underemployment \u2013 the retail trade and accommodation and food services. And it is not just an issue related to a certain area, although the mining states of Western Australia and Queensland have seen their underemployment rates rise since May 2015, while others have remained steady or seen some slight falls: This suggests we could just see it as an issue mostly about the end of the mining boom. For if we exclude WA and Queensland, the \u201cnational\u201d rate of underemployment falls from 8.5% to 8.1%: But just excluding WA and Queensland does not remove the problem, because the unemployment rate would also be lower if we excluded those two states \u2013 5.1% instead of 5.4%. And when we look at the relationship of unemployment and underemployment even when we exclude the two mining states, we see, if anything, a worse split from 2015 onwards: The unemployment rate, excluding the mining states, of 5.1% is as low as it has been since February 2011, and yet the relative underemployment rate of 8.1% is higher than it has been anytime before the middle of 2014. Since February 2015, the unemployment rate of the non-mining states has fallen 1.2% points while the underemployment rate in that time has fallen just 0.5% points. It adds up to a nationwide, all-encompassing issue. And one that needs to be addressed if all of us are to start seeing our wages grow by more than they have over the past three years. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

    "webTitle": "KPMG singled out in critical report on audit industry", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "KPMG, the accounting firm that signed off the books in the years leading up to Carillion\u2019s collapse, has been singled out by the industry regulator in a report that says the overall quality of the audit profession is in decline. The Financial Reporting Council, the watchdog for the UK\u2019s accountants, said the profession had demonstrated a \u201cfailure to challenge management and show appropriate scepticism across their audits\u201d. There have been calls for the \u201cbig four\u201d accountants \u2013 KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, EY and Deloitte \u2013 to be broken up to spur competition and improve standards. All four gave Carillion financial advice before the construction and outsourcing company failed. MPs accused the four of \u201cfeasting\u201d on Carillion, whose finances proved far less healthy than directors had suggested. The FRC reported a decline in the quality of the work of all four, with KPMG performing the worst. The watchdog is already investigating KPMG over its role in the collapse of Carillion and it said on Monday there had been an \u201cunacceptable deterioration\u201d in the quality of its work. The FRC cited figures that showed half of KPMG\u2019s audits of firms in the FTSE350 index had required \u201cmore than just limited\u201d improvements, up from 35% in the previous year. \u201cThe overall quality of the audits inspected in the year, and indeed the decline in quality over the past five years, is unacceptable and reflects badly on the action taken by the previous leadership, not just on the performance of frontline teams,\u201d the regulator said. \u201cOur key concern is the extent of challenge of management and exercise of professional scepticism by audit teams, both being critical attributes of an effective audit, and more generally the inconsistent execution of audits within the firm.\u201d It added: \u201c[KPMG] agrees that its efforts in recent years have not been sufficient; the FRC will hold KPMG\u2019s new leadership to account for the success of their work to improve audit quality.\u201d Stephen Haddrill, the chief executive of the regulator, said: \u201cAt a time when public trust in business and in audit is in the spotlight, the big four must improve the quality of their audits and do so quickly. They must address urgently several factors that are vital to audit, including the level of challenge and scepticism by auditors, in particular in their bank audits. \u201cWe also expect improvements in group audits and in the audit of pension balances. Firms must strenuously renew their efforts to improve audit quality to meet the legitimate expectation of investors and other stakeholders.\u201d Michelle Hinchliffe, the head of audit at KPMG, said the firm was disappointed with its audit quality score, adding: \u201cWe are taking action to resolve this ... we cannot and will not be satisfied with these results and, as a firm, we are already working to put this right.\u201d The FRC was heavily criticised in a report by MPs on two select committees investigating the collapse of Carillion. The report said the FRC was \u201cfar too passive\u201d in monitoring Carillion and called for a change in culture at the regulator. The FRC said it would now scrutinise KPMG more closely as a result of its findings. It will inspect 25% more KPMG audits than before and monitor the firm\u2019s plans to improve the quality of its work. In the FRC\u2019s overall assessment of eight accountants, it found that 72% of audits of all firms, including those outside the FTSE350, required no more than limited improvement, down from 78% last year. While only half of KPMG\u2019s FTSE350 audits were deemed satisfactory, rivals scored far higher, although all showed declines and fell short of the FRC\u2019s target of 90%. Deloitte scored 79%, down from 82% last year, EY fell from 92% to 82% and PwC was down from 90% to 84%. The four firms immediately below the big four \u2013 BDO, Mazars, GT and Moore Stephens \u2013 were told that the quality of their audits had generally improved.",

    "webTitle": "Clydesdale and Yorkshire bank brands to go in takeover of Virgin Money", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Clydesdale and Yorkshire bank brands are set to disappear from high streets after Virgin Money agreed to a \u00a31.7bn takeover by the owner of the two institutions that will lead to the loss of more than 1,500 jobs. Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG) will combine with Virgin Money to create the UK\u2019s sixth-largest bank, with 6 million personal and small business customers, and total lending of \u00a370bn. While it is CYBG in the driving seat, it is the Virgin Money brand that customers will see in future. The deal signals the end of a high street presence for the Clydesdale Bank brand, which was established in Glasgow in 1838, and its sister brand Yorkshire Bank, which was founded in Halifax in 1859. There are 70 Clydesdale Bank branches and 97 Yorkshire Bank outlets. The deal also prompted online speculation that because Clydesdale is one of only a small number of banks worldwide that issues its own banknotes, there could soon be Virgin Money notes \u2013 perhaps even featuring a portrait of Sir Richard Branson \u2013 circulating in Scotland. However, the bank note-issuing licence is in Clydesdale\u2019s name and CYBG has indicated there are no plans to make changes to the notes. The takeover brings together the UK\u2019s two largest challenger banks, creating what the companies claim will be the first true national competitor to the big five (HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander) \u2013 twice as big as the nearest challenger bank, TSB. Jim Pettigrew, the CYBG chairman, said: \u201cIt is clear to us that the combined group can transform the UK banking landscape and offer real benefits to customers and communities throughout the UK.\u201d CYBG said it was committed to moving all of its retail customer business over to the Virgin Money brand. It is theoretically possible that the Clydesdale and Yorkshire brands could be retained for the group\u2019s small and medium-sized business banking division as the Virgin brand is to be tested out on these customers. The rebranding will cost \u00a360m. However, there were early indications that the name change will not go down well with some customers in Scotland and Yorkshire. On Twitter, John Lindley said: \u201cClydesdale and Virgin Money \u2013 don\u2019t you dare get rid of the Yorkshire Bank name. We\u2019re more than a brand!\u201d Meanwhile, Charley said: \u201cNot happy about you being rebranded to Virgin Money, been a customer for 40yrs. Clydesdale name iconic.\u201d Job cuts feature heavily in the \u00a3120m in annual savings earmarked under the deal, with a 16% reduction in the combined 9,500-strong workforce. The banks declined to say how many of the combined group\u2019s 250 branches would be closed, although CYGB executives downplayed the prospect of closures because there is little overlap between their branch networks. The plan is to keep Virgin Money\u2019s head office in Gosforth, Newcastle, for at least three years. Its chief executive, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, who has led the bank for more than 10 years and is one of the most high-profile women in British finance, will become a senior adviser for an undetermined period of time to the CYBG boss, David Duffy, who takes the reins of the combined company. Virgin Money was founded in 1995 by Branson, who owns a 35% stake, which will fall to 13.1% in the merged company. The sale comes seven years after he led a controversial \u00a3747m buyout of Northern Rock after its rescue by the taxpayer. CYBG has agreed to license the Virgin Money brand for \u00a312m a year initially, going up to \u00a315m in the fourth year, and will also pay additional royalties equivalent to 1% of revenues from the fifth year. The royalties go to Branson. Gadhia will walk away with a \u00a312.5m paper profit following the all-share deal, which will lead to her exchanging 3.4m shares for CYBG stock. It is unclear when she can sell her shares, with 1.3m unvested and most of them dependent on the firm\u2019s performance. The Unite union said news of the job losses would come as a shock to staff across the country who had found out through the media and said it was seeking an urgent meeting with Duffy. Duffy said: \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty historic day for CYBG and Virgin Money.\u201d He added that the combined company would offer the full scale of products and services, combining Virgin Money\u2019s strength in mortgages, credit cards and investments with CYBG\u2019s small and mid-sized business banking. CYBG is paying 1.2125 new shares in exchange for each Virgin Money share. Based on Friday\u2019s closing price of 306p, this values each Virgin Money share at 371p. CYBG clinched the deal after offering Virgin Money shareholders a larger stake in the combined group, of 38%. Nick Cooper, the executive director of analytics at Landor branding consultancy, said: \u201cWhen this deal is complete it will give Virgin Money the scale that it currently lacks and could propel the brand into a position from where it can really challenge the established high street lenders.\u201d After the recent fiasco at TSB caused by a botched IT migration, CYBG stressed that there would be no \u201cbig bang\u201d move of Virgin Money customers to its platform on day one. The transfer will be phased over three years.",

    "webTitle": "UK facing weakest growth since 2009; Audi CEO arrested over dieselgate scandal - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Investors have been rattled by the escalation of the trade dispute between the US and China, pushing stock markets lower once more. On top of that come concerns about the political situation in Germany, with the issue of immigration putting pressure on the country\u2019s coalition government. But signs of optimism over the issue has seen markets come off their worst levels. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged, down just 0.03% or 2.58 points at 7631.33 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.36% to 12,834.11 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.93% at 5450.48 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.41% to 22,099.27 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.83% lower at 9769.4 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 168 points or 0.67%. Elsewhere, on a quiet day for corporate and economic news, Britain\u2019s bosses warned the UK economy was facing its weakest growth since 2009, a bigger UK challenger bank emerged as Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group took over Virgin Money, and the boss of VW\u2019s Audi division was arrested following the Dieselgate scandal. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Global markets have started the week on a weak footing, as trade fears continue to play the primary role in determining market sentiment. With both the US and China set to impose a raft of tariffs on 6 July, there is likely to be an increasingly unstable and anxious market environment as we progress towards that deadline.... However, equally as important is the huge uncertainty we are seeing build in Germany, with Angela Merkel clashing with the leader of their coalition partner (CSU) over her stance on immigration. It is no doubt that immigration remains Merkel\u2019s Achilles heel, and with the chancellor desperate to maintain a coalition to maintain her dominance over German politics, markets are understandably jittery at the thought of any political upheaval in the biggest economy in Europe. Markets are still in the red, amid US-China trade fears and worries about the political situation in Germany. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Things got pretty ugly after the US open, the Dow Jones following in the footsteps of its Eurozone peers by posting some heavy losses. The Dow plunged 240 points as the session got underway, a sharp decline that took it back below 24850 and to its worst price in 12 days. The index is struggling under the weight of the escalating US-China trade war, with Trump\u2019s decision to push forward with tariffs on Beijing last Friday causing another nasty flare-up of international posturing. The Eurozone indices, softened up by the trade war stuff, found themselves incredibly susceptible to the political problems in Germany, with the clash between the CDU and CSU bloodying the region\u2019s trading rooms. The DAX dropped 1.8%, wiping out the post-ECB growth seen last week, and leaving it struggling to hold above 12800; the CAC was in-step with its German sibling, falling 1.6%, with the IBEX down 1.1% and the FTSE MIB slipping 0.6%. Though still at its worst intraday price since the end of May, shedding half a percent to return to 7600, the FTSE managed to avoid the pain seen elsewhere. That\u2019s likely because Brent Crude rebounded by 1.3%, lifting BP and Shell alongside it, while the pound fell 0.3% against both the dollar and the euro as it speculates about Thursday\u2019s Bank of England meeting. The pound has come under pressure amid the latest Brexit developments - peers are currently debating the EU withdrawal bill which can be followed in our politics live blog - and ahead of the latest Bank of England meeting on Thursday. With the Bank widely expected to leave interest rates on hold, the pound has slipped 0.32% against the dollar to $1.3240 having earlier fallen as low as $1.3227. Dan Smith, investment analyst at Thomas Miller Investment, said: The Bank of England (BoE) holds a monetary policy meeting this Thursday (21 June) and is widely expected to make no change to interest rates. Incoming data continues to show that the UK economy is not firing on all cylinders. Consumer spending, employment and business confidence surveys have been fairly solid and supportive of growth, whilst industrial production and manufacturing have been exceptionally weak. The minutes of the meeting will be closely scrutinised to see whether policy members sit on the optimistic or pessimistic side of the fence in regards to recent data, with the tone of the minutes likely to set expectations over the possibility of an interest rate rise in August. The increased trade tensions between the US and China continue to unnerve investors, with Wall Street falling sharply at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 238 points or 0.95% while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both opened almost 0.7% lower. Elsewhere the oil price is heading higher ahead of a key meeting of Opec later this week. Brent crude is currently up 1% at $74.18 a barrel, recovering some of its recent losses. Saudi Arabia and Russia had been widely expected to agree to increase production, boosting supplies and lowering prices. But talk that this may not happen after all - or perhaps not by as much as previously expected - has halted the slide in crude. On top of that, the escalation of the trade dispute between the US and China has also helped lift prices by raising new concerns about its effect on global growth, and thus demand for oil. The arrest of Audi\u2019s chief executive does not mean the truth about Dieselgate is any closer, says consumer rights law firm Your Lawyers, which is leading the steering committe for a group litigation order against Volkswagen. The firm\u2019s director Aman Johal said: Audi CEO Rupert Stadler\u2019s arrest and investigation over fraud and false advertising indicates that we may still be no closer to the full extent of the truth behind the Volkswagen Group\u2019s Dieselgate scandal. Stadler is one of 20 suspects being investigated at Audi for false claims about its diesel vehicles. Perhaps the widening probes will lead to greater clarity on how the automotive giant was able to cheat customers around the world, and which individuals within the VW Group are personally responsible. There are around 60,000 people in the UK that are calling for justice against Volkswagen as part of a class action claim that our firm is on the Steering Committee for, but owners only have until 26 October 2018 to make their case. Unless Volkswagen chooses to do the right thing by its customers and pay compensation, we will pursue them for justice in the High Court. We will be closely monitoring Stadler\u2019s case and will continue to fight for justice for Volkswagen\u2019s victims. German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports that Audi\u2019s board will soon appoint an interim chief executive, following Rupert Stadler\u2019s arrest this morning. The appointment will be made at a supervisory board meeting convened at short notice on Monday. Audi insists that \u201cthe presumption of innocence remains in place for Mr. Stadler\u201d, but the company also recognises that an interim replacement is now needed. More here The Volkswagen emissions scandal centred on the use of \u201cdefeat devices,\u201d which allowed VW cars to recognise when they were being tested in the lab and enter a low-emissions mode. Otherwise, they would generate more pollution than permitted under EU and US rules, but also provide higher performance. Volkswagen tied to pin the blame on a couple of rogue software engineers, but prosecutors believe the scandal runs deeper. Last summer, VW engineer James Liang was jailed for 40 months in America, and fined $200,000, after admitting helping to design software to cheat US emission tests. Liang had led VW\u2019s Diesel Competence unit in the US. Associated Press reports that 20 people are under suspicion in the Audi probe, adding: Volkswagen has pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the United States and nine managers, including former CEO Martin Winterkorn, were charged there. Two are serving prison terms; Winterkorn and the others remained in Germany and are unlikely to be extradited. German news agency DPA is reporting that German prosecutors arrested Rupert Stadler on fears that he might undermine the ongoing investigation into the VW diesel emissions scandal. The investigation is focused on claims that Audi sold at least 210,000 diesel-engine cars fitted with cheat software in the United States and Europe over several years. Last summer, Audi diesel engine engineer Giovanni Pamio was arrested by Munich\u2019s prosecutors, and then charged by US authorities over the scandal. Shares in Volkswagen have fallen 2% in Frankfurt, following Stadler\u2019s arrest (Audi is one of VW\u2019s biggest divisions) More details of Audi CEO Rupert Stadler\u2019s arrest are coming in. He was detained at his home in Ingolstadt, the Bavarian city, in the early hours of this morning, prosecutors say. This makes Stadler the most senior Volkswagen executives arrested since the German carmaker was caught rigging diesel emission tests. The Munich prosecutor\u2019s office says: \u201cAs part of an investigation into diesel affairs and Audi engines, the Munich prosecutor\u2019s office executed an arrest warrant against Mr Professor Rupert Stadler on June 18, 2018,\u201d Newsflash: Over in Germany, the boss of automaker Audi has been arrested by police investigating the emissions scandal. Audi chief executive Rupert Stadler was detained this morning, according to parent company Volkswagen. A VW spokesman told Reuters: \u201cWe confirm that Mr Stadler was arrested this morning. The hearing to determine whether he will be remanded is ongoing.\u201d The arrest comes a week after prosecutors raided Stadler\u2019s apartment, as they widened the investigation into how Volkswagen used \u2018cheat software\u2019 in its cars to trick emissions tests. Last month, Audi admitted that another 60,000 A6 and A7 models with diesel engines have emission software issues -- further deepening a scandal that began in 2015. David Madden, CMC Markets analyst, says investors are \u201ccaught in the middle\u201d between the US and China. Stock markets are broadly lower today as traders are increasingly worried about the prospect of a trade war. Tensions between the US and China are escalating, and we are not any closer to an agreement being reached. We are expecting the Dow Jones to open down 115 points at 24,975 and we are calling the S&amp;P 500 down 9 points at 2,770. Back in the UK, the takeover battle for Virgin Money is over -- putting hundreds of jobs at risk. Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG) has sealed a \u00a31.7bn deal to merge with Virgin, turning two small challenger banks into one larger one. The move could be a blow to the North East economy, where Virgin owns many of Northern Rock\u2019s assets. My colleague Julia Kollowe explains: Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG) and Virgin Money have agreed to create the UK\u2019s sixth-largest bank, with 6 million personal and small business customers and total lending of \u00a370bn. The banks expect to make \u00a3120m of annual savings by by 2021 by reducing overlap between their operations. This will result in a 16% reduction in the combined group\u2019s 9,500-strong workforce that CYBG hopes to achieve by attrition \u2013 that is, when people leave they will not be replaced. It declined to say how many of the combined group\u2019s 250 branches will be closed. However, the plan is to retain Virgin Money\u2019s head office in Gosforth, Newcastle, for at least three years. More here: European stock markets have started the week on the back foot, as fears of a global trade war intensify. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe\u2019s largest companies, has dropped by 0.5% after America and China imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on Friday. Chinese media have launched a stinging attack on Trump, calling his government \u201cselfish\u201d and \u201crude\u201d for imposing new charges on imports from China China\u2019s Global Times said Beijing had no choice but to retaliate: \u201cIt reinforces the difference in images of the two countries: one challenges the foundation of global trade through sudden attacks; and one that is prepared to defend itself in a trade war that it cannot avoid.\u201d Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says markets are finally beginning to wake up to the risks of a global trade war. The negotiating style of President Trump had allowed investors to assume that his threats were hyperbole and part of his unique diplomatic style, and that he would step away from the brink rather than risk undermining the positive impact his previous policies have had on the stock market. However, the US decision to press forward and take on China makes the risks far more pronounced and the real danger is that the Chinese retaliation may start a chain reaction that is difficult to stop \u2013 especially as Trump likes to have the last word. The current position on tariffs is unlikely to cause a full-blown rout for markets, but the prospect of further escalation and reprisals could cause considerable damage to the global economy, increasing the risks and anxiety. In another sign of economic weakness, London house prices have fallen for the 10th month in a row. Rightmove reports that asking prices in the capital are down 0.9% compared with May, and are 1.0% lower than a year ago. That\u2019s the 10th monthly fall in a row, as the once-hot London property market continues to cool. London is particularly vulnerable to the threat of a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019, as tens of thousands of financial jobs could be lost. Prices have dropped particularly sharply in the centre over the last 12 months (although the average property is still priced north of \u00a31.3m). Property prices in the north are still rising, though, helping to push the national asking price up by 0.4% this month. Lack of supply in Northern areas is helping to keep prices up, says Miles Shipside, Rightmove director and housing market analyst: \u201cThe reduction in property choice for buyers in the north compared to a year ago is a result of property for sale being snapped up, meaning it\u2019s more of a sellers\u2019 market there. In marked contrast the jump in buyer choice in southern regions shows there are signs of a sellers\u2019 market in some areas.\u201d Here are all the key points from the British Chamber of Commerce\u2019s new economic forecasts: UK GDP growth forecast for 2018 is downgraded from 1.4% to 1.3%, down from 1.5% to 1.4% in 2019, rising to 1.6% in 2020 (unchanged) Quarter-on-quarter GDP growth is forecast to rise by 0.4% in Q2 2018, from 0.1% growth in Q1. Growth in household consumption for 2018 is expected to slow to 1.0%, before rising to 1.4% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020 Inflation will continue to ease, but will not fall below the 2% target until 2020. The next interest rate rise, by 0.25%, is forecast to occur in Q4 2018, followed by a further increase to 1.0% in Q2 2019, with no further rises expected over the remainder of the forecast period Unemployment will remain at 4.4% in 2018, rising to 4.5% in 2019 and 2010 Average earnings growth will continue to slightly outpace inflation over the forecast period, with growth of 2.7%, 2.9%, and 3.0%, compared with inflation of 2.5%, 2.3%, and 1.9% Export growth of 2.8% in 2018, 2.9% in 2019, and 2.9% in 2020 is expected. This compares with import growth of 1.7% in 2018, 2.5% in 2019, and 3.0% in 2020 Growth in the construction sector is expected to slow significantly in 2018, with 0.7% growth, compared to 5.7% in 2017. The sector picks up slightly in the remainder of the forecast period, with 1.3% and 1.5% in 2019 and 2020 respectively Services sector growth is expected to slow to 1.2% in 2018, before picking up to 1.5% in 2019 and 1.9% in 2020 Business investment is expected to remain weak, with growth across the forecast period of 0.9% in 2018, 1.2% in 2019, and 1.7% in 2020 The BCC\u2019s gloomy forecasts could actually be too optimistic, if the Brexit process ends messily or if Donald Trump manages to create a full-blown trade war. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, explains that the UK is vulnerable to external shocks: \u201cWhile Brexit uncertainty and the weakness in sterling have weighed on overall UK growth, it is the failure to deal with the longstanding structural issues from weak productivity to the deep imbalances in the UK economy that continue to undermine the UK\u2019s growth potential. \u201cThe risks to the outlook are on the downside. A messy departure from the EU would likely slow UK GDP growth further over the medium term. The prospect of an escalating trade war is now a key downside risk to our forecast as it could mean much weaker export and business investment growth than implied by the current forecast. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain is facing its weakest growth since the financial crisis, as uncertainty over Brexit and fears of a global trade war hit confidence. So warns the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), which has just downgraded its growth forecast for the UK. It fears that consumer spending, business investment and trade are all weakening, leading to weak wage growth and stretched households. In short, Britain is trapped in a \u2018torpor\u2019, it warns, with growth expect to fall to just 1.3% this year. That would be the weakest performance since 2009 (down from a previous forecast of 1.4%). The service sector is expected to struggle, with growth slowing to 1.2% in 2018 (that would be the weakest outturn since 2010.) The BCC has also cut its forecast for 2019 from 1.5% to 1.4%. It predicts that Britain\u2019s net trade position will weaken in the next few years, as exporters struggle but imports pick up. Adam Marshall, director general of the BCC, says the government must act to help businesses through the \u2018testing times\u2019 ahead: \u201cA decade on from the start of the financial crisis, the UK now faces another extended period of weak growth amidst a backdrop of both domestic and global uncertainty. \u201cOur forecast should serve as a wake-up call to government - as it demonstrates that \u2018business as usual\u2019 is not an option when it comes to the economy. \u201cWith firms facing ongoing Brexit uncertainty, increasing global protectionism and instability in some parts of the world that will impact on costs and profits, now is the time for more robust action to support business confidence and investment. Marshall also warns that MPs can\u2019t simply fixate on Brexit, given the other problems in the country: Businesses across the country want to see far more urgency around fixing the fundamentals here at home and a concerted effort to lower the high costs of doing business. Also coming up today... Tensions between the US and China are rising, after president Trump approved tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods last Friday. China swiftly hit back by imposing its own tariffs on US products. These geopolitical tensions are weighing on the markets; Europe\u2019s Stoxx 500 index has dropped by 0.3% in early trading after losses in Asia. European investors should also keep an eye on Germany, where a deepening row over migration could bring down the government. Angela Merkel is refusing to bow to pressure from her own interior minister to turn away asylum-seekers who have registered in other European countries. Merkel hopes to find a Europe-wide solution, but pressure is building on the chancellor. Otherwise it looks like a quiet day, leaving the City free to anticipate England\u2019s opening World Cup game (KO: 7pm BST).",

That would be the weakest performance since 2009 (down from a previous forecast of 1.4%).</p> <p>The service sector is expected to struggle, with growth slowing to 1.2% in 2018 (that would be the weakest outturn since 2010.)</p> <p>The BCC has also cut its forecast for 2019 from 1.5% to 1.4%. It predicts that Britain\u2019s net trade position will weaken in the next few years, as exporters struggle but imports pick up.<br></p> <p><strong>Adam Marshall, </strong>director general of the BCC, says the government must act to help businesses through the \u2018testing times\u2019 ahead:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cA decade on from the start of the financial crisis, the UK now faces another extended period of weak growth amidst a backdrop of both domestic and global uncertainty. </p> <p>\u201cOur forecast should serve as a wake-up call to government - as it demonstrates that \u2018business as usual\u2019 is not an option when it comes to the economy. </p> <p>\u201cWith firms facing ongoing Brexit uncertainty, increasing global protectionism and instability in some parts of the world that will impact on costs and profits, now is the time for more robust action to support business confidence and investment. </p> </blockquote> <p>Marshall also warns that MPs can\u2019t simply fixate on Brexit, given the other problems in the country:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Businesses across the country want to see far more urgency around fixing the fundamentals here at home and a concerted effort to lower the high costs of doing business. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Also coming up today...</h2> <p>Tensions between the US and China are rising, after president Trump approved tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods last Friday.

      "bodyText": "The European commission is refusing to agree to any back-channel discussions between UK and EU aviation agencies to avert a crisis in the event of a \u201cno-deal\u201d outcome to Brexit. Attempts by the aerospace industry to persuade Brussels to start contingency talks to ensure Europe\u2019s planes keep flying and the aerospace industry can function effectively have apparently been rebuffed by the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, according to industry sources. At the strike of midnight in Brussels on 29 March 2019, when Britain leaves the EU, UK-made parts for planes will no longer be legally valid and its pilot licences will be defunct in the eyes of international regulators acting under agreements with the bloc. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association and the UK aerospace group ADS wrote to Barnier earlier this month to warn that the current approach would impact not only Britain but could damage the whole of the \u00a3193bn EU aerospace and defence industry. They have called for the European Aviation and Safety Agency (EASA) and the UK\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to immediately open discussions on a way forward in the event of the breakdown of wider talks in Brussels. Their letter to the commission warns: \u201cOur risk analysis concludes that EASA and the CAA need to urgently begin technical and contingency planning discussions by the June European council, and separate to the political negotiations.\u201d It added: \u201cWithout an agreed solution ... supply chain disruption across Europe will occur, parts will be unable to be delivered, pilots and maintenance technicians will be unable to work, aerospace companies in the UK will lose foreign validations for their business, and aircraft will be grounded globally.\u201d An industry source told the Times that the commission was putting politics above the interests of the people it is supposed to represent. \u201cThis is purely about a negotiating strategy,\u201d the source was reported to have said. The UK is currently a member of an aviation agreement based on 35 shared pieces of EU legislation, a common regulator in EASA, and a court acting as a referee on the shared rules, the European court of justice. British ministers have insisted they want the UK to remain in EASA, but despite confident assurances in April, there has been no EU agreement, further alarming the aviation sector. An ADS spokesman said that even should a transition agreement be achieved, months of technical discussions could still be needed to avoid potential issues for the industry in March 2019. A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWe want to explore with the EU the terms on which the UK could remain part of EU agencies such as those that are critical to the aerospace industries. Doing so would be in the best interests of the UK and EU.\u201d Beyond the impact on manufacturers, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, UK carriers would also lose all their flying rights under agreements with member states and third countries as they would no longer be considered EU airlines. While Brussels is open to a new aviation agreement, it is not willing to negotiate a deal with the UK that could emulate the status quo. UK carriers, such as easyJet, have been told they will have to be 50% owned and controlled by EU nationals to enjoy the continued right to fly between destinations within the bloc. They will also need to be headquartered in a EU member state. EasyJet has established a new company, easyJet Europe, in Austria, to maintain flying rights.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s pledge to spend an extra \u00a320bn a year on the NHS by 2023-24 has left the government struggling to explain how the health service\u2019s 70th \u201cbirthday present\u201d will be funded. A number of questions arise from the announcement. 1) How much will a Brexit dividend contribute? In theory, diverting money that goes to the EU for the NHS could pay for almost half the extra cash. That is because the UK\u2019s net contributions to the EU are in the region of \u00a39bn a year. In practice, the prime minister cannot rely on the Brexit dividend. There are three reasons for that. First, the government has already earmarked the Brexit dividend for other purposes \u2013 to match the financial support given at the moment by Brussels to farmers and science, for example. Second, the UK has agreed to pay the EU a divorce settlement, which the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates will be \u00a337bn. Finally, slower growth may result in weaker tax receipts. There is much debate about the impact of Brexit on the economy but the OBR\u2019s view \u2013 accepted by the Treasury \u2013 is that the public finances will be weakened by \u00a315bn a year. 2) How will the pledge affect the government\u2019s deficit targets? Extra borrowing is likely to account for up to \u00a310bn of the additional health spending, which will further delay the government\u2019s aim of putting the public finances back in the black. The Treasury\u2019s fiscal rules say the UK should be in budget surplus by the middle of the next decade, described by the OBR as \u201cchallenging\u201d even before the NHS announcement. Faster growth will be needed if the target is to be met. 3) Are further spending cuts an option? Not really. The NHS and overseas aid budgets have been ringfenced since 2010 but other Whitehall departments have experienced deep cuts in their budgets, amounting to up to 40% in real terms for justice and work and pensions in the decade to 2020. Many parts of the public sector are struggling to cope with a prolonged period of austerity and \u00a312bn is already being taken out of the annual welfare bill. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says the pressures on public services are \u201cundeniable\u201d and will need to be addressed. That means spending in areas other than health is likely to go up rather than down. 4) Theresa May says we will have to \u201ccontribute a bit more\u201d but will taxes have to rise significantly? It is not a question of whether taxes will go up in the autumn budget to pay for the NHS spending boost but by how much. Philip Hammond is considering all options, including deferring cuts in corporation tax (which would raise just over \u00a35bn according to the IFS) and freezing income tax and national insurance thresholds (\u00a33.5bn). The chancellor has doubts about an increase in national insurance contributions that would be earmarked exclusively for the NHS. 5) Is \u00a320bn extra per year enough? Almost certainly not. Since the NHS was set up in 1948 its annual budget has increased by 3.7% a year once inflation has been taken into account. May\u2019s pledge would result in day-to-day health spending rising by 3.3% a year, enough to keep health provision at current levels but not enough to cope with the demands of an ageing population.",

Calls have been made for the European commission to investigate the oil group\u2019s tax affairs after reports claimed that a multibillion-euro bill has been avoided through the use of an offshore trust in Jersey since 2005. The arrangement dates back to the Anglo-Dutch company\u2019s merger of its two branches to establish a single headquarters in The Hague. During discussions over the move, the Dutch tax authorities agreed to exempt its UK-based shareholders from paying a withholding tax on dividend payments if they were routed through Jersey. The Dutch newspaper Trouw has reported claims that the deal is in conflict with European Union rules and that Shell could be liable to treatment similar to that of Apple for arrangements that breached EU state aid rules. Despite an ongoing appeal, the tech giant has in recent months started to pay \u20ac13bn (\u00a311.4bn) in back taxes. Paul Tang, a Dutch MEP in the opposition Labour party, told the paper he would refer the Shell case to Brussels. He said: \u201cThe probability that the European commission will go after this tax arrangement with Shell is huge. With European law in hand, this construction can be reversed.\u201d The leader of the Greens in the Dutch parliament, Jesse Klaver, has also called for an investigation by the Dutch parliament into the arrangement. Marjan van Loon, the president director of Shell Nederland, insisted the Dutch taxpayer had benefited from the company\u2019s move to the Netherlands. She said: \u201cI am astonished about the way we are portrayed in Trouw. This is tendentious. The fact that our headquarters is in the Netherlands \u2026 has been very good for the Dutch treasury.\u201d The Netherlands levies a dividend withholding tax unlike the UK. In order to protect its UK-based shareholders, the company created a structure of A (60%) and B shares (40%) when it relocated. In a statement, the company said: \u201cNo tax is levied on dividends from B shares, provided that they are paid via the so-called dividend access mechanism. \u201cThis solved the problem for the shareholders in the British parent company and made it possible for Shell to unify in one headquarters location, The Hague. \u201cThe dividend access mechanism is fully in line with the tax laws and regulations in the Netherlands. The right to levy dividend withholding tax on dividends paid to shareholders in the former British parent company has never existed in the Netherlands. \u201cThe effect of the dividend access mechanism was simply that this situation continued after the combination of the parent companies. We have always been transparent about the dividend access mechanism in our annual reports.\u201d The Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations has estimated that the oil company has distributed a total of more than \u20ac45bn to shareholders via Jersey, of which \u20ac7bn could have been taken by the Dutch taxman. The Dutch government is seeking to abolish the dividend tax altogether, with the support of Shell and Unilever, which also recently announced its intention to relocate from the UK. Shell claims that some 2,300 Dutch companies have \u201cachieved an annual turnover of between $4bn and $6.5bn through contracts with Shell since its move to The Hague\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The escalating trade war started by Donald Trump could mean fresh financial woes for Britain\u2019s biggest steel plant, less than 18 months after workers agreed to pension benefit cuts to save the Port Talbot works. From 1 June, the US president imposed a 25% tax on steel and a 10% tax on aluminium from the EU, Mexico and Canada. On Friday Trump upped the ante, announcing a 25% tariff on $50bn (\u00a338bn) of Chinese goods. All countries targeted by US tariffs have vowed to take retaliatory measures. The Port Talbot site has 4,200 employees and sells about 10%-12% of its output to the US. Alan Coombs, a Community union shop steward at the site, said the workforce had become even more concerned about the grim prognosis for the future of steelmaking in this country. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to lift your head and look towards the future sometimes. There was a lot of uncertainty anyway, and this just adds more. It puts a doubt in everyone\u2019s mind about the future. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simplistic to say things like \u2018we\u2019ll just add 25% to the price\u2019 because there\u2019s a lot of cheap competition out there. It\u2019s ironic because we started looking into the US market a lot more when the Chinese were dumping their steel here.\u201d The Port Talbot plant has been battered by job cuts and was threatened with closure in the 2016 steel crisis, prompted by weak demand and a glut of cheap Chinese output. Its future was only secured after workers agreed to cuts to their pension benefits in February 2017, part of a package of proposals to help turn the business around. Even with these measures, Port Talbot\u2019s Indian owner, Tata, decided the only long term option was to seek out a joint venture with ThyssenKrupp, a German rival, to pool European assets. That deal is on course to be concluded imminently. However, Britain\u2019s steel sector has barely had time to haul itself off the canvas before being hit with another dizzying blow. The UK exports 350,000 tonnes of steel to the US a year, about 7% of the country\u2019s annual production. Most of this is high value and speciality steel, with an average price of \u20ac1,400 (\u00a31,200) a tonne. The average price for hot-rolled coil steel, one of the benchmark types of steel, is about \u20ac600 a tonne. The US tariffs apply to a wide range of steel and aluminium products such as sheets, plates, bars, pipes and \u201csemi-finished\u201d products. Trump wants to protect US steelmakers by making it more expensive for the county\u2019s manufacturers to buy foreign steel. UK Steel has warned that Trump\u2019s tariffs would leave about 20m tonnes of Chinese steel needing to \u201cfind a new home to go to\u201d. Coombs said: \u201cThe big concern is that it will encourage China to start dumping steel on our doorstep again. The last time we saw stuff like that we went down to one blast furnace. So, it\u2019s a worry, of course.\u201d The Welsh steelworker said it was too soon for the trade charges to have made an impact, but added: \u201cThe fear among the guys is that it\u2019s just around the corner. Everyone in Port Talbot is very aware of how serious this could be.\u201d The GMB union this month said the parliamentary constituency of Aberavon, home to the Port Talbot site, was \u201cmost at risk\u201d from Trump\u2019s tariffs. The union outlined the importance of the industry to Britain, saying it supports more than 34,000 jobs, with annual wages of more than \u00a31bn, and \u00a3230m paid in tax and national insurance contributions. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon, said the Port Talbot works was the \u201cbeating heart of the community\u201d. He added: \u201cThe tariffs are potentially a hammer blow. But the community and the workforce is resilient. \u201cIt\u2019s been met with a big shrug as if to say \u2018people continue to let us down and not stand up for steel\u2019. The people of Port Talbot just put their heads down and keep going. \u201cThe works is in a better position than it was a few years ago, but it is still very fragile and very precarious. Even though the economic outlook is improving, people are just about keeping their heads above water.\u201d As well as the threat of trade barriers and cutthroat competition, British steelmakers must also deal with the burden of higher production costs than many of their competitors around the world and Europe. Steel-making is an energy-intensive process and the UK has some of the highest power bills in Europe. They also face higher labour costs and tougher environmental restrictions than global competitors. The George W Bush administration introduced steel tariffs in 2002, which lasted for 20 months. It prompted threats of retaliation from the European Union on US products before the policy was abandoned. The EU, like China, will challenge the US steel tariffs at the World Trade Organization and the policy is likely to result in tit-for-tat charges on American-made goods flowing into Europe. For Port Talbot, Trump\u2019s tariffs are just another hurdle for long-suffering bosses and workforce to overcome. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating - something like this, which is out of your control,\u201d said Coombs. \u201cYou start to think what else may be around the corner?\u201d",

Government proposals published on Monday are designed to give pension fund trustees more confidence to divest from environmentally damaging fossil fuels and put their cash in green alternatives if it meets their members\u2019 wishes. Until now many pension trustees have been hamstrung by fiduciary duties that they feel requires them to seek the best returns irrespective of the threat of climate change. The new rules, though couched in opaque legalese, are a coded go-ahead for pension funds to sell shares in fossil fuel companies if they believe that they could turn into \u201cstranded assets\u201d. The term refers to companies\u2019 coal, oil and gas deposits that may not ever be monetised as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy. In the paper published on Monday, Clarifying and Strengthening Trustees\u2019 Investment Duties, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u201cOur proposed regulations are intended to reassure trustees that they can (and indeed should) take account of financially material risks, whether these stem from investee firms\u2019 traditional financial reporting, or from broader risks covered in non-financial reporting or elsewhere.\u201d Environmental campaigners reckon that investments amounting to trillions of dollars in fossil fuels \u2013 coal mines, oil wells, power stations, conventional vehicles \u2013 will lose their value when the world moves decisively to a low-carbon economy. They believe that fossil fuel reserves and production facilities will become stranded assets, having absorbed capital but are unable to be used to make a profit. This carbon bubble has been estimated at between $1tn (\u00a3753m) and $4tn, a large chunk of the global economy\u2019s balance sheet. But the DWP warned that the new rules do not give carte blanche for activist groups to bully pension funds into selling out of fossil fuels. \u201cThese proposals are not intended to give any support to activist groups for boycotts or divestment from certain assets,\u201d the DWP paper said. \u201cTrustees have primacy in investment decisions and, whilst they should not necessarily rule out the ability to take account of members\u2019 views, they are never obliged to, and the prime focus is to deliver a return to members.\u201d Unison, the public sector union, launched a campaign in January to encourage local government pension funds \u2013 which have invested \u00a316bn in the fossil fuel industry \u2013 to divest from carbon. The new rules, subject to a consultation period, have been brought forward by secretary of state for work and pensions, Esther McVey. \u201cAs we see the younger generation care more about where their money is going, they are also increasingly questioning that their pensions are invested in a way that aligns with their values,\u201d she said. \u201cThis money can now be used to build a more sustainable, fairer and equal society for future generations.\u201d Climate change campaigners said they were delighted at the proposals. Bethan Livesey, head of policy at ShareAction, said: \u201cShareAction has been pushing for changes to these regulations for years. \u201cFor too long, many pension schemes have disclosed little more than vague, high-level statements on their approach to ESG [Environmental, Social and Governance] factors, and it is unclear what, if anything, is being done behind the scenes. \u201cPension schemes seem to fall into three camps: those who understand the financial value of taking ESG factors seriously and do so, those who say they understand but do very little and those who have no clue. These changes to the regulations should at the very least enlighten the third group.\u201d A growing number of UK and European insurance companies have started selling holdings in coal companies and refusing to insure their operations. More than \u00a315bn has been divested by insurers including Allianz, Aviva, Axa, Legal &amp; General, Swiss Re and Zurich in the past two years, according to Unfriend Coal Network, a global coalition of NGOs and campaigners including 350.org and Greenpeace. Last week Legal &amp; General said it would exclude China Construction Bank, Russia\u2019s Rosneft, the Japanese carmaker Subaru and five other companies that have failed to act on climate change from its Future World Fund. The Rockefeller Family Fund, a charitable fund of the Rockefeller family, which made its fortune from Standard Oil, has started divesting from fossil fuel holdings. However, Cambridge University has just ruled out divesting from oil and gas in its \u00a36.3bn endowment fund \u2013 despite public pressure from hundreds of academics and a hunger strike by three undergraduates. Cambridge said it had no direct investment in fossil fuel companies and wanted to avoid any direct investment in coal and tar sands, while keeping indirect investment to a minimum.",

      "bodyText": "Eurozone finance ministers are braced for a row this week with the Greek government over the terms of a \u201cgolden goodbye\u201d as the country prepares to exit its third bailout programme. Concerns that Greece will suffer a fourth financial collapse unless an agreement is signed with the EU to write off some of its debt mountain are likely to surface before a showdown in Brussels on Thursday. The International Monetary Fund, which has lent Greece several billion euros and has taken part in a tripartite monitoring of reforms with the European commission and European Central Bank (ECB), is expected to pull out of the arrangement unless Brussels reduces Greece\u2019s debt burden. Without the IMF on board, Germany and other hardline countries such as Finland and Austria could demand stricter clauses in the reform programme due to be imposed on Greece as the price of its final bailout payoff. \u201cEveryone has an interest to alleviating the burden, for Greece and the rest of the creditors,\u201d said Olivier Bailly, the chief adviser to the EU\u2019s finance commissioner, Pierre Moscovici. \u201cIf we leave too much burden, this will slow down Greece\u2019s recovery.\u201d He played down the impact of the IMF pulling out of the first stage of surveillance that will last until at least 2022. \u201cWhat is important is that the IMF give its view on debt measures. What the markets expect is that it says they are credible enough,\u201d he said, admitting that the lack of involvement by the Washington-based lender of last resort puts pressure on Germany. Finance ministers from the 19-member currency bloc will meet on Thursday to agree a package of measures that will include a final loan payment of between \u20ac10bn and \u20ac12bn (\u00a38.7bn and \u00a310.5bn) and a cash buffer of up to \u20ac20bn. The payments are due to be the last of the \u20ac86bn bailout agreed in 2015. The Greek parliament last week adopted the 88 so-called \u201cprior actions\u201d that paved the way for a deal with eurozone finance ministers. Athens must continue to cut pensions and implementy a wide range of public-sector reforms to satisfy its exit conditions. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is expected to agree to a tougher surveillance regime than that imposed on Ireland or Portugal, which both exited their bailout programmes early. The Eurogroup will demand it visit Athens every quarter instead of the usual six months. Thereafter, visits from the European commission will continue until Greece has paid back 75% of the \u20ac230bn it owes its eurozone creditors. Tsipras, however, has rebuffed calls by the ECB president, Mario Draghi, and the head of the Greek central bank that he should request a precautionary credit line that would allow the government to access further funds should it encounter unexpected expenses or be locked out of financial markets when it needs to refinance loans. Tsipras said Greece would have a clean break with Brussels, which would be undermined by entering what would be considered by the Eurogroup as another bailout programme, with further strict conditions attached. Hans Vijlbrief, the top EU official advising eurogroup ministers, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very important that Greece can stand on its own feet. If it\u2019s not credible, we won\u2019t come out. This is the first condition.\u201d The Eurogroup is seeking to reduce Greek debt payments by extending loans until beyond 2040 and reducing the interest rate to near 1%, well below the rate Greece would need to pay international investors. The IMF, however, has insisted that reducing the overall debt mountain from the outset is the only way to stabilise Athens\u2019 public finances. Vijlbrief said the EU charter prevented the Eurogroup from offering debt write-offs, but this assertion has never been tested and is still the basis for IMF involvement in the next stage of Greece\u2019s recovery.",

    "webTitle": "UK debit cards transactions overtake cash for the first time", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Debit card payments have overtaken cash as the most popular form of payment in the UK for the first time, according to banking industry figures. Consumers used their debit cards 13.2bn times last year, up 14% compared to 2016, according to a report by UK Finance, the trade body for the UK banking and financial services sector. The number of cash transactions fell by 15% to 13.1bn transactions in the same period. Use of contactless payment cards almost doubled to 5.6bn transactions. Almost two-thirds (63%) of people in the UK now use contactless payments, which were first introduced a decade ago but were not initially popular. About 3.4m people almost never used cash, instead relying on cards. Cash has been overtaken by card payments a year earlier than expected, as more smaller businesses embraced contactless and consumers got used to the speed and ease of \u201cwave and pay\u201d or \u201ctap and go\u201d. The rising popularity of online shopping was cited by the report as another factor for cash losing ground. Gareth Shaw of the consumer group Which? said: \u201cClearly the way we shop and pay for services is changing but for millions of people in the UK cash still plays an essential role in their everyday lives. With bank branch closures on the rise and the UK\u2019s free-to-use ATM network under threat, it\u2019s vital these people are still able to access the cash they need.\u201d The average adult made 54 payments a month last year, 20 by debit card and 20 by cash, including nine contactless payments. By the end of 2017 there were nearly 119m contactless cards in circulation, with 78% of debit cards and 62% of credit cards in Britain having contactless functionality. Yet despite the fall, cash remains the second most frequently used payment method, accounting for just over a third (34%) of all payments. Around 2.2 million customers mainly used cash for their day-to-day shopping last year, even though nine out of 10 of them had a debit card, and the majority used other payment methods to pay their regular bills. Cash use is expected to continue to fall in popularity over the coming decade. UK Finance predicted that cash will account for 6.4bn payments, or 16% of all transactions, in 2027. Contactless payment is forecast to account for 36% of the total, up from 15% in 2017. Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, said: \u201cWe\u2019re far from becoming a cash-free society and despite the UK transforming to an economy where cash is less important than it once was, it will remain a payment method that continues to be valued and preferred by many. \u201cThese trends are likely to shift further over the next decade. Developments such as Open Banking are expected to bring extensive changes to the payments landscape, something that will likely shape how we interact with our money in the coming years.\u201d Initially, \u201ctouch and go\u201d was only offered by coffee shops and sandwich chains and was largely confined to London. The technology received a huge boost four years ago when it became possible for people travelling on the tube and most of London transport using a contactless card, rather than tickets or Oyster smartcards.

The number of cash transactions fell by 15% to 13.1bn transactions in the same period.</p> <p>Use of contactless payment cards almost doubled to 5.6bn transactions. Almost two-thirds (63%) of people in the UK now use contactless payments, which were first introduced a decade ago but were not initially popular. About 3.4m people almost never used cash, instead relying on cards.</p> <p>Cash has been overtaken by card payments a year earlier than expected, as more smaller businesses embraced contactless and consumers got used to the speed and ease of \u201cwave and pay\u201d or \u201ctap and go\u201d. The rising popularity of online shopping was cited by the report as another factor for cash losing ground.</p> <p>Gareth Shaw of the consumer group Which? said:<strong> \u201c</strong>Clearly the way we shop and pay for services is changing but for millions of people in the UK cash still plays an essential role in their everyday lives. With bank branch closures on the rise and the UK\u2019s free-to-use ATM network under threat, it\u2019s vital these people are still able to access the cash they need.\u201d</p> <p>The average adult made 54 payments a month last year, 20 by debit card and 20 by cash, including nine contactless payments.</p> <p>By the end of 2017 there were nearly 119m contactless cards in circulation, with 78% of debit cards and 62% of credit cards in Britain having contactless functionality.</p> <p>Yet despite the fall, cash remains the second most frequently used payment method, accounting for just over a third (34%) of all payments. Around 2.2 million customers mainly used cash for their day-to-day shopping last year, even though nine out of 10 of them had a debit card, and the majority used other payment methods to pay their regular bills. </p> <p>Cash use is expected to continue to fall in popularity over the coming decade. UK Finance predicted that cash will account for 6.4bn payments, or 16% of all transactions, in 2027. Contactless payment is forecast to account for 36% of the total, up from 15% in 2017.</p> <p>Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, said: \u201cWe\u2019re far from becoming a cash-free society and despite the UK transforming to an economy where cash is less important than it once was, it will remain a payment method that continues to be valued and preferred by many.</p> <p>\u201cThese trends are likely to shift further over the next decade. Developments such as Open Banking are expected to bring extensive changes to the payments landscape, something that will likely shape how we interact with our money in the coming years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Initially, \u201ctouch and go\u201d was only offered by coffee shops and sandwich chains and was largely confined to London.

      "bodyText": "Deliveroo is facing a parliamentary inquiry into the pay and conditions of its couriers in the latest challenge to the gig economy. Frank Field MP, chairman of the work and pensions committee, which has already taken evidence from workers at Hermes, Uber, DPD and Parcelforce, will now gather evidence from Deliveroo riders over the next five weeks. The inquiry will include a round table at which the takeaway delivery service\u2019s workers will give oral evidence. Field will also be writing to Deliveroo to gather evidence about pay and conditions for its cyclists and moped riders. \u201cThe weight of the evidence I\u2019ve seen shows that bogus self-employment is being peddled by those who benefit so handsomely from the gig economy, to avoid the obligations they have to their workforce,\u201d Field said. \u201cI now wish to see if this is a partial view or whether it, sadly, represents what is going on in yet another company operating in the gig economy.\u201d Field\u2019s move comes as Deliveroo faces at least two legal cases over the employment rights of its riders. On Friday, the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents many gig economy workers, won the right to seek a judicial review of a ruling that found Deliveroo riders were not entitled to union representation. In November the Central Arbitration Committee, which considers union recognition and collective bargaining cases, rejected an application by the IWGB to represent drivers in parts of north London. It said thefirm\u2019s riders were self-employed contractors because they had the right to allocate a substitute to do the work for them. The union had argued they were \u201cworkers\u201d who enjoy limited rights including holiday pay and the right to collective bargaining. The high court agreed that Deliveroo riders were self-employed contractors but said it was arguable the CAC should have considered the right of the couriers, and other workers in a similar position, to bargain collectively \u2013 as enshrined in article 11 of the European convention on human rights. The union, which has raised \u00a323,000 so far in crowdfunding for the legal costs of the case, is expected to launch the judicial review by the end of this year. Next month the law firm Leigh Day will be leading an employment tribunal action demanding better employment rights including the minimum wage, sick pay and paid holiday for Deliveroo riders. The tribunal case involves at least 20 delivery riders who say they are employees and not, as the company argues, self-employed contractors. The Leigh Day case can be brought as it will examine the historic contracts of Deliveroo riders rather than the latest contracts, which were updated by the company during the process of the CAC case. It comes after the employment rights of workers in the gig economy were boosted after a heating engineer won his claim against Pimlico Plumbers at the supreme court last week, establishing that he was a worker and not self-employed. The supreme court\u2019s unanimous judgment is likely to set a significant precedent for a series of similar legal battles, including those involving the cab firms Uber and Addison Lee, which are in dispute with their drivers over employment status. Pimlico Plumbers, which lost at every stage of the dispute, had appealed to the UK\u2019s highest court, arguing that those it sent out to repair leaking pipes and malfunctioning dishwashers were self-employed and not \u201cworkers\u201d. Workers do not enjoy the full range of employment protection rights given to full-time staff but are entitled to many elements such as holiday pay.",

Customers can arrange through an app to have any unwanted clothing that they bought from John Lewis collected from their home, and they will be paid for each item regardless of its condition. The pilot scheme has been developed with Stuffstr, a social enterprise. \u201cWe already take back used sofas, beds and large electrical items such as washing machines and either donate them to charity or reuse and recycle parts and want to offer a service for fashion products,\u201d said Martyn White, the retailer\u2019s sustainability manager. He said the average UK household owned about \u00a34,000 worth of clothes, almost a third of which had not been worn for at least a year, mostly because items no longer fitted. Customers using the app can choose what they want to sell and are shown the amount they can receive for them. Once a customer has at least \u00a350 worth of clothing to sell, a courier will collect the products. The customer is then emailed a John Lewis e-gift card for the value of the items sold. Items bought back are either resold \u2013 though not in John Lewis stores \u2013 mended for resale or recycled into new products. Last year John Lewis took back for \u201cupcycling\u201d more than 27,000 electrical products and about 2,000 used sofas, and recycled materials from 55,000 mattresses. John Atcheson, the chief executive of Stuffstr, said: \u201cEvery item has value, even old socks, and we want to make it as simple as possible for customers to benefit from their unwanted clothes.\u201d The pilot is the first clothing recycling scheme on the high street to use technology in a way that provides its users a financial incentive. Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s \u201cschwopping\u201d scheme, launched in 2012, has prevented more than 7.7m items of clothing from being thrown away, while brands including H&amp;M and Zara have stepped up in-store recycling initiatives. A report on the scale of waste generated by the fashion industry, published last November by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, put the annual cost to the UK economy of landfilling clothing and household textiles at about \u00a382m. Francois Souchet, of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, said: \u201cEvery second the equivalent of one truck full of clothes is sent to landfill or incineration.
