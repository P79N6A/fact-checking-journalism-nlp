      "bodyText": "Low-cost airlines' signature scramble for seats may soon be a thing of the past after easyJet announced it is to test allocated seating for passengers. But as the airline told the City that it had reduced its losses thanks to higher baggage charges, it said the plan to allow 40,000 passengers to pre-book their seats from today on a range of routes this summer was not motivated by squeezing more money out of customers but by a desire to reduce their stress. When the first easyJet plane took to the skies in 1995, the dash for the prime positions was as much a feature of low-cost flying as a garish onboard colour scheme and an often obscure destination airport. Now, as the boundaries between traditional airlines and low-cost carriers has become increasingly blurred, passengers can pay to choose their own seat or be allocated one free of charge. While the service will cost \u00a312 for premium places in the front or exit rows, or \u00a33 for any other chosen seat, the chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said the plan was not a money-spinner but \"revenue-neutral\". \"We've done a lot of research and found unreserved seating can stress people out a little bit, if they're not used to boarding that way,\" she said. \"Our surveys showed that it can be a barrier to people travelling with us.\" Unreserved seating was a founding feature of the low-cost airline revolution primarily because it was seen to be a faster, more efficient way to board aircraft. A fast turnaround at airports has been a key element of the low-cost business model. McCall said that if the trials showed allocated seating slowed operation of the planes it would not be used further. The airline claims it has developed \"one of the most sophisticated algorithms in world aviation\" to ensure families and groups can still sit together despite passengers choosing their own seats. While McCall insisted that the \u00a35m technological investment was \"not about making people pay extra for their seat\", business analysts said that the reported strong growth in revenues were partly down to a controversial administration fee introduced for all bookings in January. EasyJet has said its half-year losses would be smaller than expected after its revenues were boosted by higher baggage charges. The Luton-based group \u2013 which operates more than 580 routes across 30 countries \u2013 said revenue growth per seat in the six months to 31 March would be better than expected at 10%, with about half that rise due to higher fees and charges. But Douglas McNeill, of Charles Stanley Securities, put easyJet's improved results down to \"benign weather [so fewer cancelled flights], the withdrawal of competitor capacity [Ryanair decided to ground much of its fleet this winter] and the January introduction of a universal administration fee in place of debit card booking fees.\" A successful TV advertisement featuring music from Liverpudlian rockers the Wombats also helped easyJet. EasyJet now expects to report a pre-tax loss for the six months to 31 March of \u00a3110m to \u00a3120m, compared with previous forecasts of \u00a3140m to \u00a3160m, and a \u00a3153m loss last year. The group, like many airlines, always reports a loss in the first half of its financial year. Shares in easyJet closed up 7.5% after Monday's update.It previously reported higher revenues for first three months of its financial year as it raised its first bag charge by 16.9% to \u00a34.70 per seat. Total fees and charges increased by 26.7% to \u00a35.88 a seat. Meanwhile, easyJet said disruption and de-icing costs were \u00a318m lower than the same period last year, when the UK was hit by a prolonged period of severe weather. The carrier, which has a 200-strong fleet of aircraft, said total cost per seat for the whole year was expected to increase by 2%, assuming no significant disruption arising from events such as airspace congestion during the Olympics. It said it had also benefited from the demise of rivals, with the likes of the Spanish carrier Spanair and Hungary's Malev going bust in January. Looking ahead, easyJet said about 30% of seats for the second half of the financial year were booked. The group's expectations for financial performance in the latter half of the year are unchanged, as it expects a higher fuel bill. McCall, said: \"We continue to expect the environment for airlines to remain difficult.\" The airline's board last month won a battle with its founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, after shareholders overwhelmingly backed its multimillion-pound pay plans. Stelios, who speaks for 37.4% of the company's shares, failed to convince enough investors to join him in voting against the company's remuneration report, as well as the re-election of four directors including the chairman, Sir Michael Rake. He is currently working on a new airline venture in west Africa, to be called FastJet. Yesterday saw the inaugural easyJet flight from the newly re-opened Southend airport to Barcelona. The airline also announced new winter routes from the Essex town to Geneva, a major point of entry for Alpine skiing holidays. Alastair Welch, managing director of Stobart Air, said it was \"the cusp of a new dawn for Southend\".",

Some of that can be seen in figures from the estate agents Savills, which says the value of rented homes in Britain has soared by 42% to \u00a3840bn. Everyone wants to rent properties for a living. It's easier than working and seems to bring in a guaranteed income. The mania for buying and selling homes for magical profits was supposed to be a thing of the past. If the crash taught us anything, it was that flippin' flats after a quick makeover for big bucks was the nation's downfall. But here we are, supping from the property gravy train again. Savills reckons 4.8m rented homes generated a total income last year of \u00a348bn. By 2016, such is the dearth of house and flat building, the rent extracted by landlords will have soared to \u00a370bn. With housebuilding at its lowest since the 1920s, the number of homes coming on the market cannot keep up with a growing population, a mini-baby boom, the changing needs of an ageing population and the ongoing complications of family break-ups. Everyone seems to want to reinvent the recent past and a spiv culture that meant there was a killing to be made buying and selling ordinary homes. What we need is more executive homes in tidy little cul-de-sacs that look like Brookside Close houses with the addition of a garage or two. These can be tacked on the sides of existing towns, preferably in the home counties, within shouting distance of London, where people need to work but cannot afford to live. The same scenario can be found dominating the thinking of property firms around cities such as Birmingham, Manchester and Newcastle, where there is pressure to relax rules on greenfield building to satisfy demand. The government's NewBuy scheme, which subsidises the mortgages on new homes, coupled with a relaxation of planning laws, is supposed to hurry along these developments. However, NewBuy only encourages hard-pressed families to bid up the cost of the few newly built homes already on the market, to the benefit of housebuilders (which contribute millions to Tory party coffers). Local councils are in effect out of the housebuilding equation, while social landlords are seeing their budgets cut. With the public and semi-public sectors shackled, the private lobby calls the shots. This leaves the government with two problems: how to get the money to build and renovate more homes, and where to build new homes. Money could come from private sources such as pension funds. My problem with the private sector, pension funds included, is that it just wants to join the game of driving prices and rents higher. The new homes that developers have in mind are only in \"safe\" areas that will command extraordinarily high rents to compensate for paying the huge purchase cost of land with planning permission and the extortionate sums demanded by investors. Surely there is a case for resisting the temptation to simply kickstart the same old property game? The government needs to examine ditching property transaction taxes altogether in favour of taxing land on an annual basis. A land tax is the only way to bring the industry to heel and end the spiv culture that brings a boom and bust every generation. It is much the same solution for banks. They need to be made boring and people-friendly. At the moment, the only winners are landowners and landlords.",

      "bodyText": "The video-game specialist Game said it was shutting almost half its UK stores with the loss of more than 2,000 high-street jobs after administrators took control of the stricken chain. The retailer had warned last week that administration was on the cards after it failed to agree a rescue deal with its lenders, led by the state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland, who are owed \u00a360m. This morning PwC was officially appointed as the administrator and its restructuring experts acted quickly, telling staff that 277 of its 610 UK stores would close by the end of this week, resulting in 2,104 redundancies. PwC's Mike Jervis said: \"The recent job losses are regrettable but will place the company in a stronger position while we explore opportunities to conclude a sale. Our priority is to continue trading the business as normal while we continue to pursue a sale.\" Jervis said he was hopeful of finding a buyer for the Basingstoke-based company, with a number of parties interested in buying all or part of the group, which has a total of 1,300 stores including its operations in international markets such as Spain, France and Australia. Before its collapse, Game had about 5,500 staff in UK stores and its head office. Game owes money to a group of banks that includes RBS, Barclays, HSBC and La Caixa and a \"lender-led\" rescue is one of the options being discussed. Banking insiders said a sale of the business was preferable but that a debt-for-equity swap was one of the scenarios being discussed. Its US rival Gamestop is also thought to be interested in some of Game's international stores, while the turnaround specialists OpCapita, which tabled an earlier bid, and Hilco are also looking at the business. PwC said the 333 stores not being closed, which employ 2,814 people, would continue to trade as normal. The Game website has been suspended, as has the Game reward and gift card scheme, and staff can no longer give refunds. The changes have resulted in angry exchanges in some stores, with upset customers and staff taking to Twitter and industry blogs as news of store closures leaked into the public domain. One employee told the trade website MCV: \"I have had a mixture of supportive people \u2026 and just idiots who think shouting at me and my staff who have narrowly avoided being jobless for at least the short term will solve their problem.\" The crisis at Game was set in train earlier this year when worried lenders reduced the retailer's borrowing facilities. That meant the management team, led by the chief executive, Ian Shepherd, had to ask suppliers for help. However, major industry players such as Electronic Arts and Nintendo refused to support the chain, leaving the retailer with no stock of new titles such as Mass Effect 3 and Mario Party 9. Last week Game's shares were suspended from the London Stock Exchange, its investors having previously been warned that their investment was worthless. The retailer's failure is expected to leave landlords and suppliers out of pocket. Its \u00a321m quarterly rent bill fell due at the weekend, while suppliers are owed \u00a340m. PwC is expected to honour the \u00a312m wage bill that is due later this week. In a statement, Game said PwC was called in after discussions with its lenders and third parties reached a dead-end: \"This decision is taken after careful consideration and ceaseless interrogation of every possible alternative.\" Shepherd has also stepped down, explaining to staff that with the administrator now in place, having two people trying to run the business was \"confusing and a waste of money\". The high street continues to be hit hard by the slowdown in spending triggered by the credit crunch. Higher food and fuel prices mean Britons have been forced to cut spending on non-essentials with the resulting decline in sales putting severe pressure on retailers, particularly chains such as Game which have large store networks around the country. Game joins a growing list of retail casualties, following hot on the heels of last month's breakup of the value fashion group Peacocks, which resulted in more than 3,000 job losses. One in seven shops now lies empty, according to the latest figures from the Local Data Company. Just as HMV, the last national music and DVD chain on the high street, has been hit by rising internet sales, downloads and competition from supermarkets, Game also suffered as gamers cut out the middle man. The industry trade body UKIE estimates that nearly \u00a3680m was spent on game downloads last year. \"Game has faced serious cashflow and profit issues over the recent past,\" said Jervis. High fixed costs and an ambitious international rollout had added to the firm's problems. But he was optimistic that there was still a place for Game on the high street: \"We believe there is room for a specialist game retailer in the territories in which it operates, including its biggest one, the UK. As a result, we are hopeful that a going-concern sale of the business is achievable.\"",

For example, Peter Voser, the boss of Shell, got just over \u00a310m while Marjorie Scardino, the chief executive of Pearson, received \u00a39.6m. Two more names now enter the frame. David Brennan, chief executive of AstraZeneca, got more than \u00a39m in 2011. The annual report of the pharmaceutical company shows that his \u00a3997,000 salary was bolstered by an array of annual bonuses and benefits to take his 2011 total as reported by the company to \u00a33.37m, to which \u00a35.6m of share awards from 2008 which were released to him last year can also be added. The former chief executive of British American Tobacco, Paul Adams, who retired last February, took home \u00a39.7m in 2011 as a string of long-term incentive plans, one of which dates back to 2008, were released to him worth \u00a38.7m. The tobacco company's annual report also shows that he retired with a \u00a316.7m pension pot \u2013 paying out \u00a3603,382 a year \u2013 after a lengthy career with a group that produces 5.5tn cigarettes a year. Even so, these boardroom executives will not top the pay leagues for FTSE 100 bosses for 2011. Bob Diamond, the Barclays boss, for instance, received \u00a317m in 2011 before the bank paid his \u00a35.7m tax bill. But there are also those FTSE 100 bosses who can only look at \u00a310m with envy. Steve Foots, the new chief executive of Croda, received \u00a3638,000 for 2011 - topped by another \u00a3458,000 from long-term awards. That was before Foots was handed a 66% rise in salary to \u00a3500,000 at the start of 2012 for being promoted to chief executive after 20 years with the chemicals company which only burst in to FTSE 100 index earlier this month. The company admits that Foots, in his first job as a chief executive, is likely to be handed a number of pay rises over the \"next few years\" as he has started at the \"lower quartile of relevant benchmarks\". Perhaps in a year or two he'll make it into the \u00a39m club.",

Tullow's exploration director Angus McCoss said:</p> <blockquote> This is an excellent start to our major exploration campaign in the East African rift basins of Kenya and Ethiopia. to make such a good oil discovery in our first well is beyond our expectations and bodes well for the material programme ahead of us. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>BG</strong> added 27p to \u00a315.19 and <strong>Ophir Energy</strong> climbed 75.6p to 477.6p following news of a gas discovery in Tanzania, where the two have a joint venture. BG said its fourth success in the country came from the Jodari-1 well, which could have up to 4.4trn cubic feet of oil. BG holds 60% of the Tanzanian venture and is the main operator, while Ophir holds the rest.</p> <p>Ophir chief executive Nick Cooper said the find was the largest discovery in the company's history, and materially exceeded pre-drill estimates:</p> <p>On Ophir analyst Stuart Joyner of Investec said:</p> <blockquote> We substantially increase our valuation of the Tanzania gas play, based on the analogous data to Mozambique's outboard basin fan play across blocks, and increase our target to 480p a share [from 277p]. </blockquote> <p>Meawhile <strong>International Power</strong>, where majority shareholder GDF Suez has been tipped to buy out the rest of the business it does not own, rose 9.6p to 382.4p after tidying up its assets in Pakistan. It sold its 17% stake in the Hub Power Company for \u20ac51m and at the same time buying another 20% of power station UCH 1 to take its shareholding to 94.6%.</p> <p>Overall the market rallied, boosted by hopes that Germany would agree to an increase in the European bail out fund this week and more specifically, by comments from US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke that suggested low interest rates were here for the foreseeable future and also hinted at the prospect of further quantitative easing. So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 47.81 points higher at 5902.70, with Wall Street up around 120 points by the time the London market closed.</p> <p><strong>Aberdeen Asset Management</strong> added 10.9p to 260.8p after a trading update showed an inflow of \u00a31.4bn in the first two months of the year. Stuart Duncan at Peel Hunt said:</p> <blockquote> On current forecasts, Aberdeen is trading on an annualised December 2012 of 10.3 times, which compares to the sector average of 9.3 times. With Aberdeen's balance sheet continuing to strengthen from organic cash generation, the yield of 4.2% looks well supported, with upside risk to our dividend forecasts if the business continues to deliver as expected. <br> We had downgraded to hold believing most of the good news in the short term was largely reflected in the share price but, with the shares having drifted back, there is now upside of 12% to our unchanged target price of 280p and we upgrade to buy. </blockquote> <p>Gold miners were lifted by a rise in the bullion price, up around $25 an ounce to $16.85. <strong>Randgold Resources</strong>, under pressure last week on worries about its projects in Mali after a coup in the country, recovered 130p to \u00a357.80.</p> <p><strong>African Barrick Gold</strong> climbed 29.5p to 424p.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Cable &amp; Wireless Communications</strong> climbed 0.8p to 32.97p on revived takeover talk.</p> <p><strong>Easyjet</strong> soared 34.4p to 495.8p after it said it expected its first half loss to be less than expected.</p> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Bowleven</strong>, the exploration group focused on West Africa, rose 17.25p to 105.5p. The company - where Dragon Oil recently made a bid approach before dropping its interest - reported reduced half year losses of $5.5m, down from $15.7m.</p> <p><strong>Premier Foods</strong>, which last week said it would have to sell further businesses - \u00a3330m worth - under the terms of a refinancing package, added 2p to 15.25p as UBS raised its price target from 2p to 10p. The company is struggling with a near \u00a31bn debt mountain and saw profits fall 29%, and UBS analyst Alan Erskine kept his sell rating, saying:</p> <blockquote> Back in November, we thought it likely existing shareholders would see their ownership significantly diluted in any refinancing. In the event the new management team has been able to at least secure a two year breathing space in <br>which (1) their effective cost of debt will ratchet down, from just over 6% to just over 3%; (2) they will not have to make any deficit contributions to the pension fund (having been running at close to \u00a350m per annum); (3) they are not required <br>to repay any debt (other than disposal proceeds); and (4) their covenants are not particularly challenging. <br> <br>However, in some respects (helped perhaps by an element of mutually assured destruction) they have done the easy part. The hard part, in our view, will be simultaneously re-energising/shrinking Premier's portfolio (in a challenging environment) in a way that addresses the still very significant debt burden and pension liability. <br> <br>In our view the current valuation represents too big a leap of faith. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Moody's downgraded the company's credit rating from B2 to B3 with a negative outlook.</p>",

Ophir chief executive Nick Cooper said the find was the largest discovery in the company's history, and materially exceeded pre-drill estimates: On Ophir analyst Stuart Joyner of Investec said: We substantially increase our valuation of the Tanzania gas play, based on the analogous data to Mozambique's outboard basin fan play across blocks, and increase our target to 480p a share [from 277p]. Meawhile International Power, where majority shareholder GDF Suez has been tipped to buy out the rest of the business it does not own, rose 9.6p to 382.4p after tidying up its assets in Pakistan. It sold its 17% stake in the Hub Power Company for \u20ac51m and at the same time buying another 20% of power station UCH 1 to take its shareholding to 94.6%. Overall the market rallied, boosted by hopes that Germany would agree to an increase in the European bail out fund this week and more specifically, by comments from US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke that suggested low interest rates were here for the foreseeable future and also hinted at the prospect of further quantitative easing. So the FTSE 100 finished 47.81 points higher at 5902.70, with Wall Street up around 120 points by the time the London market closed. Aberdeen Asset Management added 10.9p to 260.8p after a trading update showed an inflow of \u00a31.4bn in the first two months of the year. Stuart Duncan at Peel Hunt said: On current forecasts, Aberdeen is trading on an annualised December 2012 of 10.3 times, which compares to the sector average of 9.3 times. With Aberdeen's balance sheet continuing to strengthen from organic cash generation, the yield of 4.2% looks well supported, with upside risk to our dividend forecasts if the business continues to deliver as expected. We had downgraded to hold believing most of the good news in the short term was largely reflected in the share price but, with the shares having drifted back, there is now upside of 12% to our unchanged target price of 280p and we upgrade to buy. Gold miners were lifted by a rise in the bullion price, up around $25 an ounce to $16.85. Randgold Resources, under pressure last week on worries about its projects in Mali after a coup in the country, recovered 130p to \u00a357.80. African Barrick Gold climbed 29.5p to 424p. Elsewhere Cable &amp; Wireless Communications climbed 0.8p to 32.97p on revived takeover talk. Easyjet soared 34.4p to 495.8p after it said it expected its first half loss to be less than expected. Lower down the market Bowleven, the exploration group focused on West Africa, rose 17.25p to 105.5p. The company - where Dragon Oil recently made a bid approach before dropping its interest - reported reduced half year losses of $5.5m, down from $15.7m. Premier Foods, which last week said it would have to sell further businesses - \u00a3330m worth - under the terms of a refinancing package, added 2p to 15.25p as UBS raised its price target from 2p to 10p. The company is struggling with a near \u00a31bn debt mountain and saw profits fall 29%, and UBS analyst Alan Erskine kept his sell rating, saying: Back in November, we thought it likely existing shareholders would see their ownership significantly diluted in any refinancing. In the event the new management team has been able to at least secure a two year breathing space in which (1) their effective cost of debt will ratchet down, from just over 6% to just over 3%; (2) they will not have to make any deficit contributions to the pension fund (having been running at close to \u00a350m per annum); (3) they are not required to repay any debt (other than disposal proceeds); and (4) their covenants are not particularly challenging. However, in some respects (helped perhaps by an element of mutually assured destruction) they have done the easy part. The hard part, in our view, will be simultaneously re-energising/shrinking Premier's portfolio (in a challenging environment) in a way that addresses the still very significant debt burden and pension liability. In our view the current valuation represents too big a leap of faith. Meanwhile Moody's downgraded the company's credit rating from B2 to B3 with a negative outlook.",

Concerned consumers should also read our Q&amp;A on gift vouchers and may find the following helpful: Are all gift vouchers worthless if a company goes into administration? It depends on the administrators that take over the company. Vouchers tend not to be accepted and those in possession of a voucher would need to lodge a claim with the administrators and hope for the best. I bought vouchers using a credit card. Am I protected? Buying with a credit card does usually offer you extra protection when a company goes bust, assuming you have spent more than \u00a3100. The part of the Consumer Credit Act (1974) known as section 75 means your credit card company is \"jointly and severally liable\" for any breach of contract or misrepresentation by the company you have bought through \u2013 so the card company would pay out on your claim. However, the situation with vouchers is more complicated, and the Financial Ombudsman Service says vouchers have not yet formed the basis of a claim on which it has had to rule. The situation does appear to be that if there is no third party involved then you could be effective in making a claim. So, if you buy vouchers directly from a store to spend in that store you would be entitled to your money back if that store went bust (remember, this only applies if you've spent more than \u00a3100 using your credit card). However, if you used a third party such as a website that sells vouchers on behalf of a number of stores, you could not make a claim. Check out our factsheet on using Section 75 and the Chargeback facility for more information. My vouchers don't have an expiry date. Can I use them whenever I like? Don't assume that because you can't see an expiry date on a voucher or gift card that it doesn't have one. Some, such as those from John Lewis, have no expiry date. But others do: gift cards for Amazon.co.uk, for example, expire one year from the date of issue, while Marks &amp; Spencer gift cards are valid for four years, although each time a customer spends on the card the expiry date is reset to four years.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Mobile network 3 buys time to take legal action over 4G", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The mobile network 3 will warn on Tuesday that it is upgrading its network, in a move that will enable it to take legal action against the telecoms regulator and derail the already long-delayed 4G spectrum auction. A court case against Ofcom could damage the credibility of its chief executive, Ed Richards, who has already presided over a number of hold-ups that mean the UK will be the last major European economy to auction the airspace needed for 4G superfast mobile broadband. The sell-off, which could raise as much as \u00a34bn for the cash-strapped Treasury, is scheduled for early 2013. With 4G already up and running in the US and Germany, further delays would also embarrass the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt. 3, the newest and smallest mobile network in the UK with a 10% market share, wants to persuade Ofcom to redraft the 4G auction rules, because it feels they do not do enough to ensure its survival. It had been thought that 3 needed the spectrum auction to happen quickly because its network was running out of capacity. But its UK chief executive, David Dyson, will tell a conference in London on Tuesday that this is no longer the case. He will announce he has bought enough time to go to court, through new plans to double the capacity of his network with a technology upgrade. Work has already begun along the M3 corridor from Twickenham, London, to Camberley, in Surrey, and will roll out nationally. 3 has been luring smartphone customers with unlimited data offers, and claims to carry 40% of the UK's mobile internet traffic. The company warned last year that in certain urban areas it would run out of capacity by the end of 2012. It has decided to beef up its network by moving to a technology called High Speed Packet Access 42.2, which can carry twice the traffic of its HSPA 21.1 network. A spokesman confirmed 3 would be updating its public position on the spectrum this week, saying: \"You can expect it to address competition and the principles set out by Ofcom in a four-player market for the benefit of consumers.\" The 4G auction rules will be finalised this July, and the deadline for consultation responses was last week. The three largest players, Vodafone, Everything Everywhere and O2, will compete on a level playing field for spectrum, but the rules as drafted ensure one lot of spectrum \u2013 not necessarily from the 800MHz band \u2013 will be reserved for a fourth operator. Ofcom will be handing out licences for two types of spectrum, 800MHz and 2600MHz, in what it is billing as the largest ever auction of British airspace. The 800MHz, which travels further and is better at penetrating inside buildings, is considered the most valuable. 3, which was loss-making until last year but has a rich backer in the Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka Shing, believes it will be outbid on 800MHz, and would like the watchdog to reserve some of it specifically for a fourth player. Without the lower frequency spectrum, 3 argues, its business will not be viable. While more bandwidth is available in this auction than in any previous sale, mobile operators are no longer fast-growing businesses and the amount raised is likely to pale in comparison to the \u00a322.5bn pocketed by the Treasury in the 3G auction in 2000.

      "body": "<p>The mobile network 3 will warn on Tuesday that it is upgrading its network, in a move that will enable it to take legal action against the telecoms regulator and derail the already long-delayed 4G spectrum auction.</p> <p>A court case against Ofcom could damage the credibility of its chief executive, Ed Richards, who has already presided over a number of hold-ups that mean the UK will be the last major European economy to auction the airspace needed for 4G superfast mobile broadband.</p> <p>The sell-off, which could raise as much as \u00a34bn for the cash-strapped Treasury, is scheduled for early 2013. With 4G already up and running in the US and Germany, further delays would also embarrass the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt.</p> <p>3, the newest and smallest mobile network in the UK with a 10% market share, wants to persuade Ofcom to redraft the 4G auction rules, because it feels they do not do enough to ensure its survival.</p> <p>It had been thought that 3 needed the spectrum auction to happen quickly because its network was running out of capacity.</p> <p>But its UK chief executive, David Dyson, will tell a conference in London on Tuesday that this is no longer the case.</p> <p>He will announce he has bought enough time to go to court, through new plans to double the capacity of his network with a technology upgrade. Work has already begun along the M3 corridor from Twickenham, London, to Camberley, in Surrey, and will roll out nationally.</p> <p>3 has been luring smartphone customers with unlimited data offers, and claims to carry 40% of the UK's mobile internet traffic. The company warned last year that in certain urban areas it would run out of capacity by the end of 2012. It has decided to beef up its network by moving to a technology called High Speed Packet Access 42.2, which can carry twice the traffic of its HSPA 21.1 network.</p> <p>A spokesman confirmed 3 would be updating its public position on the spectrum this week, saying: \"You can expect it to address competition and the principles set out by Ofcom in a four-player market for the benefit of consumers.\"</p> <p>The 4G auction rules will be finalised this July, and the deadline for consultation responses was last week. The three largest players, Vodafone, Everything Everywhere and O2, will compete on a level playing field for spectrum, but the rules as drafted ensure one lot of spectrum \u2013 not necessarily from the 800MHz band \u2013 will be reserved for a fourth operator.</p> <p>Ofcom will be handing out licences for two types of spectrum, 800MHz and 2600MHz, in what it is billing as the largest ever auction of British airspace. The 800MHz, which travels further and is better at penetrating inside buildings, is considered the most valuable.</p> <p>3, which was loss-making until last year but has a rich backer in the Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka Shing, believes it will be outbid on 800MHz, and would like the watchdog to reserve some of it specifically for a fourth player. Without the lower frequency spectrum, 3 argues, its business will not be viable.</p> <p>While more bandwidth is available in this auction than in any previous sale, mobile operators are no longer fast-growing businesses and the amount raised is likely to pale in comparison to the \u00a322.5bn pocketed by the Treasury in the 3G auction in 2000.</p> <p>Vodafone said last week it was against special treatment for 3. A spokesman said: \"We still do not believe \u2026 the case has been made for reserving any spectrum \u2026 for 3. Ofcom should stop trying to over-engineer the release of new spectrum to run the next generation of mobile internet services, and simply run a fair and open auction as soon as possible.
