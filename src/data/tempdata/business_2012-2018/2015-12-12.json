      "bodyText": "David Blanchflower (below), former Bank of England policymaker, economics professor at Dartmouth College The FOMC looks set to raise rates this week. That will likely be a major macro error at a time when oil and commodity prices are tumbling and there is no inflation. Most of the growth in the US economy is driven by the monetary stimulus; tightening now will rapidly have adverse effects, including on the manufacturing sector from the strengthening dollar. The US labour market is a long way from full employment even though the unemployment rate is 5%. The proportion of adults who are out of the labour force is down four percentage points from its pre-recession peak and the high levels of underemployment have diminished only slowly. Unemployment, underemployment and inactivity are all pushing down on wage growth, which remains flat. If they do hike this week, I expect the move after that to be a cut \u2013 perhaps even to negative, as the ECB had to do after they raised too soon in 2011. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Commercial Banking Not only do I think the Fed are going to hike, I think they should hike \u2013 but I also think they should have hiked some time ago. There is a byproduct of quantitative easing and maintaining these very low rates for a considerable period. People have got into thinking that rates will stay low for a long period. Very low interest rates were helpful in the early stages of the crisis, but as things have progressed they have encouraged people, particularly at the lower end of the income scale, to take on more debt, to the extent that when rates do rise they will be in a less healthy position. And as for spending, are very low interest rates making people go out and spend? No. They are, if anything, making people have to save a bit harder. Now the economy looks in pretty decent shape, with a few pockets of weakness, moving out of this emergency policy position makes sense. And on aggregate, this could free up some spending, and actually send a note of encouragement, as it says loud and clear: \u201cThe crisis is over, go and spend.\u201d Philip Shaw, economist at Investec The US economy is now around 10% bigger than it was at its pre-crisis peak, so the question is: why have interest rates stayed close to zero? The labour market is tightening, there is some evidence that wage pressures are rising and it feels like the right thing to start tightening policy. Of course, there are always risks. Moving in September would have been wrong given a very uncertain backdrop in terms of financial market volatility. But not moving also carries risks because of beginning to condition firms and households to interest rates being on hold forever. The new focus in the US monetary policy debate should shift away from \u201clift-off\u201d towards the pace of tightening. I think the key policy question is what the Fed means by \u201cgradual\u201d. It hides a multitude of things. Aneta Markowska, US economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale I fully agree that the Fed should raise rates next week. Indeed, I think they should have hiked six months ago: the prolonged anticipation contributed to market volatility which could have been avoided. But why hike now when inflation is still so low? The first reason is optionality, which should promote greater financial stability. Waiting to hike until the last moment will leave the Fed with only one path, and it is likely to be steep and disruptive. By going earlier, it can move gradually. Another reason for hiking sooner rather than later is to test the waters. The US economy has gone through big structural changes, from financial regulation and population aging, to so-called \u201cUberisation\u201d. As a result, I suspect that we will be less interest-rate-sensitive compared to past cycles. The first few hikes may even prove stimulative as they boost income from savings, net interest margins and confidence. As the saying goes, you never know until you try. Kathy Bostjancic, Head of US macro investor services at Oxford Economics The Fed should raise the target for the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points to a \u00bc-\u00bd per cent range. However, we believe the Fed should engineer just two rate hikes in 2016. Dollar appreciation limits the prospective tightening since the strong dollar has done some of the tightening for the Fed. We calculate that the dollar appreciation to date has the equivalent impact on economic growth as about four Fed rate hikes.",

      "bodyText": "Bankers call them \u201celephant deals\u201d \u2013 blockbusting takeover bids that slam together vast global businesses. And when the corporate history books are written, 2015 will be remembered as the year of the elephant. A cluster of massive deals have made 2015 a record-breaking year for mergers and acquisitions globally, with the total value of deals breaking the record set in 2007, before the financial crash. According to data from Dealogic, there have been nine deals worth more than $50bn (\u00a333bn) in 2015, five more than in 2014. The big bids were led by US pharma group Pfizer\u2019s recently announced $160bn deal with botox-maker Allergan. The next two top deals were UK-based \u2013 brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s $117bn bid for rival SABMiller, which was launched in London, and Shell\u2019s $81bn acquisition of BG. On Friday came another: US chemicals groups Dow and DuPont, both founded in the 19th century, agreed a merger to create a $130bn business. David Lomer, joint head of mergers and acquisitions at JP Morgan, says: \u201cThe record year has been driven by the US and Asia. It\u2019s been a smart time to buy companies.\u201d Europe has been quieter, with company bosses and shareholders wary of making bold moves in volatile markets within an economic region that has not resolved its problems. \u201cAlthough Europe is in a far better place than it was a couple of years ago, corporates will think twice about doubling up in this geography,\u201d says Luigi Rizzo, head of M&amp;A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. But he thinks big deals will happen on the continent soon: \u201cI\u2019m quite bullish about Europe \u2026 I think [it] is maybe one or two years behind the US M&amp;A cycle.\u201d In the US, there have been giant bids in healthcare, hospitality, cable, engineering and food. Famed billionaire investor Warren Buffett has also been part of the trend, with a $32bn bid for industrial components group Precision Castparts, his biggest acquisition to date. \u201cThese are not short-term opportunistic deals. They represent real industrial change and are highly strategic in nature,\u201d says Lomer. The City\u2019s financial advisers and lawyers \u2013 who make millions from big deals \u2013 have been busy but not as run off their feet as their peers in the US. \u201cSometimes it has felt like there\u2019s a party going on next door to which you\u2019re not invited,\u201d says Piers Prichard Jones, a partner at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, a law firm that has nonetheless worked on many of the big UK deals, including the Anheuser and Shell deals. \u201cThere have been some very big UK deals but not a flow of mid-market ones,\u201d says Prichard Jones. According to Dealogic, there have been \u00a3619bn worth of UK deals so far this year \u2013 way ahead of last year\u2019s \u00a3388bn \u2013 but the number of deals has come down. This year\u2019s figure is likely to fall well short of the \u00a3848bn recorded before the financial crash in 2007. While many deals look genuinely strategic from an industrial point of view \u2013 like Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s takeover of SAB Miller, which gives the merged group more than 30% of the world\u2019s beer market \u2013 others have been constructed with tax benefits in mind. One of these is Pfizer\u2019s bid for Allergan, which, if it goes through, should reduce Pfizer\u2019s corporation tax rate from the 35% it pays in the US to something closer to the 12.5% rate that applies to Allergan in Ireland. Prichard Jones thinks there\u2019s been an increasing riskiness about some of the recent deals: \u201cBecause a lot of deals are strategic, there have been a growing number of competition issues.\u201d That has resulted in target companies demanding big money if a deal gets derailed. Earlier this year, for example, Rexam\u2019s board demanded a \u00a3320m break fee \u2013 7% of the deal value \u2013 when it recommended a \u00a34.4bn bid from US rival Ball Corporation. The deal has still not completed. So far there is no sign yet of the elephant charge coming to an end. Prichard Jones says: \u201cM&amp;A is cyclical so the cycle will inevitably turn at some point. But it is obviously difficult to call when that will be. Interest rate rises are inevitable and that may dampen activity in the near term. But if the rises are gradual, the impact may not be very significant. \u201cThe greatest impact is likely to be caused by a loss of confidence, for example as a result of macroeconomic or geopolitical events or announced deals not completing.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "The rate rise heard around the world: Janet Yellen prepares for her big decision", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wall Street watchers are calling it the most seminal moment for the global economy since the collapse of Lehman Brothers unleashed a savage financial and economic crisis in 2008. This week, policymakers at the US Federal Reserve are finally expected to begin reversing the emergency measures they took as the world slid into recession. Janet Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chair, had signalled that the central bank could raise interest rates from their record low of 0.25% in September; but the downturn in the Chinese economy, and the resulting turmoil in financial markets, persuaded the Fed to stay its hand. However, with Yellen and her colleagues due to hold their December policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday this week, the scene has been carefully set for the first increase in US interest rates for almost a decade. \u201cThis would be the least surprising rate hike in living memory,\u201d says Russell Jones of Llewellyn Consulting. If, as most analysts expect, the Fed shrugs off the latest bout of market jitters and presses ahead, the impact of what is expected to be a quarter-point hike will be felt not just in American households and businesses, which will see the costs of borrowing rise, but right across the global economy. The US economy Governors on the Fed\u2019s open market committee (FOMC), which sets interest rates, have to focus primarily on the domestic economy. With firms creating jobs at a rapid pace, and GDP expanding at a relatively healthy annualised rate of 2.1% in the third quarter, it has become increasingly clear that they believe consumers and investors can withstand a modest increase. When official figures on Friday showed that retail sales grew by 0.2% in November, Steve Murphy, US economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cNot that there is much doubt any more, but this supports the case for a rate hike by the Fed next week.\u201d Most analysts believe the immediate impact on the US economy will be modest. Phil Lachowycz of Fathom says: \u201cIn terms of how it\u2019s going to be for the US economy, I think it will be absolutely fine. The US economy is very well prepared for a rate increase.\u201d However, the Fed will also be alive to the risk that, like other trigger-happy central banks since the crisis including Switzerland, Australia and Canada, it could end up reversing any rate rise because even a small increase is too much for the economy to take. \u201cThe problem I have with it is that if you look around the world over the last five or six years, most central banks that have tightened have ended up having to backtrack,\u201d says Jones. For that reason, the Fed is likely to use the statement that accompanies a move to signal that it is not embarking on an aggressive round of rate rises. Investors call this combination of pushing up rates while promising not to do too much a \u201cdovish hike\u201d. Neil Mellor of BNY Mellon says: \u201cWe\u2019ve felt all year long that whenever the hike comes, it is how they couch their view in the statement that matters. What happens next is all-important. It\u2019s verbal dexterity, really.\u201d However, not all policymakers are keen to act. FOMC member Lael Brainard used a recent speech to warn that the risks in the global economy, including the downturn in China, should give the Fed pause for thought. \u201cAlthough the outlook for domestic demand is good, global forces are weighing on net exports and inflation, and the risks from abroad appear tilted to the downside,\u201d she said. \u201cRisk-management considerations counsel a stance of waiting to see if the risks to the outlook diminish.\u201d However, Yellen insists that if it does come this week, a decision to raise rates should be regarded as a sign of confidence. \u201cWhen the committee begins to normalise the stance of policy, doing so will be a testament to how far our economy has come in recovering from the effects of the financial crisis and the great recession. In that sense, it is a day that I expect we all are looking forward to,\u201d she said in recent testimony to Congress. Emerging economies Even the anticipation of an increase in US rates, alongside the strengthening domestic economy, has caused the dollar to appreciate in recent months, and led investors to suck capital out of riskier emerging markets and back towards the US in anticipation of higher returns. Many emerging economies, from Turkey to Thailand, have seen their currencies depreciate sharply and borrowing costs rise, and there will be more to come if the Fed pulls the trigger this week. Some \u2013 particularly those, such as Brazil, that are oil exporters and are suffering from plunging commodity prices \u2013 have already been driven into recession. Economists at the International Monetary Fund, which urged the Fed to delay \u201clift-off\u201d, have warned that companies in emerging economies have been borrowing heavily, largely in dollars, making them potentially vulnerable to a stronger greenback. The IMF pointed out that business in emerging markets has quadrupled over the past decade, from $4tn in 2004 to over $18tn in 2014, and warned that if some of these loans turn sour, it will hit banks\u2019 balance sheets, causing them to rein in lending, and potentially triggering a credit crunch. \u201cShocks to the corporate sector could quickly spill over to the financial sector and generate a vicious cycle as banks curtail lending. Decreased loan supply would then lower aggregate demand and collateral values, further reducing access to finance and thereby economic activity, and in turn, increasing losses to the financial sector,\u201d it said. At the same time, China\u2019s currency, the yuan, is likely to come under fresh selling pressure as the dollar continues to rise, creating a dilemma for Beijing, which has been spending foreign exchange reserves on controlling the pace of depreciation. The UK Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has said he expects the decision about when to raise UK interest rates from their record low of 0.5% to \u201ccome into sharper relief\u201d around the turn of the year. Many analysts believe a Fed increase could pave the way for the Bank to act too, particularly if it is largely shrugged off by markets and consumers. However, Adam Posen, a former member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, says he believes there is no rush, and that the Bank should instead be fretting about the imbalances in the economy, such as the frothy housing market, and using its new \u201cmacroprudential\u201d tools to tackle them. Its financial policy committee can intervene to slow a credit boom, by tightening how much capital banks must hold against new loans, for example. \u201cIt\u2019s still an unbalanced economy that\u2019s being driven a lot by real estate, concentrated in the London area, and that\u2019s not a very sustainable growth pattern,\u201d Posen says. Instead of raising interest rates, he adds, \u201cI would like to see the financial policy committee being much more aggressive about the housing market than it has.\u201d The unbalanced state of the economic recovery was also raised in the IMF\u2019s annual report on the UK economy, published last week. The eurozone While the US economy has been looking resilient, the eurozone is flirting with deflation; rising US rates could create a fresh challenge for the fragile euro economy if they lead to a renewed bout of global market turbulence. Investors are intensely focused on monetary policy worldwide, reacting dramatically to any nuance, and another bout of volatile trading is the last thing European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi needs. Draghi disappointed markets at the ECB\u2019s latest policy meeting by failing to step up the pace of its \u20ac60bn a month bond-buying programme, which is aimed at preventing the eurozone sliding into deflation. The euro rose on the move \u2013 precisely the opposite of the effect central bankers hope to have with such quantitative easing. Many analysts expect the dollar to appreciate as the result of rising US rates, and if that continues to contribute to a weaker euro, it would be good news for eurozone exporters.",

      "body": "<p>Wall Street watchers are calling it the most seminal moment for the global economy since the collapse of Lehman Brothers unleashed a savage financial and economic crisis in 2008. This week, policymakers at the US Federal Reserve are finally expected to begin reversing the emergency measures they took as the world slid into recession.</p> <p>Janet Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chair, had signalled that the central bank could raise interest rates from their record low of 0.25% in September; but the downturn in the Chinese economy, and the resulting turmoil in financial markets, persuaded the Fed to stay its hand.</p> <p>However, with Yellen and her colleagues due to hold their December policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday this week, the scene has been carefully set for the first increase in US interest rates for almost a decade. \u201cThis would be the least surprising rate hike in living memory,\u201d says Russell Jones of Llewellyn Consulting.</p> <p>If, as most analysts expect, the Fed shrugs off the latest bout of market jitters and presses ahead, the impact of what is expected to be a quarter-point hike will be felt not just in American households and businesses, which will see the costs of borrowing rise, but right across the global economy.</p> <h2><strong>The US economy</strong></h2> <p>Governors on the Fed\u2019s open market committee (FOMC), which sets interest rates, have to focus primarily on the domestic economy. With firms creating jobs at a rapid pace, and GDP expanding at a relatively healthy annualised rate of 2.1% in the third quarter, it has become increasingly clear that they believe consumers and investors can withstand a modest increase.</p> <p>When official figures on Friday showed that retail sales grew by 0.2% in November, Steve Murphy, US economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cNot that there is much doubt any more, but this supports the case for a rate hike by the Fed next week.\u201d</p> <p>Most analysts believe the immediate impact on the US economy will be modest. Phil Lachowycz of Fathom says: \u201cIn terms of how it\u2019s going to be for the US economy, I think it will be absolutely fine. The US economy is very well prepared for a rate increase.\u201d</p> <p>However, the Fed will also be alive to the risk that, like other trigger-happy central banks since the crisis including Switzerland, Australia and Canada, it could end up reversing any rate rise because even a small increase is too much for the economy to take. \u201cThe problem I have with it is that if you look around the world over the last five or six years, most central banks that have tightened have ended up having to backtrack,\u201d says Jones.</p> <p>For that reason, the Fed is likely to use the statement that accompanies a move to signal that it is not embarking on an aggressive round of rate rises. Investors call this combination of pushing up rates while promising not to do too much a \u201cdovish hike\u201d. Neil Mellor of BNY Mellon says: \u201cWe\u2019ve felt all year long that whenever the hike comes, it is how they couch their view in the statement that matters. What happens next is all-important. It\u2019s verbal dexterity, really.\u201d</p> <p>However, not all policymakers are keen to act. FOMC member Lael Brainard used a recent speech to warn that the risks in the global economy, including the downturn in China, should give the Fed pause for thought. \u201cAlthough the outlook for domestic demand is good, global forces are weighing on net exports and inflation, and the risks from abroad appear tilted to the downside,\u201d she said. \u201cRisk-management considerations counsel a stance of waiting to see if the risks to the outlook diminish.\u201d</p> <p>However, Yellen insists that if it does come this week, a decision to raise rates should be regarded as a sign of confidence. \u201cWhen the committee begins to normalise the stance of policy, doing so will be a testament to how far our economy has come in recovering from the effects of the financial crisis and the great recession.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s political rhetoric is often at its most thrilling and memorable when it deals with abroad and uses the past. You need to be in your mid-70s to have even a fragmentary memory of the second world war, but its causes, heroes and villains continue to inform, or misinform, our understanding of present events. Hilary Benn speaks of \u201cfascism\u201d; Tony Blair warns of \u201cappeasement\u201d; Hitler strides the stage again in the form of Gaddafi and Saddam; somebody in parliament remembers to be Churchillian. The importance of long-ago battles to present national identities is easily mocked \u2013 Kosovo (1389) to the Serbians; Bannockburn (1314) to the Scots \u2013 but if England exists 500 years from now, the chances are that it will still be remembering 1940. As for abroad, the confidence that we can intervene benignly isn\u2019t confined to the right or the centre left or wherever Hilary Benn is now. Jeremy Corbyn always sounds more at ease addressing an intractable conflict, such as Palestine, than he does tackling problems nearer home \u2013 Scotland; the collapse of the steel industry \u2013 where, for better or worse, he might actually have some effect. He\u2019s the other side of the same imperial coin: not the militarist but the missionary who, as Dickens wrote of Mrs Jellyby, utters \u201cbeautiful sentiments\u201d about African orphans and the brotherhood of man while her own children run wild. Diana Athill, who turns 98 this month, puts it simply and well in her new book when she says, \u201cThe difference between being the hub of a vast empire and being a tiny island off the shores of, but not belonging to, Europe seems to be something they [present-day politicians] are unable to understand.\u201d This is more than a pity. It leaves a great hole in mainstream politics where arguments about Britain\u2019s present and future should be. This week, for example, the retailer Mike Ashley emerged as an outstanding example of business rapacity when the Guardian disclosed the working conditions inside his vast Derbyshire warehouse. Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct chain has made him the 22nd richest man in Britain, estimated by the Sunday Times Rich List to be worth \u00a33.5bn. Temporary workers at his warehouse, by contrast, get paid hourly rates that work out below the minimum wage and suffer the kind of indignities \u2013 including rigorous harangues over the public address system to work faster \u2013 that come straight from a dystopian novel. Ashley, as well as being very rich, is also the unpopular owner of Newcastle United. The items he sells are made cheaply in east Asia. His warehouse depends on cheap eastern European labour. Few individuals so neatly encapsulate the fortunes, in both senses, of modern Britain. A political view of him would be wonderful to hear \u2026 and, to be fair, Ed Miliband did attack his \u201cVictorian\u201d business practices in a speech last year, saying that the proportion of the workforce on zero-hours contracts \u2013 18,000 out of 20,000 employees \u2013 made Sports Direct \u201ca bad place to work\u201d. But the speech got only passing attention. It didn\u2019t evoke a glorious past. It made too few people care. Ashes to ashtray, dust to dust Big Tobacco is fighting a last-ditch stand against the standardisation of the cigarette packet. In the high court this week, the four largest manufacturers began their challenge to laws and regulations that, from May, will give the healthsecretary the power to oversee packet design. Their chance of winning looks slim; parliament passed the legislation with hardly a vote against, and France and Ireland are enacting similar laws. Images that were once ornaments to everyday European life \u2013 everyday European death, too, of course \u2013 are soon to be replaced by packets as white as a shroud. The gypsy dancer on Gitanes, the portrait of Robert Burns on Sweet Afton, the capstan on Capstan Full Strength: ashes to ashtray, dust to dust. Many other charming scenes and characters vanished long before. When I was a six- or seven-year-old, a craze for collecting cigarette packets suddenly gripped the children in our street. It was easy enough to find Woodbine, Capstan, Senior Service and Player\u2019s Navy Cut, harder to discover Churchman\u2019s and Kensitas and Craven A, rarest of all to bend into the gutter and retrieve a Three Castles or a Passing Cloud. In fact, I don\u2019t think I ever saw an example of the last until I was old enough to buy some. A luxury brand. Surviving smokers of a certain age will remember that the cigarettes were oval-shaped and the packet, which was pink, showed a cavalier enjoying an anachronistic fag during a break in the English civil war. There was genuine artistry in almost every design, from Woodbine\u2019s flowers (rather arts and craftsy) to Player\u2019s bearded sailor framed inside his lifebelt. Perhaps as seven-year-olds we unconsciously recognised that charm \u2013 were charmed by it, in fact. Certainly the packets were attractive to us long before nicotine was. How were we to know that Craven A\u2019s black cat purred a false promise \u2013 \u201cWill not affect your throat\u201d \u2013 or that the affable butler who welcomed us to Kensitas would eventually reveal himself as the doorkeeper to the tomb? Don\u2019t let Scotland be Trumped In 1907, the Glasgow and South Western Railway opened an elegant 100-room hotel for golfers next to what was to become a championship course at Turnberry on the Ayrshire coast. It was part of a small boom in resort hotels built by Scottish railway companies \u2013 its architect, James Miller, also played a role in the design of the last of them, at Gleneagles. For more than a century, all went well, or at least decorously, until last year, when Ayrshire woke up to discover the hotel had been bought by Donald Trump, who immediately renamed it the Trump Turnberry in the belief (surely mistaken even then) that his name brought trade. A boycott is needed. If he isn\u2019t forced to sell up within a year, we\u2019ll know what to think of golfers. Saturday slacking The wine bar El Vino\u2019s was famous as the venue of journalists when newspapers were still published in Fleet Street. Like a club or a grand hotel, it had rules. By the 1990s, the one that prevented women standing at the bar had gone. Men, however, were still required to wear jacket and tie, except on Saturday lunchtimes, when more casual dress was allowed. Not jeans, probably, but the kind of rig favoured circa 1980 for country weekends: cavalry twills, Viyella shirts, roll-neck jumpers with leather elbow patches, quite possibly cravats. As a desk-worker on a Sunday paper, I never went to El Vino\u2019s on a Saturday lunch time, and only rarely at other times, but I noticed its effect in the office. Senior men \u2013 gregarious columnists and suchlike \u2013 who wore dark suits on weekdays now appeared tieless in beige and brown. Saturdays gave them that licence. Something similar now happens on Radio 4. On Saturdays, from 7am until mid-morning, it puts on its cavalry twills and laughs \u2013 not audience laughter, but journalists and broadcasters laughing among themselves as though they\u2019d been ordered to relax. Anne Perkins wrote a perceptive piece recently in the Guardian about reporters crying on camera \u2013 a new phenomenon that risks ending that useful fiction, the reporter\u2019s judge-like neutrality. Saturday mornings on Radio 4 inhabit the other end of the emotional spectrum, in chummy merriment. Everybody\u2019s at El Vino\u2019s now \u2013 apart, that is, from the listener.",

This week, for example, the retailer Mike Ashley emerged as an outstanding example of business rapacity when the Guardian disclosed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">working conditions inside his vast Derbyshire warehouse</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/16/sports-direct-corporate-governance-needs-a-radical-overhaul\">Sports Direct\u2019s corporate governance needs a radical overhaul | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct chain has made him the <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/sunday-times-rich-list-wealthiest-9120675\">22nd richest man in Britain</a>, estimated by the Sunday Times Rich List to be worth \u00a33.5bn. Temporary workers at his warehouse, by contrast, get paid hourly rates that work out below the minimum wage and suffer the kind of indignities \u2013 including rigorous harangues over the public address system to work faster \u2013 that come straight from a dystopian novel. Ashley, as well as being very rich, is also the unpopular owner of Newcastle United. The items he sells are made cheaply in east Asia. His warehouse depends on cheap eastern European labour. Few individuals so neatly encapsulate the fortunes, in both senses, of modern Britain.</p> <p>A political view of him would be wonderful to hear \u2026 and, to be fair, Ed Miliband did attack his \u201cVictorian\u201d business practices <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/15/ed-miliband-sports-direct-zero-hours-contracts\">in a speech last year</a>, saying that the proportion of the workforce on zero-hours contracts \u2013 18,000 out of 20,000 employees \u2013 made Sports Direct \u201ca bad place to work\u201d. But the speech got only passing attention. It didn\u2019t evoke a glorious past. It made too few people care.</p> <h2>Ashes to ashtray, dust to dust</h2> <p>Big Tobacco is fighting a last-ditch stand against the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35058074\">standardisation of the cigarette packet</a>. In the high court this week, the four largest manufacturers began their challenge to laws and regulations that, from May, will give the healthsecretary the power to oversee packet design. Their chance of winning looks slim; parliament passed the legislation with hardly a vote against, and France and Ireland are enacting similar laws. Images that were once ornaments to everyday European life \u2013 everyday European death, too, of course \u2013 are soon to be replaced by packets as white as a shroud. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gitanes\">gypsy dancer on Gitanes</a>, the portrait of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Afton_(cigarette)\">Robert Burns on Sweet Afton</a>, the capstan on <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Capstan+Full+Strength&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=mQlH5gXbRgacMM%253A%253BF5to9cdY0VtobM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.cigarety.by%25252Fbrand.php%25253Fn%2525253D10%25252526l%2525253D2%25252526p%2525253D0%25252526w%2525253DCAPSTAN%2525252B&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=mQlH5gXbRgacMM%253A%252CF5to9cdY0VtobM%252C_&amp;biw=1744&amp;bih=1058&amp;usg=__jKeI89YkM7i97x_wXgBIOrXqX4o%3D&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirodDwo9TJAhWBRBoKHWDRB4kQyjcIMQ&amp;ei=3wBrVuu1JYGJaeCin8gI#imgrc=mQlH5gXbRgacMM%3A&amp;usg=__jKeI89YkM7i97x_wXgBIOrXqX4o%3D\">Capstan Full Strength</a>: ashes to ashtray, dust to dust.</p> <p>Many other charming scenes and characters vanished long before. When I was a six- or seven-year-old, a craze for collecting cigarette packets suddenly gripped the children in our street. It was easy enough to find Woodbine, Capstan, Senior Service and Player\u2019s Navy Cut, harder to discover Churchman\u2019s and Kensitas and Craven A, rarest of all to bend into the gutter and retrieve a Three Castles or a Passing Cloud. In fact, I don\u2019t think I ever saw an example of the last until I was old enough to buy some. A luxury brand. Surviving smokers of a certain age will remember that the cigarettes were oval-shaped and the packet, which was pink, showed a cavalier enjoying an anachronistic fag during a break in the English civil war.</p> <p>There was genuine artistry in almost every design, from Woodbine\u2019s flowers (rather arts and craftsy) to Player\u2019s bearded sailor framed inside his lifebelt. Perhaps as seven-year-olds we unconsciously recognised that charm \u2013 were charmed by it, in fact. Certainly the packets were attractive to us long before nicotine was. How were we to know that Craven A\u2019s black cat purred a false promise \u2013 \u201cWill not affect your throat\u201d \u2013 or that the affable butler who welcomed us to Kensitas would eventually reveal himself as the doorkeeper to the tomb?</p> <h2>Don\u2019t let Scotland be Trumped</h2> <p>In 1907, the Glasgow and South Western Railway opened an elegant 100-room hotel for golfers next to what was to become a championship course at Turnberry on the Ayrshire coast. It was part of a small boom in resort hotels built by Scottish railway companies \u2013 its architect, James Miller, also played a role in the design of the last of them, at Gleneagles. For more than a century, all went well, or at least decorously, until last year, when Ayrshire woke up to discover the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/29/donald-trump-turnberry-golf-course-resort\">hotel had been bought by Donald Trump</a>, who immediately renamed it the Trump Turnberry in the belief (surely mistaken even then) that his name brought trade. A boycott is needed. If he isn\u2019t forced to sell up within a year, we\u2019ll know what to think of golfers.</p> <h2>Saturday slacking</h2> <p>The wine bar El Vino\u2019s was famous as the venue of journalists when newspapers were still published in Fleet Street. Like a club or a grand hotel, it had rules. By the 1990s, the one that prevented women standing at the bar had gone. Men, however, were still required to wear jacket and tie, except on Saturday lunchtimes, when more casual dress was allowed. Not jeans, probably, but the kind of rig favoured circa 1980 for country weekends: cavalry twills, Viyella shirts, roll-neck jumpers with leather elbow patches, quite possibly cravats. As a desk-worker on a Sunday paper, I never went to El Vino\u2019s on a Saturday lunch time, and only rarely at other times, but I noticed its effect in the office. Senior men \u2013 gregarious columnists and suchlike \u2013 who wore dark suits on weekdays now appeared tieless in beige and brown. Saturdays gave them that licence.</p> <p>Something similar now happens on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/radio4\">Radio 4</a>. On Saturdays, from 7am until mid-morning, it puts on its cavalry twills and laughs \u2013 not audience laughter, but journalists and broadcasters laughing among themselves as though they\u2019d been ordered to relax. Anne Perkins wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/18/reporter-emotion-bbc-graham-satchell-paris-attacks\">a perceptive piece</a> recently in the Guardian about reporters crying on camera \u2013 a new phenomenon that risks ending that useful fiction, the reporter\u2019s judge-like neutrality. Saturday mornings on Radio 4 inhabit the other end of the emotional spectrum, in chummy merriment. Everybody\u2019s at El Vino\u2019s now \u2013 apart, that is, from the listener.</p>",
