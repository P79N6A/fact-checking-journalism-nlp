The Centre for Economics and Business Research now believes a rise in May or August 2016 is more likely than one in February, its previous prediction. Signs of a global economic slowdown have been growing in recent weeks, especially in the world\u2019s second-largest economy China and emerging markets. This is likely to stay the Bank\u2019s hand despite reasonable growth rates in the UK, with the CEBR warning that the UK\u2019s performance may not be sustainable if economies elsewhere continue to struggle. It forecasts the UK economy will grow by 2.5% this year, slowing to 2% in 2016 and then averaging 1.7% over the years 2017-2020. In contrast, the Office for Budget Responsibility expects growth to remain above 2% over this period. The CEBR said if the global economy continued to falter, then these forecasts were at risk, with exports and business investment both likely to be hit. Scott Corfe, head of macroeconomics at CEBR, said: \u201cIt is clear that the global economy has deteriorated significantly over the past few months and there are significant downside risks to the UK\u2019s own prospects. \u201cWith inflation expected to remain below the Bank of England\u2019s central target of 2% until 2017, we think the Bank rate will remain on hold until the middle of next year. A rate rise in May or August seems most likely, to coincide with the inflation reports released in these months. \u201cEven when the Bank of England does raise rates, we expect the pace of rate rises to be very gradual.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce is facing further scrutiny over bribery allegations in Brazil after a high-level congressional commission told the Guardian it will investigate the company in connection with a sprawling corruption scandal. The beleaguered British engineering group now faces two investigations in Brazil after it admitted last month it is cooperating with investigating bodies, believed to include Brazil\u2019s federal anti-corruption authority. The commission confirmed the inquiry intends to examine Rolls-Royce\u2019s relationship with Brazil\u2019s state-owned oil company, Petrobras, currently ensnared in a multibillion-dollar bribery scandal which has prompted political turmoil in the country. Manoel Alvim, the commission\u2019s secretary, said it has requested documents from the UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which is conducting its own separate investigation into alleged corruption at Rolls-Royce. The SFO has not answered the request. The inquiry, formed earlier this year and made up of members from Brazil\u2019s lower chamber, could summon Rolls-Royce executives to testify in public hearings. In Brazil, an inquiry of this kind has broad investigative powers \u2013 including the authority to compel witnesses to testify under oath and require financial institutions to provide private banking details. So far, the inquiry has summoned senior politicians and executives from Petrobras and its contractors. Rolls-Royce was first dragged into the scandal in February after a former Petrobras executive alleged the group paid him and others bribes in exchange for contracts with the oil company. Rolls-Royce said the company has repeatedly made clear it will not tolerate business misconduct of any kind, but was unable to comment on its cooperation with investigating authorities. Over the past decade, the Derby-based company has won hundreds of millions of pounds worth of contracts with Petrobras to supply power turbines for offshore oil platforms. The congressional commission\u2019s inquiry opens up a new front in the corruption inquiries that Rolls-Royce is facing. The company is currently cooperating with Brazilian authorities believed to include the country\u2019s anti-corruption authority, the Office of the Comptroller General (CGU). CGU officials are currently investigating scores of Petrobras contractors over alleged bribery as part of the sweeping scandal that has hit Brazil\u2019s faltering economy and triggered a domestic political crisis. A CGU investigation could have serious consequences for Rolls-Royce. If the authority brings proceedings, it could face fines of up to 20% of revenues. The GCU can also strike leniency deals with companies if they pay damages and admit wrongdoing. The CGU was unable to comment on questions regarding Rolls-Royce. The spokeswoman said: \u201cThe CGU is silent on the research work in progress until they are finalised.\u201d Last month, the Guardian reported that investigations into an influential Brazilian businessman who claimed his consultancy represented Rolls-Royce in Brazil have intensified. The businessman, Julio Faerman, has struck a plea bargain with prosecutors in Rio de Janeiro. In June he appeared before the congressional inquiry to answer questions about bribery allegations. Faerman has denied any wrongdoing. Rolls-Royce has been under pressure over corruption allegations since late 2013 after the SFO launched a criminal investigation into alleged bribery in Indonesia and China. The SFO\u2019s director said last year that the investigation concerned several divisions of the company. The SFO was unable to comment on whether the investigation is now looking at the company\u2019s activity in Brazil. In March 2014, Rolls-Royce disclosed it is also cooperating with investigators at the US Department of Justice in connection with the SFO\u2019s investigation. The involvement of federal authorities in multiple jurisdictions could increase the range of any fines the company may be ordered to pay. In response to cross-border investigations, Rolls-Royce has hired New York law firm Debevoise &amp; Plimpton. Meanwhile, the company continues to suffer financially with some investors calling for the group to be broken up. In July, Rolls-Royce\u2019s new chief executive Warren East was forced to issue a profit warning on his second day in the job - the company\u2019s fourth profit warning in 18 months.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As the post-lunch slump sets in, many office workers opt for a coffee or chocolate to keep their eyes open, risking sleeplessness or a sugar crash. It is at times like this, its inventors believe, that a new wearable device can stimulate users via a tiny pulse that will heighten their mood or bring it down if they want to relax. At first glance, the Doppel resembles a traditional watch, albeit one with the clock face on backwards and worn under the wrist. Behind the stainless steel base is not a timepiece, however, but a vibrating motor that gives off a range of mechanical pulses aimed at improving how the user feels. In a similar way to fast or slow-paced music dictating the natural rhythm of the body, the vibrations from the Doppel can control how alert or relaxed the user is, according to co-creator Jack Hooper. \u201cEveryone tries to change their state \u2013 they listen to music, they drink coffee, they meditate \u2013 and we see this as another tool and a very effective tool because it is so discreet and it is controllable,\u201d he says. The Doppel has been developed by Hooper, Nell Bennett, Andreas Bilicki and Fotini Markopoulou following their research in psychophysiology \u2013 the relationship between mental and physical actions \u2013 while studying at the Royal College of Art in London. One of the areas they looked at was in \u201cmovement entrainment\u201d, where people synchronise with others in their environment by walking in pace with each other, and whether they could create a similar sort of effect. They found that a beat connected to the body could mirror the tempo of music and how it stimulated and calmed. \u201cWe had found that we could achieve this effect with a tactile beat which means that it is very, very discreet,\u201d Hooper says. \u201cIt is not like music that is going to cut you off or distract you. You could make someone more excited or calm them down. It is not going to make you happy or sad. \u201cWe found that we could change someone\u2019s state in this way. We had something which could only ever be a wearable in that it had to be touching [the skin].\u201d After further testing the Doppel was born. The device vibrates according to pre-set criteria. The process begins by the user measuring their resting heartbeat via a smartphone app. They then programme a series of vibration settings for when they are at rest \u2013 typically less than the resting heart rate \u2013 and when they are performing an activity such as running or trying to perk up from the mid-afternoon slump, typically higher. The phone then dictates these vibration rates to the Doppel via Bluetooth. The user can then decide which one they want to use depending on whether they want to rouse themselves or relax. \u201cWe have a theory about how it works and it is difficult to say whether it is true or not. We think what might be happening is we make it feel like a heartbeat and it sits on your pulse where you expect to feel a heartbeat and then if that goes faster, we think what we might be doing is confusing your brain to go: \u2018Oh, my heart rate has gone up, I must be more stimulated\u2019. And so it gets you going,\u201d Hooper says Uses for the device range from an aid to calm nerves before, say, a presentation or for help sleeping, to having a consistent beat for exercising. For those with mild forms of anxiety, it can work to calm them down, he claims. The difficulty lies in trying to explain to people what exactly the new device is and why they would need it. \u201cFor us, it meets a need in that technology at the moment leads us down a path to be more alert and have demands on our time,\u201d Hooper says. \u201cIt is not just a tool which gives people the ability to do something or answer their emails quicker or be more productive, it actually gives them the control over how they feel, which is a different approach to take with technology, especially wearable technology.\u201d It is expected that the Doppel will start selling next May priced at about \u00a3100 after 800 pre-orders from a successful Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign are fulfilled. Integration into existing smartwatches is not envisaged for the first few generations of the device although it is a possibility in the future, according to the company. On average they expect the battery in the device to last for between three and five days before needing a recharge \u2013 if people use it in bursts at various times of the day. Tests have been carried out on hundreds of people so far, according to Hooper, and he said there was \u201czero evidence\u201d that the Doppel was in any way dangerous. Where there may be a problem, such as for those who have a heart problem and have been told not to listen to upbeat music, he suggests they consult a doctor. The creators hold back from saying their device can change a user\u2019s mood, instead saying it \u201cprovides a beat your brain works to\u201d. Effects have been noticeable in users who have been giving presentations and used it to calm down, says Hooper. \u201cI would not say that it overrides the heart but it gives you something else to focus on. You might say that it overrides what you are concentrating on.\u201d How the Doppel works The various settings \u2013 among others, for running, commuting or relaxing \u2013 are set on a smartphone, which can then be uploaded to the Doppel. When using the device, pressing it in the centre brings on the high beat. Stroking a sensitive ridge on the face of the Doppel slows the beat. Turning a dial around the edge of the device alters the intensity of the sensation, much like a volume control on a stereo. \u2022 You can read our archive of The Innovators columns here or on the Big Innovation Centre website, where you will find more information on how the centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

      "body": "<p><br><br>As the post-lunch slump sets in, many office workers opt for a coffee or chocolate to keep their eyes open, risking sleeplessness or a sugar crash. It is at times like this, its inventors believe, that a new wearable device can stimulate users via a tiny pulse that will heighten their mood or bring it down if they want to relax.</p> <p>At first glance, the Doppel resembles a traditional watch, albeit one with the clock face on backwards and worn under the wrist. Behind the stainless steel base is not a timepiece, however, but a vibrating motor that gives off a range of mechanical pulses aimed at improving how the user feels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/20/the-innovators-hoverboard-technology-to-become-normal-in-homes\">The innovators: levitating lightbulbs take design back to the future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a similar way to fast or slow-paced music dictating the natural rhythm of the body, the vibrations from the Doppel can control how alert or relaxed the user is, according to co-creator Jack Hooper.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone tries to change their state \u2013 they listen to music, they drink coffee, they meditate \u2013 and we see this as another tool and a very effective tool because it is so discreet and it is controllable,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The Doppel has been developed by Hooper, Nell Bennett, Andreas Bilicki and Fotini Markopoulou following their research in psychophysiology \u2013 the relationship between mental and physical actions \u2013 while studying at the Royal College of Art in London. One of the areas they looked at was in \u201cmovement entrainment\u201d, where people synchronise with others in their environment by walking in pace with each other, and whether they could create a similar sort of effect. They found that a beat connected to the body could mirror the tempo of music and how it stimulated and calmed.</p> <p>\u201cWe had found that we could achieve this effect with a tactile beat which means that it is very, very discreet,\u201d Hooper says. \u201cIt is not like music that is going to cut you off or distract you. You could make someone more excited or calm them down. It is not going to make you happy or sad. </p> <p>\u201cWe found that we could change someone\u2019s state in this way. We had something which could only ever be a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/wearable-technology\">wearable</a> in that it had to be touching [the skin].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a1cfe8ecebaf57dff41da681d795f114e61c990\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/27/1443360760195/d23d2af2-e7de-4bc9-ba67-35d5a78bce5d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Doppel device and its creators\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Doppel gang and their new device.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After further testing the Doppel was born. The device vibrates according to pre-set criteria. The process begins by the user measuring their resting heartbeat via a smartphone app. They then programme a series of vibration settings for when they are at rest \u2013 typically less than the resting heart rate \u2013 and when they are performing an activity such as running or trying to perk up from the mid-afternoon slump, typically higher. The phone then dictates these vibration rates to the Doppel via Bluetooth. The user can then decide which one they want to use depending on whether they want to rouse themselves or relax.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a theory about how it works and it is difficult to say whether it is true or not. We think what might be happening is we make it feel like a heartbeat and it sits on your pulse where you expect to feel a heartbeat and then if that goes faster, we think what we might be doing is confusing your brain to go: \u2018Oh, my heart rate has gone up, I must be more stimulated\u2019. And so it gets you going,\u201d Hooper says</p> <p>Uses for the device range from an aid to calm nerves before, say, a presentation or for help sleeping, to having a consistent beat for exercising. For those with mild forms of anxiety, it can work to calm them down, he claims.</p> <p>The difficulty lies in trying to explain to people what exactly the new device is and why they would need it. \u201cFor us, it meets a need in that technology at the moment leads us down a path to be more alert and have demands on our time,\u201d Hooper says. </p> <p>\u201cIt is not just a tool which gives people the ability to do something or answer their emails quicker or be more productive, it actually gives them the control over how they feel, which is a different approach to take with technology, especially wearable technology.\u201d</p> <p>It is expected that the Doppel will start selling next May priced at about \u00a3100 after 800 pre-orders from a successful <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1799505246/doppel-a-new-breed-of-wearable-technology-to-set-y/description\">Kickstarter</a> crowd-funding campaign are fulfilled. Integration into existing smartwatches is not envisaged for the first few generations of the device although it is a possibility in the future, according to the company. On average they expect the battery in the device to last for between three and five days before needing a recharge \u2013 if people use it in bursts at various times of the day.</p> <p>Tests have been carried out on hundreds of people so far, according to Hooper, and he said there was \u201czero evidence\u201d that the Doppel was in any way dangerous. Where there may be a problem, such as for those who have a heart problem and have been told not to listen to upbeat music, he suggests they consult a doctor.</p> <p>The creators hold back from saying their device can change a user\u2019s mood, instead saying it \u201cprovides a beat your brain works to\u201d. Effects have been noticeable in users who have been giving presentations and used it to calm down, says Hooper. </p> <p>\u201cI would not say that it overrides the heart but it gives you something else to focus on. You might say that it overrides what you are concentrating on.\u201d</p> <h2>How the Doppel works</h2> <p>The various settings \u2013 among others, for running, commuting or relaxing \u2013 are set on a smartphone, which can then be uploaded to the Doppel. When using the device, pressing it in the centre brings on the high beat. Stroking a sensitive ridge on the face of the Doppel slows the beat. Turning a dial around the edge of the device alters the intensity of the sensation, much like a volume control on a stereo.</p> <p><em>\u2022 You can read our archive of The Innovators columns <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/series/the-innovators\">here </a>or <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.biginnovationcentre.com/the-innovators-column\">on the Big Innovation Centre website</a>, where you will find more information on how the centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "A reputation for economic competence can be lost in a day and take a generation to win back. Ask the Conservatives. George Soros did for them on 16 September 1992 when his selling of the pound drove Britain out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The Conservatives lost three elections on the trot after Black Wednesday. Labour, too, knows how long the rehabilitation process can be. No single event was to blame for Jim Callaghan losing the 1979 election; rather it was the combination of record peacetime inflation, a sterling crisis, a squeeze on living standards and the Winter of Discontent. There followed an 18-year gap before voters were again prepared to trust Labour with their money. So, the challenge for Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, this week is obvious. Labour can win the next election only if the public is convinced that the opposition will make a decent fist of running the economy. If it is not convinced, it will stick with the status quo, as it did in May. The evidence from the last parliament is that voters formed a view of Labour under Ed Miliband\u2019s leadership pretty quickly, so what the Corbyn team says and does in its first few weeks will be crucial. The fact that Corbyn\u2019s opinion poll ratings are even lower than those for Michael Foot in his early days as Labour leader in 1980 highlights the danger. In the next two days, Corbyn and McDonnell have their best, perhaps their only, opportunity to show that Labour has a credible economic plan. It is a recognition of how tough this task is going to be that McDonnell feels it necessary tell the party conference on Monday that a future Labour government would live within its means. Corbyn and McDonnell will be hoping to exploit the fact that the UK economy has not really recovered from the financial crisis and economic downturn of 2008-09, despite almost seven years of 0.5% interest rates and \u00a3375bn of money creation through the government\u2019s quantitative easing programme. Borrowing by the state is much higher than planned and deficit reduction is way off course. Jobs have been created but they have tended to be low-paid and low-skill. As a result, Britain\u2019s productivity gap with other leading G7 countries narrowed under John Major and Tony Blair but has since widened to 20% \u2013 its highest level since the data were first collected in 1991. The financial crisis has left Britain a much poorer country than it would have been had the crash never happened. Had output per head continued to grow at its pre-slump level, it would be 18% higher than its present level. The economy grew strongly in 2013 and 2014, and the Office for National Statistics is likely this week to revise up its estimates of growth in both years, but there have been signs recently of a slowdown. This could be a blip, but it might not be. Andrew Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England, floated the idea this month that a third stage of the global economic crisis is upon us. Stage one was the meltdown in the banks; stage two was the near-collapse of the eurozone; stage three threatens to be trouble in emerging markets. A fresh downturn would create a real headache for policymakers. Faced with higher budget deficits caused by slower growth, would they intensify austerity programmes? With interest rates already virtually zero, would they respond by cranking up the electronic printing presses for a further dose of QE? The answers to these two questions are no and yes. Finance ministries would ease up on austerity and contemplate new ways to stimulate the economy. In these circumstances, Corbyn\u2019s flagship policies \u2013 against austerity and in favour of People\u2019s QE \u2013 would be in line with mainstream thinking. As was discovered after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, in a crisis anything goes. Haldane has mused about the possibility of charging negative interest rates for people holding cash; an alternative would be so-called helicopter drops of money, with the Bank of England creating enough money to allow the Treasury to write a cheque to every adult in the land. People\u2019s quantitative easing is simply an alternative form of helicopter money, a term patented by that well-known leftie Milton Friedman. It would provide an anti-recessionary demand boost to the economy, but do so through investment rather than consumption, and so with less of a negative effect on Britain\u2019s already worryingly high balance of payments deficit. Labour would have a perfectly respectable plan for dealing with the crisis. Even better, they could turn the tables on the Conservatives and accuse them of \u201cfailing to mend the roof while the sun was shining\u201d. The (utterly preposterous) charge that Labour caused the global financial crisis of 2008 would no longer have the same political potency. It sounds simple, but it won\u2019t be. For a start, there might not be another financial crisis any time soon. Should the economy continue to grow at a reasonable rate with wage growth outpacing inflation, it will be harder for Labour to get a hearing. Corbyn and McDonnell will have to show that they have answers to chronic rather than acute problems: weak productivity, under-investment, and the current account deficit. Labour would need to tackle one of its own perennial weaknesses: the perception that it knows a lot more about how to spend money than how to make it. There is also the possibility that there is a crisis between now and 2020 but that the public decides that voting Labour is too risky. The precedent here is the 1992 election, which took place at the tail end of a recession entirely caused by Conservative economic mismanagement that led to a colossal boom bust in the housing market resulting in record home repossessions and business failures, and 3 million people on the dole. Times were tough but voters thought they would be even tougher under Labour. They stuck with the Tories. The 1997 election was different. By then the economy was in its fifth year of strong growth so voting Labour was not so risky. The Conservatives got no credit for the recovery, since it only began after the enforced change in policy forced on Major by the humiliation of Black Wednesday. Conditions were perfect for a Labour victory. The fact that the flaws in Tony Blair\u2019s blueprint for making Labour economically credible were exposed in the financial crisis of 2008 means that the process has to begin again. That\u2019s the challenge for Corbyn. If voters trust him with their money he can win. If they see him as the bloke who didn\u2019t sing the national anthem and thinks every economic problem can be solved by printing more money, Labour will lose, and lose badly.",

      "bodyText": "Why did chancellor George Osborne have to scuttle off to China last week to round up funding for Hinkley Point, the expensive nuclear power station he wants to build in Somerset? The short answer is that every sensible investor decided long ago to give this troubled project a wide berth. Centrica, owner of British Gas, was the most high-profile refusenik. In 2013, it decided it could no longer throw good money after bad and took a \u00a3200m write-off rather than commit to a 20% stake. Former chief executive Sam Laidlaw\u2019s investment record at Centrica was patchy but his judgment on that occasion was impeccable. \u201cSince our initial investment, the anticipated project costs in new nuclear have increased and the construction timetable has extended by a number of years,\u201d he said. Since then, Hinkley\u2019s costs have ballooned to \u00a324bn and the timetable been stretched ever further. The last government\u2019s response was to agree a absurdly generous \u201cstrike\u201d price of \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour for Hinkley\u2019s output. Yet still it\u2019s a struggle to get the investors to sign up. The European pressurised reactors (EPRs) that EDF, lead backer of Hinkley, is building in Finland and on home turf in Normandy are massively over budget and years behind schedule. \u201cFor third parties observing the announcements of delays and cost overruns for the EPRs under construction, it is difficult to commit,\u201d Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy, chief executive of EDF, told French newspaper Les Echos last week. Don\u2019t worry, continued L\u00e9vy, the Chinese \u201cstill have confidence in the EPR\u201d. Up to a point. They, like everyone else, can see Osborne is desperate. They also require loan guarantees and a pledge that they can build their own nuclear plant (to a different design, naturally) in Essex. In short, the Chinese have Osborne over a barrel. One wonders what other incentives have been offered to avoid a humiliating U-turn on Hinkley. The final deal, assuming it is agreed, should be published in full: and parliament should comb every line.",

      "bodyText": "Everyone does it. These are the words that have often sparked history\u2019s great corporate scandals. Companies or industries become detached from reality, and illegal or improper practices become seen as normal. It eventually ends in disaster. This was the case for traders and Libor, and now it could be the case for the automotive industry. At present, only Volkswagen has admitted using a \u201cdefeat device\u201d to rig emissions tests on diesel engines. Other leading carmakers, such as BMW and Daimler, the owner of Mercedes-Benz, have fiercely denied manipulating data. However, the slide in the shares of all carmakers last week suggests that many people aren\u2019t so sure. Whether other carmakers are dragged into the scandal or not, the events of the last week will have a profound impact on the automotive world. First, VW \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest vehicle manufacturer \u2013 is going to change dramatically. While the scandal may be rooted in an industry-wide disdain for emissions tests, it is no coincidence that VW has been caught first and on such a grand scale. The revelations have shone a light on how dysfunctional the carmaker has become and the lengths it went to in a bid to succeed in the US. Based in Wolfsburg, 350 miles from Munich and 150 miles from Berlin, VW seems to have become ignorant of the world around it. The Porsche and Piech families own the majority of VW, with Lower Saxony and Qatar also holding substantial stakes. This small base of shareholders allowed VW to become increasingly insular and aloof. It was also the personal fiefdom of Ferdinand Piech, who was in charge as chief executive and chairman for more than 20 years until April. Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive until Wednesday, was his ally and did little to prevent this. If Winterkorn and Piech were to meet their goal of VW becoming the world\u2019s biggest carmaker, they needed to crack the US. In order to crack the US, VW needed to persuade American drivers to buy its diesel cars, which the German company had promoted as its unique, environmentally friendly selling point. Thus, VW was under pressure to increase sales in the US. It now appears that this pressure, mixed with a dysfunctional corporate culture, was a toxic mix. The company will have to show the world it has changed and made a fresh start to recover from this scandal. That process will start with the construction of a new management team and corporate structure. It should survive, even if it has to pay a potential $18bn in US fines, plus other penalties in Europe and consumer claims. But past corporate scandals show there are years of hard rebuilding work ahead. After Toyota\u2019s own recall crisis in 2010, its share price did not bottom out for another two years \u2013 and the Japanese manufacturer was not deliberately rigging its cars. VW has to recover from damaged customer perceptions, a sharp rise in the cost of financing its bonds, a possible big hit to sales, a probable loss of its valuable pricing power, and its share price falling by a third. It may turn out that the lasting legacy of this crisis is not the damage done to VW, but the hit to diesel cars and the combustion engine. Amid the chaos of the last week, it was little noticed that shares at Tesla, the electric car manufacturer, rose more than 5%. Sales of diesel cars have grown sharply in Europe as governments have backed them with tax breaks. Half of new car sales in the UK are now diesel. In the US, support has not been as forthcoming and diesel has just 3% of the market. Any support for diesel cars is now going to be put into reverse, and sales will fall with it. If it subsequently emerges that tests on petrol engines and fuel mileage figures have also been fixed, then all bets \u2013 apart from those on Tesla\u2019s share price \u2013 are off. What price avoiding humiliation at Hinkley? Why did chancellor George Osborne have to scuttle off to China last week to round up funding for Hinkley Point, the expensive nuclear power station he wants to build in Somerset? The short answer is that every sensible investor decided long ago to give this troubled project a wide berth. Centrica, owner of British Gas, was the most high-profile refusenik. In 2013, it decided it could no longer throw good money after bad and took a \u00a3200m write-off rather than commit to a 20% stake. Former chief executive Sam Laidlaw\u2019s investment record at Centrica was patchy but his judgment on that occasion was impeccable. \u201cSince our initial investment, the anticipated project costs in new nuclear have increased and the construction timetable has extended by a number of years,\u201d he said. Since then, Hinkley\u2019s costs have ballooned to \u00a324bn and the timetable been stretched ever further. The last government\u2019s response was to agree a absurdly generous \u201cstrike\u201d price of \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour for Hinkley\u2019s output. Yet still it\u2019s a struggle to get the investors to sign up. The European pressurised reactors (EPRs) that EDF, lead backer of Hinkley, is building in Finland and on home turf in Normandy are massively over budget and years behind schedule. \u201cFor third parties observing the announcements of delays and cost overruns for the EPRs under construction, it is difficult to commit,\u201d Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy, chief executive of EDF, told French newspaper Les Echos last week. Don\u2019t worry, continued L\u00e9vy, the Chinese \u201cstill have confidence in the EPR\u201d. Up to a point. They, like everyone else, can see Osborne is desperate. They also require loan guarantees and a pledge that they can build their own nuclear plant (to a different design, naturally) in Essex. In short, the Chinese have Osborne over a barrel. One wonders what other incentives have been offered to avoid a humiliating U-turn on Hinkley. The final deal, assuming it is agreed, should be published in full: and parliament should comb every line. Women retailers left on the shelf In respected retailer John Timpson\u2019s new book High Street Heroes \u2013 The Story of British Retail in 50 People \u2013 only one woman earns her own chapter: Anita Roddick. Roddick built the Body Shop into an international business, demonstrating ethics and financial success could be combined. She challenged the status quo \u2013 but so did Mary Perkins, who built the Specsavers empire, and Jacqueline Gold, who runs Ann Summers. They are bundled together in one chapter. And Timpson has completely missed some other groundbreaking retailers, such as Natalie Massenet of online fashion retailer Net-a-Porter, or Jane Shepherdson, who did so much to build the Topshop brand and revive Whistles. But perhaps Timpson can be excused. While the vast majority of money spent on the high street comes out of women\u2019s purses and is handed over to women at the tills, nearly all the UK\u2019s major retailers are controlled by men. The high street faces enormous challenges and needs fresh perspective more than ever. Women need a bigger part in the next chapter of retail.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Chinese hard hats are red, we discovered last week. George Osborne, never slow to slip into industrial workwear, had several opportunities to model one during his five-day-long grand tour, as he gladhanded officials, chatted to workers, and urged Chinese firms to help build Britain\u2019s \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d. The chancellor\u2019s Chinese jaunt, on which an extraordinary six other ministers joined him at various points, was part of a concerted strategy to paint himself as a forward-thinking free trader at ease on the world stage \u2013 and, of course, to suck up to the Chinese authorities. \u201cWe are truly entering a golden era of cooperation between our two countries, and it\u2019s crucial that businesses and communities from across the UK feel the full benefit of forging closer economic links with China,\u201d he gushed. The feeling appeared to be mutual: the Global Times, a newspaper close to the Chinese state, later praised his \u201cdiplomatic etiquette\u201d in not raising \u201cthe human rights issue\u201d. \u201cKeeping a modest manner is the correct attitude for a foreign minister visiting China to seek business opportunities,\u201d it said. And by inviting the Chinese to come and build a new nuclear facility in Essex \u2013 and providing \u00a32bn in taxpayer guarantees to underpin the Hinkley project \u2013 Osborne appeared willing to set aside not just human rights concerns but safety, national security and even a basic cost-benefit analysis in exchange for the hand of Chinese friendship. We appear to be witnessing the O\u2019Neill-isation of economic policy. The chancellor\u2019s new commercial secretary, Lord (Jim) O\u2019Neill of Gatley, the former Goldman Sachs chief economist who accompanied him last week, has two longstanding obsessions \u2013 the rise and rise of the Chinese economy, and the creation of a northern powerhouse. Throwing open a \u201cnorthern pitchbook\u201d of \u00a324bn in investment opportunities to Chinese firms last week married the two. Indeed, donating \u00a33m of taxpayers\u2019 cash to train aspiring young Chinese footballers catered for O\u2019Neill\u2019s third great enthusiasm: the beautiful game. And perhaps there\u2019s nothing wrong with deepening cultural and commercial ties with a rising global power. Yet even for the most hard-nosed defender of the argument that commercial considerations should trump ethical qualms, the chancellor\u2019s timing last week looked distinctly odd. The days when China\u2019s ascent to global economic hegemony appeared assured, its appetite for exports insatiable, are long gone. Instead, Chinese influence on today\u2019s global economy is making itself felt through a domino-tumble of devaluations, layoffs and recessions that stretches from Russia to Brazil to South Africa (all members, along with India, of the \u201cBrics\u201d group of emerging countries: an acronym coined by O\u2019Neill). World trade is shrinking as China\u2019s demand for resources wanes; global commodity prices have plunged; emerging market currencies are being hammered. Last week alone, the South African rand, the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira all hit record lows against the dollar. The notion of \u201cdecoupling\u201d, fashionable in the wake of the 2008-09 crisis, under which China and the other major emerging markets would continue to drive global growth even as the US and Europe stalled, now looks defunct. In fact, China bought its continued economic resilience in recent years at the expense of a credit-fuelled boom in infrastructure projects, which has left a legacy of bad loans and swings in property markets. Now the authorities are struggling to manage the transition from an export-dominated economy towards a \u201cnew normal\u201d of steadier, services-led growth, while coping with the consequences of the credit bubble. The recent decision to devalue the yuan in the summer, albeit by a relatively modest 4% or so, suggested they may have decided growth is slowing more sharply than they are willing to tolerate. Many analysts believe they will do it again in the coming months. As Citigroup\u2019s Willem Buiter puts it, China is \u201ca messy market economy of the state-capitalist/crony-capitalist variety, where policy ambitions are not matched with effective policy instruments and where macroeconomic management and financial crisis prevention and mitigation competence are in short supply\u201d. And in today\u2019s interconnected global economy, China\u2019s problems quickly become everyone else\u2019s problems too. The 10,000 layoffs announced last week by US manufacturer Caterpillar, whose giant trucks are used in mining, appeared to be an early sign that the consequences of waning Chinese demand are rippling out from the commodities sector into industry. Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chair, made clear that the US\u2019s decision not to press ahead with a widely telegraphed plan to raise interest rates in September had its roots in the turmoil in China. In effect, the Fed was acknowledging that China\u2019s economy is too fragile to withstand higher American rates. Or, to put it another way, China\u2019s downturn is doing some of the Fed\u2019s work for it \u2013 bearing down on inflation, not just in the US but in scores of countries worldwide. And that includes Britain. China\u2019s biggest export these days is not plastic toys or iPhone parts: it\u2019s deflation, and the victims are already piling up. It\u2019s hard to feel much sympathy for the billionaire bosses of commodities trader Glencore, who have seen their fortunes chipped away by the crashing price of raw materials. But as Osborne was settling himself in to the window seat on another Chinese high-speed train last week, Britain\u2019s steelmakers were gathering in London to warn the government that, without being given \u201chalf a chance\u201d, they would be forced to shut down plants and lay off thousands of workers, as they struggle to cope with what they see as the dumping of cut-price Chinese steel on the world market. Osborne may believe he is playing a canny diplomatic game, calculating that closeness to the Chinese will pay off; but his enthusiasm for selling Britain by the yuan may yet come to look ill-judged.",

      "body": "<p>Chinese hard hats are red, we discovered last week. George Osborne, never slow to slip into industrial workwear, had several opportunities to model one during his five-day-long grand tour, as he gladhanded officials, chatted to workers, and urged Chinese firms to help build Britain\u2019s \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d.</p> <p>The chancellor\u2019s Chinese jaunt, on which an extraordinary six other ministers joined him at various points, was part of a concerted strategy to paint himself as a forward-thinking free trader at ease on the world stage \u2013 and, of course, to suck up to the Chinese authorities.</p> <p>\u201cWe are truly entering a golden era of cooperation between our two countries, and it\u2019s crucial that businesses and communities from across the UK feel the full benefit of forging closer economic links with China,\u201d he gushed.</p> <p>The feeling appeared to be mutual: the <em>Global Times</em>, a newspaper close to the Chinese state, later praised his \u201cdiplomatic etiquette\u201d in not raising \u201cthe human rights issue\u201d. \u201cKeeping a modest manner is the correct attitude for a foreign minister visiting China to seek business opportunities,\u201d it said.</p> <p>And by inviting the Chinese to come and build a new nuclear facility in Essex \u2013 and providing \u00a32bn in taxpayer guarantees to underpin the Hinkley project \u2013 Osborne appeared willing to set aside not just human rights concerns but safety, national security and even a basic cost-benefit analysis in exchange for the hand of Chinese friendship.</p> <p>We appear to be witnessing the O\u2019Neill-isation of economic policy. The chancellor\u2019s new commercial secretary, Lord (Jim) O\u2019Neill of Gatley, the former Goldman Sachs chief economist who accompanied him last week, has two longstanding obsessions \u2013 the rise and rise of the Chinese economy, and the creation of a northern powerhouse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>China\u2019s biggest export these days is not plastic toys or iPhone parts: it\u2019s deflation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Throwing open a \u201cnorthern pitchbook\u201d of \u00a324bn in investment opportunities to Chinese firms last week married the two. Indeed, donating \u00a33m of taxpayers\u2019 cash to train aspiring young Chinese footballers catered for O\u2019Neill\u2019s third great enthusiasm: the beautiful game.</p> <p>And perhaps there\u2019s nothing wrong with deepening cultural and commercial ties with a rising global power. Yet even for the most hard-nosed defender of the argument that commercial considerations should trump ethical qualms, the chancellor\u2019s timing last week looked distinctly odd.</p> <p>The days when China\u2019s ascent to global economic hegemony appeared assured, its appetite for exports insatiable, are long gone. Instead, Chinese influence on today\u2019s global economy is making itself felt through a domino-tumble of devaluations, layoffs and recessions that stretches from Russia to Brazil to South Africa (all members, along with India, of the \u201cBrics\u201d group of emerging countries: an acronym coined by O\u2019Neill).</p> <p>World trade is shrinking as China\u2019s demand for resources wanes; global commodity prices have plunged; emerging market currencies are being hammered. Last week alone, the South African rand, the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira all hit record lows against the dollar.</p> <p>The notion of \u201cdecoupling\u201d, fashionable in the wake of the 2008-09 crisis, under which China and the other major emerging markets would continue to drive global growth even as the US and Europe stalled, now looks defunct.</p> <p>In fact, China bought its continued economic resilience in recent years at the expense of a credit-fuelled boom in infrastructure projects, which has left a legacy of bad loans and swings in property markets. Now the authorities are struggling to manage the transition from an export-dominated economy towards a \u201cnew normal\u201d of steadier, services-led growth, while coping with the consequences of the credit bubble.</p> <p>The recent decision to devalue the yuan in the summer, albeit by a relatively modest 4% or so, suggested they may have decided growth is slowing more sharply than they are willing to tolerate. Many analysts believe they will do it again in the coming months. As <a href=\"http://willembuiter.com/China2015.pdf\" title=\"\">Citigroup\u2019s Willem Buiter puts it</a>, China is \u201ca messy market economy of the state-capitalist/crony-capitalist variety, where policy ambitions are not matched with effective policy instruments and where macroeconomic management and financial crisis prevention and mitigation competence are in short supply\u201d.</p> <p>And in today\u2019s interconnected global economy, China\u2019s problems quickly become everyone else\u2019s problems too. The 10,000 layoffs announced last week by US manufacturer Caterpillar, whose giant trucks are used in mining, appeared to be an early sign that the consequences of waning Chinese demand are rippling out from the commodities sector into industry.</p> <p>Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chair, made clear that the US\u2019s decision not to press ahead with a widely telegraphed plan to raise interest rates in September had its roots in the turmoil in China. In effect, the Fed was acknowledging that China\u2019s economy is too fragile to withstand higher American rates. Or, to put it another way, China\u2019s downturn is doing some of the Fed\u2019s work for it \u2013 bearing down on inflation, not just in the US but in scores of countries worldwide.</p> <p>And that includes Britain. China\u2019s biggest export these days is not plastic toys or iPhone parts: it\u2019s deflation, and the victims are already piling up.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to feel much sympathy for the billionaire bosses of commodities trader Glencore, who have seen their fortunes chipped away by the crashing price of raw materials. But as Osborne was settling himself in to the window seat on another Chinese high-speed train last week, Britain\u2019s steelmakers were gathering in London to warn the government that, without being given \u201chalf a chance\u201d, they would be forced to shut down plants and lay off thousands of workers, as they struggle to cope with what they see as the dumping of cut-price Chinese steel on the world market.</p> <p>Osborne may believe he is playing a canny diplomatic game, calculating that closeness to the Chinese will pay off; but his enthusiasm for selling Britain by the yuan may yet come to look ill-judged.</p>",
