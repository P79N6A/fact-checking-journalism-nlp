The result: a new record close for the blue-chip index of 6949. It has taken a decade and a half to surpass the old 1999 high. Will we now make up for lost time? Is it onwards and upwards for the stock market? Don\u2019t bank on it. That 1999 party, fuelled by dotcom intoxication, always seemed slightly unreal to those of us who wrote \u201cFootsie soars through 3000\u201d stories a mere six years earlier. Today\u2019s market also contains an unreliable ingredient \u2013 quantitative easing. Stock markets were first spiked with QE in late 2008, when the US Federal Reserve started buying Treasury bonds in the aftermath of the banking crash. One aim was to tickle risk appetites by pushing investors out of safety-first assets. It worked. As bond yields fell, investors turned to shares for income. The Bank of England joined the QE game in 2009 and the US Fed subsequently launched QE programmes 2 and 3. Now Japan, and soon the European Central Bank, are trying to keep the show going. It may work for a while. But, as lauded fund manager Neil Woodford was arguing the other day, central banks\u2019 money-printing machines may be losing their potency. First, QE worked when shares were cheap by historical standards; but it\u2019s hard to make that claim today as corporate earnings are plainly slowing. Second, the eurozone remains in the mire and the latest Greek fudge is far from being a permanent fix. To that list, one should add China. Growth there has slowed but consensus opinion still thinks 7% will be as bad as it gets. That may be another unreliable prop. Last year\u2019s plunge in the prices of industrial commodities \u2013 from iron ore to coal to oil \u2013 may suggest that real demand in China is weakening far faster than assumed. BHP, a big supplier of raw materials to China, illustrates the two-way investment pull. Its half-year underlying profits collapsed by almost a third to $5.3bn. But the shares rose because the level of cost-cutting was impressive and investors liked the commitment to invest less to protect a dividend that yields 5%. In BHP\u2019s case, self-help measures may indeed save a proud dividend record. But it\u2019s not the only major multinational taking multi-billion dollar chunks out of its investment programme; the oil companies are the same. Less capital spending and very low inflation are not normal backdrops to a strong stock market. After a six-year bull run, common sense says the risks to share prices are rising. What did Douglas Flint know about Swiss private bank? When Douglas Flint, HSBC chairman, appears before the Treasury select committee today, MPs\u2019 most important task is to establish a clear account of what the bank\u2019s top brass knew about practices within the Swiss private bank in 2005-2007. The bank has offered little insight so far. HSBC has apologised for past control and compliance failures but it has also presented the episode as if it belonged to another era when senior group directors didn\u2019t trouble themselves with local matters. It has said the Safra and Republic banks, which were bought in 1999 and formed the core of Swiss private bank, were \u201cnot fully integrated into HSBC, allowing different cultures and standards to persist\u201d. It has also said: \u201cHSBC was run in a more federated way than it is today and decisions were frequently taken at a country level.\u201d But what does \u201cnot fully integrated\u201d actually mean?

      "bodyText": "And finally finally, here\u2019s Europe editor Ian Traynor\u2019s news story on today\u2019s developments, confirming that the coming weeks will be difficult: Greece secures eurozone bailout extension for four months Greece\u2019s new leftwing government faces months of fraught negotiations with its creditors over how to ease its unsustainable debt levels and austerity programmes after securing - but only conditionally - a eurozone lifeline on Tuesday that wins it time until the end of June. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister and leader of the Syriza movement, had to bow to German-led pressure to stick to the broad terms of its \u20ac240bn (\u00a3176bn) bailout in order to obtain a four-month extension to the rescue he repeatedly pledged to scrap. Late on Monday the new finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, sent a six-page list of proposed economic reforms to Brussels which held to some of Tsipras\u2019s election campaign pledges, but largely diluted or abandoned them to win the support of the other 18 governments in the eurozone, and of the troika of bailout overseers from the European commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Despite Tsipras\u2019s assertions, for domestic consumption, that the hated troika is dead and that the bailout programme has been ditched, both remain very much in play, with the troika grudgingly blessing Tuesday\u2019s proposals from Athens and mandated to deliver a more detailed verdict by the end of April.......(for more click here) A quick PS. Over in Greece tonight, the flagship evening news programme on Skai TV is saying that the government will face a three-pronged opposition: from dissenters in Syriza, the oligarchs and \u201cvested interests\u201d that now have so much to lose if the new leftist-led administrations succeeds in reforming tax collection and clamping down on tax evasion and the opposition itself From Athens, Helena Smith adds: Tonight both the former prime minister Antonis Samaras and his deputy, socialist Pasok leader Evangelos Venizelos, accused the Tsipras government of taking Greece back into a \u201cthird memorandum\u201d with the country\u2019s creditors. Venizelos said: \u201cI am truly very sorry. We have lost a lot of time and instead of exiting the memorandum and moving onto a preliminary credit line with more relaxed conditions we will, come July, be moving into a third memorandum.\u201d There\u2019s also talk that Greece\u2019s pledge not to unravel privatisations is the major bone of contention among Syriza MPs. We sense trouble ahead..... Enrique Diaz, Chief Risk Officer at financial services provider Ebury, sums up the situation tonight: \u201cToday\u2019s green light to Greece was undoubtedly good news. The deal is a reasonable one for both sides. Although the Greeks have had to abandon many of their unrealistic initial requests, the Greek Government is now once again in control of the reform process. \u201cThat said, the outlook for the Euro remains bearish. The single currency only responded moderately to the news, rising by 0.4% against the Dollar. Given the ECB\u2019s recent injection of around \u20ac1.2 trillion into the economy, we should see continued downward pressure on the Euro against the Dollar over the next eighteen months.\u201d So, let\u2019s wrap up with a very quick summary after a long day.... Eurozone finance ministers have given their approval to Greece\u2019s economic reform plans, but the longer battle over the Greek bailout has just begun. The decision clears the way to a four-month bailout extension that will avoid the danger of Athens running out of funds, once national parliaments have also given the green light. The decision was taken on a conference call this afternoon, after the eurogroup had assessed a series of economic reforms sent by Greece late last night. [click here to read the proposals in full]. Those proposals strike a middle-ground between the demands of Greece\u2019s creditors, and the expectations of MPs in the Syriza party, and the Greek electorate. And all sides remain somewhat unsatisfied tonight. The International Monetary Fund has already warned that Greece\u2019s proposals don\u2019t meet its own expectations. While the European Central Bank warned that Greece can only replace existing austerity measures with new plans that are \u201cat least as effective\u201d. And PM Tsipras apparently faced some dissent at a cabinet meeting today. The financial markets, though, are pleased that the Greek crisis has eased (although national parliaments still need to give their approval). Athens stock market surged by 10%, while Greek borrowing costs fell sharply as investors treated its debt as less risky And in London, the FTSE 100 hit a new record high -- smashing through its dot-com peak. And analysts argue that the Footsie isn\u2019t overvalued, and could climb further.... I\u2019ll be back tomorrow to do it all again. Thanks, as ever, for reading and commenting. GW Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission vice-president for the Euro, tweets tonight that Greece\u2019s reform plan is a good \u201cfirst step\u201d: He also echoes Mario Draghi\u2019s point earlier - that any new measures introduced by Greece must be \u2018as good\u2019 as existing The Greek government is briefing tonight that it has achieved some success with the eurogroup, but warned that key issues need to be clarified. Efi Efthimiou of Capital.GR has the details: Here\u2019s a photo of that CDU party meeting, where MPs apparently raised concerns over the Greek deal: I missed this earlier. Greece\u2019s economic reforms include an intriguing hint that they could introduce a basic income for citizens aged tween 50 and 65. That\u2019s an important issue in economics today; with many experts arguing that in a world with less growth and major technological change, governments may have to guarantee BI for all citizens. Tomas Hirst has a good take on Business Insider: BI is, at its core, about a redefinition of the conception that was prevalent at the inception of the modern welfare state that the point of welfare payments were to keep people \u201cfit for work\u201d. That may have been an appropriate moniker for its time, but modern societies have developed different expectations for the quality of life that its citizens should enjoy. Just being fit enough to get into work doesn\u2019t cut it anymore. In the case of Greece it looks like such a scheme would initially be targeted at those nearing pension age in order to prevent them from taking early retirement \u2014 providing them with an income that they would otherwise draw from the state pension fund. Had Syriza failed? Sony Kapoor of the Re-Define thinktank argues that it has not, even though the bailout deal fails to meet all the government\u2019s pre-election promises. He points to three victories. 1) On process: The Eurozone has accepted that it is legitimate for the Greek government to put forward its own proposals as an alternative to reforms prescribed by the creditors. This is more than it appears on the surface, given the very top-down regimented and legalistic approach followed by the Troika so far.... 2) Getting time to develop its own policies.... Being a party that has thus far not been part of the clientelist state, Syriza is more likely to actually deliver on these. It will also focus more on creating an e-government, transparency and on investments essential to help build up productive sectors. Many of the reforms in the programme that has been put forward are sensible and reasonable. It has a few more weeks to put more flesh on the bone and put forward an alternative program to negotiate with the creditors when the \u201cbridge\u201d runs out. 3) ...and time to show Syriza can actually govern: It has won a precious few weeks to demonstrate to its creditors and Eurozone partners that it is a serious government and that Syriza has actually moved beyond the rhetoric of the election into the slow business of taking Greece out of its great depression. What Syriza does in the next few months will be closely watched and scrutinised for intent, as well as competence. In a situation when minister Sch\u00e4uble was once again, as in 2012, ready to push Greece out of the Eurozone and many Greece\u2019s partners had lost trust in the country, this is perhaps the most important victory. Here\u2019s the full piece: The Greek Deal \u2013 A game changer or a mere name changer? The German ruling CDU party have some concerns about the Greek deal, tweets the FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel. They\u2019ll decide on Thursday whether to back it in Friday\u2019s vote in the Bundestag. It would be a major shock if the Bundestag rebelled against Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Schauble on Friday. But by playing hardball now, CDU can help set the tone for the upcoming negotiations with Greece. Greece\u2019s mountain of borrowing will eventually need to be restructured, argues debt campaigners tonight. Sarah-Jayne Clifton, Director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign, says: \u201cThe agreement affords a small but vital pocket of breathing space for Greece to begin to tackle its humanitarian crisis. But the fundamental injustice of the Greek debt situation remains unaddressed. The people of Greece continue to carry the burden of debts caused by reckless, unaccountable banks. Debt crises across the world show that constant debt rescheduling does not work. Greece\u2019s debt is unjust and unsustainable, and debt cancellation is the only fair response. Syriza\u2019s original proposal for a European debt conference needs to be revived.\u201d Back to the Greece bailout deal, and Open Europe\u2019s Pieter Cleppe reckons the Dutch parliament will approve the four-month bailout extension on Thursday. Read the full story of the FTSE 100\u2019s watershed day here: FTSE 100 hits record high of 6959 after Greece\u2019s reform plan is approved Bookmaker Paddy Power is taking bets on when the FTSE 100 will hit 7,500 points. 2015: Evens 2016: 2/1 2017 or later: 5/2 That record high looks a bit less impressive once you adjust for inflation (although don\u2019t forget those dividend payments) Today is a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for City investors, says Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Worldwide Investment. Investors have finally exorcised the ghost of the dot.com bubble which has haunted the market for a decade and a half. Of course, what matters is not the actual level of the market but the value it represents. In 1999 shares were grossly overvalued. Today, thanks to rising profits over the years, UK shares are reasonably priced \u2013 not cheap but by no means expensive.\u201d Although the FTSE 100 is flat over the last 15 years, the value of London\u2019s blue-chip index is actually up by 67% once you include dividends: So is the London stock market overvalued again, as in 1999? Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, argues that it\u2019s not. On a Price-per-earnings basis (the classic ratio of how much shares cost, versus the dividends they pay), the FTSE 100 is actually 50% cheaper now than it was in December 1999. Khalaf explains: The current P/E of the UK\u2019s largest companies currently sits at 16 times earnings. This compares with the dizzy heights of almost 30 times earnings reached in December 1999. The long term average is 15 times earnings.It is tempting to think a new peak in the market is a good time to sell, but investors shouldn\u2019t get spooked by the FTSE 100 reaching new highs. The headline index doesn\u2019t tell us anything about how stock prices relate to company earnings, it is therefore a bit like a clock face without any hands.When you factor in company earnings, the UK stock market looks close to its long term average. In other words the glass is either half empty, or half full, depending on your point of view The highs of December 1999 were followed by the dot-com crash, which saw the FTSE 100 slide for two years. It then recovered, before the credit crunch struck, followed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a global downturn. This graph, from Brewer Dolphin\u2019s Stephen Ford, shows the story: 1999 was truly a dark time.... The FTSE 100 has just closed at a record high, finishing the day at 6949.63 points. That\u2019s a gain of 37 points today, or 0.5%. The intraday record high was set a few minutes earlier, at 6958.89. So, we can finally put the 1999 record highs to bed. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, confirms that Greek relief helped to drive the London stock market higher. With Grexit risks dampened, traders are now looking forward to the launch of the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary stimulus programme. Beauchamp explains: We can stop worrying about Greece for now. With this worry removed it looks like stock markets are free to power ahead, especially as the start of ECB QE looms. Greek relief is only one factor that pushed the FTSE 100 over its previous alltime high this afternoon. The final push came as Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen testified to the Senate. She said it was unlikely that the Fed would raise interest rates in the next few months; the prospect of looser monetary policy cheered investors in Europe and New York. A small rise in the oil price today also helped energy shares, while mining stocks have benefitted from better-than-feared results from Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton. BHP\u2019s shares are up almost 7% today. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has hit a new alltime high, breaking through its dot-com record. Relief that Greece\u2019s bailout crisis has eased today has pushed the Footsie through the 6950 point mark, reached on the final trading day in December 1999. It\u2019s currently hovering around 6954 points, and on track to close at a new record high too (the old record closing is 6930, also set on 30 December \u201899). Greek news agency ANA- MPA has also heard that some Greek government ministers raised objections to the bailout plan at today\u2019s cabinet meeting [as Helena reported earlier]. Enikos.gr has the story: Ministers and members of governing coalition partner Syriza on Tuesday expressed their reservations on the list of reforms the Greek government sent to its lenders during a cabinet meeting, state news agency ANA-MPA reported. The list was approved in the afternoon, according to an announcement by the European Commission. Citing a government source, the agency said Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis raised objections over some measures included in the list, while other ministers asked for more detail. In his letter to Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem, Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis pledged not to roll back privatisations which have been concluded or are in an advanced phase. One of them involves the tender for the sale of power grid operator ADMIE, a subsidiary of public power utility PPC. Lafazanis has objected to the sale. The Greek stock market has surged by 10% today, to close at its highest level in two and a half months. Bank shares gained up to 20%, as bailout relief swept the Athens stock market. The main ATG index finished the day up 85 points at 910. That\u2019s the highest close since December 09 2014, the day after former prime minister secured a two-month bailout extension and called snap presidential elections (triggering last month\u2019s general election). Reports are filtering through that the atmosphere at the Greek government\u2019s cabinet session this morning was very heavy, with enraged ministers openly objecting to the aid extension agreement signed in Brussels last week. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: The energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, who heads Syriza\u2019s militant Left Faction, emerged from the meeting \u201cseeing red\u201d according to reporters who were there. Syriza\u2019s parlimentary group will now hold an emergency meeting at 8pm (6pm GMT) tonight. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has given his approval to Greece\u2019s four-month bailout extension, but also flagged up concerns in a letter to eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Draghi isn\u2019t completely happy with the lack of detail in Greek reform plan. And the ECB (one of Greece\u2019s three creditors) wants convincing that any new economic reforms are at least as good as the ones in the existing bailout agreement. Draghi says: Dear Jeroen, My Staff has reviewed the list of measures which the Greek authorities submitted yesterday evening. Our initial impression is that the document covers a wide range of reform areas and in this sense, it is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review. However, as we expected it was not possible for the authorities to elaborate on concrete proposals and commitments that can be assessed by the institutions in respect to growth, public finances and financial stability. Given the very limited time available, this is understandable. I assume that it is clear that the basis for concluding the current review, and also for any future arrangements, will be the existing commitments in the current Memorandum of Understanding and the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). In this context we note that the commitments outlined by the authorities differ from existing programme commitments in a number of areas. In such cases, we will have to assess during the review whether measures which are not accepted by the authorities are replaced with measures of equal or better quality in terms of achieving the objectives of the programme. I would also again urge the Greek authorities to act swiftly to stabilise the payment culture and refrain from any unilateral action to the contrary. With best regards, [signed] Mario Draghi Back in Athens, the government is trying to calm fears that it has caved into its lenders. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: The government has now distributed a six-page \u201cnon-paper\u201d, outlining the points in the \u201cThessaloniki programme\u201d [Tsipras\u2019s anti-austerity manifesto] which are included in the list of reforms. That\u2019s aimed at the growing number of critics within his own party. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras outlined his radical left Syriza party\u2019s economic policies in Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s northern capital, last September - pledging to enact them when he assumed office. The paper points out that the new government will begin by alleviating \u201cthe needs that have emerged with the recent rise of total poverty\u201d saying, where needed, it will provide food, shelter, health services and basic energy. The hand-outs will be given in such a way that they help reform the public administration and clamp down on bureaucracy and corruption. Efforts to alleviate the humanitarian crisis will, it insists, not have a negative impact on the fiscal budget. The note continues with a run-down of how the anti-austerity leftist-led coalition will lure foreign investment (by pressing ahead with privatisations), kickstart employment opportunities, improve the business environment, tax collecting revenues and target oil smuggling and other forms of tax evasion by the country\u2019s wealthy elite. One finance ministry source confided: \u201cIt\u2019s really nobody else\u2019s business how we deal with our finances internally as long as we are keeping balanced budgets.\u201d Christine Lagarde ends her letter with a serious warning -- as things stand, the policy proposals outlined by Greece are not enough to ensure a successful review of its IMF programme (which runs until 2016) The IMF\u2019s concerns probably won\u2019t stop eurozone parliaments approving Greece\u2019s four-month bailout extension, but it\u2019s another sign that the next few months will be tricky for Greece. Hold the euphoria. The International Monetary Fund has written to the eurogroup, criticising elements of the Greek government\u2019s reform plans. Christine Lagarde says that: Whilst the authorities list is comprehensive, it is not very specific, which is perhaps to be expected considered the government is new in office. In the letter, just released, Lagarde welcomes signs of \u201cstronger resolve\u201d on tax evasion and corruption, but then warns: We note in particular that there are neither clear commitments to design and implement the envisaged comprehensive pension and VAT policy reforms nor unequivocal undertakings to continue already-agreed policies for opening up closed sectors, for administrative reforms, for privatisation, and for labour market reforms. Those undertakings are essential to Greece\u2019s ability to meet the basic objectives of its programme agreed with the IMF, Lagarde adds. The European Parliament has confirmed that finance ministers has approved extending Greece\u2019s bailout programme by four months. But, in a brief statement, the ministers also want Athens to flesh out its reform measures. It says: The Eurogroup today discussed the first list of reform measures presented by the Greek authorities, based on the current arrangement, which will be further specified and then agreed with the institutions at the latest by the end of April. The institutions [IMF/ECB/EU] provided us with their first view that they consider this list of measures to be sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review. We therefore agreed to proceed with the national procedures with a view to reaching the final decision on the extension by up to four months of the current Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement. We call on the Greek authorities to further develop and broaden the list of reform measures, based on the current arrangement, in close coordination with the institutions in order to allow for a speedy and successful conclusion of the review. Sky\u2019s Ed Conway says that the eurogroup wants Greece to make some changes to its reform programme, and we might get the details later... In the meantime, though, Greece\u2019s immediate funding needs should be covered. IT\u2019S OFFICIAL. The eurozone finance ministers have approved Greece\u2019s four-month bailout extension, after a one-hour conference call in which they scrutinised Athens\u2019 reform programme. Valdis Dombrovskis, commissioner for the euro, tweets the news: Now the ball is passed to national parliaments, who must give their own approval. Germany is the key vote -- on Friday. Reuters has also had the news confirmed by a Greek finance minister: The Slovakian finance minister\u2019s media team has tweeted that the Greek bailout deal \u201cholds\u201d. They add that the eurozone is eager to see firm details on Athens\u2019 plans in the weeks ahead. Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr should have taken part on the eurogroup conference call, of course, so he should know the result. Crisis delayed, but perhaps not denied? Newsflash from Bloomberg, saying the eurozone finance ministers have approved Greece\u2019s reform package. I can\u2019t see anything official yet, though..... Our Europe editor predicts a lively few months ahead.... OECD chief Angel Gurria spoke about the Greek crisis in London today: A brief recap. Eurozone finance ministers are getting ready to hold a eurogroup conference call to decide whether to accept a list of economic reforms proposed by the Greek government last night. If they give the green light, Greece will be on the brink of securing a four-month bailout extension. The European Commission has given its backing to the reforms. In a letter to the eurogroup, just released, the EC says the list is \u201csufficiently comprehensive\u201d to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review, adding: We are encouraged by the commitment to combat tax evasion and corruption, inter alia through efforts to modernise tax and custom administrations, as well as to pursue reforms to modernise the public administration. The Commission also notes the commitments in the area of statistics and considers it of vital importance that the institutional and operational independence of ELSTAT and its senior management be respected at all times. More here: Letter by Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis and Commissioner Pierre Moscovici to the President of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, on the Greek government\u2019s reform proposals The full list of Greek reforms arrived in Brussels around midnight last night, and was published by Reuters this morning. It shows that Athens is committing to tax reforms, reforming public spending and the labour markets, helping the poorest, and driving growth. But Greece has also fallen into line; pledging that not to unwind state privatisations, to stick to budget targets while fighting the humanitarian crisis, and to consult with its partners before raising the minimum wage. Analysts predict that Greece has made enough concessions to win approval from Brussels... ....which means it may face a battle to get the reforms through the Athens parliament. Prime minister Tsipras has already met with one vocal crisis of austerity - composer Mikis Theodorakis. And he\u2019s received a rare compliment from one of Greece\u2019s bishops. National governments still need to give their approval. Germany\u2019s finance minister has already urged the Bundestag to give its support, at a vote on Friday. Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem has insisted that Greece will not leave the eurozone, in an appearance before MEPs this morning. In the markets, Greek bonds and stocks have rallied, on relief that a deal was reached on Friday night (it was closed yesterday). Newsflash from Brussels.... the Commission has digested the long list of reforms emailed by Greece last night (see earlier post) and concluded that they are \u201csufficiently comprehensive\u201d to pass muster. However, it wants to see these commitments turned into actual actions. EU COMMISSION LETTER TO EUROGROUP SAYS GREEK LETTER \u201cSUFFICIENTLY COMPREHENSIVE TO BE VALID STARTING POINT FOR A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF REVIEW\u201d COMMISSION LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION TO ELABORATE WHAT ARE AT THE MOMENT STILL GENERAL COMMITMENTS AND TRANSFORM THESE INTO CLEAR POLICY ACTIONS\u201d Here\u2019s your daily reminder of the debt repayments Greece faces this year: Life may get harder for the new Greek government when it tries to get its reform plans into law. Joan Hoey, senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts tough battles in the Athens parliament, which could even bring down Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government. She says: \u201cSyriza is already facing criticism and dissent within its own ranks and may also encounter opposition from its coalition partner, the anti-bailout Independent Greeks. We expect implementation difficulties, given previous strong commitments made by Syriza to reverse previous reforms, stop privatisation, restore the minimum wage, etc, commitments which it has now had to drop. The issues on which the previous government fell\u2014austerity and reform implementation\u2014will not go away. The prospect is therefore for continued political instability in Greece and we forecast that the coalition will not last longer than 12\u201318 months. We continue to assign a 40% risk to a Grexit\u201d. That last comment won\u2019t please Jeroen Dijsselbloem, given his promise that Greece\u2019s future in the eurozone isn\u2019t under debate.... Greece\u2019s deputy minister in charge of administrative reform has warned that the newly-installed government is ready for a fight \u2013 dispelling accusations that the Syriza-led administration is about to conduct a major u-turn. Helena Smith reports from Athens: \u201cNegotiations will continue, they are not going to stop here,\u201d said Giorgos Katrougalos, a former MEP with the radical left party. The government, he said, was bracing for a reaction, that might not be all good, following submission of its priority reforms. \u201cOf course we are ready for a clash,\u201d said the politician who announced at the weekend that he would give up his post if \u201ccertain red lines\u201d weren\u2019t respected. Quarrelling was part of the negotiation process, said Katrougalos, describing the deal Athens had managed to strike as \u201cthe best possible\u201d in that it gave the debt-stricken` country the breathing space to properly prepare a better package of reforms to transform Greece. It\u2019s early days, yet, but there is mounting consensus among politicians and analysts that the list of reforms strikes a harmonious balance in appeasing both domestic and European audiences. \u201cThe big question is will they be able to deliver,\u201d said Dr Eleni Panagiotarea, senior research fellow at Athens\u2019 leading think tank Eliamep. \u201cThat is going to be vital to restoring the trust and credibility deficit Greece has suffered.\u201d But this morning even the church (no friend of the atheist Syriza) has come out batting for the Greek premier Alexis Tsipras and Yanis Varoufakis, his finance minister. Bishop Anthimos of Thessaloniki, among the country\u2019s most hardline clerics, heaped praise on the two politicians saying, firstly, both have a: \u201chigh intellectual calibre, secondly they believe in what they are trying to achieve, and thirdly they have the persistence and clarity to continually change what they want so that they arrive at a good result \u2026 that is, they are two men who are fighting and struggling. We have to recognise that.\u201d Christmas has come early for chancellor George Osborne. The head of the OECD is congratulating him on the economic recovery, and urging the UK to stick with the current plan. It\u2019s all a bit sickly for some... Over in London, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is presenting a report on the UK economy. And it\u2019s warning that Britain must fix its productivity problem to secure future economic growth and improve living standards. The OECD also lowered its forecast for UK growth this year by a smidgen, from 2.7% to 2.6%; still faster than most rivals. Angel Gurria, head of the OECD, says the UK economy is performing rather well: One man\u2019s sensible compromise is another man\u2019s shameful capitulation, of course. Any deal that is waved through by the eurogroup is likely to fuel criticism from those in Greece who expected Syriza to defy their creditors. The Greek stock market is still soaring, up over 7% today. National Bank of Greece, one of its largest lenders, is up almost 14% followed by Alpha Bank (+13%), and Piraeus Bank (+11%). However.... Dromeas Office Furniture Industry tumbled by 8.5% after the reform plans were released. They supply a lot of equipment to the government, so could be hit by the plan to find \u201ccost saving measures through a thorough spending review of every Ministry\u201d. You might find this pdf of Greece\u2019s reform proposals a little easier to read (it\u2019s the same as the version posted earlier). Greece\u2019s reforms plan looks like a sensible compromise between the Greek government\u2019s promises and the demands of its creditors, commentators say. Greek journalist Nick Malkoutzis reckons the pledge to \u2018modernise\u2019 pensions could cause ructions: Eurocrisis expert Yanni Kouts is confident eurozone ministers will give it the green light: Newnight\u2019s Duncan Weldon says the deal looks like a sensible compromise. And Dan Davies of Frontline Analysts flags up that Greece\u2019s government has given ground in some key areas, including labour reform: Newsflash: eurozone finance ministers will hold a conference call at 2pm Brussels time (1pm GMT or 3pm EET) to discuss Greece\u2019s plan. Reuters has now published the full text of Greece\u2019s reforms. At first glance it is broadly as expected -- lot of commitments to reform the tax base, fight corruption, and improve Greece\u2019s public sector. There are also several clear concessions to its creditors. Athens is pledging not to reverse the state asset sales that are already underway. And it says it will aim to raise minimum wages in a manner that \u201csafeguards competiveness and employment prospects\u201d, and in consultation with its partners. The government is also promising help for families and businesses who simply cannot pay their debt, while clamping down hard on \u201cstrategic defaulters\u201d. It\u2019s rather long, but I\u2019ve pasted it in full here I. Fiscal structural policies Tax policies \u2013 Greece commits to: \u007f Reform VAT policy, administration and enforcement. Robust efforts will be made to improve collection and fight evasion making full use of electronic means and other technological innovations. VAT policy will be rationalised in relation to rates that will be streamlined in a manner that maximises actual revenues without a negative impact on social justice, and with a view to limiting exemptions while eliminating unreasonable discounts. \u007f Modify the taxation of collective investment and income tax expenditures which will be integrated in the income tax code. \u007f Broaden definition of tax fraud and evasion while disbanding tax immunity. \u007f Modernising the income tax code and eliminating from it tax code exemptions and replacing them, when necessary, with social justice enhancing measures. \u007f Resolutely enforce and improve legislation on transfer pricing. \u007f Work toward creating a new culture of tax compliance to ensure that all sections of society, and especially the well-off, contribute fairly to the financing of public policies. In this context, establish with the assistance of European and international partners, a wealth database that assists the tax authorities in gauging the veracity of previous income tax returns. Public Finance Management Greece will: \u007f Adopt amendments to the Organic Budget Law and take steps to improve public finance management. Budget implementation will be improved and clarified as will control and reporting responsibilities. Payment procedures will be modernised and accelerated while providing a higher degree of financial and budgetary flexibility and accountability for independent and/or regulatory entities. \u007f Devise and implement a strategy on the clearance of arrears, tax refunds and pension claims. \u007f Turn the already established (though hitherto dormant) Fiscal Council into a fully operational entity. Revenue administration Greece will modernise the tax and custom administrations benefiting from available technical assistance. To this end Greece will: \u007f Enhance the openness, transparency and international reach of the process by which the General Secretary of the General Secretariat of Public Revenues is appointed, monitored in terms of performance, and replaced. \u007f Strengthen the independence of the General Secretariat of Public Revenues (GSPR), if necessary through further legislation, from all sorts of interference (political or otherwise) while guaranteeing full accountability and transparency of its operations. To this end, the government and the GSPR will make full use of available technical assistance. \u007f Staff adequately, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the GSPR and in particular the high wealth and large debtors units of the revenue administration and ensure that it has strong investigative/prosecution powers, and resources building on SDOE\u2019s capacities, so as to target effectively tax fraud by, and tax arrears of, high income social groups. Consider the merits of integrating SDOE into GSPR. \u007f Augment inspections, risk-based audits, and collection capacities while seeking to integrate the functions of revenue and social security collection across the general government. Public spending \u2013 The Greek authorities will: \u007f Review and control spending in every area of government spending (e.g. education, defence, transport, local government, social benefits) \u007f Work toward drastically improving the efficiency of central and local government administered departments and units by targeting budgetary processes, management restructuring, and reallocation of poorly deployed resources. \u007f Identify cost saving measures through a thorough spending review of every Ministry and rationalisation of non-salary and non-pension expenditures which, at present, account for an astounding 56% of total public expenditure. \u007f Implement legislation (currently in draft form at the General Accounts Office \u2013 GAO) to review non-wage benefits expenditure across the public sector. \u007f Validate benefits through cross checks within the relevant authorities and registries (e.g. Tax Number Registry, AMKA registry) that will help identify non-eligible beneficiaries. \u007f Control health expenditure and improve the provision and quality of medical services, while granting universal access. In this context, the government intends to table specific proposals in collaboration with European and international institutions, including the OECD. Social security reform \u2013 Greece is committed to continue modernising the pension system. The authorities will: \u007f Continue to work on administrative measures to unify and streamline pension policies and eliminate loopholes and incentives that give rise to an excessive rate of early retirements throughout the economy and, more specifically, in the banking and public sectors. \u007f Consolidate pension funds to achieve savings. \u007f Phase out charges on behalf of \u2018third parties\u2019 (nuisance charges) in a fiscally neutral manner. \u007f Establish a closer link between pension contributions and income, streamline benefits, strengthen incentives to declare paid work, and provide targeted assistance to employees between 50 and 65, including through a Guaranteed Basic Income scheme, so as to eliminate the social and political pressure for early retirement which over-burdens the pension funds. Public administration &amp; corruption \u2013 Greece wants a modern public administration. It will: \u007f Turn the fight against corruption into a national priority and operationalize fully the National Plan Against Corruption. \u007f Target fuel and tobacco products\u2019 smuggling, monitor prices of imported goods (to prevent revenue losses during the importation process), and tackle money laundering. The government intends immediately to set itself ambitious revenue targets, in these areas, to be pursued under the coordination of the newly established position of Minister of State. \u007f Reduce (a) the number of Ministries (from 16 to 10), (b) the number of \u2018special advisors\u2019 in general government; and (c) fringe benefits of ministers, Members of Parliament and top officials (e.g. cars, travel expenses, allowances) \u007f Tighten the legislation concerning the funding of political parties and include maximum levels of borrowing from financial and other institutions. \u007f Activate immediately the current (though dormant) legislation that regulates the revenues of media (press and electronic), ensuring (through appropriately designed auctions) that they pay the state market prices for frequencies used, and prohibits the continued operation of permanently loss-making media outlets (without a transparent process of recapitalisation) \u007f Establish a transparent, electronic, real time institutional framework for public tenders/procurement \u2013 re-establishing DIAVGEIA (a side-lined online public registry of activities relating to public procurement) \u007f Reform the public sector wage grid with a view to decompressing the wage distribution through productivity gains and appropriate recruitment policies without reducing the current wage floors but safeguarding that the public sector\u2019s wage bill will not increase \u007f Rationalise non-wage benefits, to reduce overall expenditure, without imperilling the functioning of the public sector and in accordance with EU good practices \u007f Promote measures to: improve recruitment mechanisms, encourage merit-based managerial appointments, base staff appraisals on genuine evaluation, and establish fair processes for maximising mobility of human and other resources within the public sector II. Financial stability Instalment Schemes. Greece commits to: Improve swiftly, in agreement with the institutions, the legislation for repayments of tax and social security arrears \u007f Calibrate instalment schemes in a manner that helps discriminate efficiently between: (a) strategic default/non-payment and (b) inability to pay; targeting case (a) individuals/firms by means of civil and criminal procedures (especially amongst high income groups) while offering case (b) individuals/firms repayment terms in a manner that enables potentially solvent enterprises to survive, averts free-riding, annuls moral hazard, and reinforces social responsibility as well as a proper re-payment culture. \u007f De-criminalise lower income debtors with small liabilities \u007f Step up enforcement methods and procedures, including the legal framework for collecting unpaid taxes and effectively implement collection tools Banking and Non-Performing loans. Greece is committed to: \u007f Banks that are run on sound commercial/banking principles \u007f Utilise fully the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund and ensure, in collaboration with the SSM, the ECB and the European Commission, that it plays well its key role of securing the banking sector\u2019s stability and its lending on commercial basis while complying with EU competition rules. \u007f Dealing with non-performing loans in a manner that considers fully the banks\u2019 capitalisation (taking into account the adopted Code of Conduct for Banks), the functioning of the judiciary system, the state of the real estate market, social justice issues, and any adverse impact on the government\u2019s fiscal position. \u007f Collaborating with the banks\u2019 management and the institutions to avoid, in the forthcoming period, auctions of the main residence of households below a certain income threshold, while punishing strategic defaulters, with a view to: (a) maintaining society\u2019s support for the government\u2019s broad reform program, (b) preventing a further fall in real estate asset prices (that would have an adverse effect on the banks\u2019 own portfolio), (c) minimising the fiscal impact of greater homelessness, and (d) promoting a strong payment culture. Measures will be taken to support the most vulnerable households who are unable to service their loans \u007f Align the out-of-court workout law with the instalment schemes after their amendment, to limit risks to public finances and the payment culture, while facilitating private debt restructuring. \u007f Modernise bankruptcy law and address the backlog of cases III. Policies to promote growth Privatisation and public asset management: To attract investment in key sectors and utilise the state\u2019s assets efficiently, the Greek authorities will: \u007f Commit not to roll back privatisations that have been completed. Where the tender process has been launched the government will respect the process, according to the law. \u007f Safeguard the provision of basic public goods and services by privatised firms/industries in line with national policy goals and in compliance with EU legislation. \u007f Review privatisations that have not yet been launched, with a view to improving the terms so as to maximise the state\u2019s long term benefits, generate revenues, enhance competition in the local economies, promote national economic recovery, and stimulate long term growth prospects. \u007f Adopt, henceforth, an approach whereby each new case will be examined separately and on its merits, with an emphasis on long leases, joint ventures (private-public collaboration) and contracts that maximise not only government revenues but also prospective levels of private investment. \u007f Unify (HRDAF) with various public asset management agencies (which are currently scattered across the public sector) with a view to developing state assets and enhancing their value through microeconomic and property rights\u2019 reforms. Labor market reforms Greece commits to: \u007f Achieve EU best practice across the range of labour market legislation through a process of consultation with the social partners while benefitting from the expertise and existing input of the ILO, the OECD and the available technical assistance. \u007f Expand and develop the existing scheme that provides temporary employment for the unemployed, in agreement with partners and when fiscal space permits and improve the active labour market policy programmes with the aim to updating the skills of the long term unemployed. \u007f Phasing in a new \u2018smart\u2019 approach to collective wage bargaining that balances the needs for flexibility with fairness. This includes the ambition to streamline and over time raise minimum wages in a manner that safeguards competiveness and employment prospects. The scope and timing of changes to the minimum wage will be made in consultation with social partners and the European and international institutions, including the ILO, and take full account of advice from a new independent body on whether changes in wages are in line with productivity developments and competitiveness. Product market reforms and a better business environment As part of a new reform agenda, Greece remains committed to: \u007f Removing barriers to competition based on input from the OECD. \u007f Strengthen the Hellenic Competition Commission. \u007f Introduce actions to reduce the burdens of administrative burden of bureaucracy in line with the OECD\u2019s input, including legislation that bans public sector units from requesting (from citizens and business) documents certifying information that the state already possesses (within the same or some other unit). \u007f Better land use management, including policies related to spatial planning, land use, and the finalisation of a proper Land Registry \u007f Pursue efforts to lift disproportionate and unjustified restrictions in regulated professions as part of the overall strategy to tackle vested interests. \u007f Align gas and electricity market regulation with EU good practices and legislation Reform of the judicial system \u2013 The Greek government will: \u007f Improve the organisation of courts through greater specialisation and, in this context, adopt a new Code of Civil Procedure. \u007f Promote the digitisation of legal codes and the electronic submission system, and governance, of the judicial system. Statistics \u2013 The Greek government reaffirms its readiness to: \u007f Honour fully the Commitment on Confidence in Statistics, and in particular the institutional independence of ELSTAT, ensuring that ELSTAT has the necessary resources to implement its work programme. \u007f Guarantee the transparency and propriety of the process of appointment of the ELSTAT President in September 2015, in cooperation with EUROSTAT. IV. Humanitarian Crisis \u2013 The Greek government affirms its plan to: \u007f Address needs arising from the recent rise in absolute poverty (inadequate access to nourishment, shelter, health services and basic energy provision) by means of highly targeted non-pecuniary measures (e.g. food stamps). \u007f Do so in a manner that is helpful to the reforming of public administration and the fight against bureaucracy/corruption (e.g. the issuance of a Citizen Smart Card that can be used as an ID card, in the Health System, as well as for gaining access to the food stamp program etc.). \u007f Evaluate the pilot Minimum Guaranteed Income scheme with a view to extending it nationwide. \u007f Ensure that its fight against the humanitarian crisis has no negative fiscal effect. Over in Athens, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has just ended a meeting with one of the country\u2019s leading anti-austerity voices, the celebrated composer Mikis Theodorakis. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports that the meeting was organized after the academy award-winning composer penned a lacerating letter in which Theodorakis called for Tsipras\u2019 radical-left Syriza party \u201cto find the strength, even now, to say OXI [NO] to [German finance minister Wolfgang] Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s \u2018NEIN.\u2019 Helena writes: Tsipras, it has emerged, telephoned the composer to congratulate him on the statement shortly after its release! The meeting, which took place before a cabinet meeting at 12pm local time (10am), is aimed at nixing the mounting dissent within Syriza\u2019s ranks over what is perceived to be the government\u2019s climbdown in Brussels last week. The dissatisfaction will be the focus of debate (along with the reform package the finance ministry assembled yesterday) at the cabinet meeting. Costas Lapavitsas, the noted London University economics professor who is now a Syriza MP (and belongs to the party\u2019s hard left faction) has just told STAR TV that Syriza would have \u201cno reason to exist\u201d in government if it does not enforce its pre-election pledges. The discontent is such that 50 members of the party\u2019s Central Committee this morning demanded an emergency meeting of the body to discuss what was described as a \u201ccritical political juncture.\u201d The dissenters want to be \u201cproperly informed\u201d about the new aid extension deal Greece has signed up to. Analyst Hugo Dixon of Breaking Views has given the thumbs-up to Greece\u2019s plan (see last post) Greece\u2019s reforms list includes a pledge not to roll back any state asset privatisations, according to Reuters, which has seen a copy this morning. It also includes a pledge that the efforts to address Greece\u2019s humanitarian crisis will not \u201churt\u201d its budgets (ie, push them back into deficit). And Athens is also offering to consult over plans to raise the minimum wage, and suggesting that wage rises for lower-paid workers would be offset with cuts for wealthier workers. Reuters Mattias Sobolewski writes: The list also includes pledges to reform tax policy, review and control spending in \u201cevery area\u201d of government spending. It also commits to consolidating pension funds to achieve savings and eliminate loopholes and incentives for early retirement - in an apparent effort to find a compromise between the government\u2019s stated objective to avoid any further pension cuts as previously demanded by EU and IMF inspectors. Athens also said it would reform the public sector wage grid in a way that would not reduce wages further but would ensure that the overall public wage bill does not rise. It also said it would phase in collective wage bargaining with a view to raising the minimum wage over time, but that any such rise would be made in consultation with European and other partners. This may well satisfy the eurogroup. My webfeed of Dijsselbloem\u2019s appearance has now crashed. But apparently the eurogroup chief is explaining that last month\u2019s Greek general election can\u2019t change the way the whole eurozone operates. The Telegraph\u2019s Bruno Waterfield has the details: Dijsselbloem looks in cheery mood this morning: It\u2019s possible that Greece could get some form of debt relief in future, once it has met all the targets in its existing programme, Dijsselbloem says. Ouch! Jeroen Dijsselbloem tells MEPs that only one country held a meeting to discuss the dangers of Greece leaving the eurozone -- and that was Britain. That\u2019s a reference to the emergency meeting chaired by David Cameron two weeks ago, as the Greek bailout crisis escalated. Maybe the UK government would argue that their pressure helped get the two sides together? The eurozone will stick together, Dijsselbloem insists. Grexit is not an option. Disappointing! Jeroen Dijsselbloem has ducked the opportunity to to give his opinion of Greece\u2019s list of reforms ahead of this afternoon\u2019s conference call. He says the Athens government is very serious about its reform plans. However, the plan submitted last night is \u201cjust a first step\u201d in a long process. It will take time to get into the details. Apparently the Greek proposals arrived in Jeroen Dijsselbloem\u2019s inbox at 11.15pm last night -- or shortly after midnight in Athens. Ireland remains a poster boy for the eurozone. Dijsselbloem is telling MEPs that the country is making \u201cstrong progress on all fronts\u201d, with Irish employment growing impressively. Jeroen Dijsselbleom has confirmed that the Greek reforms plan arrived \u201cjust in time\u201d. Heads-up. Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem is testifying to the European Parliament\u2019s Economic and Monetary affairs committee now. He\u2019s expected to discuss the Greek bailout. There\u2019s a livefeed here. Newsflash from Berlin: the German parliament will vote on Greece\u2019s bailout extension on Friday. The Greek debt crisis now has its own song. Will Butler of Canadian indie rock group Arcade Fire is penning new tunes this week, inspired by something he\u2019s read in the Guardian each day. His first, called Clean Monday, is about Greece - having read yesterday\u2019s liveblog (!) Will, who says he\u2019s \u2018rooting\u2019 for Greece\u2019s new government, writes: I was reading the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the forthcoming Greek proposals of how they\u2019re going to pay off their debts, when a little blurb popped up explaining that the Greek markets were closed today because it was \u201cClean Monday\u201d \u2013 the Greek Orthodox equivalent of Ash Wednesday. It was an amazing/hilarious (well, maybe mildly amusing) coincidence to me that the Greek ministers were scrambling and figuring out how to avoid strict austerity on the day that Lent starts. Clean Monday is online here. Well worth a listen \u2013 Will\u2019s twitter fans love it. The Greek stock market is soaring, up 7.2% in early trading. The ATG index has hit its highest level since early December 2014, with bank shares surging by around 14%. This is Athens\u2019 investors first chance to react to Friday night\u2019s deal, as the market was closed yesterday for the \u201cClean Monday\u2019 holiday. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s letter to the Bundestag also shows that Germany is determined that Greece sticks to the bailout agreement agreed in 2012, Ian Traynor adds. It says that \u201cthe aim of the extension is the orderly conclusion of the programme review.\u201d La troika est morte, vive la troika... Greek bonds are strengthening in value this morning, as markets welcome the news that its reform plans have been submitted, and may well be approved. This has pushed down the yield (effectively the interest rate) on Greek debts this morning, showing traders think the risk of default has fallen. Here\u2019s the chart of Greece\u2019s three-year bond yield, which hit dangerously high levels following January\u2019s general election. The yield on Greece\u2019s 10-year debts has fallen too, from 10.1% to 9.5%. Encouraging news for Athens. The eurozone\u2019s chief hawk, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has asked German MPs to back Greece\u2019s bailout extension. The Handelsblatt newspaper has a copy of a four-page letter sent by Germany\u2019s finance minister to the speaker of the Bundestag, asking for the chamber\u2019s support for the four-month extension. The letter says that: \u201cThe Federal government advocates the proposed extension, against the background of Greece\u2019s acknowledgment of its commitments and the agreement in the eurogroup.\u201d But time is tight, as our Europe editor Ian Traynor explains: The Bundestag has to support last Friday\u2019s eurogroup pact with Greece, as do a few other eurozone parliaments... though it might be argued that some parliaments are bigger than others. If all goes well today, the Bundestag could back the package on Friday, a day before what is now called the \u2018current arrangements\u2019 expire. A Commission source has told Reuters that Greece\u2019s list of reforms is \u201csufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review,\u201d adding: \u201cWe are notably encouraged by the strong commitment to combat tax evasion and corruption.\u201d European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva has confirmed that Greece got its menu of reforms in before the midnight deadline. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek bailout negotiations and other key events across the world economy, the financial markets and business. We start with some breaking news... Greece has taken a big step towards finalising its four-month bailout extension by submitting its list of planned economic reforms to Brussels. After yesterday\u2019s drafting and redrafting, the Athens government has sent a final list of measures to its creditors. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, has just tweeted that the list reached Brussels before the deadline of midnight Monday/Tuesday. It will now be assessed by eurozone finance ministers on a conference call this afternoon. If they approve it, then Greece\u2019s immediate funding needs should be covered until early summer. If they don\u2019t, then last Friday\u2019s deal will come under immediate strain. As we covered yesterday, the proposal is expected to outline plans to raise billions of euros by tackling tax evasion, corruption, and smuggling. It may also provide new protection for taxpayers who face fines for unpaid tax, home owners who risk defaulting on their mortgages, and support for the poorest. Prime minister Alexex Tsipras\u2019s government is trying to tread a tricky line, between satisfying the demands of the eurozone and meeting his pre-election pledges. The big question, though, is whether today\u2019s proposals are detailed enough to satisfy finance ministers. Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem may give an early clue, when he appears before the European Parliament\u2019s Economic and Monetary Affairs committee from 9am GMT (10am local time). In other news, three of the world\u2019s most powerful central bankers will be appearing today. Bank of England governor Mark Carney testifies to the UK\u2019s Treasury committee from 10am GMT. ECB president Mario Draghi speaks in Frankfurt at 2pm GMT. And Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen testifies to the Senate banking committee from 3pm GMT. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day as usual...",

Our initial impression is that the document covers a wide range of reform areas and in this sense, it is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review. However, as we expected it was not possible for the authorities to elaborate on concrete proposals and commitments that can be assessed by the institutions in respect to growth, public finances and financial stability. Given the very limited time available, this is understandable. </p> <p>I assume that it is clear that the basis for concluding the current review, and also for any future arrangements, will be the existing commitments in the current Memorandum of Understanding and the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). In this context we note that the commitments outlined by the authorities differ from existing programme commitments in a number of areas. In such cases, we will have to assess during the review whether measures which are not accepted by the authorities are replaced with measures of equal or better quality in terms of achieving the objectives of the programme. </p> <p>I would also again urge the Greek authorities to act swiftly to stabilise the payment culture and refrain from any unilateral action to the contrary.</p> <p>With best regards,</p> <p>[signed] Mario Draghi </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-02-24T15:14:28.749Z\">at 3.14pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54ec9128e4b0432395dcb6f2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-02-24T15:00:06.341Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Damage limitation exercise underway in Greece</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back in Athens, the government is trying to calm fears that it has caved into its lenders.</strong></p> <h2>Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: </h2> <p>The government has now distributed a six-page \u201cnon-paper\u201d, outlining the points in the \u201cThessaloniki programme\u201d [<a href=\"http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=631486\">Tsipras\u2019s anti-austerity manifesto</a>] which are included in the list of reforms.

Fiscal structural policies </h2> <p><strong>Tax policies </strong>\u2013 Greece commits to: \u007f </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Reform VAT policy, administration and enforcement. Robust efforts will be made to improve collection and fight evasion making full use of electronic means and other technological innovations. VAT policy will be rationalised in relation to rates that will be streamlined in a manner that maximises actual revenues without a negative impact on social justice, and with a view to limiting exemptions while eliminating unreasonable discounts.</p> <p>\u007f Modify the taxation of collective investment and income tax expenditures which will be integrated in the income tax code.</p> <p>\u007f Broaden definition of tax fraud and evasion while disbanding tax immunity.</p> <p>\u007f Modernising the income tax code and eliminating from it tax code exemptions and replacing them, when necessary, with social justice enhancing measures.</p> <p>\u007f Resolutely enforce and improve legislation on transfer pricing.</p> <p>\u007f Work toward creating a new culture of tax compliance to ensure that all sections of society, and especially the well-off, contribute fairly to the financing of public policies. In this context, establish with the assistance of European and international partners, a wealth database that assists the tax authorities in gauging the veracity of previous income tax returns.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Public Finance Management</strong></p> <p>Greece will: \u007f </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Adopt amendments to the Organic Budget Law and take steps to improve public finance management. Budget implementation will be improved and clarified as will control and reporting responsibilities. Payment procedures will be modernised and accelerated while providing a higher degree of financial and budgetary flexibility and accountability for independent and/or regulatory entities.</p> <p>\u007f Devise and implement a strategy on the clearance of arrears, tax refunds and pension claims.</p> <p>\u007f Turn the already established (though hitherto dormant) Fiscal Council into a fully operational entity.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Revenue administration </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Greece will modernise the tax and custom administrations benefiting from available technical assistance. To this end Greece will: \u007f Enhance the openness, transparency and international reach of the process by which the General Secretary of the General Secretariat of Public Revenues is appointed, monitored in terms of performance, and replaced.</p> <p>\u007f Strengthen the independence of the General Secretariat of Public Revenues (GSPR), if necessary through further legislation, from all sorts of interference (political or otherwise) while guaranteeing full accountability and transparency of its operations. To this end, the government and the GSPR will make full use of available technical assistance.</p> <p>\u007f Staff adequately, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the GSPR and in particular the high wealth and large debtors units of the revenue administration and ensure that it has strong investigative/prosecution powers, and resources building on SDOE\u2019s capacities, so as to target effectively tax fraud by, and tax arrears of, high income social groups. Consider the merits of integrating SDOE into GSPR.</p> <p>\u007f Augment inspections, risk-based audits, and collection capacities while seeking to integrate the functions of revenue and social security collection across the general government.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Public spending \u2013 </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Greek authorities will: \u007f Review and control spending in every area of government spending (e.g. education, defence, transport, local government, social benefits)</p> <p>\u007f Work toward drastically improving the efficiency of central and local government administered departments and units by targeting budgetary processes, management restructuring, and reallocation of poorly deployed resources.</p> <p>\u007f Identify cost saving measures through a thorough spending review of every Ministry and rationalisation of non-salary and non-pension expenditures which, at present, account for an astounding 56% of total public expenditure.</p> <p>\u007f Implement legislation (currently in draft form at the General Accounts Office \u2013 GAO) to review non-wage benefits expenditure across the public sector.</p> <p>\u007f Validate benefits through cross checks within the relevant authorities and registries (e.g. Tax Number Registry, AMKA registry) that will help identify non-eligible beneficiaries.</p> <p>\u007f Control health expenditure and improve the provision and quality of medical services, while granting universal access. In this context, the government intends to table specific proposals in collaboration with European and international institutions, including the OECD.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Social security reform</strong> \u2013 </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Greece is committed to continue modernising the pension system. The authorities will: \u007f Continue to work on administrative measures to unify and streamline pension policies and eliminate loopholes and incentives that give rise to an excessive rate of early retirements throughout the economy and, more specifically, in the banking and public sectors.</p> <p>\u007f Consolidate pension funds to achieve savings.</p> <p>\u007f Phase out charges on behalf of \u2018third parties\u2019 (nuisance charges) in a fiscally neutral manner.</p> <p>\u007f Establish a closer link between pension contributions and income, streamline benefits, strengthen incentives to declare paid work, and provide targeted assistance to employees between 50 and 65, including through a Guaranteed Basic Income scheme, so as to eliminate the social and political pressure for early retirement which over-burdens the pension funds.</p> <p>Public administration &amp; corruption \u2013 Greece wants a modern public administration. It will: \u007f Turn the fight against corruption into a national priority and operationalize fully the National Plan Against Corruption.</p> <p>\u007f Target fuel and tobacco products\u2019 smuggling, monitor prices of imported goods (to prevent revenue losses during the importation process), and tackle money laundering. The government intends immediately to set itself ambitious revenue targets, in these areas, to be pursued under the coordination of the newly established position of Minister of State.</p> <p>\u007f Reduce (a) the number of Ministries (from 16 to 10), (b) the number of \u2018special advisors\u2019 in general government; and (c)</p> <p>fringe benefits of ministers, Members of Parliament and top officials (e.g. cars, travel expenses, allowances)</p> <p>\u007f Tighten the legislation concerning the funding of political parties and include maximum levels of borrowing from financial and other institutions.</p> <p>\u007f Activate immediately the current (though dormant) legislation that regulates the revenues of media (press and electronic), ensuring (through appropriately designed auctions) that they pay the state market prices for frequencies used, and prohibits the continued operation of permanently loss-making media outlets (without a transparent process of recapitalisation)</p> <p>\u007f Establish a transparent, electronic, real time institutional framework for public tenders/procurement \u2013 re-establishing DIAVGEIA (a side-lined online public registry of activities relating to public procurement)</p> <p>\u007f Reform the public sector wage grid with a view to decompressing the wage distribution through productivity gains and appropriate recruitment policies without reducing the current wage floors but safeguarding that the public sector\u2019s wage bill will not increase \u007f Rationalise non-wage benefits, to reduce overall expenditure, without imperilling the functioning of the public sector and in accordance with EU good practices \u007f Promote measures to: improve recruitment mechanisms, encourage merit-based managerial appointments, base staff appraisals on genuine evaluation, and establish fair processes for maximising mobility of human and other resources within the public sector</p> </blockquote> <h2> II. Financial stability </h2> <p><strong>Instalment Schemes. </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Greece commits to:</p> <p> Improve swiftly, in agreement with the institutions, the legislation for repayments of tax and social security arrears \u007f Calibrate instalment schemes in a manner that helps discriminate efficiently between: (a) strategic default/non-payment and (b) inability to pay; targeting case (a) individuals/firms by means of civil and criminal procedures (especially amongst high income groups) while offering case (b) individuals/firms repayment terms in a manner that enables potentially solvent enterprises to survive, averts free-riding, annuls moral hazard, and reinforces social responsibility as well as a proper re-payment culture.</p> <p>\u007f De-criminalise lower income debtors with small liabilities \u007f </p> <p>Step up enforcement methods and procedures, including the legal framework for collecting unpaid taxes and effectively implement collection tools </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Banking and Non-Performing loans. </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Greece is committed to: \u007f Banks that are run on sound commercial/banking principles \u007f Utilise fully the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund and ensure, in collaboration with the SSM, the ECB and the European Commission, that it plays well its key role of securing the banking sector\u2019s stability and its lending on commercial basis while complying with EU competition rules.</p> <p>\u007f Dealing with non-performing loans in a manner that considers fully the banks\u2019 capitalisation (taking into account the adopted Code of Conduct for Banks), the functioning of the judiciary system, the state of the real estate market, social justice issues, and any adverse impact on the government\u2019s fiscal position.</p> <p>\u007f Collaborating with the banks\u2019 management and the institutions to avoid, in the forthcoming period, auctions of the main residence of households below a certain income threshold, while punishing strategic defaulters, with a view to: (a) maintaining society\u2019s support for the government\u2019s broad reform program, (b)</p> <p>preventing a further fall in real estate asset prices (that would have an adverse effect on the banks\u2019 own portfolio), (c)</p> <p>minimising the fiscal impact of greater homelessness, and (d)</p> <p>promoting a strong payment culture.

The two HSBC executives will give evidence to the committee prior to Lin Homer, chief executive of HM Revenue &amp; Customs. She faces questions about why only one person has been prosecuted for avoiding taxes. On Monday while presenting HSBC\u2019s latest results, Gulliver and Flint said they were humbled and shamed by the tax revelations. The Treasury select committee called the hearing after the Guardian and other publications published leaked details of 100,000 bank accounts held by HSBC\u2019s Swiss operation that showed how the bank had helped clients avoid tax and move bricks of cash out of the country. When Gulliver presented the bank\u2019s results on Monday he explained that he had a Swiss bank account to hide his bonuses from colleagues in Hong Kong. The Swiss operation in turn routed his payments through Panama to hide them from other colleagues locally. He also explained why he was non-domiciled in the UK despite being born in the country. \u201cI would expect to die abroad, which is the test around domiciliary,\u201d said Gulliver, who has spent his career at HSBC after leaving for Hong Kong in 1990. He returned to the UK only for a posting with the bank and was promoted to chief executive in 2011, when Flint also moved from finance director to chairman. Gulliver has also apologised in writing in adverts in some newspapers over the Swiss revelations. HSBC will he hoping that MPs, led by Andrew Tyrie, focus on the attempts by Gulliver to clean up the banking group since becoming chief executive. He has sold off 77 businesses and rid the bank of a complex structure of 88 country heads and implemented a reorganisation along business lines. Before Gulliver was called to give evidence, Labour MP John Mann tweeted: \u201cTreasury Committee allocating just 45 minutes to question HSBC on Wednesday. I presume that is for my questions\u201d.",

The company sold 13,509 homes last year, up 17% on 2013, and was upbeat about the outlook for the housing market, despite uncertainty created by the general election in May. Chairman Nicholas Wrigley brushed aside any concerns over a slowdown, saying the economic recovery and the mortgage deals on offer provided a \u201csupportive backdrop for the new homes market\u201d.

Christoph Mueller, who steps down as CEO of the airline this week, said IAG\u2019s \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a31.02bn) offer to buy Aer Lingus would be the biggest single foreign investment in the Republic since the financial crash. Mueller said that there was \u201ca great deal of excitement\u201d that Aer Lingus would be able to create jobs on a much larger scale if IAG, the owners of British Airways, took charge of the former state-run airline. He also stressed that talks between IAG and the Aer Lingus trade unions had been \u201cvery constructive\u201d. Aer Lingus announced on Tuesday that its profits had risen by almost 18% to \u20ac72m from the previous year. Total revenue was up by 9.2%. For the first time in the airline\u2019s history the number of passengers has exceeded 11 million. On the hike in profits and the IAG takeover proposal, Mueller added: \u201cWe profitably expanded our long-haul network utilising our cost advantage and favourable geographic position and helped establish Dublin as the 7th largest European hub for transatlantic connections. \u201cOur short-haul business continued to demonstrate its resilience despite a highly competitive market. Commercial initiatives, in addition to cost control, led to the highest operating profit since the financial crisis and 17.8% above last year.\u201d Opposition to the sale is centred on Irish Labour deputies in the D\u00e1il, in particular those in north Dublin worried about job losses. Some unions have claimed that up to 1,000 jobs could be lost if the sale to IAG goes ahead. IAG chief executive and former Aer Lingus boss, Willie Walsh, met with unions representing workers at the airline on Monday. Former Labour cabinet minister Pat Rabbitte has now backed the proposed sale to IAG while the current government has yet to make up its mind about selling its 25% stake in Aer Lingus. The Fine Gael-Labour coalition\u2019s decision on whether or not to sell its share could prove the deal-maker or deal-breaker for IAG\u2019s plans.",

      "bodyText": "At first, running a small business can seem like a dream come true. You\u2019re the boss. You set your own hours. You have people working for you. Once the honeymoon period is over, however, reality can come as a shock. The lines between work and personal life often get blurred. You\u2019re responsible for the livelihood of your employees. And there\u2019s the everyday stress of running a business: the licenses, the permits, inspections and taxes. To try to minimize some of the headaches that come from bureaucracy, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio last week announced Small Business First, a five-year plan to reduce regulatory obstacles to local businesses. The $27m initiative aims to streamline licensing and permitting for small businesses by bringing together more than 15 city agencies to help. It will create a one-stop shop where business owners can take care of administrative issues \u2013 and settle most fines and violations. \u201cNew York City\u2019s economic growth depends on the ability of its small businesses to start up, scale up and create new jobs,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, president and CEO of the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit organization \u2013 made up of about 300 New York City CEOs \u2013 aiming to enhance the city\u2019s economy. \u201cThe de Blasio administration is taking an important step toward eliminating barriers to small business success by making it easier for entrepreneurs to understand, navigate and comply with city regulations,\u201d she said.

With his new plan, de Blasio aims to ease the burden on small-business owners, increase compliance with city rules and, thereby, reduce fees. Thanks to the reforms, the city is on target to reduce fine revenue by $5m, which will return \u201cdirectly back into the pockets of small business owners, allowing them to reinvest their hard-earned money,\u201d according to Department of Consumer Affairs commissioner Julie Menin. Those fines have already been on the way down for bars and restaurants, which are responsible for about a quarter of a million jobs in New York City. Some $1m of the fines associated with New York\u2019s restaurant grading system collected in its first year \u2013 from July 2010 to July 2011 \u2013 were for restaurants\u2019 failures to display their grade cards.

Speaking at the Institute of Economic Affairs in London, Forbes added that when the time does come for the first rise in interest rates, higher borrowing costs would support the UK\u2019s economic recovery rather than thwart it. \u201cGradual increases in interest rates, if they occur in a timely fashion, should not derail the UK recovery, but instead support and strengthen it.\u201d Interest rates have been held at an all-time low of 0.5% since March 2009. With UK inflation at a record low of just 0.3% and expected to turn negative in the coming months, the MPC is currently under no pressure to raise rates, despite Britain\u2019s economic recovery. However, UK inflation is being driven lower by the slump in global oil prices, which have roughly halved since last summer, and the Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney warned earlier this month that a strong domestic economy would translate into higher UK inflation over the medium term. \u201cThe most likely next move in monetary policy is an increase in interest rates. The message is clear,\u201d Carney said. Forbes said on Tuesday that inflation, asset prices, and household debt were \u201cmoderate and manageable today\u201d, but could deteriorate quickly and would therefore require close monitoring. She said: \u201cThe primary reasons for low inflation today are external factors that will fade quickly \u2013 primarily the sharp fall in oil and gas prices, as well as declines in food and other commodity prices, and the lagged effects of sterling\u2019s past appreciation. \u201cThese factors will restrain headline inflation throughout this year, but then quickly drop out. Even the more lagged effects of sterling\u2019s appreciation will likely peak in the first part of this year and also gradually fade. Inflation will then most likely bounce back. \u201cSince interest rates take well over a year to be fully effective, they should be adjusted to respond to inflationary risks at that time horizon \u2013 when all of these effects have diminished \u2013 rather than respond to today\u2019s inflation.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The North Sea oil and gas industry is facing a severe challenge to its future viability after suffering a dire year which involved the worst losses in decades, a new report has revealed. Oil &amp; Gas UK said its annual activity survey painted a bleak picture of the North Sea\u2019s prospects after discovering that the sector as a whole lost \u00a35.3bn last year, the worst figure since the 1970s. Its report said the cost of producing a barrel of oil had risen to a record high of \u00a318.50, on top of investment, tax and decommissioning costs. Falling oil prices, which slumped to below $50 a barrel earlier this year, cut revenues to just over \u00a324bn for the year, the lowest since 1998. The industry body said the financial situation was so dire that large areas of the North Sea could be \u201csterilised\u201d, because oil companies would be unable to afford to develop and exploit unused fields. The fall in revenues and investment came despite total North Sea output remaining very strong last year, at more than 1.4m barrels of oil equivalent per day \u2013 an industry measure that includes natural gas as well as oil. The 2014 total was the best year-on-year performance since 2000. The chief executive of Oil &amp; Gas UK, Malcolm Webb, said it could increase marginally this year, to 1.43m BOE, but only 14 new exploration wells were drilled last year, compared with the 25 that had been expected. In remarks aimed directly at the chancellor, George Osborne, in advance of next month\u2019s budget, Webb said thousands of high skill jobs, key exports and high-tech industries were at risk unless there were radical changes to the sector\u2019s taxation and incentives regimes. \u201cWithout sustained investment in new and existing fields, critical infrastructure will disappear, taking with it important North Sea hubs, effectively sterilising areas of the basin and leaving oil and gas in the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cThe industry recognises that its cost base is unsustainable. Cost and efficiency improvements of up to 40% are required to give this basin a viable future. This adjustment is now underway, but cost control alone is not the answer.\u201d Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the report made it clear that his department was right to give the industry extra help last December. He said ministers knew about the challenges facing the industry, and hinted that it would get further support in the budget. \u201cI can reassure everyone involved in this vital industry that its future is front and centre of our thoughts as we approach the budget,\u201d he said. Climate campaigners, energy experts and environmentalists say that many of the world\u2019s unused fossil fuels are \u201cunburnable\u201d if global warming is not to breach the 2C threshold set by the UN\u2019s intergovernmental panel on climate change. The Guardian revealed last week that Oil &amp; Gas UK was alarmed by comments from Ed Davey, the UK energy secretary, that action on climate climate could render their reserves worthless. The EU now wants to cut carbon emissions by 60% by 2050. Oil &amp; Gas UK\u2019s report raises challenging questions for the Scottish government\u2019s campaign for Scotland to have far greater fiscal independence in exchange for propping up a minority Labour government after the May general election. In 2012/13, overall government spending in Scotland stood at \u00a365bn, but total Scottish tax receipts excluding North Sea revenues were just \u00a347.5bn \u2013 a hole largely plugged by oil taxes in boom years. The report says that the industry needed to invest \u00a394bn to exploit the 10 billion barrels in known reserves, dramatically cutting the tax receipts needed to sustain Scotland\u2019s higher than average public spending. A continuing slump would also threaten tens of thousands of high-paying jobs. Oil &amp; Gas UK said investment in new production was expected to slip in 2015 by about a third, to a maximum of \u00a311.3bn. Current forecasts suggest that spending on authorised projects was likely to decline rapidly to \u00a32.5bn by 2018, and to \u00a33.5bn for unsanctioned projects. Fergus Ewing, the Scottish energy minister, made no reference to the potential impact of a North Sea slump on Scotland\u2019s balance sheet. Instead, he said, the UK Treasury had to cut taxes and increase financial incentives to help the industry recover urgently. \u201cThis report highlights the long overdue and urgent action on taxation and regulation, which the UK government must deliver to give the industry the certainty it needs to protect jobs and investment,\u201d he said.",
