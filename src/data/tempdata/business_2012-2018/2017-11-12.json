At the International Bar Association\u2019s Human Rights Institute we believe that by failing to collect the revenue that is being lost through offshore tax avoidance schemes, states are failing in their obligation to mobilise all available resources towards the promotion of human rights and poverty reduction. As stated by the former UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty, Magdalena Sep\u00falveda Carmona: \u201cTax abuse is thus not a victimless practice; it limits resources that could be spent on reducing poverty and realising human rights, and perpetuates vast income inequality ... A State that does not take strong measures to tackle tax abuse cannot be said to be devoting the maximum available resources to the realisation of economic, social and cultural rights.\u201d As noted in the institute\u2019s report Tax Abuses, Poverty and Human Rights, the effects of tax evasion on a global scale are being seen most acutely in developing countries, where a huge outflow of money is seeing governments starved of the wealth that they need to invest in health, education and infrastructure. Equally though, its effects are seen here in the UK and other developed countries, where austerity measures are plunging people into poverty and depriving the poorest in society of their economic, social and cultural rights. States have a responsibility to protect human rights, and therefore if the realisation of human rights is affected by a state\u2019s inability to collect tax revenue, then it is the responsibility of all states to ensure that they secure their due taxes.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Denise Coates, the billionaire founder and boss of gambling firm Bet365, paid herself \u00a3217m last year as her company made a \u00a3525m profit from a record \u00a347bn of bets. The 50-year-old, who started Bet365 in a Portakabin in a Stoke car park 17 years ago, is now the best-paid boss in Britain, dwarfing previous titleholder ad man Sir Martin Sorrell on \u00a348m. Coates\u2019s \u00a3199,305,000 pay this year is more than 1,300 times that of the prime minister and more than double the wage bill of Stoke City, the Premier League club owned by Bet365. On top of the \u00a3199m, Coates collected \u00a318m in dividend payments. Coates started out as cashier, marking up results in a small number of betting shops owned by her father, Peter, as a sideline to his main business of football stadium catering. After graduating with a first in econometrics \u2013 the application of statistical methods to economic data \u2013 from Sheffield University, she expanded the family\u2019s Provincial Racing betting chain to nearly 50 shops. As the millennium approached, Coates decided the future of betting lay online and she bought the Bet365.com domain on eBay for $25,000, a move that has catapulted her and her family up the UK\u2019s wealth league. Coates justified her pay packet as fair recognition for the \u201csignificant growth\u201d in the firm\u2019s gambling profits, which rose 15% to \u00a3514m. Revenue from gambling in the 2016-17 financial year jumped 39% to a record \u00a32.15bn, according to the accounts filed at Companies House. Bet365 customers wagered almost \u00a347bn last year, up more than \u00a310bn on the previous year. The company\u2019s TV adverts are fronted by the actor Ray Winstone and are broadcast during many high-profile sporting events. The leap in Bet365\u2019s profits comes as the government and charities grow increasingly concerned about the number of lives ruined by gambling addiction. Tracey Crouch, a minister at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, has warned that as many as 600,000 Britons are \u201cproblem gambling\u201d. The Gambling Commission, the industry regulator, has said 2 million people in the UK are either problem gamblers or at risk of addiction. Mike Dixon, the chief executive of the charity Addaction, said: \u201cIt cannot be right that the CEO of a betting company is paid 22 times more than the whole industry \u2018donates\u2019 to treatment. \u201cThe gambling industry is paying nowhere near enough for the treatment of gambling addicts. It means that there are a lot of people are not getting any help at all. It seems indefensible for the industry to be giving so little, when it is making so much money.\u201d A spokesman for campaign group Fairer Gambling said: \u201cAs losses from Britain\u2019s gamblers continue to spiral out of control, so has executive pay. The entire gambling industry donated just \u00a38m to research, education and treatment last year. If these companies can afford to pay their executives millions of pounds a year, there is no excuse for such chronically underfunded treatment services.\u201d Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said Coates\u2019 pay was \u201cjust a ridiculously massive sum of money\u201d, adding: \u201cWhen a business is making its money in a way that causes a great deal of concern about its level of social responsibility it is even more unacceptable to see someone extracting this amount of wealth while so many people are left as victims in the wake of its business operations. \u201cBusiness does not operate in isolation from society. They shouldn\u2019t be able to get rich while effectively creating massive social problems for the rest of us, who have to pick up the bill for the social cost of people broken by their commercial success.\u201d In her statement to shareholders, Coates said: \u201c[Bet365] recognises its responsibility to minimise gambling-related harm and to keep crime out of gambling. \u201cThe group is committed to developing an evidence-based approach to responsible gambling. To this end, the group continues to work with research partners on a number of projects to improve its methods of identifying harmful play and deliver more effective harm-minimisation interventions. \u201cThe group is assured that its efforts over the past year will continue to evolve over the coming months, and will make further progress in the prevention and minimisation of gambling-related harm.\u201d Even before the bumper pay day, Coates and her family were listed as the 22nd richest in Britain with a \u00a35bn fortune \u2013 more than Sir Richard Branson with \u00a34.9bn. Coates, who keeps out of the public eye, owns just over 50% of the company. Together with the rest of her family \u2013 including brother, John, a co-CEO; husband Richard Smith, a Stoke City director, and father Peter, the chairman of Stoke City \u2013 the Coateses own 93% of Bet365. The company made a \u00a350m donation to the Denise Coates Foundation, which mostly funds medical and education charities and, according to its latest accounts, has not made any donations to gambling or addiction charities. Coates, who was awarded a CBE for services to the community and business five years ago, has become known as the \u201cpatron of the Potteries\u201d for her decision to continue to base Bet365 in Stoke, where it is the largest private sector employer. \u201cWe mortgaged the betting shops and put it all into online,\u201d she said in a rare interview with the Guardian in 2012. \u201cWe knew the industry required big startup costs but \u2026 we gambled everything on it. We were the ultimate gamblers if you like.\u201d She lives quietly in a farmhouse in Sandbach, just outside of Stoke, but drives an Aston Martin with personalised number plates.",

    "webTitle": "Chancellor to receive state of economy news in week before budget", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is to receive some crucial evidence about the health of the UK economy this week as he puts the finishing touches to one of the most difficult budgets in recent times. Official figures are expected to show the squeeze on household finances has intensified in recent weeks, as wage growth fails to keep pace with inflation despite low unemployment. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting official figures out on Tuesday will show inflation rose to 3.1% last month, up from 3% in September. Policymakers at the Bank of England expect the rate to have risen to 3.2%, as the impact of a weaker pound since the Brexit vote continues to feed through to higher shop prices. Any reading above 3% would be the highest for five and a halfyears and would require the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, to write to the chancellor to explain why inflation is more than a percentage point away from its 2% target. The exchange of letters will not be made public until 14 December, when the Bank\u2019s interest rate-setting monetary policy committee announces its next decision. Alan Clark, an economist at Scotiabank, said he expected inflation to have risen to 3.2% last month, with food prices, higher energy bills, clothing and household goods contributing to the increase. But he added that he expected it to begin falling by the end of the year. \u201cOctober inflation will almost certainty hit letter-writing territory,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cWhy is inflation high? Because of the exchange rate. How long will it last? Five minutes. This is probably the only letter the governor will have to write. Inflation should start to come down by Christmas.\u201d The rise will extend the fall in real wages, as prices rise faster than pay. Figures published on Wednesday are expected to show the rate of growth in pay, excluding bonuses, was at 2.1% in the three months to September, compared with a year earlier. This would be unchanged from the three months to August. Pay growth including bonuses is also expected to be 2.1%, down from 2.2%. Pay growth has been persistently weak despite record rates of employment and low unemployment. On Wednesday, the Office for National Statistics is expected to say the jobless rate was unchanged in the three months to September, at a 42-year low of 4.3%. Britain\u2019s economy is expected to lag behind other large European economies this year, with the European commission last week cutting its UK growth forecast for 2017 from 1.8% to 1.5%. Brussels expects the eurozone economy to grow by 2.2% this year, its best performance in a decade. A weaker growth outlook for the UK presents the chancellor with a dilemma in the run-up to the budget on 22 November, as households face greater financial pressures and businesses face uncertainty created by Brexit. Retail sales figures to be released on Thursday are expected to show the first annual drop since March 2013, down 0.7%. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting a small rise of 0.1% in sales for October, after a 0.8% fall in September. Those at Investec, however, expect a 0.4% drop, reflecting the trend in recent weak business surveys. \u201cRetailers suffered their worst performance in six months in September as sales volumes shrank 0.8% month on month following a sharp 0.9% rise in August,\u201d said George Brown, an economist at Investec. \u201cSurveys suggest that another disappointing month is on the cards for Britain\u2019s high street; the BRC [British Retail Consortium] retail sales monitor reported the biggest October drop in like-for-like sales values since 2008, whereas the CBI distributive trades survey indicated that sales volumes had fallen at the sharpest pace since March 2009. \u201cConsumer spending remains under pressure amid the strain that high inflation is currently placing on household finances. Nevertheless, our forecasts suggest consumer price inflation may have peaked, which may offer some respite for retailers further ahead.\u201d",

Nisa said the feedback from recent shareholder meetings suggested growing support for the Co-op offer but other people familiar with the process expressed concern that it would not secure the 75% share of votes required to succeed. \u201cIt certainly feels close,\u201d said one insider. \u201cThis is the biggest thing to happen in Nisa\u2019s 40-year history and has major implications for the future of independent retail in the UK.\u201d Last month, its board recommended that the 1,190 shopkeepers who own the business accept the deal, which includes \u00a320,000 up front as well as deferred payments worth more than \u00a3410,000 for those who own 250 shares in Nisa, the maximum allowed. The Co-op offer values Nisa at about 20 times its current share price. In total, there are about 60,000 shares in issue, with Nisa members each owning between one and 250. While some members have already cast proxy votes online there is expected to be a big turnout at a shareholder meeting being held on Monday at Leeds United Football Club, already the scene of many ill-tempered showdowns. The representative of one influential shareholder group told the Guardian it was a \u201c99.9% no\u201d from it. But Roger Higgins, who runs a five-store family business, said accepting the deal was a \u201cno brainer\u201d. Some of Nisa\u2019s 1,190 members are entrepreneurs running small chains, giving the business a network of 2,400 stores. When it launched in the late 1970s, the goal of the Northern Independents Supermarket Association was \u201cto protect the interests of independents against the insurgence of the national supermarket chains\u201d. However, Nisa members today are divided with some fiercely protective of its independence while others argue it needs more scale given the backdrop of Tesco\u2019s takeover of Booker and rising prices due to the weakness of sterling. Tesco\u2019s move on Booker, the wholesaler behind the Londis and Budges chains, set a cat among the pigeons in a market in which about 80% of the UK\u2019s 41,000-plus convenience stores are still independent or belong to buying groups like Nisa. Nisa has also lost some of its scale after its biggest customer McColl\u2019s defected to the supermarket chain Morrisons in the summer. \u201cThere is growing demand for a tie-up that provides greater buying power,\u201d said a Nisa spokesman. \u201cThe Co-op brings seven times the buying power of Nisa, and is offering members the flexibility to trade as they wish and keep the Nisa name.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s walked away from a \u00a3130m deal to buy Nisa after becoming concerned it would fall foul of competition concerns, while the competition watchdog is expected to give its verdict on the Tesco-Booker deal any day now. It is also thought to be unlikely that the Co-op would return with a higher offer if the one on the table is rejected. Last week, the Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, said it was looking to expand its convenience arm via franchise or wholesale deals. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t overpay for an asset and that is why we are not involved in that process [Nisa],\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Under a page headlined \u201cSweatshop Free Stories\u201d on American Apparel\u2019s website is a video profile of a young Honduran man, Heber Lopez, a garment worker at one of the factories in San Antonio, Honduras responsible for producing the retailer\u2019s clothing. Lopez recounts his hardscrabble life story, the death of his mother when he was nine, a close brush with drug involvement after struggling to find work. \u201cHis options in life were limited,\u201d reads the caption alongside the video \u2013 until he found a job at a factory owned by Gildan Activewear, a giant clothing manufacturer that acquired American Apparel for $88m earlier this year. Once one of the largest apparel producers in the US, American Apparel has long been known for its \u201cMade in USA\u201d trademark, its sometimes controversial advertising aesthetic and its commitment to manufacturing clothes in sweatshop-free facilities. But after a string of scandals related to its founder and former chief executive Dov Charney, and years of financial troubles the brand was auctioned off to Gildan Activewear, an American Canadian manufacturer whose factories are located primarily in Central America and the Caribbean. American Apparel then reopened as an online-only retailer, and by February, it swapped its \u201cMade in USA\u201d mantra with the phrase \u201cGlobally-Sourced,\u201d as most of its apparel is now sourced from factories based in Central America, primarily in Honduras. Still, American Apparel maintains all their products remain ethically made and sweatshop free, claiming its goal is to \u201cgive more ethical jobs to more people around the world\u201d in the Sweatshop Free Stories section of its website. But while the story of Heber Lopez might seem uplifting, many claim that the reality for garment workers is far from the glossy facade it has projected since Gildan acquired the company nine months ago. Ingrid Alicia Benitez, a 39-year-old mother of four, was one of 1,800 garment workers who were left jobless after four years of working at Gildan\u2019s El-Progreso factory in 2004. Her job there was to inspect garments for any defects, and with a quota of 6,000 inspections per day \u2013 every second of her day was accounted for. For Ingrid, that meant a maximum of 10 minutes for lunch each day. It meant avoiding restroom visits unless absolutely necessary. It also meant pushing herself to go to work, regardless of how sick she was feeling that day. \u201cIf we fell short of the quota, our supervisor would threaten us by asking: Do you want to be here tomorrow, or not?\u201d she told The Guardian. But Ingrid needed to support her family, and so, she stayed. By her third year, she had developed consistent muscle pains and a bad cough that she says was widespread amongst garment workers who suffered from the fumes coming from the machinery. By the end of her fourth year, she was let go as part of a mass termination that took place when Gildan shut down its El Progreso plant in order to suppress a unionization effort amongst employees who had banded together to complain about labor rights violations occurring at the factory. The list of complaints included mandatory work shifts longer than the legal maximum limit, illegal dismissals of employees involved in unions \u2013 including the dismissal of a pregnant woman, as well as consistent harassment and verbal abuse targeted at employees. \u201cThe image that Gildan Activewear presents to the world is well-crafted. But we have six organized worker unions from Gildan factories, and they all have health problems,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Luisa Regalado, director of CODEMUH: The Honduran Women\u2019s Collective, an organization which advocates for better living and working conditions for women in garment factories. \u201cMany of the workers have developed disabilities due to health problems acquired on the job \u2013 the hours, high productions goals, and other problems that stem from the lack of studies on the health implications of working in these positions,\u201d she said. Over the years, Regalado and her staff at CODEMUH have worked with dozens of women to address labour rights violations that have taken place in Gildan\u2019s facilities. \u201cIn my experience, Gildan is one of the worst companies as far as labor exploitation goes,\u201d said Regalado. While Ingrid\u2019s experience with Gildan happened over a decade ago, the reality for some women who have worked there more recently is not so different. Just last November, five women came to CODEMUH\u2019s offices in Choloma, Honduras, claiming they were fired for developing health problems incurred while on the job at Gildan\u2019s San Miguel facility. In the dismissal letters issued by Gildan to each woman, almost identical in nature and issued just five days apart, the company informs Paola, another woman named Rosa, Santa, Maria and Aracely that they are being permanently dismissed, and that there is no other position they can be relocated to within Gildan\u2019s facilities due to the medical issues they\u2019ve incurred. The women, whose health issues range from chronic tendonitis in the arms and shoulders, myalgia in the neck and a number of degenerative spinal disorders, were all left without a job, or the ability to work in another factory due to their health troubles. In a letter addressed to Gildan\u2019s chief executive Glenn Chamandy, eight labour organizations from Germany and Switzerland came together to express their disagreement with the dismissals and to criticize conditions at Gildan\u2019s factories, writing: \u201cYou have full knowledge of the work-related illnesses that your workers suffer from. It is NOT fair for you to harm them, and then discard them as if they are objects at your disposal.\u201d Gary Bell, vice-president of communications at Gildan, said Gildan has a strong labour compliance program and has steadily worked with labour unions to address any issue brought to its attention. According to him, the parallels between Gildan\u2019s brand and that of American Apparel are pretty straightforward. \u201cOur corporate social responsibility program is an assurance that former American Apparel customers can basically take and feel just as confident that these products are ethically-made and sweatshop free,\u201d explains Bell. \u201cObviously with 50,000 employees it would be erroneous on my part to say that every single one of these employees loved every minute of their jobs every single day of the year \u2013 that just is not possible. So I think the important thing for us is to build our system in such a way so we can continuously improve on the value we deliver to our employees.\u201d The Workers Rights Consortium (WRC) in Washington, DC has had a long history investigating Gildan\u2019s factories since the El Progreso incident in 2004. According to executive director, Scott Nova, the WRC has identified significant labour rights violations in a number of wholly owned Gildan facilities in recent years. In Nova\u2019s view, the idea that American Apparel built its brand on \u2013 clothing made in the US by workers who make a living wage \u2013 directly clashes with the reality of the operations that take place in Gildan\u2019s factories abroad. \u201cObviously, Gildan is not making the products in the US, but it is also not paying workers a living wage, and there is no particular reason to think that the conditions under which American Apparel clothing are now being made are superior to the general conditions in Honduras or other countries that export apparel,\u201d said Nova. \u201cUsing terms like ethically-made and sweatshop free \u2013 there is no way that that doesn\u2019t make a misleading impression on consumers looking at the American Apparel website,\u201d he added. In the eyes of the WRC, and other labour organizations both in the US and abroad, there is no independent documented evidence to suggest that any Gildan facility in Honduras can be termed ethically made and sweatshop free. Since the video featuring Heber Lopez was posted on the American Apparel website, three more videos have been uploaded on the same page \u2013 one depicting a school in Honduras supported by Gildan, one outlining their environmentally-friendly wastewater treatment system, and another of an in-factory clinic tending to the ailments of Gildan garment workers. Above them all, the same catchphrase is outlined in large, bold, centered letters at the very top of the page: \u201cGlobally-Sourced, Ethically-Made, and Sweatshop Free.

But after a string of scandals related to its founder and former chief executive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/10/american-apparel-dov-charney-sexual-harassment\">Dov Charney</a>, and years of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/25/rise-fall-american-apparel\">financial troubles</a> the brand was auctioned off to Gildan Activewear, an American Canadian manufacturer whose factories are located primarily in Central America and the Caribbean. </p> <p>American Apparel then reopened as an online-only retailer, and by February, it swapped its \u201cMade in USA\u201d mantra with the phrase \u201cGlobally-Sourced,\u201d as most of its apparel is now sourced from factories based in Central America, primarily in Honduras.</p> <p> Still, American Apparel maintains all their products remain ethically made and sweatshop free, claiming its goal is to \u201cgive more ethical jobs to more people around the world\u201d in the Sweatshop Free Stories section of its website. But while the story of Heber Lopez might seem uplifting, many claim that the reality for garment workers is far from the glossy facade it has projected since Gildan acquired the company nine months ago.</p> <p>Ingrid Alicia Benitez, a 39-year-old mother of four, was one of 1,800 garment workers who were left jobless after four years of working at Gildan\u2019s El-Progreso factory in 2004. Her job there was to inspect garments for any defects, and with a quota of 6,000 inspections per day \u2013 every second of her day was accounted for. For Ingrid, that meant a maximum of 10 minutes for lunch each day. It meant avoiding restroom visits unless absolutely necessary. It also meant pushing herself to go to work, regardless of how sick she was feeling that day. </p> <p>\u201cIf we fell short of the quota, our supervisor would threaten us by asking: Do you want to be here tomorrow, or not?\u201d she told The Guardian. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/227323273\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/227323273\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>But Ingrid needed to support her family, and so, she stayed. By her third year, she had developed consistent muscle pains and a bad cough that she says was widespread amongst garment workers who suffered from the fumes coming from the machinery. By the end of her fourth year, she was let go as part of a mass termination that took place when Gildan shut down its El Progreso plant in order to suppress a unionization effort amongst employees who had banded together to complain about labor rights violations occurring at the factory. </p> <p>The list of complaints included mandatory work shifts longer than the legal maximum limit, illegal dismissals of employees involved in unions \u2013 including the dismissal of a pregnant woman, as well as consistent harassment and verbal abuse targeted at employees.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe image that Gildan Activewear presents to the world is well-crafted. But we have six organized worker unions from Gildan factories, and they all have health problems,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Luisa Regalado, director of CODEMUH: The Honduran Women\u2019s Collective, an organization which advocates for better living and working conditions for women in garment factories. \u201cMany of the workers have developed disabilities due to health problems acquired on the job \u2013 the hours, high productions goals, and other problems that stem from the lack of studies on the health implications of working in these positions,\u201d she said. Over the years, Regalado and her staff at CODEMUH have worked with dozens of women to address labour rights violations that have taken place in Gildan\u2019s facilities. </p> <p>\u201cIn my experience, Gildan is one of the worst companies as far as labor exploitation goes,\u201d said Regalado.</p> <p> While Ingrid\u2019s experience with Gildan happened over a decade ago, the reality for some women who have worked there more recently is not so different. Just last November, five women came to CODEMUH\u2019s offices in Choloma, Honduras, claiming they were fired for developing health problems incurred while on the job at Gildan\u2019s San Miguel facility. </p> <p>In the dismissal letters issued by Gildan to each woman, almost identical in nature and issued just five days apart, the company informs Paola, another woman named Rosa, Santa, Maria and Aracely that they are being permanently dismissed, and that there is no other position they can be relocated to within Gildan\u2019s facilities due to the medical issues they\u2019ve incurred. The women, whose health issues range from chronic tendonitis in the arms and shoulders, myalgia in the neck and a number of degenerative spinal disorders, were all left without a job, or the ability to work in another factory due to their health troubles. </p> <p>In a letter addressed to Gildan\u2019s chief executive Glenn Chamandy, eight labour organizations from Germany and Switzerland came together to express their disagreement with the dismissals and to criticize conditions at Gildan\u2019s factories, writing: \u201cYou have full knowledge of the work-related illnesses that your workers suffer from. It is NOT fair for you to harm them, and then discard them as if they are objects at your disposal.\u201d</p> <p> Gary Bell, vice-president of communications at Gildan, said Gildan has a strong labour compliance program and has steadily worked with labour unions to address any issue brought to its attention.

      "bodyText": "America\u2019s role as the world\u2019s economic superpower was established in the period between 1870 and the start of the first world war. The country boomed, immigrants arrived in their millions and the rich coined it in. Even now the names are familiar: John D Rockefeller; Andrew Carnegie; the Vanderbilt family. They called it the Gilded Age. Never before had America\u2019s superrich had it so good and, until recently, it was assumed they would never have it so good again. Yet the 2017 billionaires report compiled by the Swiss bank UBS and the consultancy firm PwC finds that the clock would have to be turned back to 1905 \u2013 when the Russians were having a trial run for their revolution and Queen Victoria had been dead only four years \u2013 to find a time when wealth was so concentrated. A separate study by the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington produced similar findings. Bill Gates, who founded Microsoft, Jeff Bezos, the man behind Amazon, and the investor Warren Buffet own as much wealth between them as the poorer half of the American population \u2013 160 million people, it found. The trio are the Carnegie, Rockefeller and Vanderbilt of the modern age. This is not simply a US phenomenon. China looks very much like the US of the late 19th century, with fast growth, rising real incomes for industrial workers and the rise of a new cadre of superrich people. Josef Stadler, the author of the UBS/PwC report, said: \u201cWe are now two years into the peak of the second Gilded Age,\u201d and he added that the 1,542 dollar billionaires around the world were concerned about how concentrated wealth has become. But not, it seems, concerned enough to do anything about it. The rich show real tenacity when it comes to holding on to their wealth and the system that generates it. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) describes it as rentier capitalism, whereby the stifling of competition allows excess profits to be made. Under a properly functioning free-market economy this is not supposed to happen. The economist Joseph Schumpeter said it was acceptable for an entrepreneur, say Gates or Bezos, to make excess profits temporarily if they had come up with a genuinely new product. But these rents would not last for long because rivals would quickly enter the market, bringing an end to the monopoly as there were no intellectual property rights (IPRs) to defend them. They were the reward for thinking ahead of the curve. There are cases where the use of IPRs can be justified. Patents are widely used by the pharmaceutical industry to prevent cheaper alternatives. The justification is that the development of new drugs is hugely expensive and that without the chance to make excess profits there would be no incentive to come up with life-saving products. The UNCTAD report, though, says that market-leading companies are abusing IPRs to ensure that they can see off potential rivals. \u201cLarge firms use patent protection to raise barriers to entry in an industry and bolster their own market power. Thus, superstar firms benefitting from erecting initial technological barriers to entry can use this advantage to further expand their market power in other ways, for example through pricing strategies that make new entrants nonviable,\u201d it said. The upshot is a drift towards oligopoly \u2013 in which the market is dominated by a small number of firms \u2013 and in some cases monopoly. Rentier capitalism is rife on Wall Street, but it is not just the financial services sector that is affected. As the UNCTAD report notes, in almost half of all US industries in 2012 the four largest companies accounted for at least 25% of all industry revenue. In 14% of all industries, the four largest firms captured over 50% of all revenues. What\u2019s more, the sectors in which there was the biggest increase in market concentration showed the biggest increases in profits. These were not the result of firms making themselves more efficient; instead, they exploited market power to keep prices higher than they otherwise would have been. UNCTAD\u2019s point is that fast-rising market power and concentration is explained by the reversal of measures such as anti-trust laws, financial regulations and fiscal policies that were designed to deliver full employment and to strengthen labour\u2019s bargaining hand. \u201cOnce institutional countervailing powers \u2013 such as those of nation states, civil society and labour organisations \u2013 have been weakened, corporate rentierism has flourished. More generally, this raises the possibility of a \u2018Medici vicious circle\u2019, where money is used to get political power and political power is used to make money.\u201d If revulsion at the concentration of wealth and the exploitation of market power becomes strong enough there is nothing to stop governments smashing monopolies and raising taxes. This, after all, is what happened last time, with the first Gilded Age followed in the US by two waves of reforms, the pre-first world war Progressive era and during the New Deal of the 1930s. In his book Capital in the 21st Century, Thomas Piketty notes that in the early 20th century, the US led the way on tackling wealth disparities, proving intellectually more prepared than other advanced countries to accept a steeply progressive income tax. In an article for American Prospect, Paul Starr notes that limiting the power of concentrated wealth in the US is a cause with deep roots. That explains why anti-trust laws were used to break up Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil in 1911, and why the 16th amendment to the constitution brought in a federal income tax in 1913. The US political backlash, in both the Progressive era and the 1930s, went right to the top. Teddy Roosevelt was in the White House when the anti-trust suit which ultimately resulted in the dissolution of Standard Oil was launched; Woodrow Wilson vehemently denounced corporate lobbying and Franklin Roosevelt made clear what he thought of Wall Street when he said in his 1936 re-election campaign that government by organised money was as dangerous as government by organised mob. To rapturous applause, FDR went on to say that big money was \u201cunanimous in its hatred for me, and I welcome that hatred\u201d. Like FDR, Donald Trump has appealed to those in America who think the system is rigged against them. Unlike FDR, he has so far shown not the slightest inclination to do anything to make the system less rigged. To do that, Trump would have to make the tax system more progressive, reduce the power of corporate lobbying, resist pressure for stronger intellectual property rights and stop the wealthy from salting their money away in tax havens. None of this is on his agenda, which explains why America is a country where competition is thwarted, excess profits are rife and the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley are the new robber barons. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 November 2017. An earlier version said that \u201cTeddy Roosevelt was in the White House when Standard Oil was broken up\u201d. Roosevelt was president when the anti-trust suit was launched in 1909 but had left office by the time the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution in 1911.",

More generally, this raises the possibility of a \u2018Medici vicious circle\u2019, where money is used to get political power and political power is used to make money.\u201d</p> <p>If revulsion at the concentration of wealth and the exploitation of market power becomes strong enough there is nothing to stop governments smashing monopolies and raising taxes. This, after all, is what happened last time, with the first Gilded Age followed in the US by two waves of reforms, the pre-first world war Progressive era and during the New Deal of the 1930s. In his book Capital in the 21st Century, Thomas Piketty notes that in the early 20th century, the US led the way on tackling wealth disparities, proving intellectually more prepared than other advanced countries to accept a steeply progressive income tax. In an article for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://prospect.org/article/how-gilded-ages-end\">American Prospect</a>, Paul Starr notes that limiting the power of concentrated wealth in the US is a cause with deep roots.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>That explains why <a href=\"https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/may-15-1911-supreme-court-orders-standard-oil-to-be-broken-up/\">anti-trust laws were used to break up Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil in 1911</a>, and why the 16th amendment to the constitution brought in a federal income tax in 1913.</p> <p>The US political backlash, in both the Progressive era and the 1930s, went right to the top. Teddy Roosevelt was in the White House when the anti-trust suit which ultimately resulted in the dissolution of Standard Oil was launched; Woodrow Wilson vehemently denounced corporate lobbying and Franklin Roosevelt made clear what he thought of Wall Street when he said in his 1936 re-election campaign that government by organised money was as dangerous as government by organised mob. To rapturous applause, FDR went on to say that big money was \u201cunanimous in its hatred for me, and I welcome that hatred\u201d.</p> <p>Like FDR, Donald Trump has appealed to those in America who think the system is rigged against them. Unlike FDR, he has so far shown not the slightest inclination to do anything to make the system less rigged. To do that, Trump would have to make the tax system more progressive, reduce the power of corporate lobbying, resist pressure for stronger intellectual property rights and stop the wealthy from salting their money away in tax havens. None of this is on his agenda, which explains why America is a country where competition is thwarted, excess profits are rife and the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley are the new robber barons.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 November 2017. An earlier version said that \u201cTeddy Roosevelt was in the White House when Standard Oil was broken up\u201d. Roosevelt was president when the anti-trust suit was launched in 1909 but had left office by the time the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution in 1911. <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Will early 2019 be remembered as the beginning of the end for competition in the UK energy market? That is likely to be the time when Theresa May\u2019s price cap on energy bills takes effect and two titans of the market complete the merger they proposed last week. The new company to be created by Npower and SSE means the so-called \u201cbig six\u201d energy suppliers will shrink to five. More importantly, it means half of the market will belong to just two companies: the new firm and British Gas. The move certainly makes sense for Npower\u2019s parent Innogy, SSE, and its shareholders. Supplying electricity and gas to households has become a tougher business. Both firms have been losing customers to more than 50 smaller companies, who are mostly cheaper and more innovative, and now hold a fifth of the UK retail energy market. And with millions of their customers on the standard variable tariffs that May is capping, both face further financial pressure that could last for years. The rationale for the deal is strengthened by the fact that Npower\u2019s brand is tarnished, and it has been making a significant loss since 2015. SSE, meanwhile, has the highest proportion of households on the tariffs that will be capped. But will the merger help customers? There are already warnings that such mergers are \u201crarely a good thing for consumers\u201d. The removal of one big player in a market that is still largely differentiated on price could clearly hurt competition. The new giant could primarily use its economies of scale to maintain profit margins and rewards for its shareholders. And the mooted efficiencies of integrating SSE\u2019s old IT system with Npower\u2019s newer one could prove to be a pain rather than a panacea, making costs and customer service worse rather than better. The counter-argument is that those efficiencies could be realised and then used to give a bloody nose to Centrica\u2019s British Gas, driving down prices for consumers in the process. British Gas is a member of the \u201cbig six\u201d, but in reality it has always been the \u201cbig one\u201d, utterly eclipsing the other five in scale. Its new rival could be the first with the advertising clout, lobbying power and size to offer a potential counterweight. Advocates for the merger believe that an energy company solely focused on supplying households, as opposed to running power stations and energy networks, will be more focused and single-minded. It also won\u2019t have those other units to fall back on \u2013 so will in theory be hungrier and more competitive, too. All eyes are now on whether the European commission and UK competition watchdog will wave the plan through, as the groups hope. Given the new supplier\u2019s sizeable revenues and fact it will have just a million fewer customers than British Gas, it is far from certain that it will be given the green light. What is guaranteed, barring a dramatic political surprise, is that 11 million households on standard variable tariffs will have their prices capped sometime in 2018 or 2019. It is hard to see how this will help competition. Business secretary Greg Clark maintains that this year\u2019s record switching between suppliers will not be harmed by the cap, as it would be designed in such a way that competition could continue under the ceiling. But few in the industry seriously believe switching won\u2019t decline under a cap. Some consumers will be lulled into the idea that they are being protected by the government, while others will not want the hassle as the savings from switching fall from as much as \u00a3300 now to perhaps as little as \u00a370. Any fall in switching will benefit the incumbents with the biggest customer bases today. And with 12.7 million customers, the new Npower/SSE will stand to benefit more than most. Why the social media small fry find it so hard to grow into big fish Nothing stands still for long in the fast-moving world of social media. Just ask Twitter, or Snap, owner of Snapchat. Once upon a time \u2013 only eight months ago in the case of Snap \u2013 these were must-have investments at flotation. The investment bankers whipped up the excitement. The world agreed that the valuations looked rich but, hey, this was a chance to own a slice of a business that could be the next Facebook or Google. The shares flew out of the traps. Snap, priced a $17 a pop, hit $27 almost immediately. Twitter, whose IPO in late 2013 was pitched at $26, reached $69 at the start of 2014. Look at them now. Snap has drifted close to $12 after yet more disappointing figures. New users are arriving at a \u201clower rate than we would have liked\u201d, conceded co-founder Evan Spiegel. Over at Twitter, the shares have recovered ground since lows this summer but are still below the IPO price, at $20. And it, too, is trying new tricks. The original 140-character limit on tweets is being increased to 280, infuriating some users and pleasing others. If there\u2019s a common explanation for their woes, it\u2019s that Snap and Twitter are corporate minnows with niche products compared with Facebook and Google. Advertisers follow eyeballs religiously, and the arrival of automation to sell advertising reinforces the process and drives rate down. It\u2019s easy to forget just how small Snap is. A daily average user base of 178 million sounds enormous until you see quarterly revenues of just $208m. Net losses tripled to $443m in the latest period. At least revenue is still growing at Snap: for Twitter, third-quarter revenues were down 4% to $590m. On the other hand, the company is at least close to making a profit, unlike Snap. It all feels like splashing around in the shallows while Facebook makes the social media waves. Twitter has 330 million monthly average users, whereas Facebook has 2 billion. Investors are belatedly getting the message: sometimes Goliath wins. Belfast built ships. So could it build post-Brexit banks? One of the many issues the UK government has to tackle in Brexit talks is the border on the island of Ireland. A report in the Financial Times last week suggested that the EU was demanding that Northern Ireland stay in the customs union and single market to avoid a hard border on the island. Putting the political ramifications to one side, this could raise an interesting economic proposition. International banks with large London operations are looking for new office space in EU cities such as Frankfurt, Dublin and Paris to make sure that Brexit does impede their ability to do business after March 2019. Imagine Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein tweeting: \u201cJust left Belfast. This city built ships (popped into the Titanic museum) reckon can build banks too.\u201d It would add a new twist to the banker\u2019s Brexit-related tweets, in which he has both extolled the virtues of Frankfurt and posted a picture of building work on its new London headquarters, with the words, \u201cexpecting/hoping to fill it up\u201d.",
