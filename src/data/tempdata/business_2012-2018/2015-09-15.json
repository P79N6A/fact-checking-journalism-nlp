      "bodyText": "Sharp falls in petrol and diesel pulled UK inflation back down to zero last month as tumbling crude oil prices trickled down to households. Official figures showed inflation on the consumer prices index edged back down to 0.0% in August from 0.1% in July, continuing the trend since the start of this year of virtually no year-on-year rise in living costs. Inflation has been below the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target for the past 20 months. Economists said the lack of inflation would continue to boost consumer spending, the main driver of economic growth in the UK. \u201cThis period of noflation or lowflation \u2013 whatever you want to call it \u2013 has undoubtedly been good news for the UK. The falling price of essentials has come at the same time as a rapid acceleration in wage growth since the start of the year, boosting discretionary spending power,\u201d said Scott Corfe at the Centre for Economics and Business Research thinktank. \u2018Lowflation\u2019 The headline figure was in line with the consensus forecast in a poll of economists by Reuters. But some had been expecting cheaper fuel to nudge inflation down to -0.1% or even -0.2% , marking a return to the negative territory hit in April this year when prices fell for the first time in more than 50 years. As a result, the pound strengthened against the dollar after the data, as some traders wagered it left the door open for the Bank of England to start raising interest rates after more than six years at a record low of 0.5%. The US Federal Reserve is expected, by a slim majority of economists, to hike its main interest rate this week, although experts believe the UK\u2019s central bank will wait until at least early next year to follow suit. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has hinted at a possible move around the turn of the year. He has also sought to play down fears about the UK falling into outright deflation and said cheaper oil prices were positive for the UK economy as they boost household budgets. Ian Stewart, chief economist at consultancy Deloitte, said the latest inflation figures pointed to more support for consumer confidence. \u201cWith the price of essentials like food, transport and fuel down sharply on a year ago, inflation is flat on its back,\u201d he said. \u201cWith inflation forecasts for next year sliding, the Bank is under no pressure to hike rates. Low inflation is the Bank of England\u2019s trump card in coping with the effects of weakness in China and choppy equity markets.\u201d Fuel and clothing keep inflation down The Office for National Statistics said the main downward pressure on inflation in August came from clothes prices rising by less than they did a year earlier, and from cheaper fuel prices. Diesel fell by 6.2p a litre and petrol fell by 2.4p a litre last month, both bigger decreases than a year ago. The core rate of inflation, which strips out volatile items such as food and energy, edged down to 1.0% in August from 1.2% in July. That slowdown and recent signs that the economy may be losing steam would likely keep interest rates on hold well into 2016, said economists. Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said: \u201cBefore inflation shows definitive signs of a pick-up, which is unlikely to happen this year, the BoE will have to exercise caution. In addition to the lack of inflation, the economic recovery remains quite uneven. While the pace of growth is still decent at this point, tentative signs of a slowdown are appearing in the data.\u201d The Trades Union Congress also raised concerns over the economic outlook. \u201cZero inflation is not a route to raising living standards,\u201d said the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady. \u201cThe recovery can\u2019t be taken for granted and we need significant investment in skills, innovation and infrastructure to boost productivity and ensure a sustainable economy that works for the many and not just the few.\u201d",

Not since the oil price-induced spike in 2011, which sent petrol and gas costs spiralling, have consumers suffered such a sustained attack on their living standards. Since then it has been downhill all the way, reflecting the turmoil in the eurozone and then the slowdown in China, the world\u2019s economic engine room. This year prices have flatlined. And the lack of energising forces in the world economy look like keeping prices flat for some time. Goldman Sachs said last week the oil price could fall to $20 (\u00a313) a barrel from the near $45 a barrel it currently commands. That\u2019s a long way from the $107 West Texas Intermediate crude hit in June 2014. There are two ways for central bank interest rate setters to read this collapse in inflation. It could be a global phenomenon that national policymakers can ignore should their own economies be doing well. This would allow the US Federal Reserve to press ahead with an interest rate rise on Thursday and Britain likewise next spring. Both economies have created lots of jobs in the past three years and wages have crept higher. Business confidence is high and consumers are borrowing to spend with a renewed vigour. The alternative view would concentrate on the continued lack of demand in the global economy and the negative impact on trade. While Britain\u2019s wages might edge higher, they are unlikely to have their traditional effect \u2013 an upward pressure on prices. Wider forces \u2013 from low oil prices to weak commodity values and a surplus in global labour supply \u2013 will push costs down, not up. In this environment, higher interest rates are a growth killer and central banks must sit on their hands. There is no reason to increase. If anything, there is a need to go the other way and for central banks to directly support growth with extra investment. But never underestimate the lobbying power of the investment community. As far as the billion-dollar pension funds, endowment funds and sovereign wealth funds are concerned, we need to see higher interest rates and soon.

    "webTitle": "Glencore's reputation is still vulnerable despite fundraising", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The delay couldn\u2019t last much longer. A full week had passed since Glencore said it would raise $2.5bn (\u00a31.6bn), an interval in which the modest rally in the share price had evaporated. In early trading on Tuesday, shares in the mining-cum-trading house hit a new low of 118p. It was time to get on with the job of raising the cash. The result is a placing of 1.3bn shares, equivalent to almost 10% of the current equity base. Chief executive Ivan Glasenberg and his executive colleagues are buying 22% of the new shares \u2013 at a cost of a shade over $500m \u2013 a strong display of confidence, and an even stronger display of personal wealth. Is $2.5bn enough though? The stock market\u2019s immediate reaction, one suspects, will be to push Glencore\u2019s shares higher because one small uncertainty has been removed. Yet two big factors haven\u2019t changed. The first is Glencore\u2019s vulnerability to more falls in the prices of copper and coal. The former has shown signs of stability in the last week, partly because Glencore itself is shutting a couple of mines, but coal shows no hint (yet) of reaching a trough. After the fundraising, Glencore is less indebted than it was but, remember, the starting point was borrowings of $30bn. The second factor can\u2019t be measured so precisely. It is the damage to Glasenberg\u2019s reputation for reading the market. Last year\u2019s $1bn share buyback \u2013 at an average of roughly 300p a share versus 128p now \u2013 was plainly a mistake, born of over-optimism. Yet even last month Glasenberg held the interim dividend, before being bounced by shareholders into cancelling future payments as part of the $10bn debt-reduction plan. In other words, Glencore is the first big London-listed miner in the commodities downturn to have to raise equity to reinforce its balance sheet. It\u2019s quite a come-down for a company that used to boast its trading division offered protection in all weathers. Treasury should stop meddling Robert Chote, now starting his second term as head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, is a robust individual. As he says, he is someone quite capable of telling any irritating or meddling Treasury official to buzz off. This is reassuring, and, as Chote also pointed out on Tuesday, he annoyed the chancellor more than once in his first term with his descriptions of government spending plans. Thus one can understand why Chote preferred to play down the row over an email from a Treasury official that appeared to break the rule that the government should respect the OBR\u2019s independence by not interfering in its work. The rest of us, though, should not be so relaxed. One passage in that email, obtained by The Times, jars horribly. \u201cIt won\u2019t come as a surprise, I\u2019m sure, but we haven\u2019t strictly stuck to the \u2018factual changes only\u2019 requests so we\u2019re giving you our full download and suggestions,\u201d it read. The tone, admittedly, might be said to convey more hope than expectation that the OBR will be swayed. Yet it also seems to suggest that Treasury officials routinely attempt to blur the line between facts and opinion in their correspondence with the OBR. If that is correct, it\u2019s time to stop the practice before matters turn uglier. The author is said to be only a junior Treasury official but Andrew Tyrie\u2019s select committee is right to take this matter seriously by delving deeper into correspondence before last year\u2019s autumn statement. The OBR is one of George Osborne\u2019s best creations. Its forecasts can be wrong but outsiders need to know they made without interference. The chancellor, one hopes, will grasp the point. A stiff warning to officials, reminding them that they do not have a licence to try their luck in dealings with the OBR, would be in order. Hastings may struggle to keep up the pace Roll up, roll up, Goldman Sachs would like to sell a few shares in an insurance company at five times the price it paid last year. This does not seem an obvious bargain. Hastings, to be fair, has improved at a steady gallop since Goldman paid \u00a3150m for a stake of just under 50% in January last year. It has continued to grow customers and profits at a compound rate of 22%; and in Gary Hoffman, who cleared up the wreckage at Northern Rock, it has a respected chief executive. Yet the idea that 100% of Hastings, even after raising \u00a3180m of cash, could now be worth as much as \u00a31.5bn stretches credibility. The company offers many reasons why its underwriting, pricing and fraud-detection is better than rivals\u2019. Some boasts may even be fair since Hastings is clearly doing something right to gather 5.5% of the market for private car insurance and make operating profits of \u00a3106m last year. But one thing every investor knows about car insurance is that very few companies grow at 22% for ever. The last exciting prospect was esure, which is still below the price it floated at in 2013. Goldman and Hastings\u2019 founders will sell only a quarter of their stakes, so this is not a stampede for the exit. But caution is required on pricing given the industry\u2019s unreliable record. Forget \u00a31.5bn; about \u00a31.2bn looks more like it.",

      "body": "<p>The delay couldn\u2019t last much longer. A full week had passed since Glencore said it would raise $2.5bn (\u00a31.6bn), an interval in which the modest rally in the share price had evaporated. In early trading on Tuesday, shares in the mining-cum-trading house hit a new low of 118p. It was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/15/glencore-fundraiser-share-placing-shore-up-finances-ivan-glasenberg\">time to get on with the job of raising the cash</a>.</p> <p>The result is a placing of 1.3bn shares, equivalent to almost 10% of the current equity base. Chief executive Ivan Glasenberg and his executive colleagues are buying 22% of the new shares \u2013 at a cost of a shade over $500m \u2013 a strong display of confidence, and an even stronger display of personal wealth.</p> <p>Is $2.5bn enough though? The stock market\u2019s immediate reaction, one suspects, will be to push Glencore\u2019s shares higher because one small uncertainty has been removed. Yet two big factors haven\u2019t changed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/07/glencore-ceo-to-shell-out-210m-during-restructuring-drive\">Glencore CEO to shell out $210m during restructuring drive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first is Glencore\u2019s vulnerability to more falls in the prices of copper and coal. The former has shown signs of stability in the last week, partly because Glencore itself is shutting a couple of mines, but coal shows no hint (yet) of reaching a trough. After the fundraising, Glencore is less indebted than it was but, remember, the starting point was borrowings of $30bn.</p> <p>The second factor can\u2019t be measured so precisely. It is the damage to Glasenberg\u2019s reputation for reading the market. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2015/sep/07/share-buyback-is-a-terrible-advert-for-glencores-abilities\">Last year\u2019s $1bn share buyback</a> \u2013 at an average of roughly 300p a share versus 128p now \u2013 was plainly a mistake, born of over-optimism. Yet even last month Glasenberg held the interim dividend, before being bounced by shareholders into cancelling future payments as part of the $10bn debt-reduction plan.</p> <p>In other words, Glencore is the first big London-listed miner in the commodities downturn to have to raise equity to reinforce its balance sheet. It\u2019s quite a come-down for a company that used to boast its trading division offered protection in all weathers.</p> <h2>Treasury should stop meddling</h2> <p>Robert Chote, now starting his second term as head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, is a robust individual. As he says, he is someone quite capable of telling any irritating or meddling Treasury official to buzz off.</p> <p>This is reassuring, and, as Chote also pointed out on Tuesday, he annoyed the chancellor more than once in his first term with his descriptions of government spending plans. Thus one can understand why Chote preferred to play down the row over an email from a Treasury official that appeared to break the rule that the government should respect the OBR\u2019s independence by not interfering in its work.</p> <p>The rest of us, though, should not be so relaxed. One passage in that email, obtained by The Times, jars horribly. \u201cIt won\u2019t come as a surprise, I\u2019m sure, but we haven\u2019t strictly stuck to the \u2018factual changes only\u2019 requests so we\u2019re giving you our full download and suggestions,\u201d it read.</p> <p>The tone, admittedly, might be said to convey more hope than expectation that the OBR will be swayed. Yet it also seems to suggest that Treasury officials routinely attempt to blur the line between facts and opinion in their correspondence with the OBR. If that is correct, it\u2019s time to stop the practice before matters turn uglier.</p> <p>The author is said to be only a junior Treasury official but Andrew Tyrie\u2019s select committee is right to take this matter seriously by delving deeper into correspondence before last year\u2019s autumn statement. The OBR is one of George Osborne\u2019s best creations. Its forecasts can be wrong but outsiders need to know they made without interference.</p> <p>The chancellor, one hopes, will grasp the point. A stiff warning to officials, reminding them that they do not have a licence to try their luck in dealings with the OBR, would be in order.</p> <h2>Hastings may struggle to keep up the pace</h2> <p>Roll up, roll up, Goldman Sachs would like to sell a few shares in an insurance company at five times the price it paid last year. This does not seem an obvious bargain.<br></p> <p>Hastings, to be fair, has improved at a steady gallop since Goldman paid \u00a3150m for a stake of just under 50% in January last year. It has continued to grow customers and profits at a compound rate of 22%; and in Gary Hoffman, who cleared up the wreckage at Northern Rock, it has a respected chief executive. Yet the idea that 100% of Hastings, even after raising \u00a3180m of cash, could now be worth as much as \u00a31.5bn stretches credibility.</p> <p>The company offers many reasons why its underwriting, pricing and fraud-detection is better than rivals\u2019. Some boasts may even be fair since Hastings is clearly doing something right to gather 5.5% of the market for private car insurance and make operating profits of \u00a3106m last year.</p> <p>But one thing every investor knows about car insurance is that very few companies grow at 22% for ever. The last exciting prospect was esure, which is still below the price it floated at in 2013.</p> <p>Goldman and Hastings\u2019 founders will sell only a quarter of their stakes, so this is not a stampede for the exit. But caution is required on pricing given the industry\u2019s unreliable record. Forget \u00a31.5bn; about \u00a31.2bn looks more like it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The embattled commodity trader Glencore launched its $2.5bn (\u00a31.6bn) fundraising effort on Tuesday night, in a move aimed at shoring up its strained finances as swiftly as possible. The share placing, part of a $10.2bn programme of fundraising and cuts announced last week, came in a week when Glencore\u2019s struggling shares hit new lows. It will see the company\u2019s billionaire chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, putting up as much as $210m of his own cash. The sale of new shares was forced on the company by investors worried that the group\u2019s debts are too high in a world of slumping commodity prices, as previously booming demand from China has slowed. Glencore said its bankers would attempt to place just over 1.3bn new shares to new and existing shareholders in an accelerated sales process that is expected to close no later than 7pm BST on Wednesday. The new shares represent just under 10% of the company. Last week Glencore succumbed to shareholder pressure by announcing it would raise up to $2.5bn by selling new shares \u2013 only weeks after the company\u2019s management insisted they were comfortable with the group\u2019s financial position. Glasenberg and his senior management immediately committed to buying 22% of them, worth around $550m. However, City investors will be anxious for news on how successful Glencore\u2019s bankers have been in selling the remaining 78%. If they succeed in selling all the new stock \u2013 and raising $2.5bn \u2013 the fundraising will have secured the cash at only a small discount to the closing share price on Tuesday evening of 3%. However, raising $2bn from selling the same amount of new equity would equate to a discount of about 22%. The trading group did not comment further on the announcement, or give any detail on which existing shareholders would be purchasing new shares. However, aides insisted privately that a share placement was always the company\u2019s preferred method of raising the funds \u2013 rather than a rights issue, which would have involved all existing shareholders being given the chance to invest. The second option would have taken too long, one aide said, before adding that major investors had been supportive of Glencore\u2019s plan. The company\u2019s shares have more than halved this year and closed on Tuesday evening at 128.05p each. The company floated in 2011 at 530p a share, but they have never reached that level since. Glasenberg and his four closest lieutenants, who all became paper billionaires in the group\u2019s 2011 flotation \u2013 Daniel Mat\u00e9, Telis Mistakidis, Tor Peterson and Alex Beard \u2013 own around 20% of the company. To maintain that stake, the five men now have to find around half a billion dollars in cash. However, by the time he is paid his latest dividend cheque later this month, the total dividends received by Glasenberg since the company floated will have exceeded $780m. The group, which trades and produces a range of commodities including copper, iron ore, oil, wheat and sugar, also announced last week that it will be selling some assets and has suspended production at copper mines in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It has also axed the full-year dividend payout to shareholders, and next year\u2019s interim dividend. The series of measures will find the company an extra $10.2bn, which will be used to cut debts \u201cto the low 20 billions of dollars by the end of 2016\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The online shopping revolution in Britain is showing signs of reaching a peak after internet sales in August grew at the slowest rate on record. Online sales increased by 5% in August compared with sales in the same month last year, the lowest increment since online sales data started being collected in 2000. The rise of online shopping has forced shops to close, transforming British high streets, and led to internet retailers, such as Amazon, Asos and Ocado, becoming household names. However, sales growth has been sluggish throughout 2015, suggesting it might be approaching a plateau. Online sales account for a fifth of non-food retail sales in Britain, but for some individual retailers, such as Argos, it is approaching half. The development of mobile internet technology through smartphones and tablets has given online sales an extra boost in the past five years, while Black Friday last November created a further surge in internet orders as retailers offered cut-price deals on electrical items. Black Friday is a US tradition where retailers cut prices on the Friday after Thanksgiving in an attempt to get customers back into shops. However, American-based retailers, such as Walmart, the owner of Asda, have brought the tradition to Britain. Experts believe Black Friday could be another reason for the slowdown in online sales growth this year, with shoppers holding back spending until November. According to the IMRG Capgemini online sales index, sales in August were down 6% on July. On top of the slow August performance, which was not helped by the late bank holiday, 2015 has already seen the worst quarterly performance on record. In the first quarter of 2015, online sales rose 7% year-on-year, the first time sales have grown by single digits during a three-month period. Sales growth recovered to 14% in the second quarter of 2015, but has now fallen back again. Andy Mulcahy, the editor of IMRG, said: \u201cIt has been a bit topsy-turvy I think it\u2019s fair to say. \u201cIf you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000, it was always going to rationalise over time. But what happened is that in 2012 and 2013, mobile really kicked in. That came in at a meteoric rate and buoyed it again. \u201cIt meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contexts, such as on the sofa. But now that is plateauing a bit, you might see it [growth] fall away.\u201d Mulcahy said there was little evidence of a new technology being introduced that could drive another surge in online sales. \u201cSome new technology could make it shoot up again. Could the smartwatch boost it and reach more people? It is difficult to see where the technology is going now. Is it going to wearables? Google Glass has been put to one side.\u201d IMRG, the trade body for online retailers, has identified five potential reasons for the 2015 slowdown: demand for online shopping peaking among shoppers, spending being held back until Black Friday, disruption from the general election, the strength of the pound putting off overseas customers, and households spending their money on leisure activities instead. \u201cIt could be all of them coming together,\u201d Mulcahy said.",

      "bodyText": "A day after the televised debate in Greece between Syriza\u2019s Alexis Tsipras and New Democracy\u2019s Vangelis Meimarakis, the latter has said he would seek a coalition with Syriza if it wins Sunday\u2019s election. Newspaper Kathimerini reports: \u201cIf New Democracy wins the elections, I will first meet with Alexis Tsipras to try to form a government,\u201d Meimarakis said. Questioned about potential alliances during Monday\u2019s debate, Tsipras insisted that he believed Syriza would win an overall majority but that he would otherwise be prepared to form a \u201cprogressive\u201d coalition. He ruled out an \u201cunnatural\u201d alliance with New Democracy, saying \u201cWe have radical differences on key issues.\u201d On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow, counting down the hours until the Federal Reserve rate decision. Despite another bad day on the Chinese stockmarket, European shares managed to gain some ground, spurred by a positive early performance by Wall Street. Traders said the prospect of a rate rise in the UK this year diminished after inflation came in at zero, while uninspiring data from the US seemed to suggest the Federal Reserve may well hold off on raising borrowing costs later this week. However another theory for the rise was that the uncertainty about what the Fed planned to do would be ended if it actually acted and raised rates. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 53.01 points or 0.87% at 6137.60 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.56% to 10,188.13 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.13% to 4569.37 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.62% to 21,903.63 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.89% higher at 9782.5 In Greece the Athens market added 1.36% to 682.17 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 175 points or 1% higher. Markets may be moving higher today, but they are stuck in no-man\u2019s land ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting this week, says Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG: Ahead of what looks like the most vital Fed meeting in years, the best thing for markets to do would be simply to sit still and wait for Thursday afternoon. With that being impossible, they have opted for the second choice, namely running around in circles. A near 150-point range on the FTSE 100 today looks relatively busy, but in fact the index remains stuck within the range that has dominated all September. This is not an environment for long-term decision making, indeed so much is riding on Thursday\u2019s events the market has become even more short-sighted than normal. Nonetheless, the longer the FTSE 100 remains stuck below 6200, the more it seems that the next big move is down. Despite the recovery off the lows of August, the index remains stuck in a downtrend, with so far little sign of a sustained comeback. Back with Greece, and Syriza\u2019s government programme is out (here in Greek), five days before the election. Here\u2019s an interesting little graphic from the World Economic Forum: After Monday\u2019s television debate in Greece between Syrza\u2019s Alexis Tsipras and New Democracy\u2019s Vangelis Meimarakis, comes a new ballot showing a marginal increase in support for the latter ahead of Sunday\u2019s elections: Wall Street has opened higher after the retail sales and industrial production data, but investors remains cautious ahead of the Fed meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 36 points or 0.24% in early trading, while European markets are also heading in the right direction, with the FTSE 100 up 0.3%, Germany\u2019s Dax 0.26% higher and France\u2019s Cac 0.54% better. Another piece of weak US data, with industrial production falling 0.4% in August, adding to the evidence against a Federal Reserve rate rise. This compares to forecasts of a 0.2% decline, and a 0.9% rise in July. Rob Carnell at ING Bank said: US August industrial production was even softer than consensus expectations, falling 0.4% month on month, with manufacturing down 0.5% month on month (consensus = -0.3%). Much of the weakness was in the vehicles sector, and when this is stripped out, production was flat on the month - still not great however, and this ex-vehicles segment has been flat, down or very weak for months now. If there are any bright spots, it is in utilities, which rose 0.6%, though mining put in another fall of 0.6%. All in all, weak, disappointing, and taken together with other data earlier today - retail sales and Empire manufacturing, nudges the argument in the direction of the FOMC doves. With only consumer price inflation left to come before the September 17 meeting, and that likely to be on the low side, the data dependent Federal Open Market Committee might find the pendulum swinging a little more to the \u201cno hike\u201d side. A no change from the Fed is not a universal opinion however. Harley Bassman at investment group Pimco argues that the uncertainty of waiting for the Fed to raise rates is worse than the central bank actually lifting them slightly: There are likely few market watchers who think that a 0.25% hike would have any real economic impact. (In fact, even a 1.0% funds rate would barely affect most businesses\u2019 decision making processes since many commercial loans have a 1.0% floor.) Moreover, it is also clear that the U.S. economy has reached the limits of monetary policy stimulus. What is unknown is the degree to which \u201canimal spirits\u201d are diminished by the endless drama of guessing when the Fed will finally start hiking. Think about it: A 0% interest rate likely has little positive value and a 0.25% higher rate has little negative value, but the uncertainty, the anxiety of not hiking is significantly bothersome to all as this topic absorbs all the oxygen in the room \u2013 frankly, Hamlet debated less. The full post is here: Note to the Fed: Don\u2019t Be Hamlet Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief US economist also cannot really see the Fed raising rates: The US retail sales figures are among the last significant pieces of economic data before the Federal Reserve meets to decide whether or not to raise interest rates. The decision seems finely poised, with the recent volatility in China seen as a good reason for the Fed to hold off, at least temporarily. As for the retail sales themselves, Rob Carnell at ING Bank reckons they will not be the evidence that finally decides the Fed to lift borrowing costs: Though the figures, once adjusted for prior revisions, are roughly in line with consensus, this comes across as a fairly ordinary result, not one that will encourage any wavering [Fed] doves to switch their vote to a September hike. ...This would be a more convincing set of figures if one did not have to exclude all the weak parts to make the number look strong, and we don\u2019t think the [Fed] members will be substantially moved by this data. Separately, the latest Empire manufacturing survey for the New York region continued to languish at -14.67 only marginally improved from -14.92. Today\u2019s data tally in total is at best neutral for the September Federal Open Market Committee, and probably a slight negative overall. The US retail sales figures for August are out. And while they\u2019re a little weaker than expected, they show that consumers are still spending. Retail sales rose by 0.2% last month, the Commerce Department reports, missing forecasts of a 0.3% rise. They were dragged down by lower spending at the pumps. Retail sales excluding gasoline rose by 0.4%. Over in Athens the talk of the town today ahead of Sunday\u2019s general elections is all about last night\u2019s debate between the two men now battling for the post of prime minister. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Who emerged victorious? Five days before potentially decisive polls for the country\u2019s future, that is the question pundits and much of the Greek media are asking today. Was it the leftist former prime minister Alexis Tsipras? Or was it Vangelis Meimarakis, the political veteran who has been the surprise winner of these elections so far, unexpectedly leading the pro-business, pro-European New Democracy to within a whisper of Syriza in the polls. Or even the debate itself? A debate that will go down as the tenth to be conducted before a poll, and this time in a way that allowed the protagonists to spar with each other openly (not literally, alas - Ed). A good part of the media this morning unaminously agreed that it was polarisation \u2013 the inability of either the left or right to bridge differences enough to agree on anything substantial. \u201cThe top televised debate rolled with zero consensus between Tsipras and Meimarakis,\u201d Ta Nea proclaimed under the front-page headline \u201cpolarisation won.\u201d \u201cThe two political leaders insisted on [maintaining] a line of polarisation despite mention of consensus and collaboration, with the aim of rallying voters in the last stretch to elections.\u201d In that sense neither won \u2013 despite expections that the two-hour chin wag would sway the undecided (at 10% of the electorate, they will ultimately decide the outcome). When taken to task over implementation of the reforms set as the condition for a third EU backed bailout programme, both agreed they would enforce it \u2013 postehaste. If anything, the debate marked the defeat of the anti-bailout front. But analysts also agreed that in terms of polished performance Tsipras came out on top. \u201cIn substance Meimarakis [won], but visually Tsipras was a rock star,\u201d said Dimitris Kerides, who teaches international politics at Panteion University. Aristides Hatzis, professor of economics and law at Athens University concurred. \u201cI think Tsipras emerged the winner. He unashamedly gave new promises and underplayed his compromises and especially his failures,\u201d he told me, adding: \u201cMeimarakis put on an OK performance but he looked more uncomfortable especially when it came to criticising his own party.\u201d Whether Tsipras will be able to win over the young \u2013 appalled by the volte-face he has made embracing \u2018neo-liberal\u2019 policies \u2013 remains to be seen \u2013 and the young, along with women, account for most of those who remain undecided and have vowed to abstain from Sunday\u2019s ballot. French economists are manning the barricades today, protesting about the decision to appoint Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau as the next head of the Bank of France. Around 150 of France\u2019s finest economic experts have signed a letter arguing that Villeroy de Galhau is unsuitable as he served as co-chief operating officer of BNP Paribas until May. In the letter, published in Le Monde today, they argue that this creates a serious conflict of interest. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande could and should have picked someone else. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if the president did not have a choice. It was entirely possible to promote, at the heart of the Bank of France, an internal candidate who is much less exposed to the risk of conflicts of interests.\u201d European Central Bank official Benoit Coeure was one option, although that would have deprived ECB president Mario Draghi of a key ally. Draghi, incidentally, worked for Goldman Sachs before becoming Italy\u2019s central bank chief in 2005. Mark Carney, the Bank of England\u2019s governor, is also a Goldmanite. So Villeroy de Galhau won\u2019t be treading a new path when he replaces Christian Noyer in November. But still, it\u2019s an uncomfortable development. We have a couple of pieces of eurozone data to flag up too. Employment across the single currency bloc rose by 0.3% in the last quarter, as the region\u2019s slow recovery continues. Employment rose in 22 EU countries, and fell in just four, according to Eurostat. However, confidence across German investors has shrunk sharply this month. The ZEW future expectations index slid form 25 in August to 12.1 in September, suggesting pessimism is gripping Europe\u2019s largest economy. Over to my colleague Katie Allen to round-up today\u2019s inflation data: Sharp falls in petrol and diesel pulled UK inflation back down to zero last month as tumbling crude oil prices trickled down to households. Official figures showed inflation on the consumer prices index edged back down to 0.0% in August from 0.1% in July, continuing the trend since the start of this year of virtually no year-on-year rise in living costs. Inflation has been below the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target for the past 20 months. Economists said the lack of inflation would continue to boost consumer spending, the main driver of economic growth in the UK. \u201cThis period of noflation or lowflation \u2013 whatever you want to call it \u2013 has undoubtedly been good news for the UK. The falling price of essentials has come at the same time as a rapid acceleration in wage growth since the start of the year, boosting discretionary spending power,\u201d said Scott Corfe at the Centre for Economics and Business Research thinktank. The headline figure was in line with the consensus forecast in a poll of economists by Reuters. But some had been expecting cheaper fuel to nudge inflation down to -0.1% or even -0.2% , marking a return to the negative territory hit in April this year when prices fell for the first time in more than 50 years. As a result, the pound strengthened against the dollar after the data, as some traders wagered it left the door open for the Bank of England to start raising interest rates after more than six years at a record low of 0.5%...... Here\u2019s her full story: Here\u2019s a handy colour-coded graph showing how UK inflation has fluctuated since the financial crisis began: The cost of oil and metals has fallen through the summer, as concerns has grown over China\u2019s economic slowdown. And for that reason, Ranko Berich of City firm Monex Europe fears UK inflation could fall further, especially if the global economy worsens. He argues: \u201cThe downside risks to inflation are now mounting, with the latest falls in commodity prices adding more volatility to the global economy. The general consensus at the Bank is that energy prices will at least stabilise, so if crude oil prices take another hit the UK economy could be in for a bumpy ride. With this report showing no sign of labour market gains filtering through to higher consumer prices, the Bank of England\u2019s extreme caution around rates now seems entirely justified.\u201d This era of no-flation does not extend to Britain\u2019s housing market. Property prices jumped by 2% in July alone, meaning house price inflation is running at over 5%. Money editor Patrick Collinson explains this morning\u2019s data: The average house price rose by more than \u00a31,000 a week, leaping from \u00a3277,000 to \u00a3282,000, a new all-time high and 16.7% above the pre-financial crisis peak in 2007. But on a seasonally-adjusted basis, average annual house price inflation dipped to 5.2% from 5.7%, in part due to price falls in Scotland and the north-east of England. And here\u2019s the picture across Britain\u2019s regions: The British Chambers of Commerce disagrees with the Institute of Directors, and wants the Bank of England to leave interest rates unchanged. Chief economist David Kerr argues that Britain\u2019s economy isn\u2019t robust enough to handle a hike. \u201cLow inflation supports living standards by boosting disposable income and will help to sustain the economic recovery. However, last week\u2019s poor trade and manufacturing figures show that the recovery is still fragile, particularly in the face of major global uncertainties. \u201cThe prospect of continuing low inflation and global uncertainty should give the MPC no need to contemplate a premature increase in interest rates. We urge the MPC to keep rates at their current level until well into 2016.\u201d The TUC\u2019s general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, argues powerfully that the Bank of England should not raise interest rates right now. \u201cZero inflation is not a route to raising living standards. And with future economic prospects so uncertain, early interest rate rises would bring real risks to households. \u201cThe recovery can\u2019t be taken for granted and we need significant investment in skills, innovation and infrastructure to boost productivity and ensure a sustainable economy that works for the many and not just the few.\u201d Today\u2019s drop in inflation hasn\u2019t deterred the Institute of Directors from repeating its call for interest rates to rise. Michael Martins, the IoD\u2019s economic analyst, argues that Britain\u2019s economy looks healthy despite the problems in China and the eurozone. And with inflation at zero, households are benefitting from rising real wages and higher spending power. Thus, the time to start normalising rates has arrived (even though there\u2019s no immediate need to hike borrowing costs to tame inflation): Given the strength of the UK economy, pickup in output, tightening labour market, and tentative signs of productivity increases, the Bank of England must be prepared to follow the Federal Reserve if it raises rates on Thursday. I suspect the IoD are ahead of the curve on this one, with most City economists predicting rates will remain low until 2016. But we shall see.... The government has welcomed today\u2019s inflation report, even though it shows the Bank of England is failing to hit the 2% target. A Treasury spokeswoman says: Today\u2019s inflation figure means a real boost for working people and family budgets across our one nation, with prices essentially frozen compared to last year while wages continue to rise. This is a reminder that we must continue to work through our long term plan to build a resilient economy \u2013 delivering the economic security of a country that lives within its means, financial security of lower taxes and a new National Living Wage, as well as national security of a Britain that defends itself and its values.\u201d It\u2019s a bit of a leap from cheaper petrol prices to the Security of the Nation. But this is now one of the government\u2019s new attack lines at Labour\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Inflation is expected to remain flattish for the next few months. This latest drop in inflation is due to \u201cthe slump in the oil price, a washed out summer keeping shoppers away from the high street, falling sea fares and the ongoing supermarket price wars\u201d. So says Maike Currie, associate investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, who isn\u2019t too worried about the deflation threat. \u201cIt is important to distinguish between disinflation - a slowdown in the rate of inflation; and deflation \u2013 a persistent and ongoing fall in prices. The two are not the same thing. Both food and fuel - the main drivers of the historically low inflation numbers we are seeing - are two essential items. No-one is going to delay their weekly trip to the supermarket or stop filling up their car\u2019s petrol tank, because they expect prices may fall next month. Deflation is dangerous because it causes companies and consumers to do the exact thing that causes more deflation \u2013 delay spending in the hope of further price falls in the future.\u201d Inflation has now been flat or negative for five out of the past seven months, far from the Bank of England\u2019s 2% inflation target. The BBC\u2019s economics editor, Robert Peston, wonders if Britain is entering a protracted period of very weak inflation, or worse.... This chart confirms that cheaper food and transport costs kept inflation pegged at zero over the last year. Although Britons did benefit from a smaller rise in clothing prices in August, that\u2019s partly because shops offered less generous discounts in the July sales. The ONS says: Clothing prices, overall, rose by 1.5% between July and August this year compared with a rise of 2.6% between the same 2 months a year ago. Prices of clothing and footwear usually rise between July and August as autumn ranges start to enter the shops following the summer sales season. The smaller rise this year follows a sales period in which prices fell by less than a year ago. The downward contribution came from price movements across a range of garments but particularly from women\u2019s outerwear. Food prices across the UK have fallen by 2.8% over the last year, according to today\u2019s inflation report, while motor fuel is 12.9% cheaper. The Bank of England is probably relieved that UK inflation didn\u2019t turn negative for the second time this year. Inflation in the UK was held back by clothing prices, which rose at a slower pace this summer. The Office for National Statistics says: A smaller rise in clothing prices on the month compared with a year ago was the main contributor to the slight fall in the rate. There were also downward effects from changes in motor fuel prices and sea fares. Rising prices for soft drinks and for furniture and furnishings partially offset the fall. The UK\u2019s annual inflation rate, the consumer prices index, has fallen back to zero. That\u2019s down from 0.1% in July. The cost of living was pulled down by lower oil prices, the Office for National Statistics reports. Prices were 0.2% higher in August than in July, but unchanged compared with August 2014. And the core inflation rate, which strips out volatile factors such as energy and food prices, has dropped to 1% from 1.2%. More details and reaction to follow Europe\u2019s stock markets are following China\u2019s lead lower. After a solid start, the FTSE 100 has now shed 52 points or almost 1%. Commodity firm Glencore is the biggest faller, down 6.3%, tracking a drop in metals prices. More on this after the UK inflation data..... It\u2019s nearly time for the main economic data of the morning, the UK inflation figures for August. Analysts, economists and investors are all watching closely, to see how the consumer prices index changed last month. Tony Cross of Trustnet explains: These numbers have the ability to influence interest rate decisions \u2013 expect the Bank of England to be looking at the core rate excluding food and fuel prices Today\u2019s selloff suggests Chinese investors aren\u2019t confident that Beijing can successfully stimulate its economy, and pump up the stock market boom again. IG\u2019s market strategist Bernard Aw says: \u201cNormally, expectations of more growth boosting action would lead to demand for smaller and speculative stock, like the ChiNext or Shenzhen Composite Index, but today, market participants were probably not convinced that there will be a big plan in the pipeline.\u201d Chinese authorities may be relieved that the Shanghai stock market didn\u2019t finish the day below the 3,000 point mark today. At one stage, the Shanghai Composite hit 2,984 before struggling back. Perhaps with some assistance?... Back in China, the stock market has posted its biggest two-day fall in three weeks. The Shanghai Composite Index closed for the day down 3.5% at 3004 points, meaning it has now lost 7% of its value this year. Commodity producers and technology companies led today\u2019s selloff, which takes the index back towards the eight-month low reached last month. Economists are concerned that the Chinese economy is weakening rather faster than the official data, which shows growth of around 7% this year . Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says its research suggests the Chinese economy grew at an annual rate of 5.3% in the second quarter of 2015, and just 4.5% in Q3. There is also concern that recent interventions by Bejing have not revitalised the markets. As Zhang Haidong, chief strategist at Jinkuang Investment Management, put it: \u201cThe economy has not shown signs of a pick up after a series of cuts in interest rates and reserve requirements, while expectations about yuan depreciation are still there.\u201d BMW has now told reporters that CEO Harald Kr\u00fcger has seen a doctor and is recovering well. The company added that this morning\u2019s moment of dizziness follows a recent trip abroad. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s early take on events in Frankfurt: BMW AG suspended a press conference at the Frankfurt International Motor Show after Chief Executive Officer Harald Kr\u00fcger collapsed on stage. The CEO, 49, was escorted offstage by two assistants after the incident. The event was Kr\u00fcger\u2019s first appearance at the Frankfurt show as BMW\u2019s chief. He took the top post at the Munich-based carmaker in May. There\u2019s drama over in Frankfurt, where the CEO of German carmaker BMW has just appeared to faint during a presentation at the Motor Show. A planned press conference was cancelled after Harald Kr\u00fcger fell to the ground during a presentation on stage. He did then walk away after being helped to his feet, so hopefully he\u2019s OK. Reuters has the story: German luxury carmaker BMW\u2019s new chief executive, Harald Kr\u00fcger, fainted on stage at the Frankfurt auto show on Tuesday, a Reuters witness reported. Krueger collapsed as he was commenting on BMW\u2019s latest models during a news conference. Two men escorted him off stage. Kruger was able to walk. A BMW spokesman said over the public address system: \u201cI\u2019m a bit lost for words. BMW will try to redo the press conference at a later stage.\u201d Automotive journalist Jonathan Brownfield is there, and confirm that the press conference is off: The recent drop in the oil price probably helped to keep the cost of living pegged in August. My colleague Katie Allen explains: The headline inflation rate is forecast to edge down to zero for August from 0.1% in July, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll of economists. Some even see inflation on the consumer prices index (CPI) measure turning negative again after a sharp fall in crude oil prices and a supermarket price war cut the cost of petrol and diesel. \u201cOur forecast for August is that the headline measure of CPI inflation fell back to 0.0%, but there is a significant risk that it heads back into negative territory,\u201d said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec. Here\u2019s Katie\u2019s preview of the data, due at 9.30am BST: BAML also found that few investors expect the Federal Reserve to announce an interest rate hike this week. A majority expect the Fed to act before the end of the year, though. City investors are increasingly concerned about the possibility that China\u2019s economy falls into recession, according to the latest survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. They\u2019ve stopped fretting about the eurozone, though. China\u2019s stock market is on track for its worst two days since the drama of late August. Another wave of selling has swept through the country\u2019s trading floors today, as investors fret about recent disappointing economic data. This has send the Shanghai composite index down by over 3% in late trading, adding to yesterday\u2019s 2.7% decline. There\u2019s still around 30 minutes left, though, so we could see the authorities intervene to prop up shares. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Inflation is one of the issues of the moment, as central bankers in Britain and America ponder whether it\u2019s safe to end the long period of cheap money and start raising interest rates. And we get a new healthcheck on the UK situation today, when the latest consumer prices index (CPI) is released. Economists reckon that inflation could fall back to zero, from just +0.1% in July. It could even be negative. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets predicts that today\u2019s inflation report will give little support to those who favour hiking borrowing costs soon: August inflation is set to remain weak with annual CPI set to fall back to 0% from 0.1% in July. Even more importantly core CPI inflation is also expected to fall furtherfrom 1.2% in July to 1%. Retail prices (RPI) are also set to decline further as well, below the 1% level to 0.9% as lower fuel and clothing prices weigh on prices. Good news for UK consumers, if so. Here\u2019s today\u2019s economic calendar: 9.30am: UK inflation data 10am: German ZEW economic sentiment survey 10am: Eurozone Q2 unemployment survey, and trade balance for July 1.30pm: US retail sales for July Spread-betters are predicting a subdued start to trading in London: Companies reporting results this morning include online supermarket Ocado, and the DIY chain Kingfisher. And we\u2019ll be keeping one eye on Greece, ahead of Sunday\u2019s general election, and other events through the day....",

Traders said the prospect of a rate rise in the UK this year diminished after inflation came in at zero, while uninspiring data from the US seemed to suggest the Federal Reserve may well hold off on raising borrowing costs later this week. However another theory for the rise was that the uncertainty about what the Fed planned to do would be ended if it actually acted and raised rates. So the final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished up 53.01 points or 0.87% at 6137.60</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.56% to 10,188.13</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.13% to 4569.37</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.62% to 21,903.63</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.89% higher at 9782.5</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece the Athens market added 1.36% to 682.17</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 175 points or 1% higher.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-09-15T16:58:46.420Z\">at 5.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55f83c2ce4b0dd400d533074\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-15T15:43:11.818Z\">4.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets may be moving higher today, but they are stuck in no-man\u2019s land ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting this week, says Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG:</p> <blockquote> <p>Ahead of what looks like the most vital Fed meeting in years, the best thing for markets to do would be simply to sit still and wait for Thursday afternoon. With that being impossible, they have opted for the second choice, namely running around in circles.</p> <p>A near 150-point range on the FTSE 100 today looks relatively busy, but in fact the index remains stuck within the range that has dominated all September. This is not an environment for long-term decision making, indeed so much is riding on Thursday\u2019s events the market has become even more short-sighted than normal. Nonetheless, the longer the FTSE 100 remains stuck below 6200, the more it seems that the next big move is down. Despite the recovery off the lows of August, the index remains stuck in a downtrend, with so far little sign of a sustained comeback.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55f83bf1e4b0dd400d533073\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-15T15:40:37.167Z\">4.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MxSba/statuses/643806489765912576\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Undecided voters are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a>&#39;s third largest party right now, polls show.

(In fact, even a 1.0% funds rate would barely affect most businesses\u2019 decision making processes since many commercial loans have a 1.0% floor.) Moreover, it is also clear that the U.S. economy has reached the limits of monetary policy stimulus.</p> <p>What is unknown is the degree to which \u201canimal spirits\u201d are diminished by the endless drama of guessing when the Fed will finally start hiking.</p> <p>Think about it: A 0% interest rate likely has little positive value and a 0.25% higher rate has little negative value, but the uncertainty, the anxiety of not hiking is significantly bothersome to all as this topic absorbs all the oxygen in the room \u2013 frankly, Hamlet debated less.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full post is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://blog.pimco.com/2015/09/14/note-to-the-fed-dont-be-hamlet/?utm_source=hootsuite&amp;utm_medium=social_media&amp;utm_content=fed_hamlet&amp;utm_campaign=pimco_blog\">Note to the Fed: Don\u2019t Be Hamlet</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55f81a69e4b0dd400d532fb5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-15T13:18:23.349Z\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief US economist also cannot really see the Fed raising rates:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lavorgnanomics/statuses/643774146648887297\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It is very hard to see a dovish <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FOMC?src=hash\">#FOMC</a> raising <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fed?src=hash\">#Fed</a> funds rate in an environment of skittish household and business confidence</p>&mdash; Joseph A.

      "bodyText": "Kingfisher is to open 200 Screwfix outlets and close one-in-six B&amp;Q stores as the company restructures itself to reflect changing DIY habits. The expansion of Screwfix, which is aimed at tradesmen such as plumbers and electricians is a response to British households moving away from DIY in favour of paying specialists to do home improvements. The new Screwfix stores will expand the chain to more than 600 across the country, which will help Kingfisher offset the closure of 60 B&amp;Q stores and the 3,000 job losses the move could entail. Kingfisher\u2019s chief executive, V\u00e9ronique Laury, announced the expansion of Screwfix as the retailer posted half-year results. The company, which also owns Castorama and Brico D\u00e9p\u00f4t in France, said pre-tax profits fell 1.8% to \u00a3386m in the six months to 1 August. Like-for-like sales fell 0.3% in France, but rose 3.3% in the UK and Ireland thanks to a 16.5% increase in Screwfix sales, driven by plumbers and electricians. Laury replaced Sir Ian Cheshire at the head of the company at start of the year. Her \u201cOne Kingfisher\u201d strategy revolves around merging the company\u2019s international brands so that the retailer\u2019s stores in Britain, France and the rest of Europe will sell the same products. The plan has sparked speculation that the B&amp;Q brand could eventually disappear in favour of Castorama. Laury said: \u201cI am pleased that we have delivered a solid first half of the year and have made good early progress with our \u2018One Kingfisher\u2019 plan. This plan will unlock our potential through organising ourselves very differently in order to create a single, unified company where customer needs come first.\u201d She denied rumours the group might axe the B&amp;Q brand and said there were no plans currently to change the chain\u2019s name. The group also said it expected the introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d in April to cost it around \u00a35m next year. A number of retailers have recently warned about the impact of the measure, which will see workers aged 25 and over paid \u00a37.20 an hour from next April, rising to \u00a39 from 2020. The company said it was encouraged by the economic backdrop in the UK, but cautious about prospects in France. Andrew Hall, a consultant at the retail analysts Conlumino, said: \u201cKingfisher has posted a somewhat muted set of results, as the French outlets Castorama and Brico D\u00e9p\u00f4t, and the UK\u2019s B&amp;Q continue to encounter a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. \u201cLeveraging the solid performance of Screwfix in this way is welcome but perhaps overdue news. B&amp;Q is facing wider market issues, as demand for DIY declines amid disinterest among young consumers in particular. Reigniting consumer engagement is imperative for the retailer, and this is reflected in the focus of its recent \u2018Unleash the B&amp;Q in You\u2019 advertising campaign.\u201d Kate Calvert, a retail analyst at Investec, said the update on Kingfisher\u2019s overhaul showed the new chief executive was \u201cgetting stuck in\u201d, but that its results were evidence that European economic woes continue to affect the business.",

      "bodyText": "Bankers are predicting a revival in stock market flotations in London after Hastings, the car insurer, announced it intends to raise \u00a3180m from an initial public offering, valuing the group at up to \u00a31.5bn. The Hastings float could earn the investment arm of Goldman Sachs, a shareholder in the business, a return of \u00a3100m with a matching windfall for a group of investors led by the company founder, Neil Utley. One banker said the Hastings move could be followed by other businesses as market conditions improve. \u201cAfter the summer lull, the election and the turmoil in China, there is anecdotal evidence that there are a lot of IPOs coming down the pipeline.\u201d Worldpay, the payments processing group chaired by former CBI president Sir Mike Rake, is one of the companies waiting in the wings. However, its plans, set to value the group at up to \u00a36bn, might be derailed by one of two competing trade bids and there is also some tentativeness about a potential US interest rate rise upsetting the markets. However, those concerns have not deterred the owners of Hastings. Goldman Sachs bought a 50% stake in the business in October 2013 for a sum believed to be around \u00a3150m. Also benefiting from the flotation will be the group\u2019s 1,900 employees, who will be in the frame for two cash payouts as part of the deal. Utley, who has already earned \u00a3135m from selling down his Hastings shareholding, is one of Britain\u2019s richest men. He is a collector of luxury cars and bought David and Victoria Beckham\u2019s Hertfordshire estate for \u00a311.5m last year. Censured by a Lloyd\u2019s enforcement tribunal in 2013 for failing to have adequate controls in place when he was chief executive of the insurance group IAG UK, Utley will not sit on the Hastings board after the flotation. There will be no women on the post-IPO board, which will be chaired by a former deputy chief executive of Lloyds Bank, Michael Fairey. This will make it one of the few larger listed groups not to have a single woman on its main board following an initiative from Lord Davies to encourage female representation in business. The chief executive of Hastings, Gary Hoffman, said: \u201cI wish we had a couple of women non-executives but they are in great demand and are busy and we didn\u2019t find anyone. We want better representation in the future.\u201d Hoffman, who joined in 2012 from NBNK, the group that bid unsuccessfully for high street branches sold off by Lloyds Banking Group, said that running Hastings had been a fantastic experience. \u201cIt\u2019s been really enjoyable creating 1,250 jobs in two years,\u201d he said. Before NBNK, Hoffman had rehabilitated Northern Rock after its nationalisation in 2009 and had to implement a major downsizing and restructuring programme. \u201cThat period of my life felt like 30 years,\u201d he said, \u201cwhereas three years at Hastings seems like three months.\u201d Hoffman said the group had achieved customer growth of 17% last year and profits growth of 19% to \u00a3105.7m. The management team will shortly go on a road show to the US, Europe and around the UK. It hopes to issue the new shares in October and the company is expected to have a market capitalisation of between \u00a31bn and \u00a31.5bn.",

      "bodyText": "Ocado has warned that Morrisons would be unable to start its own internet operation because it was tied to a 25-year deal to sell food online through Ocado\u2019s online service. Reporting solid trading for the third quarter, Duncan Tatton-Brown, Ocado\u2019s finance director, said: \u201cOcado is the exclusive provider of online grocery services for Morrisons. That is the terms of the deal for the remaining 23 years. The contract will prevent [Morrisons launching another service. \u201cIf [Morrisons] want coverage elsewhere in the UK they have to come through us. We are happy to have that discussion. The decision is theirs. Who provides it is us.\u201d Morrisons signed the deal with Ocado in a bid to catch up with its rivals\u2019 online operations but the supermarket group is now under new management. Morrisons\u2019 new chief executive, David Potts, has sold the M convenience shops opened by his predecessor, Dalton Philips, and is focusing on reviving Morrisons\u2019 larger stores. Ocado has been saying since it signed the Morrisons deal it would sign similar agreements with retailers outside the UK to use its technology for online sales. It has given itself until the end of this year to announce a second tie-up and Tatton-Brown said he expected to achieve that goal. He said the company continued to talk to several potential partners. In the 12 weeks to 9 August, Ocado\u2019s retail sales rose 15.3% to \u00a3252m from a year earlier with average orders each week up 16.6% to 190,000. The average order size fell 1.1% to \u00a3110.46 because of price competition, Tatton-Brown said, adding that the squeeze was slightly less severe than in the first half of the year. Ocado stocks a selection of Waitrose products alongside branded and Ocado own-label products, but the two companies have competed for online sales in the south-east of England since 2011. The companies\u2019 10-year supply contract has a break clause in 2017 and the start of this month was the deadline for the earliest termination of the contract. Tatton-Brown said: \u201cWe would expect to work with Waitrose for some time to come.\u201d",

Morrisons\u2019 new chief executive, David Potts, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/sep/09/morrisons-needs-to-answer-questions-over-convenience-store-sale\">has sold the M convenience</a> shops opened by his predecessor, Dalton Philips, and is focusing on reviving Morrisons\u2019 larger stores.</p> <p>Ocado has been saying since it signed the Morrisons deal it would sign similar agreements with retailers outside the UK to use its technology for online sales.

      "bodyText": "Malcolm Turnbull has but a year to inject confidence and strength into the economy or else he will be swept from office and condemned to history as a wrecker of a first term Liberal government. The prime minister, and his likely new treasurer, Scott Morrison, take over the economic levers at a time when economic growth is sluggish, unemployment is high, real wages are falling and consumer and business confidence are weak. Add to that a still-hefty budget deficit and escalating government debt and the picture of the economic challenge for Turnbull and his new team is stark. This is especially the case when the next election is just a year away where the economy will almost certainly be the dominant issue for voters. One major shortcoming of Tony Abbott and his treasurer Joe Hockey was their failure to articulate the challenges before the Australian economy, instead continually reverting to slogans about \u201cjobs and growth\u201d and \u201cstopping the boats\u201d. This made it impossible for them to outline a framework of essential economic reform to deal with those challenges and to set the economy on a path to growth and lower unemployment. The fact that the Abbott reform agenda was like Old Mother Hubbard\u2019s cupboard \u2013 bare \u2013 compounded their dismal failure. For the lost two years of economic management, Abbott and Hockey will stand condemned. For Turnbull and his team, a revamp of policy is not only essential for the economy, it is vital for their electoral prospects, given the likely sniping they will face from the rightwing, particularly on social, environmental and international policy issues. Turnbull has to acknowledge the fact that government spending is at levels only ever before seen in Australia during times of recession, which means some careful pruning of spending is needed. Either that, or Turnbull must come clean with the electorate that tax hikes \u2013 money from their pockets \u2013 is needed if the Coalition\u2019s policy agenda is to be achieved within the framework of a return to budget surplus and a stabilisation of government debt. For Labor, the change in the leadership of the government will focus its policy agenda ahead of the election. While it has boldly outlined a series of policy proposals on superannuation, the environment and broader social issues, it too needs to be alert to the cynicism of the electorate especially in a climate where national income growth is likely to remain subdued in the near term and where real household income growth is falling. One can only hope that the demise of arguably the most economically damaging prime minister and treasurer in living memory will sharpen the overall policy debate from all sides of politics and lead to better policy and therefore economic outcomes over the years ahead. Perhaps there can be a discussion of industry policy, industrial relations, tax, housing affordability, aged care, retirements incomes \u2013 to name a few \u2013 without there being some glib Abbottesque comeback. Australia is in its 25th year without a recession. It is still a rich and vibrant economy, even though it has significantly underperformed its peers in the last two years. To get back to the pack, let alone over take it and become world-best in the economic space as it was previously, some changes are needed soon and, depending on global economic conditions, perhaps urgently. It is to be hoped the new Turnbull team can deliver better economic policy and therefore outcomes in the near term because 2% GDP growth, 15 straight months with unemployment at 6% and higher, falling real wages and budget ineptitude are not acceptable. The Coalition\u2019s current policies more or less guarantee low performance for the next few years. This is a critical reason why Abbott and Hockey were so disliked and why Turnbull has a chance to change things. But he needs to act quickly. The next election is just a year away and unless the economy improves he will be swept away by an electorate facing genuine financial stresses for the first time in several decades.

While it has boldly outlined a series of policy proposals on superannuation, the environment and broader social issues, it too needs to be alert to the cynicism of the electorate especially in a climate where national income growth is likely to remain subdued in the near term and where real household income growth is falling.</p> <p>One can only hope that the demise of arguably the most economically damaging prime minister and treasurer in living memory will sharpen the overall policy debate from all sides of politics and lead to better policy and therefore economic outcomes over the years ahead.<br></p> <p>Perhaps there can be a discussion of industry policy, industrial relations, tax, housing affordability, aged care, retirements incomes \u2013 to name a few \u2013 without there being some glib Abbottesque comeback.</p> <p>Australia is in its 25<sup>th</sup> year without a recession. It is still a rich and vibrant economy, even though it has significantly underperformed its peers in the last two years. To get back to the pack, let alone over take it and become world-best in the economic space as it was previously, some changes are needed soon and, depending on global economic conditions, perhaps urgently.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2015/sep/02/economic-management-is-now-tony-abbotts-weakest-claim-to-re-election\">Economic management is now Tony Abbott's weakest claim to re-election | Stephen Koukoulas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is to be hoped the new Turnbull team can deliver better economic policy and therefore outcomes in the near term because 2% GDP growth, 15 straight months with unemployment at 6% and higher, falling real wages and budget ineptitude are not acceptable.<br></p> <p>The Coalition\u2019s current policies more or less guarantee low performance for the next few years. This is a critical reason why Abbott and Hockey were so disliked and why Turnbull has a chance to change things. But he needs to act quickly.

      "bodyText": "Sharp falls in petrol prices are expected to have pulled UK inflation back down to zero in August, economists predict ahead of the latest official figures today. Financial markets will be looking to inflation data at 9.30am for clues as to when the Bank of England will start raising interest rates after more than six years at their record low of 0.5%. The US Federal Reserve is expected, by a slim majority of economists, to hike its main interest rate this week, but experts believe the UK\u2019s central bank will wait until at least the end of the year to follow suit. If forecasters are right about August inflation in the UK, that could ease the pressure on the Bank of England to start raising borrowing costs. The headline inflation rate is forecast to edge down to zero for August from 0.1% in July, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll of economists. Some even see inflation on the consumer prices index (CPI) measure turning negative again after a sharp fall in crude oil prices and a supermarket price war cut the cost of petrol and diesel. \u201cOur forecast for August is that the headline measure of CPI inflation fell back to 0.0%, but there is a significant risk that it heads back into negative territory,\u201d said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec. Oil has more than halved from its $115-a-barrel peak last summer to under $50 now. Last week, investment bank Goldman Sachs said it could tumble even further to as low as $20. Some of that has been passed on to motorists and unleaded petrol dropped 2.4p to 114.8p a litre in August, according to the AA. Diesel fell 7.4p to 111.9p a litre, making it cheaper than petrol for the first time since 2001, the drivers\u2019 lobby group added. Economists say that the relatively strong pound will also have helped keep the price of imported food low and that there may also have been some downward pressure on inflation from summer clothing discounts last month. That could nudge down inflation to -0.1% or even -0.2%, they say, marking a return to the negative territory hit in April this year when prices fell for the first time in more than 50 years. That flirtation with negative inflation was only brief, and prices were rising again in May, albeit by just 0.1% on the year. Hugging zero Inflation, which is measured by tracking the price of a basket of goods and services, has been hovering around zero since the start of the year, well below the Bank\u2019s 2% target. But governor Mark Carney has warned households to start preparing for a rate rise from the current 0.5%. One of the nine-member committee that sets policy at the Bank, Ian McCafferty, voted for a rate hike last week. Policymakers have also sought to play down fears the UK is on the brink of all-out deflation, where falling prices persist. With currency moves and volatile financial markets buffeting food and energy prices, the Bank will be looking to the so-called core rate of inflation in Tuesday\u2019s figures for guidance. That measure, which strips out food, energy, alcohol and tobacco, picked up markedly in July\u2019s figures. It rose to 1.2% from 0.8% in June, the highest for five months. Policymakers will also be scrutinising the latest official pay growth figures due out on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect that pay growth picked up to 2.5% in the three months to July, or to 2.9% when stripping out bonuses. That compares with 2.4% and 2.8%, reported for the three months to June, respectively. \u201cHow earnings develop over the coming months will play a crucial role in just when the Bank of England starts to raise interest rates,\u201d said Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight. \u201cShould earnings growth pick up markedly over the coming months, it would increase the likelihood that the Bank of England will raise interest rates early on in 2016.\u201d",
