      "bodyText": "Former top bankers at HBOS are expected to face stinging criticism of their management of the bank before it was rescued by Lloyds and bailed out with \u00a320bn of taxpayers' money. The banking standards commission, which took evidence from former executives at the bank, will publish its report into HBOS in which it describes the near collapse of the bank in 2008 as \"an accident waiting to happen\". The commission will issue the first detailed account of what went wrong at HBOS, which was created through the 2001 merger of Halifax and Bank of Scotland, before it was rescued by Lloyds in September 2008. In a series of compelling evidence sessions, the commission forced Sir James Crosby, a former HBOS chief executive, to concede that he was \"incompetent\" after the bank incurred \u00a326bn of losses from its corporate lending in the runup to the 2008 crisis. Crosby was chief executive of HBOS until 2006 when he was replaced by Andy Hornby, who was at the helm when the Lloyds rescue was brokered. The commission accused Lord Stevenson, the chairman at the time of the rescue, of being \"delusional\" and living in \"cloud cuckoo land\". Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the commission, set up to review the culture of banks after the Libor scandal, told Stevenson that he believed he was \"delusional rather than mendacious\" as he accused the peer of being \"evasive, repetitive and unrealistic\". The commission is expected to explore why Peter Cummings, the long-standing Bank of Scotland banker who ran the corporate bank at the time of the rescue, was the only senior figure to be banned from the City by the Financial Services Authority. Cummings, who gave evidence to the commission in private, was also fined \u00a3500,000 by the now defunct regulator.

In a deal worth \u00a3105.4m, the Pru's real-estate management arm, Prupim, is buying a portfolio of 534 private rental units from upmarket housebuilder Berkeley.

Now, for the first time, some of these directors will have to answer for their actions in a British court.\" The group said its claim was lodged in London's high court today . The group claimed that, \"in essence, the directors created a false market for RBS shares to raise the \u00a312bn required to shore up the balance sheet\". The group has previously said that any private or institutional shareholder who signed up for shares in the rights issue was eligible to join its ranks, and that Philip Marshall QC of Serle Court chambers was acting as its leading counsel. Simon Hart, banking litigation partner at City law firm RPC, said: \"This is one of the largest shareholder actions we have seen brought against the UK banks. These type of actions are by their nature relatively rare but have been borne directly out of the unprecedented upheavals in the banking industry in 2008.\" Law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, which is acting for RBS, declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has demanded that Cyprus cut state pension costs and reform its welfare system as the price of a \u20ac1bn (\u00a3854m) loan to help bail out the stricken island. The IMF's managing director, Christine Lagarde, said the poorest Cypriots would be protected from the worst of the cuts, but Cyprus must press ahead with measures to bring its annual state budget into surplus by 2018. The deal, agreed in principle by the Cypriot government, provoked an immediate reaction from trade unions, which called on bank workers to strike over potential pension cuts. Officials from the Cyprus Union of Bank Employees called on bank staff in Nicosia to walk off their jobs at lunchtime on Thursday, and gather in a protest march towards the parliament. Underlining the sense of panic, the Cypriot central bank was reportedly preparing to extend capital controls to prevent a run on the banks despite previously lifting some more draconian elements earlier in the week. The statement by Lagarde followed confirmation that the IMF will provide one-tenth of a \u20ac10bn bailout loan, leaving the European Union and the European Central Bank to pick up the remaining \u20ac9bn tab. Cyprus needs the money to refinance its stricken banking sector and reduce government debts that were on course to reach 180% of GDP. The crisis brought Cyprus to the brink of collapse after it was in effect locked out of private markets and forced to seek funds from the EU and IMF. The Cypriot president, Nicos Anastasiades, has struggled to bring the situation under control after a series of mishaps that included imposing a tax on bank deposits of less than \u20ac100,000 \u2013 protected under EU guarantees \u2013 which was later reversed. The three-year IMF loan was secured against a series of reforms agreed by the government two weeks ago that involved shutting the island's second largest bank, Laiki, and restructuring the biggest lender, Bank of Cyprus. A tax on bank deposits of more than \u20ac100,000 was also put in place to raise \u20ac5.8bn from domestic funds, amid reports that the haircut could be between 40% and 80% of deposits. In addition, public sector cuts and tax rises already under way are estimated to save around 5% of GDP. The IMF said further measures amounting to an additional 2% of GDP will be needed by raising the corporate income tax rate from 10% to 12.5% and the tax rate on interest income from 15% to 30%. Cuts in pensions and welfare benefits will bring savings worth another 4.5% of GDP in the medium term \"to achieve a 4% of GDP primary surplus by 2018, which is required to put debt on a firmly downward path\". It said the social welfare system will be reviewed to \"streamline administration costs\", minimise the overlap of existing programs, and improve their targeting to ensure that public resources \"reach those in need\". Lagarde said: \"A combined financing package of \u20ac10bn is designed to help Cyprus cover its financing needs, including to service debt obligations, while it implements the policies needed to restore the health of the economy and regain access to capital market financing.\"",

These are the conclusions of the 244-page report into the business practices at Barclays conducted by the City lawyer Anthony Salz.

      "bodyText": "The auditor of the company behind Harlequin Property, the Caribbean luxury property developer that has accused Panorama of \"improper behaviour\", has resigned after less than three years in office. In a Companies House filing BDO said it was resigning as auditor of Harlequin Management Services (South East) [HMS] because of a breakdown in communication. \"Following our disclaimer of audit opinion in relation to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2011 and our report of significant audit findings to the directors we have not been given sufficient information by the directors to enable us to ascertain whether or not appropriate progress has been made in relation to those findings,\" said BDO. So serious were the problems with the 2011 accounts for HMS, the main agent for Harlequin's overseas companies, that BDO took the unusual step of saying: \"Because of the significance of the matters \u2026 we have not been able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for an audit opinion. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the financial statements.\" Last week Harlequin accused a BBC Panorama producer of \"highly improper\" behaviour and attempting to bribe a consultant to disclose sensitive information about the company. A Panorama episode about the company, which has received millions of pounds of investors' money for homes that have yet to be built, was pulled. In a statement last week Panorama said: \"In light of information received late in the production process of this film the BBC decided to postpone broadcast. We are currently reviewing the facts. As a result a member of the team has been suspended and a disciplinary procedure is under way.\" Harlequin denied that the \"effective two way communications\" which BDO said was \"a prerequisite for an effective audit\" had broken down. \"Harlequin understands the form suggests a lack of communication from Harlequin. Harlequin denies this as its accountants were communicating with BDO in relation to the work undertaken to address the issues raised in the audit. We haven't appointed a replacement for BDO yet and do not have to do so for some months to comply with our statutory duties. We are considering various firms for the role and will make an announcement in due course,\" a spokesman for the company said. Investors in the 5,000 properties Harlequin has sold are keen to learn of the company's financial progress. Only a fraction of the properties have been completed and the Merricks resort in Barbados, where more than 1,200 properties are to be built, has still to secure planning permission for full development.

      "bodyText": "Meanwhile, back in Cyprus the government has been crowing about the terms of the new memorandum of understanding it has signed with international creditors. Helena Smith writes: Good news may be hard to find in Cyprus these days but president Nicos Anastasiades\u2019 government went out of its way today to put a positive spin on the \u20ac10bn bailout programme it has finally wrapped up with the EU, ECB and IMF. Speaking to reporters, the government spokesman Christos Stylianides described the deal as being a great deal \u201cbetter\u201d that the draft agreement previously reached under the former president and veteran communist Demetris Christofias. \u2028\u201cThis is a very important development which ends a very long period of uncertainty,\u201d Stylianides said of the programme, negotiated with troika officials by outgoing finance minister Michalis Sarris. Under the deal, which must now be ratified by all 27 EU parliaments, Cyprus will be able to repay the \u20ac10bn loan at the much more competitive interest rate of between 2.5% and 2.7% rather than the 4.5% secured by the Christofias government for a \u20ac2.5bn loan from Russia. In addition, said Stylianides, the agreement -- Sarris\u2019 last act before leaving office \u2013 foresees the island\u2019s fiscal adjustment period being prolonged by two years thus allowing more wiggle space for the government to reach a primary surplus by 2018. With austerity the name of the game, the Troika have also insisted that all government officials \u2013 with the exception of the president and House speaker \u2013 be banned from flying business class when they make trips abroad (the restriction will be lifted on transatlantic flights). And with that, it's time to shut up shop for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow. It's been a down day for stock markets, with the continuing concerns about Cyprus and Portugal as well as some disappointing US data dampening sentiment. Investors remained cautious ahead of the Bank of England and European Central Bank meetings on Thursday, not to mention the US non-farm payroll numbers due on Friday. Toby Morris, senior sales trader at CMC Markets UK, said: An early correction in European equities has deepened this afternoon as the market\u2019s failure to push on past recent psychological levels sparked a round of profit taking, pushing the major indices lower. \u2022 The FTSE 100 fell 70.38 points to 6420.28, down 1.08% \u2022 Germany's Dax was down 0.87% \u2022 France's Cac closed 1.32% lower \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB lost 2.28% \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 1.81% lower \u2022 Portugal's PSI 20 dropped 3.54% \u2022 The Athens market fell 2.16% In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down nearly 60% or 0.39%. Reports are emerging that Cyprus will extend its capital controls for another 7 days. Despite the likelihood of the no-confidence vote in Portugal failing, it has certainly focused attention again on the country's troubles. The PSI 20 index is down 4%, making it the worst European market performer of the day, with banks among the fallers. Not surprising, given what happened in Cyprus and the knock-on effect of that on the eurozone financial sector. There is also the small matter of the constitutional court which has been examining this year's budget since January and is expected to give its ruling on the legality of the plans in the coming weeks. Opposition parties argued that planned cuts to pensions, salaries and welfare benefits undermined workers' basic rights. Portugal's opposition party has called for a renegotiation of the country's EU/IMF bailout package and labelled the government an \"incompetent\" one which must be replaced. Socialist leader Antonio Jose Seguro, presenting a largely symbolic no confidence motion, said his party was against the spending cuts the government agreed to. He said (as reported by Reuters): Your government is destroying Portugal and there is only one solution - to replace the incompetent government. But the prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho, whose centre-right coalition has a comfortable majority, said the country had to comply with the programme to guarantee funding, and the no-confidence vote created a climate of political instability. He said a bailout renegotiation would lead to a second bailout. The weaker than expected jobs data out from the US today could mean analysts are being too optimistic about Friday's non-farm payroll numbers, suggested James Knightley at ING. He said: The employment component [of the ISM non-manufacturing survey] dropped to 53.3 from 57.2. Given today\u2019s ADP payrolls survey also showed a slowdown in private sector hiring to 158,000 from 237,000 in February this perhaps indicates some downside risk to the consensus forecast of non-farm payrolls rising 198,000 on Friday. With ongoing concerns about the potential economic impact from sequestration we suspect that we are going to see a softer period of activity data. As such we doubt that the Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative easing plans will be scaled back before the third quarter of 2013. It may count as stating the obvious but the head of Greece's biggest business group reckons the Cypriot crisis could tip his country into an even deeper recession this year. He also called for the troika of international lenders, due in Greece this week, to rethink the bailout programme by promoting growth measures as well as austerity. From Reuters: \"Greece is directly affected by the Cyprus crisis and based on some estimates this may chop up to one percentage point off GDP (gross domestic product),\" Dimitris Daskalopoulos, head of the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises (SEB), told reporters. \"With the success of the Greek bailout programme already hanging by a thread, many signs show the recession is deepening with the prospect of recovery in 2014 fading,\" Daskalopoulos said. He said the insistence on austerity by the eurozone's core to cure the ills of the debt crisis risked breeding euro scepticism and anti-German sentiment among the suffering countries of the single currency bloc. \"The North must give and the South must change, otherwise the historic demons of Europe will find again room to act.\" He said the protracted economic downturn and fiscal austerity were testing society's tolerance limits and called on the government and its international lenders to retool the applied programme with growth measures. \"The bell of reforms must finally ring loudly in Greece,\" Daskalopoulos said. \"We cannot be fighting tooth and nail against firing a few thousand public sector workers when almost one million people have lost their jobs in the private sector.\" The latest US services data has come in a little weaker than expected, which has done little to perk up markets. The Intitute for Supply Management reported the non-manufacturing index fell to 54.4 in March, compared to 56 in February and expectations of a figure of 55.8. This is the lowest figure since August. Ahead of the non-farm payroll numbers on Friday, the employment component of the index fell from 57.2 to 53.3, the weakest since November. As a result the Dow Jones Industrial Average, down around 11 points earlier, has now fallen 40 points. Over in Austria, the country's constitutional court had thrown out a challenge against the ratification of the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund. AP writes: The court said on Wednesday that case, filed by the former right-wing state government in the province of Carinthia, was unfounded. That government lost a state election earlier this year. The \u20ac500bn ESM started work late last year. Austria is one of the 17-nation eurozone's more prosperous countries and bailing out eurozone strugglers has not been popular there. The court found that Austria's government and Parliament acted within the country's constitution in approving the fund and that there was no improper transfer of sovereignty. Quick look at the markets... UK FTSE 100: down 0.4%, 29 points, at 6462 France CAC 40: down 0.2% Germany DAX: down 0.05% Spain IBEX: down 0.7% Italy FTSE MIB: down 1.1% And with that I will hand over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. In the UK, banks' appetite for lending to individuals grew in the first three months of 2013, but the availability of loans to small and medium businesses remained restricted, according to the Bank of England's latest credit conditions survey. My colleague Hilary Osborne writes: Lenders reported an increase in the overall availability of secured credit to households for the third consecutive quarter, citing attempts to increase their market share as the main reason for offering more loans. An increased appetite for risk, and a fall in the cost of providing mortgages, helped by the government's Funding for Lending scheme, also contributed. The government's Funding for Lending scheme, introduced in August 2012, has reduced costs for lenders by offering cheap funding to banks and building societies. It was designed to boost lending to householders and businesses, but the Bank's survey suggests that small and medium companies may still be struggling to raise funds. Leo Ringer, CBI head of financial services, said: It is encouraging that the cost of finance for small businesses fell in the first quarter for the first time in more than three years. This indicates that the Funding for Lending Scheme is starting to make an impact on business lending as well as in the housing market, which chimes with what firms are telling us. However, the sharp fall in demand for finance from small businesses is a timely reminder that the flow of credit is a two-way street. Lending flows will only improve materially when there is a significant pick-up in business confidence and demand. In Cyprus, bank workers are set to stage a strike tomorrow, saying that the pensions of its members at the island's two largest banks have not been protected. The bank workers' union, ETYK, said the pension funds of workers in Laiki Bank, which is being wound down, and Bank of Cyprus, which will be severely restructured, were at risk. It has called a two-hour work stoppage between 12.30 and 2.30pm local time, followed by a march to parliament. The eurozone crisis is having far-reaching effects, not least on the aid being sent to the developing world. Our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: Deep cuts in aid budgets by crisis-stricken euro zone countries have prompted the biggest fall in development assistance to the world\u2019s poorest nations since the mid-1990s. Sharp drops in spending by Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal resulted in a 4% decline in financial assistance to the developing world in 2012, according to the annual assessment conducted by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD, a club for 33 rich nations, said it was concerned by the decline, which it blamed on the austerity programmes forced on many euro zone countries over the past three years. After a 2% drop in 2011, the decline in 2012 was the biggest in 15 years and was the first back-to-back drop in development assistance since 1996-97 - the years immediately before the mass public campaigns in the West for debt relief and increased development assistance. US jobs numbers for March fell well short of expectations, suggesting the improvement in the jobs market could be stalling. Private sector employers added 158,000 jobs in March, compared with forecasts of 200,000 new jobs in the ADP national employment report. Moody's economist Mark Zandi said: I'm very optimistic about the economy but I think the next six months are going to be pretty tricky and we're going to see that in the job market. So I think we actually will see weaker jobs numbers in the next few months. February's figure was revised up to an increase of 237,000 from the previously reported 198,000. Over to Italy, where the treasury has cut its growth expectations, just two weeks after the last forecasts. Treasury undersecretary Gianfranco Polillo said the economy is likely to contract by 1.5% and 1.6% this year. Speaking to Radio 24, he said: This year we will see a fall in gross domestic product of 1.3% if things go well, but it will probably be -1.5% or -1.6%. The currency bloc's third largest economy has shrunk for six consecutive quarters, its longest recession in 20 years. Mario Monti's outgoing government slashed this year's forecast to -1.3% last moth from its previous estimate of -0.2%. Cyprus's new finance minister has taken on his first task and has (essentially) said he will do what he is told. Harris Georgiades said the island state is committed to meeting all the terms of a \u20ac10bn bailout deal agreed with the troika of the EC, the ECB and the IMF last week. We shall implement the [memorandum of understanding] fully, and without any derogations. We shall meet all timeframes, we will meet all targets. Earlier today a spokesman for the German finance ministry said they expect the Cypriot memorandum of understanding to be ready by April 9. Germany's bond sale went well today, with five year borrowing costs dropping to their lowest level since August. The sale of the five-year bonds came at a yield \u2013 effectively the interest rate \u2013 of 0.33%. Reuters reports: German yields have fallen back close to their lowest ever levels over the past two months as concerns about inconclusive Italian elections and an unprecedented levy on bank depositors in Cyprus have pushed investors towards safe-haven assets. Those concerns helped support the sale, which drew bids worth 1.9 times the amount allocated to investors - a measure of demand which was in line with previous sales this year. Olli Rehn, the vice president of the European Commission and IMF chief Christine Lagarde have now put out a statement hailing the agreement for the Cyprus bailout. They say: While the Cypriot government has already adopted important fiscal consolidation measures, the programme entails a well-paced fiscal adjustment that balances short-run cyclical concerns and long-run sustainability objectives, while protecting vulnerable groups. The social welfare system will be reviewed with the view to ensuring sustainability and social fairness. The programme puts forward comprehensive structural reforms to set the conditions for growth and job creation. Significant challenges lie ahead for Cyprus. The European Commission and the International Monetary Fund stand by Cyprus and the Cypriot people in helping to restore financial stability, fiscal sustainability and growth to the country and its people. Rehn is due to fly to Athens tomorrow, as part of the troika mission to resume its latest inspection of Greek public finances and check on the progress of structural reforms. Spanish president Mariano Rajoy has said the Spanish will start to see the results of the sacrifices made under austerity, next year. Speaking in a closed session, which was broadcast live on TV, he said: In 2014 Spain will show clear growth and we will start to create jobs. The Spanish people will start to see the tangible results of the efforts they have made. He admitted that this year \"will be hard\". His comments were met with some scepticism. He said the country had already seen results from its labours, but they had not yet reached the real economy. It is not that we have not got any results, we have, they are good and promising, but they have not reached the Spanish people. This is the thanklessness of this task. But we have avoided the worst, [in avoiding] two bailouts. Italy's parliament will start voting for a new president to replace Giorgio Napolitano on April 18, the speaker of the lower house said today. Napolitano has made little headway in breaking a political deadlock wince last month's inconclusive elections. His seven-year term ends in mid-May and it is likely that the next president will inherit the impasse. Here's Howard Archer on the Bank of England decision... Interest rates completed a fourth year at 0.50% in March, and the strong likelihood is that they will stay there through the rest of 2013 and 2014 as well. If interest rates were to move any time soon it would be downwards, but we suspect that the Bank of England will retain the view that lower interest rates may not be beneficial overall for the economy. Instead, he says, the question is whether the bank expands its programme of pumping money into the economy, via quantitative easing. With the economy at risk of having suffered further GDP contraction in the first quarter of 2012, it looks to be a knife edge decision as to whether the MPC go for another \u00a325 billion of Quantitative Easing on Thursday. It could even come down to the strength or otherwise of the purchasing managers survey for the dominant services sector in March (which is out on Thursday morning). A reasonably decent survey would ease concerns that the economy contracted in the first quarter and would perhaps give the MPC some more breathing space. A poor services survey, coming on top of the largely disappointing manufacturing and construction surveys, would exert significant late pressure on the MPC to give the economy a further helping hand with more QE. Whether this happens on Thursday or not, Archer expects the bank to deliver one \u00a325bn slug of QE in the second quarter (taking the stock up to \u00a3400bn) with another \u00a325bn shortly after Mark Carney takes over as Bank of England governor in July. Easing inflation in the eurozone does leave the European Central Bank scope to cut interest rates at its meeting tomorrow. (Central banks cite rising prices as one of the key dangers of cutting rates or pumping money into the economy). But analysts say it will probably hold fire, for the time being, at least. Analysts at investment bank ING say: Choosing a rather ineffective but politically acceptable rate cut or an effective but politically controversial lending bazooka. At tomorrow\u2019s meeting, rates should remain on hold but if the recovery fails to unfold, the ECB will eventually have to choose Here's Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Some governing council members did favour an interest rate cut in March, and we suspect that likely ongoing disappointing Eurozone economic news will increasingly prod the ECB towards acting within the next few months. We suspect that the ECB will eventually take interest rates down from 0.75% to 0.50%, very possibly around June. The Bank of England also announces the outcome of its monthly rate-setting meeting tomorrow. ING says it too is likely to keep policy unchanged this week, but three members of the committee, including the governor, will continue to push for more stimulus. Eurozone inflation has eased from 1.8% to 1.7%, the lowest rate since August 2010. The drop was driven by a sharp fall in energy inflation, though this was partially offset by rising prices of core goods and services Capital Economics said: These [latter] increases might fuel speculation that underlying price pressures in the currency union are starting to pick back up again, perhaps in response to faster wages growth in some countries and the inflationary effects of the recent falls in the euro. But we think that would be a premature conclusion. Wage pressures remain generally subdued and the euro\u2019s previous strength should continue to push import prices down for some time yet. Our guess, therefore, is that these are blips and that core inflation will continue to ease over the coming months, pushing the headline rate further below the ECB\u2019s 2% \u201cceiling\u201d. Unfortunately, though, this looks unlikely to prompt the central bank to provide further policy support. The IMF will contribute \u20ac1bn over three years to the \u20ac10bn bailout agreed with Cyprus. The fund has also put out more details of the terms of the bailout, which look (predictably) punishing. In a prepared statement, Lagarde starts by suggesting that austerity measures for 2013-2015, introduced with this year's budget, mean there is little need for additional measures in the short-term. But, she goes on to say these measures will achieve savings worth just 5% of GDP. The IMF says Cyprus must more than double those savings, if it is to achieve its goal of a 4% GDP surplus in 2018 (which it needs to start paying down its debt). Among other things, the fund suggests Cyprus doubles the tax on income from savings to 30% (as if Cypriot savers had not been punished enough). And the government should also raise the corporate income tax rate from 10% to 12.5%. Lagarde said: There will be protection for the most vulnerable groups. The social welfare system will be reviewed to streamline administration costs, minimize the overlap of existing programs, and improve their targeting to ensure that public resources reach those in need. Some instant reaction from Twitter... UK construction figures are in and they look bad, with the sector contracting for the third month running in March. The construction PMI inched up to 47.2 from 46.8 in February, but remains below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Markit said that unusually cold weather combined with sluggish underlying demand kept a lid on building work in March. The danger is that construction will act as a drag on GDP in the first quarter. Tim Moore at Markit said: The negative print for construction output mirrors that seen for manufacturing, and now leaves the service sector as the last great hope for avoiding another slide in UK GDP. If the economy contracts in the first quarter, Britain will slide into a triple-dip recession, which will be a huge blow to the chancellor. Sterling dropped on the data to around $1.5093, from $1.5116 before the release. Over to Cyprus, where the new finance minister Harris Georgiades was sworn in this morning. He takes over from Michael Sarris who resigned yesterday, after a probe was launched into how the island was pushed to the verge of bankruptcy. Sarris said his previous role as chairman of Laiki, the country's second largest bank which is being wound down, was likely to be subject to scrutiny, as part of the investigation. President Nicos Anastasiades warned him this morning of the \"difficult days ahead.\" He said at the swearing in ceremony that they would require... Firstly, collectivity and, secondly, consistency and fiscal discipline and all those measures that will contribute to kick-starting the economy as soon as possible. I have no doubt that you will not only accomplish your task to the full, but in the best way possible that is worthy of your predecessor. Charlie Charalambous at AFP reports: Georgiades, a 40-year-old economist who had been labour minister, formally took up his new post a day after Michalis Sarris said he was stepping down to cooperate with judges investigating the failure of Laiki Bank, where he was chairman for much of last year. The bank's collapse was a major contributor to the island's near financial meltdown and need for a crippling eurozone bailout. Also sworn in on Wednesday was Zeta Emilianidou, permanent secretary at the commerce ministry, who becomes the first woman in the Anastasiades cabinet, taking over from Georgiades at the labour ministry. The Cahuzac scandal (see 8.52am) has shaken the French public's faith in politicians even further, and there are fears that this distrust could fuel a rise in the popularity of the far-right party, the Front National. It comes at a particularly bad time for the socialist government, coinciding with the questioning of one of its senators, as part of a separate investigation into the misuse of public funds. The opposition, meanwhile, has been rocked with scandal and last week, former president Nicolas Sarkozy was placed under formal investigation on suspicion that he received illegal campaign donations from France\u2019s richest woman, Liliane Bettencourt. Sarkozy denies the allegation. The far-right party of Marine Le Pen portrays both main parties as equally corrupt and is likely to benefit from the escalating distrust of politicians. Front National vice president Florian Philippot said yesterday: This is another example of the decay of the political system that is in power, and which must now leave. In France, economy minister Pierre Moscovici has been forced to deny any part in covering up the scandal engulfing former budget minister Pierre Cahuzac. For a recap of that story, David Chazan writes in The Times this morning: Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the beleaguered French President, suffered a severe blow yesterday when his former budget minister, who is under investigation for tax fraud, admitted holding illegal offshore bank accounts. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cahuzac, who resigned last month, confessed to investigating judges that he had held about \u20ac600,000 in an undisclosed foreign account for the past 20 years. It is alleged that he held several Swiss bank accounts and transferred funds to Singapore. Failing to disclose such arrangements is illegal in France. The development is deeply embarrassing for Mr Hollande, who came to power last year vowing that his Socialist government would mark a break with the scandals that tainted the administration of his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy. Until yesterday, Mr Cahuzac, 60, a former plastic surgeon who has led a crackdown on tax dodgers, had continued to proclaim his innocence, even after resigning from the Government. This morning, Moscovici defended the government, which had given Cahuzac its full backing. He said on RTL: The president of the republic, the prime minister and myself, we did what needed to be done. There was no complacency, no desire to obstruct justice, no desire to whitewash or cover it up. Focus shifts to Lisbon again today, with a no-confidence vote in the government of prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho. The debate kicks off at 4pm. This is the fourth time Portuguese politicians have attempted to oust the current government \u2013 which is pushing through unpopular austerity measures in exchange for a eurozone bailout \u2013 but the first that is supported by all the left-wing opposition. Meanwhile, the courts in Portugal are debating the constitutionality of some of the austerity measures. Passos Coelho said last week he would resign if the court rules against them, forcing him to revise the 2013 budget. But he was forced to backtrack when he was accused of placing undue pressure on the courts. He said: I will not speculate or create expectations around possible [court] decisions. I won't contribute to instability. Whatever his motives, it is thought the move may have backfired as the courts will be more inclined to demonstrate their independence from the executive following the headlines. A quick look at the data coming up. In the UK, we've got construction figures for March and there is an estimate of inflation from the eurozone. UK construction PMI (March): 9.30am Eurozone CPI estimate (March): 10am EU's Barroso and Czech leader Zeman speak: 10.45am Bank of England's Andy Haldane speaks: 11am US ADP employment change (March): 1.15pm Italian PM Monti and economy inister Grilli meet: 2pm US ISM non-manufacturing (March): 3pm In the debt markets, Germany is selling \u20ac4bn of five year bonds. (Thanks to Ransquawk for the data). Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis and other developments in the global economy. Later today, the Portuguese government of Pedro Passos Coelho will face its fourth no-confidence vote. The government is expected to survive but the challenge has buried any hope of consensus between the two main parties in a country, mired in recession and crippled by austerity imposed by its international lenders. Cyrpus will swear in its new finance minister and there may be further developments in France, after former budget minister J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cahuzac admitted to holding a secret Swiss bank account.",

Speaking to reporters, the government spokesman Christos Stylianides described the deal as being a great deal \u201cbetter\u201d that the draft agreement previously reached under the former president and veteran communist Demetris Christofias.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2028\u201cThis is a very important development which ends a very long period of uncertainty,\u201d Stylianides said of the programme, negotiated with troika officials by outgoing finance minister Michalis Sarris. Under the deal, which must now be ratified by all 27 EU parliaments, Cyprus will be able to repay the \u20ac10bn loan at the much more competitive interest rate of between 2.5% and 2.7% rather than the 4.5% secured by the Christofias government for a \u20ac2.5bn loan from Russia.</p> <p>In addition, said Stylianides, the agreement -- Sarris\u2019 last act before leaving office \u2013 foresees the island\u2019s fiscal adjustment period being prolonged by two years thus allowing more wiggle space for the government to reach a primary surplus by 2018.</p> <p>With austerity the name of the game, the Troika have also insisted that all government officials \u2013 with the exception of the president and House speaker \u2013 be banned from flying business class when they make trips abroad (the restriction will be lifted on transatlantic flights).&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <p>And with that, it's time to shut up shop for the evening.

He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will not speculate or create expectations around possible [court] decisions. I won't contribute to instability.</p> </blockquote> <p>Whatever his motives, it is thought the move may have backfired as the courts will be more inclined to demonstrate their independence from the executive following the headlines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-445ce098-a172-432b-a82f-c9ad9ddf8e7a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/3/1364974286269/32840c97-791c-4647-9586-ad348909416a-460x320.jpeg\" alt=\"More protests against the government in Portugal.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Deep cuts in aid budgets by crisis-stricken eurozone countries have prompted the biggest fall in development assistance to the world's poorest nations since the mid-1990s. Sharp drops in spending by Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal resulted in a 4% decline in financial assistance to the developing world in 2012, according to the annual assessment conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD, a club for 33 rich nations, said it was concerned by the decline, which it blamed on the austerity programmes forced on many eurozone countries over the past three years. After a 2% drop in 2011, the decline in 2012 was the biggest in 15 years and was the first back-to-back drop in development assistance since 1996-97 \u2013 the years immediately before the mass public campaigns in the west for debt relief and increased development assistance. \"It is worrying that budgetary duress in our member countries has led to a second successive fall in total aid, but I take heart from the fact that, in spite of the crisis, nine countries still managed to increase their aid,\" said Angel Gurr\u00eda, the OECD's secretary general. \"As we approach the 2015 deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (UN targets that include halving global poverty, universal primary education and cutting infant mortality), I hope that the trend in aid away from the poorest countries will be reversed. This is essential if aid is to play its part in helping achieve the goals.\" The OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) said that western aid in 2012 stood at $125.7bn (\u00a383bn), and urged member states to live up to their pledges to the world's poor. Spain cut its aid budget by 50%, Italy by 35%, Greece by 17% and Portugal by 13% as the single currency suffered its most severe crisis since monetary union was founded in 1999. But other big donors \u2013 including the United States, Japan and the UK \u2013 also reported small falls in aid spending in 2012. Bilateral aid to sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 the world's poorest region \u2013 dropped by 8% in 2012, while assistance to the least developed countries (LDCs) was down by 13%. The new chairman of the DAC, Erik Solheim, singled out the UK \u2013 which will increase its aid spending by more than 30% this year \u2013 as an example of how it was possible to increase financial assistance to poor countries even when there was pressure to reduce budget deficits. \"I welcome the efforts of those nine DAC members that increased their aid in 2012, and urge others to increase their aid as soon as their budget circumstances allow,\" said Solheim. \"Maintaining aid is not impossible even in today's fiscal climate. The UK's 2013-14 budget increases its aid to 0.7% of national income, which gives hope that we can reverse the falling trend.\" Countries increasing their aid budgets in 2012 included Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Iceland, Poland, Turkey and South Korea. Oxfam's head of development finance and public services, Emma Seery, said: \"The UK government has shown it is possible to keep aid promises even in the toughest economic times. Political will is crucial, especially as it is now clear that the eurozone crisis is having a devastating knock-on effect on some of the world's poorest people.\"",

We expect international and online revenues to both record around 30% revenue compound annual growth rates between 2012 and 2015, and combined to account for over half of group sales by 2015, from just 11% in 2008. The brand appeal is strong, and more global than most appreciate. We initiate with an 843p target price and buy recommendation. </blockquote> <p>She also pointed to a \"revitalised\" senior management team:</p> <blockquote> Chief financial officer Shaun Wills and chief operating officer Susanne Given are now nearing the end of their first year. The team has been revitalised and now has the capacity to support sustainable and profitable growth. A head of international should be appointed soon; this is a key piece of news in our view. </blockquote> <p>SuperGroup shares are currently 32p higher at 637.5p.

Analyst Caroline Gulliver said:</p> <blockquote> Recent bid speculation and the market rally has pushed M&amp;S's share price to the top of its 360p-400p trading range. We think this is unjustified and weak fourth quarter current trading will lead to a correction. We anticipate that cold weather has led to both declining clothing sales and gross margin investment and thus we have lowered our 2013 pretax profit estimate by 3% to \u00a3640m. Looking ahead to 2014 we forecast only 2.5% profit growth and so trading on 11.9 times our calendarised 2013 earnings per share estimate, we reiterate our sell recommendation. </blockquote>",

We expect international and online revenues to both record around 30% revenue compound annual growth rates between 2012 and 2015, and combined to account for over half of group sales by 2015, from just 11% in 2008. The brand appeal is strong, and more global than most appreciate. We initiate with an 843p target price and buy recommendation. She also pointed to a \"revitalised\" senior management team: Chief financial officer Shaun Wills and chief operating officer Susanne Given are now nearing the end of their first year. The team has been revitalised and now has the capacity to support sustainable and profitable growth. A head of international should be appointed soon; this is a key piece of news in our view. SuperGroup shares are currently 32p higher at 637.5p. But online grocer Ocado, where hopes of a bid from Morrisons have faded a little, is heading in the other direction, falling 7.4p to 152p after HSBC analysts moved from neutral to underweight. Meanwhile Marks &amp; Spencer, another company once touted as a possible buyer of Ocado to boost its online presence, has edged up 1.5p to 395p despite a sell note from Espirito Santo. Analyst Caroline Gulliver said: Recent bid speculation and the market rally has pushed M&amp;S's share price to the top of its 360p-400p trading range. We think this is unjustified and weak fourth quarter current trading will lead to a correction. We anticipate that cold weather has led to both declining clothing sales and gross margin investment and thus we have lowered our 2013 pretax profit estimate by 3% to \u00a3640m. Looking ahead to 2014 we forecast only 2.5% profit growth and so trading on 11.9 times our calendarised 2013 earnings per share estimate, we reiterate our sell recommendation.",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets have begun the week, and indeed the quarter, by recording reasonable gains, lifted by hopes of further central bank action after disappointing manufacturing figures from across the globe, flavoured with a touch of takeover speculation. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 78.92 points higher at 6490.66, a 1.23% rise \u2022 Germany's Dax added 1.91% \u2022 France's Cac closed 1.98% higher \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended up 1.4% \u2022 Spain's Ibex added 1.65% \u2022 But Athens was down 1.48% and Cyprus closed 2.48% lower In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 94 points or 0.64% higher while the S&amp;P 500 came to within just three points of its all time intra-day high of 1576. And with that, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow. Laiki bank's 15,000 UK accounts with total balances of \u00a3270m have been transferred to the Bank of Cyprus's UK subsidiary, chancellor George Osborne has confirmed. In a letter to Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of the Treasury select commitee, Osborne said that without a deal Laiki depositors would have been sucked into the restructuring \"and all the uncertainty that would have brought with it\". In his letter, published on the Treasury web site, he wrote: There has been no material recourse to public funds. We have not made a bilateral loan to Cyprus and the UK is not contributing to the financial assistance programme announced by the eurogroup. We support Cypriot efforts to restructure their banking system, as it is in everyone's interests that their financial sector is safe and secure. But I promised a solution that would stop depositors here from being sucked into that restructuring process. We have delivered on that. Over in Greece, our correspondent Helena Smith says prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 coalition government is hopeful it will finalise negotiations when visiting troika officials descend on Athens tomorrow. She writes: Much hangs on the troika\u2019s visit to Greece starting with the debt-stricken country\u2019s next \u20ac2.8bn installment of aid. The tranche has been held up since mission chiefs representing the EU, ECB and IMF cut short their last inspection tour of Greece in March. But emerging from talks with the prime minster, Antonis Samaras, the finance minister Yannis Stournaras said he was confident differences with troika officials would soon be settled. Greek media reports said the governing coalition expected all outstanding differences with foreign lenders to be resolved by the end of the month when Greece hopes to take receipt of a total \u20ac8.8bn (including \u20ac6bn due this month) from creditors. The troika is expected to begin reviewing progress made on budget targets when representatives meet Stournaras on Thursday morning. Greece\u2019s leading daily, Ta Nea, said mission chiefs, including the IMF official Poul Thomsen, expected to be in the country for at least ten days although experience has shown that this could change. Among the thorny issues likely to delay progress are demands that Athens immediately sacks up to 35,000 civil servants from the bloated public sector and continues to apply a highly controversial property tax through electricity bills. ECB board member Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9 has warned of the dangers of currency wars, saying foreign exchange swings caused by misguided policies could become disruptive. This was especially true, he said in a speech for a conference on the subject, since central banks in advanced economies had reached the limits of their ability to manoeuvre. He said: It would be a matter of concern if countries were to directly pursue overt competitive devaluations. The Bank of Japan wants to take aggressive monetary policy measures to hit its inflation target, in terms of the volume and types of assets it purchases. Bank of Cyprus has suspended its operations in Romania for a week, so they can be restructured and sold. Former French budget minister Jerome Cahuzac has admitted he has had a foreign bank account for the last 20 years, containing a reported \u20ac600,000. Cahuzac, in charge of clamping down on tax evasion, resigned last month after allegations that he evaded taxes with a secret Swiss bank account. He had repeatedly denied the accusations, and a legal investigation was opened. Back in Italy, and centre-left leader Pier Luigi Bersani has said the country's problems cannot be solved by new elections, despite its inability to form a government after an inconclusive poll. Bersani repeated he was not willing to form a grand coalition with Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right party. He said a centre-right demand to pick the president of the republic was unacceptable. His task of trying to form a government was over, Bersani said, and a new phase had opened. The president has already appointed 10 wise men to try to find a way out of the deadlock. The International Monetary Fund will close its office in Latvia this summer, after the Baltic state repaid all its outstanding obligations last year following its 2008 bailout. The IMF said: Latvia has regained macroeconomic stability and its economic recovery is now well established, though significant remaining challenges include the ongoing need to address still-high unemployment and to continue microeconomic reforms. The IMF looks forward to continued close cooperation with Latvia, primarily in the context of regular bilateral policy consultations as with other IMF member countries. The country has formally applied to join the euro in 2014. More from Cyprus, with a reported comment from the now ex-finance minister Michael Sarris: And on the reshuffle: And with that I'll hand you over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. A quick look at the markets. In the UK, shares have powered ahead after poor manufacturing data raised hopes the Bank of England may boost its quantitative easing programme earlier than expected. UK FTSE 100: up 1.1%, or 72 points, at 6484 France CAC 40: up 1% Germany DAX: up 1.1% Spain IBEX: up 0.8% Italy FTSE MIB: up 0.7% The Cypriot government has now confirmed that the labour minister, Harris Gerogiades, has been appointed as the new finance minister. A full shakeup of the Cypriot cabinet is expected in the next few hours, ekathimerini reports. It blames the resignation of the Cypriot finance minister on his handling of the crisis since 1 March. From the website \u2026 Cypriot finance minister Michalis Sarris tendered his resignation on Tuesday afternoon, Skai radio reported, following the president's disappointment with his handling of the island's crisis since 1 March. His successor is about to be named, with labour minister Haris Georgiadis being among the favorites. A full shakeup of the Cypriot cabinet is expected in the next few hours, too. Reuters concurs. The Cypriot finance minister, Michael Sarris, has resigned after concluding talks with the island state's international lenders. President Nicos Anastasiades has accepted his resignation. Another headline suggests he has quit because of 'ongoing investigations'. State broadcaster RIK TV says the labour minister, Harris Georgiades, is likely to take his place. Oops. It seems the Cypriot government was premature in its denials over the future of the finance minister, Michael Sarris (see 1.17pm). Bloomberg, for one, is running the headline that Sarris has just resigned. More on that as it comes in \u2026 Further developments in Cyprus, which has concluded talks with its lenders and agreed the final terms of its \u20ac10bn bailout. The government said the island state will get its first slice of aid in May. Here's government spokesman Christos Sylianides: We have concluded on a memorandum. This is a significant development. Under the terms of the deal \u2026 Cyprus has until 2018 to shore up its finances It will pay 2.5% interest on the bailout loans and will start repayment in 10 years' time The finance minister, Michael Sarris, said he hoped to ease capital controls as soon as possible but was unable to say when that might happen. The government earlier had to deny reports that Sarris was going to be replaced. In Italy, 10 wise men appointed by the president are meeting to try to find a way out of the country's political deadlock, following inconclusive elections last month. The ANSA news wire quotes a presidential spokesman saying the meetings are \"absolutely informal, purely reconnaissance, and have obvious time limits\". At 11am local time, a meeting began with the six figures responsible for economic and European issues. At 12, it's the turn of the institutional figures, including the president of the constitutional court and various politicians. The president's office said the meetings are aimed at \u2026 formulating precise policy proposals that can become a target shared by political forces. The meetings have come in for strong criticism from Silvio Berlusconi's party, which described them as a useless waste of time. Over to Slovenia, which many see as the most likely contender for the next international bailout. The head of the central bank, Marko Kranjec, said today he was worried about 2014. He is not the only one. The Slovenian central bank sees GDP contracting by 1.9% this year, but says it will grow by 0.5% in 2014. Kranjec said investors have not been pulling out large amounts of money from Slovenia in the wake of the Cyprus crisis, which saw strict capital controls imposed when the bailout was announced. We are monitoring the [deposit] flows on a daily basis but have not registered significant moves. The way the situation in Cyprus was being solved did not influence the confidence of our depositors. Another gloomy fact of the day. Channel 4's economics editor notes that the rise in eurozone unemployment as a result of the debt crisis will soon beat the rise immediately following the Lehman crash. There's more bad news from Spain, which is set to cut its growth forecasts this week and ask for more time to reduce its budget deficit as the recession cuts deeper than expected, a government source told Reuters. Julien Toyer reports: Spain's gross domestic product (GDP) will be forecast to shrink by 1%, rather than 0.5%, the source said, adding that the government intended to shift emphasis to growth rather than deficit reduction. Spain is negotiating with the European commission for more time to bring its deficit within 3% of GDP, something it is currently expected to do by 2014, the source said. Spain will increase its 2013 deficit target to 6% of GDP, from an existing forecast of 4.5%. The figures on growth and the deficit could still vary by one or two decimal points, depending on the outcome of talks with the commission, the source said. \u2026 If the country is given one extra year, the deficit-cutting path will be 6% of GDP in 2013, 4.5% in 2014 and 3% in 2015, the source said, adding this was the most likely outcome of the negotiations. Back to the eurozone jobless data, where statistics for youth unemployment make particularly grim reading. In Greece, almost 60% of the under 25s are out of work, and in Spain the number continues to rise, hitting 55.7% in February. Only Austria and Germany (not included in the Bloomberg chart below) have rates of under 10%. Here's the EEF, the UK manufacturers' association, on the factory data. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the EEF, said: There\u2019s been very little in any of the survey data over the past couple of months that would indicate that manufacturing has staged a recovery in the first quarter of the year. The continued weakness in the PMI is disappointing overall, but of particular concern is another month of falling export demand. While manufacturers have made some good gains in non-EU markets over the past couple of years, the on-going drag on orders from the eurozone is still significant and likely to impact on prospects over the coming months. Back to the weak UK manufacturing data, which one analyst says comes as no surprise. Christian Schulz of Berenberg Bank writes: The poor performance of manufacturing should come as no surprise. Each of the past three years has seemed to begin with a burst of optimism from the PMIs, followed by a return to reality. This year, the UK's main trading partner remains in recession, and UK domestic demand is being hobbled by the squeeze on household real incomes as inflation runs ahead of wage growth. Sterling's depreciation should help manufacturing later in the year, but March is far too early to see any benefits. He says further stimulus is pretty much inevitable this year. If services PMI data (out on Thursday) is bad, the Bank of England could act as early as this month. But May or August are much more likely months for a move than April. On balance, we stick to our call for Fed-style guidance and more asset purchases to be announced in August, but the risks of an earlier move have risen a touch. Eurozone unemployment data is in, and it makes predictably grim reading. Joblessness in the currency bloc hit an all-time high of 12% in February, compared with an original estimate of 11.9% for January, which has since been revised up to 12%. That is a big jump from this time last year, when the unemployment rate was 10.9%. As usual, there were huge discrepancies between the member states, with the lowest unemployment rates recorded in Austria at 4.8% and Germany at 5.4%. The highest was in Greece, which recorded a rate of 26.4% (although the figures are from December 2012), and Spain, where the rate is 26.3%. Codes as follows... Belgium (BE), Bulgaria (BG), the Czech Republic (CZ), Denmark (DK), Germany (DE), Estonia (EE), Ireland (IE), Greece (EL), Spain (ES), France (FR), Italy (IT), Cyprus (CY), Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Luxembourg (LU), Hungary (HU), Malta (MT), the Netherlands (NL), Austria (AT), Poland (PL), Portugal (PT), Romania (RO), Slovenia (SI), Slovakia (SK), Finland (FI), Sweden (SE) and the United Kingdom (UK). Another attractive chart to display a worrying trend in the eurozone, courtesy of a Norwegian trader. The graph shows the decline of lending in the eurozone, led by Spain (for a larger version, click on the image). Back to Cyprus, where reports suggest the country will ease some of its restrictions designed to stop money flowing out of the country today. Reuters reports: Cyprus is expected to announce a partial relaxation of currency controls on Tuesday, raising the ceiling for financial transactions that do not require central bank approval to \u20ac25,000 from \u20ac5,000, a central bank source said. Cypriot authorities have also decided, in consultation with international lenders, to unblock 10% of a 40% effective freeze on large deposits in Bank of Cyprus under a bail-in arrangement. The country held a Cyprus Aid concert in Nicosia last night, where participants were asked to make a contribution in kind such as food, which will be distributed to individuals, families and other groups in immediate need. Over in the UK, manufacturing missed expectations but is slightly higher than last month. The sector is still in decline, however, with a PMI of 48.3. That's up from February's 47.9, but worse than forecasts of 48.7. Rob Dobson at Markit said the numbers could be enough to push the Bank of England to expand its quantitative easing programme at its meeting next week. He says that first quarter GDP is still on a knife-edge. If the economy contracted again in the first quarter, the UK would slide into its third recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction) in four years. Dobson says: The onus is now on the far larger service sector to prevent the UK from slipping into a triple-dip recession. The ongoing weakness of manufacturing and the hard to estimate impact of bad weather on first quarter growth suggest that this is still touch-and-go and that any expansion will be disappointing nonetheless. Ouch. The Cyprus stock exchange is now down by 2.35%. No great surprise there, but it's not going to do the country any good. With manufacturing in all eurozone member states contracting, analysts say GDP in the currency bloc is likely to have dropped in the first quarter. Here's Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: The deeper contraction in eurozone manufacturing activity in March is both disappointing and worrying. It now looks odds-on that the eurozone suffered further GDP contraction in the first quarter of 2013, likely around 0.3% quarter-on-quarter, while the increased drop in orders and declining backlogs of work does not bode at all well for second quarter prospects. But he does not expect the European Central Bank to rush to cut rates in order to try and drive a recovery. Despite mounting signs that the already weak eurozone economic situation is deteriorating anew and muted inflationary pressures, the ECB still seems likely to hold off from cutting interest rates at its April policy meeting on Thursday. The ECB currently appears reluctant to take interest rates down from 0.75% to 0.50%, partly due to some doubts that such a move would have a beneficial impact given current fragmented conditions in credit markets. And there is a risk that this fragmentation could be magnified by the recent events in Cyprus. However, some governing council members did favour an interest rate cut in March, and we suspect that likely ongoing disappointing eurozone economic news will increasingly prod the ECB towards acting within the next few months. We suspect that the ECB will eventually take interest rates down from 0.75% to 0.50%, very possibly around June. French manufacturing is also predictably bad, with activity down for the 13th month running. The Markit PMI inched up to 44 (from 43.9 in February) but remains significantly below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Jack Kennedy at Markit said: A very slight improvement in the headline PMI figure does little to disguise an ongoing sharp deterioration in French manufacturing sector operating conditions during March. The chart below shows just how badly France has fared compared with the rest of the eurozone. Follow the thin red line. Even German manufacturing is bad, moving back into negative territory after a positive reading in February. The sector \u2013 which represents around a fifth of the German economy \u2013 was hit by a fall in new orders, raising doubts about the strength of the eurozone recovery in the first quarter. Markit's manufacturing PMI for Germany dropped to 49 in March from 50.3. Tim Moore at Markit said: Manufacturers cited heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook especially across export markets within the euro area, as having curtailed client spending. Over to Italy, where manufacturing was even worse than expected, making today a day for negative surprises. The PMI came in at 44.5, substantially below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and missing forecasts of 45.4. It is the 20th straight month in which manufacturing has contracted, with little sign of turning the corner so far. The Cyprus stock exchange is open again after a more than two-week hiatus, and shares are down 0.5%. Trading in the country's two largest lenders, Bank of Cyprus, which will undergo a major restructuring, and Laiki Bank, which will be wound down, has been halted. The stock exchange has been closed since 15 March, when Cyprus announced initial plans for a eurozone bailout (which were subsequently revised). The Cyprus general market index dropped 11% in the first few months of the year, according to Bloomberg. The index has slumped 98% from its peak in October 2007. Over to Switzerland, where the manufacturing sector also unexpectedly moved into negative territory last month. The Swiss PMI dropped to a seasonally adjusted 48.3 in March, from 50.8 in February. That is below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and is a big miss from analyst forecasts of 50.2. Analysts at Credit Suisse and the SVME purchasing managers' association said: The chaos surrounding the bailout package for Cyprus and stalemate in the Italian elections also created uncertainty among Swiss companies. We anticipate that the recent flare-up int eh crisis will last a while yet, but that the medium-term trend toward a recovery in the eurozone is not at risk. Next up Italy, and hopes are not high. Spanish manufacturing fared even worse, with the sector shrinking at its fastest rate since October. The Markit PMI for manufacturing \u2013 which accounts for just over 12% of Spain's economy \u2013 dropped to 44.2 in March from 46.8 in February. There were some signs at the beginning of this year that the long slide in Spanish manufacturing was bottoming out, but this data seems to counter that. Markit economist Andrew Harker said: The data for Spain make grim reading for the manufacturing sector. Moreover, the latest figures have brought an end to the recent period of moderating declines and cast doubt on any hopes of recovery for the rest of the year. Now to today, and the manufacturing data is rolling in from the eurozone. First up, Ireland, which had a shocker in March. Manufacturing in Ireland contracted for the first time in over a year last month, with the shaprest drop in new export orders since the dark days of August 2009. The NCB purchasing managers' index fell to 48.6 in March from 51.5 in February, dropping below the 50 line that separates growth from contraction for the first time since February last year. Cypriot negotiators won concessions from its international lenders over the weekend, on the basis that it is facing a longer and deeper recession than feared. The island state has been granted an extra year to achieve a budget surplus of 4%. The original deal was based on forecasts that the economy would shrink 3.5% this year, but an anonymous government official told the Associated Press that the economy is now projected to contract by about 9%. A government spokesman, Christos Stylianides, said negotiators are now pushing to extend the deadline to 2018 to achieve a better budget surplus. UK customers of Laiki bank will be relieved to hear this morning that they will not lose their savings. My colleague Jill Treanor reports: Some 15,000 account holders at Laiki bank in the UK are to escape any levy imposed on savings by the Cypriot authorities. After a week of negotiations since George Osborne told MPs the government was trying to find ways to stop Laiki being \"sucked\" into the Cyprus bailout, the UK arm of Bank of Cyprus has taken over \u00a3270m of Laiki balances in the UK. As Laiki operates as a \"branch\" in the UK, its depositors were covered by the Cyprus government for the \u20ac100,000 (\u00a385,000) European-wide guarantee in savings but could have been subject to levies above that level. However, as Bank of Cyprus UK Limited is a separately capitalised, UK incorporated bank, it is subject to UK regulation and protected by the financial services compensation scheme which guarantees up to \u00a385,000. Its customers will not be hit by any levy \u2013 possibly 60% on accounts above \u00a385,000 \u2013 or restrictions on limiting withdrawals to \u20ac300 a day. The Cypriot president has now launched an investigation into events leading to the financial crisis. The Wall Street Journal reports: A three-member panel of former top judges tasked with investigating the events leading to the financial crisis has received copies of the lists, Cyprus's top public prosecutor said Monday. On Monday, Mr. Anastasiades said they would leave no stone unturned. \"These three respected judges . . . will be given the mandate to investigate anything that might relate to me, or my relatives by marriage,\" he said. The blame game began in Cyrpus this weekend, with reports emerging that a company with family ties to the president, Nicos Anastasiades, withdrew funds from the island ahead of the bailout. Just to recap, last week Cyprus and the troika of international lenders agreed a \u20ac10bn bailout plan aimed at saving the island from financial meltdown. Under the terms of the deal, depositors holding more than \u20ac100,000 at the Bank of Cyprus will lose 37.5% of their savings in exchange for bank shares. A further 22.5% will be put into a fund that earns no interest and could be confiscated should the bank need further funds. Depositors in Laiki bank with over \u20ac100,000 will face heavy losses. Those with deposits of less than \u20ac100,000 will have their accounts transferred to Bank of Cyprus. The central bank imposed strict capital controls following the announcement of the bailout to stem the flow of funds fleeing the country. It seems, however, that several people had advance warning of the deal and millions of euros leaked out of the island before it was announced. Greek and Cypriot media have published a list of 132 companies and individuals that allegedly pulled money out of Cypriot banks and sent it abroad days before the capital controls came into force. Among them was A Loutsios &amp; Sons Ltd, a company said to be co-owned by the father-in-law of one of Anastasiades's daughters. The list could not be verified, and the company has denied that it moved any cash. The president said the reports were an \"attempt to defame companies or people linked to my family\". A Greek website has published another list, naming six current and former politicians and several others whom it claims benefited from favourable loan restructuring at Laiki Bank. All of those named have denied any wrongdoing. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis and other developments in the global economy. Cyprus continued to dominate the headlines over the weekend, after its controversial bailout that punished savers in Cypriot banks was agreed last week. We'll have all the news from there, the rest of the eurozone and around throughout the day.",

It now looks odds-on that the eurozone suffered further GDP contraction in the first quarter of 2013, likely around 0.3% quarter-on-quarter, while the increased drop in orders and declining backlogs of work does not bode at all well for second quarter prospects.</p> </blockquote> <p>But he does not expect the European Central Bank to rush to cut rates in order to try and drive a recovery.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite mounting signs that the already weak eurozone economic situation is deteriorating anew and muted inflationary pressures, the ECB still seems likely to hold off from cutting interest rates at its April policy meeting on Thursday.<br>&#xa0;<br>The ECB currently appears reluctant to take interest rates down from 0.75% to 0.50%, partly due to some doubts that such a move would have a beneficial impact given current fragmented conditions in credit markets. And there is a risk that this fragmentation could be magnified by the recent events in Cyprus.</p> <p>However, some governing council members did favour an interest rate cut in March, and we suspect that likely ongoing disappointing eurozone economic news will increasingly prod the ECB towards acting within the next few months. We suspect that the ECB will eventually take interest rates down from 0.75% to 0.50%, very possibly around June.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-04-02T13:06:38.984Z\">at 2.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-515a951e95cbd934fc4629ae\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-04-02T08:21:50.509Z\">9.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">French factory slump continues</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>French manufacturing is also predictably bad, with activity down for the 13th month running.</p> <p>The Markit PMI inched up to 44 (from 43.9 in February) but remains significantly below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.&#xa0;</p> <p>Jack Kennedy at Markit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A very slight improvement in the headline PMI figure does little to disguise an ongoing sharp deterioration in French manufacturing sector operating conditions during March.</p> </blockquote> <p>The chart below shows just how badly France has fared compared with the rest of the eurozone.
