      "bodyText": "The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, says politics needs to recognise the insecurities and frustrations of middle-class Australians who are working harder and longer than they did a decade ago, but have less to go around each week. He will also brand recent rhetorical efforts by the prime minister both at the G20 and the East Asia Summit to push back against the rising protectionist forces fracturing the global political consensus about trade liberalisation as \u201carrogant and dangerous\u201d. Shorten will on Thursday attempt to move past the imbroglio that engulfed the New South Wales senator Sam Dastyari with the launch a new report showing middle-class Australians are experiencing a three-year decline in real wages and significant projected declines in their disposable income, yet Australia is continuing to exceed other comparable nations in labour productivity. The new research from the McKell Institute, a progressive thinktank, finds incomes are rising in both the United States and Canada in the years following the global financial crisis, while middle-class incomes in Australia are going backwards. It says the average Australian annual income has declined from US$52,229 per annum to US$51,148 \u2013 which translates to a 2.7% reduction since 2012. Shorten will tell a McKell function in Sydney on Thursday that in an age where there is a growing sense of disempowerment and disillusionment, \u201cwhen, around the world, extremists and demagogues from every point of the political compass are yelling that our system is broken, that democracy has failed, that it\u2019s time to tear it down and start again, it has never been more important to prove to the people who feel forgotten, left out and left behind that they have a stake in society\u201d. The Labor leader says it is important to develop good social policy to ensure investments are made \u201clifting people back into work, in supporting their full participation in our economy and our society\u201d. \u201cWe must begin by recognising existing insecurities and frustrations are not imagined, or insignificant. Millions of Australians are working harder and longer than they did a decade ago \u2013 but have less to go around each week,\u201d he will say. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder there are concerns about flat consumer confidence and falling purchasing power.\u201d The new report contains 26 policy recommendations aimed at bolstering the fortunes of middle-class Australians, including a focus on generating wages growth, ensuring people have sufficient superannuation to support them in retirement, improving education, policies to improve housing affordability, transport and innovation, and reforming the health and tax systems. Many of the recommendations overlap with Labor\u2019s election policies. The report is authored by Richard Holden, professor of economics at the business school at the University of New South Wales, and Edward Cavanough, manager of policy at McKell. The report finds that 2014 was the second continuous year that wages fell in Australia measured in purchasing power parity terms. While conditions had improved in the US and Canada, \u201cthe United Kingdom has continued to suffer a downward average income trajectory since the global financial crisis\u201d. \u201cIn other words, the Australian and British middle classes are finding it harder to make ends meet than they did \u2013 in the UK\u2019s case \u2013 before the global financial crisis, and \u2013 in Australia\u2019s case \u2013 since 2012,\u201d the report says. The report concludes wages growth in Australia is slowing, and will stall in the coming years. \u201cCurrently, the average weekly wage for an Australian is $1,145.70. However, this is expected to only grow in real terms to $1,243 per week by 2020. This growth is incredibly slow by Australian and international standards alike, and highlights the threat to the continuation of Australia\u2019s middle-class standard of living.\u201d But the report points out while wages growth is stagnating, Australia\u2019s labour productivity performance is continuing to eclipse the performance of other comparable nations. \u201cWhile the Australian middle class is experiencing a three-year decline in real wages and significant projected declines in disposable incomes, it is continuing to exceed other comparable nations in labour productivity,\u201d the report says. \u201cWhat the data demonstrates is that while Australia\u2019s middle and working class is feeling the effects of slower wage growth and higher costs of living, the Australian economy is still becoming more productive, particularly when compared to the productivity growth (or reduction) seen in other comparable developed countries. \u201cThe situation understandably leaves many Australians in the middle and working class feeling less content in their daily life, having often worked harder, longer and more productive, but are still struggling to make ends meet in an increasingly challenging economic climate. \u201cWhile Australians have a strong minimum wage and safety net, it is vital that Australians are able to enter the middle class and stay there, not rely on falling back into minimum wage territory.\u201d Shorten \u2013 who has faced disruption over the course of the past week courtesy of the controversy relating to Sam Dastyari\u2019s decision to accept a donation from a wealthy Chinese businessman \u2013 will have a dig at the recent efforts by the prime minister to reframe the policy debate around trade liberalisation and the new economy. \u201cTelling people locked out of the housing market to \u2018get rich parents\u2019, or dismissing legitimate frustrations with the uneven opportunities of the \u2018new economy\u2019 as \u2018hiding under the doona\u2019 is arrogant and dangerous,\u201d Shorten will say. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to wax lyrical about free trade and pour scorn on the evils of protectionism from a position of financial security. But nothing undermines faith in free trade faster than a flawed agreement that costs local jobs, or puts them in jeopardy. \u201cNothing is more harmful to the argument for an international labour market than a visa system where imported workers are exploited \u2013 and Australians miss out.\u201d In a recent interview with Guardian Australia, former Liberal prime minister John Howard stressed the importance of bolstering the position of the Australian middle class, arguing the decline of middle class fortunes in the US during the global financial crisis was one of the factors fuelling the rise of Donald Trump. Howard reasoned a stable middle class with rising prosperity was like \u201ccement\u201d holding a society together. \u201cThat\u2019s the greatest strength that Australia has \u2013 we have more, proportionately, in the middle,\u201d Howard said. \u201cThis is one of America\u2019s problems and one of the explanations of the Trump phenomenon.\u201d \u201cI think there is truth in the argument that [Trump] is appealing to people who have suffered,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir incomes have fallen, many of them have lost their jobs, the statistics tell a vivid story \u2013 people are just worse off now, in the middle.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Got a spare 50 quid, Mike Ashley? Do you fancy a bet on your prediction that Keith Hellawell will defy the doubters and regain the support of Sports Direct\u2019s outside shareholders at next year\u2019s annual meeting? This column says it won\u2019t happen. Fund managers are timid creatures by nature but, once roused, tend not to back down. Legal &amp; General\u2019s Sacha Sadan, speaking after outsiders\u2019 53% vote against Hellawell, said the chairman should go immediately \u201cat absolute minimum\u201d. L&amp;G is unlikely to be swayed by the plea that the chairman should be judged with fresh eyes in 12 months\u2019 time. Nobody would pretend it is easy to stand up to a forceful character like Ashley, but Hellawell has been chairman since 2009 and has never demonstrated he is even remotely up to the task. The scandal over working conditions had bubbled away for years, ignored or disregarded by the board. An effective chairman would have seen that Ashley\u2019s siege mentality (bizarrely, he was still trying to blame the Unite union for the warehouse scandal on Wednesday) was leading to crisis and would have ensured caution. Instead, Hellawell chose to go to war with outside shareholders over the board\u2019s right to give the billionaire boss a \u00a370m bonus scheme. Similarly, Standard Life probably was not impressed by Hellawell\u2019s claim to have engaged regularly with shareholders. Its representative, Euan Stirling, had just told the annual meeting that Standard Life voted its 5.8% stake against the re-election of all the non-executive directors. One reason was the \u201cunconvincing or non-existent\u201d replies by the board to its inquiries over many years. Standard Life does not sound like a floating voter. Even now, at the moment of supposed reform, Hellawell stood squarely behind the arrangement whereby Ashley\u2019s daughter\u2019s 26-year-old boyfriend, Mike Murray, runs the property team on a contract that could be worth millions and where remuneration for overseeing a \u00a3300m budget is \u201cat the board\u2019s discretion\u201d. Hellawell conceded that \u201cwith the benefit of hindsight\u201d a distribution deal involving Ashley\u2019s brother\u2019s company could have been disclosed in financial reports, but that hardly amounts to an apology, let alone an explanation. Hellawell now cuts a feeble figure. He offered to resign at the weekend, but Ashley would not let him. On Wednesday a majority of outside shareholders said they want him out, but again Ashley blocked the exit. Hellawell can limp on for a year with the founder\u2019s backing, but the reinvention of Sports Direct will be unbelievable until a capable and independent chairman is in place. The Bank can do no more Mark Carney is feeling comfortable and serene. Judgments made by the Bank of England before the referendum were accurate, says the governor; and the Bank\u2019s actions after the vote for Brexit, including the cut in interest rates last month, have helped the economy to adjust. Fair comment? Broadly, yes. Carney\u2019s critics were wrong to accuse him of participating in Project Fear. The Bank is charged with policing financial stability and thus was obliged to make a few judgments about what might happen if the leave campaign won. In another age, silence from Threadneedle Street might have been an option, but not in an era of transparency and scrutiny by the Treasury select committee. Carney was careful to stay neutral in the debate. The contentious remarks were the ones about Brexit being the biggest domestic risk to financial stability, bringing the danger of a \u201cmaterial slowdown in growth\u201d.

On a two-year view, which tends to be the Bank\u2019s horizon, the fallout from Brexit remains almost impossible to assess meaningfully.

The current ray of economic sunshine has brought the charge that the Bank was too hasty in cutting rates. On that score, Carney probably overstated matters in taking credit for stabilising markets. A quarter-point cut in rates is a tweak, after all. But a cut was still the right thing to do. It signalled to investors, businesses and consumers that the UK is not powerless in the face of change. That message will be only be useful, however, if it is also heard by politicians. With interest rates at 0.25%, the Bank has almost exhausted its tool kit.

Do you fancy a bet on your prediction that Keith Hellawell will defy the doubters and regain the support of Sports Direct\u2019s outside shareholders at next year\u2019s annual meeting? This column says it won\u2019t happen.</p> <p>Fund managers are timid creatures by nature but, once roused, tend not to back down. Legal &amp; General\u2019s Sacha Sadan, speaking after outsiders\u2019 53% vote against Hellawell, said the chairman should go immediately \u201cat absolute minimum\u201d. L&amp;G is unlikely to be swayed by the plea that the chairman should be judged with fresh eyes in 12 months\u2019 time.</p> <p>Nobody would pretend it is easy to stand up to a forceful character like Ashley, but Hellawell has been chairman since 2009 and has never demonstrated he is even remotely up to the task. The scandal over working conditions had bubbled away for years, ignored or disregarded by the board. An effective chairman would have seen that Ashley\u2019s siege mentality (bizarrely, he was still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/sports-direct-board-turned-down-chairman-keith-hellawell-resignation\">trying to blame the Unite union</a> for the warehouse scandal on Wednesday) was leading to crisis and would have ensured caution. Instead, Hellawell chose to go to war with outside shareholders over the board\u2019s right to give the billionaire boss a \u00a370m bonus scheme.</p> <p>Similarly, Standard Life probably was not impressed by Hellawell\u2019s claim to have engaged regularly with shareholders. Its representative, Euan Stirling, had just told the annual meeting that Standard Life voted its 5.8% stake against the re-election of all the non-executive directors. One reason was the \u201cunconvincing or non-existent\u201d replies by the board to its inquiries over many years. Standard Life does not sound like a floating voter.</p> <p>Even now, at the moment of supposed reform, Hellawell stood squarely behind the arrangement whereby Ashley\u2019s daughter\u2019s 26-year-old boyfriend, Mike Murray, runs the property team on a contract that could be worth millions and where remuneration for overseeing a \u00a3300m budget is \u201cat the board\u2019s discretion\u201d. Hellawell conceded that \u201cwith the benefit of hindsight\u201d a distribution deal involving Ashley\u2019s brother\u2019s company could have been disclosed in financial reports, but that hardly amounts to an apology, let alone an explanation.</p> <p>Hellawell now cuts a feeble figure. He offered to resign at the weekend, but Ashley would not let him. On Wednesday a majority of outside shareholders said they want him out, but again Ashley blocked the exit. Hellawell can limp on for a year with the founder\u2019s backing, but the reinvention of Sports Direct will be unbelievable until a capable and independent chairman is in place.</p> <h2>The Bank can do no more</h2> <p>Mark Carney is feeling comfortable and serene. Judgments made by the Bank of England before the referendum were accurate, says the governor; and the Bank\u2019s actions after the vote for Brexit, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">cut in interest rates last month</a>, have helped the economy to adjust. Fair comment?</p> <p>Broadly, yes. Carney\u2019s critics were wrong to accuse him of participating in Project Fear. The Bank is charged with policing financial stability and thus was obliged to make a few judgments about what might happen if the leave campaign won. In another age, silence from Threadneedle Street might have been an option, but not in an era of transparency and scrutiny by the Treasury select committee.</p> <p>Carney was careful to stay neutral in the debate. The contentious remarks were the ones about Brexit being the biggest domestic risk to financial stability, bringing the danger of a \u201cmaterial slowdown in growth\u201d.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct\u2019s billionaire founder, Mike Ashley, is standing by his under-fire chairman, Keith Hellawell, despite independent shareholders in the sports retailer voting to oust the former police chief. . An unprecedented 57% of independent shareholders failed to support Hellawell at the annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, but Ashley insisted his chairman was staying put, for at least another year, and they would work together to improve the way the sports chain is managed. . At the sometimes bad-tempered meeting, Ashley at one point said the retailer\u2019s problems had been caused by the Unite union and hinted that he might himself walk away from the company he founded in 1982 if he was unable to improve the way the firm is run. There was also a major protest vote against Sports Direct\u2019s three other non-executive directors. More than 30% of independent shareholders failed to back their reappointment amid widespread concern that they had failed to hold Ashley to account. At the packed meeting of more than 120 people at Sports Direct\u2019s head office, alongside its controversial warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, Ashley was challenged by investors and unions over the treatment of workers. The company has been under intense scrutiny since a Guardian investigation last year, which revealed that Sports Direct was failing to pay the national minimum wage to warehouse workers. Under new financial regulatory rules, the company will have to hold a second vote in 90 to 120 days\u2019 time at which Hellawell\u2019s reappointment can be pushed through with the backing of Ashley\u2019s 55% majority stake. Hellawell insisted he was justified in carrying on in the \u00a3155,000-a-year role. \u201cInvestors recognise my integrity,\u201d he said. \u201cMy position is not untenable. The majority of shareholders in this company support me\u201d. However, he said he would step down next year if independent investors still wanted him to go. \u201cI am here to prove to the majority of independent shareholders who don\u2019t support me that I am making a valuable contribution to this company and over the next 12 months I\u2019ll be judged on that contribution,\u201d he said. Ashley said Hellawell\u2019s years of experience in working with him would help implement a turnaround plan announced earlier this week after months of pressure from shareholders, unions and the media. \u201cKeith knows my strengths, and my weaknesses, and we\u2019re beginning to learn some of the company\u2019s weaknesses, together,\u201d he said. With his voice almost breaking, he pleaded with shareholders to give him more time: \u201cSo, we\u2019re going to fix it. Please give us 12 months to fix it. What difference is 12 months?\u201d Ashley admitted that he had made \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d mistakes in the running of the warehouse and admitted he might quit the business himself if he could not deliver improvements: \u201cIn the end, if I keep failing and keep failing and keep failing, it\u2019ll be best for everybody if I go. But give me some time to see if I can fix the problems first, please.\u201d. Shares in Sports Direct fell more than 10% to 314.4p on Wednesday as investors expressed disbelief that the company was resisting change at the top despite promises to listen to shareholders. The company warned that profits would be just \u00a3300m, 21% lower than expected this year, as costs rise and it spends more on buying property. Sacha Sadan, the director of corporate governance at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, called on Hellawell to step down immediately to be replaced by an external independent chair. \u201cFollowing Sports Direct\u2019s recent report on its own shortcomings, as well as the large independent shareholder vote against the chairman\u2019s re-election, it is clear the board needs to enact significant change in order to earn back shareholder trust,\u201d Sadan said. On Tuesday, Sports Direct tried to respond to criticisms by revealing plans to offer shop workers the option of guaranteed hours contracts instead of zero hours. It said it would suspend the notorious \u201csix strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d policy in its warehouse which meant workers could lose their jobs for relatively minor infringements. At the meeting in Shirebrook, Steve Turner, the assistant general secretary of Unite, said he would not be surprised if only a few workers took up the offer of 12 guaranteed hours a week as most were working much longer shifts. His criticism prompted an angry outburst from Ashley, who blamed the Unite union for the company\u2019s problems. Ashley said: \u201cThis is probably your fault we are in this situation because we can\u2019t talk to you in an open manner. \u201cI\u2019ve made a commitment to make a difference and I\u2019m trying so don\u2019t pull me down. Don\u2019t do the whole showboating thing. It will make me turn away and the only people who suffer are people that work at Sports Direct.\u201d Nearly 21% of all shareholders voted to support a union-backed resolution calling for an independent review of working practices at Sports Direct \u2013 a highly unusual level of support for shareholder resolution. The report published earlier this week was compiled by Ashley\u2019s lawyers. Janet Williamson, the chair of the Trade Union Shareowners group said: \u201cToday\u2019s shareholder uprising should act as a cautionary tale to other employers. Sports Direct\u2019s reputation has been dragged through the mud and its share price has taken a hammering. \u201cThe company must now commit to holding a genuinely independent investigation into how the company treats its workers. Without wholesale changes to working conditions, Sports Direct risks finding itself back in the dock.\u201d Speaking after the meeting, Hellawell told the Guardian that Sports Direct\u2019s board had not moved to make changes before the Guardian investigation, despite years of criticisms, because they had not been given correct information about working conditions. \u201cWe were acting on the information we had,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "South African retail group Steinhoff is to buy Poundland for more than \u00a3610m after shareholders in the discount retailer approved the deal, despite an intervention by hedge fund Elliott Advisors. Almost 98% of votes were cast in favour of the deal at a meeting of Poundland shareholders, with 79% of shareholders voting. The vote means Steinhoff is poised to finally complete a takeover of a British-listed retailer, after its attempts to buy Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos, and Darty, the French electrical retailer, were rebuffed. Steinhoff is backed by Christo Wiese, the South African retail billionaire, who has publicly stated his ambition to expand his interests in Britain. Steinhoff already owns furniture chains Harveys and Bensons for Beds in the UK. Steinhoff\u2019s takeover of Poundland was thrown into doubt when aggressive US hedge fund Elliott, which was an investor in electrical retailer Comet before it collapsed, built up a stake of almost 25% in the discount chain. This led to Steinhoff increasing its offer from 222p per share to 227p per share, including a dividend. It is understood that Elliott voted in favour of the deal. The hedge fund is estimated to have made a profit of at least \u00a33m. The offer price represents a premium of 43% to the Poundland share price before news of Steinhoff\u2019s interest emerged. However, it is well below the 300p per share that Poundland floated at two years ago. The company has struggled since buying rival chain 99p Stores and finding it in a worse state than expected. It is also under growing pressure from other discount retailers such as B&amp;M, and from a price war among the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarket chains, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons. Steinhoff\u2019s takeover of Poundland is now scheduled to be legally completed on 16 September. It has already been approved by the European commission.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England governor has rejected criticism that the central bank overcooked warnings of a hit to the economy after a vote to leave the EU despite signs that the downturn will be shallow. Under fire from Brexit campaigners, Mark Carney said he was \u201cabsolutely serene\u201d about the Bank\u2019s warning of a possible downturn in economic growth and its preparations for the impact from the Brexit vote. He said Threadneedle Street reacted properly to weak economic data after the referendum on 23 June, with a cut in interest rates and extra monetary stimulus. \u201cI am absolutely serene about the \u2026 judgments made both by the MPC and the FPC,\u201d Carney told an influential committee of MPs, referring to the Bank\u2019s monetary and financial policy committees. The Bank governor suffered a volley of criticism from supporters of Brexit in the run-up to the referendum and in the immediate aftermath for saying the economy would face a material slowdown, and possibly a recession, in the event of a vote to leave. Business and consumer surveys have suggested that much of Britain\u2019s economy avoided the devastating hit from a Brexit vote forecast by some supporters of the remain campaign, though economists say the UK is heading for a slowdown. Carney welcomed the improvements in business sentiment and output in August after a slump in July, claiming it was partly a result of the Bank\u2019s actions. The Bank of England cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25% from 0.5% and said it would pump an additional \u00a360bn in electronic cash into the economy to buy government bonds, extending the existing quantitative easing programme to \u00a3435bn in total. The package of measures also included up to \u00a3100bn of new funding to banks to help them pass on the base rate cut. In a controversial move that sparked fierce criticism, the Bank predicted growth would come to a near-standstill over the coming months and be much weaker in 2017 and 2018 than predicted before the Brexit vote. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg accused the governor and its rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) of going too far in its warnings, which were shown to be flawed by data that showed much of the economy had recovered or at least stabilised since the vote. Steve Baker, Tory MP for Wycombe, said he welcomed the Bank\u2019s intervention after the vote but said he sympathised with critics who said it risked bolstering the money supply and adding to inflationary pressures. They were joined by Labour MP John Mann, a high-profile Brexit campaigner, who told Carney the MPC was in danger of using up its ammunition when further shocks were possible, including instability in the eurozone. Carney said: \u201cI absolutely feel comfortable with the decision I supported and the committee took in August to supply monetary policy stimulus.\u201d He said the Bank had expected the main sectors of Britain\u2019s economy to bounce back after the initial impact of the referendum in July, as shown in a series of purchasing managers\u2019 indexes published in recent days. The Bank said in August that most of its policymakers expected to cut interest rates further below their record low later this year, if the economy slowed as expected. Carney was a witness at the Treasury select committee with Sir Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor for financial stability, and MPC members Kristin Forbes and Gertjan Vlieghe. Forbes said she voted for the rate cut but was wary of overreacting to one month\u2019s data with a bigger stimulus package that might be needed if there were further negative shocks, especially from abroad. \u201cI\u2019m a believer in saving tools and not using them, unless the benefits outweigh the costs,\u201d she said. Cunliffe said he expected to vote for another rate cut this year if the economy evolved as the Bank forecast last month.",

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct faces critics at AGM showdown \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A late PS: Mike Ashley and his big bundle of notes make the front page of several papers tomorrow: It\u2019s been a day of contrition, confrontation and humiliation for Sports Direct; and the company faces more rough times unless it actually delivers the better working practices it has promised. Here are the key points. 1) Mike Ashley, Sports Direct\u2019s founder, has pleaded for time to turn his company around. Speaking after a stormy AGM, Ashley told reporters that: We\u2019re going to fix it. Please give us 12 months to fix it. What difference is 12 months? We\u2019ve done some good work in 90 days - lets do some fantastic work in 12 months. 2) Ashley also hinted that his own future is now on the line: In the end, if I keep failing and keep failing and keep failing, it\u2019ll be best for everybody if I go. But give me some time to see if I can fix the problems first, please. 3) But City shareholders have lost patience with his boardroom sidekick, chairman Keith Hellawell. A stunning 53% of independent investors voted against Hellawell\u2019s re-election, pushing for change at the top of the company. Hellawell claims he can regain their trust over the next 12 months, but will resign if he fails. Investors aren\u2019t impressed, though; Legal &amp; General have demanded a new chairman right away: \u201cAt absolute minimum, we believe the current chairman should step down immediately and an external, independent appointment made to oversee management and protect the interests of all stakeholders \u2013 including employees, suppliers, and shareholders.\u201d 4) Sports Direct tried to win some support from the media, and investors, by allowing them to tour part of the Shirebrook site. But the takeaway moment from the trip was the pile of cash which emerged from Ashley\u2019s pocket. I\u201dm starting to suspect it may be a cunning ploy to distract us.... 5) Earlier in the day, Ashley didn\u2019t do a brilliant job of keeping his cool during the company\u2019s annual general meeting. The lowest point was when he blamed the Unite union for causing the problems at Shirebrook, and for \u2018showboating\u2019 by criticising his offer of permanent contracts for casual detail staff. He declared: This is probably your fault we are in this mess because we can\u2019t talk to you. I made a commitment to make a difference, I am trying, don\u2019t pull me down. I accept I have made some errors and I accept I can learn something. Please don\u2019t do the whole showboating thing, it will make me turn away and it\u2019s the people who work in Sports Direct who suffer.\u201d That outburst suggests that the pressure and criticism may be getting to Ashley. Perhaps he also hoped for more praise for his turnaround plan, which aims to emulate glossier retailers like Selfridge\u2019s. If so, he\u2019ll need to work minor miracles over the next 12 months to win bouquets from today\u2019s critics. It\u2019s not impossible - but with profits falling, Ashley will need all his retail skills to pull it off. That\u2019s all from me tonight (although I may pop back later to add any new developments). Thanks for reading and commenting. GW. My colleague Simon Goodley paid a return visit to Sports Direct today, nearly a year after going undercover at the Shirebrook site to expose its failings. And he\u2019s none too impressed with the company\u2019s attempt to charm journalists and investors today by showing them a shiny new operation. Simon explains: The show...was a disappointment. This was not a tour of the huge, bustling, Shirebrook warehouse where Guardian undercover reporters revealed last year how the company had broken the law by paying its workers less than the national minimum wage. Instead, the crowd of around 200 observers, all dressed in bright yellow hi-vis jackets, were shown around Sports Direct\u2019s spacious, brand new, facility, gleaming white walls and all. It even smelt new and freshly painted - meaning it was tempting to conclude that shareholders were actually witnessing a whitewash at the workhouse. Despite the pledges of a new transparency, the spectators barely saw any of Sports Direct\u2019s 4,000 warehouse workers (had they been abolished along with the six strikes and you\u2019re out policy?). And when workers were spotted, the visitors were separated from them by a line of large Sports Direct security staff. Not that that mattered. Those who broke through reported that the workers were unanimous: Shirebrook was actually a splendid place to work. If that felt strange, there were other peculiar differences too. The tannoy - which when the Guardian and Channel 4 had visited last year occasionally harangued staff - never barked any orders at all, either in English or Polish. And the only person to be searched was Mike Ashley himself.... Here\u2019s a video clip of Mike Ashley\u2019s search today -- for anyone who missed the fun and games earlier: The Press Association have a good take on the Sports Direct tour - and the moment Mike Ashley stunned reporters (and perhaps staff too) by pulling out that wad of \u00a350s: Mike Ashley was sorry - this he wanted to make clear. As he conducted a tour of his Sports Direct empire, he drove home the message that he was not ducking any responsibility when it came to the retailer\u2019s problems. Sports Direct had grown too big too quickly and its Shirebrook warehouse was not built for the age of internet shopping, he said. It was a point he made repeatedly. He was happy to see headlines saying he was apologetic about the retailer\u2019s problems, but not that he was making excuses, he added. But his sense of regret at the controversies swirling around Sports Direct did not dull his sense of mischief. As he weaved his way through the cavernous halls, he said: \u201cI know size is no excuse and that is not a joke so please don\u2019t any of the reporters say I am referring to anything else because I am not.\u201d Despite journalists and angry investors having been a thorn in his side over recent months, he appeared to enjoy showing them the site where working practices have generated so much controversy. A swarm of investors and journalists dressed in high-visibility jackets were shown the canteen, the vast areas for picking stock and the security checkpoint. The retail tycoon also took it upon himself to demonstrate a Sports Direct security check - a previous source of complaints by some staff. Pulling off his jacket, he then emptied his pockets, pulling out a wad of fifty pound notes and tossing them into a security tray. When someone pointed out it was a \u201clot of cash\u201d, he replied: \u201cYes I\u2019ve been to the casino,\u201d before adding: \u201cNow don\u2019t please write that.\u201d Commentators have been arguing for years that British business should learn from their German rivals, and put workers in the boardroom. Prime minister Theresa May even expressed support for the idea, putting it higher on the political agenda. So Sports Direct could be ahead of a trend. But Roger Bull, head of the Employment Law team at independent UK law firm, Burges Salmon LLP, suggests getting the idea into law will be hard: The appointment by Sports Direct of an employee to the Board is an astute move, no doubt intended to demonstrate that company\u2019s willingness to embrace change and encourage employee participation. \u201cHowever, the Government has a far tougher task if it wants to legislate on employee Board appointments given the many questions that would need addressing, including the size of the company to whom such rules would apply, the number of employee directors, the nature and status of the role of employee director, the nature of the Board on which they would sit, the selection/election process, confidentiality, trade union involvement and pay etc.\u201d Sports Direct\u2019s shares have endured a bad day, closing down almost 9%. That\u2019s primarily due to this morning\u2019s admission that profits will probably fall 20% this year, from \u00a3380m to \u00a3300m. But investors are also unimpressed that Keith Hellawell is sticking around as chairman, despite today\u2019s historic revolt from the City. Sky News\u2019s Charlotte Lomas has spotted a fresh innovation at Sports Direct -- a list of its best stock pickers. The top worker stands to win a \u00a325 voucher -- all part of the new regime more carrot, less stick. Earlier, my colleague Sarah Butler tweeted more interesting comments from Ashley from the warehouse tour: Here\u2019s the full quote from Sacha Sadan, Director of Corporate Governance at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, calling for Hellawell to quit Sports Direct. \u201cFollowing Sports Direct\u2019s recent report on its own shortcomings, as well as the large independent shareholder vote against the chairman\u2019s re-election, it is clear the Board needs to enact significant change in order to earn back shareholder trust. \u201cAt absolute minimum, we believe the current chairman should step down immediately and an external, independent appointment made to oversee management and protect the interests of all stakeholders \u2013 including employees, suppliers, and shareholders.\u201d The Trade Union Share Owners group has hailed the rebellion against Keith Hellawell today. It believes the revolt by independent investors is a record - and one which other firms should learn from. TUSO Chair Janet Williamson says: \u201cToday\u2019s shareholder uprising should act as a cautionary tale to other employers. Sports Direct\u2019s reputation has been dragged through the mud and its share price has taken a hammering. \u201cThe company must now commit to holding a genuinely independent investigation into how the company treats its workers. Without wholesale changes to working conditions, Sports Direct risks finding itself back in the dock. \u201cHopefully this vote will usher in a new era of investors working with unions to challenge bad employment practices.\u201d Steve Turner, Unite general secretary, has responded to the shareholder revolt against Keith Hellawell today: \u201cInvestors have sent a robust message to the Sports Direct board that it has much more to do to reform and regain confidence. As well as corporate governance Sports Direct must urgently work with Unite to put in place a framework which moves the thousands of temporary agency workers at Shirebrook on to secure, permanent direct contracts. We remain committed to work constructively with Sports Direct to help restore dignity and respect to the work place.\u201d City firm Legal &amp; General aren\u2019t convinced by Ashley and Hellawell\u2019s arguments. They want the chairman to quit now, having lost the support of independent investors today. Q: Final question, how do you feel about Iain Wright MP claiming that you and Sir Philip Green are \u2018two peas in a pod\u2019? No, I\u2019m far better looking than him, Ashley shoots back, before heading back into the HQ. Back to Mike Ashley.... Q: Why are you so determined to keep Keith Hellawell as chairman when the majority of independent shareholders want him to leave? Ashley says Keith has experience of working with him, which will help with the turnaround plan at Sports Direct. Keith knows my strengths, and my weaknesses, and we\u2019re beginning to learn some of the company\u2019s weaknesses, together. Ashley\u2019s voice almost breaks at this point: So, we\u2019re going to fix it. Please give us 12 months to fix it. What difference is 12 months? We\u2019ve done some good work in 90 days - lets do some fantastic work in 12 months. If we fail, Ashley concludes, I\u2019ll be stood here in a year\u2019s time, saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I got it wrong again. When is this ever going to end?\u201d City investors do recognise my integrity and my experience, Hellawell insists. But if they don\u2019t have a change of heart over the next 12 months, I will leave. Q: But surely your position is untenable, after today\u2019s protest vote. Hellawell denies it: My position is not untenable - the majority of shareholders in this company support me. I am here to prove to the majority of independent shareholders who don\u2019t support me that I making a valuable contribution to this company, and over the next 12 months I\u2019ll be judged on that contribution. Chairman Keith Hellawell is taking questions now. Q: Were you surprised by the scale of the rebellion against you today? Hellawell says it\u2019s disappointing - he needs to prove that changes have been made in a year\u2019s time. Q: Why didn\u2019t you realise there were problems at Sports Direct two years ago when a women gave birth in the toilets? Hellawell claims this incident has been misreported. It\u2019s an \u201cextreme example\u201d and doesn\u2019t represent Sports Direct as a company. Q: Your shareholders want you to go - why won\u2019t you? That\u2019s not true, Hellawell replies - the majority shareholder (Ashley) still backs me. Q: But your shareholders don\u2019t believe you are competent. Hellawell says he will prove his competence over the next 12 months. He also claims that it\u2019s \u201cnot true\u201d that there have been problems for years and years and years Q: They\u2019ve been widely reported on the BBC, on ITV, SKy News, on the Guardian - if you\u2019d read a newspaper or listened to a broadcast, you\u2019d have been aware of them. We are aware of the issues,and we are tackling them, Hellawell says. Mike Ashley then tells reporters that he should step down from Sports Direct if he can\u2019t turn the company around. Q: Have you been hurt by the personal criticisms from City institutions, Mr Ashley, saying you aren\u2019t the right man to lead the company? Ashley says he understand the frustrations, but they do hurt him personally. But he still has to believe he\u2019s the right man to lead Sports Direct forwards. I\u2019m a man who gets some things very right, and other things very wrong. I got the staff bonus very right for a few years. Hundreds of millions [of pounds]. Fantastic. I seem to have got the warehouse completely wrong. Totally unacceptable. We\u2019ve got to keep the positives and focus on the negatives. In the end, if I keep failing and keep failing and keep failing, it\u2019ll be best for everybody if I go. But give me some time to see if I can fix the problems first, please. Mike Ashley and Keith Hellawell are facing the media now, after 53% of shareholders (excluding Ashley) dramatically voted against Hellawell\u2019s re-election as chairman today. Ashley says he welcomes Hellawell\u2019s support and knowledge to \u201cmake a difference\u201d Q: But if you were serious about change, Mr Ashley, you\u2019d accept your chairman\u2019s resignation (tendered last week). I am serious about change, Ashley insists. Together, Keith and I will make some huge changes. Q: How can you have a chairman who doesn\u2019t have the confidence of your independent investors? Ashley says he believes Hellawell will regain the confidence of shareholders over the next 12 months. We should be given time to work on the businesses\u2019 shortcomings. Q: Aren\u2019t you just sticking two fingers up to the City, politicians and the union? That would make no sense, Ashley says. We want to make a genuine difference. BREAKING: A majority of Sports Direct\u2019s independent shareholders have voted against Keith Hellawell\u2019s reappointment as chairman today. Figures just released show that 53% of shares cast by investors, excluding Mike Ashley, opposed Hellawell\u2019s re-election. Including abstentions, and a whopping 57% of shareholders refused to back him! That\u2019s a massive slapdown from the City. There was also significant protests against other non-executives, as this table shows: However, Ashley cast his shares (55% of the company) in favour of Hellawell. That means the chairman will survive, and a new vote will be called in 90 days (where Ashley\u2019s stake will again be decisive). The company says that it is \u201cdisappointed to note that the resolution to re-elect the Chairman was not approved by a majority of the Company\u2019s independent shareholders\u201d. Keith Hellawell has repeated that he will resign in a year\u2019s time, if shareholders oppose him again. \u201cI take this clear message from our independent shareholders seriously, and I will do my best to address their concerns and earn their confidence over the next year. I have confirmed today that should I not receive the support of a majority of our independent shareholders at next year\u2019s AGM, I will step down at that time with immediate effect.\u201d Here\u2019s a taste of our latest news story about Ashley\u2019s clash with Unite: Mike Ashley, Sports Direct\u2019s founder and majority shareholder, has blamed the Unite union for the company\u2019s problems in an angry outburst at the retailer\u2019s annual shareholder meeting. In a packed meeting of more than 120 people at the head office in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, Ashley was challenged by the union\u2019s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, over a pledge to offer shop-floor staff 12-hour contracts instead of zero hours. Turner said he would not be surprised if few workers took up the offer as most were working much longer hours every week. Ashley told Turner that the 12-hour promise did not mean Sports Direct would reduce hours for those who worked longer. He said: \u201cThis is probably your fault we are in this situation because we can\u2019t talk to you in an open manner. \u201cI\u2019ve made a commitment to make a difference and I\u2019m trying so don\u2019t pull me down. Don\u2019t do the whole showboating thing. It will make me turn away and the only people who suffer are people that work at Sports Direct. More here: Here\u2019s a better photo of the protests outside Sports Direct\u2019s HQ: Mike Ashley appears to have regained his good spirits: Maybe he enjoyed showing his warehouse off to the journalists today. The Unite union are holding a demonstration at Shirebrook today. They\u2019re urging Ashley to offer permanent contracts to the thousands of agency workers who keep his warehouse running. You can see them in the background, here: Unite have played a major role in exposing the problems at Sports Direct. Back in June, its officials told MPs about the poor conditions at Shirebrook, such as 110 ambulance callouts to the warehouse - including five for birth and miscarriage-related reasons. If you can\u2019t get the video of Mike Ashley producing his wad of \u00a350 notes to play, try clicking here. Mike Ashley says that every Sports Direct worker will get a vote on the new \u2018employee representative\u2019 who will join the board. That\u2019s from my colleague Sarah Butler, who is touring the site now: For most journalists, this is their first taste of life inside the Shirebrook warehouse. Mike Ashley has admitted that mistakes were made - but he\u2019s also hoping to prove the difficulty in controlling such a huge site. The BBC\u2019s Joe Miller explains: And The Times\u2019s Deirdre Hipwell has captured one of the many lines of products, waiting to be collected by the army of workers. Mike Ashley has stuffed his \u00a350 notes away, and started discussing the issue of how staff were paid below the minimum wage. He says he only discovered the problems with searches last December, after the Guardian exposed them. Ashley hasn\u2019t forgotten that report, saying: \u201cHe\u2019s not my favourite person, the Guardian man. Where is he?\u201d Still here. For now..... Oh dear lord, Mike Ashley has just been searched by Sports Direct\u2019s security staff - and produced a chunky wad of \u00a350 notes from his pockets. When asked if he really just placed \u201ca lot of cash\u201d in the security tray, Ashley grinned: Yes, I\u2019ve just been to the casino.....No, don\u2019t please write that. Buzzfeed\u2019s Simon Neville helpfully captured it on video: My colleague Simon Goodley has managed to send a photo from the scrum around Mike Ashley: Ashley seems to have cheered up a bit, following his attack at Unite during the AGM. But will it last?.... Mike Ashley is posing for photos and chatting to journalists as the tour gets underway. He says that he (like very other worker) used to be searched when he left the site. Now the process has been revised, so that some workers are chosen randomly, he explains. The process has also been streamlined, so that workers don\u2019t spend unpaid time being searched, dragging down their wages to below minimum levels [not a worry for billionaire Mike Ashley, of course]. Sports Direct\u2019s investors have now finished voting on today\u2019s resolutions, so we\u2019ll have the results in a few hours. The entire room have now donned fluorescent jackets and headed out for a tour of the Shirebrook site. Nine months after the Guardian went undercover at Sports Direct, the company is now facing the full consequences of operating a \u201cDickensian\u201d warehouse in 21st century Britain. And owner Mike Ashley didn\u2019t appear to enjoy the experience at all, after his vision of creating a Selfridges-style retailer had an early encounter with reality. To recap.. Ashley has lashed out at the Unite union for criticising his offer of permanent contracts to casual retail staff. He accused it of \u201cshowboating\u201d, and alleged that Unite had contributed to the problems at Shirebrook. Ashley declared: This is probably your fault we are in this mess because we can\u2019t talk to you. I made a commitment to make a difference, I am trying, don\u2019t pull me down. I accept I have made some errors and I accept I can learn something. Please don\u2019t do the whole showboating thing, it will make me turn away and it\u2019s the people who work in Sports Direct who suffer.\u201d Yesterday Sports Direct committed to \u201cA developing dialogue with Unite to obtain their feedback.\u201d Ashley\u2019s performance threatens to undermine that commitment. Unite\u2019s Steve Turner also lashed the company over its use of agencies, who supply 4,000 workers to the company. They have helped to damage your company name, he told the board. Underfire chairman Keith Hellawell has promised to step down in 2017, if he doesn\u2019t enjoy the support of shareholders at next year\u2019s AGM. We learned this morning that he offered to resign over the weekend, but was told to stay on. Hellawell also admitted that Sports Direct\u2019s working practices had fallen far below acceptable standards. He told today\u2019s AGM that: We agree the system is not good enough, and we are going to improve it. But Sports Direct\u2019s largest independent shareholders are running out of patience. Standard Life has revealed it has voted against reappointing the board\u2019s non-executive directors. Euan Stirling, head of stewardship and environmental, social and governance investment at the group, wants a full review of the company. Stirling also demanded \u201ca group of talented and experienced executives\u201d to support and challenge Ashley, particularly from the Chairman\u2019s seat. The City is also disappointed that Sports Direct expects profits this year to be 20% lower than in 2015-16 (news that came at 7am). This has wiped 10% off the company\u2019s value this morning. The AGM is now over. Perhaps Mike Ashley\u2019s bad mood trumped his promise to say until midnight to answer questions. Investors are now voting on the various resolutions on whether to reappoint directors, and approve the pay report. Journalists are now heading out of the room, ready to experience the new Open Tour of Shirebrook. They\u2019re being serenaded out to \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u201d, by Journey: Campaigners for fairer pay are already planning to return to Shirebook in 2017 to mark Ashley\u2019s homework.... I\u2019m a little surprised that Mike Ashley lashed out at Unite, to be honest. Back in June, he was surprisingly open and engaging with MPs - a strategy that seemed to wrongfoot the BIS committee. That strategy might have worked well today too. My colleague Sarah Butler has a theory - that Ashley expected more praise, and less criticism, following the pledges made yesterday. Back to Sports Direct\u2019s pay policies....and Lisa Narthan of ShareAction UK asks if it might pay more than the minimum wage to staff. Hellawell replies that SPD wants to show leadership in this issue [having now resolved the issue, exposed by the Guardian, of paying less than the statutory minimum because of its security checks] Non-executive director Claire Jenkins has jumped to Ashley\u2019s defence, saying that Sports Direct has the \u201cmost open\u201d board meetings of any company she\u2019s worked at. And she denies that yesterday\u2019s report (written by Mike Ashley\u2019s lawyers) wasn\u2019t independent: Aviva, a significant shareholder, asks if there\u2019s any point discussing Keith Hellawell\u2019s position - as the company declined his resignation last weekend. Hellawell says \u201cyes\u201d (reminder, he\u2019s already promised to leave in 2017 if he loses a vote of confidence next year) Mike Ashley doesn\u2019t seem to be enjoying the AGM very much: Although Mike Ashley has lost his grip on his (Sports Direct-branded?) rag, his chairman is calmer. Keith Hellawell says the time for excuses is over, and that Sports Direct has reached a watershed moment. Grace Hetherington of ShareAction UK says it\u2019s quite a contrast: Here\u2019s the key quote from Ashley\u2019s outburst, after Unite questioned the value of his offer of permanent contracts to store staff: Oh dear. Mike Ashley\u2019s cheery mood has vanished, as the criticism from Unite\u2019s Steve Turner hits home. The Sports Direct founder (who still owns half the company!) has kicked off, saying the unions must take some blame for the abuses that were perpetrated at his warehouse. Ashley arguing that \u201cit\u2019s probably your fault that we\u2019re in this mess\u201d, claiming that he\u2019s not been about to talk to the unions about conditions onsite. It\u2019s caused quite a stir in the Auditorium.... Steve Turner of the Unite union asks why Sports Direct store workers are being offered a choice between a zero hours contract, and one only guaranteeing 12 hours a week. Many zero-hours workers are actually putting in a 40-hour shift each week, Turner says - so there\u2019s no incentive to take a new contract. And he lambasts Sports Direct for using thousands of agency workers at Shirebrook; blaming the agencies responsible for many of the problems onsite. What about the investigation into how Sports Direct paid staff less than the minimum wage? Hellawell says the inquiry into warehouse staff has been finished (and staff are being paid the money they\u2019re owed). But he also says that there are always conversations with the tax authorities -- perhaps over whether staff in its stores have been underpaid?... Mike Ashley insists he has nothing to hide, and promises (or threatens) to say until midnight to answer everyone\u2019s questions. But now we have Dave Singleton, an independent non-executive chairman, answering questions about operational problems at the company. Sports Direct are now taking questions from the floor, and facing a flurry of criticism and accusations. Another shareholder asks why Sports Direct hasn\u2019t operated a staff forum, or appraisals. Keith Hellawell admits that \u201cthe system isn\u2019t good enough\u201d and promises to improve it. Standard Life says it is voting against the board because the turnaround plan announced yesterday simply doesn\u2019t go far enough. It wants to see \u2018strong\u2019 independent directors who can challenge Mike Ashley, as well as help him run the company (which has been \u201cstarved\u201d of investment). Chief executive Dave Forsey doesn\u2019t seem to share Mike Ashley\u2019s perkiness. Forsey admits that Sports Direct needs to engage better with shareholders, and strengthen its corporate communications arm. That\u2019s on top of improving conditions for workers. NEWSFLASH: We understand that Standard Life, the second largest shareholder at Sports Direct, has voted against reappointing the company\u2019s non-executive directors. It has also voted against the pay report, my colleague Sean Farrell reports: Workers will be pleased to hear that a nurse and a welfare officer are (finally) being hired. Back in June, MPs heard that one Sports Direct worker actually went into labour on site, because she was afraid to take time off. Onto the scandalous conditions at Shirebrook. Hellawell admits that Sports Direct failed its staff -- and singles out the HR operation for particular criticism. He also confirms that the Six Strikes policy, which penalised staff for offences such as \u2018excessive toilet breaks\u2019 and \u2018chatting\u2019 has been axed. Hellawell says Sports Direct\u2019s directors genuinely want a worker to join them on the board (a move Ashley announced last night) He also defends using a company owner by Mike Ashley\u2019s brother, John, to deliver Sports Direct stock overseas -- a deal which one investor said \u201cdoesn\u2019t look very good\u201d.... Onto corporate governance issues - always a sticky subject for a company where the found owns 55% of the shares. Chairman Hellawell says the search for new independent directors is \u2018ongoing\u2019.... so no news of fresh heavyweight expertise to help steer the company. It sounds like Keith Hellawell is giving himself a 12 month window to win back the support of Sports Direct\u2019s investors. He says Sports Direct must become \u201ceven more transparent and over-zealous\u201d in the way it reports information (an area where the company has traditionally struggled). But there\u2019s no update on whether the company will appoint a permanent finance chief - a role which \u2018acting\u2019 CFO Matt Pearson has been conducting for more than two years! Chairman Keith Hellawell gets the AGM underway. He says he is committed to working with the parliamentary Business committee to implement Sports Direct\u2019s turnaround plan. But he would step down next year if shareholders vote against him. Ho ho ho Sports Direct\u2019s founder is in good spirits, apparently, as he arrives for his grilling from shareholders and other critics: Keith Hellawell, Sports Direct\u2019s chairman (despite his offer to quit) will address investors first: If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our story about how Hellawell tried to resign over the serious problems exposed at Sports Direct - but was told to stay on. Simon Neville of Buzzfeed tweets: A low shareholder turnout isn\u2019t too unusual, though. Large City investors will have cast their votes a few weeks ago, so don\u2019t actually have to vote in person. While we wait for the AGM to start, here\u2019s some comment from City lawyer Nick Elwell- Sutton of Clyde &amp; Co: \u201cWhile Sports Direct\u2019s decision to elect a worker to its board is designed may be a response to the report, the direction of travel is now turning towards worker representation at board level as is already common on the continent. This can be seen in TFL appointing a union representative to its board and the Prime Minister\u2019s policy statement in July that workers should be present on the boards of big business. Quite how successful this will be remains to be seen.\u201d True, it does. But the conditions at Sports Direct, which the Guardian exposed last December suggest it must help Mike Ashley turn the situation around. Shareholders and reporters are shuffling into their seats in the Auditorium* at Unit D of Sports Direct\u2019s HQ. (* - basically, a room in a warehouse) City chairmen are meant to be the ultimate power in the boardroom, with the power to sack a mere CEO if required. But Keith Hellawell\u2019s failed resignation attempt shows that Mike Ashley does things differently at Sports Direct. My colleague Graham Ruddick tweets: That also shows why Sports Direct might struggle to find a high-calibre replacement.... My colleague Sarah Butler will be covering the AGM action for us - here\u2019s the scene outside Sports Direct\u2019s HQ: Lisa Nathan of campaign group ShareAction is also there: This is from The Times\u2019s Deirdre Hipwell: The Sports Direct AGM kicks off (literally and metaphorically) in around 50 minutes, at 11am BST. According to the schedule, the board will spend 45 minutes presenting their report to shareholders, and the \u2018interested parties\u2019 who are also welcome to attend. A 30-minute question-and-answer session will follow -- although I\u2019m not sure that will be enough time for all the issues to be raised. Then the first tour of the Shirebrook warehouse will begin, followed (after a brief lunch) by the presentation (which you, dear readers, can see online here). MA = founder Mike Ashley; DF = Dave Forsey, the CEO, who was blamed for Sports Direct\u2019s mistakes in the review published yesteday. Boom! Another Sports Direct investor has announced it will vote against the board at today\u2019s AGM. It\u2019s pretty busy at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook HQ this morning, as executives and reporters arrive for the AGM. Chairman Keith Hellawell gave reporters a cheery \u201cMorning\u201d, but didn\u2019t discuss his resignation offer. SPD\u2019s employees have also been arriving for work: The Telegraph\u2019s Ashley Armstrong sums up the morning.... Sports Direct\u2019s shares are still being hammered in the stock market, and are currently down almost 10%. Investors aren\u2019t impressed by its warning of falling profits and chairman\u2019s Hellawell\u2019s failed attempt to resign. Analyst Joshua Raymond of XTB.com explains: \u201cInvestors rapidly sold out of Sports Direct shares as the UK market opened after a double whammy of bad news this morning. First and foremost, the retailer expects profits to fall by 20%, with underlying earnings expected around \u00a3300m, marking a fall of \u00a381m from a year ago. And secondly the fact the firm rejected Chairman Dr Keith Hellawell\u2019s resignation. Shareholders have long felt that the firm is held too tightly under Mike Ashley\u2019s grip and Chairman Hellawell has been unable to wield the sufficient power needed to make the radical changes required. So news of this rejection ultimately raises the feeling amongst larger shareholders such as Legal and General that Sports Direct will continue to operate with a Chairman that lacks sufficient influence.\u201d Here are some more slides from this afternoon\u2019s presentation, showing how Sports Direct will implement its turnaround plan: The prospect of Sports Direct becoming the new Selfridges has caused some mirth on social media... Mike Ashley is going to declare today that Sports Direct hopes to be the Selfridges of sports retail by the end of the decade. Yes, you read that right. Here\u2019s a slide from the presentation which Ashley will give at today\u2019s Open Day at 2pm (agenda here): We can\u2019t fault Ashley\u2019s ambition, in the face of the revelations of unacceptable working practices behind the scenes at Shirebrook. He recently set himself the target of emulating John Lewis - so Selfridges would be an even bigger stretch (Sports Direct Food Hall, anyone?). At this rate he\u2019ll be gunning for Harrods by Christmas.... Despite Sports Direct\u2019s efforts to turn over a new leaf, it is still employing Mike Ashley\u2019s daughter\u2019s boyfriend to run its property arm. The company says today that: As previously disclosed, our Property team will continue to be led by Michael Murray and any remuneration will be decided at the Board\u2019s discretion. Murray, who recently pulled off a \u00a3108m property deal on Oxford Street, could potentially earn 25% of the value created by his team. Some commentators have pointed out that he doesn\u2019t have immense experience, as he\u2019s only in his mid-twenties..... Mike Ashley insists that, despite much City chatter, he isn\u2019t planning to take Sports Direct private again. The company says: Further to the statement made in the Company\u2019s preliminary results announcement on 7 July 2016, and in response to repeated speculation, Mike Ashley has confirmed to the Board that it remains the case that he has no current intention to take the Company private, and has indicated his willingness for the Company to confirm this statement publicly. Our retail writer Sarah Butler explains why Sports Direct is less profitable.... Veteran retail analyst Nick Bubb is alarmed by Sports Direct\u2019s new profit forecasts: This chart shows how Sports Direct shares have taken an early dive: OUCH! Shares in Sports Direct have fallen sharply at the start of trading. They tumbled by up to 10%, before stabilising around 7% lower, at 325p. That more than wipes out yesterday\u2019s 5% rally. Investors clearly aren\u2019t impressed with the news that profits will fall by a fifth this year. The news that Keith Hellawell\u2019s resignation has been rejected may not have improved the mood, given that so many shareholders had demanded his departure. Sports Direct has also revealed that its profits will probably fall by 20% this year, in a statement to the City ahead of this morning\u2019s AGM. It now expects to post underlying earnings of around \u00a3300m this financial year, down from \u00a3381m in 2015-16. But that is also determined on achieving group sales growth of at least 9%, and only a small decline in profit margins. Sports Direct has just revealed that its chairman, Dr Keith Hellawell, offered to resign over the weekend! But the offer was rejected -- with SPD\u2019s board asking Hellawell to stay on and help improve the company. Here\u2019s the statement issued to the City a few minutes ago: Further to the Working Practices Report published by the Company yesterday, the Company announces that Dr Keith Hellawell QPM has been asked by the Board, which includes the Company\u2019s majority shareholder, Mike Ashley, to continue in his role as Chairman. Dr Hellawell had offered to step down over the weekend in the light of the shortcomings highlighted in the report, but he will stay in his role in order to assist with making further improvements. Hellawell, a former police chief constable and drug czar, has lost the confidence of some bigname investors recently - including Hermes, Legal &amp; General, Aberdeen Asset Management and Royal London. But crucially, not Mike Ashley (who still owns 55% of the company). On Monday, my colleague Nils Pratley argued that a responsible chairman would have noticed the problems at Sports Direct, including paying staff below the minimum wage: Hellawell may get credit for offering to walk the plank - but some investors will surely demand a change today..... Good morning. It\u2019s time for Sports Direct\u2019s board to face the music. After all the revelations about \u201cVictorian workhouses\u201d, \u201cgulag\u201d conditions and zero hour contract misery, Mike Ashley and his top lieutenants are about to hear from their critics as the troubled retail chain holds its Annual General Meeting with shareholders. And it promises to be an absolute zinger of an AGM, which starts at 11am. City investors and unions alike are lining up to blast the company, which has become associated with some of the worst business practices in modern Britain. Chairman Keith Hellawall will face particular criticism, with some big shareholders determined to vote against his re-election. Royal London Asset Management, for example, has warned that Hellawell\u2019s position was \u201cuntenable\u201d. As you probably already know, Sports Direct admitted yesterday that it had let its warehouse workers down badly. It is now offering all its shop staff permanent contracts -- but not the 4,000 agency staff at its Shirebrook site in Derbyshire -- and pledging to pay over the minimum wage. Late last night, Mike Ashley issued an apology to staff for the \u2018serious shortcomings\u2019 at his company, and promised to appoint a workers\u2019 representative to his board to help drive improvements. He said: \u201cI have always believed that Sports Direct was built by the great people who work here. I therefore wish to apologise to you on behalf of myself and The Board for the shortcomings that have occurred in our working practices, which have been identified in the report.\u201d Will that be enough to placate critics? Sports Direct is also holding an open day at Shirebrook, allowing people (including our reporters) to see conditions for themselves. Here\u2019s the order of business: We\u2019ll be tracking all the action at the AGM, and beyond, through the day....",

Please give us 12 months to fix it. What difference is 12 months?</p> <p>We\u2019ve done some good work in 90 days - lets do some fantastic work in 12 months.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>2) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/07/sports-direct-annual-general-meeting-showdown-mike-ashley-business-live?page=with:block-57d026ace4b042bbfb3243c0#block-57d026ace4b042bbfb3243c0\">Ashley also hinted that his own future is now on the line:</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the end, if I keep failing and keep failing and keep failing, it\u2019ll be best for everybody if I go. But give me some time to see if I can fix the problems first, please.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3)</strong> But City shareholders have lost patience with his boardroom sidekick, chairman Keith Hellawell. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/07/sports-direct-annual-general-meeting-showdown-mike-ashley-business-live?page=with:block-57d021eae4b042bbfb3243ab#block-57d021eae4b042bbfb3243ab\"><strong>A stunning 53% of independent investors voted against Hellawell\u2019s re-election, pushing for change at the top of the company</strong></a>.</p> <p>Hellawell claims he can regain their trust over the next 12 months, but will resign if he fails.</p> <p>Investors aren\u2019t impressed, though; Legal &amp; General have demanded a new chairman right away:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAt absolute minimum, we believe the current chairman should step down immediately and an external, independent appointment made to oversee management and protect the interests of all stakeholders \u2013 including employees, suppliers, and shareholders.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/sep/07/mike-ashley-pulls-out-wad-50-notes-during-sports-direct-security-check-video\">4) Sports Direct tried to win some support from the media, and investors, by allowing them to tour part of the Shirebrook site</a></strong>. But the takeaway moment from the trip was the pile of cash which emerged from Ashley\u2019s pocket. I\u201dm starting to suspect it may be a cunning ploy to distract us....</p> <p><strong>5) Earlier in the day, Ashley didn\u2019t do a brilliant job of keeping his cool during the company\u2019s annual general meeting.</strong></p> <p>The lowest point was when he blamed the Unite union for causing the problems at Shirebrook, and for \u2018showboating\u2019 by criticising his offer of permanent contracts for casual detail staff.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/07/sports-direct-annual-general-meeting-showdown-mike-ashley-business-live?page=with:block-57cffc60e4b0b2ee83375e83#block-57cffc60e4b0b2ee83375e83\">He declared</a></strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is probably your fault we are in this mess because we can\u2019t talk to you. I made a commitment to make a difference, I am trying, don\u2019t pull me down.</p> <p>I accept I have made some errors and I accept I can learn something. Please don\u2019t do the whole showboating thing, it will make me turn away and it\u2019s the people who work in Sports Direct who suffer.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>That outburst suggests that the pressure and criticism may be getting to Ashley. Perhaps he also hoped for more praise for his turnaround plan, which aims to emulate glossier retailers like Selfridge\u2019s.</p> <p>If so, he\u2019ll need to work minor miracles over the next 12 months to win bouquets from today\u2019s critics. It\u2019s not impossible - but with profits falling, Ashley will need all his retail skills to pull it off.</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s all from me tonight (although I may pop back later to add any new developments).

This was not a tour of the huge, bustling, Shirebrook warehouse where Guardian undercover reporters revealed last year how the company had broken the law by paying its workers less than the national minimum wage.</p> <p>Instead, the crowd of around 200 observers, all dressed in bright yellow hi-vis jackets, were shown around Sports Direct\u2019s spacious, brand new, facility, gleaming white walls and all. It even smelt new and freshly painted - meaning it was tempting to conclude that shareholders were actually witnessing a whitewash at the workhouse.</p> <p>Despite the pledges of a new transparency, the spectators barely saw any of Sports Direct\u2019s 4,000 warehouse workers (had they been abolished along with the six strikes and you\u2019re out policy?). And when workers were spotted, the visitors were separated from them by a line of large Sports Direct security staff. Not that that mattered. Those who broke through reported that the workers were unanimous: Shirebrook was actually a splendid place to work.</p> <p>If that felt strange, there were other peculiar differences too.</p> <p>The tannoy - which when the Guardian and Channel 4 had visited last year occasionally harangued staff - never barked any orders at all, either in English or Polish.</p> <p>And the only person to be searched was Mike Ashley himself....</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d04ce7e4b042bbfb32449a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T17:23:14.393Z\">6.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a video clip of Mike Ashley\u2019s search today -- for anyone who missed the fun and games earlier:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/sep/07/mike-ashley-pulls-out-wad-50-notes-during-sports-direct-security-check-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/523c9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2699091\"            data-video-name=\"Mike Ashley pulls out wad of \u00a350 notes during Sports Direct security check \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d04901e4b0b2ee83376001\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/07/160907mikeashley_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/07/160907mikeashley.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/07/160907mikeashley_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/sep/07/mike-ashley-pulls-out-wad-50-notes-during-sports-direct-security-check-video\">Mike Ashley pulls out wad of \u00a350 notes during Sports Direct security check</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d042cde4b0b2ee83375fe3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T17:14:14.800Z\">6.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8d98032f55b14e1079bce1588b4576606a3784b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8d98032f55b14e1079bce1588b4576606a3784b/0_0_3500_2367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sports Direct majority shareholder Mike Ashley leading a tour of the company\u2019s headquarters in Shirebrook.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sports Direct majority shareholder Mike Ashley leading a tour of the company\u2019s headquarters in Shirebrook.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d043cfe4b042bbfb324462\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-07T16:46:29.192Z\">5.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47e496b34852e52d81521a10d26c0096188b6b2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47e496b34852e52d81521a10d26c0096188b6b2f/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Ashley at Sports Direct HQ, Shirebrook.

And secondly the fact the firm rejected Chairman Dr Keith Hellawell\u2019s resignation. Shareholders have long felt that the firm is held too tightly under Mike Ashley\u2019s grip and Chairman Hellawell has been unable to wield the sufficient power needed to make the radical changes required.

      "bodyText": "After \u201cthe gulag\u201d \u2013 the name Shirebrook locals use to describe the Sports Direct warehouse \u2013 came glasnost. That was the message from Sports Direct as the embattled retailer held its much heralded \u201copen day\u201d during its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, when it treated investors and the media to a tour around its Shirebrook warehouse, which had been variously compared to something out of Dickens or a Soviet work camp. This was all part of the latest PR campaign by the sportswear retailer to rejuvenate an image shredded by a series of scandals relating to working conditions at its depot, which prompted the publication on Tuesday of an internal report into where the company had gone so wrong. Some of the report\u2019s findings made uncomfortable reading for the board, which was forced to apologise for \u201cserious shortcomings\u201d. But the document was billed as forming the basis of a supposed new era of candour from the company, before investors were led off to see for themselves. The show, however, was a disappointment. This was not a tour of the huge, bustling, Shirebrook warehouse where Guardian undercover reporters revealed last year how the company had broken the law by paying its workers less than the national minimum wage. Instead, the crowd of about 120 observers, all dressed in bright yellow hi-vis jackets, were shown around Sports Direct\u2019s spacious new facility, gleaming white walls and all. It even smelled new and freshly painted \u2013 meaning it was tempting to conclude that shareholders were actually witnessing a whitewash at the workhouse. Despite the pledges of a new transparency, the spectators barely saw any of Sports Direct\u2019s 4,000 warehouse workers (had they been abolished along with the \u201csix strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d policy?). And when workers were spotted, the visitors were separated from them by a line of large Sports Direct security staff. Not that that mattered. Those who broke through reported that the workers were unanimous: Shirebrook was actually a splendid place to work. If that felt strange, there were other peculiar differences, too. The tannoy \u2013 which when the Guardian and Channel 4 had visited last year occasionally harangued staff \u2013 never barked any orders at all, either in English or Polish. Meanwhile, the only person who was put through a security search was the billionaire founder, Mike Ashley. He emptied his pockets and out popped a huge wad of notes. \u201cEverything you will see today was not actually functioning 15 months ago,\u201d said Ashley \u2013 in what might have been viewed as another poke at his scapegoated chief executive, Dave Forsey \u2013 before he swiftly returned to his favourite point that the \u201csheer scale and size\u201d of his warehouses meant it was inevitable he would make mistakes. The new warehouse, which is around the same size as its controversial neighbour, is so hi-tech that it will soon be fitted with a conveyor belt to \u201cimprove the rate at which orders can be picked\u201d. \u201cThis will hugely speed it up,\u201d enthused the boss, as if he had stumbled on a startling technological discovery. \u201cIt\u2019s not available in the old warehouse.\u201d Well, quite. There, undercover reporters discovered last year that packers were walking close to 20 miles on each eight-hour shift. Many complained that the work they were being asked to do was impossible to fit into the timeframe agency bosses allowed them. Apart from the odd handheld scanner, the most advanced piece of technology on offer to many seemed to be a ballpoint pen. But if the shiny new warehouse was supposed to represent a glimpse of the shiny new Sports Direct, cracks did sometimes appear. Ashley, who had earlier completely lost his temper with Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, after the trade unionist had the temerity to ask a question, seemed to be continually fighting to keep his real emotions in check. He insisted he had acted as soon as he had read the Guardian\u2019s reports that the company was failing to pay the national minimum wage, after staff were held unpaid at the end of shifts to be searched. This was obviously wrong, he added, but then gave the impression of being rather irked that his company\u2019s legal breaches had been exposed. \u201cHe\u2019s not my favourite person, the Guardian man,\u201d he told his crowd. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d The question was later more apt in reverse, when Ashley went missing for an hour from the question-and-answer session, just as it was emerging that a majority of independent shareholders had voted against the reappointment of Keith Hellawell as chairman. The spirit of openness did not extend to giving a reason for his absence, although even Ashley\u2019s harshest critics might struggle to accuse him of hiding. The billionaire, once described as the UK\u2019s answer to the reclusive Howard Hughes, was giving a rare television interview.",

But the document was billed as forming the basis of a supposed new era of candour from the company, before investors were led off to see for themselves.</p> <p>The show, however, was a disappointment. This was not a tour of the huge, bustling, Shirebrook warehouse where Guardian undercover reporters revealed last year how the company had broken the law by paying its workers less than the national minimum wage.</p> <p>Instead, the crowd of about 120 observers, all dressed in bright yellow hi-vis jackets, were shown around Sports Direct\u2019s spacious new facility, gleaming white walls and all. It even smelled new and freshly painted \u2013 meaning it was tempting to conclude that shareholders were actually witnessing a whitewash at the workhouse.</p> <p>Despite the pledges of a new transparency, the spectators barely saw any of Sports Direct\u2019s 4,000 warehouse workers (had they been abolished along with the \u201csix strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d policy?). And when workers were spotted, the visitors were separated from them by a line of large Sports Direct security staff. Not that that mattered. Those who broke through reported that the workers were unanimous: Shirebrook was actually a splendid place to work.</p> <p>If that felt strange, there were other peculiar differences, too.</p> <p>The tannoy \u2013 which when the Guardian and Channel 4 had visited last year occasionally harangued staff \u2013 never barked any orders at all, either in English or Polish.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the only person who was put through a security search was the billionaire founder, Mike Ashley. He emptied his pockets and out popped a huge wad of notes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/sep/07/mike-ashley-pulls-out-wad-50-notes-during-sports-direct-security-check-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/523c9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2699091\"            data-video-name=\"Mike Ashley pulls out wad of \u00a350 notes during Sports Direct security check \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57d04901e4b0b2ee83376001\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/07/160907mikeashley_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/07/160907mikeashley.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/07/160907mikeashley_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/sep/07/mike-ashley-pulls-out-wad-50-notes-during-sports-direct-security-check-video\">Mike Ashley pulls out a wad of \u00a350 notes during Sports Direct security check</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cEverything you will see today was not actually functioning 15 months ago,\u201d said Ashley \u2013 in what might have been viewed as another poke at his scapegoated chief executive, Dave Forsey \u2013 before he swiftly returned to his favourite point that the \u201csheer scale and size\u201d of his warehouses meant it was inevitable he would make mistakes.</p> <p>The new warehouse, which is around the same size as its controversial neighbour, is so hi-tech that it will soon be fitted with a conveyor belt to \u201cimprove the rate at which orders can be picked\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis will hugely speed it up,\u201d enthused the boss, as if he had stumbled on a startling technological discovery. \u201cIt\u2019s not available in the old warehouse.\u201d</p> <p>Well, quite. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">There, undercover reporters discovered last year that packers were walking close to 20 miles on each eight-hour shift</a>.</p> <p>Many complained that the work they were being asked to do was impossible to fit into the timeframe agency bosses allowed them. Apart from the odd handheld scanner, the most advanced piece of technology on offer to many seemed to be a ballpoint pen.</p> <p>But if the shiny new warehouse was supposed to represent a glimpse of the shiny new Sports Direct, cracks did sometimes appear.</p> <p>Ashley, who had earlier completely lost his temper with Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, after the trade unionist had the temerity to ask a question, seemed to be continually fighting to keep his real emotions in check.</p> <p>He insisted he had acted as soon as he had read the Guardian\u2019s reports that the company was failing to pay the national minimum wage, after staff were held unpaid at the end of shifts to be searched.</p> <p>This was obviously wrong, he added, but then gave the impression of being rather irked that his company\u2019s legal breaches had been exposed.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my favourite person, the Guardian man,\u201d he told his crowd. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p> <p>The question was later more apt in reverse, when Ashley went missing for an hour from the question-and-answer session, just as it was emerging that a majority of independent shareholders had voted against the reappointment of Keith Hellawell as chairman.</p> <p>The spirit of openness did not extend to giving a reason for his absence, although even Ashley\u2019s harshest critics might struggle to accuse him of hiding. The billionaire, once described as the UK\u2019s answer to the reclusive Howard Hughes, was giving a rare television interview.</p>",

Barratt Developments, Redrow and Berkeley Group, three of the UK\u2019s top 10 housebuilders, said they had seen little sign of a lasting post-referendum slump. In a statement accompanying its financial results for the year to the end of June, Barratt said the outcome of the EU referendum had heightened economic and political uncertainty. But the chief executive said Barratt\u2019s performance at the start of the new financial year had been largely unaffected by the Brexit vote, adding that the company was taking a \u201cbusiness-as-usual stance\u201d. \u201cIt [Brexit] is just no longer a point of discussion [between sales representatives and customers],\u201d David Thomas said. \u201cThere\u2019s strong consumer demand, good mortgage lending and that\u2019s allowing us to build and sell plenty of homes.\u201d His comments, issued alongside results showing a 21% rise in pretax profits to \u00a3682m for the year leading up to the referendum, echoed similar assessments by rival firms. Redrow, which this week reported annual pre-tax profits up 23% to \u00a3250m, said: \u201cWe have seen very little impact as a result of the Brexit vote.\u201d Berkeley Group was the only one of the three to give a detailed account of its Brexit strategy alongside a trading statement for the four months to the end of August. The firm said it had deferred the release of new homes on to the market and that reservations for new homes fell 20% in the run-up to the referendum. But it said the overall Brexit impact since the vote had been minimal. \u201cAfter a hiatus either side of the referendum, the market in August, traditionally a quiet month, has returned to the relative levels reported for the first five months of the year,\u201d said Berkeley. \u201cPricing has remained resilient and above business plan levels with reservation cancellation rates at normal levels, following a temporary and expected increase after the UK referendum result.\u201d All three of the housebuilders had previously predicted that long-term factors underpinning the strength of the UK housing market would make it relatively resistant to a Brexit vote. In a statement issued less than a week after the referendum result, Redrow said: \u201cThe fact remains that there is a long term underlying demand for new homes following decades of under supply. This chronic shortage of housing leaves market fundamentals unchanged.\u201d Berkeley, which wanted Britain to remain in the EU, said in the run-up to the referendum that London \u201cwill always be a world city and a highly desirable place to live, work and play\u201d. In July, Barratt warned that it might slow its housebuilding rate as a result of the Brexit vote, triggering a slump in its share price. But it also said the housing sector was fundamentally strong thanks to government support, good mortgage availability and undersupply of new homes.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley, Sports Direct\u2019s founder and majority shareholder, has blamed the Unite union for the company\u2019s problems in an angry outburst at the retailer\u2019s annual shareholder meeting. In a packed meeting of more than 120 people at the head office in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, Ashley was challenged by the union\u2019s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, over a pledge to offer shop-floor staff 12-hour contracts instead of zero hours. Turner said he would not be surprised if few workers took up the offer as most were working much longer hours every week. Ashley told Turner that the 12-hour promise did not mean Sports Direct would reduce hours for those who worked longer. He said: \u201cThis is probably your fault we are in this situation because we can\u2019t talk to you in an open manner. \u201cI\u2019ve made a commitment to make a difference and I\u2019m trying so don\u2019t pull me down. Don\u2019t do the whole showboating thing. It will make me turn away and the only people who suffer are people that work at Sports Direct.\u201d Ashley\u2019s comments came as Sports Direct faced an angry response from shareholders and employees attending its annual meeting despite the embattled retailer\u2019s pledges to treat workers better and improve its corporate governance. Investors criticised chairman Keith Hellawell and majority owner Ashley for the way the company was run while union representatives cast doubt on a commitment to improve working practices. Shareholders are seeking to unseat Hellawell for presiding over a deteriorating financial performance and conditions at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse at Shirebrook that MPs have likened to a Victorian workhouse. A string of major investors, including Hermes Investment Management, CalPERs, CALSTRS and the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan have all come out in opposition to him. The UK investors Legal &amp; General, Aberdeen Asset Management and Royal London have also lost patience with Hellawell, the former chief constable of West Yorkshire police who has been chairman since 2009. Sports Direct said before the meeting that Hellawell had offered to resign at the weekend but then agreed to stay on. The company also warned that profits would fall heavily this year, by about 21% as margins shrink, costs rise and it spends more on buying property. This sent its shares down more than 10% on Wednesday morning, however, by lunchtime they had recovered to be only 6% down. Hellawell offered to quit before the company released a critical report on working conditions on Tuesday and with most big shareholders\u2019 votes cast before the AGM. He told the meeting that the board had asked him to stay to lead a change in working practices, but he would stand down if the majority of independent shareholders voted against him at next year\u2019s AGM. Hellawell said Sports Direct had reached a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d and told the meeting: \u201cYou can be assured that things will improve as we move forward.\u201d Speaking afterwards, Hellawell told the Guardian that Sports Direct\u2019s board had not moved to make changes earlier, despite years of criticisms, because they had not been given correct information about working conditions. \u201cWe were acting on the information we had,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct.\u201d Euan Stirling, head of stewardship at Standard Life, Sports Direct\u2019s biggest shareholder after Ashley, told the meeting his company had voted against Hellawell and all his fellow non-executive directors. He said: \u201cWe are longstanding shareholders in the company and have engaged with senior executives and non-executives over many years, sadly to little effect. The responses to our inquiries have been either unconvincing or non-existent.\u201d Stirling said Standard Life, which holds 5.8% of Sports Direct shares, believed Ashley, who is executive deputy chairman, should stay on the board but that the rest of the board needs strengthening, particularly the \u201ccrucial role of chairman\u201d. The \u00a322bn railway industry pension fund, meanwhile, said it had voted against all the board. Chris Hitchen, the fund\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIt is a serious decision not to support an entire board. However \u2026 we have lost all confidence that the board of Sports Direct is acting in the interests of all shareholders.\u201d Sports Direct \u2013 which has admitted to problems at its warehouse, including a \u201csix strikes\u201d policy that put workers in fear of losing their jobs \u2013 made a series of concessions to staff before the meeting. These included guaranteed hours for shop workers on zero-hours contracts and a pledge to put a worker\u2019s representative on the board. It stopped short of guaranteeing hours for more than 4,000 workers at its Shirebrook warehouse, where the Guardian uncovered a climate of fear and employees effectively working for less than the minimum wage. Hellawell told the AGM that Sports Direct had failed its employees and said: \u201cWe will stop anything we believe is unfair to our workforce.\u201d An employee also confronted Ashley with claims about sexual and racial harassment. Sports Direct is bringing in a nurse and a welfare officer at Shirebrook and a whistleblowing system after vowing \u201czero tolerance\u201d of harassment. The retail analyst Nick Bubb said of the earlier profit warning: \u201cToday\u2019s news of falling profits and soaring capital expenditure [with no board changes and no take-private move by Mike Ashley] will bring the City down to earth.\u201d The views of investors other than Ashley will be hard to ignore after the City regulator introduced changes to voting rules which, in some circumstances, can give greater sway to the views of minority investors. Last year, Hellawell\u2019s position as chairman was secure because he was supported by Ashley, who controls 55% of shares. Non-executive directors require a majority of independent shareholders to be reappointed. After a series of scandals and poor trading, more investors are expected to oppose Hellawell after 28% voted against his re-election or abstained last year. Sports Direct said it would spend about \u00a3300m on buying and developing property this year. It said Michael Murray, the boyfriend of Ashley\u2019s daughter and a commercial property novice, would continue to head the real-estate division. In a presentation for an \u201copen day\u201d at Shirebrook, the company said it wanted to be seen as the \u201cSelfridges of sports retail\u201d. Big suppliers such as Adidas and Nike have grown weary of the bargain basement feel of Sports Direct\u2019s stores and have favoured its rival JD Sports with their top trainers. Sports Direct sought to quash speculation that Ashley, who owns 55% of the company, would capitalise on the depressed share price by buying back all of the business he founded in 1982.",

The Panama Papers are the biggest leak ever: 12.7m documents from the offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca. They amount to a who\u2019s who of the international rich. They include details of the real or \u201cbeneficial\u201d owners behind anonymous offshore companies. The leak includes passport scans, addresses, and email chains, typically between the firm, which has offices around the world, and other lawyers and banks. In short, a goldmine for any ambitious tax inspector. Who is the source? We don\u2019t know. In 2015 an anonymous source approached Bastian Obermayer, a reporter with Germany\u2019s S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. Over the next 12 months, the source gave Obermayer Mossack Fonseca\u2019s entire internal database, updated in real-time instalments. After the Panama Papers were published the source wrote a manifesto, suggesting his motives were idealistic: to expose wrongdoing. The source called himself John Doe. It\u2019s unclear if John Doe has now sought to cash in on the leak by selling selective chunks of information to European and other governments, or if the source is someone else. Has this happened before? Yes. In 2014, the German government paid just under \u20ac1m for a previous \u2013 and much smaller \u2013 Mossack Fonseca leak. This led to a series of raids on those customers of Commerzbank, Germany\u2019s second largest bank, whom the authorities suspected of tax evasion. In 2006-07, Herv\u00e9 Falciani took data from inside HSBC\u2019s Swiss subsidiary. It showed how HSBC helped wealthy customers dodge tax. After fleeing to France, Falciani gave the HSBC files to French authorities. They shared them with other countries, including the UK. In January, British tax authorities admitted they had not prosecuted anybody. Will other countries buy the data? Probably. Denmark\u2019s tax minister, Karsten Lauritzen, says another government put him in touch with the anonymous source. This means the source has approached at least one other tax authority. Germany is a likely candidate. In the past, several EU countries, including Belgium, have taken a tough approach to tax offenders. David Cameron did hold an anti-corruption summit in London following the Panama Papers revelations, but the UK has generally been reluctant to pursue offenders or investigate offshore leaks. It has so far not questioned employees at Mossack Fonseca\u2019s UK office. The firm has closed branches in Jersey and the Isle of Man.",

      "bodyText": "Amazon is taking on Deliveroo, Uber and Just Eat by entering the growing market for delivering restaurant food to busy Londoners. Customers in certain London postcodes can order meals from restaurants using an Amazon app. Amazon promised free delivery within an hour on orders of \u00a315 or more and no mark-ups on restaurants\u2019 standard prices. The Amazon Restaurants service is only available to customers of Amazon\u2019s Prime service, which costs \u00a37.99 a month or \u00a379 a year, and offers unlimited one-day delivery, free music streaming and other services. Amazon listed more than 100 restaurants including large operators such as Strada, specialist chains like the Middle Eastern-themed Comptoir Libanais and the Michelin-starred Indian restaurant Benares, based in Mayfair. Amazon\u2019s move pits the US online retailer\u2019s financial power against established operators in the market for delivering restaurant food to time-strapped Londoners with cash to spend. Deliveroo launched in 2013 and has about 3,000 riders delivering for restaurants in London. Its riders went on strike last month over changes to their pay that they said would make them worse off. Other competitors in the market include Just Eat, which operates nationally and puts diners in touch with about 30,000 UK restaurants, and UberEats, owned by Uber, the taxi-hailing app. Neil Campling, an analyst at Northern Trust Capital Markets, said Amazon\u2019s move would shake up the market because it has the money and technology to grab business in a growing market. It could put pressure on Just Eat, which has been increasing the charges it makes to restaurants for its service, he said. Campling said: \u201cThe bullish thesis on Just Eat is a perception that Amazon will have little impact on Just Eat as their focus is on the restaurant delivery market in London rather than, say, delivering a kebab in Barnsley on a Tuesday night. Time will tell but Amazon doesn\u2019t do small scale over time and nor does Uber.\u201d Even as real incomes have been squeezed after the financial crisis, business has boomed for restaurant deliveries as time-constrained consumers, particularly in London, have ordered in food. Britain is predicted to spend almost \u00a38bn a year on pizzas, curries and other takeaway meals by the end of this decade. Amazon\u2019s service will at first deliver to busy London locations such as the City and West End, Whitechapel, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea and Southwark but it said there are plans to expand coverage. Al Wilkinson, head of Amazon Restaurants UK, said: \u201cBased on our own research into what is important to consumers in food delivery, our team have hand-picked a selection of the best quality local restaurants in London. We\u2019re excited to be helping many of these small businesses start offering home delivery for the very first time.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Manufacturing output slumped in July at its fastest pace in a year as factories restricted production in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. The car industry was among just a handful of sectors to expand, while textiles and metal production fell and pharmaceutical manufacturing dived. A broader measure of industrial production inched higher, but only after a long recession in the quarrying and mining sector came to an end and the low value of the pound sent oil exports higher. The Office for National Statistics data confirmed a range of industry surveys showing that manufacturers had been hit hard by the EU vote . But a turnaround in manufacturing output was recorded by the Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI, which rose to 53.3 in August from 48.3 in July, where a figure below 50 indicates contraction. That was the joint largest month-to-month jump in the survey\u2019s nearly 25-year history, and was leapt on by Brexit campaigners who said it showed the fears surrounding the no vote were misplaced. The ONS said manufacturing was the only sector to contract from the previous month, falling by 0.9% with the largest contribution from pharmaceuticals. \u201cHowever, this was offset by growth in the other three sectors, particularly mining and quarrying, which increased by 4.7%,\u201d it said. But the size of the fall in manufacturing restricted growth in the production sector, which includes agriculture, electricity supply and paper production, to just 0.1% month on month. In the three months to July 2016, total production and manufacturing output increased by 1.0% and 0.5% respectively on the previous three months. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said: \u201cThe data confirm indications from business surveys that the vote to leave the EU on 23rd June had an immediate damaging impact on the economy. \u201cHowever, while PMI data had also indicated a sharp fall in factory output in July, the surveys have since shown a strong rebound in August as the initial shock of the EU referendum passed.

He said: \u201cThe continued failure to address some of these deep-rooted issues has left the sector increasingly exposed to economic uncertainty at home and challenging global conditions. \u201cThe priority for the upcoming autumn statement must be to boost business confidence by addressing the UK\u2019s creaking infrastructure and supporting businesses to invest, hire and grow,\u201d he added.

      "bodyText": "The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, has warned against erecting barriers to trade and immigration when automation and technology are more to blame for job losses and slow wage growth. In a speech defending an open economy at the Crescent Institute on Wednesday, Bowen called for policies to combat inequality, which he said would help policymakers defend globalisation and its benefits. Bowen noted the rising tide of protectionist and anti-immigrant sentiment around the world, including in the US and Britain\u2019s desire for \u201cisolation\u201d from Europe. He said in Australia the trends could be seen in the return of Pauline Hanson whose \u201ccurrent attacks on Islam [have replaced] her prejudices against Asians and Aborigines in the 1990s\u201d. Minor parties are \u201ccrowded\u201d with those that blame trade more than immigration, he said. Bowen warned populist stances were harmful because open trade and immigration had contributed to more than 25 years of continuous economic growth in Australia. \u201cLiving standards \u2013 as measured by national income per person \u2013 have grown by 60% over the last 25 years,\u201d he said. Bowen noted that household goods were cheaper than ever due to imports, including electronics being 90% cheaper than 25 years ago. Luxury items were now \u201ccommonplace in most households around Australia\u201d. \u201cIt is estimated that the tariff cuts put in place by the Hawke/Keating government have put nearly $4,000 into the pockets of average Australian households.\u201d Bowen said that migrants come to Australia and work hard, making them \u201ca vital part of the success of the postwar years\u201d. Immigration would lead to a 5.9% gain in GDP per capita in the next 35 years, according to the Migration Council. Bowen argued it was simplistic to blame trade for the decline in manufacturing because automation and technology \u2013 though they boost productivity \u2013 have played a large role making jobs obsolete. He argued that \u201cfaster and more instantaneous dissemination of information and services\u201d meant that services sector jobs could also \u201cbe traded at light speed with the tap of a keyboard\u201d. \u201cAutomation threatens the jobs of all working people.\u201d Bowen questioned how erecting trade barriers could prevent job losses from technology. Policymakers should \u201cbetter identify the cohort of people and industries struggling with the changes\u201d, he said, and suggested the Productivity Commission or a similar body to regularly report on how trade reforms, technology and automation benefit communities. \u201cThis work would importantly also allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the people, industries and regions that are adversely affected or displaced from the increasingly rapid change from the new wave of globalisation.\u201d The shadow treasurer advocated \u201cmore investment in relevant education, training and industry plans\u201d rather than \u201creturning to the old days of hoping that protection can prop us up, when it actually drags us down\u201d. Bowen conceded the open economy was not \u201cworking well for everyone\u201d. \u201cNational income per person, in other words our living standards, is almost 2% less than where it was three years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cFor two years, many Australians have grown progressively worse off, not better off. We\u2019ve seen this crystalise in the lowest wages growth on record in Australia.\u201d Bowen said he cared about income inequality, social mobility and inclusiveness from a moral point of view as a progressive but also because they \u201c[make] it easier to defend globalisation and an open economy\u201d. He said decline in trade union membership was \u201cat least in part\u201d to blame for low wages, and the result of generations of \u201cunion bashing\u201d. Bowen said voters who feel the economy isn\u2019t working for them wanted greater representation, as seen in gains by Labor in Tasmania, Nick Xenophon in South Australia and Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation. \u201cThe last thing our economy needs is a retreat to protectionist isolationism. We can and we must win that argument,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let\u2019s listen as we do so, and make sure that Australians who currently feel excluded are included. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure that our growth is more inclusive and our nation fairer.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Australian economy has completed 25 years without a recession after the national accounts showed that the economy grew 3.3% in the year to June. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, trumpeted the result and described it as \u201ctribute to every Australian who has gone out there, gone to work, got a job, that is running or has started a business\u201d. But Wednesday\u2019s figures showed that growth in the June quarter had halved to 0.5% compared with the March quarter, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics said consumer and government spending were propping up other areas of the economy. \u201cGrowth in the June quarter was driven by domestic final demand, which rose 0.6%, supported by ongoing growth in household and public consumption,\u201d the ABS said. At a media conference in Canberra, Morrison said public final demand had been boosted by the government listing hepatitis C drugs on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the $180m procurement of Chinook helicopters. Final household consumption grew 0.2% in the June quarter in seasonally adjusted terms. Morrison said he was particularly concerned about the weakness of household consumption, describing the figure as \u201cwell below what we have seen for the last few quarters\u201d. \u201cIt tells us that we have to be very mindful of the sensitivity of the economy in the circumstances that exist globally,\u201d he said. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said Labor welcomed the headline result and the record 25 consecutive years of growth. But he said Australians would be \u201cconcerned\u201d that the rate of growth had halved and the remainder was \u201clargely the result of government spending\u201d. Economists noted that Australia\u2019s 100 straight quarters of growth since the last recession ended in 1991 showed that it was closing in on the record 103 consecutive quarters of growth recorded by the Netherlands. With annual growth at a seasonally adjusted 3.3% in the June quarter, the economy was growing at its fastest in four years, said CommSec\u2019s chief economist, Craig James. \u201cAnnual growth has lifted to four-year highs. Australia has now notched up 100 quarters without a recession,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Netherlands holds the record for the longest expansion at 103 quarters. Over the next year Australia should pick up the gold medal for the longest economic expansion of a developed economy. \u201cInflation stands at 1%. Interest rates stand at 1.5%. Unemployment stands at 5.7%. The mining construction boom may be over, but it has been replaced by a housing construction boom. There is much to like and celebrate about Australia\u2019s economy.\u201d The ABS said compensation of employees rose by a modest 0.5% in the June quarter to be 3.1% higher through the year. It follows slow growth in number of hours worked (0.7%) and the wage price index (2.1%). Morrison said Australia needed incomes to grow, not because of a wages explosion, but \u201coff the basis of improved growth in the economy and improved productivity\u201d. \u201cWe want to see household incomes lift. We want to see company profits lift.\u201d Asked how the government could help boost incomes, Morrison nominated asset write-offs for small businesses, competition policy, tax cuts, startups and the innovation agenda. \u201cIt is no one thing, it is a product of economic policy which is designed to try and get regulation off the back of business, to have more competitive tax regime to enable them to get ahead.\u201d Other features of the accounts included flat investment, where continued reduction in engineering construction in the mining sector was offset by growth in public investment. The ABS said international trade detracted from growth in the quarter owing to strong growth in imports and a slowing in the rate of growth in exports. The terms of trade growth of 2.3% in seasonally adjusted terms was the first increase since December 2013, it said. Asked how the figures would impact the budget, Morrison said he would update the projections in the middle of the financial year, but noted commodity prices were \u201cvery consistent with what [they were] at the time of the budget\u201d. Both revenue growth and expenditure cuts were contributing to the long-term aspiration to balance the budget, he said. \u201cThe percentage of revenue as a share of the economy is projected to increase ... at a greater rate than expenditure as a share of the economy is projected to fall.\u201d He said this showed revenue growth was contributing to budget repair but it was not doing so due to tax rises. Morrison said the government could not control some factors contributing to revenue, such as the terms of trade, but could control its expenditure. He warned that the ratings agencies were not convinced \u201cthat this parliament is actually going to support expenditure restraint\u201d. The Australian dollar slipped slightly on the ABS announcement, falling to US76.56c from a morning high of US76.89c.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco, WPP and Berkeley Group are among the lowest-ranked companies for corporate governance according to a report released as companies are facing pressure to rein in runaway pay and show commitment to wider society. The Institute of Directors (IoD), which published the report, warned companies to improve how they are run after a year in which excessive pay for bosses and a string of scandals has once again battered the reputation of corporate Britain. Tesco came bottom of the rankings of FTSE 100 companies. The supermarket chain was brought down by the lowest scores for accounting and audit practices that were largely a hangover from an accounting scandal and a series of profit warnings in the past two years. WPP, the world\u2019s biggest advertising company, was ranked 96. Its weak point was pay after the company handed its founder and chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell \u00a370m for last year, prompting a third of shareholders to oppose one of Britain\u2019s biggest paydays at WPP\u2019s annual general meeting in June. Berkeley, the upmarket London housebuilder, was 99th due to weak board effectiveness and low scores on pay and shareholder relations. The company, which is due to drop out of the FTSE 100, paid founder and chairman Tony Pidgley \u00a321.5m for 2015 after awarding him \u00a323.3m the year before. But fewer than 13% of shareholders voted against the pay report at Tuesday\u2019s AGM. Rolls-Royce, once one of Britain\u2019s most respected companies, was also rated a lowly 93rd after a series of profit warnings and allegations of illegal payments that are under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. Corporate governance \u2013 how companies and boards operate and deal with shareholders, workers and customers \u2013 has shot up the political agenda amid disquiet about inequality and remote business elites. Big shareholders, under pressure to take a stand, rebelled over pay at AGMs this year including a majority vote against the \u00a314m deal for BP\u2019s chief executive Bob Dudley. Theresa May has promised to rein back executive pay and has threatened to place workers on boards to make companies act in the interests of society and the economy. City institutions and business people have admitted the gap between those at the top and the rest of the populace contributed to the vote for Brexit. Oliver Parry, head of corporate governance policy at the IoD, said: \u201cCompanies need to own this now. You have got to get to grips with your corporate governance because if you don\u2019t then policymakers will regulate you more. \u201cWe are saying to companies: \u2018You have still got an opportunity to sort it out for yourselves.\u2019\u201d The IoD released its report as Sports Direct prepared to face angry shareholders at its AGM on Wednesday. The Guardian\u2019s investigation into working practices at the company added to existing concerns about its corporate governance and the dominance of founder and majority owner Mike Ashley. The resulting slide in the company\u2019s shares caused Sports Direct to fall out of the FTSE 100 list of Britain\u2019s most valuable companies in March, excluding it from the IoD\u2019s list. On Tuesday Sports Direct tried to win over shareholders by promising a governance review by a City law firm. The IoD\u2019s survey rated companies on board effectiveness, audit and risk, pay, and relations with shareholders and other stakeholders. It also factored in the opinion of its members \u2013 company secretaries, accountants and other groups \u2013 about companies\u2019 governance. The highest ranked company was British American Tobacco (BAT), whose top score on governance measures held up against a relatively low perception ranking of 42. Others in the overall top 10 included Unilever, Next and Royal Mail. Parry said BAT\u2019s perception score was low because tobacco companies have a bad reputation and it showed companies need to do better at behaving well and getting their message across. The IoD, which has 34,500 members, has traditionally been to the right of its rival the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), but it has been a fierce critic of high pay and unaccountable bosses \u2013 which, it argues, threaten the legitimacy of capitalism. The report was the IoD\u2019s second annual survey into corporate governance. Last year Britain\u2019s banks were all in the bottom 20 along with Sports Direct. This year Barclays was the only bank in the bottom 20 though banks did badly in the perception survey.",
