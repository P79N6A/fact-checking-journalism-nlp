      "bodyText": "Oil prices fell over 3% on Wednesday after new data showed US crude supplies continuing to grow while Saudi Arabia promised to keep up its policy of pumping its wells flat out. A barrel of benchmark Brent crude was changing hands for $36.58 at one stage, leaving it on track to end 2015 30% lower as demand failed to keep up with supply. The latest fall \u2013 in touching distance of 11-year lows \u2013 should be good news for motorists and many industries but will unnerve companies and their suppliers who depend on North Sea exploration and production. Saudi Arabia and its Opec partners had hoped their tactic of keeping volumes up would drive out of business its new American shale oil competitors, but the tactic has failed so far. Output from the shale heartlands of Texas and Pennsylvania did fall from a peak in April this year but has stabilised since as producers have ways to reduce costs and increase efficiency. Latest numbers released by the US government\u2019s Energy Information Administration showed local production had risen again \u2013 by 23,000 barrels a day to reach 9.2m barrels in the week to Christmas Day. Meanwhile refinery stockpiles of oil also increased \u2013 by 2.6m barrels \u2013 with the help of additional imports. Analysts had expected a 1m barrel decline which would have put gentle upward pressure on the price of Brent and the local West Texas intermediate blend, which was down 3% also at $36.70. But there was a defiant message from Saudi Arabia, which has encouraged the Opec cartel not to cut its output targets in a bid to raise prices and instead try to win market share by offering the same amount of cheap oil. \u201cIt is a reliable policy and we won\u2019t change it,\u201d the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, told the Wall Street Journal, on the sidelines of an event in Riyadh. \u201cWe will satisfy the demand of our customers. We no longer limit production. If there is demand, we will respond. We have the capacity to respond to demand,\u201d he said. Pressure on oil companies could be seen on the London Stock Exchange with the BP and BG share prices down 1.5% while Shell\u2019s value fell 1%, dragging down the wider a FTSE 100 index. The fall in wholesale oil prices has been partly passed on to motorists in the way of lower fuel costs. Leading supermarkets in Britain cut their prices of petrol in the run-up to Christmas, taking petrol below \u00a31 per litre. Lower oil prices have put downward pressure on gas prices because many gas contracts are linked to the price of crude. This should mean lower household bills eventually, while prolonged depressed oil prices also means fewer jobs in North Sea production centres such as Aberdeen.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Ocado dived more than 3% after fears that the online grocer faces increased competition from Amazon and is struggling to sign up an international partner. The British retailer took a hit on Wednesday after Amazon said this week it would rapidly expand its grocery delivery service in the UK. Ocado shares have now fallen 8% since Christmas Eve, closing at 315p on Wednesday. Amazon Pantry, which launched in November, offers a range of 4,000 grocery and household products, from big brands such as Kellogg\u2019s, Ariel , Colgate and Kronenbourg. The company charges \u00a32.99 for the delivery of one large box of goods to people signed up to its Prime subscription service. Christopher North, the UK boss of the online retailer, told the Guardian this week that Amazon was \u201creally happy with the early numbers,\u201d on Pantry in the UK. It plans to add thousands more products over the coming months. The service is seen as a first step towards Amazon upgrading its delivery service in the UK to fresh food, which would provide a more direct challenge to UK supermarkets, and Ocado. Analysts said Amazon\u2019s focus on London added further pressure on Ocado, which has a strong customer base in the capital. Investors and analysts had speculated that Amazon might seek to buy Ocado as a shortcut into the British grocery market, but the US company\u2019s determination to build its own service indicates that a bid is unlikely. Amazon\u2019s UK grocery ambitions have also compounded fears that the British company could face competition in marketing its IT and warehouse technology to other retailers. Ocado had expected to sign up retail partners who would use its systems outside the UK by the end of this year. Ocado has been linked to deals with France\u2019s Carrefour and US group Safeway as part of plans to extend its business. But with just one day to go before 2015 is up, the retailer looks unlikely to meet its ambition. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly the last day of the year and there\u2019s been no deal and so some people are giving up saying it\u2019s never going to happen,\u201d said Bruno Monteyne at Bernstein Research. \u201cOcado is not priced as a food retailer. It\u2019s priced as a technology company but if the tech opportunity gets smaller and the food is under pressure from Amazon the share price is going to suffer.\u201d Since signing a deal to handle online deliveries for Bradford-based retailer Morrisons, Ocado it would sign similar agreements with retailers outside the UK to use its technology. The Morrisons deal transformed the view of Ocado, sending its share price soaring. But sales growth at the online grocer has been affected by a bitter price war between the supermarkets as they try to fend off competition from the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl. Earlier this month, Ocado boss Tim Steiner described a challenging and competitive grocery retail environment, but he said he expected Ocado to continue to outperform the rest of the online grocery market.",

Retail sales growth will slip back to around 1.7% in 2016 from about 1.8% this year, according to the KPMG/Ipsos retail thinktank, despite the fact that most consumers have more money in their pockets. But people are now looking to spend their money on restaurants, pubs and cinemas as well as on trips to the high street. \u201cConsumers are looking beyond retail for goods and services to spend their money on,\u201d said panel member Maureen Hinton, an analyst at consultancy Conlumino. \u201cThis is making it much harder for an oversubscribed retail sector. Leisure, culture, entertainment have shown much stronger growth than retail over the past five years and this trend is being exacerbated by an ageing population.\u201d Pubs, restaurants, hotels and other leisure activities have enjoyed strong growth in 2015 \u2013 up 11.4% according to credit and debit card operator Barclaycard, while supermarkets have found the going tough.

Amazon is also ramping up its food delivery services in the UK \u2013 with plans to add more products to its Pantry range and rumours that it will launch fresh food in 2016. \u201cVolumes are not rising enough to support all this expansion and there has to be some consolidation in the sector to take out the excess supply,\u201d Hinton said. Meanwhile, the KPMG/Ipsos thinktank believes homeowners will put spare cash towards paying off the mortgage and paying tradesmen to update their properties rather than spending more on clothing or food in 2016. With such a tough environment, the thinktank said it would be difficult for retailers to put up prices to offset cost increases resulting from the implementation of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, which comes into force in April, as well as rises in business rates \u2013 a combination Tesco boss Dave Lewis has described as a \u201clethal cocktail.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Rolls-Royce has said the prospect of making engines for narrow-bodied aircraft is very attractive but warned that the cost of re-entering the market would be significant. The comments from Warren East, who took over as boss of the manufacturing group in July, have been interpreted by analysts as meaning that the company would only return to the booming market for planes that carry up to 200 people, through a major corporate deal. There has been speculation in the City that Rolls-Royce could look to buy back into a joint venture with its rival Pratt &amp; Whitney, which it left in 2012. In return, the US company would likely seek a major stake in Rolls-Royce\u2019s wide-bodied business, which makes engines for the Airbus A380 superjumbo. Rolls-Royce has struggled after issuing five profit warnings in less than two years, and its share price has fallen by almost half since late April. The Derby-based group has blamed its profit warnings on a collection of factors, including falling demand for corporate jets and the slump in the price of oil hurting customers in the energy industry. However, at the centre of its troubles is the decision to pull out of making engines for narrow-bodied aircraft to focus on wide-bodied planes such as the A380, the A350 XWB, and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Since then, orders for wide-bodied aircraft have slowed, while the narrow-bodied market is booming thanks to the demand for the A320neo and the Boeing 737 Max. This means that General Electric and Pratt are outperforming the British company. East made his comments about the market for small planes in a presentation to investors at the end of November. In the presentation East warned that there was a \u201csignificant cost of re-entry so [the] business case would need to be compelling\u201d. However, he also said that Rolls-Royce was still making money from servicing engines on older narrow-bodied planes and could develop new engines for the generation of planes that will replace the A320 and the 737. These new aircraft will not enter service until around 2030, and Rolls-Royce said it would make a decision on whether to try to develop engines for those products in the early 2020s. But East insisted that Rolls-Royce does not have to re-enter the narrow-bodied market. \u201cThe big question, I think \u2013 and there\u2019s been a lot of debate that I\u2019ve heard since joining the business \u2013 is \u2018so what about narrow-body in the future\u2019 and \u2018surely you have to be in narrow-body in the future\u2019? I think the answer is \u2018no, we don\u2019t\u2019. We don\u2019t have to be in narrow-body in the future. It\u2019s a great opportunity at some stage when it arises. But right now, there isn\u2019t an opportunity. There is no opportunity for us to enter this business until the early 2030s. There\u2019s maybe a little bit of discussion about a sort of quasi wide-body opportunity maybe five years ahead of that. \u201cSo this is actually not something that we should be wasting our time on right now in terms of debating. We don\u2019t actually need to do anything right now other than enjoy the aftermarket [engine servicing] revenue and work on making sure that we\u2019re earning that aftermarket revenue as efficiently as possible and maximising the profit opportunity on that over the next several years. Developing our technology and taking advantage of an opportunity if and when an opportunity arises, that is essentially the position for now on narrow body.\u201d After pulling out of narrow-bodied planes, a decision made by former boss Sir John Rose, Rolls-Royce has been able to focus on wide-bodied aircraft, which typically hold 250 people or more. It is on course to claim a 50% share of the market by 2020, up from 30% today. The company is the exclusive supplier for the A350. However, pulling out of the narrow-bodied market has hurt Rolls-Royce\u2019s sales volumes, leaving its factories short of work. East is attempting to cut costs by up to \u00a3200m a year in a bid to get the company back on track. The level of concern about the future of Rolls was underlined this month when it emerged the government has drawn up contingency plans to nationalise its nuclear submarine business or force it to merge with defence manufacturer BAE Systems in the event the company\u2019s performance worsens. The government has a golden share in Rolls-Royce meaning it can block any takeover and prevent a foreign investor owning more than 15% of the company. ValueAct, an activist investor based in California, has built a 10% holding in Rolls-Royce and wants a seat on the board. On top of Rolls-Royce\u2019s operational problems, it is mired in a Serious Fraud Office investigation about bribery allegations in China, Indonesia, and other parts of the world.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u201cIt was amazing how quickly the cold shoulder came on.\u201d Richard Murphy, tax expert and father of Corbynomics, has heard nothing lately from Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s right-hand man, John McDonnell. Back in the summer, when he was propelled into the political limelight by the Corbyn leadership campaign, which was keen to show it had a coherent economic platform, Murphy began to assume he would take a senior role in Labour\u2019s shadow Treasury team. He addressed raucous campaign rallies, telling the assembled crowds that it was time to ditch what he calls the economic doctrine of Tina \u2013 \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d. \u201cThey basically withdrew from discussing economy policy: they let me do it,\u201d he says. One friend inside Labour even began referring to him teasingly as Professor Lord Murphy, as though Corbyn might ennoble his economic guru. But once Corbyn clinched the leadership, he handed the key role of shadow chancellor to McDonnell, who quickly drafted in a seven-member panel of heavyweight economic advisers, including the American Nobel prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, and the French superstar Thomas Piketty \u2013 but not Murphy. He says the idea of making him a special adviser was mooted, as Labour MPs gathered for their conference in Brighton in September. But nothing materialised. \u201cThere was no formal offer,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat became fairly clear was that I would have been some form of special adviser. That\u2019s not a job for a 57-year-old. Am I temperamentally suited to being the behind-the-scenes guy who isn\u2019t noticed in public? Probably not.\u201d So as the year draws to a close, the author of The Joy of Tax has returned to doing what he has done successfully for many years: campaigning for a fairer tax system, from his home in Downham Market, Norfolk. He has got another book in the works and recently took up a professorship at City University in London. Asked to recall the heady days of last summer, when he suddenly became the impromptu spokesman for a political movement that was sweeping the country \u2013 or at least, the Labour party \u2013 he sounds wistful. \u201cIf you\u2019re a creator of ideas, you\u2019re always delighted if someone wants to pick them up and use them,\u201d he says. \u201cOne day in July, I got a phone call saying, would I come and speak at the launch of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s economic policy. I said: \u2018Why me? You know I\u2019m not a member of the Labour party.\u2019 They said: \u2018Have you seen the document?\u2019\u201d When he was sent a copy of The economy in 2020, the radical policy pamphlet that had already been sent off for publication, \u201cI looked through it and I realised that 70% of it could have been cut and pasted off my blog.\u201d He was irritated \u2013 and remains so \u2013 about how his ideas were presented without nuance. He spent a lot of time, for example, explaining that only a proportion of the \u00a3120bn \u201ctax gap\u201d, between what companies owe the tax authorities and what they actually pay, would be recoverable in practice, and doing so would necessitate considerable upfront investment in Revenue &amp; Customs. He says: \u201cI have always said there was no way you would be able to get it all: that point didn\u2019t come over clearly.\u201d Instead, the pamphlet describes the \u00a3120bn as \u201cenough to double the NHS budget; enough to give every man, woman and child in this country \u00a32,000\u201d. Another of Murphy\u2019s central ideas \u2013 so-called people\u2019s quantitative easing \u2013 became one of the most talked-about aspects of Corbyn\u2019s leadership bid. Murphy now says this idea, of funding public investment through electronically created money, could be kept on the shelf for the next economic downturn. People\u2019s QE was a distinctively Corbynite twist on the idea of green QE, which was conceived by Murphy together with a group of economists and environmental campaigners, the green new deal group, as a way of paying for the radical restructuring required to tackle climate change. But during the leadership campaign, the idea sometimes appeared to lay Corbyn open to the charge that he would be reckless with the public purse-strings; and it has been barely mentioned since. \u201cJeremy\u2019s very keen on investment, and seemed to think this would help fund it. Would I have put it in the document in the way it was in the summer? No,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cIt needed to be made clear that this was a policy that would work best when there is no market for UK gilts [government bonds], and at the moment there is a very buoyant markets for UK gilts. I would have written a more balanced policy document.\u201d He stresses that he never became a fully paid-up member of Team Corbyn. \u201cI didn\u2019t join the Labour party; I didn\u2019t even pay \u00a33 to vote for Jeremy. I just talked about my ideas.\u201d But he remains proud of his role in opening the political space for a different conversation about austerity and its consequences: \u201cIf I have done anything over the past few years, it is to create this alternative narrative.\u201d Since Labour gave him the \u201ccold shoulder\u201d, he has been talking to the Green party and the Scottish National party. But he can\u2019t help lamenting the fact that Labour appears to have gone quiet on economic policy, surrendering some of the ground he hoped had been won over the summer. \u201cLabour doesn\u2019t appear to be using Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election as the best chance to create a real narrative of its own,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cI am concerned, yes, but I have seen nothing so far says that what I was suggesting, and what they borrowed from me, is not their policy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It has been a pretty glum day on European stock markets, in the wake of the 2% slide in Brent crude oil prices towards 11-year lows. IMF chief Christine Lagarde\u2019s warning of disappointing global growth next year added to the sombre mood. The FTSE 100 index in London is down nearly 50 points, or 0.8%, at 6265.66 The Dax in Frankfurt has slid almost 120 points, or 1.1%, to 10,743.01 The CAC 40 in Paris has lost 23 points, or 0.5%, to 4678 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is down 0.3% at 17,674.86 the Nasdaq is down 0.4% at 5087.39 the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.3% at 2072.98 Away from the financial markets, Apple has agreed to pay \u00a3234m to settle an Italian tax dispute and UK house prices accelerated to an eight-month high in December, according to Nationwide building society, which is predicting further rises of 3-6% next year, even if interest rates go up as expected by the summer. Thank you for all your great comments. We will be back tomorrow. Yesterday\u2019s rally in oil prices (sparked by colder temperatures in Europe and north America) proved to be short-lived. Brent crude is sliding again towards 11-year lows after Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister said the kingdom \u2013 the world\u2019s top oil producer \u2013 had no plans to scale back production. The comments from Ali al-Naimi, coupled with slowing global energy demand (partly due to China\u2019s slowing economy) and record high inventories, put further pressure on oil prices. Brent crude, the world benchmark, is down 1.6% on the day at $37.19 a barrel while New York crude has lost 2% to $37.11. Soaring output from the OPEC cartel, Russia and the US has created a global oil glut of between half a million and 2 million barrels a day, sending crude prices plummeting. They have lost two thirds since the middle of last year. According to the Wall Street Journal, al-Naimi told reporters: We will satisfy the demand of our customers. We no longer limit production. If there is demand, we will respond. We have the capacity to respond to demand.\u201d PricewaterhouseCoopers has issued its latest estimates for the cost of the winter floods across the UK, calculating a total economic cost of more than \u00a33bn. Meanwhile, accountants at KPMG have put the cost of the floods at over \u00a35bn. Mohammad Khan, general insurance leader at PwC, explained: The effects of continuing torrential weather are set to hit parts of the UK even harder. Our latest estimates now suggest that economic losses due to Storms Eva and Desmond will be \u00a31.6 billion - \u00a32.3 billion, with insured losses of between \u00a3900m - \u00a31.2bn. However, these projections do not include any hovernment spend on flood defences which we understand may be between \u00a32.3bn and \u00a32.8bn. Also, these estimates do not currently include the impact of Storm Frank. Based on the currently available information, our understanding is that Desmond and Eva combined had at least 11,500 houses flooded which combined with the commercial insurance losses we are expecting is the driver of our insured loss estimate. Given that Storm Frank is ongoing it is far too early to tell what the full impact will be. However, given 16,500 homes and businesses have already been left without power by Storm Frank in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the North of Scotland, the total economic loss caused by the three Storms may well breach \u00a33bn.\u201d PwC also noted that traditionally commercial insurance claims have made up about 10-30% of the total insured losses, but this time business claims will account for about half of the total. Many smaller businesses don\u2019t even have insurance, because they simply can\u2019t afford it after the financial crisis and recession and previous floods in 2009. Barclaycard has also issued some figures on \u2018touch and go\u2019 spending, following data from the UK Cards Association earlier. According to the credit card provider, contactless spending in service stations, pubs and bars has almost doubled since the limit rose from \u00a320 to \u00a330 in September. Spending in fast food outlets and supermarkets has shot up by 62%. More than 8 in 10 consumers use less cash than they did a year ago, and 19% are annoyed if they can\u2019t pay using contactless cards or devices. Financial markets remain sluggish, with just one more trading day to go this year. The FTSE 100 index is down 25 points, or 0.4% at 6289.04. The eurozone is a bit more mixed; the Dax is still in the red by 46 points, a 0.5% fall, whilst the CAC has made a bit of a comeback, with a 5 point increase. Connor Campbell, financials analyst at Spreadex, says With Brent Crude now even closer to falling back below the $37 per barrel mark (only needing to drop around 10 cents to break that barrier with the US crude inventories still to come) the FTSE had a battle on its hands this morning... The index still has to deal with a sliding supermarket sector, however, with Ocado Group dropping another 5% after yesterday\u2019s announcement from Amazon that the online giant would be expanding its UK grocery delivery service Pantry. Things look unlikely to improve during the American session this afternoon. The Dow Jones is currently on track for a 20 point drop when the bell rings on Wall Street, with only pending home sales (expected at 0.6% against 0.2% last month) to distract investors from the generally gloomy atmosphere.\u201d Deflation eased in Spain in December, to 0.1% from 0.4% in November, suggesting inflation across the eurozone could inch higher in December, economists say. Spain received a record 64.6m foreign tourists in the eleven months to November, 4.8% more than in the same period in 2014, according to official data. Most of them came from the UK (14.97m, up 4.1%), followed by France (10.9m, up 8.9%) and Germany (9.86m, down 0.8%). This puts the country on track for a record 65m foreign tourists in 2015. In November alone, 3.7m international tourists went to Spain, up 10.7% year-on-year. Apple has reached a \u20ac318m settlement with Italy\u2019s tax office, Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported. Italy\u2019s tax office said it had reached a deal with the American tech giant in a dispute over taxes but declined to comment on details. La Repubblica reported hat Apple agreed to pay \u20ac318m. An agency spokesman told Reuters: Apple has agreed to our request.\u201d Italian prosecutors have been investigating allegations that Apple failed to pay corporate taxes totalling \u20ac879m. After months of negotiations, the tax authorities agreed to close the case in return for a cheque for \u20ac318m. Other multinational companies have been using cross-border corporate structures to reduce their tax bills. Apple Italia is part of the company\u2019s European operation which is headquartered in Ireland, a country with one of the lowest levels of corporation tax in the European Union. Ireland taxes corporate earnings from normal business activities at a rate of 12.5%, which compares with a standard 27.5% rate in Italy, according to AFP. Contactless card transactions now account for one in 10 card payments in Britain \u2013 the first time that milestone has been passed. Figures from the UK Cards Association show there were 120.5m contactless card payments in October in the UK. This equates to 10.3% of all card transactions \u2013 up from 3.7% a year ago. A total of \u00a3929.8m was spent using contactless cards in October. The average value of a contactless payment was \u00a37.72, up from \u00a37.35 in September when the limit for a single payment was raised to \u00a330. Overall spending on debit and credit cards rose by 0.9% in October to reach \u00a353.2bn. Richard Koch, Head of Policy at The UK Cards Association, said: With one in 10 card payments now contactless, it\u2019s clearly the preferred way to pay for millions of consumers. The rise in the contactless limit to \u00a330 earlier this year means there are now even more opportunities to make a fast, easy and secure contactless payment.\u201d RBS Economics have done this handy graphic showing regional variations in house prices this year. In London, shares in online grocer Ocado have fallen sharply for a second day, after a Guardian story sparked concerns over growing competition from a rival service at online giant Amazon. Ocado shares fell nearly 8% in early trading and are now down 6.5% at 304.6p. My colleague Graham Ruddick reported that Amazon is preparing to crank up the pressure on Britain\u2019s struggling supermarkets by dramatically expanding the range of grocery products it sells. Christopher North, the UK boss of the online retailer, said it plans to expand its Pantry service rapidly in the new year. Amazon Pantry, which launched in November, allows customers to buy from a range of 4,000 grocery and household products, from big brands such as Kellogg\u2019s, Ariel, Colgate and Kronenbourg. Ukraine plans to continue talks with Russia in January over a $3bn Eurobond which Kiev has threatened not to repay, Ukrainian finance minister Natalia Yaresko said today, Reuters reported. Ukraine has included the two-year bond, which matured on 20 December, in external commercial debt it is restructuring to shore up its war-torn economy. But Russia has refused to accept these terms, arguing the bond is an official country-to-country loan, not commercial debt. China\u2019s foreign exchange regulator said that it would improve its policy reserves and contingency plans to curb risks from abnormal cross-border capital flows. The country\u2019s outstanding foreign debt totalled $1.53 trillion at the end of September, down from $1.68 trillion at the end of June, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said. China\u2019s surprise moves to devalue the yuan in mid-August sparked a wave of capital outflows, as investors fretted that its economy might be slowing more sharply than previously thought. Bloomberg is reporting that China has suspended at least two foreign banks from conducting some cross-border yuan operations until late March. In the film Groundhog Day, Bill Murray plays a weatherman who finds himself in a time loop reliving the same events. Well anyone involved in the oil industry must think they\u2019ve joined Bill in the film. The end of this year feels remarkably similar to the end of last year, with oil prices collapsing again, writes independent City analyst Louise Cooper. Currently the price of a barrel of Brent crude is $37, a fall of 35% since the summer. A year ago, in December 2014, crude cost more - about $65 - but it had also fallen around 35% since the summer. And for both 2014 and 2015, the final collapse of the crude price was caused by a disorderly meeting of the oil producing cartel, OPEC, at the beginning of December, Cooper notes. If this Oil Groundhog Year continues, then oil companies are likely to repeat last year\u2019s reaction to cheaper crude: announcing large cost cutting, slashing investment and issuing profit warnings. The oil firms announced this at the same time as releasing their 2014 full year results in January, February and March. If the oil prices stays at $37, they may well be forced to do the same in the opening months of next year. Last week Shell released the documentation for investors for its merger with BG Group. The most telling fact was that Shell is assuming an oil price of $50 in 2016 and $65 in 2017. The majority of city analysts are also as optimistic that oil prices will rise from current levels. According to Bloomberg the average Brent crude forecast is still $54 in 2016 and $61 in 2017. However all these forecasts look extremely high in the context of a current oil price of just $37. The problem is that the crude price fall has been so quick, the oil industry has been slow to adjust, just like last year. And the city analysts that scrutinise the industry are also \u201cbehind the curve\u201d. They are all playing catch up again. There are some pessimists. Goldman Sachs warns there is a risk of crude falling to $20 next year and some traders are betting on crude as low as $15. I am old enough to remember $9 oil (in December 1998) and during most my early career in the 1990s, Brent cost between $18 and $20. Adjusting for inflation would take Brent to about the current level. It may be that the high oil price of up to and over $100 of recent years that was the aberration and we are just returning to the longer term lower price. Analysts at ExaneBNP Paribas warned recently that for global oil firms there is a \u201cclear risk of dividend cuts which is far from fully priced into the shares\u201d. Adding that the \u201cEuropean oil sector will be paying dividends out of debt until 2018 at the earliest\u201d... The bond (debt) markets are also suggesting that the risk of bankruptcies in the global oil industry is rising significantly as the oil price falls.\u201d There is a theory that all IPOs are priced between 10% and 20% below their intrinsic value and the latest performance statistics back up this thinking. We calculate the average share price gain for all IPOs [in London] in 2015 is 11.4%, writes Daniel Coatsworth at Shares magazine (\u00a3). European stock markets are trading lower this morning, as weak commodity prices are weighing on miners and energy companies. Yesterday stock markets around the world put in a strong performance, buoyed by a near-3% rise in the price of Brent crude. The FTSE 100 index in London is down 0.7%, or 41 points, at 6273.22. The CAC in Paris has lost 0.4%, or nearly 18 points, to 4683.51 The Dax in Frankfurt has slid 0.5%, nearly 50 points, at 10,810.49. The Ibex in Madrid has slipped 0.3%, or 33 points, to 9637.5 Veteran investor Warren Buffett is headed for his worst year relative to the rest of the US stock market since 2009, with shares in his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway down 11% so far this year, the Financial Times reports. Berkshire has been hit by the commodities slump. The underperformance comes in Mr Buffett\u2019s Golden Anniversary year at the helm, when he told investors for the first time that they should judge his record based on Berkshire\u2019s share price, rather than just the book value of the company, which had been his preferred yardstick for decades. Mr Buffett urged them to make that judgment based on the long term, rather than on a single year, reflecting investing mentor Benjamin Graham\u2019s view that the stock market may be a \u201cweighing machine\u201d in the long run, but in the short term it is a \u201cvoting machine\u201d. But in 2015, the market has been voting negatively on Berkshire\u2019s prospects for weathering the decline in commodity prices, according to Jim Shanahan, analyst at Edward Jones. Although Berkshire has no oil and gas subsidiaries, its railroad business transports oil, coal and agricultural products, and its manufacturing arm sells products to the shrinking oil industry. Weak results from Berkshire\u2019s insurance divisions in the middle of the year may also be due to lower oil prices, Mr Shanahan said, since lower petrol prices mean drivers and truckers are on the road for longer and having more accidents. \u201cThey are impacted by the weak resources sector and commodity prices in general,\u201d he said. You can read the full FT story here (\u00a3). Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight, has looked at the Nationwide house price figures. The stronger Nationwide data for December reinforce our belief that house prices are likely to see solid increases over the coming months. We expect house prices to rise by around 6% over 2016 amid healthy buyer interest (supported by largely decent fundamentals) and a shortage of properties.\u201d Nationwide said the gap between average house prices in the north of England and those in the south widened by \u00a323,000 during 2015, as the south continued to outperform the rest of the country. Returning to Lagarde\u2019s comments, she wrote in a guest article for Handelsblatt: In many countries the financial sector still has weaknesses and in emerging markets the financial risks are increasing. All that means global growth will be disappointing and uneven in 2016.\u201d She said that low productivity, ageing populations and the lingering effects of the global financial crisis were putting the brakes on growth. She also warned that rising US interest rates (while necessary) and a stronger dollar could lead to firms defaulting on payments which would affect banks and the wider economy. We have done a big piece on oil \u2013 \u201cRecession, retrenchment, revolution? Impact of low crude prices on oil powers\u201d from our correspondents around the world. Take a look. A glut of oil, the demise of Opec and weakening global demand combined to make 2015 the year of crashing oil prices. The cost of crude fell to levels not seen for 11 years \u2013 and the decline may have further to go. There have been four sharp increases in the price of oil in the past four decades \u2013 in 1973, 1979, 1990 and 2008 \u2013 and each has led to a global recession. By that measure, a lower oil price should be positive for the world economy, with lower fuel costs for consumers and businesses in those countries that import crude outweighing the losses to producing nations. But the evidence since oil prices started falling from their peak of $115 a barrel in August 2014 has not supported that thesis \u2013 or not yet. Oil producers have certainly felt the impact of the lower prices on their growth rates, their trade figures and their public finances butthere has been no surge in consumer spending or business investment elsewhere.\u201d UK house prices rose 4.5% year-on-year in December, up from November\u2019s annual growth rate of 3.7%, according to Nationwide. It expects the housing market to strengthen further next year, even if the Bank of England starts hiking borrowing costs from next summer as expected. Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said: As we look ahead to 2016, the risks are skewed towards a modest acceleration in house price growth, at least at the national level, despite the likelihood of interest rate increases from the middle of next year.\u201d He predicted house prices would rise 3-6% over the next 12 months. London was again the fastest-growing region in 2015, with a house in the capital costing 12.2% more in the fourth quarter than a year earlier. Good morning and welcome back to our live blog covering financial markets and business and economics news from around the UK and the world. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has warned that global growth will be disappointing next year. Writing in German newspaper Handelsblatt, she said the prospect of rising interest rates in the US and the economic slowdown in China are contributing to uncertainty. She added that the normalisation of US monetary policy and China\u2019s shift to a new growth model are necessary and healthy, but stressed that they needed to be done as efficiently and smoothly as possible. In the UK, house price growth hit an eight-month high in December, according to mortgage lender Nationwide. It said house prices rose 0.8% this month, the biggest monthly increase since April. The average price of a house reached \u00a3196,999. In November prices edged up 0.1%.",

Brent crude is sliding again towards 11-year lows after Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister said the kingdom \u2013 the world\u2019s top oil producer \u2013 had no plans to scale back production.</p> <p>The comments from Ali al-Naimi, coupled with slowing global energy demand (partly due to China\u2019s slowing economy) and record high inventories, put further pressure on oil prices. Brent crude, the world benchmark, is down 1.6% on the day at $37.19 a barrel while New York crude has lost 2% to $37.11.</p> <p>Soaring output from the OPEC cartel, Russia and the US has created a global oil glut of between half a million and 2 million barrels a day, sending crude prices plummeting. They have lost two thirds since the middle of last year.</p> <p>According to the Wall Street Journal, al-Naimi told reporters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will satisfy the demand of our customers.

Our latest estimates now suggest that economic losses due to Storms Eva and Desmond will be \u00a31.6 billion - \u00a32.3 billion, with insured losses of between \u00a3900m - \u00a31.2bn.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>However, these projections do not include any hovernment spend on flood defences which we understand may be between \u00a32.3bn and \u00a32.8bn. Also, these estimates do not currently include the impact of Storm Frank. <br></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Based on the currently available information, our understanding is that Desmond and Eva combined had at least 11,500 houses flooded which combined with the commercial insurance losses we are expecting is the driver of our insured loss estimate. Given that Storm Frank is ongoing it is far too early to tell what the full impact will be. However, given 16,500 homes and businesses have already been left without power by Storm Frank in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the North of Scotland, the total economic loss caused by the three Storms may well breach \u00a33bn.\u201d<br></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>PwC also noted that traditionally commercial insurance claims have made up about 10-30% of the total insured losses, but this time business claims will account for about half of the total. Many smaller businesses don\u2019t even have insurance, because they simply can\u2019t afford it after the financial crisis and recession and previous floods in 2009.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"505bb06f2626cfb5cd9edb438eae2c96ae8d1672\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/505bb06f2626cfb5cd9edb438eae2c96ae8d1672/0_0_4333_2600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flooding in Straiton, Scotland, as Storm Frank begins to batter the UK on its way towards flood-hit areas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flooding in Straiton, Scotland, as Storm Frank begins to batter the UK on its way towards flood-hit areas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5683d3d2e4b0629150aaf625\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-30T12:59:41.154Z\">12.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Barclaycard has also issued some figures on \u2018touch and go\u2019 spending, following data from the UK Cards Association earlier.</p> <p>According to the credit card provider, contactless spending in service stations, pubs and bars has almost doubled since the limit rose from \u00a320 to \u00a330 in September.

A year ago, in December 2014, crude cost more - about $65 - but it had also fallen around 35% since the summer.

The oil firms announced this at the same time as releasing their 2014 full year results in January, February and March. If the oil prices stays at $37, they may well be forced to do the same in the opening months of next year. <br></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Last week Shell released the documentation for investors for its merger with BG Group. The most telling fact was that Shell is assuming an oil price of $50 in 2016 and $65 in 2017. The majority of city analysts are also as optimistic that oil prices will rise from current levels. According to Bloomberg the average Brent crude forecast is still $54 in 2016 and $61 in 2017.<br></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>However all these forecasts look extremely high in the context of a current oil price of just $37. The problem is that the crude price fall has been so quick, the oil industry has been slow to adjust, just like last year. And the city analysts that scrutinise the industry are also \u201cbehind the curve\u201d. They are all playing catch up again. <br></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>There are some pessimists. Goldman Sachs warns there is a risk of crude falling to $20 next year and some traders are betting on crude as low as $15.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am old enough to remember $9 oil (in December 1998) and during most my early career in the 1990s, Brent cost between $18 and $20.

      "bodyText": "In early October, a little more than a hundred people gathered in an unlikely event space in New York City to talk about farming. They discussed water usage and efficient transportation, the price of LEDs and intellectual property concerns. This was the first time the event, dubbed Indoor Ag Con, was held in New York, and it brought together the founders of alternative farming companies like BrightFarm, Aerofarms and Gotham Greens alongside technologists, lighting experts and researchers. Indoor agriculture refers to an increasingly popular form of crop cultivation that happens inside, making it less of a traditional farm and more of a manufacturing facility. Where traditional farms rely on irrigation systems, soil and sunlight, indoor farms use LEDs or high pressure sodium lamps, and grow in hydroponic or aeroponic systems. Without bugs, proponents say, pesticides can be reduced and the overall product is not only more controlled but healthier. Critics, however, warn that indoor agriculture is an energy-intensive way for companies to take over areas of food production where family farms and small businesses have excelled in recent years, as demand for local, organic products has increased. Indoor agriculture is still in its infancy, but the CEO of Chicago-based FarmedHere, Matt Matros, signals a new type of food entrepreneur. Like a lot of people in the industry, Matros comes from a non-agriculture background. He worked as a brand manager at Kraft Foods, then went on to found the restaurant chain Protein Bar. After selling the company, he went on a sabbatical abroad, which got him thinking about the lack of access to fresh produce in many areas around the world. That landed him at FarmedHere, founded in Illinois in 2011. Now in a 90,000 square-foot facility in Chicago\u2019s Bedford Park, the largest indoor farm in North America uses aquaponics to produce organic herbs and leafy greens, distributed to grocery stores and restaurants in the Chicago area. And they\u2019re looking to grow even bigger. \u201cIt\u2019s been a number of hobbyists who have scraped together a few thousand [dollars] to make an indoor farm and have tried to make it a little bit bigger and a little bit bigger,\u201d says Matros. \u201cBut there\u2019s no one really professionalizing it or automating it, or fully putting capitol towards making big farms to feed lots of people. And I think the industry is about to tip.\u201d He hopes to do so by becoming the local farm for every community in the country. Matros is planning to open about 20 new facilities across the US that serve consumers within a 200-mile radius. \u201cEach farm is fully modular. I joke that each farm is like a Lego block and you just need to drop it wherever you want to put a farm,\u201d Matros says. \u201cWe have these Lego boxes and we know how they work and we just have to put them together and drop them.\u201d In each region, Matros hopes the company can work with local farmers to incorporate their goods into FarmedHere\u2019s distribution. In Florida, for example, they could work with citrus farmers; in New York, with dairy farmers. While Matros plans to capitalize on the demand for local produce, the manufacturing feel of indoor farms contradicts the bucolic, idealized version of what consumers envision. There are no young families strolling through the windswept furrows under the bright sun. When Matros explains what it\u2019s like to walk through the facilities, he likens it to a Costco, but instead of pallets of Huggies or Cheerios, it\u2019s full of beds of plants bathed in purple-hued LED lights. \u201cWe build farms that are sort of like Disneylands of farming,\u201d he says. \u201cConsumers in each municipality can really feel like they\u2019re part of the community, and see where their food is being grown. It\u2019s similar to a farmers\u2019 market where you go and meet the farmer and see pictures of the operation.\u201d With the company\u2019s expansion will come new crops and products. At the moment, FarmedHere grows greens and herbs. \u201cNo pun intended, but it\u2019s low hanging fruit for indoor farming,\u201d Matros says. The next phase is to start making value-added products like salad dressings to get more mileage out of the crops. With this kind of progress, FarmedHere moves even further from being a traditional farm, entering the food manufacturer realm. While Matros hopes to one day grow more challenging crops, like avocados, the system still needs perfecting. While LED efficiency is increasing, the energy it takes to simulate sunlight and maintain proper temperatures is huge. It\u2019s not hard to find people who don\u2019t believe that indoor farming is a panacea. In a presentation this September, Bruce Bugbee from Utah State University\u2019s Department of Plants, Soils and Climate made the case that the fossil fuels needed to support the crops would add up to about $400,000 per acre. And even though lights are getting more efficient, the amount of solar panels needed would take up about five times the area as the cropland itself. Lou Albright, professor emeritus at Cornell University estimated in a February 2014 presentation that each pound of lettuce created in an indoor farm would require about eight pounds of carbon dioxide. But the indoor agriculture industry isn\u2019t dissuaded. \u201cYou know, when they start colonizing Mars, they\u2019re going to need vertical farms to help feed the people there,\u201d Matros says. And as the New York Indoor Ag Con came to a close, founder Nicola Kerslake announced that next year\u2019s Las Vegas convention would be held in an aircraft hangar \u2013 attendance is expected to double.",

I joke that each farm is like a Lego block and you just need to drop it wherever you want to put a farm,\u201d Matros says. \u201cWe have these Lego boxes and we know how they work and we just have to put them together and drop them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eac97492bb2669e012424e9cc91073ae488fa19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eac97492bb2669e012424e9cc91073ae488fa19/0_267_5760_3454/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FarmedHere executives examine a crop of organic basil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">FarmedHere executives examine a crop of organic basil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FarmedHere</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In each region, Matros hopes the company can work with local farmers to incorporate their goods into FarmedHere\u2019s distribution. In Florida, for example, they could work with citrus farmers; in New York, with dairy farmers. </p> <p>While Matros plans to capitalize on the demand for local produce, the manufacturing feel of indoor farms contradicts the bucolic, idealized version of what consumers envision. There are no young families strolling through the windswept furrows under the bright sun. When Matros explains what it\u2019s like to walk through the facilities, he likens it to a Costco, but instead of pallets of Huggies or Cheerios, it\u2019s full of beds of plants bathed in purple-hued LED lights. </p> <p>\u201cWe build farms that are sort of like Disneylands of farming,\u201d he says. \u201cConsumers in each municipality can really feel like they\u2019re part of the community, and see where their food is being grown. It\u2019s similar to a farmers\u2019 market where you go and meet the farmer and see pictures of the operation.\u201d</p> <p>With the company\u2019s expansion will come new crops and products. At the moment, FarmedHere grows greens and herbs. \u201cNo pun intended, but it\u2019s low hanging fruit for indoor farming,\u201d Matros says. The next phase is to start making value-added products like salad dressings to get more mileage out of the crops. With this kind of progress, FarmedHere moves even further from being a traditional farm, entering the food manufacturer realm. </p> <p>While Matros hopes to one day grow more challenging crops, like avocados, the system still needs perfecting. While LED efficiency is increasing, the energy it takes to simulate sunlight and maintain proper temperatures is huge. </p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to find people who don\u2019t believe that indoor farming is a panacea. In a presentation this September, Bruce Bugbee from Utah State University\u2019s Department of Plants, Soils and Climate made the case that the fossil fuels needed to support the crops would add up to about $400,000 per acre. And even though lights are getting more efficient, the amount of solar panels needed would take up about five times the area as the cropland itself. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISAKc9gpGjw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ISAKc9gpGjw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Lou Albright, professor emeritus at Cornell University estimated in a February 2014 presentation that each pound of lettuce created in an indoor farm <a href=\"http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2014/02/indoor-urban-farms-called-wasteful-pie-sky\">would require about eight pounds of carbon dioxide</a>. </p> <p>But the indoor agriculture industry isn\u2019t dissuaded. \u201cYou know, when they start colonizing Mars, they\u2019re going to need vertical farms to help feed the people there,\u201d Matros says. </p> <p>And as the New York Indoor Ag Con came to a close, founder Nicola Kerslake announced that next year\u2019s Las Vegas convention would be held in an aircraft hangar \u2013 attendance is expected to double. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Blogger Katy Stevens considers herself a modern jack of all trades. In her world, it looks like this: \u201cI make money from a variety of websites, which I then write about on my blog.\u201d In November, she reported earning \u00a32,000 online (roughly US$3,030) from a variety of paying sources. Stevens uses mobile apps such as GeoTask, which reward users in cash and gift vouchers, in exchange for access to the GPS in their mobile phones. She also participates in affiliate marketing, putting links to Amazon products in her blog that, when clicked on by a reader, translate to a small fee. Earlier this year, Stevens discovered Spare5, an app that lets users complete small tasks on their mobile phones for cash. Stevens is one of a growing number of self-employed people who make up what\u2019s commonly called the \u201cgig economy\u201d. In the US alone, the self-employed and the workers they hired accounted for 44m jobs in 2014, or 30% of the national workforce, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data the US Census Bureau. Some analysts believe the number could be higher as people may not report the side jobs they pick up. Sharing economy platforms such as Lyft, Fiverr, Task Rabbit and others have capitalized on this new breed of worker willing to give rides, pick up someone else\u2019s dry cleaning or even draw a cartoon, sometimes for as little as a few dollars. But startups such as Seattle-based Spare5 are aiming to drill menial tasks down to even tinier increments that can be completed on a mobile device. The pay is commensurate with the size of the task: it\u2019s sometimes as low as a nickel. For example, users can match photos of similar items \u2013 something hard for a computer to do \u2013 for $0.15 a pop. Or they can call a business and verify its operating hours for $0.35 a piece. Gather enough of these together during downtime \u2013 such as a commute, waiting in line or even going to the bathroom \u2013 and instead of falling prey to a social feed, there\u2019s a cash reward. Payment is made through PayPal. Stevens says that because she\u2019s self-employed and has plenty of free time to complete such tasks, some weeks she\u2019s earned as much as $100; others, not a dime. \u201cI mostly look at any earnings from Spare5 as extra fun money, rather than relying on it for specific bills or anything else,\u201d she says. Which is how it\u2019s meant to be used, according to Spare5\u2019s CEO Matt Bencke. He insists that the startup, founded in 2014, isn\u2019t meant to be anyone\u2019s full-time job. \u201cSpare5 is the most extreme, modern manifestation of the future of work,\u201d he says. Bencke argues that Spare5 isn\u2019t part of the gig economy or its cousin, the on-demand economy. \u201cYou do it whenever you want,\u201d he says. Spending two minutes productively earning a bit of money on your mobile phone is considerably less challenging than giving strangers rides, he explains. \u201cYou download the app [on your iPhone], use your Facebook credentials and take a short survey, and in minutes you\u2019re off to the races.\u201d Building a bigger business on small tasks For companies such as Groupon, eBay and others that contract with Spare5, the value proposition is simple: it makes their products easier to find. Bencke points out that consumers buy products online based on images, yet search engines have difficulty categorizing pictures. When something as simple as a shoe can have as many as 120 characteristics, computers\u2019 artificial intelligence won\u2019t always be able to identify them all, which can hinder the discovery process that would lead to a purchase. Humans are much better at understanding things like the difference between laces on a shoe and lace edgings on a dress, Bencke explains, and therefore better equipped to tag photos with accuracy. \u201cThe best a computer can do is estimate how people in the past have reacted,\u201d he argues. This led to focusing Spare5\u2019s efforts on photos and videos to help e-commerce companies sift through and tag thousands of product shots without placing the burden on their existing employees. Bencke, a Microsoft veteran who also worked as a senior vice president at the stock photo and film distributor Getty Images, says when he was approached by a friend with the idea for Spare5, he said: \u201cWow, as a guy curating 110m images a day, I would love that service.\u201d Getty Images was among the first companies to use Spare5\u2019s \u201cfives\u201d, as those who execute the tasks through the app are called. They created titles and descriptions optimized for search engines for more than 200,000 photos, which Getty claims has resulted in increased traffic and and increased purchases for images that had optimized titles and descriptions. Another company using Spare5 also reports increases across the board. For Groupon, the online marketplace that offers deals at local businesses in 45 countries, it\u2019s imperative that the most up-to-date operating information is offered to consumers. It had been using employee hours in addition to crowdsourcing such facts through services like Crowdflower, but that wasn\u2019t delivering consistent results. Spare5\u2019s fivers performing more than 33,000 tasks were able to provide accurate information not available on the web, resulting in an increase in purchases and merchant loyalty. \u201cWe have tried several other crowd approaches, but Spare5\u2019s focus on a mobile community of experts has consistently delivered the best results,\u201d Dave Kunst, Groupon Pages director of product and business operations, said in a statement. Bencke says comparing Spare5 to Crowdflower or Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk (which now boasts over 250,000 \u201chuman intelligence tasks\u201d for the taking) always makes him cringe. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them competitors,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are just different.\u201d Targeting mobile first is one differentiator, he says, but there\u2019s something else. \u201cI really aspire to build a community,\u201d he contends. He says Spare5 has \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of active users. \u201cIt\u2019s better to have a medium sized business where everyone feels respected as an individual,\u201d Bencke says. \u201cThere\u2019s a place in the world for both.\u201d The dark side of no downtime There might be a problem, however, with selling off small snippets of spare time. While new research on mobile behavior from Nielsen found that people have almost doubled the amount of time they spend on smartphone apps since 2012, it\u2019s not clear that monetizing this behavior is a good thing. Bencke argues that Spare5 is \u201cthe ultimate manifestation of how we use our time productively\u201d. But workplace psychologist Karissa Thacker contends that busyness does not equal productivity. Social scientists found that productivity was enhanced when breaks are taken away from a computer or mobile device. The highest performers talked to colleagues, or took a walk. \u201cWhat is of increasing importance is the ability to manage oneself and one\u2019s time,\u201d Thacker says. If you are taking a break from complex work to dash off a few small tasks on Spare5, it could have the opposite effect. \u201cThe question is whether the busyness is making us more productive or just more tired.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Apple agrees to pay \u00a3234m to settle Italian tax dispute", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Apple has agreed to pay \u20ac318m (\u00a3234m) to settle a tax dispute with Italian authorities after the iPhone and iPad maker was investigated for suspected fraud. The US technology giant\u2019s Italian subsidiary and several of its senior executives had been under investigation for fraud over its alleged failure to comply with obligations to declare its earnings in Italy between 2008 and 2013. According to the Italian daily newspaper La Repubblica, Apple Italia should have paid corporation tax of \u20ac880m for the period. But, after months of negotiations, the tax authorities agreed to close the case in return for about a third of that amount. An Italy tax office spokesman confirmed the newspaper\u2019s report was accurate but would not divulge further details. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The settlement comes amid mounting controversy over the tax arrangements of multinational groups which stand accused of utilising complex cross-border corporate structures to reduce tax bills. Apple Italia is part of the company\u2019s European operation which is headquartered in Ireland, a country with one of the lowest levels of corporation tax in the European Union and where large portions of the group\u2019s worldwide profits have been booked. Ireland taxes corporate earnings from normal business activities at a rate of 12.5%, which compares with a standard rate of 27.5% in Italy. This month, the Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, described accusations that the world\u2019s richest company was sidestepping US taxes by stashing cash overseas as \u201cpolitical crap\u201d and insisted: \u201cWe pay every tax dollar we owe.\u201d The settlement of the tax dispute will not halt the criminal investigation into the conduct of three Apple Italia executives but will likely reduce the severity of any potential sanctions, La Repubblica said. The decision to sanction Apple Italia marks a broader push by Italian authorities to shake off the country\u2019s bad reputation for tax dodging. By the government\u2019s own estimates, annual losses to tax evasion exceed \u20ac90bn with almost half that down to sales taxes not being paid. Recent efforts by Matteo Renzi\u2019s government have sought to rein in the country\u2019s vast shadow economy and convince both individuals and companies to boost the state coffers. Earlier this month, the economy ministry hailed the success of a year-long voluntary disclosure scheme, which is expected to bring in at least \u20ac3.8bn. There were 130,000 declarations made under the amnesty, the ministry said, with the majority of hidden cash and assets held in Switzerland. Italians working across the Swiss border will also have to face a stricter tax regime, after the two countries reached an agreement last week on how to tackle the issue. Once approved by both governments, the deal is expected to see commuters continue to pay tax in Switzerland and deduct this from income tax in Italy. The murky finances of the Vatican have also been put under the spotlight this year, with the Holy See and Italy agreeing in April to share financial information. While the increased cooperation marks Italy\u2019s drive to catch tax evaders, it also reflects Pope Francis\u2019 bid to reform the Vatican administration which has been hit by waves of financial scandal and allegations of money laundering.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A glut of oil, the demise of Opec and weakening global demand combined to make 2015 the year of crashing oil prices. The cost of crude fell to levels not seen for 11 years \u2013 and the decline may have further to go. There have been four sharp increases in the price of oil in the past four decades \u2013 in 1973, 1979, 1990 and 2008 \u2013 and each has led to a global recession. By that measure, a lower oil price should be positive for the world economy, with lower fuel costs for consumers and businesses in those countries that import crude outweighing the losses to producing nations. But the evidence since oil prices started falling from their peak of $115 a barrel in August 2014 has not supported that thesis \u2013 or not yet. Oil producers have certainly felt the impact of the lower prices on their growth rates, their trade figures and their public finances butthere has been no surge in consumer spending or business investment elsewhere. Economist still reckon there will be a boost from a lower oil price particularly if it looks as if the lower cost of crude will be sustained. Dhaval Joshi, an economist at BCA, a London-based research company, said: \u201cA commodity bubble has deflated three times in the past 100 years: the first was after world war one; the second was after the 1980s oil shock; the third is happening right now.\u201d For the big producer countries, this is a major headache, the ramifications of which are only starting to be felt. Oil powers base their spending plans on an assumed crude price. The graphic below shows just how far below water their budgets are. Joshi says crude prices may fall by a further 35% to reach its long-term trend. That would mean an oil price closer to $25 a barrel - and fiscal crises in some of the world\u2019s most pivotal economies. Saudi Arabia Low oil prices are not just squeezing Saudi Arabia\u2019s domestic budget, imposing austerity on a kingdom not used to it: it is taking its toll on Saudi support for foreign projects too. The kingdom this week announced swingeing budget cuts for 2016 to address an alarming deficit of 15% of GDP run up this year. Subsidies for water, electricity and petroleum products are likely to be cut, and government projects reined in. But overseas beneficiaries will face some austerity too. For years, Saudi Arabia has used its oil wealth to support friends and allies around the world, including media organisations, thinktanks, academic institutions, religious schools and charities. Countries that have traditionally benefited from Saudi largesse include Jordan, Lebanon, Bahrain, Palestine and Egypt. But now the IMF has raised the prospect that Saudi Arabia could go bankrupt in five years without changes to its economic policy, cuts in support to foreign allies seem inevitable. Egypt\u2019s black-hole economy is potentially the kingdom\u2019s most expensive foreign policy commitment. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has donated billions in cash and oil products but, despite this, the Egyptian economy, battered by war, terrorism and political instability, is facing an acute foreign currency shortage. Speculation is mounting that Saudi financial support to Egypt is starting to dry up \u2013 something the Egyptian authorities have denied \u2013 and that this is damaging the bilateral relationship. There have been some signs of tension. In July, Egypt\u2019s oil minister said he had no objections to importing crude oil from Iran, a move sure to ruffle the Saudis. In September, the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi \u2013 known for his closeness to the Saudi state \u2013 raised eyebrows when he said the new Egyptian culture minister, Hilmi al-Namnam, who is well known for his secularism and dislike of Wahhabi Islam, should never have been appointed. So far, the Saudi authorities have given few clear signs about how they are planning to respond to the oil price crisis, let alone lay out a long-term plan for a post-oil Saudi Arabia. Options under consideration are thought to include cutting construction projects, energy subsidies and public sector wages, introducing new taxes and privatisations, and issuing debt. Another possibility foreign observers have posited is that the Saudis will be forced to unpeg the riyal from the dollar, although given the potential this would have for uncontrollable knock-on effects on the rest of the economy, this seems likely to be a last resort. Cuts impacting on ordinary Saudis are something the government will be keen to avoid to maintain political stability, so industry, the public sector and foreign allies are likely to bear the brunt of the economic burden. Nigeria The oil price slump has not prevented Nigeria\u2019s new government from unveiling big spending plans \u2013 but analysts warn that the generosity is misplaced at a time when oil prices languish below $40 a barrel. Nigeria is Africa\u2019s top oil producer and the World Bank estimates crude sales fund about 75% of the country\u2019s budget. In its \u00a319.8bn budget proposal, the government plans to increase spending by about one quarter over last year\u2019s budget, and to pay for it by improving tax collection and cutting the cost of government. The budget includes \u00a31.65bn for cash transfers to poor Nigerians. The programme was a campaign promise of the president, Muhammadu Buhari, who was elected in March on a platform of cutting corruption and weaning Nigeria\u2019s economy off its dependence on oil revenue. But some analysts think the proposed budget is unrealistic during times of $40 oil. \u201cThis brings a dose of reality to a people who have extremely high expectations,\u201d said Bismarck Rewane, the chief executive of Financial Derivatives Co. He predicted the government would have to back down on some of its promises. Nigeria is Africa\u2019s largest economy, but most of the money is concentrated in the hands of a wealthy elite and about two-thirds of Nigerians live in poverty, according to the United Nations development programme. Unemployment has climbed this year, hitting 9.9% in the third quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Chuba Ezekwesili, research analyst at Nigerian Economic Summit Group, says despite the falling price of crude, the country has been able to avoid a jump in inflation by imposing limits on the availability of foreign currency. While other major oil producing economies have let their currencies lose value along with oil prices, Nigeria has spent its reserves to prop up the value of the naira. But Ezekwesili says they can only do that for so long. \u201cThey\u2019re sort of delaying the inevitable,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like eventually it has to give way, and by the time it does I feel the economy is going to be hurt because a lot of businesses can\u2019t work under those conditions.\u201d Ezekwesili was also sceptical of the government\u2019s ability to generate the revenue necessary to pay for programmes such as cash transfers to the poor. He doubts the government can accomplish its goals of streamlining its costs and generating more revenue by next year. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned about policies in Nigeria is we tend to be very optimistic but it never really works out exactly as we want it to,\u201d Ezekwesili said. Russia Vladimir Putin goes into 2016 with record approval ratings but the shakiest economic outlook since he took charge. In the 15 years he has been at the helm, 2015 was the first year that real wages registered a decline, something that did not happen even during the 2008-09 financial crisis. Oil and gas exports make up about half of the Russian budget, and the rouble rate has been strongly linked to the price of oil. Sanctions against Russia, particularly the ban on Russian banks seeking western credit, combined with falling oil prices in late 2014 to create a perfect storm that demolished the rouble, with the currency losing half of its value against the dollar, reviving memories of previous crashes. The currency regained some of its value by spring, but falling oil prices in autumn have caused it to fall back to lows similar to those it experienced in late 2014. Falling oil prices were one of the principal reasons for the collapse in the Soviet economy, and some economists are warning of history repeating itself. Riding on a wave of high oil prices for most of his presidency, the Russian president did not expect such a sharp downturn. Last October, Putin said that if the price of oil fell below $80 a barrel, the world economy would crash. A range of other top Russian officials made similar statements, in effect ruling out the possibility that oil could fall below $70. Some analysts say the rouble is still overvalued, and the current oil price should theoretically push the rouble down further. This is necessary to balance the budget: the fewer dollars Russia receives for the oil it sells, the higher the exchange rate needs to be for the budget to receive the requisite amount of roubles. For the budget to balance at 65 roubles, not far off the current rate, the price of oil should be $70, a recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch report found. For ordinary Russians, it could be a tough year ahead. Those who were used to travelling abroad have already had to scale back as the rouble made the cost of visiting foreign cities prohibitive; and rising food prices have made it harder to balance the books for many families. The 2016 budget, fixed in October, requires oil to be at $50 in order to run a 3% deficit within \u201cacceptable\u201d rouble rate limits, meaning if the price does not rise soon, cuts will need to be made or reserves spent. The war in Syria is an extra cost, and the announced increases in military spending are not likely to be reversed. US Filling up at the gas station hasn\u2019t been this cheap in the US since the recession. The nationwide average price of a gallon of regular is now $2.02 (\u00a31.36), down 58 cents from this time last year, according to auto club AAA, and expected to fall further. Scared that North America\u2019s oil boom threatens its grip, Opec, the oil cartel, stepped up production and forced a price war that has driven oil prices down to below $35 a barrel. US consumers have benefited from lower petrol prices to the tune of about $700 a year, according to the US government, and that money is fuelling consumer spending. According to a recent report from JP Morgan, 80% of that saving is being spent on goods and services. But the collapsing price of oil has also cast a shadow over the US energy industry \u2013 formerly one of the country\u2019s fastest growing employers. Fracking \u2013 the controversial process of extracting oil and gas from shale rock \u2013 has become less attractive to investors as the oil price has fallen, and tens of thousands of jobs have been lost as a result. This year, the International Energy Agency said low oil prices would \u201cslam the brakes\u201d on the US shale industry and the impact is already being felt across the country\u2019s oil producing areas. The US energy sector has cut more than 90,000 jobs this year, according to outplacement company Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. And while the overall US unemployment rate has continued to fall, in Texas unemployment has risen since August, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics. In North Dakota, home of the Bakken shale oil field, more than 17% of the mining jobs \u2013 which include oil and natural gas \u2013 have disappeared in the past year. More jobs look certain to be lost in the coming months. North of the border in Canada, things are even worse. In Alberta, \u201cthe Texas of the north\u201d, job layoffs and the downturn of the economy have been blamed for a 30% rise in suicides between January and June, compared with 2014. In Saskatchewan, another energy-dependent region, there have been 19% more suicides this year. Daniel Pavilonis, senior commodity broker with RJO Futures, said the situation was only likely to get worse for those employed in the US energy sector. \u201cThere are oil tankers just sitting off the coast because we don\u2019t need more supply. We have too much,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s oversupply and a lack of anybody trying to tighten production because they don\u2019t want to lose market share.\u201d As a result he predicts oil prices will go lower, taking more jobs with it. But for most consumers, it\u2019s a win. Unlike other global economic trends, the oil price fall actually benefits average Americans, said Pavilonis. \u201cThis is our money,\u201d he said. \u201cFor most people, it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Venezuela In most of the world, falling oil prices have caused significant reductions in petrol prices. But in the country with the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, the oil glut could force a price rise. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the only place in the world where with oil prices so low, they may raise gasoline prices,\u201d says Pedro M\u00e9ndez, an informal taxi driver in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, who fills the tank of his Ford Laser for less than a dollar. But the lower the price of oil goes, the deeper Venezuela\u2019s economy sinks. It\u2019s near total dependence on crude exports for hard currency has seen the government of president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro struggling to try keep the economy afloat. The political effect is already being felt. Gripped by spiraling inflation, chronic shortages of basic goods and a quickly depreciating currency, Venezuelan voters this month gave the opposition an overwhelming majority in the new legislature, which takes office in January. Each $1 drop in oil prices results in more than $685m in lost yearly oil income for PDVSA, the state-owned oil company, according to analysts. And every drop in crude prices means less funding for the health, education and housing and other social welfare programmes that won Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, widespread support for his self-styled \u201cBolivarian revolution\u201d. While dwindling oil revenue hurts the social programmes, Antonio Azpurua, a financial consultant with CFS Partners/LA Group, says it could be a blessing in disguise, allowing Venezuela to wean itself of its dependence on crude. \u201cVenezuela needs to take advantage of low oil prices to build its industrial base,\u201d he says. With a super-majority in the National Assembly, the opposition could reverse some of Maduro\u2019s populist measures, which have contributed to the current economic crisis. They could also choose to raise petrol prices. Iran Iran is rushing to implement the landmark nuclear accord in order to cash in on sanctions relief as early as next month, but the plummeting price of oil is tempering its expectations even though its economy has become less dependent on crude sales. Tehran currently exports 1.1m barrels of oil per a but the Iranian oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, has announced that the country is aiming to double that amount within six months of sanctions being lifted, hoping it will return to the pre-sanctions level of 2.2m. Although the EU lifted Iranian sanctions in October after the Vienna nuclear agreement, the measures will only come into effect after what has become known as \u201cimplementation day\u201d, the unknown date when the UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, will verify that Iran has taken the necessary steps as outlined under the nuclear deal. Iran is expediting whatever it can to bring this date forward to as early as January. In an effort to woo foreign investment in the post-sanctions era, Iran put a set of new lucrative oil and gas contracts, worth more than $30bn, on the market this month. But all these efforts have come at a time when global oil prices are falling as a result of a crude surplus of 2m barrels a day, a phenomenon Tehran blames on the Saudis. \u201cThe drop in oil prices hurts all oil producers, not just Iran,\u201d said Amir Handjani, president of PG International commodities trading services and a member of the board directors of RAK Petroleum. \u201cSaudi Arabia is very aware that Iran will be able to sell its crude unencumbered by sanctions on the international market very soon and will use all means at its disposal to make sure Iran doesn\u2019t recapture the market share it lost over the past four years,\u201d he said. \u201cBasically, Riyadh\u2019s message to Tehran is simple: we can endure low oil prices for a while; can you?\u201d But the experience of years under sanctions has made the Iranian economy \u201cincredibly resilient\u201d, according to Handjani. Iran\u2019s economy faced huge economic problems in recent years due to international sanctions imposed over Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme. Plummeting oil prices only added to economic woes in a country with the world\u2019s fourth-largest oil reserves. \u201cTo be sure, low oil prices deny Tehran much needed revenue but unlike the Saudis, Iran\u2019s economy is not solely dependent on oil exports. Oil revenue accounts for about 15% of Iran\u2019s GDP,\u201d Handjani told the Guardian. Sanctions have forced Iran to diversify its economy, he said. It has a large manufacturing base, IT sector, and robust agro-industries, which make its economy on the whole \u201cmuch more balanced\u201d than Saudi Arabia. \u201cThe Iranian economy has absorbed so many shocks over the past 36 years, from war to sanctions, that the pain of low oil prices now, as it breaks from international isolation, pales in comparison.\u201d Without naming Saudi Arabia, Zanganeh said last week that it was clear which country had an excess of supply and that there was \u201cno ambiguity about who they are\u201d. On the occasion of unveiling new oil contracts, the Iranian minister said last month that his country was willing to play a major role in oil supply and was even ready to work with American companies. \u201cThe way for the presence of these companies in Iran\u2019s oil industry is open,\u201d he said at the Iran Petroleum Contracts Conference in Tehran. The deputy managing director of the national Iranian oil company (NIOC) told the Guardian in September that the Iranian government was earning more from tax than oil for the first time in almost half a century as the country shifts its traditional reliance on crude to taxation revenues in the face of falling oil prices. Critics say Iran is unlikely to maintain that equation when the lifting of sanctions allows it to export more oil. According to Opec, Iran on average was selling oil at $38.92 a barrel in November, $5.63 less than the average in October, which is the worst drop among the group\u2019s members. Libya Plunging oil prices are threatening disaster in Libya, where civil war has left the population depending on fast-dwindling oil revenues to survive. Libya has Africa\u2019s largest oil reserves and in normal times this provides 95% of the country\u2019s export revenues, keeping the economy afloat. But civil war between rival governments at either end of the country has shattered the economy, leaving the population almost wholly dependent on revenue generated overseas. The crash in oil prices has halved revenues, and shortages of foodstuffs and medicines \u2013 even petrol \u2013 are starting to be felt. This cash squeeze has triggered a three-way battle for control of what remains of the country\u2019s oil wealth. Much of Libya\u2019s largest group of oil fields, the Sirte Basin, is now held by Islamic State, which has interposed itself between forces of the rival governments. Most of what remains is in eastern Libya, held by the elected parliament based in Tobruk. Tobruk is using its status as the internationally recognised government to battle in foreign courts for the right to income from other producing fields, opposing the state-owned National Oil Corporation, whose headquarters remains in Tripoli, held by a rival parliament. Tobruk has set up a second National Oil Corporation, based in eastern Libya, and last month demanded international oil companies switch payments that currently go to Tripoli. Countering that, Tripoli\u2019s NOC chief, Mustafa Sanallah, convened a conference in London in October calling on oil buyers to stick with him. Two of the world\u2019s largest oil buyers, Glencore and Vitol, have agreed, but the eastern government has vowed legal action. London courts are likely to be the proving ground for this test of wills, with both governments already gearing up for a precedent-setting high court battle, due early next year, for control of the Libya Investment Authority, the country\u2019s \u00a365bn sovereign wealth fund. But whoever wins control of what remains of the oil industry may find it a pyrrhic victory. John Hamilton, director of London\u2019s Cross-border Information, says the glut of oil on world markets and turbulence around the few remaining oil ports means Libyan oil has already been \u201cpriced out\u201d by many buyers.",

By that measure, a lower oil price should be positive for the world economy, with lower fuel costs for consumers and businesses in those countries that import crude outweighing the losses to producing nations.</p> <p>But the evidence <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/03/oil-collapse-leads-world-economy-trouble\">since oil prices started falling from their peak</a> of $115 a barrel in August 2014 has not supported that thesis \u2013 or not yet. Oil producers have certainly felt the impact of the lower prices on their growth rates, their trade figures and their public finances butthere has been no surge in consumer spending or business investment elsewhere.</p> <p>Economist still reckon there will be a boost from a lower oil price particularly if it looks as if the lower cost of crude will be sustained. </p> <p>Dhaval Joshi, an economist at BCA, a London-based research company, said: \u201cA commodity bubble has deflated three times in the past 100 years: the first was after world war one; the second was after the 1980s oil shock; the third is happening right now.\u201d</p> <p>For the big producer countries, this is a major headache, the ramifications of which are only starting to be felt.

Riding on a wave of high oil prices for most of his presidency, the Russian president did not expect such a sharp downturn. Last October, Putin said that if the price of oil fell below $80 a barrel, the world economy would crash. A range of other top Russian officials made similar statements, in effect ruling out the possibility that oil could fall below $70.</p> <p>Some analysts say the rouble is still overvalued, and the current oil price should theoretically push the rouble down further. This is necessary to balance the budget: the fewer dollars Russia receives for the oil it sells, the higher the exchange rate needs to be for the budget to receive the requisite amount of roubles. For the budget to balance at 65 roubles, not far off the current rate, the price of oil should be $70, a recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch report found. </p> <p>For ordinary Russians, it could be a tough year ahead. Those who were used to travelling abroad have already had to scale back as the rouble made the cost of visiting foreign cities prohibitive; and rising food prices have made it harder to balance the books for many families.</p> <p>The 2016 budget, fixed in October, requires oil to be at $50 in order to run a 3% deficit within \u201cacceptable\u201d rouble rate limits, meaning if the price does not rise soon, cuts will need to be made or reserves spent. The war in Syria is an extra cost, and the announced increases in military spending are not likely to be reversed.</p> <h2>US</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85ebc71509c0fe10941a98ca41dd651c32cbb283\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85ebc71509c0fe10941a98ca41dd651c32cbb283/0_0_5760_3458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Belridge, California, one of the oldest and largest oilfields in the US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Belridge, California, is one of the oldest and largest oilfields in the US containing tens of thousands of wells, many of which are being fracked.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Les Stone/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Filling up at the gas station hasn\u2019t been this cheap in the US since the recession. The nationwide average price of a gallon of regular is now $2.02 (\u00a31.36), down 58 cents from this time last year, according to auto club AAA, and expected to fall further.</p> <p>Scared that North America\u2019s oil boom threatens its grip, Opec, the oil cartel, stepped up production and forced a price war that has driven oil prices down to below $35 a barrel. US consumers have benefited from lower petrol prices to the tune of about $700 a year, according to the US government, and that money is fuelling consumer spending. According to a recent report from JP Morgan, 80% of that saving is being spent on goods and services.</p> <p>But the collapsing price of oil has also cast a shadow over the US energy industry \u2013 formerly one of the country\u2019s fastest growing employers. Fracking \u2013 the controversial process of extracting oil and gas from shale rock \u2013 has become less attractive to investors as the oil price has fallen, and tens of thousands of jobs have been lost as a result. This year, the International Energy Agency said low oil prices would \u201cslam the brakes\u201d on the US shale industry and the impact is already being felt across the country\u2019s oil producing areas. </p> <p>The US energy sector has cut more than 90,000 jobs this year, according to outplacement company Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. And while the overall US unemployment rate has continued to fall, in Texas unemployment has risen since August, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics. In North Dakota, home of the Bakken shale oil field, more than 17% of the mining jobs \u2013 which include oil and natural gas \u2013 have disappeared in the past year. More jobs look certain to be lost in the coming months.</p> <p>North of the border in Canada, things are even worse. In Alberta, \u201cthe Texas of the north\u201d, job layoffs and the downturn of the economy have been blamed for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/14/canada-oil-production-crisis-suicide-alberta\">30% rise in suicides</a> between January and June, compared with 2014. In Saskatchewan, another energy-dependent region, there have been <a href=\"http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/provincial/health/suicide.aspx\">19% more</a> suicides this year.</p> <p>Daniel Pavilonis, senior commodity broker with RJO Futures, said the situation was only likely to get worse for those employed in the US energy sector. \u201cThere are oil tankers just sitting off the coast because we don\u2019t need more supply. We have too much,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s oversupply and a lack of anybody trying to tighten production because they don\u2019t want to lose market share.\u201d</p> <p>As a result he predicts oil prices will go lower, taking more jobs with it. But for most consumers, it\u2019s a win. Unlike other global economic trends, the oil price fall actually benefits average Americans, said Pavilonis. \u201cThis is our money,\u201d he said. \u201cFor most people, it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p> <h2>Venezuela</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"842a910022b5b765ec03225c2ea9bfdd4f6d9210\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/842a910022b5b765ec03225c2ea9bfdd4f6d9210/0_8_4568_2742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mural depicts President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural depicts President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who, having lost the Venezuelan National Assembly, has a battle to keep economy and his leadership afloat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In most of the world, falling oil prices have caused significant reductions in petrol prices. But in the country with the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, the oil glut could force a price rise. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably the only place in the world where with oil prices so low, they may raise gasoline prices,\u201d says Pedro M\u00e9ndez, an informal taxi driver in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, who fills the tank of his Ford Laser for less than a dollar. </p> <p>But the lower the price of oil goes, the deeper Venezuela\u2019s economy sinks. It\u2019s near total dependence on crude exports for hard currency has seen the government of president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro struggling to try keep the economy afloat. </p> <p>The political effect is already being felt. Gripped by spiraling inflation, chronic shortages of basic goods and a quickly depreciating currency, Venezuelan voters this month gave the opposition an overwhelming majority in the new legislature, which takes office in January.</p> <p>Each $1 drop in oil prices results in more than $685m in lost yearly oil income for PDVSA, the state-owned oil company, according to analysts. </p> <p>And every drop in crude prices means less funding for the health, education and housing and other social welfare programmes that won Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, widespread support for his self-styled \u201cBolivarian revolution\u201d.</p> <p> While dwindling oil revenue hurts the social programmes, Antonio Azpurua, a financial consultant with CFS Partners/LA Group, says it could be a blessing in disguise, allowing Venezuela to wean itself of its dependence on crude. \u201cVenezuela needs to take advantage of low oil prices to build its industrial base,\u201d he says. </p> <p>With a super-majority in the National Assembly, the opposition could reverse some of Maduro\u2019s populist measures, which have contributed to the current economic crisis.

Iran is expediting whatever it can to bring this date forward to as early as January.</p> <p>In an effort to woo foreign investment in the post-sanctions era, Iran put a set of new lucrative oil and gas contracts, worth more than $30bn, on the market this month. But all these efforts have come at a time when global oil prices are falling as a result of a crude surplus of 2m barrels a day, a phenomenon Tehran blames on the Saudis. </p> <p>\u201cThe drop in oil prices hurts all oil producers, not just Iran,\u201d said Amir Handjani, president of PG International commodities trading services and a member of the board directors of RAK Petroleum.</p> <p>\u201cSaudi Arabia is very aware that Iran will be able to sell its crude unencumbered by sanctions on the international market very soon and will use all means at its disposal to make sure Iran doesn\u2019t recapture the market share it lost over the past four years,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cBasically, Riyadh\u2019s message to Tehran is simple: we can endure low oil prices for a while; can you?\u201d</p> <p>But the experience of years under sanctions has made the Iranian economy \u201cincredibly resilient\u201d, according to Handjani. Iran\u2019s economy faced huge economic problems in recent years due to international sanctions imposed over Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme. Plummeting oil prices only added to economic woes in a country with the world\u2019s fourth-largest oil reserves.</p> <p>\u201cTo be sure, low oil prices deny Tehran much needed revenue but unlike the Saudis, Iran\u2019s economy is not solely dependent on oil exports. Oil revenue accounts for about 15% of Iran\u2019s GDP,\u201d Handjani told the Guardian. Sanctions have forced Iran to diversify its economy, he said. It has a large manufacturing base, IT sector, and robust agro-industries, which make its economy on the whole \u201cmuch more balanced\u201d than Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>\u201cThe Iranian economy has absorbed so many shocks over the past 36 years, from war to sanctions, that the pain of low oil prices now, as it breaks from international isolation, pales in comparison.\u201d </p> <p>Without naming Saudi Arabia, Zanganeh said last week that it was clear which country had an excess of supply and that there was \u201cno ambiguity about who they are\u201d. On the occasion of unveiling new oil contracts, the Iranian minister said last month that his country was willing to play a major role in oil supply and was even ready to work with American companies. \u201cThe way for the presence of these companies in Iran\u2019s oil industry is open,\u201d <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/iran-unveils-upgraded-model-oil-contracts-114904869--finance.html\">he said at the Iran Petroleum Contracts Conference</a> in Tehran. </p> <p>The deputy managing director of the national Iranian oil company (NIOC) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/27/iran-tax-oil-first-time-50-years\">told the Guardian in September</a> that the Iranian government was earning more from tax than oil for the first time in almost half a century as the country shifts its traditional reliance on crude to taxation revenues in the face of falling oil prices. Critics say Iran is unlikely to maintain that equation when the lifting of sanctions allows it to export more oil. </p> <p>According to Opec, Iran on average was selling oil at $38.92 a barrel in November, $5.63 less than the average in October, which is the worst drop among the group\u2019s members. </p> <h2>Libya</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"079a709f32c8f8ae1d8126f910ef3ca84700dba5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/079a709f32c8f8ae1d8126f910ef3ca84700dba5/174_0_3922_2355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fuel depots on fire in Libya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fuel depots and tankers have been targets for years in the struggle for control of Libya and its oil resources.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plunging oil prices are threatening disaster in Libya, where civil war has left the population depending on fast-dwindling oil revenues to survive.</p> <p>Libya has Africa\u2019s largest oil reserves and in normal times this provides 95% of the country\u2019s export revenues, keeping the economy afloat. But civil war between rival governments at either end of the country has shattered the economy, leaving the population almost wholly dependent on revenue generated overseas.</p> <p>The crash in oil prices has halved revenues, and shortages of foodstuffs and medicines \u2013 even petrol \u2013 are starting to be felt.</p> <p>This cash squeeze has triggered a three-way battle for control of what remains of the country\u2019s oil wealth. Much of Libya\u2019s largest group of oil fields, the Sirte Basin, is now held by Islamic State, which has interposed itself between forces of the rival governments. Most of what remains is in eastern Libya, held by the elected parliament based in Tobruk. </p> <p>Tobruk is using its status as the internationally recognised government to battle in foreign courts for the right to income from other producing fields, opposing the state-owned National Oil Corporation, whose headquarters remains in Tripoli, held by a rival parliament.</p> <p>Tobruk has set up a second National Oil Corporation, based in eastern Libya, and last month demanded international oil companies switch payments that currently go to Tripoli.</p> <p>Countering that, Tripoli\u2019s NOC chief, Mustafa Sanallah, convened a conference in London in October calling on oil buyers to stick with him. Two of the world\u2019s largest oil buyers, Glencore and Vitol, have agreed, but the eastern government has vowed legal action.</p> <p>London courts are likely to be the proving ground for this test of wills, with both governments already gearing up for a precedent-setting high court battle, due early next year, for control of the Libya Investment Authority, the country\u2019s \u00a365bn sovereign wealth fund. </p> <p>But whoever wins control of what remains of the oil industry may find it a pyrrhic victory. John Hamilton, director of London\u2019s Cross-border Information, says the glut of oil on world markets and turbulence around the few remaining oil ports means Libyan oil has already been \u201cpriced out\u201d by many buyers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Average pay growth for Britain\u2019s workers is likely to stall at about 2% in 2016, as the ready availability of migrants makes it easy for employers to fill vacancies, according to a forecast of the labour market. In its annual assessment, the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development (CIPD), which represents the human resources profession, says job creation will remain strong over the next 12 months, but wage growth has reached a plateau. Its assessment of UK earning prospects are less bullish than those of the Bank of England and the government\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. Both expect average pay to expand by about 3.5% in 2016, helping to rebuild living standards dented by the long post-recession pay squeeze. But the CIPD says that while up to 400,000 jobs are likely to be created the next year, there is little evidence of a skills shortage, making it difficult for workers to demand generous pay rises. Mark Beatson, the institute\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cOur research shows that most employers remain confident about recruitment going into 2016 and most say they have a choice of suitable candidates for most positions. \u201cWith record levels of net migration into the UK increasing the supply of labour, it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019re going to see a skills crunch any time soon. Our research shows pay expectations for the year ahead centred on a 2% increase.\u201d With inflation close to zero, and expected to bounce back only gradually in the new year, that would still deliver a rise in living standards for workers. But with average weekly earnings still 9% below 2008 levels in real terms, the CIPD\u2019s forecasts suggest it is likely to be some time before real incomes recover to pre-crisis levels. Danny Blanchflower, a labour market expert and former member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), said: \u201cI think the CIPD\u2019s right. The labour market is slowing, and what we have got is pressure pushing down on wages: from the unemployed, from the underemployed, [and] by the potential flow of migrants from central and eastern Europe.\u201d Official figures show the number of non-UK nationals in the workforce has surged from 986,000 in 1997 to 3.22 million \u2013 a rise from 3.7% of the workforce to more than 10%. Almost three-quarters of the employment growth in the past year was accounted for by non-UK citizens, according to official figures. The number of non-UK nationals working in the UK increased by 326,000, compared with a 122,000 increase in the number of UK workers. Expectations of modest pay growth in 2016 come despite the imminent introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, which will see the national minimum wage for the over-25s increase by 50p an hour, to \u00a37.20, in April. Beatson said that together with the apprenticeship levy, which larger employers will have to pay from 2017, and pension auto-enrolment, the national living wage would push up costs for employers. \u201cWith inflation close to zero, some employers will try to manage these costs by restricting pay rises for their better-paid employees,\u201d he added. Weaker-than-expected wage growth has been one reason for the MPC\u2019s decision to leave interest rates on hold at their record low of 0.5% throughout 2015. Mark Carney, the Bank of England\u2019s governor, predicted in July that the decision about raising rates could come into \u201csharper focus\u201d, \u201caround the turn of the year\u201d; but the final MPC meeting of the year passed with just one of its nine members voting for an immediate increase. The latest official data showed wage growth slowing to an annual rate of 2%, in the three months to October. Wage growth has repeatedly been weaker than forecasters have expected over recent years, despite the rapid rate of jobs growth, which would usually be expected to lead to upward pressures on pay. Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, has suggested structural factors, including technological advances that have left a growing number of workers vulnerable to being replaced by machines, could continue to undermine wage growth. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 January 2016. An earlier version said that almost three-quarters of new jobs created in the past year went to non-UK nationals, according to official figures \u2013 326,000 compared with 122,000 jobs taken by UK workers. The ONS estimates relate to people in employment, not to the number of jobs.",
