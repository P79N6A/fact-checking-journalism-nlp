      "bodyText": "The advertising watchdog has censured Pret a Manger for claiming that its sandwiches use natural ingredients, in a blow to the chain\u2019s wholesome credentials. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the ads on Pret\u2019s Facebook page and website, which included the promise that it made \u201cproper sandwiches avoiding the obscure chemicals, additives and preservatives\u201d used by other fast-food chains and talked about \u201cgood, natural food\u201d were misleading. The watchdog said consumers understood \u201cnatural\u201d to mean foods made with ingredients straight from nature. \u201cIt is misleading to use the term to describe foods or ingredients that employ chemicals,\u201d it said in its ruling. \u201cWe considered that because some of Pret a Manger\u2019s foods contained E-numbers \u2026 those foods did not constitute \u2018natural\u2019 foods for the purposes of the [food labelling] guidance.\u201d The decision followed a complaint by the Real Bread Campaign, which is calling for an \u201chonest crust act\u201d that would force manufacturers to list all their ingredients. Some are left out on the basis they are just part of the processing. Pret says its sandwich bread contains three E-numbers: E472e (diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides) to strengthen the dough and leave fewer large holes in the bread, E471 (mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids) to soften the crumb and E300 (ascorbic acid or vitamin C) to help the dough rise. The additives are widely used in the industry to make sandwich bread, it said. \u201cWe would really like to find a solution, and our food team has been working hard trialling recipes that do not use emulsifiers,\u201d a Pret spokeswoman said. \u201cThey have not yet found one that meets the standards our customers expect.\u201d The Real Bread Campaign\u2019s coordinator, Chris Young, said: \u201cWe welcome this ban, which sets a precedent that sends a clear message to food companies that unless they walk the natural food walk, it\u2019s misleading to talk the natural food talk. This ruling is good for shoppers ... and for the small, independent bakery and eatery owner who serve genuinely all-natural real bread sandwiches.\u201d Pret was founded in 1986 by the entrepreneur Julian Metcalfe, who went on to create the Itsu restaurant chain and Metcalfe\u2019s skinny popcorn. It is now an ubiquitous presence on the British high street, a favourite of office workers who appreciate its ability to spot the latest food trends, from the rise of the avocado to vegan-friendly options such as sweet potato falafel. The company has become a global sandwich empire, with more than 500 stores and sales approaching \u00a3800m in 2017 as it conquered new markets including the US. It is controlled by the private equity firm Bridgepoint and there has been speculation it is preparing for a stock market flotation in New York that could value it at more than \u00a31.5bn. Pret\u2019s food and coffee director, Clare Clough, said: \u201cSince day one, Pret has been on a mission to create handmade, natural food, avoiding obscure chemicals and preservatives. The ASA has upheld in part a complaint about our use of the word natural in two instances online. \u201cWe do, of course, take on board the views of the ASA and have already made the requested changes. We believe we represent Pret\u2019s food honestly and we always welcome feedback.\u201d The ASA said the two ads should not appear again in their current form. \u201cWe told Pret a Manger to ensure their ads did not claim or imply that their food was \u201cnatural\u201d, unless their products and ingredients were in line with consumer expectations of the term,\u201d it said. Rising levels of obesity and concerns about food provenance and the environment have led to growing scrutiny of how food manufacturers and retailers run their businesses. Recent research by global nutrition experts found that people in Britain buy more ultra-processed food than any other European country. The Real Bread Campaign first approached Pret in 2015, urging the company to remove artificial additives or alter its marketing claims. After no progress was made the campaign, which is part of the charity Sustain: the alliance for better food and farming, complained to the ASA at the end of 2016.",

    "webTitle": "Starbucks to close 8,000 US stores for racial-bias training", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Starbucks has moved to try to resolve the uproar over the arrest of two black men at one of its stores, announcing plans to close more than 8,000 US stores for several hours next month to conduct racial-bias training for its nearly 175,000 workers. The announcement came after the arrests last week in Philadelphia sparked protests and calls for a boycott. The two men were arrested for \u201ctrespassing\u201d while they were waiting for a friend in the store. Starbucks said the stores and corporate offices will be closed on the afternoon of 29 May while it gives training to staff. Starbucks\u2019 chief executive, Kevin Johnson, condemned the arrests, calling them \u201creprehensible\u201d, and said he wanted to apologize to the men face-to-face. Starbucks has come under fire before. In 2015, the then CEO, Howard Schultz, launched a campaign in which baristas stuck labels that read \u201cRace Together\u201d on coffee cups to try to spark a dialogue about race. The campaign caught fire on social media and was condemned for being superficial and ill-conceived. Schultz confessed he was surprised at the level of \u201cvisceral hate and contempt for the company, and for me personally\u201d it provoked. Starbucks has continued to champion progressive causes in the workplace. Last month, it claimed it had achieved 100% pay equity across gender and race for all its US employees, and committed to doing the same for its overseas operations, an initiative publicly backed by equality activist and tennis legend Billie Jean King. Communications experts said such policies meant Starbucks had to hold itself to high standards in all its stores. Jacinta Gauda, the head of the Gauda Group, a New York strategic communications firm, said: \u201cThe more your brand is trying to connect emotionally to people, the more hurt people feel when these kinds of things happen. They are breaking a promise. That\u2019s what makes it hurt deeper.\u201d John Gordon, a restaurant industry analyst with Pacific Management Consulting Group, said Starbucks has a reputation for well-managed stores, \u201ca point of difference that allows them to sell primarily drinks and coffees that have a higher cost\u201d. But in a multinational company with more than 28,000 stores worldwide, Gordon said: \u201c[There has] to be a situation every day where some human being handles things wrong. You can\u2019t have that many employees and not have something stupid happen. Even with a huge operations manual that lays out what to say and what to do, you can\u2019t cover everything.\u201d Starbucks also touts the diversity of its workforce. It says minority Americans comprise more than 40% of the company\u2019s US employees. Those efforts are in stark contrast to the video that went viral over the weekend, which showed the two black men being arrested by police who were called by an employee. Officials said police officers were told the men had asked to use the store\u2019s restroom but were denied because they hadn\u2019t bought anything and they refused to leave. A Starbucks spokeswoman said on Tuesday that the employee no longer works at the store, but declined to give further details. Gauda warned Starbucks against treating Philadelphia as a one-off affair, and urged the company to investigate whether there were any warning signs. \u201cI would suspect that this particular issue is something that has occurred before,\u201d Gauda said. \u201cThe company is in crisis mode now, but they should not look at this as an isolated issue.\u201d Associated Press contributed to this article",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Some of the UK\u2019s biggest stock market-listed companies including the oil giant BP, the housebuilder Persimmon and the travel firm Tui have been criticised for their lack of women in leadership roles and could face investor revolts in the coming months. The Investment Association, which represents fund managers who collectively own a third of all FTSE-traded shares, warned that investors were \u201cbecoming restless\u201d, as the AGM season got under way. One of the biggest investors in the UK stock market, Legal &amp; General Investment Management, on Tuesday announced it would step up pressure on companies by voting against the chairs of FTSE 350 firms at annual meetings this year if their boards were not at least 25% female. The Investment Association, whose 240 members manage \u00a36.9tn of assets, has written to 14 FTSE 100 companies, 35 FTSE 350 businesses and 21 firms in the FTSE 250 asking them to explain their poor gender balance and to call for change. They include companies in the FTSE 100 with all-male executive committees, such as BP and the packaging company Smurfit Kappa Group, and firms whose senior management have low proportions of women, such as Persimmon and Tui. Other listed companies with all-male management teams include the doorstep lender Provident Financial, the wealth management firm St James\u2019s Place, the retailer Sports Direct and the infrastructure firm Stobart Group. Two years ago, the Hampton-Alexander review, an independent government-commissioned report, said smaller FTSE 350 companies should aim to fill at least a third of their boardroom positions with women by 2020. Large and medium-sized companies, listed on the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250 respectively, should have at least a third of their executive committees and executive pipeline positions filled by women by 2020. The review was led by Sir Philip Hampton, the chairman of GlaxoSmithKline, and the late Dame Helen Alexander, former chair of UBM. The targets are voluntary. Chris Cummings, chief executive of the Investment Association, said research had suggested that firms with a diverse management team made better decisions and outperformed less diverse businesses. \u201cA number of key investors have told us that they will vote against AGM resolutions on the grounds of gender representation,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the AGM season now in full swing, companies who are falling short should take urgent steps to outline what they plan to do to increase diversity.\u201d Ten FTSE 250 firms did not provide gender diversity data last year, including the AA, the turnaround specialist Melrose, which has just acquired GKN after a hostile takeover battle, JD Wetherspoon, WH Smith and Wizz Air. Hampton said: \u201cWhilst the majority of FTSE companies are taking great strides to address the lack of women on boards and in their leadership teams, it is disappointing to see a significant minority of companies still making slow or no progress.\u201d Hampton will next month write to all FTSE 350 companies urging them to submit their gender data as of 30 June. The full report will be published later in the year and will show the representation of women across 23,000 senior leadership roles. The new initiative comes as MPs investigate how government can help promote women to better-paid and more senior roles within business using the new gender pay gap reporting requirements. Earlier this month, more than 10,000 companies reported their gender pay gap. The data, which measures the difference in average hourly earnings between all men and all women working for an organisation regardless of their roles, rather than men and women in the same role, showed that, on average, women were being paid a median hourly rate 9.7% less than men. Sam Smethers, chief executive of the campaigning group the Fawcett Society, told MPs on Tuesday that the government should require all companies with more than 50 employees to report on their pay gap, drawing in far more organisations than the current 250 employee bar. Smethers, Brenda Trenowden, from the 30% Club campaigning group, and Alice Hood, from the Trades Union Congress, also called for the introduction of mandatory pay gap action plans in order to foster change.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "WPP has hired a New York-based recruitment firm as it begins the global search to replace founder and chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. Russell Reynolds, a top five global executive search firm, is understood to be working with Frances Illingworth, WPP\u2019s global head of recruitment. The move to bring in an external executive search firm is extremely rare for WPP, which traditionally handles most of its executive recruitment in-house. Sorrell\u2019s departure from WPP has prompted the leading ratings agency Moody\u2019s to downgrade its outlook for the group, citing concerns including a breakup, the loss of clients and its poor performance compared with rivals. The downgrade, from \u201cstable\u201d to \u201cnegative\u201d, comes as WPP\u2019s 11-strong board was set to meet on Tuesday with the task of finding Sorrell\u2019s successor high on the agenda. \u201cIn Moody\u2019s view, the high-profile departure of Sir Martin Sorrell raises concerns over the future strategy and shape of the group, increases client-retention risk and could hence hinder WPP\u2019s ability to meet its 2018 guidance,\u201d said Christian Azz, Moody\u2019s assistant vice-president. WPP issued a number of warnings about growth last year on its way to reporting its worst financial year since the 2009 recession. It has also seen its market value slashed by a third. It lost almost 7% on Monday alone as jittery investors worried about its future without its founder as ad clients cut back their budgets and reconsider their spending strategies. \u201cSir Martin Sorrell\u2019s resignation comes at a time when the company is already facing a number of operational challenges and introduces uncertainty over the strategy and ultimately the structure of the group going forward,\u201d said Azzi. Moody\u2019s said that WPP was already weakly positioned before Sorrell\u2019s departure, performing significantly below its peers such as the US groups Omincom and IPG and the French firm Publicis. WPP\u2019s board meeting, the first not to include its founder and chief executive in years, was expected to include Mark Read and Andrew Scott, the senior executives promoted to run the company day-to-day during the search for a new chief executive. They are also considered the two leading internal candidates. The board member Sol Trujillo, a former chief of companies including the French telecoms firm Orange and Australia\u2019s Telstra, is understood to have been one of the most vocal about the issue of succession at WPP. A number of names have emerged as potential runners and riders to succeed Sorrell, including the chief executive of the publishing and exhibitions group Informa, Stephen Carter, who has worked at Ofcom, the cable firm NTL and WPP\u2019s ad agency JWT; Adam Crozier, whose pedigree includes running ITV, the Royal Mail, the Football Association and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi; the Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, and Andrew Robertson, the chief executive of Omnicom\u2019s global BBDO ad network. Sorrell has said he was available to assist with the transition. The 73-year old has \u201cunreservedly denied\u201d misconduct allegations and WPP\u2019s board has said it would not be publishing the outcome of the investigations into them by an independent law firm. The influential shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis said it would prefer WPP to publish the report but that it accepted this was unlikely to happen. \u201cIn the interests of transparency, we would prefer if the report was made available to shareholders, though we view that outcome as unlikely,\u201d said Martin Mortell, Glass Lewis UK &amp; Europe\u2019s director of research. \u201cSome investors may be willing to forego transparency in lieu of achieving overdue change at the top and the opportunity of a new strategic vision.\u201d Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, has said there was a \u201creal lack of transparency\u201d and \u201cany investigations done by the company should be made public\u201d. The company said it had concluded the investigation and had no further comment to make. WPP\u2019s share price moved up almost 2% in trading on Tuesday as market sentiment about the prospects of the advertising giant steadied.",

Wages rose by 2.8% per year in the three months to February, meaning they narrowly overtook inflation. In a solid set of data, the UK unemployment rate hit a new 42-year low of 4.2% and the employment rate climbed to a record high. But.... workers are still around \u00a3800 per year poorer than before the financial crisis, and real wage growth is likely to remain modest this year. Economists have also predicted that rising wages make a UK interest rate rise next month more likely. This helped to push the pound up to a new 22-month high this morning. Although it has dipped since, it is close to its highest point since June 2016 (before the EU referendum). The International Monetary Fund has sounded the alarm over rising protectionism in the global economy. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF also predicted that global growth will be solid this year and next, but it also sees a slowdown further ahead. World stock markets have gained ground today, thanks to strong financial results from Netflix and Goldman Sachs - and the absence of fresh geopolitical tensions. That\u2019s probably all for today... The IMF\u2019s warning about trade wars hasn\u2019t spooked the financial markets. Over in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average has gained 209 points, or 0.85%, to 24,782. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indices are also enjoying gains, as investors shrug off the Fund\u2019s worries about looming problems in the global economy. Instead, Wall Street has been cheered by forecast-beating results from Netflix last night, and both Goldman Sachs and Johnson &amp; Johnson today. Why do the IMF\u2019s long-term forecasts suggest Britain might outperform some EU members, despite Brexit? Maurice Obsfeld says the Fund is using a rather optimistic model for Brexit, in which no new tariffs are imposed between the UK and the European Union and there is broad equivalency between the two sides. This best-case scenario assumes that both sides aim for an agreement n their own interests. So, \u201cif all goes well...things do not look so bad\u201d for the UK economy, Obsfeld said. But, there will still be losses compared to staying in the EU, he adds. Chris Giles of the FT points out that the IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook is rather more positive than Maurice Obstfeld\u2019s gloomy statement today. Is that because recent economic data, and spiralling trade tensions, mean the report is already out of date? Obstfeld agrees that some \u201chigh frequency data\u201d that suggests slowing economic growth has been released in recent weeks, since the report was completed. That includes various Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) reports, which have fallen back from recent highs. The IMF is taking questions on its World Economic Outlook now. Our economics editor Larry Elliott asks the Fund what it wants creditor nations (such as Germany and China) to do to help tackle trade imbalances. Maurice Obstfeld replies that Germany has the ability to spend more on infrastructure, and also boost private investment - measures that would close its trade surplus. On the other side of the coin, America should be more concerned about the sustainability of its public finances (the annual budget deficit could hit a staggering $1 trillion in 2020). Some reaction to the IMF\u2019s report: The IMF has upgraded its forecast for UK growth by 0.1% this year to 1.6%, from 1.5% last October. But growth in 2019 has been lowered by 0.1% to 1.5%. That would see Britain lag behind the eurozone, which is expected to grow by 2.4% this year and 2% in 2019. The IMF has also warned America against triggering a trade war with China. In an unusually forthright comment, Maurice Obstfeld said the recent tariffs pushed through by Donald Trump will push America deeper into the red: He says: \u201cThese initiatives will do little\u2026 to change the multilateral or overall US external current account deficit, which owes primarily to a level of aggregate US spending that continues to exceed total income. \u201cRecent US fiscal measures will actually widen the US current account deficit. NEWSFLASH: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the world\u2019s trade system is in peril, as the showdown between America and China over tariffs threatens to boil over. The warning comes in the IMF\u2019s latest assessment of the global economy, which is being released in Washington now. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, singled out the dangers of protectionism, saying: The first shots in a potential trade war have now been fired.\u201d \u201cThe multilateral rules-based trade system that evolved after world war two and that nurtured unprecedented growth in the world economy needs strengthening. Instead, it is in danger of being torn apart.\u201d Obstfeld also took aim at populism, saying: \u201cThe renewed popularity of nationalistic policies is another after-effect of the financial crisis and its prolonged aftermath.\u201d But despite these concerns, the IMF expects the global economy to grow by 3.9% in 2018 and 2019 -- 0.2 percentage points higher than six months ago. Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s labour market figures: Confusingly, there\u2019s some disagreement over whether Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze has actually ended. It all depends which inflation measure you choose -- the benchmark Consumer Price Index (CPI), or CPIH, which includes housing costs. Then there\u2019s the choice between basic pay, and total pay (including bonuses). Fortunately, today\u2019s figures both came in at +2.8% for February. Once you\u2019ve cleared that hurdle, there\u2019s the question of whether to take the most recent monthly inflation figure, or the average of the last three months. The Office for National Statistics favours CPIH, which was 2.7% in December and January and 2.5% in February - comfortably below February\u2019s wage growth. Thus, the ONS says that real wages are rising. But the Treasury prefers to use the average of CPI over the last three months - which, at 2.9%, is still slightly above nominal earnings. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve not heard the government celebrating the end of the pay squeeze. The media, though, are generally taking February\u2019s CPI reading (2.7%) and declaring that real wages are back (just!). Over in the eurozone, German investor confidence has tumbled into negative territory. The German economic sentiment index, calculated by research institute ZEW, has slumped to -8.2 this month, from +5.1 in March. That\u2019s the lowest reading since November 2012, when the eurozone crisis was hurting confidence. ZEW blamed the decline on fears of a global trade war, and recent data showing that German exports and production output have both fallen sharply earlier this year. Carsten Brzeski of ING called today\u2019s ZEW reading a \u201cdisastrous outcome\u201d, which bolsters fears that Germany\u2019s growth is slowing. He added: The German economy had a start to forget in the first two months of the year. In fact, while the weakening of soft data could still be labelled as a levelling off from record highs, hard data in Germany and the entire Eurozone have clearly disappointed. At least in Germany, it would require a strong rebound in March to prevent an unexpected weak first quarter. Nevertheless, there are good reasons to blame exceptional factors like the weather, the timing of vacation and the flu for weaker economic activity in the first two months. Sound fundamentals still bode well for growth in the coming months. Let\u2019s also not forget that up to now, trade tensions are noise for the economic outlook and central banks, rather than hard reality. Here\u2019s Margaret Greenwood MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, on today\u2019s jobs data: \u201cAfter nearly eight years of austerity, average wages are still lower than they were before the financial crash a decade ago. It is shameful that over 4 million children are growing up in poverty. \u201cWhile we welcome that there are more people in work, these figures mask serious inequalities in the labour market, including the employment gap faced by women, disabled people and BAME groups who have too often borne the brunt of austerity cuts. \u201cA Labour government will make tackling poverty an immediate priority with a real Living Wage of \u00a310 per hour by 2020, an end to the public sector pay cap and urgent reforms to the government\u2019s deeply flawed Universal Credit programme.\u201d With unemployment at a 42-year low, many firms are struggling to fill vacant positions. Today\u2019s labour market report shows there were 815,000 job vacancies in the last quarter, which is 44,000 more than for a year ago. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg is hopeful that this gives workers the upper hand in wage negotiations (despite the IoD\u2019s misgivings). He writes~: Accelerating wage growth, low and stabilising unemployment \u2013 the UK seems to be approaching full employment. Employment gains are slowing despite record high labour demand. Instead, wage growth is edging up nicely as the degree of mismatch between the skills of the remaining workers and the skills demanded by firms increases. With inflation expected to fall back towards 2% this year (from 2.7% in February) Pickering reckons real weekly earnings growth can rise towards 1.0% by the end of the 2018. The pound has slipped back from the 22-month high struck this morning, and is now down 0.2% against the US dollar at $1.4319. That\u2019s a little surprising, given this morning\u2019s pick-up in basic pay. It may reflect the fact that total pay (including bonuses) only rise by 2.8% -- weaker than the 3% expected. Anthony Gillham, Old Mutual Wealth\u2019s head of multi-asset, points out that wage growth is still rather anaemic - leaving some households vulnerable to an interest rate rise: \u201cAlthough symbolic, wage growth is still only marginally above the rate of inflation and the 2.8% increase has actually come in under expectations. This relatively sluggish wage growth is despite unemployment falling to its lowest level in over 40 years. It is somewhat disappointing that wage growth hasn\u2019t come through more powerfully given that there is really very little room for unemployment to fall any further. \u201cAlthough wage growth does strengthen the outlook for the UK fractionally, it does not change the fact that over the long-term consumers have still seen real pay suffer since the financial crisis. And it is worth bearing in mind that with increased minimum pension contribution rates coming into effect this month, disposable income may even come down. The Institute of Directors has poured a little cold water over today\u2019s data, by warning that bosses will struggle to keep raising workers\u2019 pay. The IoD\u2019s senior economist, Tej Parikh, says the worst of the pay squeeze seems to be over - but questions whether the \u201cforward momentum\u201d on hiring and wage growth can be sustained. With skilled labour in short supply, productivity - long the bugbear of the UK economy - is crucial, Parikh explains: Many employers are already straining to fill vacancies due to chronic labour shortages, which have been compounded in a number of sectors, including social care and hospitality, by the notable drop in the number of migrants coming to the UK. \u201cA further pick-up in salaries will also be restrained by the limited ability of SMEs \u2013 which employ 60 percent of the workforce \u2013 to compete for a shrinking pool of labour. As such, small business owners will need greater support in managing regulatory costs and raising their productivity if wage growth is to become a long-lasting facet of our economy.\u201d Via Resolution Foundation, here\u2019s confirmation that real pay (wage increases minus inflation) is rising fastest in the financial world but still shrinking in the public sector, and beyond.... The small boost from the pick-up in wages could be wiped out for many borrowers if the Bank of England raises interest rates. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, says people should tackle their spending before the next rate hike lands: \u201cNow isn\u2019t the time to start splashing the cash, you should make hay while the sun shines and keep control of your spending. Create a budget and make sure you aren\u2019t spending any more than you need too. Spend 30 minutes looking at where you could make savings, from switching where you do your weekly shop to changing your energy supplier. Half an hour of research and admin could save you hundreds, if not thousands a year.\u201d This chart shows how wages have caught up with inflation, after around a year of falling real pay: And this one shows how the jobless rate is the lowest since Harold Wilson\u2019s premiership: Britain\u2019s unions have welcomed the news that workers\u2019 pay has finally caught up with rising prices - but warned that earnings are still too weak: TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says the government must do more: Unions have negotiated pay rises for workers across the UK, from the counters at McDonald\u2019s to the factory floor at Ford. \u201cBut wage growth is still weak. Workers are \u00a314 a week worse off than they were in 2007 \u2013 with pay packets not expected to return to their pre-crisis level until 2025. \u201cThis is why tens of thousands of people will march through London on Saturday 12 May as part of the TUC\u2019s \u2018A New Deal for Working People\u2019 demonstration. \u201cThe government must get the economy working again for working people. Ministers need to increase the minimum wage to \u00a310 an hour, fund a proper pay rise for all public servants, and give workers stronger rights to negotiate fair pay deals.\u201d (That 0.2% figure is based on CPIH - a measure of inflation including housing costs. If you use the Consumer Prices Index, real wages are up by 0.1%). Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Esther McVey, has hailed the news that Britain\u2019s employment rate has hit a new all-time high. She says: \u201cAnother milestone for employment has been reached under this Government as employment reaches a record high, up 3.2 million since 2010 - the 16th time the employment record has been broken in the same period. \u201cThat means on average, over 1,000 people have moved into work every day since 2010, and credit has to be given to the businesses who have created those jobs and the individuals who are taking those opportunities. This chart, from today\u2019s labour market report, shows how the employment rate has climbed to 75.4%: Tara Sinclair of George Washington University tweets: All this talk of pay rises may have a hollow ring in Britain\u2019s public sector, where the government\u2019s austerity programme has kept wage growth pinned on the mat for several years. The Resolution Foundation points out that pay is not rising uniformly across the UK - instead, those in the City have been enjoying inflation-busting pay rises for a while: Real pay (adjusted for inflation) has been rising by almost 2.8 per cent for those in finance for the past year, and 1.5 per cent for those in construction, yet the squeeze continues in the public sector. Stephen Clarke, Senior Economic Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, adds: \u201cToday\u2019s figures confirm that Britain passed an important living standards milestone in early 2018 as its 12-month pay squeeze finally ended. Wages should continue to strengthen over the course of the year as inflation falls back. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see pay finally back in positive territory, but Britain has a lot of ground to make up after an awful decade of pay squeezes, stagnation and all too fleeting recoveries. On average, people are still taking home less than they did before the crisis. My colleague Richard Partington points out that falling inflation, rather than bumper pay rises, is behind the pick-up in real wages: That\u2019s because the slump in the pound since the EU referendum has now largely passed through the economic system, especially given sterling\u2019s recent rally. Geraint Johnes, research director at the Work Foundation and Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, says the UK jobs market is \u201cgradually returning to a healthy state\u201d. He adds: These trends seem to confirm that the labour market is gradually returning to a more stable state following a period in which many workers took on gig employment as a stop-gap in the aftermath of the recession.\u201d Borrowers beware! While the pick-up in wages is welcome, it could also prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75% next month. Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, explains: \u201cFor the first time in more than a year, British workers are not feeling progressively poorer month by month.... Wage growth has been the missing piece of the puzzle in Britain\u2019s long, slow recovery from the financial crisis. With the final piece now in place the Bank of England now has the catalyst to be able to follow through on its plans to raise interest rates at the next MPC meeting in May and start the move back towards monetary normality. Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, says the real wage squeeze on the average UK worker is coming to an end (and not before time!). While most of this improvement has been due to a collapse in inflation \u2013 something that should be shown to have continued tomorrow \u2013 businesses are paying higher wages as the labour market in the UK tightens. Unemployment is currently at its lowest level since the mid-1970s and hopefully, that will propel higher wages for months to come. As we have noted before, real wage gains are the silver bullet for the UK economy. Real wage growth is significant because it relies on optimistic employers being happy with business conditions, it allows consumers to re-balance spending figures from credit uptake and it promotes growth in generalised output with a central bank more comfortable to normalise monetary policy.\u201d In another boost, Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has hit a new 42-year low of just 4.2%, as more people find jobs. Today\u2019s labour market report shows that there are now 32.26 million people in work, 427,000 more than a year ago. The number of people classed as unemployed has dropped by 136,000 over the last year, and now stands at 1.42 million. And the employment rate has hit 75.4%, the highest since records began in 1971. Basic pay in the UK is now rising at its fastest rate since August 2015, as this chart from the ONS shows: Pay including bonuses also rose by 2.8% over the last quarter. That\u2019s weaker than the 3% which economists expected, but is still just ahead of February\u2019s inflation rate (we get March\u2019s figures tomorrow). BREAKING: Pay increases in the UK have finally overtaken inflation, after a year-long wage squeeze. Basic earnings rose by 2.8% per year in the three months to February, new figures from the Office for National Statistic show. That means they rose a little faster than inflation, which dipped to 2.7% in February. This is the first time in around a year that wages have risen faster than the cost of living - and means real wages are now rising by 0.1%. That\u2019s a small but important step towards ending the cost of living squeeze. The Office for National Statistics says: Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in real terms (that is, adjusted for price inflation) increased by 0.2% excluding bonuses, and by 0.1% including bonuses, compared with a year earlier. More to follow.... You can get up to speed on the UK labour market with these tweets from economist Rupert Seggins: Just over 15 minutes to go until the UK labour market report is released, and tension is growing in the City. Viraj Patel, FX strategist at ING, says: \u201cIt seems that we\u2019re back to good old-fashioned U.K. data watching to determine the short-term direction for the currency. A 3% wage growth print in today\u2019s U.K. jobs report should seal the deal for a May BOE hike.\u201d The pound is continuing to strengthen, and just touched a new 22-month high of $1.4376 against the US dollar. Sterling had now risen for eight trading days in a row, as the City braces for UK interest rates to rise in May. It may also show that worries over a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 are easing. Speaking of China....Beijing has hit back at America after Donald Trump accused it of currency manipulation. A China\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman told reporters that information coming out of United States regarding the Chinese currency is \u201ca bit chaotic\u201d, following the president\u2019s comments on Twitter. Here\u2019s the tweet in question: This is part of Trump\u2019s long-running claim that other countries are cheating America by keeping their currencies too low. But.... one could argue that Trump is actually guilty of currency manipulation, as his wilder moves can prompt traders to sell the dollar: As Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale puts it: What matters now is the nervousness induced by both President Trump\u2019s late-cycle fiscal largesse and his twitter feed. Yesterday\u2019s observation that Russian and China are playing the currency devaluation game was an eyebrow-raiser. Overnight, China reported that its economy grew by 6.8% in the first three months of this year. That broadly matched estimates, calming worries that the Chinese economy might be cooling. However, separate date showed that industrial output missed expectations and company investment has slowed. European stock markets have risen in early trading, taking their cue from Wall Street which rallied yesterday. Royal Bank of Canada are also eagerly awaiting today\u2019s UK labour market report. They say: It is expected that the unemployment rate holds at 4.3% for what would be the seventh month in the last eight. Of most interest though is likely to be the news on average earnings growth. The including-bonus measure looks as though it could hit 2.9% 3m/y from 2.8% 3m/y, and if the ex-bonus measure reaches 2.8% 3m/y, as expected, then it will be the highest rate since August 2015 and help reinforce the case for a May Bank Rate hike Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group predicts that the today\u2019s UK jobs report could drive the pound higher - if wages have indeed picked up in recent weeks: Traders are looking optimistically towards today\u2019s UK jobs data, with expectations that it will support a Spring rate rise by the central bank [Bank of England]. Whilst UK unemployment is forecast to remain constant at 4.3%, average earnings are forecast to hit 3% in the three months to February. Given that inflation was 2.7% in February we could start to finally see the pressure of falling wages in real terms ease for the UK consumer. A strong reading could pile the pressure on the BoE to hike rates as good inflationary pressures pick up, potentially pushing GBP/USD to $1.45. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After a year of pain, Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze could finally be easing. New earnings figures released this morning are expected to show that pay has overtaken inflation, for the first time since last spring. Economists predicts that average basic pay grew by 2.8% per year in the three months to February. Chuck in bonuses too, and pay packets may have grown by up to 3%. That would overtake inflation, which dropped to 2.7% in February, meaning pay packets are no longer being totally eroded by the cost of living. This would be welcome news for hard-pressed households....and would also raise the chances that the Bank of England hikes interest rates next month. The pound has already reacted, by hitting a 22-month high this morning. At $1.4360, sterling is its strongest against the US dollar since the Brexit vote of June 2016. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: It has already been established that a significant number of Bank of England policymakers are expecting wages to start outstripping headline inflation in the coming months, and today\u2019s average earnings number for the three months to February, could well be the first sign post on the way to that becoming a reality. The jobs data may also show that Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has stuck at just 4.3%, a 42-year low. Also coming up today... The International Monetary Fund will release its latest assessment of the global economy, as its Spring Meeting gets underway in Washington. Investors will also be watching the situation in the Middle East closely, following last weekend\u2019s strikes in Syria. Any signs that the situation is escalating could hit stocks: On the corporate front, Associated British Foods has reported a pick-up of sales at its Primark operation. It adds: Primark performed well with profit growth of 4% achieved against a backdrop of unseasonable weather in Europe and a margin decline following the adverse effect of currency on purchases. High street retailer JD Sports has also defied the high street gloom, by reporting a 24% increase in profits for the last year. Drinks retailer Majestic Wine has announced a new growth strategy. It is planning to invest up to \u00a312m to win new customers - which will make a dent in its short-term profits: Here\u2019s the agenda: 9.30am BST: UK labour market report 10am BST: The ZEW institute publishes its survey of German economic sentiment 2pm BST: IMF releases its World Economic Outlook",

      "bodyText": "Primark\u2019s owners said the UK high street was \u201cnot remotely dead\u201d as the cut-price fashion chain revealed sales growth and plans for new stores despite troubles at many of its rivals. The retailer, which does not sell online and so misses the big consumer switch towards buying from laptops, tablets and phones, nevertheless said sales rose 3% at established UK stores in the six months to 3 March. Strong growth of denim, puffa jackets and slogan tops powered growth in the UK despite the snow and cold weather caused by the so-called \u201cbeast from the east\u201d in late February and unseasonably warm October when sales fell back strongly. John Bason, the finance director of Primark\u2019s parent company, Associated British Foods (ABF), said: \u201cWe are trading extremely well. For all people say about footfall on the high street we wouldn\u2019t be getting these numbers if more people weren\u2019t coming into our stores.\u201d He added: \u201cThe UK high street is not remotely dead. Online is growing but we are growing too.\u201d The retailer opened two UK new stores, in Charlton, south-east London, and Staines in Surrey, and plans to open two more, in Burnley and at Westfield\u2019s west London mall, in the next six months. It is also opening stores in Germany, France, Spain and the US, where it will move into Florida late next year. It said the fledgling US chain had \u201cmade progress\u201d. Primark is increasing market share in the UK despite troubles at rivals including New Look, H&amp;M and Mothercare. New Look is closing up to 60 stores as part of a rescue restructure while Mothercare is thought to be considering a similar move that may involve the closure of almost half of its 152 UK stores. H&amp;M was left with a backlog of clothing after weak sales blamed on the cold weather. Retailers are struggling with a switch to online shopping and low consumer confidence. Last month, shopper numbers slumped 6%, the steepest drop since the end of 2010, as dismal weather kept them at home. Shares in ABF were up nearly 4% , although analysts were disappointed by an overall 1.5% fall in underlying sales at Primark in the half year, as sales at established outlets in northern Europe were affected by unseasonable weather and the opening of additional Primark stores nearby. Sports fashion and outdoorwear group JD Sports also rose above the retail gloom as it reported a 33% rise in sales to \u00a33.1bn and 24% rise in pretax profits to \u00a3294.5m. The retailer, which is benefiting from the \u201cathleisure\u201d trend and a shift towards more casual footwear in everyday life, said sales at its established stores across Europe rose 3% while sales of sportswear online jumped more than 30%. JD Sports shares were up nearly 5%, the biggest riser on the FTSE 250.",

      "bodyText": "British workers have seen their first real pay rise in a year, as average wage growth overcomes the fading inflationary effects of the Brexit vote. Bringing to an end 12 months of falling living standards, the latest snapshot of Britain\u2019s job market from the Office for National Statistics showed pay rising above inflation for the first time since January 2017. In the three months to February, average weekly earnings excluding bonuses increased by 2.8% from the same period a year ago. While that was unchanged from January \u2013 and missed economists\u2019 forecasts for growth of 3% \u2013 the ONS said it was still enough to hand workers a real pay rise. Inflation has been falling in recent months, with the consumer price index dipping to 2.7% in February, as the impact of the fall in the value of the pound straight after the EU referendum begins to fade. At one point on Tuesday, the value of sterling hit a post-vote high against the dollar of $1.4376, before falling back. Despite the better news, some economists said it was too early to declare the return of real wage growth because there were two ways to measure average wage growth versus inflation. The ONS says real pay grew by 0.2% in the three months to February, set against its preferred measure for inflation, which includes housing costs. Typically lower than the consumer price index (CPI), the rate known as CPIH was 2.6% in the three months to February. Officials at the Treasury do not measure pay growth in the same way. On their barometer, using the average rate of CPI over the three months of 2.9%, real wage growth has yet to return. The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to its lowest level since 1975 in the three months to February, putting borrowers on notice for the Bank of England to raise interest rates from as early as next month. The number of people in work also reached a record high of 32.2 million as 55,000 more people started a job, giving an employment rate of 75.4%. The number of job vacancies remained close to the record high reached in December, hovering at 815,000, amid fears of labour shortages triggered by Brexit. The work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, said: \u201cDay by day we are helping people turn their lives round by getting into employment. Jobs are key to transforming lives and work is the best route out of poverty.\u201d The boost for the economy comes after freezing weather from the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d forced diggers to fall idle and shoppers to stay home. Economists expect further rises in earnings during the year, but they say Britain still needs to make up a lot of ground after a decade of poor performance. According to the Resolution Foundation, average annual earnings are still almost \u00a3800 a year lower than they were 10 years ago, while the gains have been unequal across different sectors of the economy. Real pay has been rising by almost 2.8% for those in finance for the past year and 1.5% for those in construction, but there has been a continued squeeze in the public sector. The TUC said workers\u2019 pay packets are forecast to remain below their pre-crisis levels until the middle of the next decade. Its general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThe government must get the economy working again for working people. Ministers need to increase the minimum wage to \u00a310 an hour, fund a proper pay rise for all public servants, and give workers stronger rights to negotiate fair pay deals.\u201d According to government estimates uncovered by Labour, average real earnings will be \u00a31,733 lower in 2021 than they were forecast to be in November 2016. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: \u201cThese figures are truly damning, and show that it is working people who are picking up the tab for Tories\u2019 economic failure.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "World trade system in danger of being torn apart, warns IMF", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The postwar global trading system risks being torn apart, the International Monetary Fund has warned, amid concern over the tariff showdown between the US and China. In a sign of its growing concern that protectionism is being stimulated by voter scepticism, the IMF used its half-yearly health check for the world economy to tell policymakers they needed to address the public\u2019s concerns before a better-than-expected period of growth came to an end. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, said: \u201cThe first shots in a potential trade war have now been fired.\u201d He said Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts would suck imports into the US and increase the size of the trade deficit 2019 by $150bn \u2013 a trend that could exacerbate trade tensions. \u201cThe multilateral rules-based trade system that evolved after world war two and that nurtured unprecedented growth in the world economy needs strengthening. Instead, it is in danger of being torn apart.\u201d Obstfeld said there was more of a \u201cphoney war\u201d between the US and China than a return to the widespread use of tariffs in the Great Depression, but that there were signs that even the threat of protectionism was already harming growth. \u201cThat major economies are flirting with trade war at a time of widespread economic expansion may seem paradoxical \u2013 especially when the expansion is so reliant on investment and trade,\u201d Obstfeld added. But public optimism about the benefits of globalisation had been eroded because of the growing gap between rich and poor and the fact that many households in the west had seen little or no benefit from growth, he said. \u201cIf policymakers are complacent and do not tackle the challenge of strengthening long-term growth, political risks could intensify, possibly reversing some of the progress that economic reforms and integration have achieved to date.\u201d His warning came as the IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook predicted the growth in 2018 and 2019 would be the strongest and broadest-based since 2010, when there was an initial sharp bounce back from the global recession of 2008-09. The fund said it expected expansion of 3.9% this year and next \u2013 up by 0.2 points in each year from the October WEO. The WEO said its biggest growth upgrade since October had been for the US, which is expected to expand by 2.9% in 2018 and 2.7% in 2019 \u2013 up from the 2.3% and 1.9% forecast in October. The eurozone is also expected to outperform previous forecasts, with growth of 2.4% in 2018 and 2.0% in 2019, up by 0.5 and 0.3 points, respectively. The IMF made only modest changes to its forecasts for the UK. It said growth was on course to be 0.1 point higher in 2018, at 1.6%, but 0.1 point lower in 2019, at 1.5%. By 2023, the IMF expects UK growth to be 1.6%, slightly higher than the 1.4% pencilled in for the eurozone. Obstfeld said this forecast was a best-case assumption based on a Brexit deal that involved zero tariffs and favourable access to the EU for the City. Growth would still be lower than it would have been had the UK remained a member of the EU. Despite the UK\u2019s muted growth prospects, the IMF gave its blessing to interest rate increases from the Bank of England, noting that unemployment was close to record lows and further falls could add to wage pressures at a time when inflation was already above the government\u2019s 2% target. The fund said strong growth would help dispel some of the remaining legacies of the financial crisis of a decade ago, by accelerating the end to unconventional monetary policies such as quantitative easing, boosting investment and healing labour market scars. \u201cOther after-effects of the crisis seem more durable, however, including higher debt levels worldwide and widespread public scepticism about policymakers\u2019 capacity and willingness to generate robust and inclusive growth,\u201d Obstfeld added.",

Instead, it is in danger of being torn apart.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>Obstfeld said there was more of a \u201cphoney war\u201d between the US and China than a return to the widespread use of tariffs in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/04/crash-1929-wall-street-what-the-great-depression-reveals-about-our-future\">Great Depression</a>, but that there were signs that even the threat of protectionism was already harming growth.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat major economies are flirting with trade war at a time of widespread economic expansion may seem paradoxical \u2013 especially when the expansion is so reliant on investment and trade,\u201d Obstfeld added.</p> \n<p>But public optimism about the benefits of globalisation had been eroded because of the growing gap between rich and poor and the fact that many households in the west had seen little or no benefit from growth, he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf policymakers are complacent and do not tackle the challenge of strengthening long-term growth, political risks could intensify, possibly reversing some of the progress that economic reforms and integration have achieved to date.\u201d</p> \n<p>His warning came as the IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook predicted the growth in 2018 and 2019 would be the strongest and broadest-based since 2010, when there was an initial sharp bounce back from the global recession of 2008-09. The fund said it expected expansion of 3.9% this year and next \u2013 up by 0.2 points in each year from the <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2017/09/19/world-economic-outlook-october-2017\">October WEO</a>. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/17/imf-global-recovery-protectionism-globalisation-growth\">The IMF has a simple message: the global recovery will peter out</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The WEO said its biggest growth upgrade since October had been for the US, which is expected to expand by 2.9% in 2018 and 2.7% in 2019 \u2013 up from the 2.3% and 1.9% forecast in October. The eurozone is also expected to outperform previous forecasts, with growth of 2.4% in 2018 and 2.0% in 2019, up by 0.5 and 0.3 points, respectively.</p> \n<p>The IMF made only modest changes to its forecasts for the UK. It said growth was on course to be 0.1 point higher in 2018, at 1.6%, but 0.1 point lower in 2019, at 1.5%.</p> \n<p>By 2023, the IMF expects UK growth to be 1.6%, slightly higher than the 1.4% pencilled in for the eurozone. Obstfeld said this forecast was a best-case assumption based on a Brexit deal that involved zero tariffs and favourable access to the EU for the City.

Bob Mackenzie is making the claim based on what he says could be the value of shares the company awarded him under a long-term bonus plan. However, the AA says he is no longer entitled to the shares after his dismissal for gross misconduct on 1 August. Announcing results for the year to 31 January 2018, the board said it had not set aside any sum for damages and expected to be able to recoup legal costs of about \u00a31m. \u201cThe group has not made a provision for these amounts, as the group expects to be successful in rigorously defending these claims,\u201d the AA said. \u201cHowever, the group will incur legal costs of approximately \u00a31m to defend these claims during the next two financial years, which it would seek to recover from Bob Mackenzie when the litigation concludes.\u201d Mackenzie\u2019s late-night altercation with the AA\u2019s Mike Lloyd took place last summer in the bar of the five-star Pennyhill Park hotel in Surrey, and was captured on CCTV. Mackenzie\u2019s lawyers are understood to be claiming he was wrongfully dismissed, having been under extreme pressure, and should be entitled to damages. They will also say that the company had excluded him from talks over a proposed merger between the AA\u2019s insurance business and rival Hastings, which they say was a factor in the incident. Friends and family members have said the company had placed extreme pressure on Mackenzie, who was \u201cnot well\u201d and had mixed the prescription drug diazepam with alcohol before the attack. He had been executive chairman of the AA since 2014, when he was instrumental in the stock market flotation. Simon Breakwell, the AA\u2019s chief executive since September, said the sacking ad not overshadowed the company\u2019s \u201csolid performance\u201d during the year. Revenue rose by 2% to \u00a3959m, while pretax profit increased by \u00a341m to \u00a3141m. However, the AA said it had faced higher costs from its reliance on third-party garages at peak times and during the bad weather, when its vans were too busy to attend callouts. The company is hoping to capitalise on its \u201ccar genie\u201d device, launched in August with the potential to predict up to one-third of breakdowns for customers before they happen, according to the AA. It is now in use in 6,000 vehicles. Breakwell said investment in technology would reduce the company\u2019s short-term profitability, but was \u201cvital to our long-term success\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "In February I ordered a Toshiba TV from Amazon which was delivered by Hermes. When I turned it on I discovered the screen was cracked and asked Amazon for a replacement. The new one \u2013 again delivered by Hermes \u2013 was fine, but I had to arrange the return of the faulty one. I decided to use Hermes again and paid the delivery fee (to be refunded by Amazon), repacking the faulty TV After the collection, I didn\u2019t hear anything for several days so decided to \u201ctrack\u201d my parcel. It had arrived at Hermes\u2019 local depot and gone no further. Hermes initially told me they had lost it but I could make a claim for compensation. It then told me that they do not compensate for TVs \u2013 as in their terms and conditions. I had, foolishly, assumed that as Amazon used Hermes to deliver, it would be the best choice to send it back. Now Amazon has charged me the full price for the missing TV, \u00a3408.97. So I have paid twice plus the Hermes delivery charge; a total of \u00a3828.23. It never occurred to me that Hermes could \u201close\u201d a parcel the size of the packed TV. Hermes is adamant it will not compensate me. And Amazon, despite my pleadings, insists its policy is to charge for items not returned. SH, Brixton, London SW2 Amazon has apologised and given you a full refund of the cost of the TV and delivery charge. Hermes says the confusion is because, while Hermes does deliver TVs on behalf of some retailers, its separate \u201cmyHermes\u201d service (which you apparently used) \u2013 for small businesses/consumers/returns etc which is bookable online \u2013 will not compensate for loss or damage to certain items such as TVs. The myHermes website has the list of excluded items which shows that TVs are not covered by compensation for loss or damage. It says you should have seen this when you ordered the delivery. Hermes adds: \u201cWe would like to apologise to SH for the inconvenience caused and are pleased that the matter has been settled satisfactorily. Over the course of the year more than 99% of the 300m parcels we deliver arrive without any problems. \u201cHowever, we always advise customers to check whether the items they are sending or returning are on the excluded items list, which is detailed very clearly on our website during the booking process.\u201d We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
