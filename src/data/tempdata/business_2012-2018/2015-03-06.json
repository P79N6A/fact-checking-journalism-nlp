      "bodyText": "PS: Here\u2019s our news story on the Greek proposals: Wired-up tax snoopers could be unleashed in Greece (if you\u2019re just joining us, there\u2019s lots of reaction further back in this blog. GW) And finally... Greece\u2019s government, despite the carping, is determined to end this week on a triumphant note. Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith has received a new \u201cnon-paper\u201d from Syriza\u2019s indefatigable press ministry, which declares: \u201cOnce again the Cassandras who foresaw catastrophe for the country, and a credit crunch that would lead Greece to bankruptcy, have been disproved. The instalment [debt obligation] of \u20ac310m to the IMF went normally and was paid, while issuance of T-bills worth \u20ac1.4bn happened successfully .. the situation is absolutely manageable.\u201d [yes, we know, Cassandra was right, don\u2019t shoot the messenger, eh?] Back to the statement... and, lambasting those who had foreseen \u201cthe end of the world\u201d on February 28 when Athens\u2019 EU-IMF backed bailout program was due to end, the government says Greece was acting on and realizing its commitments. At the euro group on Monday the process of working on the proposal Greece had submitted would begin, it said adding that that \u201cwill be the spark that will change the climate and the decisions of the ECB.\u201d And on Thursday 12, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will visit Paris to hold talks with Angel Gurria, the former Mexican finance minister and head of the OECD \u201cabout the reforms that will take place in Greece so that public administration can be reorganized to fight tax evasion and so that social justice is reestablished.\u201d And that is probably all for tonight, and indeed the week. Thanks all, and have a very good weekend. GW In other news, a lawmaker from the Neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party has been cleared of charges related to an attack on two female left-wing colleagues during a live TV talk show in 2012. Associated Press reports: An Athens court found this afternoon that Ilias Kassidiaris did not cause the women grievous bodily harm, as he had been charged. TV footage of the 2012 incident showed Kassidiaris repeatedly slapping one woman and throwing a glass of water at another before running away. The attack followed an exchange of verbal abuse... Kassidiaris was not convicted of plain assault, because that would have required a formal complaint from his victims, that was never made, AP adds. You can see a clip of the infamous incident here. Peter Spiegel, the FT\u2019s man in Brussels, reports that Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s letter has not impressed officials there: ...The reaction from eurozone officials to the undercover tourist plan \u2014 one said staff laughed out loud when they read the proposal \u2014 is the latest evidence of the growing gap between the Greek government and its international bailout lenders, at a time when Athens could be less than two weeks away from running out of cash completely. \u201cIt\u2019s quite hilarious, if it were not so tragic, that this is what a government in an industrialised country comes up with,\u201d said one eurozone official involved in the talks. Another complaint about the undercover tax inspector plan is that it will target small-scale tax evasion, not the wealthy that the Syriza government has vowed to rein in. Analyst Dan Davies of Frontline Analysts tweets: Of course, the seven proposals in today\u2019s letter (online at the FT) aren\u2019t the end of the matter. Greece must has more plans up its sleeve, as it moves towards that third bailout, or \u201cContract for Recovery and Growth\u201d. Given the scale of tax evasion worldwide, it feels wrong to knock the Greek finance ministry for proposing a clampdown. So, if wiring up concerned members of the public and tourists is questionable, is there a better way? Well, Greece could learn from Slovakia\u2019s example. It roped in its civilians to help, by collecting all their sales receipts for anything over one euro, whether at a store or a restaurant. As my colleague Jana Kasperkevic explains: Each receipt is printed with the business\u2019s company tax ID. Slovakian authorities want citizens to go home, look up the receipt with the tax ID, and enter it into a national database. The Slovakian finance ministry will look through the database to double-check that the businesses are correctly reporting their income \u2013 or so they say. And citizens were offered the carrot of a free prize draw for taking part. Can the IRS tap citizen power to police tax-evading corporations? Or Athens could look to Israel. According to Bloomberg\u2019s Stephen Mihm, the Israeli authorities tackled a deep-seated aversion to tax payments in the 1970s by imposing tougher penalties, simplifying the system, and making tax offices less confrontional and more friendly. Mihm says: Such subtle interventions were bolstered by a huge public-relations campaign to change the attitude toward taxes. The government introduced lessons about taxation into the secondary school system, the armed forces and other institutions; it also flooded the country with pamphlets and advertising, and offered tours of tax offices. The government sought to convey the sense that taxation wasn\u2019t an evil to be avoided, but the price of citizenship. It even built a museum of taxation (it so impressed U.S. officials that the Internal Revenue Service built one, too). The government commissioned a short propaganda film (\u201cThe Tsippori Affair\u201d), which followed the travails of a man who discovers that government ceases to function when he evades taxes. By avoiding single-minded, heavy-handed interventions (as countries such as Argentina did, unsuccessfully) Israel fixed its problem. By the 1970s, tax evasion had largely disappeared, and Israel became an adviser to other countries struggling to collect taxes from their recalcitrant citizenry. Hugo Dixon of Reuters reckons we\u2019re being too negative about the innovative scheme... Over in Athens Helena Smith has just spoken to Aliki Mouriki, a senior sociologist at the National Centre for Social Research who described the proposed reforms as resembling more of \u201ca wish list\u201d than a catalogue of quantifiable figure-backed proposals that euro zone creditor countries would accept. In their current form, it was hard to conceive how the reforms would pass muster. \u201cIt\u2019s a wish list at the moment,\u201d she told Helena, adding: \u201cBut on the other hand, I do think our creditors should give us some breathing space when things are so fluid and there is just no liquidity in the economy to come up, let alone commit, with statistics and figures.\u201d As for the idea of undercover agents acting as tax inspectors, Mouriki said: \u201cYou can\u2019t expect to have serious results handing over this sort of job to amateurs. It\u2019s too serious a buziness to hand over to tourists and housewives.\u201d Tweet of the day! More reaction to the tax evasion proposal: Not everyone is against the plan, though. Herakles Galanakopoulos, an accountant who specialises in tax issues, told the Guardian that at a time when the need for revenues had reached crisis point,the government had to think of novel ways to combat the scourge. \u201cWhy not resort to such measures? We wouldn\u2019t be the first.\u201d. \u201cThe government has to find some way of dealing with this problem - the state urgently needs revenues.\u201d The head of the Greek Tourist Confederation, SETE, has also questioned whether Greece can really expect tourists to wear secret recording equipment to catch tax evaders, as proposed in that letter to Brussels today. Speaking to the Guardian, SETE\u2019s chief Andreas Andreadis said the best way to beat tax evasion would be through exclusive use of credit cards and tax rebates (as proposed by two German MPs this week). Andreas Andreadis told Athens correspondent Helena Smith that: \u201cYou cannot ask tourists or Greeks to spy.\u201d \u201cThe most practical way of tackling tax evasion, which could be started as a pilot program in tourist areas, would be simply to forbid cash transactions above \u20ac100,\u201d \u201cPaying by credit card would automatically force the transaction to be shown on the cash register. They will say people don\u2019t have credit cards but that is rubbish. Another practical way would be to give tax benefits to those who collect receipts as German MPs recently proposed.\u201d Germans lead the league tables in arrivals in Greece - more than 2.5 million visited last year and as many are expected to descend on the country this summer. PS: if you\u2019re just joining us, this proposal is included in an 11-page letter apparently sent by finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, ahead of next Monday\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers. Here\u2019s a flavour: (see earlier post for more) One well-placed government insider has told Helena Smith that \u201cI think heads will roll after this,\u201d [the secret tax inspector plan], adding: \u201cThese proposals are simply outlandish.\u201d Roping in the support of tourists to spy on tax evaders rather stretched the definition of the word \u201ctourist\u201d to breaking point, another one said. \u201cThey\u2019re meant to be on holiday. That is the definition of a tourist.\u201d News of Greece\u2019s proposal to deploy undercover tax agents has sparked widespread disbelief in Greece, reports our Helena Smith. Of all the measures employed to crack down on the traditional sport of tax evasion in Greece, hiring wired undercover \u201csecret agents\u201d - including tourists - cuts the cake and has been greeted with ridicule. For example: German tourists may leap at the chance of keeping Greece honest, while taking in some Aegean sun: The Greek government has also announced this afternoon that delayed legislation to re-open the state-run TV channel, ERT, will be presented to Athens\u2019 parliament on Monday. As this blog reported earlier in the week, the new leftist-led government\u2019s plan to present reforms this week was delayed after it became clear that the cost impact of many of the changes would take days to calculate. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Sources close to prime minister Alexis Tsipras this afternoon confirmed that legislation to reopen ERT - shut down by the former coalition government in a controversial moves almost two year ago - would be brought before the 300-member House on Monday. The sources attributed the delay - it was meant to be presented to parliament on Thursday - to efforts to clean up \u201clegal and technical questions\u201d pending from the institution\u2019s reincarnation as NERIT and \u201cthe economic investigation\u201d the new government had to conduct on Nerit. They explained: \u201cFinding the correct solution to [those issues] is the cause of the postponement of the legal plan which will be brought before [parliament] on Monday.\u201d \u201cERT is opening, workers are returning.\u201d More reaction to the prospect of Greece crawling with part-time tax evasion inspectors, with hidden cameras and microphones: Back to Greece...and the FT has published a letter which (it says) the Greek finance minister has sent to Brussels officials ahead of Monday\u2019s eurogroup. The letter outlines seven reforms including improving tax collection and the public finances, and addressing Greece\u2019s humanitarian crisis. It also suggests that talks should begin on a \u201cpossible follow-up arrangement\u201d. It\u2019s billed as a contract for recovery and growth\u2019, but it\u2019s a third bailout really. Somewhat surprisingly, the letter also proposes that Greece sends an army of \u201cnon-professional inspectors\u201d, secretly carrying audio and video recording kit, across the country to spot tax evasion. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis argues that this would tackle the culture of tax dodgy in Greece. He proposes: That large numbers of non-professional inspectors are hired on a strictly short-term, casual basis (no longer than two months, and without any prospect of being rehired) to post, after some basic trading, as customers, on behalf of the tax authorities, while \u2018wired\u2019 for sound and video. The information they collected would carry legal weight, he argued, and could be acted on by full-time tax officers. \u201cThe very \u2018news\u2019 that thousands of casual \u2018onlookers\u2019 are everywhere, bearing audio and video recording equipment on behalf of tax authorities, has the capacity to shift attitudes very quickly,\u201d The FT\u2019s man in Brussels, Peter Spiegel, got hold of the letter and kindly uploaded it: He\u2019s also uploaded the letter here. What can possibly go wrong?... Here\u2019s my colleague Dominic Rushe on today\u2019s jobs report: The US economy shook off the brutal winter weather in February to add 295,000 new jobs, the 12th straight month it has added over 200,000 jobs, the Bureau of Labour Statistics said Friday. Economists had forecast employers would add 240,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate would fall to 5.6% from January\u2019s 5.7%. The actual figures beat predictions on both scores with the unemployment rate dropping to 5.5%. Over the past year the US economy has added an average of 270,000 jobs each month. Hiring from November through February was the best four-month pace since the late 1990s. In January the US added 257,000 new jobs, the strongest month of growth since. Wage growth, however, remained disappointing. Average hourly earnings rose by 3 cents in February to $24.78. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen by 48 cents, or 2%. The latest jobs news will add pressure for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, which have been close to zero since the recession began. The central bank has said repeatedly that it will be \u201cpatient\u201d in its assessment of when rates will rise but minutes from recent meeting reveal officials are at odds over how long they should wait. \u201cToday\u2019s report is entirely in step with recent trends and, with the unemployment rate now at the top end of longer run estimates, the Fed will almost surely move to drop \u2018patient\u2019 at its upcoming meeting while pushing towards raising interest rates later this year,\u201d said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at broker BTIG. Full story: US economy shrugs off winter weather to add 295,000 jobs in February An interesting note from Jeremy Lawson, chief economist at Standard Life Investments, just landed. He reckons the Federal Reserve has a real dilemma deciding whether to raise rates in June, or hold off until December. While some economic data favours an early hike, others suggest the Fed should be cautious. He writes: A dove would use the following line of reasoning. In recent months there has been a noticeable softening in the non-labour market data. Business investment indicators have softened, as have vehicle sales. That suggests that falling gasoline prices are not yet boosting economic activity. GDP growth was only just above 2% in Q4 and will probably be weaker in Q1. There is not a lot of evidence why that will pick up in Q2. Meanwhile, average hourly earnings growth is still very subdued and the near-term momentum in core PCE inflation has been very weak. With the US dollar continuing to rise on a trade weighted basis, and downside risks to global growth emanating from emerging markets increasing, inflation is unlikely to move up to its 2% target quickly enough to justify tightening policy. Indeed, a premature rate rise would damage the recovery as well as the Fed\u2019s inflation credibility. Recent advocates for this view have been Charles Evans from the Chicago Fed and Eric Rosengren from the Boston Fed, the two most dovish members of the Committee. A centrist would take a different tack. They would point to very strong employment growth and the firm downward trend in unemployment and labour underutilisation. Along with the still high levels of business and consumer sentiment, they would recommend looking through some of the near-term weakness in the hard data, arguing that it was likely to be mainly due to the temporary effects of bad weather, or the fact that in the short-term lower oil prices constrains investment more than it boosts other components of GDP. On the foreign front, they would be mindful of the rise in the dollar, but also observe that growth has been improving in Europe and Japan, underpinned by significant monetary easing..... So what might Fed chair Janet Yellen do? I think that she will find the arguments to remove the patient language compelling. I also suspect that she will be comforted by the strength of the improvement in the labour market, and will not yet be alarmed by the downside surprises to some of the key hard data in recent months. That said, she also takes the inflation side of the Fed\u2019s mandate seriously and will not like the optics of tightening policy at a time when core PCE inflation is declining. She will recognise that the ongoing rise in the dollar means that core goods price inflation will probably weaken further. Thus, while she will want to keep a June increase on the table, she will want to see more evidence that forward looking inflation indicators are moving in the right direction before pulling the trigger. For those reasons, I see June/September (or later) as a genuine 50-50 call. The jobs report hasn\u2019t sparked a stock market rally. Shares are down in New York, with the Dow Jones dropping 90 points or 0.5%. Apple, though, has seen its shares jump by 2% following an announcement that the world\u2019s most valuable company will join the Dow. As the jobs market improves, US companies may have to start hiking wages to retain talent. James Knightley of ING explains: The pool of available labour continues to shrink so firms are finding it increasingly difficult to hire workers with the right skill-set that are currently unemployed. This means that turnover in the labour market will continue to rise with firms increasingly looking to hire staff that are already employed elsewhere. As a result, we suspect firms will increasingly be thinking about staff retention - we are moving from an environment where firms didn\u2019t feel the need to offer higher pay to one where it is a growing requirement to pay more in order to keep staff. And the resulting pressure on inflation means the Fed might hike in June, Knightley suggests. Paul Dales, senior US economist at Capital Economics, agrees that pressure is building on the Federal Reserve. The 295,000 increase in US payrolls in February (consensus 235,000) and the further fall in the unemployment to 5.5% illustrate that, even if wage growth is still subdued, the Fed can\u2019t hang around before raising rates. Could the Fed hike as soon as June? Enrique Diaz, lead currency specialist at business finance group Ebury, reckons they will, which should help pin the euro down. \u201cThis is quite a day for Dollar bulls. These latest figures have more than surpassed the markets\u2019 expectations, sending the Dollar soaring by around 1% against the Euro. This is good news for Eurozone exporters. As for the currency impact, with the ECB introducing further QE this week, it may now be difficult for the Euro to bounce back from its recent slide. More fundamentally, this may well be the green light that the Fed have been waiting for on interest rates. We should see a hike as soon as June this year, and the overnight rate should end the year at around the 1% level.\u201d Bad news for Brits heading across the Atlantic soon -- the pound has fallen by one and a half cents against the US dollar, to just $1.5095. Sebastien Galy of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says: The US labour market is tightening much faster than expected but without much signs of wage growth. Irrespective of this the big repricing of the Fed\u2019s reaction function is on the way, sooner maybe a tad faster as the Fed catches up This chart shows how \u201cthe markets\u201d now expect US borrowing costs to be a little higher over the next three years: This is encouraging. The underemployment rate (which measures how many Americans would like to work more hours) fell to 11% in February. That\u2019s a healthy drop from January\u2019s 11.3% -- but still too high. The labour force participation rate (which measures how many Americans of working age are actually available for work) dipped last month to 62.8%. That\u2019s a bad sign, argues Dab Alpert, managing partner of New York investment bank Westwood Capital: The main job creation last month was in food services, bars, professional and business services, construction, health care, and in transportation and warehousing, says the BLS. Other commentators are convinced that the US labor market is healing: Reaction is coming in....and some economists are disappointed that wage growth remains weak. The meagre 0.1% increase in average hourly earnings last month means that they rose by just 2.0% year-on-year. That means worker are still not experiencing the recovery in their wallets and purses. Money is flowing out of US government debt, pushing up the yield (or interest rate) on Treasury bills. That\u2019s another sign that investors are expecting the Federal Reserve to start to tighten monetary policy this year, perhaps as early as the summer? The BLS has revised down January and December\u2019s data, to show that 18,000 fewer jobs were created than expected. But even so, last month\u2019s strong report isn\u2019t a blip. America has posted decent jobs growth in three of the last four months: The jobs report is fuelling predictions that the Federal Reserve will start to raise interest rates this year. The dollar is surging on the back of the jobs report, driving the euro down to a new 11 and a half-year low. One euro is worth just $1.0877, the lowest since autumn 2003. Here\u2019s the official details: However... average earnings are a little disappointing. Earnings rose by just 0.1% last month, weaker than the 0.2% rise that was forecast. At 5.5%, the US unemployment rate is now at its lowest in over six years. The results are in! The US economy economy created 295,000 new jobs last month, a rather stronger reading than expected. The unemployment rate has fallen too, to 5.5% -- from 5.7% last month. Lots more detail and reaction to come.... The Bureau of Labor Statistics website has crashed... Here we go.... The Wall Street Journal has some good charts showing how America\u2019s employment market added jobs steadily over the last year... ...although wage growth has been elusive: More in the WSJ\u2019s preview: Five Things to Watch in February\u2019s Jobs Report The jobs report should be published on the Department of Labor\u2019s website, and also on the Bureau of Labor Statistics site. US policymakers will also be scrutinising today\u2019s jobs report for signs that \u2018labour market slack\u2019 is being used up. How do you tell that? By measuring how many people aren\u2019t working as much as they\u2019d like. Bloomberg explains: The so-called U-6 or \u201cunderemployment\u201d rate edged up to 11.3 percent in January \u2014 still a blemish for the economy if you consider that the measure averaged 8.8 percent in the four years leading up to the last recession. This gauge includes workers such as those in part-time roles who would take full-time gigs. Against the unemployment rate with which we are all familiar, called the U-3 rate, you can see why policy makers are eager for evidence that underemployment is receding more quickly: Over to a snowy Washington now, for the final economic news of the week \u2013 the US Jobs Report. The Non-Farm Payroll for February will be released in 30 minutes time, giving a new insight into the health of the world\u2019s largest economy. It will show how many new jobs were created last month and \u2013 arguably more importantly - whether Americans were paid more. Here are the economist predictions (from city broker Abshire-Smith\u2019s preview) 1) an increase of 240,000 new jobs compared to January\u2019s 257,000. With the economy rebounding 2) A fall in the unemployment rate to 5.6% from 5.7%, 3) a small rise in average hourly earnings (+0.25). The report is due at 1.30pm GMT, or 8.30am EST. However, because of the bad weather in America, it could be slightly delayed. The Labor Department has said it will make every effort to put the data on its website at 8:30 a.m. or shortly afterwards...... A very quick recap: The euro has hit its lowest level against the US dollar in over 11 years, and hit a seven year low against the pound, ahead of the launch of the eurozone\u2019s QE package on Monday. Here are the key charts Eurozone government bond yields also fell to fresh record lows, following yesterday\u2019s confirmation that the European Central Bank will launch its \u20ac1trn asset-purchase scheme next week. QE also drove the Japanese stock market to a new 15-year high today, although European markets are more subdued. Greece prime minister has claimed that the ECB still has a rope around Greece\u2019s neck. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government has also denied falling out with Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker; the pair are still planning to meet soon to discuss Greece\u2019s humanitarian crisis. Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s habit of shooting from the lip is a godsend to the media, but it hasn\u2019t helped Athens build relationships in Brussels. That\u2019s one of the lessons that the Open Europe thinktank has drawn from the new Syriza government\u2019s early weeks. OE director Mats Persson reckons Britain\u2019s Conservative party should should take note: Mind your language: Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis may be fun, but his controversial running commentary \u2013 \u201cfiscal waterboarding\u201d, \u201cbankrupt country\u201d etc \u2013 has meant the new Greek government has used up a lot of political capital with EU partners for zero diplomatic benefit. The Tories are slowly learning this lesson (for example by not singling out individual countries when discussing immigration). Don\u2019t negotiate via the media: Syriza \u2013 like Number 10 up until recently \u2013 has a tendency to write the headline first, and the content later. I can think of no example when this has actually worked in terms of winning concessions in Europe. First get a sensible policy that squares your democratic mandate and its negotiability in Europe (admittedly a hard thing to pull off) , then go to the media Here\u2019s the full list: Eight lessons for David Cameron from Syriza Reuters has now filed a story on Tsipras\u2019s interview with Der Spiegel: Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras wants to issue short-term debt such as Treasury bills to plug his government\u2019s financing gap and warned in a German magazine that if the European Central Bank objected, it would be assuming a grave responsibility. \u201cThen it will be back to the thriller we saw before Feb. 20,\u201d he told Der Spiegel, referring to the date Greece agreed a four-month bailout extension with its euro zone partners. \u201cThe ECB has still got a rope round our neck,\u201d Tsipras said, according to excerpts of the interview released on Friday. The leftist prime minister said he did not want Greece to leave the euro \u201cbecause I love Europe\u201d and said he had asked all his cabinet ministers - not just his combative finance minister Yanis Varoufakis - for \u201cfewer words and more deeds\u201d.  Personally, I\u2019d be delighted with more words and deeds from Varoufakis. Hat-tip to Jeremy Cook of World First for this chart, showing how much the euro has weakened since the ECB imposed negative interest rates on commercial banks nine months ago: \u201cLess talk, more action\u201d. That\u2019s the Greek prime minister\u2019s message to his ministers, including the never knowingly underquoted finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. Alexis Tsipras made the comments to German news magazine Spiegel. Reuters has just snapped the key points, including another denial that Greece could leave the eurozone. BERLIN-GREEK PM TSIPRAS TELLS GERMAN MAGAZINE HE WANTS TO ISSUE SHORT-TERM DEBT TO COVER FINANCING DEFICIT TSIPRAS TELLS SPIEGEL MAGAZINE THAT IF ECB DOESN\u2019T AGREE TO THIS, THEY ARE ASSUMING GREAT RESPONSIBILITY TSIPRAS SAYS RULES OUT GREEK EXIT FROM EURO \u201cBECAUSE I LOVE EUROPE\u201d TSIPRAS SAYS HAS ASKED GREEK MINISTERS FOR FEWER WORDS, MORE ACTION, INCLUDING FIN MIN VAROUFAKIS TSIPRAS SAYS ECB STILL HAS \u201cROPE ROUND OUR NECK\u201d Varoufakis, meanwhile, continues to wow the media, appearing on the front cover of Esquire magazine (\u20ac13.80 (!) at all good Greek newsagents) Brussels is also denying there is a rift with Athens: Correction! Monday night\u2019s eurogroup meeting might not be a marathon after all: Over in Athens, prime ministerial aides have denied that European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has rejected a request to speak with Alexis Tsipras [as Suddeutsche Zeitung claims today]. Helena Smith, our correspondent in Athens, says put on the defensive officials have just issued another tersely worded statement. She writes: Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 aides were adamant: the Greek leader had neither made a request for a meeting with the European Commission chief before Monday\u2019s Euro group, nor was there any let-up in communication between the two men. A statement issued by Tsipras\u2019 office in the last half hour declared: \u201cNo meeting with Mr Juncker was requested before Monday\u2019s Eurogroup. The prime minister speaks with Mr Juncker regularly. Their last contact was yesterday, Thursday, during which they agreed to meet before the Summit meeting.\u201d They admitted, however, that talks were underway to discuss how European Union funds could be used to finance the leftist-led government\u2019s plans to alleviate both joblessness and the humanitarian crisis, the by-products of six years of recession and austerity. \u201cAt their meeting, which will take place in the coming days, they will discuss how Greece can productively make use of European funds to combat the humanitarian crisis and unemployment.\u201d Insiders in the governing Syriza party are also firmly denying that the government will have an \u201cissue\u201d paying public salaries or pensions this month. So, Greece has sent a new letter to Brussels with details of its reform plans, but it didn\u2019t arrive in time for Wednesday\u2019s working group (where officials do the hard graft ahead of Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting) Eurostat has just confirmed that the eurozone economy grew by 0.3% in the last three months of 2014, in line with the initial estimate. Encouragingly, consumer spending, business investment and trade all added to GDP growth, while government spending was flat. again. The wider EU grew by 0.4%, with the fastest growth in Estonia and Sweden (both +1.1%). Germany grew by 0.7%, while France only managed 0.1% and Italy stagnated Four countries contracted: Cyprus (-0.7%), Greece (-0.4%), Austria and Finland (both -0.2%). Over in Brussels, an official is briefing the press now ahead of Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel is tweeting the key points:  The meeting between Greece\u2019s prime minister and its central bank governor is over. Bank chief Yannis Stournaras spoke to the media afterwards, and said that it is \u201cvery important\u201d that Monday night\u2019s eurogroup meeting is a success. He also pledged that Greek bank deposits are safe [yesterday, the ECB extended another \u20ac500m of emergency liquidity support to the sector] Back in Britain, the public\u2019s inflation expectations have hit a 13-year low. Citizens expect prices to rise by 1.9% over the next year, the lowest since late 2001, a new Bank of England survey found. [reminder, UK inflation is currently just 0.3%] And just 36% expect interest rates to rise in the next year, down from 37% in the previous survey in November. These charts underline how the euro has weakened against other major currencies in recent weeks, hitting new lows this morning. The euro has just weakened to a new eleven and a half-year low against the US dollar. Foreign exchange traders drove the single currency down to its lowest level since September 2003, as they prepare for the European Central Bank to unleash its trillion-euro bond-buying programme on Monday. The euro has fallen 0.5% this morning against the US dollar, to hit $1.0974. It\u2019s also hit a new seven year low against sterling. One pound is now worth \u20ac1.385, which I think is the most since December 2007. The prospect of Eurozone QE has weakened the euro steadily this year, even though the ECB hasn\u2019t actually bought anything yet. As explained earlier, the ECB is planning to buy \u20ac60bn of assets -- including government debt -- each month until September 2016. Many of those bonds will be bought from banks outside the eurozone. That will effectively weaken the euro, as those foreign banks will be handed euros which they may then exchange for local currency, or US dollars, to buy new assets. Chris Weston of IG explains: With the ECB buying more bonds than are being issued, this is a huge negative for the euro. All roads at present lead to a weaker euro and an outperforming equity market. And as flagged up earlier, some eurozone bond yields are hitting record lows today -- meaning prices are at all-time highs. Newsflash from Reuters: Greece has met a loan repayment to the International Monetary Fund this morning. GREECE PAYS FIRST INSTALLMENT OF 310 MLN EUROS DUE FRIDAY AS PART OF IMF MARCH LOAN REPAYMENT-GOVT SOURCE That\u2019s the first of four debt demands this month: Greece is unlikely to trigger a systemic crisis if it defaults on its debt and leave the eurozone, rating agency Fitch says today. In a new report, Fitch warns that the threat of Grexit hasn\u2019t abated, despite the four-month bailout extension agreed last month. The uncompromising stance taken by both sides at times before the agreement highlights the possibility of a future policy mistake. \u201cGrexit\u201d is not our base case, but will remain a risk as more detailed negotiations take place, and as the Greek government tries to maintain domestic support for the deal it secures. But, unlike in 2012, the eurozone is better equipped to cope. The eurozone has developed mechanisms to prevent a run on a sovereign leading to a sovereign default, and to alleviate sovereign-to-sovereign contagion, and concerns about other eurozone sovereigns\u2019 creditworthiness are less pronounced than in 2012. A chain reaction from Grexit to the ultimate breakup of the bloc is therefore unlikely... More here: \u2018Grexit\u2019 Remains Possible, But Systemic Crisis Unlikely German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung claims that European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has rejected a request to speak with Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras today. According to Suddeutsche, Tsipras hoped to discuss Greece\u2019s funding problems with Junker; but the EC president wants to wait until Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting. This follows reports that Athens will struggle to meet public sector salary demands. We\u2019ll see if we can get more details on this. In the meantime, here\u2019s the story: Tsipras bittet Juncker um Hilfe And here\u2019s MNI newswire\u2019s take: In the City, shares in holiday firm Thomas Cook have jumped by 16% after it announced a tie-up with a Chinese investor. Fosun International has taken a 5% stake in the venerable UK travel maker (founded back in 1841), and hopes to expand that to 10%. The deal should help develop China\u2019s burgeoning holiday sector, as the growing middle classes look to travel abroad. Full story: Thomas Cook stake sold to China conglomerate Spain\u2019s factory sector also performed well in January, posting a 0.4% rise in output. Economists had expected a 0.3% decline - perhaps the weak euro is providing eurozone firms a much-needed boost. Germany\u2019s industrial heartland began 2015 quite strongly, new data shows, as its economic recovery continued to pick up. German industrial production rose by 0.6% in January, ahead of forecasts. December\u2019s figure was revised sharply higher too, to +1.0%. The QE effect is also pushing up the value of debt issued by Spain, Portugal and Italy to record highs. This is pushing down the yield (interest rate) on all three country\u2019s debts to new lows, as investors anticipate the arrival of the ECB\u2019s stimulus programme. Importantly, the ECB said yesterday it would buy debt even if was trading at a slight negative yield -- ie, more than its face value. That will help Mario Draghi to pump money into the banking sector (as he\u2019ll have a wider selection of bonds to buy). IG\u2019s Chris Weston explains: The fact the bank is prepared to buy bonds with yields as low as negative 20 basis points increases its scope (or the actual ability) to buy \u20ac60 billion a month in assets, especially as 32% of all outstanding bonds have a negative yield now. The news that the eurozone is, finally, joining the quantitative easing party has helped to drive shares in Japan to a 15-year high. The Nikkei jumped 1.2% or 291 points to 18,971, the best closing level since April 2000. That follows a rally in Europe yesterday, after Mario Draghi announced that the ECB\u2019s bond-buying programme will start on March 09, and also predicted stronger growth this year. Ian Williams of Peel Hunt explains that Draghi\u2019s upbeat mood is helping to drive shares higher. The ECB announcement did not contain anything that should have surprised investors, but with the mood still extremely equity friendly, it triggered another rally for Eurozone indices. The Nikkei has now risen for four weeks running; pushed up by expectations that central banks will maintain their loose monetary policy for some time. Traders say today\u2019s rally was also due to the yen dropping against the US dollar; America\u2019s currency is strengthening ahead of this afternoon\u2019s unemployment report. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. America\u2019s labour market recovery puts Europe to shame. And we\u2019ll get another reminder of that today, with the latest Non-Farm Payroll report (at 1.30pm GMT). February\u2019s NFP is expected to show that US employers hired around 240,000 new staff last month. That could pull the unemployment rate down to 5.6%, from 5.7% -- or or around half of the eurozone\u2019s 11.2%. If the wage data is strong, it could reignite talk of a US interest rate hike. We\u2019ll also be monitoring reaction to yesterday\u2019s European Central Bank meeting, where Mario Draghi confirmed that QE will begin on Monday. The euro has hit a new 12-year low overnight, briefly dipping below the $1.1 mark. Is parity with the dollar coming? And Greece\u2019s debt woes haven\u2019t gone away; Athens should be working on firm proposals for next Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is due to meet with central bank governor Yannis Stournaras shortly: I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

The government introduced lessons about taxation into the secondary school system, the armed forces and other institutions; it also flooded the country with pamphlets and advertising, and offered tours of tax offices.</p> <p>The government sought to convey the sense that taxation wasn\u2019t an evil to be avoided, but the price of citizenship. It even built a museum of taxation (it so impressed U.S. officials that the Internal Revenue Service built one, too).

While some economic data favours an early hike, others suggest the Fed should be cautious.</p> <p>He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A dove would use the following line of reasoning. In recent months there has been a noticeable softening in the non-labour market data. Business investment indicators have softened, as have vehicle sales. That suggests that falling gasoline prices are not yet boosting economic activity. GDP growth was only just above 2% in Q4 and will probably be weaker in Q1. There is not a lot of evidence why that will pick up in Q2. Meanwhile, average hourly earnings growth is still very subdued and the near-term momentum in core PCE inflation has been very weak. With the US dollar continuing to rise on a trade weighted basis, and downside risks to global growth emanating from emerging markets increasing, inflation is unlikely to move up to its 2% target quickly enough to justify tightening policy. Indeed, a premature rate rise would damage the recovery as well as the Fed\u2019s inflation credibility. Recent advocates for this view have been Charles Evans from the Chicago Fed and Eric Rosengren from the Boston Fed, the two most dovish members of the Committee.</p> <p>A centrist would take a different tack. They would point to very strong employment growth and the firm downward trend in unemployment and labour underutilisation. Along with the still high levels of business and consumer sentiment, they would recommend looking through some of the near-term weakness in the hard data, arguing that it was likely to be mainly due to the temporary effects of bad weather, or the fact that in the short-term lower oil prices constrains investment more than it boosts other components of GDP. On the foreign front, they would be mindful of the rise in the dollar, but also observe that growth has been improving in Europe and Japan, underpinned by significant monetary easing.....</p> </blockquote> <p>So what might Fed chair Janet Yellen do?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I think that she will find the arguments to remove the patient language compelling. I also suspect that she will be comforted by the strength of the improvement in the labour market, and will not yet be alarmed by the downside surprises to some of the key hard data in recent months. That said, she also takes the inflation side of the Fed\u2019s mandate seriously and will not like the optics of tightening policy at a time when core PCE inflation is declining. She will recognise that the ongoing rise in the dollar means that core goods price inflation will probably weaken further. Thus, while she will want to keep a June increase on the table, she will want to see more evidence that forward looking inflation indicators are moving in the right direction before pulling the trigger. For those reasons, I see June/September (or later) as a genuine 50-50 call. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54f9c3efe4b06bb68004d3ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-03-06T15:15:31.241Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The jobs report hasn\u2019t sparked a stock market rally.</strong></p> <p>Shares are down in New York, with the Dow Jones dropping 90 points or 0.5%.</p> <p>Apple, though, has seen its shares jump by 2% following an announcement that the world\u2019s most valuable company will join the Dow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/statuses/573861705131933696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash\">#Apple</a> jumps as company set to Join the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average <a href=\"http://t.co/nR0mEZGJJl\">http://t.co/nR0mEZGJJl</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/3IKrhhc8Ch\">pic.twitter.com/3IKrhhc8Ch</a></p>&mdash; Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/573861705131933696\">March 6, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54f9bb84e4b06bb68004d39e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-03-06T14:51:11.813Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>As the jobs market improves, US companies may have to start hiking wages to retain talent.</strong></p> <p>James Knightley of ING explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pool of available labour continues to shrink so firms are finding it increasingly difficult to hire workers with the right skill-set that are currently unemployed. </p> <p>This means that turnover in the labour market will continue to rise with firms increasingly looking to hire staff that are already employed elsewhere.

      "bodyText": "The pound has hit a seven-year high against the euro, bringing cheer for British holidaymakers but underscoring fears about the fragile European single currency as markets prepare for a flood of emergency electronic cash. The euro sank to \u20ac1.387 against the pound and also sold off sharply against the dollar before next week\u2019s launch of a \u20ac1.1tn stimulus programme in the eurozone. The European Central Bank is to start pumping \u20ac60bn a month into the euro economy as the first phase in its quantitative easing programme. The scheme is intended to help get the eurozone back on the path to sustained growth. But, while the ECB gets ready to fire the starting gun on a massive support package,the US Federal Reserve looks to be gearing up for a move in the opposite direction on the other side of the Atlantic. A US interest rate increase looked more likely on Friday after upbeat news on the jobs market. Government figures showed the world\u2019s largest economy added 295,000 jobs last month, up from 239,000 in January and much better than expected. That helped the US unemployment rate drop to 5.5%, its lowest for more than six and a half years. Some traders believe US borrowing costs could rise as soon as June from near zero. Paul Dales, senior US economist at the thinktank Capital Economics, said the latest report certainly raised pressure on the Federal Reserve. \u201cEven if wage growth is still subdued, the Fed can\u2019t hang around before raising rates,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Fed waits until wage growth rises, it will be well behind the curve and will have to raise rates much more aggressively at a later stage.\u201d The backdrop of diverging central bank policy made for sharp moves on currency markets. The dollar soared as traders mulled the prospect of near-term tightening in the US, imminent loosening in the eurozone and no change in the UK\u2019s record low interest rates. The US currency was at its highest for more than 11 years against the embattled euro, with one euro now worth just $1.0845 - down almost two cents on the day. Some traders predict the two currencies being worth the same, or reaching parity, in coming weeks. There were several factors keeping the euro under pressure, said Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at foreign exchange company Monex Europe. \u201cThe fall in the euro over the last couple of weeks has been nothing short of a collapse, with both the euro-dollar exchange rate and euro-pound exchange rate plumbing multiyear lows. A powerful confluence of factors has contributed to the euro\u2019s demise \u2013 monetary easing from the ECB, political uncertainty and a rampant US dollar that has laid the euro\u2019s weaknesses bare,\u201d he said. The pound also lost ground against the US dollar. After the strong US jobs report, sterling hit a four-week low of about $1.508, having lost more than 2% over the week against the dollar. Traders also cited uncertainty about May\u2019s general election as weighing on the pound.",

The scheme is intended to help get the eurozone back on the path to sustained growth.</p> <p>But, while the ECB gets ready to fire the starting gun on a massive support package,the US Federal Reserve looks to be gearing up for a move in the opposite direction on the other side of the Atlantic. A US interest rate increase looked more likely on Friday after upbeat news on the jobs market. </p> <p>Government figures showed the world\u2019s largest economy added 295,000 jobs last month, up from 239,000 in January and much better than expected. That helped the US unemployment rate drop to 5.5%, its lowest for more than six and a half years.</p> <p>Some traders believe US borrowing costs could rise as soon as June from near zero.</p> <p>Paul Dales, senior US economist at the thinktank Capital Economics, said the latest report certainly raised pressure on the Federal Reserve. \u201cEven if wage growth is still subdued, the Fed can\u2019t hang around before raising rates,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Fed waits until wage growth rises, it will be well behind the curve and will have to raise rates much more aggressively at a later stage.\u201d</p> <p>The backdrop of diverging central bank policy made for sharp moves on currency markets. The dollar soared as traders mulled the prospect of near-term tightening in the US, imminent loosening in the eurozone and no change in the UK\u2019s record low interest rates.</p> <p>The US currency was at its highest for more than 11 years against the embattled euro, with one euro now worth just $1.0845 - down almost two cents on the day. Some traders predict the two currencies being worth the same, or reaching parity, in coming weeks.</p> <p>There were several factors keeping the euro under pressure, said Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at foreign exchange company Monex Europe. \u201cThe fall in the euro over the last couple of weeks has been nothing short of a collapse, with both the euro-dollar exchange rate and euro-pound exchange rate plumbing multiyear lows. A powerful confluence of factors has contributed to the euro\u2019s demise \u2013 monetary easing from the ECB, political uncertainty and a rampant US dollar that has laid the euro\u2019s weaknesses bare,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The pound also lost ground against the US dollar. After the strong US jobs report, sterling hit a four-week low of about $1.508, having lost more than 2% over the week against the dollar. Traders also cited uncertainty about May\u2019s general election as weighing on the pound. </p>",

None of the 79% stake has yet to been sold off although George Osborne has promised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/05/george-osborne-sell-government-stake-rbs-quickly-election\">to sell it as \u201cquickly as we can\u201d</a> if he remains chancellor after the 7 May election.</p> <p>Chief executive Ross McEwan was paid \u00a31.8m in salary, pension and benefits in 2014 and was handed \u00a31.5m in shares to buy him out of his previous employer in Australia when he was recruited to run the retail bank. He was awarded \u00a31.5m of shares under a long-term plan that will pay out in the future. The pay of the New Zealander, though, was eclipsed by a number of colleagues.</p> <p> The newly recruited finance director Ewen Stevenson received \u00a33.1m after being bought out of his previous employer, Credit Suisse, and Rory Cullinan, who runs the non-core division of the bank, received \u00a32.2m from bonuses handed out in previous years. Cullinan, who has been promoted to help wind down the investment banking arm, cashed in \u00a31.2m of shares and was awarded \u00a32m in a new pay deal. </p> <p>The bank published share payouts and awarded to the members of the executive management team who do not sit on the board. When share awards to McEwan and Stevenson are included, eight senior managers were awarded shares worth \u00a311m which will payout in the future. In total more than \u00a35m of shares were cashed in from previous years.<br></p> <p>The bank said the 128 paid more than \u20ac1m compares with 149 a year ago when the staff who have relocated to the US through its Citizens Financial arm, in the process of being floated in the US stock market, are included. </p> <p>The pay disclosures detail \u00a3858,847 of shares that were handed to Stephen Hester, whom McEwan replaced in September 2013, in March 2014 under the terms of his departure package. Next week Hester stands to receive 785,995 shares - potentially worth \u00a33m - although his colleagues were handed 61% when performance criteria were applied. It is not clear whether Hester or any of his former top management colleagues have any of their pay withheld as a result of the on-going review by the bank into the events that led to its fines foreign exchange rigging when it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/12/foreign-exchange-fines-ubs-hsbc-citibank-jp-morgan-rbs-penalties-market-rigging\">was part of a \u00a32.6bn settlement</a>. <br></p> <p>But Sir Sandy Crombie, the non-executive director who chairs the remuneration committee, said that the overall bonus pool of \u00a3421m - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/26/rbs-paid-out-421m-in-bonuses-in-2014-royal-bank-scotland\">announced last week</a> - had been reduced to cover the rigging of foreign exchange markets and as well as the IT meltdown in 2012 for which the bank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/20/royal-bank-of-scotland-it-breakdown-56m-pounds-fine\">was fined \u00a356m last year</a>.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland paid 128 of its top bankers more than \u20ac1m (\u00a3720,000) in 2014, a year when it reported its seventh consecutive year of losses since being bailed out by the taxpayer and was punished by regulators for rigging foreign exchange markets. Three bankers, whose identities are protected because only the pay deals of boardroom directors have to be published, received up to \u20ac6m. The disclosures are likely to reignite the controversy over the pay handed out by the bank, which has incurred losses on a par with the \u00a345bn ploughed in by taxpayers to prevent it going bust. None of the 79% stake has yet to been sold off although George Osborne has promised to sell it as \u201cquickly as we can\u201d if he remains chancellor after the 7 May election. Chief executive Ross McEwan was paid \u00a31.8m in salary, pension and benefits in 2014 and was handed \u00a31.5m in shares to buy him out of his previous employer in Australia when he was recruited to run the retail bank. He was awarded \u00a31.5m of shares under a long-term plan that will pay out in the future. The pay of the New Zealander, though, was eclipsed by a number of colleagues. The newly recruited finance director Ewen Stevenson received \u00a33.1m after being bought out of his previous employer, Credit Suisse, and Rory Cullinan, who runs the non-core division of the bank, received \u00a32.2m from bonuses handed out in previous years. Cullinan, who has been promoted to help wind down the investment banking arm, cashed in \u00a31.2m of shares and was awarded \u00a32m in a new pay deal. The bank published share payouts and awarded to the members of the executive management team who do not sit on the board. When share awards to McEwan and Stevenson are included, eight senior managers were awarded shares worth \u00a311m which will payout in the future. In total more than \u00a35m of shares were cashed in from previous years. The bank said the 128 paid more than \u20ac1m compares with 149 a year ago when the staff who have relocated to the US through its Citizens Financial arm, in the process of being floated in the US stock market, are included. The pay disclosures detail \u00a3858,847 of shares that were handed to Stephen Hester, whom McEwan replaced in September 2013, in March 2014 under the terms of his departure package. Next week Hester stands to receive 785,995 shares - potentially worth \u00a33m - although his colleagues were handed 61% when performance criteria were applied. It is not clear whether Hester or any of his former top management colleagues have any of their pay withheld as a result of the on-going review by the bank into the events that led to its fines foreign exchange rigging when it was part of a \u00a32.6bn settlement. But Sir Sandy Crombie, the non-executive director who chairs the remuneration committee, said that the overall bonus pool of \u00a3421m - announced last week - had been reduced to cover the rigging of foreign exchange markets and as well as the IT meltdown in 2012 for which the bank was fined \u00a356m last year. Some \u00a3588m had been paid out in bonuses the year before. Some pay had also been clawed back. \u201cMalus has been applied as part of our accountability review process,\u201d said Crombie. Analysts at Macquarie said, after digesting its latest results showing a \u00a33.5bn loss, said: \u201cRBS has now delivered seven consistent loss making years (is that a record?) losing a cumulative \u00a350bn (equal to \u00a32,700 per UK household). And yet despite that, management still indicates a further \u00a36.25bn-\u00a37.25bn in required restructuring charges and believes that we are five years from the promised land. We are all in favour of long-term investing, but this is getting absurd\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Billionaire Mike Ashley has told a committee of MPs he is too busy for the entire month of March to appear before them to answer questions about 200 job losses at a retailer owned by his Sports Direct chain and his firm\u2019s use of controversial zero hours contracts. His advisers have spent more than a month blocking repeated attempts by Scottish MPs to call him to face questions, according to newly released correspondence. Ashley\u2019s lawyers said he was unavailable to appear before the committee during March but declined to comply with the MPs\u2019 requests to set out the commitments he has which are preventing him appearing before parliament is dissolved on the last day of the month. The Scottish affairs committee wants him to explain the treatment of staff at the company\u2019s USC business in Scotland and the retailer\u2019s use of zero-hours contracts. As many as 90% of the retailer\u2019s 23,000 staff are employed under the arrangement, which does not guarantee work.The committee has asked staff to come forward to discuss the impact of the contracts. About 200 staff lost their jobs at USC\u2019s Ayrshire warehouse when administrators were called in to West Coast Capital (USC) \u2013 the Sports Direct-controlled entity that owned 28 USC stores. The stores were immediately bought out of administration by another part of Sports Direct, but the warehouse was closed down. A spokesman for the committee said on Tuesday that Sports Direct\u2019s chief executive, David Forsey, would be appearing, rather than the retailer\u2019s founder and majority owner.

    "webTitle": "Fewer women leading FTSE firms than men called John", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There are far more men called John leading the UK\u2019s biggest companies than women, according to a Guardian namecheck of the FTSE 100 that shows the starkness of the gender divide at the top of the corporate world. Among chief executives and chairs of FTSE 100 companies, there are 17 men called John (or Jean) - outnumbering all the female bosses put together. Men called David or Dave also outnumber women, by 2:1. By contrast, the number of women women at the top of British companies can be counted on two hands: a grand total of seven. V\u00e9ronique Laury became chief executive of Kingfisher in January, joining a select group of CEOs that includes Liv Garfield at Severn Trent, Moya Greene at Royal Mail, Alison Cooper at Imperial Tobacco and Carolyn McCall at Easyjet. Only two women occupy the role of company chair - Dame Alison Carnwath at Land Securities and Susan Kilsby at pharmaceutical group Shire. Female leaders of FTSE 100 companies are outnumbered by Davids, Ians, Marks or Andrews (or variations of those names) by nearly 5:1. The corporate clout of Johns is mirrored across the other side of the Atlantic, where the New York Times found more men called John than women running the biggest companies in the US. Their study was inspired by a recent Ernst &amp; Young report, which showed that for every one women on the board of American companies, there were 1.03 Jameses, Roberts, Johns and Williams. In Australia, however, Peters are in the lead. More men with that name hold the chief executive and chair positions of companies in the ASX200 \u2013 Australia\u2019s 200 largest listed companies \u2013 than women. The Guardian\u2019s survey of the FTSE 100 reveals a particularly British twist: there are more men with knighthoods leading British companies than women. A total of 19 company chairmen and chief executives use the title \u2018Sir\u2019, nearly three times as many as women of any rank. Almost 23% of boardroom roles are now filled by women, up from 12.5% in 2010, following a government-backed campaign urging companies to ensure at least 25% of their top team is female. But most are non-executive, part-time directors. Smashing the glass ceiling for chief executive and chair jobs is proving to be harder: only 3.5% of these roles are occupied by women. The prevalence of Johns and Davids is not just a feature of the corporate world. Out of 650 MPs, 23% are women, nearly 5% are called David or Dave and 3.5% are named John. The Conservative party, boasts 17 Davids, including its leader David Cameron, compared to 48 women. On the Labour benches, there are 86 women and 10 Davids/Daves, while the Liberal Democrats have seven women and three Davids. Heather Jackson, founder of An Inspirational Journey, an organisation that advises companies on getting more women into senior roles, said putting the spotlight on the FTSE 100 highlighted the problem of gender imbalance in a simple way. \u201cPut like that it summarises how far we have to go to get more female CEOs at the top.\u201d She said it takes \u201ca good twenty years to get a good CEO in place, developing them from middle management\u201d. But, she added, too many companies were cutting back on programmes and training aimed at improving gender balance at the top. \u201cThe systems and processes are in place, but it is the desire to implement that is going wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are talking about it rather than walking it.\u201d",

She added that with UK inflation so low - currently just 0.3% - Alliance Trust believed interest rates would stay lower for longer, suggesting the Bank of England might delay the first hike until as late as 2017. \u201cCommentators have been predicting that interest rates in the UK will rise \u2018next year\u2019 for at least the last two years, there is a high probability that they will be using the same words this time next year,\u201d she said. Alliance Trust is also balancing the various risks posed by developments abroad. \u201cThe investment team will position the portfolio to take account of any market volatility resulting from economic and geo-political developments relating to the euro, the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East,\u201d said Garrett-Cox. She made the comments as Alliance Trust announced results for 2014. Assets under management totalled \u00a31.9bn at the end of the year, generating net inflows of \u00a388m and reducing losses by 23% to \u00a33.2m. The total dividend for 2014 - including a special dividend of 2.546p - rose by 14.3% to 12.38p a share.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Farmers who undertake good environmental management could be rewarded with lower interest rates under a policy being considered by Australia\u2019s biggest rural lender, the National Australia Bank. The NAB is currently reviewing best environmental practice in industries and regions to determine a formula for lending which is expected to be implemented over the next three to five years. It comes after the bank became one of the first to sign the United Nations Natural Capital Declaration, which holds signatory financial institutions to integrate natural capital assessments into their loans. The declaration also calls on governments to use penalties or \u201cenforceable fiscal measures to discourage business from eroding natural capital\u201d. Signatories include Rabobank and Standard Chartered. Natural capital is defined through the declaration as \u201cnatural assets (soil, air, water, flora and fauna), and the ecosystem services resulting from them, which make human life possible\u201d. Sacha Courville, head of corporate responsibility strategy for NAB, said a survey of 5,000 rural clients showed almost three-quarters were changing their businesses as a result of sustainability concerns such as water scarcity or soil health. \u201cThe goal is to price natural capital risk appropriately,\u201d said Courville. \u201cCustomers managing well would be a lower risk and all things being equal \u2026 could translate into a lower interest rate. Our customers are already ahead of us on this as the survey showed.\u201d The bank added: \u201cThis is not about penalising customers. As our solar product demonstrates, lower interest rates is one potential outcome from our Natural Value strategy. But, we\u2019re only at the beginning of this process.\u201d Courville told Guardian Australia the bank was in the process of defining sustainable practice for particular industries and regions through discussions with industry bodies and their customers. \u201cWe\u2019re also starting to engage in conversations with our customers about the risks and opportunities that natural value considerations pose for them, and how we may be able to support them in taking advantage of opportunities as they arise,\u201d Courville said. Brent Finlay of the National Farmers Federation said he supported a financial approach which factored in environmental practices when assessing loan values but called for a transparent approach which allowed farmers to understand how they would be assessed. \u201cWe are environmental managers already because if you are not looking after property, not only will you see it in the paddock but also in the financials,\u201d said Finlay. \u201cObviously banks assess on a case by case basis and everyone is not the same margin. Most landholders talk to their banks. \u201cAny approach should be based on a sound way of measuring sustainability. Simplistic indicators may not necessarily reflect good environmental outcomes that are being achieved on farm.\u201d Charlie Wood, campaigns director of 350.org, welcomed NAB\u2019s move to include natural capital management when assessing loans but said Australia\u2019s big four banks should move further by withdrawing loans for fossil fuel projects, particularly the $16.5bn Adani coal mine in Queensland. Australian bank finance for Adani has yet to be announced. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see this is in place as part of a thrust to internally assess the external (environmental) cost of projects \u2013 it\u2019s a really good thing,\u201d Wood said. \u201cBut I am concerned about the time frame. Globally emissions will peak yet NAB is still lending to fossil fuel. The big four banks have loaned $20bn to fossil fuels since 2008.\u201d Courville said NAB\u2019s exposure to mining was \u201cquite small\u201d compared with agribusiness and the bank was looking at the natural capital policy as \u201ca commercial decision as much as an environmental decision\u201d. She said the NAB policy was starting with the agricultural industry because of its most obvious links to the environment but would eventually move into other lending areas. \u201cWe understand people on the land see changes going on quicker than others do. Natural capital issues are economic issues, we need to understand energy risk and have good sustainable interests,\u201d Courville said. Since the bank signed the declaration, she said it had developed discounted loan products for renewable energy for landholders such as low-interest solar finance loans to encourage farmers into renewable energy. The bank is also seeking feedback and sentiment from the agribusiness community on land usage issues such as mining and coal seam gas. \u201cWe are monitoring the sentiment of agribusiness community and take that into account when lending as mining, including coal seam gas, are sensitive industries and require an increased level of due diligence.\u201d This article was amended on 6 March 2015. The original suggested NAB was considering a plan to raise interest rates for farmers with poor environmental management. This has been corrected.",

Natural capital issues are economic issues, we need to understand energy risk and have good sustainable interests,\u201d Courville said.</p> <p>Since the bank signed the declaration, she said it had developed discounted loan products for renewable energy for landholders such as low-interest solar finance loans to encourage farmers into renewable energy.</p> <p>The bank is also seeking feedback and sentiment from the agribusiness community on land usage issues such as mining and coal seam gas.</p> <p>\u201cWe are monitoring the sentiment of agribusiness community and take that into account when lending as mining, including coal seam gas, are sensitive industries and require an increased level of due diligence.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 6 March 2015. The original suggested NAB was considering a plan to raise interest rates for farmers with poor environmental management. This has been corrected.</li> </ul>",
