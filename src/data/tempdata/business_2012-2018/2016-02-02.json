      "bodyText": "BP is to axe another 7,000 jobs after reporting an annual loss of $6.5bn (\u00a34.5bn), the worst in its history. Shares in the oil company dived 8.6% to 335p by the end of trading on Tuesday, wiping almost \u00a36bn off the stock market value of the business, and helped drag down the wider FTSE 100 index of leading shares in London. The poor financial performance of BP, followed by a 68% fall in quarterly profits from rival Exxon Mobil in the US and further weakness in the price of crude, depressed stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic on Tuesday. The FTSE 100 finished the day down 2.2% at 5922.01 points, while in New York, the Dow Jones fell more than 230 points, or 1.4%, in early trading. Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at Spreadex, a betting company that follows the stock market, said: \u201cThe resumption of Brent crude\u2019s decline has been the main catalyst for the day\u2019s dismal trading. And, as ever, when the commodities begin to fall, the FTSE loses its way in pretty dramatic fashion.\u201d Bob Dudley, BP\u2019s chief executive, said investors who were selling their oil company shares were overreacting and had overlooked BP\u2019s strong cash flow. Dudley blamed the annual loss, plus a fourth-quarter deficit of $2.2bn, on the collapse in oil prices, coupled with the continuing fallout from paying off liabilities for the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. \u201cWe\u2019re making good progress in managing and lowering our costs and capital spending while maintaining safe and reliable operations and continuing disciplined investment into the future of our portfolio,\u201d he said. BP expects the oil price to remain depressed for most of this year, but is confident that it will begin to recover from a current level of about $33 a barrel in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and move to $50-$60. In the meantime, the company plans to divest up to $8bn of assets over the next two years and cut 4,000 jobs from its exploration arm and 3,000 from \u201cdownstream\u201d refining. Many of the exploration posts will be in Houston, but some could also be in Aberdeen. Dudley said BP would continue to invest in the North Sea on projects such as the \u00a34.5bn Clair Ridge, and praised action taken by the British government to pump money into Aberdeen and reduce offshore taxes. He ruled out any chance of BP moving its London headquarters in the event of the UK leaving the European Union following the referendum. But Dudley added: \u201cI think it\u2019s good for Britain to be part of the EU.\u201d BP said it has set aside a further $440m over the past three months for liabilities associated with Deepwater Horizon, bringing the total bill so far to $55bn. The underlying profit for the last three months, not counting the Gulf and other factors, was down from $2.2bn last time to $196m, much worse than analysts had expected. A consensus among 17 analysts ahead of the results predicted that underlying profits would fall in the final three months to $730m, down almost 70% on the same period a year earlier. The biggest problem for BP has come from low crude prices, with Brent averaging $44 a barrel across the fourth quarter, compared with $77 for the same period 12 months earlier. Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co in New York, said the loss was BP\u2019s worst performance, but the headline figure of $6.5bn obscured the fact that the company was doing quite well in a most difficult environment. \u201cNo one is making money [in the key North American market] at $30 per barrel [of] oil and every oil company is taking as many writedowns as they can. These are largely paper losses and it\u2019s an absolute overreaction to mark down BP shares by 9%,\u201d he said. BP insisted that its dividend was safe for the time being, but warned that it could still wrack up even more losses in future \u2013 at a relatively low level \u2013 from Deepwater Horizon. Dudley said BP was constantly looking at new markets, including Iran, but was equally interested in places such as Mexico and Brazil. The company had no interest in taking a larger stake in Rosneft or any new holding in Saudi Aramco should opportunities open up from possible privatisations by the cash-strapped governments of Russia and Saudi Arabia, he added.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cOil prices continue to be challenging in the near term,\u201d says BP. You bet. The oil major fell to a record loss of $6.5bn (\u00a34.5bn) last year, and that period included a final quarter in which the oil price averaged $44 (\u00a330.50) a barrel. Brent now stands at $33 (\u00a322.90) a barrel. How much pain can BP take before cutting its dividend? There\u2019s no need to panic, says chief executive Bob Dudley, once again pledging a commitment to a dividend that currently offers a yield of 8% on a share price down 9% on Tuesday. Top marks for loyalty to those investors holding BP stock for income \u2013 which include many of our pension funds \u2013 but is this just a refusal to face financial facts? Actually \u2013 not yet. If the dividend is the top priority, Dudley &amp; co probably still have a year to wait and see if BP\u2019s \u201cbalance point\u201d of $60 oil materialises. The payment to shareholders is the smallest of the three big spending buckets. The largest is $24bn of running costs, which is why 7,000 jobs will be lost over the next two years. BP reckons its cash costs will be $7bn lower in 2017 than in 2014. Then comes capital expenditure, which has been hacked in stages to about $17bn this year. Dividends, meanwhile, currently cost $6.6bn, which is hardly a trivial sum, but can be funded by increasing borrowings. Purists will say that an unearned dividend paid out of debt isn\u2019t a real dividend, and they\u2019re right. But such objections always sound better on paper. In the real world, oil majors are obliged to keep faith with shareholders until hope is exhausted. Dudley is just doing what is expected of him. The deeper worry about BP, though, is this: are the current struggles, and cuts and job losses, doing long-term damage to the company\u2019s ability to exploit the next upturn in oil prices, when and if it happens? The reserve replacement ratio was just 61% in 2015, which suggests that BP is shrinking. Shell, even if it has just overpaid for BG Group, can at least say it is getting bigger. Argos is a risk for Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 but perhaps just a small one So much for the idea that Home Retail Group\u2019s shareholders would hold out for 200p-plus a share. That always looked an extreme case of wishful thinking on the part of investors whose stock was trading at 100p before Sainsbury\u2019s showed up, and so it has proved. The supermarket group has secured an agreement with the board at 161.3p, or 25p less if one strips out Homebase, due to be sold to Wesfarmers of Australia. Mind you, to listen to Sainsbury\u2019s finance director, John Rogers, you might ask why Home Retail didn\u2019t insist on more. \u201cEssentially, we\u2019re buying Argos for around \u00a3250m,\u201d declared Rogers. His mathematics work like this. The ex-Homebase price equates to \u00a31.1bn. Adjust for the \u00a3250m of cash on Home Retail\u2019s balance sheet; then deduct the \u00a3600m loan book; and, hey presto, you\u2019ve paid \u00a3250m for the actual Argos business. A fair view of the financials? Up to a point. The cash adjustment is straightforward and the value of the loans to customers is reasonably solid. On the other hand, Sainsbury\u2019s won\u2019t be flipping the loan book to a third party for cash. Instead, it will be bundled into Sainsbury\u2019s Bank, which can raise deposits to finance the loans cheaply, albeit only after a \u00a3100m reinforcement of the capital buffers. That manoeuvre is not as miraculous as Rogers makes out, but is definitely neat. Nobody, though, should do a deal just because the financing is clever. The wisdom of this adventure will stand and fall by the supposed \u201cmultichannel\u201d wonders in prospect. The way Sainsbury\u2019s tells it, it can secure a top-line profit improvement of \u00a3120m in the third year, to be set against exceptional costs of \u00a3140m plus the same again in \u201cincremental\u201d capital expenditure. If it all works out, the pay-back looks reasonable. But many uncertainties lie behind those calculations. How many customers will leak away as Argos units are closed and replacements opened in Sainsbury\u2019s stores? Will new stores-within-stores deliver the anticipated leg-up to both formats? And can decline be arrested at the rump standalone Argos stores? Multichannel heaven could easily descend into a messy mash-up that distracts from the day-job of keeping Tesco at bay. On balance, though, you can understand why Sainsbury\u2019s wants to take the risk. The price is OK, and Argos\u2019s \u00a34.5bn of non-food sales are not be sniffed at. It\u2019s a punt worth taking \u2013 just. Ocado: on time for customers, but for shareholders? Not so much Having 500,000 happy customers is an achievement to shout about. So is a 95.3% success rate for on-time deliveries. The trouble is, the delivery that matters most to Ocado\u2019s shareholders \u2013 a partnership deal with an overseas retailer \u2013 is still awaited. It was promised last year, but didn\u2019t happen. Now Ocado chief Tim Steiner says he expects to sign \u201cmultiple deals in multiple territories in the medium term\u201d. Having been bitten once, you can understand why he is reluctant to set a deadline. But the phrase \u201cmedium term\u201d is horribly vague. If he means the deal may not happen this year, you can understand why the shares shed 7%.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cOil prices continue to be challenging in the near term,\u201d says BP. You bet. The oil major <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/02/bp-annual-loss-biggest-for-20-years-axes-thousands-of-jobs-deepwater\">fell to a record loss of $6.5bn (\u00a34.5bn) last year</a>, and that period included a final quarter in which the oil price averaged $44 (\u00a330.50) a barrel. Brent now stands at $33 (\u00a322.90) a barrel. How much pain can BP take before cutting its dividend?</p> <p>There\u2019s no need to panic, says chief executive Bob Dudley, once again pledging a commitment to a dividend that currently offers a yield of 8% on a share price down 9% on Tuesday. Top marks for loyalty to those investors holding BP stock for income \u2013 which include many of our pension funds \u2013 but is this just a refusal to face financial facts?</p> <p>Actually \u2013 not yet. If the dividend is the top priority, Dudley &amp; co probably still have a year to wait and see if BP\u2019s \u201cbalance point\u201d of $60 oil materialises. The payment to shareholders is the smallest of the three big spending buckets. The largest is $24bn of running costs, which is why 7,000 jobs will be lost over the next two years. BP reckons its cash costs will be $7bn lower in 2017 than in 2014. Then comes capital expenditure, which has been hacked in stages to about $17bn this year. Dividends, meanwhile, currently cost $6.6bn, which is hardly a trivial sum, but can be funded by increasing borrowings.</p> <p>Purists will say that an unearned dividend paid out of debt isn\u2019t a real dividend, and they\u2019re right. But such objections always sound better on paper. In the real world, oil majors are obliged to keep faith with shareholders until hope is exhausted. Dudley is just doing what is expected of him.</p> <p>The deeper worry about BP, though, is this: are the current struggles, and cuts and job losses, doing long-term damage to the company\u2019s ability to exploit the next upturn in oil prices, when and if it happens? The reserve replacement ratio was just 61% in 2015, which suggests that BP is shrinking. Shell, even if it has just overpaid for BG Group, can at least say it is getting bigger.</p> <h2>Argos is a risk for Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 but perhaps just a small one</h2> <p>So much for the idea that Home Retail Group\u2019s shareholders would hold out for 200p-plus a share. That always looked an extreme case of wishful thinking on the part of investors whose stock was trading at 100p before Sainsbury\u2019s showed up, and so it has proved. The supermarket group <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/02/sainsburys-agrees-terms-13bn-deal-buy-home-retail-group\">has secured an agreement with the board</a> at 161.3p, or 25p less if one strips out Homebase, due to be sold to Wesfarmers of Australia.</p> <p>Mind you, to listen to Sainsbury\u2019s finance director, John Rogers, you might ask why Home Retail didn\u2019t insist on more. \u201cEssentially, we\u2019re buying Argos for around \u00a3250m,\u201d declared Rogers. His mathematics work like this. The ex-Homebase price equates to \u00a31.1bn. Adjust for the \u00a3250m of cash on Home Retail\u2019s balance sheet; then deduct the \u00a3600m loan book; and, hey presto, you\u2019ve paid \u00a3250m for the actual Argos business.</p> <p>A fair view of the financials? Up to a point. The cash adjustment is straightforward and the value of the loans to customers is reasonably solid. On the other hand, Sainsbury\u2019s won\u2019t be flipping the loan book to a third party for cash. Instead, it will be bundled into Sainsbury\u2019s Bank, which can raise deposits to finance the loans cheaply, albeit only after a \u00a3100m reinforcement of the capital buffers. That manoeuvre is not as miraculous as Rogers makes out, but is definitely neat.</p> <p>Nobody, though, should do a deal just because the financing is clever. The wisdom of this adventure will stand and fall by the supposed \u201cmultichannel\u201d wonders in prospect. The way Sainsbury\u2019s tells it, it can secure a top-line profit improvement of \u00a3120m in the third year, to be set against exceptional costs of \u00a3140m plus the same again in \u201cincremental\u201d capital expenditure. If it all works out, the pay-back looks reasonable.</p> <p>But many uncertainties lie behind those calculations. How many customers will leak away as Argos units are closed and replacements opened in Sainsbury\u2019s stores? Will new stores-within-stores deliver the anticipated leg-up to both formats? And can decline be arrested at the rump standalone Argos stores? Multichannel heaven could easily descend into a messy mash-up that distracts from the day-job of keeping Tesco at bay.</p> <p>On balance, though, you can understand why Sainsbury\u2019s wants to take the risk. The price is OK, and Argos\u2019s \u00a34.5bn of non-food sales are not be sniffed at. It\u2019s a punt worth taking \u2013 just.</p> <h2>Ocado: on time for customers, but for shareholders?

      "bodyText": "Even a stopped clock is right twice a day so there will come a point when the Bank of England\u2019s forecasts for rising wage inflation will be vindicated. But not for a while. That\u2019s the main conclusion of the latest paper from Danny Blanchflower and Steve Machin, which argues that the labour market will need to tighten substantially further before pay growth starts to pick up. Here\u2019s the background. Every quarter the Bank provides forecasts for the UK economy in its Inflation Report, and every quarter it predicts an imminent acceleration in the level of wage settlements triggered by falling unemployment. In November, the Bank pencilled in average earnings growth of 3.4% for 2016, 3.7% for 2017, 3.6% for 2018, 3.7% for 2019 and 3.9% for 2020. The projected increase never seems to materialise, which is why on Thursday UK interest rates will be pegged at 0.5% for the 84th successive month. The next Inflation Report will also be published on Thursday and it will seek to explain why rising wage inflation has once again been delayed. Blanchflower and Machin have consistently said that the Bank is underestimating the amount of slack in the labour market and that, as a result, the level of pay growth will continue to bump along at its current rate of about 2%. Much to the chagrin of the Bank, the two academics have been consistently right. There can be slack in the labour market for a number of reasons. It could arise as a result of people working part time when they really want to work full time. It could be the result of former employees \u2013 say of a hairdressing salon or a plumbing firm \u2013 being laid off and then setting up their own businesses with just a handful of customers that keep them busy for a few hours a week. It could reflect the impact of an increase in the supply of labour caused by inward migration from eastern Europe, which Blanchflower and Machin believe puts a lid on wage growth. The paper, published by the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, pulls various factors together to come up with an estimate of under-employment in the UK, which it says has come down from a peak of 11% to just under 7%. Blanchflower and Machin estimate that wage inflation will not take off until under-employment falls below 5%, and will start to rise more sharply when under-employment is below 4%. Two things are interesting about the paper. Firstly, it suggests that the relationship between the state of the labour market and pay is non-linear: a falling under-employment rate has little or no impact on earnings growth until a trigger point is reached. Secondly, it is a more believable assessment of what has been happening than anything the Bank has so far come up with.",

      "bodyText": "Ocado\u2019s management team is in line to receive nearly \u00a38m in share bonuses after the online grocer delivered its second year of profits. About 100 managers, including chief executive Tim Steiner and finance director Duncan Tatton-Brown, will share the \u00a37.8m payout \u2013 up 54.5% year on year \u2013 after the company made a pretax profit of \u00a311.9m in the 12 months to 29 November, up 65.3% on the previous year. Sales rose 14.7% to \u00a31.1bn, partly boosted by nearly \u00a374m in revenues from supply services to Morrisons\u2019 online business. Ocado also delivers Waitrose groceries as part of its own grocery service and runs specialist pets site Fetch and kitchen goods site Sizzle. Steiner said Ocado had attracted more customers in a \u201cvery challenging market environment\u201d where it had been forced to cut prices in the face of commodity deflation and a price war among the big supermarket chains. \u201cThe continued enhancement of Ocado\u2019s industry-leading technology and investment into our retail proposition over the course of the year has meant our customers now have greater choice, competitive prices and consistently high order accuracy and on-time delivery,\u201d he said. Steiner said he could not promise that the company would make a profit every year from now on. He said a second year of profits was \u201ccertainly not a strategic target\u201d as the company was investing in building its business for the longer term. Shares in Ocado closed down nearly 7% at 245p as the company admitted that it was yet to confirm a deal with any overseas retail partner to use its IT and technology. Steiner had said he expected to confirm such a deal \u2013 the idea of which transformed investors\u2019 view of Ocado from a niche grocery firm into a potentially international tech stock with huge growth potential \u2013 by the end of last year. Steiner said that he had learned to be \u201ca bit less optimistic about time lines\u201d over the last year, in terms of signing new partners, but he was still very confident that multiple deals with multiple partners would be done in the medium term. He said such deals were still a \u201cmassive strategic opportunity\u201d and he was untroubled by challenges to 73 patents that Ocado has filed for its technology. He said he expected the vast majority to be granted and they would create a \u201cmoat of protection\u201d around the company\u2019s technology. Steiner said he was not worried about the likely tie-up between Sainsbury\u2019s and Argos, which could potentially make the UK\u2019s second biggest supermarket into a more potent online competitor, while the arrival of Amazon\u2019s fresh food grocery delivery service in the UK would only help to persuade shoppers of the benefit of buying online. Shares in Ocado surged earlier this month on rumours that Amazon was set to make a bid for the British online grocer. But one analyst, Clive Black at Shore Capital, described Amazon as \u201ca potential nemesis for Ocado, not a saviour\u201d, reflecting investor concerns about the US-company\u2019s plans for grocery deliveries in the UK. Steiner said the only thing he knew about rumours of a takeover of Ocado by Amazon, the US online retailer, was what he had read in newspapers. He added: \u201cI don\u2019t need a saviour. I\u2019m not in trouble. We have had lots of nemeses before and most of our history we have had Tesco there \u2013 one of the most respected retailers in the world \u2013 and had to compete with them. We thrive on competition,\u201d he said.",

Steiner had said he expected to confirm such a deal \u2013 the idea of which transformed investors\u2019 view of Ocado from a niche grocery firm into a potentially international tech stock with huge growth potential \u2013 by the end of last year.<br></p> <p>Steiner said that he had learned to be \u201ca bit less optimistic about time lines\u201d over the last year, in terms of signing new partners, but he was still very confident that multiple deals with multiple partners would be done in the medium term.</p> <p>He said such deals were still a \u201cmassive strategic opportunity\u201d and he was untroubled by challenges to 73 patents that Ocado has filed for its technology. He said he expected the vast majority to be granted and they would create a \u201cmoat of protection\u201d around the company\u2019s technology.</p> <p>Steiner said he was not worried about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/02/sainsburys-agrees-terms-13bn-deal-buy-home-retail-group\">the likely tie-up between Sainsbury\u2019s and Argos</a>, which could potentially make the UK\u2019s second biggest supermarket into a more potent online competitor, while the arrival of Amazon\u2019s fresh food grocery delivery service in the UK would only help to persuade shoppers of the benefit of buying online.</p> <p>Shares in Ocado surged earlier this month on rumours that Amazon was set to make a bid for the British online grocer. But one analyst, Clive Black at Shore Capital, described Amazon as \u201ca potential nemesis for Ocado, not a saviour\u201d, reflecting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/30/ocado-shares-plunge-as-amazon-pantry-leaves-supermarkets-anxious\">investor concerns about the US-company\u2019s plans for grocery deliveries in the UK</a>.</p> <p>Steiner said the only thing he knew about rumours of a takeover of Ocado by Amazon, the US online retailer, was what he had read in newspapers. </p> <p>He added: \u201cI don\u2019t need a saviour. I\u2019m not in trouble. We have had lots of nemeses before and most of our history we have had Tesco there \u2013 one of the most respected retailers in the world \u2013 and had to compete with them. We thrive on competition,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron has revived plans to allow shops to open for longer on Sundays despite opposition from some of his Tory backbenchers, trade unions and the Scottish National party. There had been speculation the government would back out of the proposals because of fears Cameron could not get a vote through the House of Commons. But Sajid Javid, the business secretary, confirmed he was pressing ahead with the move, which will allow councils extend Sunday opening hours in their areas if they believe it is the best approach. The announcement provoked an angry backlash from trade unions and Labour because it is being introduced through an amendment to the enterprise bill, meaning there will be less chance for parliamentary scrutiny. Usdaw, the shopworkers\u2019 union, said it broke a promise made by Cameron to consult fully and give MPs time to consider the changes. John Hannett, its general secretary, said: \u201cWhen the government temporarily suspended Sunday trading laws for the 2012 Olympics, ministers gave categorical assurances that any attempt to permanently change the law would be subject to a full public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny. \u201cTabling an amendment at this stage breaks that promise and the consultation is not complete until it has been published in full.\u201d The plans are a \u201cbetrayal of shopworkers and all those who regard Sunday as a special day\u201d, he added. Some smaller shops are also worried about the proposals, fearing it will benefit out of town retail parks rather than high streets. James Lowman, chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said: \u201cChanging Sunday trading regulations will not help the high street. It would actually damage small high street stores as trade would get diverted to large out of town supermarkets. \u201cWhile ministers talk of increasing high street sales, our survey of local councils shows that extended Sunday hours would be applied to out of town parks, hurting high streets.\u201d The Church of England also restated its opposition to any relaxation of the current law saying it had seen no evidence that further liberalisation would bring tangible economic benefit. \u201cWe know that over half of shop workers in large stores already feel pressure to work on Sundays, and an increase in opening hours will only lead to more people being pressured into spending Sunday apart from their children and families,\u201d said Alan Smith, bishop of St Albans, in response to Tuesday\u2019s announcement. \u201cThis can only be damaging to community and family life and erode opportunities for shared time and activity, which is central to human flourishing and the common good.\u201d Chancellor George Osborne first announced the plan to consult on changing Sunday trading laws in the budget after the election. But around 20 Tory MPs had warned the prime minister they would team up with the SNP and probably Labour to block the changes. Angela Eagle, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, suggested the party was against making changes to the current Sunday trading legislation. \u201cLabour has been consistent in echoing the voices of small businesses, shopworkers and their families in support of the current arrangements,\u201d she said. \u201cIt works well and means that retailers can trade, customers can shop, and shopworkers can spend time with their families. \u201cThis is at risk under the Tories who are set to make major changes to Sunday trading laws, a policy that wasn\u2019t in their manifesto. They tried it before but wisely abandoned their plans at the last minute in the face of widespread opposition, not least from their own backbenches.\u201d Javid told the House of Commons that the changes would end the \u201cWhitehall knows best\u201d approach to what should be local regulation. He added it is part of attempts to ensure the benefits of economic growth are \u201cfelt in every corner of our country\u201d. Local authorities will be able to restrict the longer hours to certain zones \u2013 such as high streets and city centres. Under the plans, employees would also be able to give one month\u2019s notice to large shops that they do not want to work Sundays and have the option of opting out of working extra hours. Raising a point of order, Kevin Brennan, a shadow business minister, asked if Javid should be informing MPs about changes that have not been published, accusing the government of a \u201cgross abuse of power\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Wall Street loses nearly 1.5% as US crude slips below $30 - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The optimism seen at the end of last week seems to have disappeared as quickly as it came. Crude prices were on the slide once more, given there was no sign of any deal between Opec and the likes of Russia to cut production and stem the supply glut. On top of that, sentiment was hit by major losses at BP and a 48% drop in profits at Exxon Mobil. So Brent crude fell as much as 5% before recovering some ground - and helping markets off their worst levels at the same time. It is currently down 2.8% at $33.26 a barrel. West Texas, which slipped below $30 at one point, is now down 1% at $30.6 a barrel. Adding to the downbeat mood came reports that China was imposing new controls to help control outflows of capital from the country, in particular a cap on people buying insurance from overseas. So despite the marginal recovery, the final scores showed some hefty falls: The FTSE 100 fell 138.09 points or 2.2% to 5922.01 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.8% to 9581.04 France\u2019s Cac closed down 2.47% at 4283.99 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 3.05% to 17,922.45 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.96% at 8528.7 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.84% to 552.5 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 271 points or 1.65%. On that gloomy note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for a busy day of service sector surveys around the globe. As European markets head towards the close nursing heavy losses again Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: The end of January, when markets raced higher, seems such a long time ago. Major indices are rapidly shedding the gains they made in the second half of January, as a cocktail of worries returns. The first of these is the oil price, which has rediscovered its old habit of diving like a stone, helped in no small part by the absence of any rumours about another OPEC meeting. The session started with oil firms in the red, as BP\u2019s results sent the shares into a tail spin, but the company has been joined at the bottom of the index by miners and insurers. The former are down as economic growth concerns take centre stage, with this concern not helped by warnings from Fed policymakers, while the latter are in retreat thanks to China, which appears to be coming up with new and creative ways to try to stem capital flight. The reaction is probably overdone where the likes of Prudential are concerned, but it is hard to remain positive when the tentative rally of the past two weeks is slipping from your grasp. Adding to concerns was ExxonMobil, which is down 3% as the earnings beat fades amidst the stark reality of a remarkable slump in profits. As crude prices slide once more, thanks to markets suddenly waking up and remembering the massive oversupply story, it looks like this sector will be the trailblazer for any renewed slump in stock markets. Back in the UK, and one of the biggest fallers apart from commodity companies is Prudential. The insurance group is down nearly 8% on reports that China might be taking steps to stem outflows of capital. In particular Bloomberg has said the country could impose restrictions on people buying insurance products abroad, with a $5,000 cap per transaction to be imposed from 4 February. Analyst David Morrison at Spread Co said: Amid today\u2019s unsettling stock market action, Prudential stands out as one of the big losers. But this has nothing to do with the announcement that Anne Richards will be joining the Pru from Aberdeen Asset Management later this year. Instead it comes on the back of China\u2019s currency regulator imposing restrictions on its citizens buying overseas insurance products. This isn\u2019t just bad news for the Pru or the insurance sector in general. It raises fears that the Chinese authorities may take further action to limit capital controls. This is a particular worry as we head towards the extended Chinese New Year holiday break. Here are the Dow movers: A sliding crude price and the lack of any major data to give direction have combined to send markets lower, says financial analyst Connor Campbell of Spreadex: Things turned ugly this afternoon, with a woeful performance from Brent Crude and a particularly weak open from the US indices seeing the markets double down on the day\u2019s losses. Now down around 4.5% and threatening to fall below $32 per barrel, the resumption of Brent Crude\u2019s decline has been the main catalyst for the day\u2019s dismal trading. And as ever, when the commodities begin to fall the FTSE loses its way in pretty dramatic fashion, the UK index dropping a whopping 150 points as the day went on. The main casualty was BP; plunging by nearly 10% the oil has lost wave upon wave of investors this Tuesday following the revelation of its worst annual losses for 20 years. Whilst the DAX was prevented from posting the kind of absurd losses it is known for thanks to a record low German unemployment rate figure, the CAC was right up there with its UK peer this afternoon, falling around 2.6% as the day wore on. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Dow Jones quickly sank by 250-ish points after the bell rang on Wall Street, exactly what the markets didn\u2019t need following such an awful morning in Europe. The lack of truly significant data likely exacerbated today\u2019s losses, investors left with little other option but to focus on the same fears that have caused the markets to start 2016 in such dire fashion. Tomorrow, then, maybe slightly better, with a cavalcade of services figures around the globe set to distract the markets (however briefly or successfully is unclear) from their current malaise. The Alphabet success comes as the overall market has moved sharply lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 241 points or 1.46%, as Wall Street follows other markets lower. Fears of a global slowdown in the wake of weak industrial data this week have unnerved investors once more, while oil continues to slide as hopes fade of a deal between Opec and other oil countries - Russia in particular - to cut production. Brent crude is down 5% at $32.5 while West Texas has slipped below $30 a barrel. Elsewhere the S&amp;P is down 1.4% while the falls on European markets are accelerating. The FTSE 100 is now down 154 points or 2.5% while Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.35% and France\u2019s Cac has lost 2.1%. Alphabet shares have jumped more than 4% at the open, valuing it at around $545bn. In contrast Apple is down almost 1% to give it a market capitalisation of around $530bn. Wall Street has opened and Alphabet has indeed overtaken Apple to become the world\u2019s largest listed company. UK energy group British Gas has announced it will axe 500 jobs as part of a cost cutting programme by its parent company Centrica. It did not say where or when the cuts would be made, according to Reuters which quotes British Gas chief executive Mark Hodges as saying: British Gas is well positioned to grow but we must ensure that our costs allow us to be competitive for our customers. Back with big oil, and Exxon Mobil has unveiled a 48% drop in its fourth quarter profit to $2.78bn and said it would cut spending this year by a quarter. That follows news that BP has made its biggest ever loss and plans 7,000 job cuts. The sell-off in stock markets is continuing, with the FTSE 100 now down 116 points or 1.9%. BP, now down 8.4%, has contributed around 21 points to the fall. Oil and mining companies as a whole have knocked some 50 points off the index. In Europe Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.3% and France\u2019s Cac is 2% lower. At the moment, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are showing a 128 point loss on the US index when Wall Street opens. Whether that has an impact on Google - sorry Alphabet - overtaking Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable listed company remains to be seen. Worried about China? Maybe you\u2019re not worried enough. Royal Bank of Scotland has issued an online research note today, explaining how China\u2019s economy could hit trouble. Senior Economist Marcus Wright fears that China\u2019s economy has slowed more quickly than official data shows, and is struggling to break its addiction to debt (which helped fuel growth in recent years) This means Beijing is struggling to rebalance the economy in the face of a credit boom, triggering recent market turbulence and fears of a disorderly yuan devaluation. Wright predicts that a \u201chard landing\u201d is a serious risk for China, with consequences for countries worldwide. He says: China\u2019s slowdown is already impacting the global economy through the channels of growth, trade, inflation, interest rate expectation and financial linkages. There is more to come on all these fronts. The full presentation is online here. RBS have helpfully tweeted some of the key charts: Our energy editor Terry Macalister has established that BP is actually planning to cut 7,000 more jobs, more than first thought, after reporting an an annual loss of $6.5bn this morning. Terry also reports that CEO Bob Dudley thinks investors are \u201coverreacting\u201d by sending its shares down by 9% so far today.... Over in Greece, the negotiations between Athens and its creditors over its bailout programme have taken a curious twist, as talks resume today. The EU side has apparently hinted that Greece might get an easier ride, if it does a better job processing the refugees arriving on its shores from the Middle East. The Greek newspaper Kathimerini explains: Greek authorities are scrambling to set up screening centers for migrants and refugees as soon as possible as German officials have made it clear to Athens that more efficient management of the refugee crisis could help along creditors\u2019 review of the country\u2019s third bailout, Kathimerini understands. According to sources, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has indicated to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras that success in tackling the migration crisis could boost the country\u2019s prospects for progress with the review, which Athens hopes could ease the way for debt talks. Combined with a burgeoning debate about Greece\u2019s future in the passport-free Schengen area, the message from Berlin is said to have encouraged action by Greek officials. Blackmail? Bribery? Or an attempt to fix two problems in one go? Currently, some refugees trying to move west from Greece are stranded at the border with Macedonia, due to anti-austerity protests held by farmers. BP\u2019s share price continues to wilt as analysts digest today\u2019s slump in profits/record loss (depending what measure you pick). It is currently down 8.8%, which by my reckoning wipes \u00a35.8bn off its market capitalisation. BP boss Bob Dudley has also warned that other oil companies will follow his lead and slash jobs, in response to the slide in the crude price. ITV\u2019s Joel Hills has the details: The oil sector is churning out the rumours today, as the crude price drops. The latest one is that member of the OPEC cartel are still resisting an emergency meeting where a production cut could be hammered out. That\u2019s despite the pain being suffered across the oil-producing countries, with Saudi facing serious austerity, Nigeria seeking help from the World Bank, and Russia apparently considering privatising various state assets. BP is briefing journalists in London now, after reporting its biggest annual loss in at least 20 years. The oil giant is predicting a volatile 2016, and warning that the cost of the Deepwater Horizon spill disaster is still rising. The oil is continuing to weaken, mirroring the selloff in the equity markets. Brent crude is now off 3.7% or $1.20 at $32.97 per barrel, hit by persistent fears of economic slowdown and oversupply in the oil market. And the Russian rouble is falling in sympathy, as cheaper oil brings more trouble for struggling petro-exporters. Tim Condon, head of Asia research at ING, fears that the oil sector is locked in a vicious downward spiral with factories. Oil companies cut spending last year after crude prices fell sharply, which meant they ordered less from manufacturers. That hit factory growth, and also meant they needed less energy. That hit demand for oil, helping to push stockpiles up and prices down. Or as Condon put it to clients: \u201cManufacturing is (the) leading edge of a global growth slowdown.\u201d \u201cWe think the 50% crash in global oil prices in the second half of 2014 caused the manufacturing slump by crushing commodity producers\u2019 spending. However, we also think that in 2015 weaker manufacturing, especially in China, began to drive down oil prices. The negative feedback loop is causing severe strains.\u201d Mario Draghi and colleagues at the European Central Bank will be relieved that the eurozone jobless rate fell last month, as they ponder whether to take new stimulus measures next month. Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners, says investors expect action in March. Traders and investors assumed from the latest ECB press conference that further cuts in the deposit rate and perhaps an extension and expansion of Quantitative Easing are potentially on the cards. Today\u2019s selloff has wiped out almost all the spike last Friday, after the Bank of Japan took the dramatic step of introducing negative interest rates. Central bank stimulus packages don\u2019t have the impact they used to, as investors worry that the global economy is heading remorselessly downwards. Brenda Kelly of London Capital Group explains: It would seem that central bank impact is really beginning to lose its charm and the days of buying the dip on the back of stimulus expectations is no longer the winning strategy it once was. We\u2019re back to the same old story today with materials and energy providing a drag on the FTSE as BP delivered what was frankly a terrible set of results \u2013 its worst loss in 20 years. Breaking: The Eurozone unemployment rate has hit its lowest level since September 2011. Eurostat is reporting that the region\u2019s jobless rate dipped in December to 10.4%, from 10.5%. Across the wider EU, the jobless rate remained at 9.0%. Although the fall is encouraging, it still leaves 21.944 million men and women out of work in the 28 members of the EU, including 16.750m in the euro area. There were, as usual, stark difference across Europe too. Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates in December 2015 were recorded in the Czech Republic and Germany (both 4.5%), Malta and the United Kingdom (both 5.1%, October data for the UK). The highest unemployment rates were observed in Greece (24.5% in October 2015) and Spain (20.8%). More gloom. Growth in Britain\u2019s building sector has hit a nine-month low, according to new figures from data firm Markit. Markit\u2019s UK construction PMI has fallen to 55.0 in January, from 57.8 in December. That suggests growth slowed to its lowest rate since April 2015. The survey found that:\uf0a7 UK construction sector experiences growth slowdown at the start of 2016 Job creation eases to its slowest for almost two-and-a-half years Construction firms report lowest business confidence since December 2014 Worries about global growth and weak, falling oil prices are back under the spotlight today, warns Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote Bank. And that\u2019s why the European markets are sliding again. The FTSE 100 is now down 85 points, and being dragged lower by oil companies, banks and miners: Investors are also gloomy after yesterday\u2019s factory data. It showed the US manufacturing sector was not as strong as hoped, while China continued to weaken. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains: Yesterday afternoon\u2019s US economic data was pretty consistently below expectations, reinforcing the clear signs that global manufacturing is down in the dumps. BP\u2019s poor results are also a reminder of the havoc playing out in the oil sector, as hopes of a deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut production dwindle. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says: Tepid manufacturing data from China, the world\u2019s largest energy consumer, renewed fears that demand may be dwindling. These anxieties added to the rapidly fading expectations around OPEC cooperating with Russia to curb production, while ongoing concerns over the excessive oversupply of oil in the markets continued to haunt investors. BP\u2019s CEO, Bob Dudley, has warned that the oil price will remain volatile until the second half of 2016. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, he predicted spikes - up and down - in the next few months as Iran returns to the oil market. Just in: Germany\u2019s unemployment rate has hit a new record low of just 6.2%. Destatis, the stats body, reports that the German jobless total fell by 20,000 in January, compared to expectations of an 8,000 decline. Another difficult morning is unfolding on the European stock markets. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 1.3%, or 82 points, to 5977. BP is partly to blame - it has knocked 17 points off the Footsie on it own, and also dragged rival Royal Dutch Shell down too (it reports results on Thursday). Mining shares are also down, with BHP Billiton off 4%. Across the channel, Germany\u2019s DAX is down 0.9% and the French CAC is down 1.3% BP\u2019s stonking loss has hit shares across the energy sector: Shares in BP have slumped at the start of trading, after the energy giant reported its worst loss in 20 years. BP shares fell 5.8%, or 21p, to 345p as investors reacted to the news that it lost $6.482bn in 2015, on a pre-tax basis, compared to a profit of \u00a33.780bn in 2014. That, Reuters reports, is the biggest loss in two decades. Oil companies like to report their results in \u201cunderlying replacement cost profit\u201d terms, to strip out the impact of the fluctuating oil price. But even then, BP\u2019s results are worse than expected. It reported a 91% drop in underlying profits in the last three months, to just $196m. It\u2019s bad news for workers - BP is planning to cut an extra 3,000 jobs in its downstream unit by the end of 2017, on top of 4,000 earlier cuts. After weeks of haggling, Sainsbury has finally secured the takeover of Home Retail - owner of catalogue shopping chain Argus. The two sides reached terms overnight of a \u00a31.3bn merger. This is Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe\u2019s first big deal -- he\u2019s hoping to repel the march of Amazon, and rising pressure from discount grocers. Assuming shareholders back the deal, Sainsbury will soon be installing Argos outlets in its stores. My colleague Sean Farrell has the details of the deal: Britain\u2019s second-biggest supermarket has proposed paying Home Retail shareholders 55p in cash and 0.321 Sainsbury\u2019s shares for each of their shares, valuing Home Retail at \u00a31.1bn. Under the terms of the proposed deal, Home Retail shareholders would also get a further \u00a3200m from the sale of Homebase, Home retail\u2019s DIY and homewares business. Along with a 2.8p per share payment in lieu of a final dividend, the proposed offer values Home Retail at 161.3p a share or about \u00a31.3bn. Most Asian stock markets lost ground today, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei closing 0.64% lower. China bucked the trend, though, jumping over 2%, after the People\u2019s Bank of China pumped more money into the system. Marketwatch explains why: China\u2019s central bank injected 100 billion yuan ($15.2 billion) in short-term loans to money markets, in a move to stave off potential liquidity squeezes ahead of the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday that starts on February 7. This is the first leg of the bank\u2019s usual twice-a-week money-market operations. Overnight, Australia\u2019s central bank left interest rates unchanged at the record low of 2%. But it also warned it could cut soon if the recent financial market turbulence continues. Worries over the strength of the global economy has pushed the gold price up to its highest level since the start of November. Bullion hit $1,130 per ounce in early reading, as investors scurried for safe-havens in the face of recent weak economic data. Fears over China were also rife, after yesterday\u2019s data showed its factory sector shrinking at the fastest rate since 2012. Japan\u2019s move into negative interest rates on Friday has also caused jitters, as traders wonder whether further unconventional monetary policy will be deployed soon. And this uncertainty is making gold more attractive. Reuters explains: With rates close to zero, the \u201conly option is to move either towards zero or negative rates as the Japanese and selected European countries are already doing in a desperate attempt to force banks to lend\u201d, INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir wrote to clients. \u201cWhatever the case, this should be constructive for gold.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling overage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Worries over the global economy continue to weigh on markets today, after yesterday\u2019s disappointing manufacturing surveys from China and the US. The main European markets are expected to dip, extending yesterday\u2019s selloff: On the data front, we find out at 10am whether Europe\u2019s jobs market improved in December. The main eurozone jobless rate is expected to remain at 10.5% , matching the four-year low reached in November. And at 9.30am, we also get the latest survey of the UK construction sector for January. Last week we learned that the building industry contracted in the last quarter of 2015, so analysts will be hoping for signs of recovery. In the City, oil giant BP and online supermarket Ocado are reporting financial results. As feared, BP has suffered from the slump in the oil price. It\u2019s also outlining significant job cuts. And supermarket chain Sainsbury has been hammering out the terms of a takeover for Home Retail, to get control of its Argos shops.",

Crude prices were on the slide once more, given there was no sign of any deal between Opec and the likes of Russia to cut production and stem the supply glut. On top of that, sentiment was hit by major losses at BP and a 48% drop in profits at Exxon Mobil.</p> <p>So Brent crude fell as much as 5% before recovering some ground - and helping markets off their worst levels at the same time. It is currently down 2.8% at $33.26 a barrel. West Texas, which slipped below $30 at one point, is now down 1% at $30.6 a barrel.</p> <p>Adding to the downbeat mood came reports that China was imposing new controls to help control outflows of capital from the country, in particular a cap on people buying insurance from overseas.</p> <p>So despite the marginal recovery, the final scores showed some hefty falls:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 138.09 points or 2.2% to 5922.01</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.8% to 9581.04</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 2.47% at 4283.99</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 3.05% to 17,922.45</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.96% at 8528.7</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.84% to 552.5</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 271 points or 1.65%.</p> <p><em>On that gloomy note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

Major indices are rapidly shedding the gains they made in the second half of January, as a cocktail of worries returns. The first of these is the oil price, which has rediscovered its old habit of diving like a stone, helped in no small part by the absence of any rumours about another OPEC meeting.</p> <p>The session started with oil firms in the red, as BP\u2019s results sent the shares into a tail spin, but the company has been joined at the bottom of the index by miners and insurers. The former are down as economic growth concerns take centre stage, with this concern not helped by warnings from Fed policymakers, while the latter are in retreat thanks to China, which appears to be coming up with new and creative ways to try to stem capital flight. The reaction is probably overdone where the likes of Prudential are concerned, but it is hard to remain positive when the tentative rally of the past two weeks is slipping from your grasp.</p> <p>Adding to concerns was ExxonMobil, which is down 3% as the earnings beat fades amidst the stark reality of a remarkable slump in profits. As crude prices slide once more, thanks to markets suddenly waking up and remembering the massive oversupply story, it looks like this sector will be the trailblazer for any renewed slump in stock markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b0cd3ee4b054341b6d0f04\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:41:42.361Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back in the UK, and one of the biggest fallers apart from commodity companies is Prudential.</strong></p> <p>The insurance group is down nearly 8% on reports that China might be taking steps to stem outflows of capital.

This isn\u2019t just bad news for the Pru or the insurance sector in general. It raises fears that the Chinese authorities may take further action to limit capital controls.

Tomorrow, then, maybe slightly better, with a cavalcade of services figures around the globe set to distract the markets (however briefly or successfully is unclear) from their current malaise.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b0bfcce4b048ec83a7658e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T14:45:44.300Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street drops nearly 250 points, with US crude below $30</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Alphabet success comes as the overall market has moved sharply lower.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 241 points or 1.46%, as Wall Street follows other markets lower.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a grey and dismal morning on a grim stretch of London\u2019s congested North Circular road in the borough of Brent, and easyFoodstore, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou\u2019s first budget grocery shop, has thrown open its doors, with every item priced at 25p. Prices will eventually rise, most probably to about 50p, but the plan is to launch a new player that sits in between food banks and discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl. EasyFoodstore is being launched into a grocery sector already in the grip of a fierce price war, as the big four supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 have reacted to the growing number of consumers switching to discounters. In January, the cost of a basket of 35 popular grocery products was \u00a385.80, 2% lower than a year before, according to comparison website MySupermarket. Even so, Haji-Ioannou\u2019s latest venture is taking discounting to a new level, although choice is limited to 76 products for now. Locals in Brent have come, more in dribs and drabs than droves, to see what all the fuss is about. What greets them is an office \u2013 formerly used by another Haji-Ioannou business, easyBus \u2013 converted into a grocery store, bedecked in the by now familiar \u201ceasy orange\u201d colour synonymous with easyJet and the other \u201ceasy\u201d brands. Digestive biscuits, tinned peas, spaghetti hoops and Bombay mix are all here, although the chips have already sold out. Bedros Kabrielian, 50, looks pretty chuffed with a groaning box of such goods, picked up for a grand total of \u00a38. He found his way here thanks to a leafleting campaign designed to lure people in and hook them on budget groceries. \u201cI know this guy, Stelios,\u201d he says. \u201cHe always has these tricks, but always there\u2019s a catch.\u201d If there is a catch, Kabrielian has not found it yet. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. \u201cWe\u2019ll give it a try and see what sort of quality it is,\u201d he says. Another customer returns to the till in confusion after paying, assuming she must have been undercharged. She wasn\u2019t. If customers like these take to the concept, Haji-Ioannou hopes to roll out more easyFoodstores inside the M25, targeted at customers who struggle to afford even discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. A spokesman is keen to stress that Haji-Ioannou is doing something for people who do not have a lot of money. \u201cSay you\u2019re on benefits and then you get a low-paid job,\u201d says Richard Shackleton, communications director for easyGroup. \u201cYou can\u2019t use the food bank any more, but Sainsbury\u2019s, even Aldi and Lidl, are on the pricey side. You need somewhere you can get the basics for a low price.\u201d The uncertainty lies in whether easyFoodstore can harness the demand for discount grocery options to become one of easyGroup\u2019s successes, like no-frills carrier easyJet. After all, a fair number of the horses to come out of the easyGroup stable have eventually been turned into glue. There can\u2019t be many customers in this shop \u2013 or anywhere \u2013 who remember easyCinema, easy4Men, easyMoney, easyInternetCafe, easyMusic or easyCruise. But despite some of the nags that flopped at the first hurdle, the brand has endured, thanks largely to easyJet. The airline Haji-Ioannou founded \u2013 and in which he still has a 35% stake \u2013 paid him \u00a377m in dividends last year and also provided the lion\u2019s share of the \u00a313.2m turnover easyGroup made by licensing use of its brand. Haji-Ioannou also owns a majority stake in easyHotel, which floated on the stock market in 2014 and plans to undercut budget hotels across Europe. Other parts of the empire work on a slightly different model, with franchisees who own small businesses paying Haji-Ioannou for the right to hitch themselves to his brand. The most recent is easyCoffee, at present just one shop in Earl\u2019s Court, west London, selling Lavazza coffee at \u00a31 a mug. The third business model looks like easyFoodstore, a subsidiary wholly owned by easyGroup. Customers do not necessarily know or care about the corporate architecture behind these differing business models as long as they get a bargain. And Haji-Ioannou, whose charity has long handed out free food to struggling families in Greece and Cyprus, is keen for people to know that he wants to give people a helping hand. \u201cThere is a strong philanthropic thread running through this,\u201d says his spokesman. However, analysts have already formed their own opinions \u2013 and are deeply sceptical. Veteran retail analyst Nick Bubb thinks the company will need to choose more salubrious sites than the pilot store\u2019s desolate spot. \u201cIt\u2019s an odd location on the busy North Circular and it looks like you can\u2019t easily walk there,\u201d said Bubb. \u201cIt\u2019s sandwiched between a big Sainsbury\u2019s and a big Asda, with no fresh food. [It] will never work.\u201d Location has proved problematic for the company before. Croydon council scuppered Haji-Ioannou\u2019s plans to launch there, and Shackleton admits that finding suitable freeholds has been difficult. Andrew Stevens, of Verdict Retail, points out that while shoppers defected to Aldi and Lidl on price grounds, they stuck around because the quality was good. \u201cIn order for easyFoodstore to acquire shoppers from the discounters, it needs to be able to offer equivalent or better quality at an even lower price,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be difficult without significant scale.\u201d In some respects though, it does not matter whether easyFoodstore ends up in the knacker\u2019s yard, as long as it does not cost too much in the process. Given that easyGroup relies on income from branding, there is no such thing as bad publicity. And as long as easyJet continues to deliver massive dividends, Haji-Ioannou will always have the money to spend on trying his hand at new business ventures. The easyGroup conveyor belt is unlikely to end at the easyFoodstore checkout.",

It works like a veg box scheme, but with fish, and members subscribe and collect fish weekly. </p> <p>The fish is sourced direct from fishermen using low-impact methods that are kind to the marine environment. They are a paid a fair price and members are encouraged to eat a wider range of locally-caught species, which benefits fish stocks.

It works like a veg box scheme, but with fish, and members subscribe and collect fish weekly. The fish is sourced direct from fishermen using low-impact methods that are kind to the marine environment. They are a paid a fair price and members are encouraged to eat a wider range of locally-caught species, which benefits fish stocks.

      "bodyText": "Nearly a quarter of a million Tesco store staff will receive a 3.1% increase in basic pay this year under a new deal that will also mean cuts to holiday and night-time bonuses. In a similar move, as businesses try to offset costs ahead of the introduction of the national living wage in April, retailer Wilko is considering cutting Sunday, holiday and overtime bonuses for staff. Established staff at Tesco will get \u00a37.62 an hour from July, in anticipation of the \u00a37.20 minimum wage for over-25s introduced by the chancellor, George Osborne, but still less than the living wage calculated by independent campaigners. New employees will see their pay rise from \u00a37.02 to \u00a37.20 in April, in line with government legislation, then to \u00a37.24 in July. All workers will receive time-and-a-half for Sunday and bank holiday shifts from July, meaning that thousands of staff who currently earn double pay for working on those days will lose out. Meanwhile, special payment for night work will only apply from midnight-6am, compared with 10pm-6am at present. Tesco said 85% of staff would be better off under the pay deal and that those who had been negatively affected would be handed a lump-sum payment worth 18 months of the difference in pay. But the wage rise puts Tesco\u2019s terms and conditions well behind that of its rivals, including Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl. Last summer, Sainsbury\u2019s agreed to give 137,000 shopfloor staff a 4% rise to \u00a37.36, its biggest increase in a decade, after pressure from low-pay campaigners. Aldi pledged to increase staff wages to a minimum rate of \u00a38.40 an hour from this month, while Lidl agreed to pay workers at least \u00a38.20 in line with the living wage. Morrisons pays its workers \u00a38.20 an hour \u2013 but it funded that change partly by cutting paid breaks and Sunday pay. Wilko is consulting with its staff on cutting Sunday, bank holiday, overtime pay and bonuses for working in certain areas or in departmental management roles in return for a basic pay rise to \u00a37.65 for over-25s and a rise to \u00a37.20 for 21-to-24-year-olds. Just over 40% of staff will lose out in some way, according to trade union GMB, which is consulting members about the Wilko pay deal. It said more than 2,000 workers would lose out by between \u00a31,000 and \u00a33,000, but that about 1,500 would benefit by the same amount. \u201cThis is a real law of unintended consequences,\u201d said Eamon O\u2019Hearn, GMB national officer. \u201cOsborne\u2019s push for the national living wage has given businesses the opportunity to review their pay arrangements and in the current competitive market, to shift much of the burden on to low-paid staff. The introduction of this basic pay rise will leave a lot of people with a really sour taste in their mouth without the benefits for productivity increases or the wider economy.\u201d Matt Davies, the chief executive of Tesco in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time working with [trade union] Usdaw and colleague representatives to understand what\u2019s important to colleagues. Together, we have agreed one of the highest pay and benefits packages in retail for store colleagues, and introduced a simpler and fairer pay structure, including one approach to premium payments. \u201cAs well as an increase in pay, which puts our hourly rate well above the government\u2019s national living wage, we remain absolutely committed to rewarding our colleagues with a pay and benefits package they really value, including a pension, colleague discount and 5% turnaround bonus.\u201d Pauline Foulkes, a national officer at Usdaw, said the total package for Tesco staff, including a 5% turnaround bonus that employees are on track to receive this year, was well ahead of the living wage and was one of the best in retail. \u201cWe believe the deal is the best that could be achieved in the circumstances and represents a significant investment in pay and benefits.\u201d Wilko was unavailable for comment.

    "webTitle": "Sainsbury's agrees terms to buy Home Retail Group in \u00a31.3bn deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has agreed terms to buy Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos, in a \u00a31.3bn deal which will create a combined food and non-food retailer that can take on Amazon and John Lewis. Britain\u2019s second-biggest supermarket has promised to pay Home Retail shareholders 55p in cash and 0.321 Sainsbury\u2019s shares for each of their shares, valuing Home Retail at \u00a31.1bn, subject to regulatory approval and a closer look at the Argos-owner\u2019s books. Under the terms of the proposed deal, Home Retail shareholders would get a further \u00a3200m in cash from the sale of Homebase, Home Retail\u2019s DIY and homewares business. Along with a 2.8p a share payment in lieu of a final dividend, the proposed offer values Home Retail at 161.3p a share or about \u00a31.3bn. Home Retail said its board had decided to recommend the potential offer to shareholders once details are agreed and both sides complete due diligence by examining each other\u2019s books. Home Retail shareholders will own about 12% of the combined company if the deal is completed \u2013 a process likely to take at least three months. Sainsbury\u2019s said the takeover would create the UK\u2019s largest non-food retailer \u2013 ahead of John Lewis or Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 with about 2,000 stores and 100,000 products combined. It plans to put Argos outlets in Sainsbury\u2019s large stores as well as selling items online and expects to generate cost and revenue gains of at least \u00a3120m. Mike Coupe, Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOur customers want us to offer more choice and for that choice to be faster than ever, driven by the rise of mobile phone and digital technology. \u201cIt will enhance both businesses. We are baking a bigger cake than either company can bake by themselves.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s is buying Home Retail as people increasingly shop online or pick up groceries from small neighbourhood stores instead of visiting supermarkets for a weekly shop, threatening large stores with irrelevance. The rapid growth of the discounters Aldi and Lidl has also created a price war, slashing supermarket profits. Sainsbury\u2019s argues buying Argos will allow it to offer a broader range of goods at its stores and offer a wider delivery service \u2013 both to homes and click and collect points in stores. Argos outlets will also provide a useful filler for spare space in Sainsbury\u2019s largest outlets. Louise Cooper, an independent financial analyst, said the proposed deal was groundbreaking because a big UK grocer had never bought a general retailer. . \u201cSainsbury\u2019s needs additional revenue going through the stores to justify their expensive existence. Thus closing Argos stores [at no cost as it just involves not renewing the lease] to open up Argos concessions in Sainsbury\u2019s stores does make sense financially at least in the short term.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s is also interested in Argos\u2019s delivery network and IT systems, which it believes will help it take on Amazon, the US online retailer that is increasing its presence in the UK grocery market. Argos started offering same-day delivery across the UK in October after spending large sums of money upgrading systems and hiring van drivers. The high-street retailer, known for laminated catalogues, order slips and mini pencils, has been trying to reinvent itself as a digital business. Argos\u2019s online sales rose in December but falling demand for games consoles, kitchen appliances and jewellery reduced sales at its stores, prompting a profit warning from Home Retail last month. David Jeary, a retail analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said the terms of Sainsbury\u2019s offer looked attractive for Home Retail shareholders given the business\u2019s recent performance. But he added: \u201cWith the total all-in value of the offer some 20% below the 200p some shareholders were cited as looking for from the bidder \u2013 a level at which the shares were indeed trading a year ago \u2013 this therefore looks like a case of \u2018possible\u2019 capitulation in our view by Home Retail and its shareholders.\u201d John Walden, Home Retail\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is capitulation. This is fair value for our business. Shareholders might have felt better at 200p but I feel this is great value.\u201d Walden said it was not yet clear if he, or other senior Home Retail managers, would stay on if Sainsbury\u2019s takeover went ahead, but added: \u201cI love the business and am really attached to what we are building and I will help Mike [Coupe] in any way he\u2019d like me to.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s has pursued Home Retail since November when its first approach, worth about \u00a31bn, was rebuffed. The supermarket group was forced to go public on 5 January after rumours of its interest caused Home Retail shares to rise sharply. Since then it is understood two more Sainsbury\u2019s bids were rebuffed before Home Retail agreed to a deal. Sainsbury\u2019s had until 5pm on Tuesday to make a formal offer or walk away for six months. Home Retail\u2019s board asked the takeover panel for a deadline extension until 23 February to allow time for Sainsbury\u2019s to carry out due diligence and seek regulatory clearance. Many analysts and investors have been sceptical about the rationale for the deal, arguing that Coupe and his team could be overburdened by taking on a business in decline. Some analysts have also argued there is a mismatch between Sainsbury\u2019s slightly upmarket niche in the grocery sector and Argos\u2019s less affluent customer base. Coupe said about 40% of shoppers bought goods from Sainsbury\u2019s and Argos and that the success of 10 Argos concessions already in Sainsbury\u2019s stores showed there was no clash between the brands. Coupe said: \u201cThis is one of the myths that seems to be constantly peddled. There is a slight difference [in the groups\u2019 customers] but it\u2019s pretty marginal. When you talk to customers in shops they get this. They think it\u2019s delightfully simples and makes life easier.\u201d He said Sainsbury\u2019s expected shareholders to get behind the deal, which he argued was not risky because Sainsbury\u2019s already sells general merchandise such as clothes, homewares and appliances. Sainsbury\u2019s also believes it can sell its successful Tu clothing range via Argos. Sainsbury\u2019s has kept the cost of the deal relatively low byrefinancing Home Retail\u2019s \u00a3600m customer loan book, which will move into Sainsbury\u2019s bank generating cash for the retail arm of the business. Once cash on Home Retail\u2019s balance sheet is also taken into account, Sainsbury\u2019s said it would be getting the core Argos business for just \u00a3250m net. Coupe said Sainsbury\u2019s would close some Argos stores but that it would also open Argos branches within Sainsbury\u2019s shops and that he expected more people to be employed by Argos as a result. There will be job cuts from combiningsome head office operations, but the businesses are unlikely to move into one building, he said. Home Retail shares closed little changed at 153p and Sainsbury\u2019s shares were up just over 2% to 250.5p.",

Home Retail shareholders will own about 12% of the combined company if the deal is completed \u2013 a process likely to take at least three months.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/05/sainsburys-1bn-bid-home-retail-argos-homebase-rejected\">Sainsbury's \u00a31bn bid for Home Retail Group rejected</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sainsbury\u2019s said the takeover would create the UK\u2019s largest non-food retailer \u2013 ahead of John Lewis or Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 with about 2,000 stores and 100,000 products combined. It plans to put Argos outlets in Sainsbury\u2019s large stores as well as selling items online and expects to generate cost and revenue gains of at least \u00a3120m.</p> <p>Mike Coupe, Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOur customers want us to offer more choice and for that choice to be faster than ever, driven by the rise of mobile phone and digital technology.</p> <p>\u201cIt will enhance both businesses. We are baking a bigger cake than either company can bake by themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s is buying Home Retail as people increasingly shop online or pick up groceries from small neighbourhood stores instead of visiting supermarkets for a weekly shop, threatening large stores with irrelevance.</p> <p>The rapid growth of the discounters Aldi and Lidl has also created a price war, slashing supermarket profits. Sainsbury\u2019s argues buying Argos will allow it to offer a broader range of goods at its stores and offer a wider delivery service \u2013 both to homes and click and collect points in stores. Argos outlets will also provide a useful filler for spare space in Sainsbury\u2019s largest outlets.<br></p> <p>Louise Cooper, an independent financial analyst, said the proposed deal was groundbreaking because a big UK grocer had never bought a general retailer. .</p> <p>\u201cSainsbury\u2019s needs additional revenue going through the stores to justify their expensive existence. Thus closing Argos stores [at no cost as it just involves not renewing the lease] to open up Argos concessions in Sainsbury\u2019s stores does make sense financially at least in the short term.\u201d</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s is also interested in Argos\u2019s delivery network and IT systems, which it believes will help it take on Amazon, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/29/amazon-uk-boss-christoper-north-hails-pantry-grocery-expansion-supermarkets\">the US online retailer that is increasing its presence</a> in the UK grocery market. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/07/argos-squares-up-to-amazon-with-same-day-delivery-across-uk\">Argos started offering same-day delivery</a> across the UK in October after spending large sums of money upgrading systems and hiring van drivers. The high-street retailer, known for laminated catalogues, order slips and mini pencils, has been trying to reinvent itself as a digital business.</p> <p>Argos\u2019s online sales rose in December but falling demand for games consoles, kitchen appliances and jewellery reduced sales at its stores, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/14/argos-sales-threaten-home-retail-profits-homebase-sainsburys\">prompting a profit warning</a> from Home Retail last month.</p> <p>David Jeary, a retail analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said the terms of Sainsbury\u2019s offer looked attractive for Home Retail shareholders given the business\u2019s recent performance. But he added: \u201cWith the total all-in value of the offer some 20% below the 200p some shareholders were cited as looking for from the bidder \u2013 a level at which the shares were indeed trading a year ago \u2013 this therefore looks like a case of \u2018possible\u2019 capitulation in our view by Home Retail and its shareholders.\u201d</p> <p>John Walden, Home Retail\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is capitulation. This is fair value for our business. Shareholders might have felt better at 200p but I feel this is great value.\u201d</p> <p>Walden said it was not yet clear if he, or other senior Home Retail managers, would stay on if Sainsbury\u2019s takeover went ahead, but added: \u201cI love the business and am really attached to what we are building and I will help Mike [Coupe] in any way he\u2019d like me to.\u201d</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/05/sainsburys-1bn-bid-home-retail-argos-homebase-rejected\">pursued Home Retail since November</a> when its first approach, worth about \u00a31bn, was rebuffed. The supermarket group was forced to go public on 5 January after rumours of its interest caused Home Retail shares to rise sharply. Since then it is understood two more Sainsbury\u2019s bids were rebuffed before Home Retail agreed to a deal.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s had until 5pm on Tuesday to make a formal offer or walk away for six months. Home Retail\u2019s board asked the takeover panel for a deadline extension until 23 February to allow time for Sainsbury\u2019s to carry out due diligence and seek regulatory clearance.</p> <p>Many analysts and investors have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/06/qatar-investment-authority-sainsburys-home-retail-group-bid\">been sceptical about the rationale for the deal</a>, arguing that Coupe and his team could be overburdened by taking on a business in decline. Some analysts have also argued there is a mismatch between Sainsbury\u2019s slightly upmarket niche in the grocery sector and Argos\u2019s less affluent customer base.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/13/sainsburys-christmas-sales-better-than-expected\">Sainsbury's Christmas sales better than expected</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Coupe said about 40% of shoppers bought goods from Sainsbury\u2019s and Argos and that the success of 10 Argos concessions already in Sainsbury\u2019s stores showed there was no clash between the brands.</p> <p>Coupe said: \u201cThis is one of the myths that seems to be constantly peddled. There is a slight difference [in the groups\u2019 customers] but it\u2019s pretty marginal. When you talk to customers in shops they get this. They think it\u2019s delightfully simples and makes life easier.\u201d</p> <p>He said Sainsbury\u2019s expected shareholders to get behind the deal, which he argued was not risky because Sainsbury\u2019s already sells general merchandise such as clothes, homewares and appliances. Sainsbury\u2019s also believes it can sell its successful <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2013/jun/24/sainsbury-tu-clothing-fast-fashion\">Tu clothing</a> range via Argos.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s has kept the cost of the deal relatively low byrefinancing Home Retail\u2019s \u00a3600m customer loan book, which will move into Sainsbury\u2019s bank generating cash for the retail arm of the business. Once cash on Home Retail\u2019s balance sheet is also taken into account, Sainsbury\u2019s said it would be getting the core Argos business for just \u00a3250m net.</p> <p>Coupe said Sainsbury\u2019s would close some Argos stores but that it would also open Argos branches within Sainsbury\u2019s shops and that he expected more people to be employed by Argos as a result. There will be job cuts from combiningsome head office operations, but the businesses are unlikely to move into one building, he said.</p> <p>Home Retail shares closed little changed at 153p and Sainsbury\u2019s shares were up just over 2% to 250.5p.</p>",

      "bodyText": "TalkTalk lost 101,000 customers and suffered costs of \u00a360m as a result of a cyber-attack on the company in October, but said business was returning to normal. The telecoms company said the net loss of customers in the three months to the end of December reflected fewer connections and greater \u201cchurn\u201d as customers chose to leave. But revenue increased 1.8% in the period, the third quarter of TalkTalk\u2019s financial year. TalkTalk\u2019s computer systems were hacked in October in what was originally feared to be a mass raid on customers\u2019 personal data. The attack proved to be less successful than first believed, with about 4% of the company\u2019s 4 million customers affected and no financial loss incurred by customers despite the partial disclosure of payment details. But customers were left fuming by the company\u2019s handling of the attack in its early stages and its seemingly slack security systems. TalkTalk refused to let people terminate contracts without incurring charges, and instead offered them a free upgrade, which almost half a million customers took up. TalkTalk gained fewer customers than expected following the attack because it closed down online sales operations, and the cost of the disruption in the third quarter was about \u00a315m, it said in a trading statement. There were also exceptional costs of \u00a340m-\u00a345m, taking the total bill for the attack to \u00a360m. Dido Harding, TalkTalk\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIt is encouraging to see the business returning to normal after a challenging quarter that was dominated by the cyberattack. Both churn and new connections recovered during December and January and independent external research have revealed that customers believe that we acted in their best interests.\u201d The company said earnings before interest, tax and other items for the year ending in March would be \u00a3255-\u00a3265m and that the dividend would increase by 15%. Before the trading update, analysts\u2019 average forecast was for earnings of \u00a3264m.",

      "body": "<p>TalkTalk lost 101,000 customers and suffered costs of \u00a360m as a result of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/22/talktalk-customer-data-hackers-website-credit-card-details-attack\">a cyber-attack</a> on the company in October, but said business was returning to normal. The telecoms company said the net loss of customers in the three months to the end of December reflected fewer connections and greater \u201cchurn\u201d as customers chose to leave. But revenue increased 1.8% in the period, the third quarter of TalkTalk\u2019s financial year.</p> <p>TalkTalk\u2019s computer systems were hacked in October in what was originally feared to be a mass raid on customers\u2019 personal data. The attack proved to be less successful than first believed, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/06/nearly-157000-had-data-breached-in-talktalk-cyber-attack\">with about 4% of the company\u2019s 4 million customers</a> affected and no financial loss incurred by customers despite the partial disclosure of payment details.</p> <p>But customers were left fuming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/23/talktalk-criticised-for-poor-security-and-handling-of-hack-attack\">by the company\u2019s handling of the attack in its early stages</a> and its seemingly slack security systems. TalkTalk refused to let people terminate contracts without incurring charges, and instead offered them a free upgrade, which almost half a million customers took up.</p> <p>TalkTalk gained fewer customers than expected following the attack because it closed down online sales operations, and the cost of the disruption in the third quarter was about \u00a315m, it said in a trading statement. There were also exceptional costs of \u00a340m-\u00a345m, taking the total bill for the attack to \u00a360m.</p> <p>Dido Harding, TalkTalk\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIt is encouraging to see the business returning to normal after a challenging quarter that was dominated by the cyberattack. Both churn and new connections recovered during December and January and independent external research have revealed that customers believe that we acted in their best interests.\u201d</p> <p>The company said earnings before interest, tax and other items for the year ending in March would be \u00a3255-\u00a3265m and that the dividend would increase by 15%. Before the trading update, analysts\u2019 average forecast was for earnings of \u00a3264m.</p> <p> </p>",

      "bodyText": "With crude continuing to fall and a $6.5bn loss and job cuts at BP, resource companies are leading the market lower again. Fears about a global slowdown have re-emerged, with disappointing manufacturing data on Monday from China, Europe and the US. That has helped push oil prices lower again, as has the lack of any progress from Opec and others on cutting production to stem the supply glut. But with the FTSE 100 falling below 6000 again, there are some bright spots. Hikma is 60p or nearly 3% higher at \u00a320.89 after a positive note on the pharmaceutical group from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. The bank has moved from neutral to buy, saying there should be substantial benefits from its purchase of Roxane Laboratories. It expected the company to shut either its own or Roxane\u2019s US generics manufacturing plant. Sainsbury has added 7.9p to 252.5p following confirmation of its \u00a31.3bn offer for Argos owner Home Retail Group, 0.9p better at 153.8p. The dominant factor in the market so far however is once again the commodity sector. The FTSE 100 is down 87.03 points at 5973.07, with BP leading the fallers with a 26.65p or 7% slump to 340.30p after its disappointing results. Poor UK construction data has not helped sentiment. With Brent crude down 1.5% at $33.71, BHP Billiton is down 37.6p at 640.5p. Anglo American has fallen 12.7p to 261.35p and Rio Tinto is 64.5p lower at 1631.5p. BHP has not been helped by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s cutting its rating from A+ to A and placed the mining group on negative watch due to challenging conditions for iron ore, oil and copper prices. Among the mid-caps, Tullow Oil is down 10.4p at 160.8p after Nomura cut its price target from 185p to 150p. The bank\u2019s analysts said: We maintain a reduce rating for the following reasons: 1) we see the valuation risk-reward on a mid-cycle oil price range of $60-$70 a barrel as not particularly compelling (downside of 40% versus upside of 15%) in the context of weaker near-term prices and our bearish industry outlook...; 2) the high reinvestment risk and large contribution of East Africa to our net asset value (94p on $60 a barrel); and 3) the perception that reducing the debt balance (around $4.9bn for 2016 on $30 a barrel) will squeeze equity value as investments are reduced or deferred. Short-term, the focus remains on managing the balance sheet. Our estimates suggest that debt covenants will come under pressure through 2016 with net debt at 5-6 times EBITDAX [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and exploration] assuming $30-40 a barrel, even with the benefits of around $600m hedging gain. Although we expect lending banks to be flexible through 2016/17, we see cost reduction, the delivery of first oil at TEN [offshore Ghana] and asset sales as necessary to deleverage meaningfully in the near term. But TalkTalk is up 17.6p at 235.5p as the telecoms group reported reassuring results after last year\u2019s cyber attack.",
