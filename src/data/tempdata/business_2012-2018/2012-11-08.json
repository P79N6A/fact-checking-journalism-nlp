    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Aviva warned on Thursday that it would take a big loss on the sale of its US life insurance and annuities arm, which forms a key part of a shake-up aimed at boosting the insurer's flagging share price. John McFarlane, the new chairman, set out a radical restructuring plan in July, which includes selling off or winding down 16 underperforming businesses \u2013 almost a third of group's operations \u2013 and improving the performance of 27 others. McFarlane, a banker who headed Australia and New Zealand Banking Group for a decade, has been running Aviva since shareholders, frustrated by the group's poor share price performance, ousted chief executive Andrew Moss in May after a row over executive pay. McFarlane said the sale of the US division, which was bought just before the financial crisis erupted in 2006, would be at a \"substantial discount\" to its book value of \u00a32.4bn, and would happen \"reasonably soon\". \"We would expect shareholders in general to support it,\" he added. The value of the US arm was already written down by \u00a3876m in August. It is expected to sell for little more than $1bn, but the sale would also free up more than \u00a31bn of capital, analysts say. Aviva is said to have received bids from Guggenheim Partners, an American privately owned financial services firm, and US private equity houses Apollo Global Management and Harbinger Capital Partners. McFarlane, who has vowed to only stay in areas \"where we can win,\" admitted that it had taken longer than expected to get the group restructuring off the ground. But Aviva said the search for a new chief executive was on track, with internal and external candidates being interviewed by Aviva's non-executive directors this week. The board expects to make an appointment early in the new year, with finance chief Pat Regan seen as a strong candidate. The US life and annuities division is one of the 16 units on the block. Aviva has also pulled out of Sri Lanka and sold down its stake in Dutch insurer Delta Lloyd. It plans to sell another eight businesses next year and take \"radical action\" in five others, such as taking capital out or winding them down. Its decision to pull out of the large-scale bulk annuity market in the UK earlier in the year is one example. Investec analyst Kevin Ryan expects the eight smaller businesses to be sold for book value. Barrie Cornes, at Panmure Gordon, said: \"Aviva remains a work in progress and we can understand nervousness of potential investors, but at the same time we view the valuation as compelling.\" Sliding sales highlighted the challenges faced by McFarlane in turning the business around. Sales at Aviva, which sells home and car insurance along with life and savings policies across Europe, dropped 5% to \u00a328.9bn in the first nine months of the year, with UK sales flat at \u00a38bn. Life and pensions sales were down 10% to \u00a318.8bn, with only Singapore and the US showing growth. New business sales in the troubled markets of Ireland, Spain, Italy and Poland all fell by more than 30%.",

Stretching across several days, a team of partners led by London-based Michael \"Woody\" Sherwood are deciding upon whom to bestow the glittering title of Goldman Sachs partner.</p> <p>The decision comes at the end of a thorough, secretive and sometimes brutal decision-making process that happens only every two years.

It also brings vast wealth in the form of a partnership bonus pool that pays out millions of dollars each year.

Annual payouts can reach tens of millions of dollars \u2013 each \u2013 on top of annual salaries which are thought to start at almost $1m.

Graduates are hired as analysts while business school graduates come in as associates. The next rung is vice-president \u2013 the level attained by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/14/goldman-sachs-director-quits-morally-bankrupt\" title=\"\">the disgruntled former employee Greg Smith</a> who has just written a book about the hard-nosed culture of the bank \u2013 which is known as executive director in London. Then comes managing director \u2013 and there are hundreds of them \u2013 and ultimately partner managing director, the highest level of the firm.</p> <p>Sherwood, a partner since 1994 who can still recall the brief but crucial call he took 18 years ago summoning him into the elite group, describes how partners are given the job of interviewing their fellow partners to discuss candidates put forward by divisional heads. The partner selected to cross-ruff is always drawn from another part of the firm, possibly even in another part of the world. No stone is left unturned \u2014 every aspect of their career to date is scrutinised \u2014 the deals they have worked on, the profit they have generated and the way they are regarded by their colleagues and staff.</p> <p>The process, which Cohan believes was formalised by former Goldman banker and existing board member Stephen Friedman, continues even though the firm was floated on the stock market in 1999 and is no longer a partnership in the conventional sense. But the idea of partnership was retained \"to maintain various core aspects of the firm's partnership culture among its leaders, including teamwork, client focus and a commitment to excellence\".</p> <p>To those inside the firm, the status is much more than just a job title. \"The idea of having a partnership within a public company is quite literally brilliant,\" said one partner, who has now stepped aside. This year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/05/goldman-sachs-cuts-partners\" title=\"\">33 partners have departed</a>, leaving the total at 407 before the new crop \u2013 or \"class\" as Sherwood describes them \u2013 are appointed next week. Those who leave the partnership \u2013 often only in their late 40s and early 50s \u2013 go on to other careers, retire or stay on as advisory or senior directors. Some even join the board, such as is the case of the outgoing chief financial officer David Viniar.</p> <p>In 2010 Blankfein made calls to 110 new partners. This year he may not spend so much time on the phone: the precise number of new appointments is still being worked on, but at a time when the firm has been cutting staff to save costs, it is likely that the 2012 \"class\" will be fewer than 100, with speculation that between 75 and 100 Goldman bankers will make the grade.</p> <p>An aspiring partner describes how the \"process is intense\".</p> <p>\"It's a brilliant process but it is a reasonably odd one because as a candidate you don't have an interview. No one talks about it but everyone knows you are up for it. People are asking questions about you but you are having zero involvement.\"</p> <p>Cross-ruffing allows comparisons to be made. Rankings given to candidates by the department heads are cross-matched against those drawn up by the partners leading the assessment process. Differences are sometimes exposed. Sherwood stressed that it \"is not about how you did any one year\".</p> <p>And, if the process of being named a partner sounds gruelling, getting a foot on the ladder lower down the firm is tough too. Even though many investment bankers are now often ashamed to say what they do in polite company, and Goldman is often portrayed as the epitome of all that is wrong in the financial world, it is a still an organisation that ambitious people scramble to join. Goldman's annual report reveals that almost 300,000 applied for jobs in 2010 and 2011. Fewer than 4% were hired \"and though most had multiple offers, nearly nine out of 10 people offered a job accepted\".</p> <p>Cohan writes in his book that candidates can be subjected to 30 interviews and describes Goldman as a place that is not for \"prima donnas\" but \"stuffed to the gills with high-achieving alpha males\".</p> <p>Each year there is a formal assessment process. Staff are subjected to a 360-degree review, where they are rated and assessed by their peers, subordinates and superiors.</p> <p>These assessments are resurfaced during the final selection process in the promotion to partner. Few are hired from outside at partner level, although these so-called \"lateral\" hires can hope for fast-track promotion.</p> <p>The easy solution would be to select those who generate the most revenue for the firm. This is what Smith suggested when he resigned from Goldman and penned an excoriating attack on the firm and its culture in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/opinion/why-i-am-leaving-goldman-sachs.html\" title=\"\">New York Times</a>. \"Today, if you make enough money for the firm (and are not currently an ax [sic] murderer) you will be promoted into a position of influence,\" he wrote.</p> <p>Sherwood disagrees. In his view the partnership is something far more altruistic: \"It is often about doing something that is good for the whole firm, to make the firm better and subduing your individual motivation and aspirations for the good of the whole firm.\"</p> <p>Acting for the good of the partnership is a prerequisite once membership of the exclusive club has been attained. The average tenure of a partner is eight years. As Cohan puts it: \"It's very good for the junior people.\"</p> <p>Viniar reckons that 20% leave every other year. But it is not just a benevolent act to encourage younger bankers. It is also about the bonus pool that exists for the partners. The prospectus accompanying the 1999 flotation <a href=\"shttp://www.goldmansachs.com/s/prospectus/Business.html\" title=\"\">described the process</a>: \"Upon selection to the partner compensation plan, participants will be allocated a percentage interest in a pool for annual bonus payments in addition to base salaries. The size of the pool will be established by the partner compensation plan committee annually, taking into account our results of operations and other measures of financial performance.\"</p> <p>In 2009, in the wake of the financial crisis, the 100 London-based partners decided they needed to demonstrate that they understood public anger with the banking sector \u2013 so they capped their pay and bonuses at \u00a31m each. But that was a one-off.</p> <p>Sherwood insists that the partners' bonuses are handed out after the wider bonus pool is agreed and that the process of becoming a partner is a meritocracy: \"Some are great leaders, some drive the organisation, others are just incredibly productive people or are building new businesses. Some are lateral hires. There is no particular person, there is no particular nationality, race, region or gender. It's a collection of very motivated, very diverse people who come from all types of different backgrounds.\"</p> <p>\"If you talk to the candidates it is a very aspirational process,\" Sherwood said, acknowledging that it also means that some hoping to become partners will not make it.</p> <p>Those aspiring partners who pick up their phones next week and hear not Blankfein's New York tones but, perhaps, the more familiar voice of their divisional boss on the end, will know their time has not come. Some will walk. But others, as Sherwood puts it, \"will go back to their desk, and work hard\" and try again in two years' time.</p>",

In his view the partnership is something far more altruistic: \"It is often about doing something that is good for the whole firm, to make the firm better and subduing your individual motivation and aspirations for the good of the whole firm.\" Acting for the good of the partnership is a prerequisite once membership of the exclusive club has been attained. The average tenure of a partner is eight years. As Cohan puts it: \"It's very good for the junior people.\" Viniar reckons that 20% leave every other year. But it is not just a benevolent act to encourage younger bankers. It is also about the bonus pool that exists for the partners. The prospectus accompanying the 1999 flotation described the process: \"Upon selection to the partner compensation plan, participants will be allocated a percentage interest in a pool for annual bonus payments in addition to base salaries. The size of the pool will be established by the partner compensation plan committee annually, taking into account our results of operations and other measures of financial performance.\" In 2009, in the wake of the financial crisis, the 100 London-based partners decided they needed to demonstrate that they understood public anger with the banking sector \u2013 so they capped their pay and bonuses at \u00a31m each. But that was a one-off. Sherwood insists that the partners' bonuses are handed out after the wider bonus pool is agreed and that the process of becoming a partner is a meritocracy: \"Some are great leaders, some drive the organisation, others are just incredibly productive people or are building new businesses. Some are lateral hires. There is no particular person, there is no particular nationality, race, region or gender. It's a collection of very motivated, very diverse people who come from all types of different backgrounds.\" \"If you talk to the candidates it is a very aspirational process,\" Sherwood said, acknowledging that it also means that some hoping to become partners will not make it. Those aspiring partners who pick up their phones next week and hear not Blankfein's New York tones but, perhaps, the more familiar voice of their divisional boss on the end, will know their time has not come. Some will walk. But others, as Sherwood puts it, \"will go back to their desk, and work hard\" and try again in two years' time.",

There was little help from the Bank of England or European Central Bank, which both left interest rates on hold, while late reports of another delay in granting Greece its latest tranche of bailout money also dampened enthusiasm.</p> <p>A number of companies disappointed investors with their trading news, including <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong>, down 10.4p at 284.6p as lower metal prices sent its nine month revenues sharply lower, <strong>Land Securities</strong>, 16.5p lower at 794.5p, <strong>Tate and Lyle</strong>, off 4p at 730p, and <strong>Morrisons</strong>, down 4p at 263.5p.</p> <p><strong>Balfour Beatty</strong> was a major casualty, down 55.9p at 250.1p as the infrastructure group issued a profit warning.</p> <p>But pharmaceutical group <strong>BTG</strong> jumped 24.8p to 352.4p after it confirmed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/oct/03/astrazeneca-first-group-west-coast?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">a previous update</a> that it had seen strong demand for its snake anti-venom and cancer drugs. Half year revenues climbed 30% to \u00a3143.4m, with profit up 44% to \u00a318.3m.</p> <p><strong>SuperGroup</strong>, the fashion retailer behind the Superdry brand, added 6.8p to 146p after its second quarter sales jumped 20.3%, helped by cooler weather. The company said it was well positioned ahead of the peak Christmas trading period, and was on track to meet City expectations for the full year. Panmure Gordon analyst Jean Roche said:</p> <blockquote> Following a strong second quarter (August-October) trading statement and fresh evidence that new additions to the management team are having a significant positive effect on the operating performance of the company, we are upgrading Supergroup to buy from hold and raising our price target to 750p from 662p. </blockquote> <p>Jonathan Pritchard at Oriel Securities kept his hold recommendation, saying:</p> <blockquote> The second quarter saw solid retail like for like sales growth and represents another step towards rebuilding management credibility. Clearance of old and third party stock means lower gross margins in the second quarter, so there's no change to forecasts. The shares are up with events after their strong run. </blockquote> <p><strong>Cable &amp; Wireless Communications</strong>, which is in the process of selling a number of its businesses, closed 2.07p higher at 38p after first half earnings inched up around 2%. Will Draper at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> As we expected CWC's first half results show slight operational weakness, particularly in Panama, although a pension credit has supported the company's full year EBITDA guidance which has been reiterated.

      "bodyText": "Amid a plethora of corporate updates, leading shares failed to regain any ground after Wednesday's sell-off. The FTSE 100 finished 15.58 points lower at 5776.05 as worries about America's forthcoming fiscal cliff - tax rises and spending cuts- as well as eurozone woes continued to trouble investors. There was little help from the Bank of England or European Central Bank, which both left interest rates on hold, while late reports of another delay in granting Greece its latest tranche of bailout money also dampened enthusiasm. A number of companies disappointed investors with their trading news, including Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, down 10.4p at 284.6p as lower metal prices sent its nine month revenues sharply lower, Land Securities, 16.5p lower at 794.5p, Tate and Lyle, off 4p at 730p, and Morrisons, down 4p at 263.5p. Balfour Beatty was a major casualty, down 55.9p at 250.1p as the infrastructure group issued a profit warning. But pharmaceutical group BTG jumped 24.8p to 352.4p after it confirmed a previous update that it had seen strong demand for its snake anti-venom and cancer drugs. Half year revenues climbed 30% to \u00a3143.4m, with profit up 44% to \u00a318.3m. SuperGroup, the fashion retailer behind the Superdry brand, added 6.8p to 146p after its second quarter sales jumped 20.3%, helped by cooler weather. The company said it was well positioned ahead of the peak Christmas trading period, and was on track to meet City expectations for the full year. Panmure Gordon analyst Jean Roche said: Following a strong second quarter (August-October) trading statement and fresh evidence that new additions to the management team are having a significant positive effect on the operating performance of the company, we are upgrading Supergroup to buy from hold and raising our price target to 750p from 662p. Jonathan Pritchard at Oriel Securities kept his hold recommendation, saying: The second quarter saw solid retail like for like sales growth and represents another step towards rebuilding management credibility. Clearance of old and third party stock means lower gross margins in the second quarter, so there's no change to forecasts. The shares are up with events after their strong run. Cable &amp; Wireless Communications, which is in the process of selling a number of its businesses, closed 2.07p higher at 38p after first half earnings inched up around 2%. Will Draper at Espirito Santo said: As we expected CWC's first half results show slight operational weakness, particularly in Panama, although a pension credit has supported the company's full year EBITDA guidance which has been reiterated. CWC has confirmed discussions to sell Monaco &amp; Islands and Macau are still \"ongoing\" but there is no further detail at this stage. Disappointingly a change in Panama tax legislation results in $45m additional cash outflow this year and so net debt is higher than expected. As we still believe CWC's assets are significantly undervalued compared with the value implied by the current share price, we reiterate our buy rating and fair value of 45p. Back with the FTSE 100, G4S dropped 8.4p to 259.2p as the security group paid the price for its failure to provide enough staff for the London Olympics. It has missed out on a number of UK prison contracts, and has been told HMP Wolds which it manages, will be returned to the public sector. But Burberry added 15p to \u00a312.14 as it recovered some of Wednesday's fall following its latest update. Defence group Chemring lost 15.2p to 242.8p after Wednesday's news that US private equity predator Carlyle was not planning to bid. Analyst Rami Myerson at UBS said: We had assumed there was a low probability for a bid following two profit warnings and a surprise change in [Chemring's] chief executive.

(2) What is the sensitivity of Chemring's revenues and profits to an extended continuing resolution or US sequestration? Lower down the market, Speedy Hire rose 1.25p to 34.25p on vague talk of a possible 60p a share bid, with US groups United Rentals and UPS mentioned as well as, yes, private equity. Finally Mears added 3p to 293.75p as the company paid \u00a324m for Morrison Facilities Services, part of Anglian Water.

Here's a breakdown of who will win, and who will lose, over the next three months \u2013 regardless of whether we actually avoid the fiscal cliff. </p> <h2>Winners</h2> <p><strong>The Republican leadership,</strong> led by House speaker John Boehner, are fighting to get spending cuts and tax breaks for high earners. Regardless of whether they carry the day, the Republicans are setting the agenda for this fight. As the holdouts, they're the ones who will determine how long, and how ugly, the fight over the fiscal cliff will get, just as Republicans held the cards in the debt ceiling fight last year. Democratic leaders have already started begging for a smaller fight. Max Baucus, chairman of Senate finance committee, called Wednesday for compromise on the fiscal cliff issue. Senate majority leader Harry Reid pleaded on TV: \"Everything doesn't have to be a fight. Everything doesn't have to be a fight, but that's the way it's been the past couple of years.\"</p> <p><strong>American companies </strong>have been worried about the fiscal cliff for the better part of the year, so they have cushions to keep them going. Peter Falvey, an investment banker and founder of tech-industry advisory firm Falvey Partners, said executives have learned to live with worry about the fiscal cliff. \"There's a general fear that we're facing a big problem. No one I talk to has the confidence that the current political infrastructure is going to address it well. It's almost paralyzing in a way. The stock market is going to tank, confidence is going to be impacted, and you're almost certainly going to go into a recession.\" This is a grim outlook, true. But American companies have been, by and large, preparing for it by cutting their business spending and hoarding cash. Many companies are better prepared than you might think.</p> <p><strong>People earning more than $250,000 a year: </strong>There aren't too many issues on which the 1% are finding themselves highly supported this year. With the defeat of Mitt Romney, a whole host of business- and wealth-advancing policies will never see the light of day. The last issue on which any politician is openly willing to go to the mat is the one of keeping tax cuts for the wealthy. The Bush tax cuts reduced taxes for all Americans; as part of the discussions on the deficit, President Obama wants to exclude the wealthy from those tax cuts. The Republican leadership, starting with John Boehner, seem as if they would be more willing to cut off their arms than concede on those tax cuts. It ain't much, but it's the last little legislative wet kiss that politicians are publicly giving to the interests of the rich. </p> <h2>Losers</h2> <p><strong>The US economy: </strong>There is no alternative world where going off the fiscal cliff would be a positive development for the tentative recovery in the US. The Congressional Budget Office in Washington has estimated that the planned tax increases and spending cuts would reduce US gross domestic product by 4% in 2013. The National Association of Manufacturers has an even more dire prediction, expecting a loss of 6 million jobs and an unemployment rate of 11% within a year. Mohamed El-Erian, a leading investor with Pimco who is an influential commentator on financial issues, predicted the US will plunge into recession if the fiscal cliff isn't addressed. </p> <p><strong>Democrats:</strong> There is no question that a deal will be reached, as JP Morgan Funds chief global strategist David Kelly told me Wednesday. \"There's an early deal, a just-in-time deal or a late deal. But there's a deal.\" An early deal, meaning one in early December, would be preferable for Democrats, who hold the White House and the Senate and are, by default, in charge of turning around the economy. But the two other options \u2013 a just-in-time deal just around New Year's Eve and a too-late deal in the New Year \u2013 would be disastrous for the economy and, by extension, the Democrats. The Democrats also have the job of convincing the Republicans to let go of fiscal beliefs they have held on to strongly for well over a year \u2013 a daunting task. Barclays Capital said Wednesday \"unless the Republican House pro-actively agrees to concessions (or the president offers to compromise on high income tax rates), the chances of the cliff temporarily hitting are high\". That's a lot of pressure on Democrats. </p> <p><strong>Investors</strong>: Barclays Capital warned its clients this week that the fiscal cliff will be a bigger problem for the markets than many expect.

That means the markets will go up and down like a roller coaster, and it will be hard to hold on. Volatility, for investors, has largely been a bad sign; it makes the markets panicky and unpredictable. \"What about the chances of a longer-term grand bargain that avoids the fiscal cliff? We believe that there is not enough time to come to such a comprehensive agreement before the end of the year,\" Barclays warned. \"What about the prospect of a temporary extension of all expiring provisions for six months or so, while a grand bargain is negotiated? This is not out of the question, but we will not know until late December.\"</p> <p>Leon LaBrecque, the founder of money-management firm LJPR, with $470m under assets, laid out the risk of the fiscal cliff for investors Wednesday. It was grim, and he told investors to watch their portfolios and their wallets. \"The fiscal cliff is \u2013 simply put \u2013 the biggest tax increase/spending cut in history.

The latest jobs figures came as a rebound in exports drove down the US's trade deficit. The US deficit in international trade of goods and services in September was $41.55bn, down 5.1% from $43.79bn the month before, the commerce department said. The economic news came after a sharp sell-off on Wall Street on Wednesday, the first day of trading following Obama's election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 312 points (2.36%) as investors worried about a looming fight over fiscal policy in Washington, given the Republican's hold on the House of Representatives. On Thursday morning, the Dow opened slightly up.",

      "bodyText": "European markets have closed and any hope of a rally following Wednesday's sell off has been squashed. With talk of another delay to Greece receiving its latest tranche of aid adding to US fiscal cliff worries, the general trend is down, even if only marginally. \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished down 0.27% \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 0.39% \u2022 France's Cac has closed 0.06% lower \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is off 0.064% \u2022 Spain's Ibex has slipped 0.48% \u2022 And in Greece, the Athens market has dropped 3.77% On that note, we'll close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow. The IMF has called on Europe to continue moving towards a complete monetary union including a banking union and greater fiscal integration: In the euro area, robust action and follow-through are required on multiple fronts. Sovereigns under stress need to continue to adjust and request appropriate EFSF/ESM support if needed; and support for them and their banks provided via the ESM would relieve funding pressures and break the adverse feedback loops between sovereigns and banks. Meanwhile, the ECB\u2019s commitment to act on secondary markets via the OMT is critical to address elevated risk premia due to convertibility concerns within the euro area, while maintaining a very accommodative monetary policy should support demand. Anti-crisis measures need to be anchored by a vision of\u2014as well as a reasonably fast and tangible progress toward\u2014a more complete monetary union, supported by a banking union and greater fiscal integration. Access to funding at reasonable costs is essential to allow economies to adjust successfully. While economies in the periphery must continue to adjust their fiscal balances at a pace they can bear, in the current fragile environment, putting in place the right policies may not be sufficient to fully restore the confidence of markets, not least because of implementation risks. And here's more talk about possible Greek measures, this time courtesy of the Wall Street Journal: As European markets head towards their close, here's Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads: The FTSE looks like it is just about to eke out a gain following the tumultuous decline yesterday in a move that hardly inspires confidence and in fact at the time of writing the index is now in negative territory. Few buyers were tempted back into the market today and investors were not helped much either by central bank meetings where there was the glimmer of hope that further stimulus might be provided by the ECB or the BOE, but unfortunately nothing was forthcoming. Risk assets were also out of favour following a successful Spanish bond auction which made the likelihood of any bailout for the country in the near term even slimmer. The markets have been very clear in giving the message that they want to see the country receive formal aid from the European Union; however it is now very unlikely it\u2019ll happen this year and could be a while into the New Year if it ever comes. Uh oh. Some unwelcome snaps on Greece: \u2022 EU MINISTERS TO DELAY GREEK AID CALL FOR WEEKS, OFFICIAL SAYS \u2022 GREEK AID TRANCHE DECISION DATE SEEN POSSIBLE ON NOV. 26 \u2022 EU DECISION ON GREEK AID PAYMENT AWAITING TROIKA REPORT The full story is here on Bloomberg with the unnamed official saying that there will be no call to release the \u20ac31.5bn tranche of funds when finance ministers meet on 12 November. The final troika report will apparently not be ready by then, only a preliminary version which will not be enough for ministers to make their decision. The problem is Greece is rapidly running out of money, so further delays are not helpful. After yesterday's parliamentary approval of proposed reforms, Sunday will see a vote on the 2013 Budget. Meanwhile here's a piece from Reuters analysing the tensions within the troika on Greece's requirements. A day or so after President Obama's re-election come some reasonable economic numbers from the US. Weekly jobless claims dropped 8,000 to 355,000, better than the 370,000 figures forecast by a Reuters poll. Hurricane Sandy had an impact - some states saw people put out of work but in others claims were reduced because power cuts meant the state could not collect the necessary forms. Meanwhile the US trade deficit narrowed in September as exports increased. Still, this has not exactly helped Wall Street. After Wednesday's slump, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost ground again and is currently down around 15 points. Still on the new banknote, in mythology Europa was seduced by Zeus in the form of a bull and ended up as the first queen of Crete. Some have suggested that an abducted woman may not be the best image to use given the recent criticism of the ECB's gender policy. Still, things could have been worse: A new euro-denominated bank note unveiled by Draghi is attracting some comment. Features figure from Greek mythology called Europa. Am handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher now There are no signs of regret on Wall Street after yesterday's panicky-looking sell-off. The Dow Jones average was up 1 point at 12.933.73 That's the view of Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight, who thinks an absence of inflation worries will embolden the ECB to act. Possibly next month. With the Eurozone facing a difficult fourth quarter after almost certainly suffering further GDP contraction in the third quarter, and with the underlying inflation situation in the Eurozone looking far from alarming, we believe that the ECB will take interest rates down from 0.75% to 0.50% sooner rather than later. We have pencilled in an interest rate cut from 0.75% to 0.50% in December. However, it is very possible that the ECB could delay trimming interest rates until early 2013 due to concerns that the impact of a near-term cut could be diluted by the problems in monetary policy transmission channels. In the wake of the European Central Bank's decision to keep rates on hold, leaving the main rate at 0.75%, ECB president Mario Draghi has offered little cause for cheer at his press conference: The eurozone is \"expected to remain weak\" Inflation is \"likely to remain above 2 percent for the remainder of 2012\" because of high energy prices and hikes in indirect taxes in some parts of the currency union. The should fall next year. The pace of monetary expansion \"continues to be subdued\" He did allow himself a little pat on the back, however, over the impact on the markets of his threat that the ECB might resort to so-called Outright Monetary Transactions: Economic activity in the euro area is expected to remain weak although it continues to be supported by our monetary policy stance and financial market confidence has visibly improved on the back of our decisions as regards Outright Monetary Transactions. In line with most expectations the Bank of England have elected not to inject more electronic money into the economy, despite continuing worries over anaemic growth. There was not change to interest rates, also as expected. There had been increasingly strong scepticism from the Bank as to the effectiveness of quantitative easing, as well as concerns among some members of the monetary policy committee about the threat of rush of inflation. The central bank has already spent \u00a3375bn on gilt purchases. Less than a month ago, economists polled by Reuters suggested there was a 60% chance the Bank would today unveil another round of quantitative easing. Greek unemployment continues to climb, reaching 25.4%. That's just over double the eurozone average. The jobless rate for those between 15 and 24 is now 58%. In total, some 1.27m Greeks were not in employment in August, according to the country's statistical service Elstat. Austerity steps narrowly passed by the parliament is likely to push numbers on welfare higher still. The European Commission expects a modest recovery in 2014. And by that, they mean a jobless rate of 22%. Amazingly Greece is still not Europe's unemployment capital as Spain has recored a jobless rate of 25.5%. A glimmer of good news from across the Irish sea. New mortgage numbers in Ireland have risen, year-on-year, for the first time since 2006. The boost has been attributed at least in part to mortgage interest relief offered to first-time buyers if they purchase a home by the end of the year. Close to 4,000 new home loans were issued in the three months to the end of September \u2014 a rise of 10% compared with the same period a year ago. Having experienced one of Europe's biggest property bubbles, house prices in Ireland have halved since 2008 when several of country's banks sank into crisis and the government was forced to seek an international bailout. While the number of new mortgages looked encouraging, the value of that lending was quite a different story, at just \u20ac663m. That's the highest in two years, but \u2014 to put it in perspective \u2014 some \u20ac40bn of annual mortgage lending took place in 2006. Spain has got its bond auction away! In fact, it sold more than the expected \u20ac3.5bn to \u20ac4.5bn. The average yield on its 2015 notes was 3.66%, compared with 3.956% achieved just over a month ago. Some \u20ac992m of these maturities went in the auction which saw strong demand. The biggest chunk of the sale was \u20ac3.04bn of five-year bonds, with an average yield of 4.68%. However, some \u20ac731m of longer-dated 2032 bonds were sold at an average yield of 6.32% \u2014 quite a step up in borrowing costs from last time Spain attempted this kind of issue. Still, with the auction behind it, the country now has the resources to meet its 2012 financing requirements without going cap in hand to the European authorities. In the wake of the Greek government finally passing its austerity measures amid riots in the streets, the Athens stock market has opened sharply lower this morning, writes our markets correspondent Nick Fletcher. The index has fallen 2.6% with the banking sector hit particularly hard, down more than 6%. Much of this is a catch-up, however, since the Greek markets had closed before the worst of yesterday's late rout, losing just 0.79%. The collapse was led by Wall Street - down 312 points - on fears about America's forthcoming tax rises and spending cuts, as well as another gloomy prognosis for the eurozone's economies from the European Commission. Elsewhere in Euope, the FTSE 100 is up 0.16%; Germany's DAX 30 is up 0.54%; France's CAC 40 is up 0.57%, Italy's FTSE MIB is down 0.63% and Spain's IBEX is down 0.54%. Some refreshing \u2014 if unsettling \u2014 candour from a former director of bailed out Spanish bank Bankia. Mercedes Rojo-Izquierdo, who joined the board at the end of 2010 and was paid \u20ac374,000 the following year, has admitted she \"didn't understand anything\" when presented with Bankia's 2011 accounts. The admission came as Ms Rojo appeared as a witness in at the National Criminal Court in Madrid, which is investigating alleged mismanagement at the bank. The bailout of Bankia is regarded as a major scandal in Spain. Part of the public anger has focused on board appointees, several of whom \u2014 like Ms Rojo \u2014 had a background in politics rather than finance. Ms Rojo came to Bankia from Caja Madrid, one of the seven regional banks merged to form the enlarged group. She is a former adviser to the Madrid regional government. She has qualifications in chemistry. The former Bankia director isn't the first bank director to admit they didn't have a handle on every detail. Remember former Royal Bank of Scotland investment banking boss Johnny Cameron? He told an investigation by the Financial Services Authority: I don't think, even at that point [May 2007, well after sub-prime problems had begun to spiral in the US] ... I had enough information. Brian [Crowe, my deputy] may have thought I understood more than I did ... And it's around this time that I became clearer on what CDOs were. Cameron settled with the FSA, agreeing not to pursue another post in the City. Any other examples of this kind of candour? Spain is holding a bond auction shortly (9.30am UK time). It is the first time the nation has tested appetite for its longer-term debt about 18 months. Spain is trying to sell between \u20ac3.5bn and \u20ac4.5bn of bonds, some three-year, but also bonds with five-year and 20-year maturities. The last time there was an attempt to sell such long-dated bonds was May last year. And the outlook has hardly got any rosier since. A successful auction would allow prime minister Mariano Rajoy welcome breathing space, giving him more time before he is again under real pressure to request a rescue package from Europe. Hope to have an update on the auction later today In the wake of Germany's growth forecast downward revisions from from the European Commission yesterday there is more bad news out of Europe's powerhouse economy as exports fell at their fastest pace since towards the end of 2011. Exports were down 2.5% according to data from the Federal Statistics Office. This compares with economists' forecasts of 1.5%, as polled by Reuters. Andreas Scheuerle at Dekabank suggests figures are a worry milestone. He tells Reuters: The debt crisis has arrived in Germany: At year-end 2012, weaker demand from abroad comes on top of uncertainty that has weighed on investments since the summer of 2011. Imports were also much lower than expected. Down 1.6% versus forecasts of a drop of 0.1%. Underlining the problem, German engineering group Siemens delivered its response to weakening global demand: a \u20ac6bn cost cutting programme running to 2014. France and Belgium have announced they are to pump a further \u20ac5.5bn into Dexia. This is almost the same amount as the two nations put into the ailing bank to bail it out at the height of the 2008 banking crisis. The latest move comes after Dexia reported another large loss and heavy writedowns. Belgium will stump up just over half of the capital injection - 53% to be precise \u2014 with France putting up the balance. The move come just over a year after Dexia was rescued for the second time since 2008. Obviously, the move adds to challenges both countries have in getting their deficits under control. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis, and other important events in the world economy. To recap: it was a busy day yesterday with the Greek parliament only narrowly approving the country\u2019s \u20ac13.5bn austerity package against a backdrop of street protests. In the wake of a US election the markets took a dive, in part as attention back to eurozone woes. The Dow Jones lost 312 points. As Larry Elliot sets out in stark terms, Barack Obama now has a narrow window of less than two months to broker a deal with a Republican-dominated house of representatives. Phillip Inman also has a useful Q&amp;A on the signficance of the fiscal cliff. The mood in the markets was not helped by deep cuts to EU growth forecasts from the European commission. Not even Germany escaped a downward revision. Today there are a flurry of news events any one of which could again test the markets: We will be looking at monetary policy decisions from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank. Before the start of this week expectations that the BoE might pump yet more electronic money into the economy had all but disappeared. Then came grim industrial and manufacturing surveys which have rekindled expectations in the eyes of some. There are also UK and US trade figures out Elsewhere, the Troika touch down in Cyprus to further discuss and EU bailout sought by the island in June.",

      "bodyText": "Security business G4S has lost out on a number of UK prison contracts, following its chaotic performance with the London 2012 Olympics. The company had hoped a series of recent new deals - including the management of electronic tagging in Scotland and running security checks at Olso airport - would put it in line for further UK government business despite its Olympics embarrassment. Earlier in the week G4S's chief executive Nick Buckles - famously grilled by MPs over the company's failure to provide enough staff for the Games - told Reuters: We hope this track record this year of starting new business will hold us in good stead for winning further government business, but clearly that remains to be seen. Buckles can certainly see now. The government had previously indicated it would take a company's performance into account when awarding contracts. Now the ministry of justice has said three prisons would remain under public sector management and HMP Wolds - currently run by G4S - would be removed from the private sector next July. Four other prisons are still in to be transferred to private bidders, with Sodexo, Serco and MIC/Amey in the running. The news has sent G4S shares tumbling 3.5%, down 9.6p to 258p, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. David Brockton at Espirito Santo said: As feared, G4S has failed to secure any new prisons and will not proceed to the next stage of bidding for any of the potential public sector prisons to be outsourced. Furthermore, G4S has also failed to re-secure its existing contract with HMP Wolds, which will now move back into the public sector.

The negative sentiment in Europe has soured the sweet taste of Obama\u2019s victory.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here are the closing prices:</p> <p><strong>FTSE 100: down 93 points at 5791, - 1.58%</strong></p> <p><strong>German DAX: down 2%</strong></p> <p><strong>French CAC: down 2.5%</strong></p> <p><strong>Spanish IBEX: down 2%</strong></p> <p><strong>Italian FTSE MIB: down 2.5%</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-07T16:44:34.726Z\">at 4.44pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-509a8bb995cb1506d2444ad0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-07T16:26:33.429Z\">4.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Video from Athens</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a short video clip shot in Syntagma Square a little while ago</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCUejnSm87s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kCUejnSm87s?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-07T16:27:11.489Z\">at 4.27pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-509a8a0c95cb1506d2444acd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-07T16:19:24.355Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Estimates for the number of people assembled outside the Athens parliament and the surrounding area range from 60,000 to 100,000.</p> <p>There have also been reports that the police are 'controlling' the situation by restricting access to many roads in Athens.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-07T16:27:04.577Z\">at 4.27pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-509a896795cb1506d2444acb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-07T16:16:39.532Z\">4.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">More photos from Athens</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a selection of the best photos from protesters in Syntagma this evening, via Twitter:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/northaura/status/266207707952988160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>In front of the parliament <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Athens\">#Athens</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Greece\">#Greece</a> now <a href=\"http://t.co/E8aXB1Do\" title=\"http://twitter.com/Jaquoutopie/status/266204724259340290/photo/1\">twitter.com/Jaquoutopie/st\u2026</a> @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaquoutopie\">jaquoutopie</a> estimates 100,000 people already there<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%237ngr\">#7ngr</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23rbnews\">#rbnews</a></p>&mdash;

And it is the crisis of confidence in some euro area countries that is causing safe-haven flows of money into Germany, depressing interest rates even further.</p> <p>This highlights the fact that countries in a single currency area are connected like communicating vessels. A change in one vessel creates an equal change in all the others.</p> </blockquote> <p>He then cited the steady increase in Germany's claims on TARGET2 (the system used to handle liabilities between central banks across the eurozone):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As interest rates rise in countries in difficulty, they fall in strong countries like Germany. As TARGET2 liabilities increase in some countries due to capital outflows, TARGET2 claims increase in Germany due to capital inflows.</p> <p>Financial developments in Germany are the mirror-image of financial developments in the rest of the euro area. And this means that measures to ensure the stability of the euro area as a whole will also be to the benefit of Germany.</p> </blockquote> <p>And in conclusion, Draghi insisted that the ECB's recent actions will not threaten taxpayers or fuel inflation (two major fears in Germany).</p> <p>The full transcript <a href=\"http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2012/html/sp121107.en.html\">can be seen on the ECB website</a>:</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-07T13:17:56.623Z\">at 1.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-509a5a36b579f74bac764c79\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-07T12:55:18.747Z\">12.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Highlights from Olli Rehn's press conference</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Olli Rehn appeared to be in a pretty downbeat mood in this lunchtime's press conference (see previous post for the live video feed).</p> <p>Commissioner Rehn began by warning that Europe is going through a period of \"macro-economic adjustment\" which will not be finished for \"some time still\".</p> <p>He pointed to the latest lending data from the European Central Bank, which show a slight overall tightening of credit, and a fall in in demand for loans from companies and households</p> <p>He also said leaders must continue to rebalance their economies if they are to return to sustainable growth,</p> <p>Despite the grim message, there were also moments of mild levity:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LorcanRK/status/266156593790451712\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Rehn \"This graph shows the decomposition of the euro area..\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23lostintranslation\">#lostintranslation</a>?</p>&mdash;

      "bodyText": "It's time to stop today's live blog before we crash into tomorrow here in London. And what an exciting day it's been, with the Greek parliament narrowly approving the country's \u20ac13.5bn austerity package after a tense vote, a long debate, and occasional moments of farce in the Athens assembly. The vote took place after tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the Greek capital to protest about the package. Initially peaceful, the protests were marred by violent scenes and clashes between riot police and a small group of protesters. The ongoing eurozone crisis helped to send shares falling sharply in the financial markets, with the Dow Jones tumbling by 312 points. There were plenty of reasons to be gloomy -- the EC slashed its growth forecasts, German and Spanish industrial production data miss forecasts, and Mario Draghi warning that the European economy was in poor shape. Thanks for reading and commenting, as ever.... ...and I'm particularly grateful to those people in Athens who we've been quoting and referencing over the last couple of days. Good night! One last thing to flag up -- I mentioned at 5.54pm that there was a report that a small number of protesters tried to \"storm the parliament\" in Athens by breaking through the barriers outside. Joanna Kakissis, a reporter in Athens, tells me that she was outside the parliament and there was no attempt to storm it. Theodora Oikonomides says some protesters may have \"sought to go over the crowd control barriers\", but that this not a mass charge on the parliament. Hope that helps clarify the situation. Just before we go, here are a few photos showing the action in the Greek parliament during the climax of tonight's vote: Although it's 1am in Greece, some people still have the energy to comment on the narrow austerity vote. Here's a round-up: And here's some reaction from the UK too: Greek newspaper Kathimerini has a good write-up of the debate in the Athens parliament before tonight's vote: Greek Parliament passes new austerity package with tiny majority It points out that tonight's expulsions (see 10.26 GMT) means that the socialist Pasok party now only has 27 MPs -- down from 160 three years ago when it governed alone. Prime minister Antonis Samaras says the next challenge is Sunday night's vote on the budget, after tonight's austerity vote. Efthimia Efthimiou and Yannis Koutsomitis have the quotes: Greece's finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, was not getting carried away by tonight's narrow win. Speaking shortly after the vote was over, Stournaras said: The difficult part is starting now. The Greek parliament has now gone into recess until Thursday night. That's when debate will begin about the 2013 budget, with a vote scheduled for Sunday night. Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith confirms that Antonis Samaras's government secured 153 votes in favour of the austerity package. A total of 128 votes were cast against the proposal. The remainder of MPs abstained -- with 18 voting 'present' and one going absent. Already the political recriminations have started - with SEVEN government MPs being kicked out for failing to support the \u20ac13.5bn package of cuts. Six of the rebels were from the socialist Pasok party. Athens journalist Efthimia Efthimiou has the details: Greek officials are still counting the votes, but it looks as if a total of 153 votes were cast in favour of the austerity package. The Greek Government has just secured 151 votes -- the austerity bill WILL pass! More to follow.... Two more Pasok MPs have failed to toe the party line -- Thodoros Parastatidis and Angela Gerekou. There will be repercussions.... Here's the latest voting tally: 100 MPs have voted yes, while 92 have voted no. First to 151 wins. Another rebellion: Yiannis Koutsoukos of PASOK has abstained rather than voting for the measures: The vote is rattling along, and Nick Malkoutzis, the deputy editor of Kathimineri, is helpfuly tweeting highlights: We have a defection! Of sorts. A member of Democratic Left has defied instructions to abstain in tonight's vote -- and has instead voted against the austerity package. That might be significant, if the vote is very, very tight. It's a roll-call vote, which means each MPs name is, well, called out and they say whether they support or reject the memorandum. There has been applause each time an MP has voted No. A reminder - there are 300 MPs in the Athens parliament, so Antonis Samaras needs to secure 151 votes in favour of the austerity programme (known as the Third Memorandum). Democratic Left (the smaller coalition partner) has already vowed to abstain, so Samaras ought to have a majority of 154-157... But we'll see just how many MPs defy their leaders and oppose the package. Voting has begun in the Greek parliament, on the \u20ac13.5bn austerity package that was agreed between the Athens government and the Troika. As Greek protesters return home damp, cold and with a lingering smell of tear gas, there is particular anger that the riot police used water cannon today. This is said to be the first such incident in years (I remember that the unit was deployed on the streets for Angela Merkel's visit to Athens in October, but was not used). Here's another photo of it in action: Here's a view of the inside of the Greek parliament this evening (during Antonis Samaras's speech, I reckon). The final speech of the evening has begun in the Athens parliament - it's labour minister Yiannis Vroutsis. He starts by telling MPs that Greece needs to stick to reality rather than dreaming about how things could be. An update on this evenings protests in Athens -- the latest reports say that 103 people were detained* and five arrested, and with seven police injured. No update on the number of members of the public hurt (we heard five earlier tonight) * being 'detained' means a trip to the police station for questioning, rather than being charged with an offense. Confirmation that the crucial vote on Greece's austerity package is imminent - it's now due to start in 20 minutes time As we wrote at 7.38pm, the government is expected to only manage a narrow majority - especially if there are more defections from the Pasok party. And as Sky News's Alistair Bunkall points out -- tonight's vote is just one hurdle Over in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average ended today's trading session 312 points lower at 12932, a fall of 2.36%. That's the lowest closing level for the Dow since early August, Doesn't suggest Wall Street is delirious with joy over Barack Obama's triumph at the polls.... Here's a selection of photos from this evening's debate in Athens (see 6.40pm onwards for highlights of the speeches) UPDATED: And the latest word from Athens is that the crucial vote on the \u20ac13.5bn austerity package will come after 9.45pm GMT, or 11.45pm Greek time. So not too much longer to wait.... Back to Greece... where the debate ahead of the austerity vote is continuing. Panos Kammenos, head of the right-wing Independent Greeks, is speaking now. He accused the government of driving the country deeper into recession, and added that it could go bankrupt \"within a few months\". Angela Merkel and David Cameron held a press conference in London this evening, before their joint meeting (see 7.52pm for footage of the chancellor's arrival). Merkel struck a conciliatory tone over the row over the EU budget saying: Despite differences that we have it is very important for me that the UK and Germany work together.... We always have to do something that will stand up to public opinion back home. Not all of the expenditure that has been earmarked has been used with great efficiency ... We need to address that. A week ago, Cameron found himself on the wrong end of a backbench rebellion over the EU budget, with MPs voting in favour of a real-terms cut in the EU budget. That's not what Merkel wants, and even harder to achieve than Cameron's goal of pegging any increase to inflation. Here's another photo of the leaders chatting tonight. Greek journalist Makis Sinodinos reports that around 70 people have been detained today, two were arrested, and five citizens were wounded. Seperately, Skai News reported earlier this evening that five policemen have been injured in the clashes. Next up, Evangelos Venizelos of Pasok (a junior member of the coalition government). Fresh from urging his own MPs to not defect, the soclalist leader began by blasting his fellow left-winger, Alexis Tsipras. Venizelos said that while Tsipras claims to be a \"progressive\", he is actually trying to cling onto the past. He then claimed Syriza was \"investing in the death of this country\", in the hope of seizing power from the ashes of Greece. And Venizelos also defended the \u20ac13.5bn package of tax rises, spending cuts, labour reforms and other austerity - saying Athens has 'no choice' but to comply. Alexis Tsipras continued to throw verbal punches at prime minister Antonis Samaras in the Athens chamber: The Syriza leader said Samaras's privatisation programme was a flop,. and said it was crazy to front-load so much of the austerity programme (with around 70% of the total plan landing in 2013). He then argued that his policy (of rejecting the Troika's demands and negotiating a new deal) was a matter of life and death: Tsipras ended his speech by calling for new elections. Not for the first time... ...and not impressing some observers either: Meanwhile in the UK, Angela Merkel has arrived at Downing Street for talks with Prime minister David Cameron over the crisis. ITN has the video footage: Given the two leaders are divided over the issue of the EU budget, it could be a difficult evening - as ITN's deputy political editor Chris Ship explains: Alexis Tsipras, the head of the Syriza opposition party, is now speaking in parliament - and lambasting Antonis Samaras for his handling of the crisis (or at least, he was until Samaras nipped out of the chamber) Tsipras told MPs that the government was brazenly bringing in an unconstitutional law \" knowing that it will be overturned by the courts\", and also said it was wrong to use Greece \"as collateral\" for its lenders. Tsipras went on to blast the government over the infamous list of alleged tax evaders: Midway through Tsipras's address, Samaras left the room , prompting the Syriza leader to joke to MPs that the PM cannot take criticism. Samaras then returned, and responded that he would seek Tsipras's permission before taking another phone call on \"national issues\". What larks. Tsipras also argued that Greece need not fear exit from the eurozone (as Samaras suggested earlier), as Europe needs Greece as much as Greece needs Europe.... It appears that the rain and the teargas in Athens has combined to drive many of the protesters out of Syntagma Square. As Helena Smith writes: Not since the passage of the second EU-IMF sponsored bailout agreement back in February can I remember such liberal use of tear gas by police forces defending the parliament building. Although the rains have returned, the skyline above Athens is now thick with an acrid cloud of toxic fumes. In another development tonight, Mega TV is reporting that Socialist Pasok leader Evangelos Venizelos is holding back-to-back meetings with party cadres in a bid to stem dissent over the measures whoich is now threatening to tear his party apart. Hours after top level Pasok cadre Michalis Chyrsohoidis insisted that 28 MPs would back the package (see 5.11pm), speculation is growing that more will join the ranks of defectors. Helena adds: \"We are looking at as many as seven Pasok MPs who are now seriously considering not backing the bill,\" said Mega TV's parliamentary reporter. \"If that is the case the measures will be approved by 153 deputies out of the 160 seats controlled by Pasok and New Democracy,\" he said referring to the two governing parties that have pledged to back the legislation. The weaker the majority the greater the risk for the government which while surviving the vote may not be strong enough to survive the social backlash the measures are likely to unleash. Greece prime minister Antonis Samaras is giving a rousing speech in the Athens parliament, telling MPs that the package of austerity measures on the table tonight is definitely the last (Helena Smith flags up) But while the PM was speaking, riot police continued to fire tear gas outside parliament as the number of demonstrators dwindled. Samaras told the 300-seat House that: A lot of these measures are structural reforms that should have been taken years ago and others - like pension and pay - cuts are unfair but all are part of a compromise that we now have to make. The conservative leader also told MPs that they had the chance to \"seal Greece's new credibility\", and that their vote tonight would determine whether Greece remains in the eurozone or \"retreat into isolation\". He also said: Samaras will give a second speech later, after opposition leader Alexis Tsipras has spoken. Via our picture desk, here are some photos from within the heart of the clashes this evening: It's a depressing contrast with the scenes before the violence began, when hordes of people were making their point peacefully. For example, here's a shot of opposition MPs from Syriza appearing outside parliament: Back inside the parliament, finance minister Yannis Stournaras has defended the \u20ac13.5bn austerity package which MPs must vote on tonight. In the face for calls for his resignation (see 6.14pm), Stournaras insisted that Greece had no choice but to swallow yet more austerity. It's a familiar tale -- and one which the fantastic Diane Shugart tweeted. Here are some highlights: Stournaras went on to argue that Greece could build a modernised, more efficient economy, on the back of its mineral resources and tourist sector -- assets which other countries can only envy, he argued. He continued: And in conclusion, Greece's finance minister urged MPs to set aside their concerns and support the austerity bill, to guarantee the \"hope, prospects, and the continuity\" of Greece. Reports of fresh clashes between police and demonstrators: Russia Today is also streaming live footage from Athens - here. Their feed shows crowds of people moving around the centre of Athens, and other places where people are remaining in situ. There are also places where riot police are in nervy standoffs with protesters. It appears that the demonstrators are being corralled in certain parts of Syntagma Square (if they decline to leave) Occasional explosions can also be heard (i couldn't say whether they are petrol bombs or stun grenades, or something else) Here's a screengrab: Janine Louloudi, a freelance journalist, is also in Athens and reports that teargas is being liberally deployed. The disruption outside the Greek parliament was matched by chaotic scenes inside the chamber, with finance minister Yannis Stournaras facing calls for his resignation. The row began this afternoon when parliamentary staff realised that the austerity bill included an amendment to harmonise their salaries with other civil service workers - and effectively cut their pay. They responded by declaring a strike, throwing the parliament into confusion. A recess was called, amid fears that tonight's debate and voce could not continue without any note-takers. In the end, Stournaras pledged to withdraw the motion, staff returned, and the debate resumed. However he still vows to introduce the measure soon, and has been told to quit by furious opposition MPs. A reminder that you can watch the action in Syntagma Square in this live feed, embedded here: Loud blasts can also be heard over Athens as police also use stun guns in a bid to control the crowds, reports our correspondent Helena Smith She writes: The sound of tear gas canisters being fired by riot police has been exacerbated by the piercing blast of stun guns fired by riot police both in Syntagma and around its side-streets. As police helicopters circle overhead, a steady stream of protestors appear to be leaving the square and making their way into the ancient Plaka district. As I write, many are walking down Adrianou street one of the district's main arteries. \"We've made our point. We went and protested. Now those hoodlums have taken over and its getting scary we've decided to go home,\" saidMaria Koskosi, a middle aged research scientist. \"You can't even protest peacefully in Athens anymore.\" Other protesters, though, are sitting tight. Reuters reports that the violence at Syntagma Square was prompted by small number of protesters who attempted to storm the parliament. Here's their story: Violence erupts at Greek protest, parliament interrupted More photos from a wet, tear-gas soaked Athens: The situation in Athens has deteriorated in the last few minutes, with molotov cocktails being thrown at police and tear gas being used This photo (taken from the Zougla live TV feed) shows an explosion close to riot officers. People at the scene also report that the crowds booed and shouted at the people throwing the petrol bombs (typically, a small minority of rioters cause this kind of disruption in Greece). There are also reports that water cannon is now being used on the crowds, and that tear gas has been deployed. Greek police spokesnan Lt Col Christos Manouras has just told our Helena Smith that he thinks \"80,000\" protestors have converged on Syntagma Square - those unionists might just get their magic turnout tonight. Despite the protests on the streets, deputies in the socialist Pasok party reckon the austerity bill will pass tonight, despite a backbench rebellion over the measures. One MP told our own Helena Smith that the bill will get be approved, if only by a whisker. She writes: \u201cIt will definitely be voted through,\u201d said Michalis Chrysohoidis, the former minister and high-profile Pasok cadre. \u201cOut of [the party\u2019s] 33 MP\u2019s, 28 will endorse the bill. Five are still staunchly resistant but overall I see it being voted through with about 155 votes,\u201d he added referring to the fact that the government\u2019s other junior partner, the Democratic Left, will definitely abstain. \u201cI am very optimistic. Once this and the budget are ratified on Sunday things will be much easier for our country.\u201d Alexis Tsipras, the radical leftist main opposition leader, implored lawmakers not to support the bill saying: \"[your] responsibility to the country and the people is above ephemeral party discipline. We ask you not to vote the measures and the budget.\" This might be the best photo of Athens yet tonight (hat-tip Theodora Oikonomides) It's now raining in Syntagma Square, but the demonstrators aren't leaving. Instead, they are chanting slogans such as: Here came the rain, here came the storm, here came the government's end. That's via university lecturer Spyros Gkelis (who tweets as @northaura ), and also reports: Unionists have told our correspondent in Greece, Helena Smith, that as many as 200,000 could attend today\u2019s protest against the new package of austerity measures that MPs also say will almost certainly pass. From the streets of the capital, Helena reports: With the angry chants of furious workers wafting through central Athens, unionists are forecasting a healthy turn-out of protestors ahead of the vote. Although organizers of today\u2019s mass rally are keen to point out that transport links will play a role (after Tuesday\u2019s damp squib of a demonstration) the bet is on large numbers showing up in Syntagma. \u201cThere could be as many as 200,000. It\u2019s unpredictable, everything will depend on the ability of people to come in,\u201d Ilias Iliopoulos, general secretary of ADEDY, the union representing civil servants told me as militants aligned with the communist party workforce, Pame, began gathering with mathematical precision in Omonia square at 5pm local time. \u201cThere is still time to stop these measures. There is still an alternative solution to measures that are totally counter-productive and unfair.\u201d With the proposed budget cuts widely seen as the tipping point for many Greeks brought to their knees by five successive rounds of tax increases and wage and pension cuts, it will be interesting to see how many middle class Greeks turn out for the rally, analysts say. World stock markets have fallen sharply this afternoon, led by a worrying slide in New York as Wall Street traders react to Obama's victory by selling heavily. The Dow Jones industrial average has now tumbled 345 points, or 2.6%, at 12,900. The sale and speed of the rout has surprised traders. The looming US fiscal cliff, the crisis in Europe, and the weak state of the global economy have all been blamed. David Madden, market analyst at IG, said traders were being dogged by fears over the eurozone.: Barack Obama is back by popular demand, but traders are now more interested in Athens than America as stocks slide ahead of the Greek austerity vote. The European Commission got the ball rolling by cutting next year's growth forecast for the region; poor German industrial production numbers then dragged stocks into the red; before jitters surrounding the Athens austerity vote means we are now well and truly offside.... The big worry is, will the Greek coalition pass the austerity package through parliament? Reports suggest it will get through with a slim majority but investors fear the worst, although I doubt it will be blocked because the bailout is essential to Greece's survival. The negative sentiment in Europe has soured the sweet taste of Obama\u2019s victory. Here are the closing prices: FTSE 100: down 93 points at 5791, - 1.58% German DAX: down 2% French CAC: down 2.5% Spanish IBEX: down 2% Italian FTSE MIB: down 2.5% Here's a short video clip shot in Syntagma Square a little while ago Estimates for the number of people assembled outside the Athens parliament and the surrounding area range from 60,000 to 100,000. There have also been reports that the police are 'controlling' the situation by restricting access to many roads in Athens. Here's a selection of the best photos from protesters in Syntagma this evening, via Twitter: (PAME are the communist union, of course) And on a lighter note: Tens of thousands of people are now assembled outside the Athens parliament, lighting up Syntagma Square with lights and carrying banners protesting against the \u20ac13.5bn austerity package that will be voted on in a few hours. Here's a photo from the live feed (at 3.08pm ) People on the ground report that the situation is still pretty calm, despite the large crowds. Here's what some of our favourite Greek tweeters are saying: Speaking of the Athens parliament, the Syriza opposition party have written in to explain why they forced a 'roll-call' vote at the start of today's debate on the austerity package (see 10.57am for my attempt to report what happened) Nikolaos Chountis MP, said the government had \"violated any democratic notion\" by giving MPs barely a day to study a detailed 300-page report. In addition, changes to pension rights of journalists and engineers have been included even though they were rejected by MPs last week (he said). Chountis added: It is obvious that this coalition government has lost any sense of obligation to follow people's will and interests a long time ago but, the last days, they have broke even the last limits of appearing to follow the basic democratic rules. And it is so more important if we take into consideration the nature of the measures that they are adopting, measures that not only will aggravate the austerity and the recession but will permit to give away all the public services, all the institutions of common good, the land, the water and the resources of the State taking away any social, labour and environmental rights. Our picture desk have provided new photos from the Athens parliament, mostly of finance minister Yannis Stournaras (who looks in quite decent health, following his collapse last month with flu and exhaustion). Here's a couple: Here's a great quote from Angela Merkel's speech in Brussels, via regular commentator Yannis Koutsomitis: But is the European experiment one of fusion, or fission?.... As James Wilkins of Thessaloniki points out, the chancellor didn't appear to mention Greece at all... Angela Merkel has told the European Parliament that Europe should not \"shy away\" from a treaty change, it it would help calm the crisis. During her speech (see 2.54 for live feed), the German chancellor also insisted the national governments must surrender some sovereignty in return for a stronger eurozone, through \"enforced common financial and economic policies\". Merkel also repeated that she won't be rushed on creating a fully-armed banking union, saying speed must come second to quality. Another highlight - Merkel just said that she hopes to avoid a two-speed Europe. Nice aspiration, but recent development suggest the EU is heading for a 'three-speed' set-up (eurozone members embracing closer fiscal union; countries who might join the euro in future, and Britain, leaning on the emergency exit). Here's some more highlights: And here's a photo of Merkel taking questions: A reminder for anyone new: You can watch live coverage from Greece at Zougla TV Or the USTREAM page (embedded below) is also highly recommended (just click to watch) It's just gone 5pm in Greece, and that means the protests against the austerity programme are officially underway. There are now several hundred people gathered outside the Greek parliament in Syntagma Square, as this snap shows: Heads-up: Angela Merkel is about to give a speech to the European Parliament. You can watch it live, in the box below After the speech, Merkel will head to London to meet David Cameron for talks about the EU budget (among other issues) On Wall Street, investors have marked Barack Obama's re-election with a sudden burst of selling at the opening bell. That sent the Dow Jones index tumbling more than 200 points in the first few minutes of trading. Partly a reaction to the result, but partly also a recognition of the challenges facing the president (such as the fiscal cliff, another fight over the debt ceiling, and the problems across the world economy). Dr. Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive of bond trading giant Pimco, also pointed to the situation in Greece today...and Mario Draghi's speech in Germany (see 1.15pm for details) Over in Athens, municipal workers have occupied the Administrative Reform ministry in the Greek capital - leading to passionate confrontations with riot police. The occupation is part of the protests against the austerity package that will be voted on tonight. Here are some photos from the scene: One of our regular contacts in Greece, Theodora Oikonomides, reports that at least one hundred people are now assembled close to the parliament building. Plenty of police in place now, too. Back to the EC's new, gloomier forecasts (see 12.32pm). My colleague @nickvanmead has created a nifty interactive map that shows the GDP, deficit, unemployment and inflation projections over the next three years. It's here: Eurozone slashes growth forecasts And here's what it looks like: Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, has analysted the forecasts too, writing: The eurozone will struggle to emerge from a double-dip recession next year as deep budget cuts stifle growth, the European commission has said. In a gloomy health check on the state of the 17 countries that belong to the monetary union, Brussels said a sharper than expected fall in output in 2012 would be followed by a virtually non-existent recovery in 2013. The EC also warned that the UK risks missing its own fiscal adjustment targets, although Olli Rehn suggested it was too early to be certain that Britain was careering off course (there's a good write-up of the UK forecasts in the Daily Telegraph's own live blog). And Nick Spiro, bond expert at Spiro Sovereign Strategy, said the EC's reports were deeply worrying: The title of the opening chapter of the European Commission's 2012 autumn economic forecasts - \"Sailing through rough waters\" - is a masterpiece of understatement. Even a cursory glance at the bleak data for the countries in the single currency area shows that many economies' boats have long since capsized or are in danger of submerging. The full report is now online (not for the squeamish). Charles Dallara, head of the Institute of International Finance (and the man who represented Greece's private creditors in this year's \u20ac130bn debt swap deal), is heading back to Athens next week. The IIF just announced that Dallara will visit Athens on 13 and 14 November: where he will exchange views with senior government officials and private sector leaders regarding Greece and the Euro Area. Interesting timing, given the uncertainty over Greece's financial programme. Dallara will also give a speech called \u201cAdjusting Course: a Strategy for Europe and Greece to Emerge from the Crisis\u201d, at noon on November 14. Could be a good listen. Dallara has criticised Europe's pursuit of austerity several times recently. Having taken a 70% loss on their Greek loans already, Greece's private creditors are in no mood to lose the rest. And here's a new photo from Syntagma Square which shows just how quiet things are right now.... Back to Greece. With just under two hours to go before today's mass protest rallies in Athens, police units have moved into Syntagma square reports our correspondent Helena Smith. She writes: It's hard to believe that Syntagma Square, Europe's protest plaza par excellence, will soon be the staging ground for what unions are calling one of the biggest anti-austerity demonstrations ever. For now the square resembles a sleepy southern European meeting ground with the exception of the shuttered shops, banks and hotels that border it. Police presence until now has been almost non-existent although riot vans with armoured squads have just moved in and are beginning to cut off access to the parliament building on Vasillis Sofias avenue. One police officer said \"reinforcement\" of the square would be a priority with the police presence doubling that of yesterday when an estimated 40,000 protestors took to the streets. Here's a photo showing how quiet the streets of Athens were this morning: Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, has delivered a clear warning to Germany that it is being threatened by the eurozone crisis and will benefit from a lasting solution. Giving a speech in Frankfurt today, Draghi said that the eurozone was in a pretty dire situation, and pointed to recent data showing Germany's small firms were suffering. Unemployment is deplorably high. Overall economic activity is weak and it is expected to remain weak in the near term. And the growth of money and credit are subdued. Draghi also tried to explain why it was very much in Germany's interest to resolve the crisis: It is the weak euro area economy that is keeping interest rates here at very low levels. And it is the crisis of confidence in some euro area countries that is causing safe-haven flows of money into Germany, depressing interest rates even further. This highlights the fact that countries in a single currency area are connected like communicating vessels. A change in one vessel creates an equal change in all the others. He then cited the steady increase in Germany's claims on TARGET2 (the system used to handle liabilities between central banks across the eurozone): As interest rates rise in countries in difficulty, they fall in strong countries like Germany. As TARGET2 liabilities increase in some countries due to capital outflows, TARGET2 claims increase in Germany due to capital inflows. Financial developments in Germany are the mirror-image of financial developments in the rest of the euro area. And this means that measures to ensure the stability of the euro area as a whole will also be to the benefit of Germany. And in conclusion, Draghi insisted that the ECB's recent actions will not threaten taxpayers or fuel inflation (two major fears in Germany). The full transcript can be seen on the ECB website: Olli Rehn appeared to be in a pretty downbeat mood in this lunchtime's press conference (see previous post for the live video feed). Commissioner Rehn began by warning that Europe is going through a period of \"macro-economic adjustment\" which will not be finished for \"some time still\". He pointed to the latest lending data from the European Central Bank, which show a slight overall tightening of credit, and a fall in in demand for loans from companies and households He also said leaders must continue to rebalance their economies if they are to return to sustainable growth, Despite the grim message, there were also moments of mild levity: Olli Rehn is discussing the EC's new growth forecasts in Brussels now: see the video embedded below for live footage: (sorry if that started playing automatically - I've tweaked the embed code now) The European Commission has slashed its growth forecasts for the eurozone, and predicted that Spain and France will fail to hit their deficit reduction targets. The new autumn economic forecasts (released at noon) are quite comprehensive, so here are a few \"highlights\": \u2022 Eurozone GDP to fall by 0.4% in 2012, grow by just 0.1% in 2013 and then by 1.4%in 2014. \u2022 Greece's GDP will fall by 6% in 2012, and by another 4.2% in 2013, followed by 0.6% growth in 2014. \u2022 France's GDP will grow by 0.2% in 2012, by 0.4% in 2013 and \u2022 Spanish GDP will fall by 1.4% in 2012, and by 1.4% in 2013, before growing by 0.8% in 2014. As flagged up this morning, those Spanish forecasts are rather more negative than the Madrid government's officials predictions. The EC also predicted that France's deficit would come in at 3.5% of GDP in 2013 and 2014, above the 3% target. For Spain, it predicts a deficit of 8% of GDP this year, 6% in 2013 and 6.4% in 2014. From Brussels, Matina Stevis of the Wall Street Journal flag up some key facts from the report: More to follow: In other words, the EC does not accept the IMF's argument that austerity causes much more damage than thought.... Meanwhile, back in the Athens parliament.... MPs have voted that the government is not violating constitutional law by fast-tracking today's austerity bill (see 10.57am for details) 170 MPs voted that the bill was constitutional, while 47 voted against. This means the debate over the actual bill is now underway again. There are also reports from Greece that the Athens constitutional court has ruled that some parts of the \u20ac13.5bn austerity package violate the Greek constitution: The ruling comes a week after a lower court ruled that the pension reforms demanded by Greece's trioka of lenders violated provisions in the Athens constitution. Looking into it.... Protests are already taking place in Greece today, even though the main demonstrations don't begin until 5pm local time (3pm GMT). As these photos show, local authorities workers rode their motorbikes through the streets of central Athens to register their opposition to the new austerity programme. Meanwhile, over in Thessaloniki a group of people in wheelchairs are protesting outside a government building -- www.left.gr has photos. Germany's industrial sector has received a double-whammy of bad news in the last 30 minutes. Firstly, industrial output fell much more than expected in September. Output fell by 1.8% month-on-month, compared to forecasts of a 0.5% decline. The German economics ministry blamed the drop the ongoing eurozone crisis, which has dented demand across Europe. It also predicted that weak orders will hit output in the last three months of 2012. Secondly, aerospace firm Bombardier has announced that it will close a factor in Aachen, Germany, as part of a plan to cut its workforce by 1,200 people. After the early debacle (see 10.57), a vote on the constitutionality of the Greek austerity bill is now under way... Today's debate in the Athens parliament over the Greek austerity bill quickly became embroiled in a row over procedures and constitutional law, eating into time that could have been spent actually discussing the country's plight. As I mentioned at 9.09am, opposition MPs immediately challenged the legitimacy of today's emergency vote on the austerity package. Their claim that the bill was unconstitutional was turned down -- a decision they then challenged, and the result was that the session was suspended while a full \"roll-call\" vote on the issue was organised. However, the suspension dragged on for at least an hour (not the 10 minutes expected) \u2013 possibly while the government tried to round up its own MPs (several appeared to be on TV rather than in the chamber). Anyway, MPs are finally back in the chamber, where Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras denounced the government's handling of the situation, and warning that: A bill is coming that will plunge the country into a deep and protracted recession. Syriza then withdrew its claim that the process was unconstitutional, but the Athens speaker may hold a roll-call vote anyway. The debacle has left some Greeks despairing.... Fresh photos from Greece just arrived, showing that the general strike is having an obvious effect on Athens today: Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, confirms that the Greek austerity vote is now firmly in the spotlight, with the US election over: We have been here many times before, but Greece does need to get this vote through to avoid running out of funds. With little economic data on the calendar today, this vote will be the main focus of attention. Just in: eurozone retail sales have fallen, in the latest sign that its economy is weakening. Retail sales across the region fell 0.2% in September, and were 0.8% lower than the previous year. The fall - which is the biggest in five months - was partly due to a drop in fuel sales as motorists cut back. European stock markets are in a relaxed mood this morning, hitting two-week highs as the US presidential election and the Greek austerity vote fail to cause alarm. FTSE 100: up 13 points at 5898, +0.24% German DAX: up 26 points at 7404, + 0.35% French CAC: up 19 points at 3497, + 0.5% Spanish IBEX: up 42 points at 7880, + 0.5% Italy's FTSE MIB: up 41 points at 15725, + 0.26% The euro has risen against the US dollar this morning too, up half a cent at $1.2835. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explains why: The world is the same place it was yesterday, with as much uncertainty regarding the US fiscal cliff. We have seen the US dollar weaken though, on the prospect of Fed Chairman Bernanke\u2019s job and his currency weakening QE3 programme being safe. Greek newspaper Kathimerini has a good round-up of the impact of today's general strike, including a reminder that Greek police have insisted that several metro stations are closed today (to help them manage this afternoon's demonstrations): \u2022 the Athens metro and the Piraeus-Kifissia electric railway (ISAP) were expected to resume services starting at 3 pm \u2022 Greek police had ordered the Syntagma, Panepistimio, Evangelismos and Acropolis metro stations to be remain closed throughout the day. \u2022 The Athens tram service is expected to resume partial service by noon and full service by 1 p.m. \u2022 Suburban railway services, buses and trolleys are not operating; taxi drivers are also on strike and ferries are out of action. It adds: State hospitals were operating on skeleton staff on Wednesday. Pharmacies remained closed.... Continuing their industrial action on Wednesday were engineers, lawyers, prosecutors, while bank employees, municipal staff, teachers, professors and Hellenic Post staff members were also on strike. Journalists were expected to participate in a four-hour walkout from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m., while air traffic controllers were participating in a four-hour stoppage from noon to 4 p.m. Later this morning Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner responsible for the single currency, will release the EC's new autumn economic forecasts. This will include projections for growth, inflation, debt and deficit across the 17 countries of the eurozone. Some data has already leaked, suggesting that Rehn will have bad news for Spain in particular. According to El Pais, the EC will predict a 1.5% drop in GDP next year - three times as large a fall as the Madrid government expects (see here for more). If so, that would also mean Spain's recession would be just as tough next year as in 2012. Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore has also has a peek at Rehn's workings out, and reports that the EC predicts a 0.5% drop in GDP in 2013. That's slightly worse than the Rome government's forecasts. Sony Kapoor, who runs the Re-Define think tank, commented: The debate in the Athens parliament began with MPs arguing over how to handle today's vote on the austerity package. The government has introduced the bill as an emergency measure, which means MPs are restricted to 10 hours of debate, However a leading opposition MP, Panayiotis Lafazanis of Syriza, immediately demanded another four hours - which would mean the vote would take place shortly before midnight Athens time (broadly when we expected it). Lafazinis may have a point - the austerity package was only delivered to parliament on Monday evening (after around four months of grinding negotiations), so there's been little time to really analyse and discuss the package... ..as one Independent Greeks MP pointedly flagged up: Some very grim economic news from Spain \u2013 industrial production tumbled by 7% in September year-on-year, nearly twice as large a fall as economists had expected. The data also shows that Spain's industrial output is down by at least a fifth (depending how you measure it) since the financial crisis started: (SA=seasonally adjusted). Just hearing that the debate in the Athens parliament over the austerity package (known technically as the third memorandum) has begun. Greek unions have called demonstrations for this afternoon, to pile pressure on MPs as they debate the tax hikes, spending cuts and labour reforms agreed with Greece's international lenders. The protests are due to begin at 5pm Greek time, or 3pm GMT, in Syntagma Square and outside the ministry of finance in Athens. The two main unions groups, ADEDY and GSEE, are coordinating them, with the communist PAME group again planning to converge its own march. Demonstrations are also expected in other major cities. The general strike which began in Greece on Tuesday morning doesn't end until midnight tonight, which means another day of disruption across the country. There will be widespread disruption to transport links (although conductors on the Athens metro, for example, are expected back at work this afternoon). Schools and government offices will be closed, while some hospitals will be restricted to emergency cases. Power workers have also downed tools since Monday night. As usual, Living In Greece has full details of the latest strike action. While the confetti gently drifts away in Chicago, analysts are already turning their attention to Athens. Many analysts reckon that the Greek government will secure a narrow win tonight, but perhaps only by a handful of votes. With one coalition partner expected to abstain (that's Democratic Left), the two others (New Democracy and Pasok) must ensure most of their MPs support the austerity package. Reuters suggests it will be supported by 154 of Parliament's 300 MPs. As Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research comments: Strange to think that over 100 million votes cast in the US may have less impact upon the markets over the next month or so than some 300 votes due to be cast in the Greek parliament this evening. Quick look at the financial markets, where the news that Barack Obama is heading back to the White House for another four years has reassured investors in Asia. However, the question of how the president handles the looming 'fiscal cliff' is already being discussed, amid fears that the US economy could take a nasty shunt next year. Francis Lun, managing director of Lyncean Holdings in Hong Kong, reckoned Obama's victory means \"nothing will change\": We will have ultra-low interest rates, a $1 trillion deficit, and quantitative easing. Bernanke will keep his job as Fed chairman. As for the fiscal cliff, the president will do something to minimize the effect of tax increases and spending cuts. The result saw Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jump 1364 points, or 0.63%, to 22,083 in late trading with Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 up 0.7%. Japan's Nikkei 225 index pulled back almost all its early falls, ending down just 2 points at 8,972.89. Associated Press has more details. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis, and other important events in the world economy. It's a crunch day for Europe as Greek MPs debate the country's \u20ac13.5bn austerity package. A vote is due tonight, and the stakes are vertiginous - should the package be rejected then Greece will be hurled into a deeper crisis; without the cuts and tax rises Athens will not receive fresh financial assistance. And while MPs debate the latest package being forced on Greece, tens of thousands of people will be protesting on the streets of cities across the country, as the 48-hour general strike which began on Tuesday continues. Yesterday's protests were more peaceful than we dared hope (leaving aside the firebombing of a fire engine). Today's demonstrations are likely to be busier as more transport links will be working. Can they be as trouble-free?.... It promises to be a busy day \u2013 we also get fresh economic forecasts from the European Commission this morning (more shortly), while several key figures including Angela Merkel and Mario Draghi are giving speeches. Merkel is then due in London this evening for a working dinner with David Cameron. As usual we'll be tracking all the major developments across the crisis, in Athens and beyond.",
