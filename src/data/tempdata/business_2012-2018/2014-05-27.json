      "bodyText": "Bad debts could be putting banks and building societies at greater risk than thought \u2013 and leading them to overstate profits \u2013 because their auditors are failing to do a thorough job, according to the accounting standards regulator. In its annual report on audit standards, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said that years on from the financial crisis the auditing of banks and building societies was below the general standard for the UK, even though banks were riskier than other companies. The FRC inspected the audits of five banks and building societies for the year ended December 2013, including large financial institutions. None of the audits was judged to be good and one required major improvements. More than half \u2013 56% \u2013 needed some improvements. The watchdog found that auditors did not question lenders' management teams closely enough about bad debt provisions and did not demand more evidence to support the company's claims. Monitoring of loans subject to \"forbearance\" \u2013 letting borrowers delay payments to avoid defaulting \u2013 was a worry. The findings show auditors are still failing to check banks' books properly despite the big accountancy firms having come under fire after the crisis for having signed off lenders' books for years as risk built up in the financial system. The watchdog warned in December that it would investigate lenders' audits, and will report on its investigation in November. Paul George, the FRC's director of conduct, said: \"We have not seen enough progress in the quality of bank and building society audits, which continues to be generally below that of other types \u2026 We are particularly concerned about the lack of sufficient challenge when testing key assumptions underpinning loan loss provisions. \"The fact we have identified it means we are surprised, disappointed, whatever adjective you want to add to it. They allocate high quality resources to this work and we would have thought they would be performing to a higher level than we have seen, so yes, we are surprised.\" The findings raise fears that bad debts are still lurking on lenders' balance sheets and that they could be trying to avoid reporting problem loans that could eat into their capital. The FRC is not responsible for assessing banks' capital positions but other regulators have said they are worried that letting struggling customers defer loan payments is storing up trouble. The Bank of England is investigating what will happen to mortgage borrowers when interest rates start to rise. George said: \"The risk is that the quantum of loan loss provisions is understated and profits are overstated. We are not saying that is the outcome. We are saying that to be satisfied that is not the outcome the auditor needs to do more work.\" An audit is meant to be an independent assessment of a company's financial position so that shareholders can make a clear judgment on management. But the big accountants have been accused of being too close to banks' management and not taking a tough enough line on claims made in the accounts. The big audit firms \u2013 Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG and EY \u2013 have been accused of conflicts of interest for serving the interests of banks' management instead of those of the shareholders who own the company. Their fees for consultancy services often outstrips the money the banks pay for their audits. The FRC said that in general the quality of audit work in the UK had increased. But it raised concerns about so-called letterbox companies that are audited in Britain but whose main business activities are elsewhere. Too many of these companies' audits are signed off by accountants in the UK when the main work is carried out by their colleagues in other countries, raising fears that auditors too close to the company are approving the books.",

Closer dissection of Sunday\u2019s European elections result has revealed that the far rightists have made extraordinary inroads into areas that were once socialist strongholds as well as winning over the hearts and minds of younger Greeks.</p> <p>Despite being under criminal investigation \u2013 with a third of its leadership in prison \u2013 Golden Dawn saw its popularity rise from 6.9% in June 2012 (when it was catapulted into parliament with 18 MPs) to 9.3% in Sunday\u2019s poll.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Golden Dawn, which will now be sending three MEPs to Brussels, appealed mostly to voters aged between 18 and 44, according to further analysis of exit polls, Helena flags up, explaining:</b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Contrary to perceived wisdom many had received higher education, although for the first time farmers were also noted as flocking to Golden Dawn.</p> <p>Greeks of a productive age, in both the public and state sector, were similarly recorded as casting votes in favour of Golden Dawn. \u201cAt 13.8 % it is the first time that farmers have shown such a high percentage of preference for the far right party,\u201d the leading daily Ta Nea wrote. \u201cAnother characteristic is that its voters are men, 13% compared to 6.5 % who are women.\u201d</p> <p>Even in working class areas, long in the grip of the left, the neo Nazis appear to have made gains on the back of the country\u2019s prolonged economic crisis. In Nikea, the suburb where the Greek rapper Pavlos Fyssas was killed last September \u2013 spurring the crackdown against the group \u2013 the extremists saw a discernible rise in support. In another worrying sign, police backing for the party also topped 50%.</p> <p>From his self-described \u201cprison cell of honour,\u201d Golden Dawn\u2019s founder Nikos Michaloliakos described the result as a great feat. \u201cWhether they like it or not we are now the third political force of the country.

New Labour thought it had discovered a magic money-tree and gave up on regulation; journalists on the whole failed to read the runes or question the new macho expansionist, masters-of-the-universe culture; the public liked the easy credit and soaring house prices and was too lazy to examine what was happening in the City; and what naysayers and doom-mongers there were tended to be marginalised.</p> <p>Much of this remains true even today.

It has also been associated with high unemployment, rising social tensions, and growing political disillusion \u2013 all of this happening in the wake of the Great Recession.</p> <p>One of the main casualties has been trust\u2014in leaders, in institutions, in the free-market system itself. The most recent poll conducted by the Edelman Trust Barometer, for example, showed that less than a fifth of those surveyed believed that governments or business leaders would tell the truth on an important issue. </p> <p>This is a wakeup call. Trust is the lifeblood of the modern business economy. Yet, in a world that is more networked than ever, trust is harder to earn and easier to lose. Or as the Belgians say, \u201cla confiance part a\u0300 cheval et revient a\u0300 pied\u201d (\u201cconfidence leaves on a horse and comes back on foot\u201d). </p> <p>So the big question is: how can we restore and sustain trust? </p> <p>First and foremost, by making sure that growth is more inclusive and that the rules of the game lead to a level playing field\u2014favoring the many, not just the few; prizing broad participation over narrow patronage. </p> <p>By making capitalism more inclusive, we make capitalism more effective, and possibly more sustainable. But if inclusive capitalism is not an oxymoron, it is not intuitive either, and it is more of a constant quest than a definitive destination.</p> </blockquote> <p><b><i>More to follow....</i></b></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5384444ae4b0d9c6b9be7e33\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-27T08:00:50.678Z\">9.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>With France's economy stagnating in the last quarter, it's no surprise that French consumers remain cautious.</b></p> <p>The latest survey of French consumer confidence was unchanged for April at 85.

      "bodyText": "Just time to flag up that the US stock market closed higher, again, tonight with traders pushing the S&amp;P 500 index to yet another record high... If you're just joining us, a quick recap of the two main points: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has warned tonight that Capitalism is doomed if ethics vanish. And this morning, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde called for a renewed effort to restore trust in the financial system, and blasted banks for blocking efforts to reform the sector and avoid another financial crisis (see earlier summary). I can't remember the last time we had so many of the world's most powerful financial figures warning that capitalism is in trouble. So what's afoot? Over to Larry Elliott, our economics editor, who reckons that when Lagarde and Carney\"start banging on like a couple of social democrats at a Labour party fringe meeting, it is worth paying attention\". He writes: Something is up. That something is the way the world operates in the aftermath of its most profound economic shock of the postwar era. This has been a period of slow growth, rising inequality and \u2013 as the results of the elections to the European parliament show \u2013 political alienation. People struggling to cope with wages that don't keep pace with inflation feel that they are paying the price of a crisis they did not cause while the perpetrators of the crime get away scot free. Here's the full piece: Carney and Lagarde acknowledge City's primeval will to survive And that really is all for tonight. Cheers. GW Mark Carney's speech on the need to rebuild ethics in capitalism is online here. (hat-tip to financial expert Frances Coppola, who's been tweeting about the speech as well) Larry Summers has been banking the inequality drum again tonight (we covered his speech around 2pm in the blog) The BBC also has a good take on the BoE governor's speech, headlined Carney urges bankers to adopt 'high ethical standards' Speaking at a conference on the future of capitalism, Mark Carney said financiers should be \"custodians of their institutions\". He added that a \"reductionist view of the human condition\" had prevailed in the run-up to the financial crisis. Mr Carney also emphasised the need to tackle growing global inequality. The governor said board members and senior management at banks should clearly define the purpose of their organisation and promote \"a culture of ethical business\". Hello again. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has issued a blunt warning that the leaders of capitalism must help build a fairer society. Speaking at the Inclusive Capitalism event which we've been covering through the day, Carney said bankers had operated a \"heads-I-win-tails-you-lose\" system that undermined the fundamental building blocks of the financial system. He's adding his voice to Christine Lagarde, who called for world leaders and business people to help rebuild trust in capitalism and the financial system this morning. As Carney put it: \"Just as any revolution eats its children, unchecked market fundamentalism can devour the social capital essential for the long-term dynamism of capitalism itself. To counteract this tendency, individuals and their firms must have a sense of their responsibilities for the broader system.\" Carney, a former Goldman Sachs banker himself, is warning that there are serious dangers when \"the belief in the power of the market enters the realm of faith\". My colleague Angela Monaghan reports: Carney said market radicalism and light-touch regulation had eroded fair capitalism, while scandals such as the rigging of Libor markets had undermined trust in the financial system. Here's her story: Capitalism is doomed if ethics vanish, says Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, will give a speech on Inclusive Capitalism in just under three hours -- it will be streamed live here, at 8pm BST. Worth watching out for, I believe. We'll cover it on Guardian Business (I'll try to pop back into the blog and add a link or key details too). Until then, thanks and goodnight. GW Time to recap: Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has blasted banks for obstructing efforts to reform the financial sector. In a speech calling for capitalism to be more accountable and ethical, Lagarde also told business leaders and politicians that income inequality was holding back growth. Extreme inequality must be tackled, she insisted. The speech has been welcomed by Oxfam tonight. The charity said Lagarde's speech was \"a welcome sign of changing times\", but added that the Fund must ensure its own policies help to close the gap between rich and poor. Lagarde warned that the financial sector has not changed its behaviour fundamentally since the crisis, declaring: \"Some prominent firms have even been mired in scandals that violate the most basic ethical norms - Libor and foreign exchange rigging, money laundering, illegal foreclosure.\" And she warned there has been \"fierce industry pushback\" from the sector, and that the the too-big-to-fail problem has not yet been solved: The good news is that the international community has made progress on the reform agenda. This is especially true for banking regulation under the auspices of the Basel Committee, where we are moving forward with stronger capital and liquidity requirements. This should make the system safer, sounder, and more service oriented. The bad news is that progress is still too slow, and the finish line is still too far off. Some of this arises from the sheer complexity of the task at hand. Yet, we must acknowledge that it also stems from fierce industry pushback, and from the fatigue that is bound to set in at this point in a long race. Speaking at a conference on Inclusive Capitalism, she also warned that: capitalism's leaders needed to more to rebuild trust, to make the system fairer and more inclusive. Otherwise, we risk depleting the \"treasury of trust\", and again destabilising the global economy.... Inequality had risen to the top of the agenda in business and politics... ...quoting Churchill, Kennedy, Aristotle and Wilde to hammer home the message And concluded that repairing our 'financial footprint' is a tougher job then fixing our carbon footprint. Former US treasury secretary Larry Summers also warned the conference that technological changes and the threat of \"secular stagnation\" had serious consequences;. It may be impossible to ever achieve a situation where everyone who wants work has a job, for example. As he put it: \"We are seeing less and less opportunity for what average people \u2013 people lacking in certain skills \u2013 are going to be able to do.\u201d In other news.. Don't miss our special report on the City: An outsider\u2019s guide to the City of London European stock markets have rallied despite the gains made by anti-establishment and extremist parties in last weekend's European Parliament elections. The Greek government has denied that the victory of the left-wing opposition party, Syriza, will spark early general elections.... ...while analysis of the election results shows the far-right Golden Dawn did well with younger voters. Pfizer's shares have risen following its failure to pull off a merger with AstraZeneca, whose shares dipped another 2% today. While Lloyds has confirmed it will float TSB on the stock market -- with free shares on offer to those who hold onto their stake for a year. Oxfam's reference to the impact of IMF's own policies on inequality is a reminder that the Fund does bear some responsibility for the austerity measures imposed on parts of Europe since the crisis began -- and indeed its long track record of forcing painful measures on countries to make them more competitive. Nearly a year ago, the IMF admitted that mistakes were made in the way Greece's first bailout package was devised and implemented -- the Greek economy has now been shrinking for six years with jobless rates over 26%. That's not helped inequality levels in the country, or beyond. Christine Lagarde's call on world leaders and business people to fight economic exclusion and income inequality has been welcomed this afternoon by Oxfam, the anti-poverty and global development charity. Emma Seery, head of Oxfam's Inequality Campaign, said: \"It is a welcome sign of changing times when the head of the IMF is warning about the need to tackle the growing problem of inequality. Christine Lagarde has a key role to play - not only in signalling the need for world leaders to act to reduce the gap between rich and poor, but also by ensuring the IMF's own policies do the same.\" If you missed Lagarde's speech, highlights start here (and the full text is now online here) And as mentioned earlier, the IMF chief cited Oxfam's work on this issue -- including the remarkable fact that the world's 85 richest people own as much wealth as much as the poorest half of the world's population. Europe's stock markets have finished for the day, with Germany's DAX index climbing higher into record-breaking territory. 16:30 - EUROPE'S FTSEUROFIRST 300 PROVISIONALLY CLOSES 0.2% HIGHER AT 1,378.79 POINTS 16:30 - BRITAIN'S FTSE 100 RISES 0.4%, GERMANY'S DAX UP 0.5%, FRANCE'S CAC 40 RISES 0.1% 16:30 - SPAIN'S IBEX UP 0.2%, ITALY'S FTSE MIB DOWN 0.4% At around 9942 points, the DAX isn't far off hitting the 10,000 mark for the first time: Over to Greece where the analysis of exit polls have sent shudders through the political establishment as parties digest the rise and rise of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens Marine Le Pen may have announced this morning that her Front National will not be linking up with the likes of Golden Dawn, but the Greek neo-fascists' seemingly effortless ascent through Greek society is nonetheless causing alarm. Closer dissection of Sunday\u2019s European elections result has revealed that the far rightists have made extraordinary inroads into areas that were once socialist strongholds as well as winning over the hearts and minds of younger Greeks. Despite being under criminal investigation \u2013 with a third of its leadership in prison \u2013 Golden Dawn saw its popularity rise from 6.9% in June 2012 (when it was catapulted into parliament with 18 MPs) to 9.3% in Sunday\u2019s poll. Golden Dawn, which will now be sending three MEPs to Brussels, appealed mostly to voters aged between 18 and 44, according to further analysis of exit polls, Helena flags up, explaining: Contrary to perceived wisdom many had received higher education, although for the first time farmers were also noted as flocking to Golden Dawn. Greeks of a productive age, in both the public and state sector, were similarly recorded as casting votes in favour of Golden Dawn. \u201cAt 13.8 % it is the first time that farmers have shown such a high percentage of preference for the far right party,\u201d the leading daily Ta Nea wrote. \u201cAnother characteristic is that its voters are men, 13% compared to 6.5 % who are women.\u201d Even in working class areas, long in the grip of the left, the neo Nazis appear to have made gains on the back of the country\u2019s prolonged economic crisis. In Nikea, the suburb where the Greek rapper Pavlos Fyssas was killed last September \u2013 spurring the crackdown against the group \u2013 the extremists saw a discernible rise in support. In another worrying sign, police backing for the party also topped 50%. From his self-described \u201cprison cell of honour,\u201d Golden Dawn\u2019s founder Nikos Michaloliakos described the result as a great feat. \u201cWhether they like it or not we are now the third political force of the country. We are undoubtedly the winners of the election,\u201d he said reckoning that the party had seen a 36 % increase in popularity from June 2012 despite \u201cthe absolutely hostile environment\u201d in which it had been forced to campaign. Human Rights groups have stepped up the clarion calls. \u201cGolden Dawn\u2019s popularity, even after revelations about its Nazi ideology and its alleged involvement in two murders and dozens of assaults, underscores the need for rigorous and credible prosecution that meets the highest European judicial standards and is not tainted by accusations of political motivation,\u201d said Human Rifhts First\u2019s Tad Stahnke, part of a team in Athens researching the human rights implications of the rise of far-right parties in Europe. Judicial officials hope to try all of Golden Dawn\u2019s 18 MPs on charges of \u201cdirecting and operating\u201d a criminal organization by the end of the year. But what Sunday\u2019s polls have proved is that such accusations are not washing with the Greek public. The FT has another quote from Larry Summers's speech this afternoon, on the trend of machines taking over work once carried out by humans: We are seeing less and less opportunity for what average people \u2013 people lacking in certain skills \u2013 are going to be able to do.\u201d Afternoon reading: My colleagues on our Cities section have published an impressively thorough report on the City of London today. Our own Stephen Moss has taken a journey into the heart of the financial world, meeting some of the bankers, traders and analysts who work in a system that many of us struggle to fully understand. Definitely worth a read -- here's a flavour: Evading responsibility Meeting Kynaston and Augar was crucial to my understanding that, in a way, we were all responsible for the crash. We \u2013 the public, journalists, politicians \u2013 let it happen because we didn't challenge the City, didn't try to understand it. New Labour thought it had discovered a magic money-tree and gave up on regulation; journalists on the whole failed to read the runes or question the new macho expansionist, masters-of-the-universe culture; the public liked the easy credit and soaring house prices and was too lazy to examine what was happening in the City; and what naysayers and doom-mongers there were tended to be marginalised. Much of this remains true even today. Who understands the implications of George Osborne's great pensions reform, and who is bothering to find out what it means? Is the alleged collusion in foreign exchange trading getting the play it deserves? Do we understand the recent shake-up of personnel at the Bank of England, which saw the installation of a new head of financial stability? Special report: an outsider\u2019s guide to the City of London Wall Street has opened for business, and the Dow Jones industrial average is matching Europe with a small gain in early trading. Pfizer was leading the risers, up 1.3% to $29.75 after walking away from its takeover offer approach for AstraZeneca yesterday. As fastFT points out, Pfizer has some work to do on its share price after underperforming the market since revealing its desire to merge with AstraZeneca. A month ago, the shares were worth over $32 each. AstraZeneca shares, meanwhile, are the biggest faller in London -- down 2.3% at \u00a342.25 after Pfizer's \u00a355-per-share offer becomes a distant memory (although it can bid again in six months). Some more details of Larry Summers' speech (highlights start here) I\"m afraid the webfeed from the Inclusive Capitalism conference kept cutting out (not a victory for inclusivity). But amid the crackling and silences, former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers warned business leaders and politicians that the employment landscape has dramatically changed. He reminded them that in 1965, just 1 in 20 American men aged 25-54 were out work. Today, it's one in six. And technology is rewriting the rules, and eating into many middle class professions. Summers concluded that \"it is not necessarily the case\" that there will be jobs for all at acceptable wages , no matter how technology evolves. Summers also mentions one of his favourite lines -- that with borrowing costs near record lows, and construction unemployment high, America should take advantage and reinvest in Kennedy Airport. He admits that he's said this often before (I heard it at Davos) -- so often, in fact, that the head of the Port Authority phoned him up to complain that it's not that simple. So they had a chat, Summers says, and he learned that its air traffic control system was stretched and would benefit from an upgrade. Summers cites his fears that the world economy is in secular stagnation -- that the only way to get full employment is to cut interest rates so low that it's either not feasable, or risks financial stability. Larry Summers runs through a long list of financial crises from the last few decades -- such as Black Wednesday, the Long-Term Capital Management collapse,the 1997 Asian crisis -- as proof that the financial system has consistently failed to rein itself in. That has hurt ordinary people around the globe, who think that \"to put is a verb, rather than a financial security\", Summers jokes grimly. \"That is not an acceptable way for the world to operate.\" Now Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, is speaking at the Inclusive Capitalism event in London. It's being streamed live here. Summers is discussing wages - saying people's purchasing power has been stagnant in real terms for many years. But it's not as simple as that. If you look at wages measured in terms of cars, toys (ie, how much work you need to do to buy one), then the cost of cars has halved, Summers says. Wages have been stagnant because of what's happened to the price of housing, education, health and scarce resources like food and energy. Summers is also explaining that new technologies have yielded massive improvements: A student in my class doesn't have the ability to ask me to repeat the last two minutes of my lecture - a student online does. But technology only goes so far.... It still takes one teacher one hour to produce a personalised classroom experience for 15 students -- and the price of that will go up, putting more pressure on non-for-profit and the public sector. Twitter is buzzing with reaction to Christine Lagarde's speech, particularly her warning that income inequality is a threat to 'inclusive capitalism' and should be tackled (see 11.51am) Just in - a surge in demand for defence hardware has driven demand for durable goods across America last month. Durable goods orders jumped 0.8% month-on-month in April, defying expectations of a 0.5% decline. It's mainly due to strong demand for military equipment -- with sales of defence aircraft and parts rising by 13%. Other transport equipment sales gained 2.3%. But if you strip out the defence sector, new orders actually dipped by 0.8%. And spending on capital equipment (heavy duty machinery) fell by 3%. A mixed picture Over in Greece, the government has rejected talk of an early general election after the left-wing Syriza party won last weekend's European Parliament elections, and demanded a snap poll. Greek government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou said the coalition has \"absolutely no intention\" of triggering early elections, and is confident it can still govern. The Kathimerini newspaper reports: Speaking on Skai TV on Tuesday morning, Kedikoglou said that he does not \"foresee any obstacles that [the government] will not be able to overcome\" in regard to draft laws and reforms that will be presented to Parliament over the course of the next few months, which could potentially threaten the coalition's narrow three-seat majority in the 300-member House. A new survey has found Britain is outpacing the rest of Europe when it comes to attracting overseas investment. The number of foreign investment projects in the UK rose by 15% last year to 799, according to Ernst and Young. Meanwhile, Germany saw an increase of 12%, to 701. France only reported a 9% increase, though, to 514 projects. More here. While Prince Charles and the Lord Mayor of London were discussing the finer points of inclusive capitalism this morning, the International Labour Organisation was warning of a jobs crisis in the developing world. In a new report, the ILO warned that more than half of workers in the developing world are trapped in vulnerable jobs, working for themselves or in unpaid family work. My colleague Katie Allen explains: The problem is most acute in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with more than three out of four workers in vulnerable forms of employment, and women disproportionately affected. Repeating its warnings in previous reports about the burden on younger generations, the ILO highlights a youth unemployment rate of more than 12% in developing countries \u2013 more than three times the unemployment rate for adults. The highest youth unemployment rates are in the Middle East and North Africa regions, where nearly one in three young people in the labour force are unable to find work. More here: Half of developing world's workers trapped in vulnerable jobs, says ILO And the full ILO report is here. Christine Lagarde didn't mention French economist Thomas Piketty's work on how capitalism fuels wealth inequality (now in the full glare of the spotlight after the Financial Times reported it had found errors in his work) But she did call for action to address \"extreme income inequality\", perhaps through wealth transfers and income taxes. Here's the key section of her speech: Fundamentally, excessive inequality makes capitalism less inclusive. It hinders people from participating fully and developing their potential. Disparity also brings division. The principles of solidarity and reciprocity that bind societies together are more likely to erode in excessively unequal societies. History also teaches us that democracy begins to fray at the edges once political battles separate the haves against the have-nots. A greater concentration of wealth could\u2014if unchecked\u2014even undermine the principles of meritocracy and democracy. It could undermine the principle of equal rights proclaimed in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pope Francis recently put this in stark terms when he called increasing inequality \u201cthe root of social evil\u201d. Paul Mason, now culture and digital editor at Channel 4 News, is the latest to stir the Piketty pot.... Thomas Piketty's real challenge was to the FT's Rolex types The FT responds... (retweeted by Mason himself) And here's my colleague Angela Monaghan's take on Christine Lagarde's speech in London today: The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that a persistent violation of ethics among bankers and rising inequality pose a major threat to growth and financial stability. Christine Lagarde told an audience in London that six years on from the deep financial crisis that engulfed the global economy, banks were resisting reform and still too focused on excessive risk taking to secure their bonuses at the expense of public trust. She said: \"The behaviour of the financial sector has not changed fundamentally in a number of dimensions since the crisis. While some changes in behaviour are taking place, these are not deep or broad enough. The industry still prizes short-term profit over long-term prudence, today's bonus over tomorrow's relationship. \"Some prominent firms have even been mired in scandals that violate the most basic ethical norms - Libor and foreign exchange rigging, money laundering, illegal foreclosure.\" Full story: IMF chief says banks haven't changed since financial crisis Just in, photos of Christine Lagarde addressing the Inclusive Capitalism conference... ..and sharing a moment with Prince Charles; Fiona Woolf, the Lord Mayor of London, and Lady Lynn Forester De Rothschild. Not the most inclusive gathering ever.... Back to Christine Lagarde's speech on inclusive capitalism, and Reuters has homed in on her warning that the banking sector is obstructing the vital task of repairing the financial system. Here's it's take: Progress in completing banking reforms to plug gaps highlighted by the 2007-09 financial crisis is too slow and is being hampered by fierce industry lobbying, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said banks were holding more capital now than they did in the run-up to the financial crisis when taxpayers had to shore up the sector. \"The bad news is that progress is still too slow, and the finish line is still too far off,\" Lagarde told a conference on economic inclusion in London. While the task of reforming banks is complex, progress is also being held back by \"fierce industry pushback\" and fatigue that is bound to set in at this point in a long race, she said. \"A big gap is that the too-big-to-fail problem has not yet been solved,\" Lagarde said, referring to the belief in markets that governments will still step in to rescue the biggest banks to avoid the mayhem seen when Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008. Full story: IMF's Lagarde says bank reforms slowed by fierce industry pushback Analysts at ETX Capital say European markets are also rallying because geopolitical tensions have eased a little after last weekend's Ukrainian presidential election was won by pro-European businessman Petro Poroshenko: Moscow said it was willing to hold talks with Kiev\u2019s newly elected president, causing hope of progress between both countries which could see a war being avoided. Poroshenko must now tackle a desperately divided country, a weakened currency, a deep recession, and austerity cuts agreed in return for an bailout from the IMF.... Back in the financial markets, European investors remain calm about the swing away from mainstream parties in last weekend's election (as explained in our opening post). Germany's DAX has hit yet another all-time high, closing in on the 10,000 point mark. It's currently up 0.3% at 9925. In London, the FTSE 100 is up 35 points at 6851, and would be higher still without AstraZeneca (-2%) pulling it down after Pfizer walked away from its takeover offer. France's CAC index is flat, as Paris digests the resignation of Jean-Francois Cope, leader of the opposition UMP party, this morning. Perhaps unsurprisingly, staff at the Financial Times and Oxfam approach the issue of inclusive capitalism from different angles, as this Twitter exchange shows: Christine Lagarde is now tweeting the main message from her speech: Christine Lagarde finished her speech by paying tribute to one of the hosts of today's conference on Inclusive Capitalism --E.L. Rothschild (!)*. Lagarde concluded: When the global economy is more inclusive, the gains will be less elusive. * - Readers may not immediately place the Rothschild family in the first wave of warriors in the battle against inequality. But Lynn Forester de Rothschild has been arguing for capitalism to be more inclusive, and long-term, for several years. In 2012, she argued that \"It's not acceptable, in an era of rising income inequality, to focus just on delivering measurable shareholder value without generating value for the broader society as well.\" And in case anyone wants to ignore Christine Lagarde's stern words, she concludes that reducing the world's \"financial footprint\" is even harder than reducing \"our carbon footprint\". And just as important, the IMF managing director added: I realize that these are deeper questions than economists and policymakers are normally comfortable talking about. Yet I also believe the link is clear\u2014ethical behavior is a major dimension of financial stability. Fail to fix it, and we risk depleting the \"treasury of trust\", and again destabilising the global economy.... Someone's been working overtime in the IMF library -- Christine Lagarde went on to quote Aristotle and Oscar Wilde, in her call for action to make capitalism more ethical: She says: To restore trust, we need a shift toward greater integrity and accountability. We need a stronger and systematic ethical dimension. In grappling with this, it helps to go back to the ancient philosophers. They would have raised the most basic question\u2014what is the social purpose of the financial sector? Or, as Aristotle would have asked: \u201cwhat is its telos?\u201d He answered his own question: \u201cWealth is evidently not the good we are seeking; for it is merely useful and for the sake of something else\u201d. Or as Oscar Wilde put it, \u201cthe true perfection of man lies, not in what man has, but in what man is\u201d. The IMF have now uploaded the transcript of Christine Lagarde's speech: Economic Inclusion and Financial Integrity\u2014an Address to the Conference on Inclusive Capitalism Christine Lagarde is quoting both Winston Churchill and President John F. Kennedy as she urges business leaders and politicians to inject more integrity into capitalism, in her speech in London right now (highlights start here) The IMF chief has stern words for the financial sector, saying that banks have pushed back against efforts to reform them to avoid a repeat of the 2008 crisis: Lagarde says: Thankfully, the crisis has prompted a major course correction\u2014with the understanding that the true role of the financial sector is to serve, not to rule, the economy. Its real job is to benefit people, especially by financing investment and thus helping with the creation of jobs and growth. As Winston Churchill once remarked, \u201cI would rather see finance less proud and industry more content\u201d. The good news is that the international community has made progress on the reform agenda. This is especially true for banking regulation under the auspices of the Basel Committee, where we are moving forward with stronger capital and liquidity requirements. This should make the system safer, sounder, and more service oriented. The bad news is that progress is still too slow, and the finish line is still too far off. Some of this arises from the sheer complexity of the task at hand. Yet, we must acknowledge that it also stems from fierce industry pushback, and from the fatigue that is bound to set in at this point in a long race. The problem of banks who are \"too big to fail\" has not gone away, Lagarde warns. More must be done to reduce the potential for contagion. She says the world economy needs an agreement on cross-border resolution of megabanks\u2014providing a framework to unwind them in an orderly way in case of failure: This is a gaping hole in the financial architecture right now, and it calls for countries to put the global good of financial stability ahead of their parochial concerns. And we should not give up just because it is hard. Let me quote John Fitzgerald Kennedy here, who famously said that \u201cwe choose to go to the moon not because it is easy, but because it is hard\u201d. Lagarde cites recent research from Oxfam that the 85 richest people in the world, who could fit into a single London double-decker, control as much wealth as the poorest half of the global population -- all 3.5 billion of them. With facts like these, it is no wonder that rising inequality has risen to the top of the agenda\u2014not only among groups normally focused on social justice, but also increasingly among politicians, central bankers, and business leaders. Christine Lagarde began her speech by pondering whether \u201cinclusive capitalism\u201d is an oxymoron, or a response to Karl Marx prediction that capitalism holds the seeds to its own destruction. I'll post a full transcript shortly Breaking: Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has called for the financial system needs to be reshaped to create greater integrity, and warned that the problem of banks which are Too Big to Fail has not been solved. Speaking at a conference on Inclusive Capitalism in London right now(live-stream here), Lagarde also urged business leaders to make economic growth more inclusive. I've got a copy of the speech - in which Lagarde warns that Capitalism has been scarred by 'excess' -- such as too much risk-taking, leverage, and complexity. She will say: It led to massive destruction of value. It has also been associated with high unemployment, rising social tensions, and growing political disillusion \u2013 all of this happening in the wake of the Great Recession. One of the main casualties has been trust\u2014in leaders, in institutions, in the free-market system itself. The most recent poll conducted by the Edelman Trust Barometer, for example, showed that less than a fifth of those surveyed believed that governments or business leaders would tell the truth on an important issue. This is a wakeup call. Trust is the lifeblood of the modern business economy. Yet, in a world that is more networked than ever, trust is harder to earn and easier to lose. Or as the Belgians say, \u201cla confiance part a\u0300 cheval et revient a\u0300 pied\u201d (\u201cconfidence leaves on a horse and comes back on foot\u201d). So the big question is: how can we restore and sustain trust? First and foremost, by making sure that growth is more inclusive and that the rules of the game lead to a level playing field\u2014favoring the many, not just the few; prizing broad participation over narrow patronage. By making capitalism more inclusive, we make capitalism more effective, and possibly more sustainable. But if inclusive capitalism is not an oxymoron, it is not intuitive either, and it is more of a constant quest than a definitive destination. More to follow.... With France's economy stagnating in the last quarter, it's no surprise that French consumers remain cautious. The latest survey of French consumer confidence was unchanged for April at 85. That's some way below the long term average of 100, but better than the record low of 79 plumbed last summer. Statistics INSEE also found that people's general economic outlook has deteriorated. International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde is in London today, to give the keynote event at a conference on \"Inclusive Capitalism\". She begins speaking at 9.15am - it will be streamed live here. The full agenda is here, if inclusive capitalism is your thing.... ...or indeed a thing at all, as Newsnight's Laura Kuenssberg asks: Britain's tax collectors have racked up a record year, pulling in more revenue from suspected tax avoiders than ever before. Figures released this morning shows that HM Revenue and Customs's investigations into tax avoidance brought in \u00a323.9bn in the 2013-14 financial year -- a \u00a33.2bn increase. That's \u00a39bn higher than three years ago, and nearly \u00a31bn above the target set by the chancellor, George Osborne, in his 2013 autumn statement. More than \u00a38bn was secured from large businesses, more than \u00a31bn from criminals and \u00a32.7bn from tackling tax avoidance schemes in the courts, it added. Here's the full story: UK tax inspectors collect record \u00a323.9bn Marc Ostwald, analyst at Monument Security, reckons the European Parliament election results were not seismic enough to panic investors: While the jump in the vote for Eurosceptic, far right and left parties will allow them to protest and criticize legislation, the fact remains that the Centre-right/left pro-EU groupings still won 467 of the 751 seats. Thus, the election's overall results clearly are a call for change, but they are far from being an irresistible catalyst for change. UKIP's remarkable rise in popularity could create some jitters in the UK ahead of the next general election, Ostwald adds: The outcome of the UK vote still leaves the impression that the nascent recovery, about which there is so much optimism (rightly or wrongly), may yet founder on the rocks of the political uncertainty associated with next year's election. InterContinental Hotels are the biggest riser in London, up 6% following weekend reports that it has turned down a \u00a36bn takeover bid from a US rival. The bidder hasn't been identified -- but it appears that they could be planning to shift their tax domicile to Britain; as Pfizer had hoped to do. AstraZeneca is leading the FTSE 100 fallers this morning, down to \u00a342.70, after Pfizer announced yesterday afternoon that it had walked away from its takeover bid. But the US firm could return in six months for another nibble at the 'jewel in the crown' of UK pharmaceuticals. This battle may not be over... As expected, shares are rising in London this morning as the City catches up with the rest of Europe (who didn't get a bank holiday on Monday): The FTSE 100 is up 22 points, or 0.3%, to 6,838 as traders get their first chance to react to the weekend's election results. TSB is also indemnified from potential future losses through mis-selling scandals such as Personal Protection Insurance, it says: Speaking to reporters now, TSB chief Paul Pester says that 15-20% of its float will probably go to small investors rather than City firms. TSB is also taking customer from \"every major bank in UK\" at present, but doesn't expect to pay a dividend until 2017. Lloyds Banking Group is defying fears of flotation fatigue in the City, by announcing plans to launch its TSB banking division on the stock market. And there will be free shares on offer to investors who take part and hold onto their stakes. The much-anticipated move will see Lloyds sell 25% of TSB to investors -- satisfying an order from the European Union to divest some assets following its merger with Halifax in the white heat of the financial crisis in 2008. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, group chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, describes the float as a \"important further step for the Group\" as it strives to to meet its commitments to the European Commission. Horta-Os\u00f3rio added: TSB has a national network of branches, a strong balance sheet and significant economic protection against legacy issues. It is already operating on the UK high street and is proving to be a strong and effective challenger, further enhancing competition in the UK banking sector.\" Small investors are welcome to take part in the flotation. And there's an interesting twist to this float -- anyone who holds onto their TSB stake for at least a year will receive one free share for each 20 they bought (up to \u00a32,000) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial market, the world economy, the eurozone and business. The EU parliament elections were a political earthquake, but the City is refusing to be shaken by the sight of anti-establishment and extremist parties making stunning gains in parts of Europe. Shares in London are expected to rise this morning, as traders return to their desks after the Bank Holiday break in the UK. UKIP's triumph in the UK, the National Front's surge in France, and even the prospect of Greece's Golden Dawn sending MEPs to Brussels, isn't spooking investors, yet anyway. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets sums up the mood in the City, on a rather dull grey morning: The weekend European elections don\u2019t appear to have had that much effect on markets despite a large anti EU vote in a number of countries, particularly in the UK, France, Greece and Denmark. The reality is that the outcome of these elections has very little bearing on what is likely to happen with respect to economic policy in the various European capitals which are striving to engineer an economic recovery, though European politicians will ignore the message being sent by voters at their peril. The London market is playing catch-up after yesterday's rally in Europe which saw the German DAX hit a new record high. That also saw the Italian FTSE MIB surging 3.5% after prime minister Matteo Renzi triumphed over Beppe Grillo. European markets are likely to dip back a little today, as Stan Shamu of IG explains: Looking ahead to European trade, the major bourses are mostly pointing lower, with the exception of the FTSE which was closed yesterday and as a result missed out on the big gains across the region. The MIB rallied quite significantly led by the banks and it is likely to be the weakest performer at the open as it gives back some of these gains. Here's IG's opening forecasts: FTSE 100, + 24 points at 6840 German DAX, -13 points at 9880 French CAC -17 points at 4510 Spanish IBEX -18 points at 10,670 Italian MIB, - 84 points at 21410 So what else is happening today?... EU leaders will be meeting in Brussels today for a regular summit meeting - a chance to digest the shoeing which many of them (but not all) received at the ballot box last weekend. They'll also be discussing who will be the next EU Commission president -- Jean-Claude Juncker has already declared victory (mario ) It's the last day of the European Central Bank' Forum on Central Banking, in Portugal. Yesterday, ECB chief Mario Draghi dropped some hints about a possible interest rate cut next week, as we reported here: Mario Draghi hints at ECB rate cut to avoid deflation Otherwise it looks a little quiet - so let me know what I've missed!",

When the governor of the Bank of England and the head of the International Monetary Fund start banging on like a couple of social democrats at a Labour party fringe meeting, it is worth paying attention. Something is up. That something is the way the world operates in the aftermath of its most profound economic shock of the postwar era. This has been a period of slow growth, rising inequality and \u2013 as the results of the elections to the European parliament show \u2013 political alienation. People struggling to cope with wages that don't keep pace with inflation feel that they are paying the price of a crisis they did not cause while the perpetrators of the crime get away scot free. Carney's message was that trust in financial markets has been strained by the self-serving and often crooked activities of the bankers. Supposedly rugged markets have in fact been rigged markets, and this needs to change through a combination of tougher regulation, reform of compensation and the willingness of bankers to realise that it is in their own long-term interests to behave more responsibly. Eyebrows were raised last autumn when Carney made what was seen as a strongly pro-City speech. This time his approach was more combative, but still broadly positive. Change was happening, the Bank of England governor said, in areas such as ensuring that banks were no longer too big to fail. Meanwhile, flooding financial markets with money through the quantitative easing programmes should not be seen as a way of boosting the value of assets held by the better off but as a means of preventing a lost generation of the young unemployed. Lagarde's offering was less optimistic but more realistic. The financial sector, she said, was doing its utmost to resist reform. There was too little progress on too-big-to-fail banks and the industry still prized short-term profit over long-term prudence. All true.

      "bodyText": "The chairman of Rightmove has sold almost half of his shares in the UK's biggest property website for \u00a37m. Scott Forbes, who has been Rightmove's chairman since 2005, sold 300,000 shares at an average price of \u00a323.50. He retained 319,300 shares in the 14-year-old company, which has a market value of \u00a32.3bn. The share sale comes as Rightmove is facing increasing competition from its main rival Zoopla \u2013 which is planning to float on the stockmarket next month \u2013 and estate agents setting up their own property portal. Zoopla, which is just six years old and includes the websites Zoopla.co.uk and Primelocation.com, last week confirmed its intention to press ahead with a \u00a31bn London flotation in June. The float could value Zoopla founder Alex Chesterman's stake at more than \u00a380m. It will be Chesterman's second big windfall after the sale of Lovefilm, which he cofounded, to Amazon for \u00a3200m in 2011. Daily Mail publisher the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT), which owns 52% of Zoopla, will also make a big return on its investment. Rightmove is also under increasing pressure from estate agents increasingly objecting to the fees to advertise on the website. The six biggest agents in London \u2013 Savills, Knight Frank, Chesterton Humberts, Strutt and Parker, Douglas &amp; Gordon and Glentree Estates \u2013 are preparing to launch their own website, Agents' Mutual, next January. More than 1,800 estate agents' offices have signed up to Agents' Mutual and the new portal has raised more than \u00a35m in seed capital from members. Agents already signed up account for 12% of properties on the market, and those representing a further 19% have expressed interest. Agents' Mutual, which is run by PrimeLocation founder Ian Springett, will ban participating agents from advertising their properties on more than one of the other big websites, meaning agents must choose between Zoopla and Rightmove. \"Our site will be the first portal fully owned by agents \u2013 this will always be the case \u2013 and it will become a serious competitor to the sites already in existence,\" Springett said. \"The site will not be driven by the need to maximise financial returns to shareholders \u2013 which has driven up listing fees for agents and consumers on some other sites \u2013 but instead to create the best high-quality property search service.\" Zoopla has offered agents shares in the company's flotation at a 20% discount to persuade them to stay loyal to the firm. Fears about the health of the property market were raised yesterday by figures from the British Bankers' Association (BBA) showing the number of mortgage approvals dropped for the third month running. The number of new loans approved by high street banks in April fell to 42,173, from 45,045 in March. Rightmove declined to explain why Forbes sold the shares, but he is understood to be in the process of buying a new house in South Kensington. It is the second time in recent months that Forbes has sold a lot of shares. In November he sold 138,729 bonus shares for \u00a33.1m. Rightmove chief executive Nick McKittrick sold \u00a36.1m worth in October. Rightmove's shares, which have fallen by 15% so far this year, closed down 6p to \u00a323.25. The shares are still worth seven times the 335p they floated at in 2006.",

      "body": "<p>The chairman of Rightmove has sold almost half of his shares in the UK's biggest property website for \u00a37m.</p> <p>Scott Forbes, who has been Rightmove's chairman since 2005, sold 300,000 shares at an average price of \u00a323.50. He retained 319,300 shares in the 14-year-old company, which has a market value of \u00a32.3bn.</p> <p>The share sale comes as Rightmove is facing increasing competition from its main rival Zoopla \u2013 which is planning to float on the stockmarket next month \u2013 and estate agents setting up their own property portal.</p> <p>Zoopla, which is just six years old and includes the websites Zoopla.co.uk and Primelocation.com, last week confirmed its intention to press ahead with a \u00a31bn London flotation in June.</p> <p>The float could value Zoopla founder Alex Chesterman's stake at more than \u00a380m. It will be Chesterman's second big windfall after the sale of Lovefilm, which he cofounded, to Amazon for \u00a3200m in 2011.</p> <p>Daily Mail publisher the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT), which owns 52% of Zoopla, will also make a big return on its investment.</p> <p>Rightmove is also under increasing pressure from estate agents increasingly objecting to the fees to advertise on the website. The six biggest agents in London \u2013 Savills, Knight Frank, Chesterton Humberts, Strutt and Parker, Douglas &amp; Gordon and Glentree Estates \u2013 are preparing to launch their own website, Agents' Mutual, next January.</p> <p>More than 1,800 estate agents' offices have signed up to Agents' Mutual and the new portal has raised more than \u00a35m in seed capital from members. Agents already signed up account for 12% of properties on the market, and those representing a further 19% have expressed interest.</p> <p>Agents' Mutual, which is run by PrimeLocation founder Ian Springett, will ban participating agents from advertising their properties on more than one of the other big websites, meaning agents must choose between Zoopla and Rightmove.</p> <p>\"Our site will be the first portal fully owned by agents \u2013 this will always be the case \u2013 and it will become a serious competitor to the sites already in existence,\" Springett said. \"The site will not be driven by the need to maximise financial returns to shareholders \u2013 which has driven up listing fees for agents and consumers on some other sites \u2013 but instead to create the best high-quality property search service.\"</p> <p>Zoopla has offered agents shares in the company's flotation at a 20% discount to persuade them to stay loyal to the firm.</p> <p>Fears about the health of the property market were raised yesterday by figures from the British Bankers' Association (BBA) showing the number of mortgage approvals dropped for the third month running. The number of new loans approved by high street banks in April fell to 42,173, from 45,045 in March.</p> <p>Rightmove declined to explain why Forbes sold the shares, but he is understood to be in the process of buying a new house in South Kensington. It is the second time in recent months that Forbes has sold a lot of shares. In November he sold 138,729 bonus shares for \u00a33.1m. Rightmove chief executive Nick McKittrick sold \u00a36.1m worth in October.</p> <p>Rightmove's shares, which have fallen by 15% so far this year, closed down 6p to \u00a323.25. The shares are still worth seven times the 335p they floated at in 2006.</p>",

    "webTitle": "TSB to float next month with teaser for small investors", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is floating 25% of its TSB subsidiary next month with up to a fifth of the shares expected to be snapped up by retail investors. To entice small shareholders, Lloyds is offering one free share for every 20 shares bought (up to \u00a32,000) if the shares are held for a year, but the standalone TSB will not issue dividends until 2017. Lloyds will sell a 25% stake in TSB initially and has to sell down the rest by the end of 2015. Some analysts now expect Lloyds to make a loss on the sale of the 200-year-old brand, with the shares likely to be priced at less than TSB's book value of \u00a31.5bn. After an abortive attempt to sell off its TSB branches to the Co-operative Group last year, Lloyds has decided to take its chances with the IPO market, which has seen a flurry of debuts this year but has shown some signs of flotation fatigue recently. Last week Saga, the over-50s holidays and insurance group, made a disappointing stock market debut, launching its shares at the bottom end of the price range amid weaker-than-expected demand. Clothing chain Fatface ditched its plans to float. Cenkos Securities analyst Sandy Chen said: \"TSB's IPO might price at a significant discount to book. Our concerns centre on profitability, both current and future.\" The bank has held two rounds of investor meetings this year to drum up interest and reckons there is good demand for the shares, in particular from the US and far east. TSB's chief executive, Paul Pester, said: \"Market conditions will affect Lloyds' decision to sell down, that's a question for them.\" But he added: \"There is a strong, a good appetite for TSB. What's attracting investors is the simple straight forward banking model \u2013 a high street, not a Wall Street bank \u2013 and it's protected from the past.\" Lloyds' chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, has promised TSB will be a \"real challenger on the high street\", describing it as a completely clean bank, untainted by the financial crisis. TSB has an indemnity from Lloyds against future misconduct charges relating to legacy issues such as the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal. Lloyds has paid out billions of pounds to compensate people who were mis-sold PPI. Pester expects some 15-20% of the first tranche of shares will go to the public. The prospectus will be published in mid-June. He admitted that TSB will not pay a dividend until 2017, disappointing investors looking for such payouts. \"We intend to invest every penny we can in retail growth,\" Pester said. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said the TSB IPO could be a \"float too far. The initial valuation has been set at around \u00a31.5bn but could well be less given that the appetite for IPOs appears to be showing some signs of waning or summer fatigue.\" Hewson noted that of the IPOs launched this year only Poundland remains above its float price. Lloyds opted for plan B after the collapse of talks with the Co-op last year \u2013 a move which would have created a 1,000-branch network and challenged the dominance of the current account market by the big four high street banks, which include Lloyds. Matthew Beesley, head of global equities at Henderson, said: \"The promise of bonus shares for loyal shareholders tells you of their need to build a following, especially with so much banking issuance to come in the next few years. Lloyds is selling 25% of TSB now with further stake sales to come in fairly short order. They face the prospect of the government selling its remaining 25% stake before the election in 12 months' time. \"Then there is RBS, with their own stake sales and the forced divestiture of their Williams &amp; Glyn branches. With the outlook for the UK economy the best it has been for seven years, at least TSB has the advantage of going first.\" With 631 branches, TSB has 6% of the UK bank branch network, but controls 4.2% of the current account market. It hopes to add to its 4.5 million existing customers, in the next five to six years and raise its market share to 6% \u2013 the level at which the Independent Commission on Banking, chaired by Sir John Vickers, concluded that a challenger bank could be a competitive force. Former Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester branches, 164 sites, are part of the package of branches rebranded as TSB since September, which used to sell only mortgages and savings but are now also offering current accounts. A new seven-day switching service for current accounts was started by the industry just as TSB was being spun out off Lloyds on to the high street. TSB has been winning new business, helped by its new Plus account that offers a 5% interest rate on the first \u00a32,000 paid into the account. Pester said he was surprised that many customers were not making use of the industry account switching service and opting to move accounts across themselves. Chen said: \"TSB intends to grow its balance sheet by 40-50% over the next five years, mainly emphasising growth in mortgages funded by growth in current accounts.

Some analysts now expect Lloyds to make a loss on the sale of the 200-year-old brand, with the shares likely to be priced at less than TSB's book value of \u00a31.5bn.</p> <p>After an abortive attempt to sell off its TSB branches to the Co-operative Group last year, Lloyds has decided to take its chances with the IPO market, which has seen a flurry of debuts this year but has shown some signs of flotation fatigue recently. Last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/21/saga-cuts-price-stock-market-flotation\" title=\"\">Saga, the over-50s holidays and insurance group, made a disappointing stock market debut</a>, launching its shares at the bottom end of the price range amid weaker-than-expected demand. Clothing chain Fatface ditched its plans to float.</p> <p>Cenkos Securities analyst Sandy Chen said: \"TSB's IPO might price at a significant discount to book. Our concerns centre on profitability, both current and future.\"</p> <p>The bank has held two rounds of investor meetings this year to drum up interest and reckons there is good demand for the shares, in particular from the US and far east. TSB's chief executive, Paul Pester, said: \"Market conditions will affect Lloyds' decision to sell down, that's a question for them.\" But he added: \"There is a strong, a good appetite for TSB. What's attracting investors is the simple straight forward banking model \u2013 a high street, not a Wall Street bank \u2013 and it's protected from the past.\"</p> <p>Lloyds' chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, has promised TSB will be a \"real challenger on the high street\", describing it as a completely clean bank, untainted by the financial crisis. TSB has an indemnity from Lloyds against future misconduct charges relating to legacy issues such as the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal. Lloyds has paid out billions of pounds to compensate people who were mis-sold PPI.</p> <p>Pester expects some 15-20% of the first tranche of shares will go to the public. The prospectus will be published in mid-June. He admitted that TSB will not pay a dividend until 2017, disappointing investors looking for such payouts. \"We intend to invest every penny we can in retail growth,\" Pester said.</p> <p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said the TSB IPO could be a \"float too far. The initial valuation has been set at around \u00a31.5bn but could well be less given that the appetite for IPOs appears to be showing some signs of waning or summer fatigue.\"</p> <p>Hewson noted that of the IPOs launched this year only Poundland remains above its float price.</p> <p>Lloyds opted for plan B after the collapse of talks with the Co-op last year \u2013 a move which would have created a 1,000-branch network and challenged the dominance of the current account market by the big four high street banks, which include Lloyds.</p> <p>Matthew Beesley, head of global equities at Henderson, said: \"The promise of bonus shares for loyal shareholders tells you of their need to build a following, especially with so much banking issuance to come in the next few years. Lloyds is selling 25% of TSB now with further stake sales to come in fairly short order. They face the prospect of the government selling its remaining 25% stake before the election in 12 months' time.</p> <p>\"Then there is RBS, with their own stake sales and the forced divestiture of their Williams &amp; Glyn branches. With the outlook for the UK economy the best it has been for seven years, at least TSB has the advantage of going first.\"</p> <p>With 631 branches, TSB has 6% of the UK bank branch network, but controls 4.2% of the current account market. It hopes to add to its 4.5 million existing customers, in the next five to six years and raise its market share to 6% \u2013 the level at which the Independent Commission on Banking, chaired by Sir John Vickers, concluded that a challenger bank could be a competitive force.</p> <p>Former Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester branches, 164 sites, are part of the package of branches rebranded as TSB since September, which used to sell only mortgages and savings but are now also offering current accounts. A new seven-day switching service for current accounts was started by the industry just as TSB was being spun out off Lloyds on to the high street. TSB has been winning new business, helped by its new Plus account that offers a 5% interest rate on the first \u00a32,000 paid into the account.</p> <p>Pester said he was surprised that many customers were not making use of the industry account switching service and opting to move accounts across themselves.</p> <p>Chen said: \"TSB intends to grow its balance sheet by 40-50% over the next five years, mainly emphasising growth in mortgages funded by growth in current accounts. But if this costs TSB 5% deposit teaser rates in order to get those current accounts, we can't see how TSB will make much money with the average 2-year fixed rate on 75% LTV [loan-to-value] mortgages standing at 2.5%.\"</p> <p>TSB was founded in 1810 in Dumfriesshire by the Rev Henry Duncan as the Trustee Savings Bank, but it disappeared from the high street 18 years ago when it was merged with Lloyds \u2013 until its comeback last autumn.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 May</p>",

Christine Lagarde told an audience in London that six years on from the deep financial crisis that engulfed the global economy, banks were resisting reform and still too focused on excessive risk taking to secure their bonuses at the expense of public trust. She said: \"The behaviour of the financial sector has not changed fundamentally in a number of dimensions since the crisis. While some changes in behaviour are taking place, these are not deep or broad enough. The industry still prizes short-term profit over long-term prudence, today's bonus over tomorrow's relationship. \"Some prominent firms have even been mired in scandals that violate the most basic ethical norms - Libor and foreign exchange rigging, money laundering, illegal foreclosure.\" Lagarde warned the too-big-to-fail problem among some of the world's largest financial institutions was still unresolved and remained a major source of systematic risk, with implicit subsidies of $70bn (\u00a342bn) in the US, and up to $300bn in the eurozone. In a speech littered with quotations from Winston Churchill to Pope Francis and Oscar Wilde, Lagarde said international progress to reform the financial system was too slow. \"The bad news is that progress is too slow, and the finish line is still too far off. Some of this arises form the sheer complexity of the task at hand. Yet, we must acknowledge that it also stems from fierce industry pushback, and from the fatigue that is bound to set in at this point in a long race.\" Lagarde told the inclusive capitalism conference that rising inequality was also a barrier to growth, and could undermine democracy and human rights. The issue has risen up the agenda in recent months with the publication of the French economist Thomas Piketty's book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century. \"One of the leading economic stories of our time is rising income inequality, and the dark shadow it casts across the global economy,\" Lagarde said. Borrowing from Oxfam research, she noted that the world's richest 85 people, who could fit into a single London double-decker bus, control the same wealth as the poorest half of the global population of 3.5 billion people. Options to address inequality include more progressive tax systems and greater use of property taxes, she said. \"We must recognise that reducing inequality is not easy. Redistributive policies always produce winners and losers. Yet if we want capitalism to do its job \u2013 enabling as many people as possible to participate and benefit from the economy \u2013 then it needs to be more inclusive. That means addressing extreme income disparity.\" Lagarde compared the rising awareness of social responsibility tied into the financial system with the world's expanding environmental consciousness. \"Just as we have a long way to go to reduce our carbon footprint, we have an even longer way to go to reduce our 'financial footprint'. Yet we must take those steps.\" \u2022 Special report: has the City learned any lessons?",
