      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest companies have been warned they face a wave of revolts in the forthcoming annual meeting season and risk a government clampdown on excessive remuneration unless they show restraint over executive pay. The Investment Association \u2013 whose members manage \u00a35.7tn of savings and investments \u2013 is ready to pounce on overly complex bonus deals and payouts that are not linked to performance. Writing for the Guardian, Chris Cummings, the IA chief executive, said: \u201cAs the starting gun is fired on this year\u2019s AGM season, businesses around the UK would do well to heed the lessons from Brexit. Too many people still feel they are not sharing in this country\u2019s prosperity. Companies can either act responsibly now and shape a more responsible 21st-century corporate Britain or they can carry on as before and have it foisted upon them.\u201d His warning comes amid signs that major investors are preparing for a lively AGM round. Royal London Asset Management, which manages \u00a3100bn of assets, intends to vote against any long-term bonus scheme which increases the potential maximum payout for company bosses. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at Royal London, said she expected to vote against proposed increases to maximum bonuses and long-term incentive plans (Ltips) which usually involved awarding executives shares as a multiple of their salary. \u201cOur default position is to say no,\u201d said Hamilton Claxton. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided we need to draw a line under the maximum increase.\u201d Bonus increases caused by executive promotions could be treated differently, she said. She also wants pay plans to be simplified. Even before the AGM season gets into full swing, shareholders have forced Imperial Brands, maker of Gauloises and John Player cigarettes, to abandon a pay deal for chief executive Alison Cooper. That enhanced bonus scheme would have increased her maximum annual pay from \u00a37.1m to \u00a38.5m. Travel company Thomas Cook has also cut the maximum bonus payout for its chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, under a new long-term bonus plan. Cummings said investors would be on alert for three warning lights: significant increases in total remuneration for executives; complex pay deals; and weak links between pay and performance. He pointed to the latter as a key factor in AGM revolts last year when oil company BP and medical services provider Smith &amp; Nephew both had pay deals voted down. Although these were advisory votes they proved bruising for the companies. Theresa May put a clampdown on corporate excess on the agenda during her campaign to become prime minister last year and a green paper outlining possible reforms was published in the wake of her victory. The outcome of the consultation is not yet known but she faced criticism for backing down from an idea to install workers on boards. Her intervention came after the coalition government gave investors a new binding vote on how a company intended to operate its pay policy for three years, in addition to the advisory vote on annual pay deals introduced by the Labour government 15 years ago. Two-thirds of the FTSE 100 leading companies will have to put their pay policies to a binding vote this year. Cummings said the number of companies which had visited the IA to discuss executive pay ahead of the AGM season had more than doubled over the last six months. \u201cThis is certainly a sign of the healthy appetite for dialogue between the boardroom and shareholders. It is also no doubt a sign of the pressure that many FTSE companies feel as a result of the PM\u2019s spotlight,\u201d said Cummings. The world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, earlier this year warned UK companies they must match boardroom pay rises with those of their workers. The Church of England, a major institutional investor, has written to the 350 biggest companies on the stock market, warning them it would vote to block excessive boardroom pay deals. Big payout at Melrose Directors at engineering turnaround specialist Melrose Industries are in line to receive shares worth more than \u00a3200m as part of a bonus scheme which is among the most generous in City history. The incentive plan, which is linked to value created for shareholders since 2012, means four top executives, including chief executive Simon Peckham, can each expect shares worth around \u00a335m. This is because directors are entitled to shares worth 7.5% of any increase in the value of Melrose, over a five-year period that ends this May. The company confirmed this would be worth about \u00a3206m to directors, based on Melrose\u2019s recent share price and adjusted for cash that shareholders have invested and taken out of the company over the past five years. Just four executives will get 68% of the total, according to the company\u2019s annual report. That means Peckham, executive chairman Christopher Miller, vice-chairman David Roper and finance director Geoffrey Martin are likely to split stock worth \u00a3140m between them. The \u00a335m each of them can expect dwarfs the \u00a323.3m received by housebuilder Berkeley\u2019s founder-chairman Tony Pidgley in 2015 but still some way below the \u00a370m deal that Sir Martin Sorrell got in the same year at advertising giant WPP. Directors can sell enough shares to cover the cost of tax on the awards but must retain at least 50% of the remaining shares for at least two years. A source close to the company said none of the directors had ever sold any of their shares in Melrose, except to satisfy tax bills. The company has also returned more than \u00a33bn to investors, who approved the pay plan in 2012, by taking over struggling engineering firms, sprucing them up and selling them on. The final details will be known when the annual report is published next month. This article was amended on 20 March 2017 to correct Alison Cooper\u2019s maximum annual pay from \u00a35.5m to \u00a37.1m.",

      "bodyText": "Delivery company UK Mail has been accused of \u201cripping off\u201d workers and using \u201cinhuman\u201d practices after it charged a courier nearly \u00a3800 when he was unable to work as a result of a car accident while on duty. The \u00a3250m business, which delivers for retailers including Tesco, Homebase and O2, billed 47-year old Emil Ibrahimov \u00a3216 on the days he could not work after a car drove into him while he was carrying parcels from the rear of his van in east London. In pain and with his leg swollen, he was taken to hospital by ambulance and told by doctors to rest and move only on crutches. But after he told his managers he could not work, UK Mail charged him, claiming it had to recoup the cost of finding a replacement courier. Ibrahimov said he lost about \u00a31,800 from taking seven days sick in the past 12 months when lost earnings and charges are added together. He has now quit. Ibrahimov spoke out to the Guardian to highlight a practice that is understood to apply across UK Mail\u2019s network of about 1,800 self-employed couriers. UK Mail made a profit of \u00a316m profit last year when it was bought out by the Deutsche Post DHL Group. The system of charges is written into the contracts of couriers who are paid per delivery. UK Mail also charged Ibrahimov when a doctor signed him off work for two weeks with acute back pain and sciatica caused by carrying heavy parcels. He went back to work after two days to avoid losses. \u201cI took my sick note in and they said it doesn\u2019t matter because I am self-employed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did this to me and they will do it to someone else tomorrow and it is not right.\u201d The charges emerged amid growing concern at the treatment of self-employed couriers who supply the booming online shopping trade. The Guardian this month revealed DPD charges drivers \u00a3150 a day if they cannot find a replacement to cover their round and Royal Mail\u2019s ParcelForce charges self-employed couriers up to \u00a3250 a day if they cannot find cover. On Wednesday, couriers at DPD\u2019s Edinburgh depot staged a walkout after they were told they needed to work six days a week and in protest against charges. Such charges are to be scrutinised by the Downing Street-commissioned review into modern employment practices led by Matthew Taylor. Frank Field, the chair of the Commons work and pensions select committee, said he would press Taylor \u201cto look closely at this rip-off practice which again shows how the odds are stacked against the low paid in Britain\u2019s gig economy\u201d. Taylor said: \u201cIt is important that controversial practices in the modern labour market are made visible so that we can understand key challenges we need to address in our review.\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said UK Mail\u2019s \u201cpunitive fines\u201d were \u201ca stark example of an employer reaping all the benefits of the gig economy, while the worker bears all the risk\u201d. She added: \u201cThose in low-paid \u2018self-employment\u2019 pay a heavy price for falling sick. We need to crack down on bosses who do this.\u201d When a courier is sick, UK Mail pays them the amount earned by the replacement courier \u2013 in Ibrahimov\u2019s case between \u00a324 and \u00a399 a day. But it also charges them whatever it costs to hire a replacement, which it said was \u00a3216 a day. For Ibrahimov it meant a net loss of \u00a3789 while he recovered from his work injury. UK Mail denied it was ripping off workers. A spokesman said: \u201cSubcontractors are made aware of the commercial nature of the agreement from the outset. \u201cUK Mail hasn\u2019t profited out of this. They are simply covering the cost they have incurred finding cover for rounds.\u201d Tesco said it was \u201cdisappointed to hear of the treatment of this individual\u201d, and O2 said it would \u201cspeak to UK Mail to understand more about their business operations for their self-employed drivers\u201d. Homebase declined to comment. Ibrahimov came to the UK from Azerbaijan six years ago and worked for UK Mail for two years, being paid per delivery stop. He said he typically worked five 12-hour days each week which, after expenses, saw him earn the equivalent under \u00a37 an hour. The national minimum wage for over-24s is \u00a37.20 but it does not apply to self-employed workers. \u201cEvery day they were calling saying come to work,\u201d Ibrahimov said of the aftermath of his car accident. \u201cI would say I couldn\u2019t and they would say I was going to be charged. So after a few days I had to go back. It was very painful but I had to go. It is inhuman because this happened while I was doing their job. The car accident didn\u2019t stress me out as much as what UK Mail did afterwards.\u201d UK Mail declined to comment on Ibrahimov\u2019s case but said: \u201cUK Mail only ever passes on the actual costs incurred, which is in line with the contract with the driver and with company policy. \u201cOn the rare occasions where a subcontractor fails to provide the agreed service by not making sure adequate cover is in place, UK Mail may be forced to make alternative arrangements \u2026 which are sometimes more expensive because of the short notice given. \u2026 UK Mail considers any such event individually.\u201d",

But it also charges them whatever it costs to hire a replacement, which it said was \u00a3216 a day. For Ibrahimov it meant a net loss of \u00a3789 while he recovered from his work injury.</p> <p>UK Mail denied it was ripping off workers. A spokesman said: \u201cSubcontractors are made aware of the commercial nature of the agreement from the outset.</p> <p>\u201cUK Mail hasn\u2019t profited out of this. They are simply covering the cost they have incurred finding cover for rounds.\u201d</p> <p>Tesco said it was \u201cdisappointed to hear of the treatment of this individual\u201d, and O2 said it would \u201cspeak to UK Mail to understand more about their business operations for their self-employed drivers\u201d. Homebase declined to comment.</p> <p>Ibrahimov came to the UK from Azerbaijan six years ago and worked for UK Mail for two years, being paid per delivery stop. He said he typically worked five 12-hour days each week which, after expenses, saw him earn the equivalent under \u00a37 an hour. The national minimum wage for over-24s is \u00a37.20 but it does not apply to self-employed workers.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day they were calling saying come to work,\u201d Ibrahimov said of the aftermath of his car accident. \u201cI would say I couldn\u2019t and they would say I was going to be charged. So after a few days I had to go back. It was very painful but I had to go. It is inhuman because this happened while I was doing their job. The car accident didn\u2019t stress me out as much as what UK Mail did afterwards.\u201d</p> <p>UK Mail declined to comment on Ibrahimov\u2019s case but said: \u201cUK Mail only ever passes on the actual costs incurred, which is in line with the contract with the driver and with company policy.</p> <p>\u201cOn the rare occasions where a subcontractor fails to provide the agreed service by not making sure adequate cover is in place, UK Mail may be forced to make alternative arrangements \u2026 which are sometimes more expensive because of the short notice given. \u2026 UK Mail considers any such event individually.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Unilever is drawing up plans to heal a rift among shareholders triggered by its rejection of a $143bn (\u00a3115bn) bid from Kraft Heinz, amid a warning that Britain could become home to \u201ca garage sale\u201d unless there is protection for domestic companies from foreign takeovers. Next month the owner of Dove soap and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream will announce the results of a review aimed at improving investor returns, with the sale of its spreads business and a one-off special dividend among the options being considered. But the company also remains committed to fending off any renewal of Kraft Heinz\u2019s interest, which comes amid support from the former City minister Paul Myners. Lord Myners, who chaired Marks &amp; Spencer when it fought off a bid from the BHS tycoon Sir Philip Green, upbraided the prime minister for not doing enough to \u201cprotect prize assets\u201d in an editorial for the Sunday Telegraph. Myners warned that a string of major British companies could become the subject of a \u201cgarage sale\u201d unless the government takes steps to prevent it. The comments come just days after Unilever\u2019s chief executive, Paul Polman, expressed support for changes to the takeover code governing corporate deals, to make it easier to protect a \u201cnational champion\u201d such as Unilever. Richard Buxton, chief executive of Old Mutual Global Investors, lent support to Polman in a letter to the Sunday Times, urging him not to \u201csuccumb to the pressures of short-termism\u201d. But Polman is also understood to be aware that he must also appease a sizeable faction of shareholders who disagree with Buxton \u2013 who does not own Unilever shares \u2013 and want to see radical plans to boost their returns. One option under consideration is the sale of the group\u2019s underperforming spreads business, which includes household names such as Flora and Stork. Private equity groups including CVC and Bain Capital are weighing up plans for a \u00a36bn bid for the division, according to reports, while Kraft Heinz could also target the business as a less ambitious alternative to its bid for the entire company. The company is also pondering raising up to $15bn to fund medium-sized acquisitions and a sizeable special dividend or buyback to pacify more fractious investors. A combination of these measures is thought to be the company\u2019s preferred strategy to protect its independence while allaying the concerns of shareholders who wanted Unilever to consider Kraft\u2019s bid. A survey by the investment house Bernstein suggested that investors are split down the middle over the \u201caggressive rejection\u201d of Kraft\u2019s overtures, with half believing the company should have held talks with the US company. Unilever has said it believes support for its defence is actually higher than that.",

      "bodyText": "When Theresa May stood on the steps of Downing Street last July, looking down the barrel of the world\u2019s TV cameras to address the nation for the first time as prime minister, she put reform of executive pay at the heart of her plan to shape a Britain that works for all, not a privileged few. As the annual general meeting season approaches, all eyes will be on investors and whether they rise up to this challenge in a \u201cshareholder spring\u201d. That renewed government focus on corporate governance is timely. The previous coalition government made big inroads into empowering investors to hold company boards to account, including giving them a binding vote on pay deals for the coming three years. For two-thirds of the FTSE 100, 2017 marks the third anniversary of a binding shareholder vote on what the UK\u2019s largest companies pay their top team. This binding vote is a very powerful tool which gives investors \u2013 those firms who ultimately look after your and my pension or savings \u2013 the power to hold companies to account on what they pay their senior executives. This year those very same companies will have yet again to seek approval from shareholders for their executives\u2019 pay packages for the next three years, so they can\u2019t tinker with it each year. As you would expect, many of those companies have been at pains to explain to shareholders how they are justifying their top team\u2019s pay. The number of companies which have come to talk to the Investment Association \u2013 which represents many of those long-term shareholders and highlights investor concerns ahead of the company\u2019s AGM \u2013 has more than doubled in the last six months. This is certainly a sign of the healthy appetite for dialogue between the boardroom and shareholders. It is also no doubt a sign of the pressure that many FTSE companies feel as a result of the PM\u2019s spotlight. This is of course a good thing for savers and pensioners around the country. In many cases, shareholder engagement has led to significant changes to a company\u2019s proposals on pay, with a number of the largest companies in the UK reducing future executive pay packets as a result. So far we have seen the tobacco giant Imperial Brands being forced to withdraw its remuneration policy vote at its AGM due to lack of shareholder support. The tour operator Thomas Cook agreed to restrict its pay structure following a large protest vote from shareholders. This year, shareholders will have three main areas under the microscope. The first is company director pay and whether significant increases are planned in future remuneration for executives. A number of companies still do not get how strong public sentiment is on what many perceived to be excessive top management pay. The second issue is how that top pay is awarded and simplified, as some of the current pay structures are so complex that it makes shareholder scrutiny harder. Lastly and most importantly, is the key link between pay and company performance. Last year, two FTSE 100 companies \u2013 BP and medical services provider Smith &amp; Nephew \u2013 failed to win the majority investor support because of a lack of link between pay and performance. They will have to resubmit their pay policy to shareholders for scrutiny this year. Investors rightly want rewards that reflects the overall performance of a company. And they are empowered to vote against those rewards if they believe this is not the case. As the starting gun is fired on this year\u2019s AGM season, businesses around the UK would do well to heed the lessons from Brexit. Too many people still feel they are not sharing in this country\u2019s prosperity. Companies can either act responsibly now and shape a more responsible 21st-century corporate Britain or they can carry on as before and have it foisted upon them. If there is one thing the PM was clear about as she addressed working families on the steps of No 10 last summer, it is that she wants things to change. \u2022 Chris Cummings is chief executive of the Investment Association",

      "bodyText": "Brexit has turned Britain into a nation of trade nerds. In the past nine months, trade has gone from being too boring to mention into a subject about which everybody has a view. Those who eyes would once have glazed over at the mention of bound tariffs or trade facilitation agreements can now wax lyrical about what it would mean for Britain if it had to rely on World Trade Organistion rules after it leaves the EU. The new sexiness of trade was illustrated last week when the former head of the WTO made a speech at the Institute for Government in London. Pascal Lamy spent some of the best years of his life struggling to polish off the Doha round of trade liberalisation and an overspill room was needed to hear what he had to say about Britain\u2019s likely post-Brexit deal. Battle-scarred as he is, Lamy has no illusions about the difficulties of the negotiations that will follow the triggering of article 50 by the government later this month. He had a nice metaphor for the likely complexity of the talks: separating an egg from an omelette. And a warning born of experience: it won\u2019t be achieved within two years. Lamy divided the issues facing the negotiators into three categories: things that will be simple; things that will be more complex; and things that will be really complex. In what might come as a surprise to the UK\u2019s new army of trade experts, Lamy said the creation of a free trade deal would be simple. It was a \u201cno brainer\u201d that there would be zero tariffs so that integrated supply chains did not suffer. It would also be easy enough for the UK to keep the trade with countries that have signed bilateral agreements with the EU. Fishing could also turn out to be less difficult than expected if the EU and the UK maintained mutual access for their fleets. Lamy then outlined a few of the more complex issues. The EU has defences to protect against the dumping of goods at below global market prices. It also has rules governing the state aid that member countries can provide to their domestic firms and a public procurement regime that allows German companies to bid for government contracts in the UK. There are competition laws, a common EU approach to environmental standards, and to climate change. The EU negotiators will say that a free trade deal with the UK cannot happen if Westminster wants to tilt the playing field in favour of British companies through state aid or public procurement. Nor would the EU be willing to see any dilution of its regulations that set the technical standards for goods that can be sold across the single market. This, Lamy said, is where the issues become really complex. It is one thing, he added, to have a trade deal that is tariff-free and quota-free, but the EU has tough product standards. \u201cThat\u2019s a major problem unless the UK agrees systematically to follow the continental standards,\u201d Lamy said. Agreeing to match a constantly evolving EU regime without having any say in making the new rules would likely prove politically unacceptable to the UK government. Other issues that were likely to cause problems were tax, intellectual property protection and the departure of the UK from European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). Tax is a particularly tricky issue because outside the EU it would be open to Britain to make radical changes to VAT. The boost to export competitiveness since Brexit is a demonstration of how the UK already has more monetary policy flexibility than those EU countries inside the eurozone: the EU 27 will want assurances that Philip Hammond and his successors will not exploit fiscal flexibility as well. The recent history of trade talks suggests Lamy is right when he says the less obvious stuff will be the toughest to resolve. The negotiations between Washington and Brussels for a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) ran into difficulties primarily because agreeing common technical standards is a long and arduous business. It had little to do with tariffs, which are already low. Likewise, trade negotiations \u2013 whether at a bilateral or multilateral level \u2013 are now dominated by arguments about intellectual property rights. So when Lamy says it might take five or six years for the UK and the EU to finalise a deal, that seems a reasonable estimate. One way of shortening the process would be for the UK to declare unilateral free trade no matter what the EU does. Another would be to take a leaf out of Donald Trump\u2019s book and turn more protectionist. Lamy\u2019s analysis suggests a third option is possible, though not easy. The UK would not be a member of the single market or the customs union but it would get a free trade deal with the EU. That would mean Britain would not be subject to free movement of labour \u2013 the big prize for Theresa May in the negotiations. But this would come at a price. The UK government would not have a free hand when it came to state aid or tax. It would have to accept EU regulations, not just now but in the future as well. Would this be an acceptable deal? Perhaps not to the ultras on either side. There might be some across the Channel who would consider this as not tough enough on Britain. There are certainly some free-market zealots who believe one of the big advantages of Brexit is that it will lead to a bonfire of EU regulations. Yet, as Lamy pointed out, anything that has costs for the UK has costs for the EU27 as well. And these are costs the Italian, Greek, Portuguese, French, Finnish and even German economies could do without. The UK government, for its part, would have to consider whether such a deal would be sellable to the public. It probably would be. Brexit happened because of concerns about immigration not because voters wanted the freedom to have dirtier beaches or less safe nuclear power stations. It will take time to arrive at this sort of compromise because negotiations always begin with both sides insisting that they get everything they want. It will prove impossible if there is no give and take. Jeremy Browne, the former Liberal Democrat MP who is now the City of London\u2019s special representative to the EU, said at the Lamy talk that the result of the referendum meant Brexit had to happen but that there was no reason why it should be as acrimonious as some are expecting. \u201cNegotiations normally start with a dysfunctional relationship. But this [the relationship between the UK and the EU] is a functioning relationship. The question is how much dysfunctionality do the politicians wish to inject?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The best defence against a bid is a high share price. So congratulations to Unilever, whose shares have improved by 20% since the day before Kraft Heinz turned up offering to buy the maker of Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise and Magnum ice-creams. In the event, Unilever blew Kraft Heinz\u2019s \u00a3115bn proposal out of the water within 48 hours. Fury from the boardroom, plus Kraft\u2019s belated realisation that it was walking into a storm, did the trick. But Unilever has wasted little time in moving to protect itself better. It has pledged to \u201ccapture more quickly the value we see\u201d \u2013 which usually means running the business harder and ensuring the backdoor is not left ajar for opportunistic bidders. One way of looking at this is to say Unilever would have won anyway. If it can improve its share price by a fifth just by promising to hurry up, expectations for a fair takeover price might have run beyond Kraft\u2019s ability to pay. Yet that is surely naive. If Kraft, egged on by banks willing to lend colossal sums, had pushed the premium to 35%-40%, Unilever\u2019s 100-year-long independence would probably have been over. Fund managers would have declared their admiration for Unilever chief Paul Polman and his social responsibility agenda. But then they would have explained that their own fiduciary duties obliged them not to look gift horses in the mouth. In no time, Unilever\u2019s shareholder register would have been populated by merger arbitrage funds. The target could have been served up neatly, as Cadbury was to Kraft in 2010. Just capitalism in action, it might be argued \u2013 no point being squeamish. Kraft may be an unlovely maker of processed cheese backed by a Brazilian billionaire with a well-developed appetite for ripping out costs, but Unilever is a commercial enterprise too. Yet that line is too simplistic, for the reasons Theresa May gave in her speech launching her leadership campaign last summer. \u201cAs we saw when Cadbury\u2019s \u2013 that great Birmingham company \u2013 was bought by Kraft, or when AstraZeneca was almost sold to Pfizer, transient shareholders, who are mostly companies investing other people\u2019s money, are not the only people with an interest when firms are sold or close,\u201d she said. \u201cWorkers have a stake, local communities have a stake, and often the whole country has a stake.\u201d After a statement like that, it would have been hard for May to be agnostic about Kraft\u2019s offer. Jorge Paulo Lemann, founder of 3G Capital, Kraft\u2019s principal shareholder, runs a takeover machine that extracts short-term value then looks for its next target. Unilever prizes long-term investment, sustainability and protection of the environment. The cultures are polar opposites. For anyone who believes \u201ctransient shareholders\u201d should not monopolise the debate, a takeover would have been a disaster. But May could have done virtually nothing: the government\u2019s powers are limited to areas of financial stability, national security and media plurality. She needs to understand that if even well-run companies like Unilever can be seen as vulnerable, the takeover game has changed. Debt is cheap, fund managers are judged on quarterly performance and 3G\u2019s style of short-termism is fashionable and formidable. The UK, with the world\u2019s most open takeover regime, will be an obvious port of call. That is not a Brexit point, just a recognition that shareholder-first capitalism has rarely enjoyed such favourable conditions. May does not need to go so far as offering protected status for \u201cnational champions,\u201d as Polman seemed to suggest last week. But she must realise that merely extending the government\u2019s reach to areas of \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d as ministers have suggested, is too weak. She should order a full review of the UK\u2019s takeover rules and consider a public interest test. It is not anti-capitalist to say so; rather, it is to recognise that companies operate within society. Sometimes the long-term interests of society must be able to trump the short-term interests of here-today-gone-tomorrow shareholders. Man from the Pru may find the HSBC juggernaut is hard to drive Mark Tucker has six months to write his to-do list in preparation for becoming chairman of HSBC. Finding somewhere to live \u2013 with a \u00a3300,000 relocation package to smooth his return to the UK from Hong Kong, where he has been running insurer AIA \u2013 will be his personal priority. Finding a new chief executive will be his professional priority. Tucker, a former pro footballer who is best known in the UK for his lengthy career at insurer Prudential \u2013 punctuated by a short stint as finance director of banking group HBOS \u2013 should move fast. The current incumbent, Stuart Gulliver, wants out by next year, and Tucker will no doubt grasp the opportunity to install his own person in one of the most challenging boardroom roles in Britain. Tucker is the first outsider to become chairman in the bank\u2019s 151-year history and his handover period will be just one month \u2013 a clear signal he does not intend to mess around. Tucker will have two other major tasks. The first is to clean up a bank embroiled in legal battles across the world. The $1.9bn fine imposed in 2012 for breaching US sanctions still looms large: a monitor installed by the US Department of Justice to oversee the bank\u2019s attempts to improve its compliance functions is still there. He\u2019s US lawyer Michael Cherkasky and is continuing to voice concerns: Tucker must keep a laser focus on this issue if the monitor is to depart on schedule next year. The second task is to boost shareholder returns in a business that employs 266,000 people in 70 countries. HSBC\u2019s shares have been on a rollercoaster ride since Gulliver and departing chairman Douglas Flint took charge six years ago, and are little changed from where they started out. The outgoing pair have tried to cut costs, pull back from the bank\u2019s riskiest businesses and centralise operations to try to avoid the regulatory clashes of the past. Tucker needs to find a way to inject energy into the HSBC juggernaut without piling on risk. This is no easy task. A comedown and a comeback: Green\u2019s birthday bash Sir Philip Green\u2019s return to public life this week, via a 65th birthday party at the Dorchester hotel, was a modest affair befitting a reputation that is only just emerging from a solid Ratnering over the past 12 months. There were no Mediterranean islands, no togas, no Stevie Wonder and no Leonardo DiCaprio. Instead, attendees turned up in straightforward evening attire and the guest list included Tess Daly and Jamie Redknapp \u2013 with the dependable Kate Moss delivering the only A-list name. The fact that any event was held at all \u2013 and that the following day\u2019s press coverage was not laced with scorn \u2013 shows that Green\u2019s rehabilitation has started. Nonetheless, observe the workaday clothing, the B-list attendees, and the untropical surroundings of traffic-choked Park Lane. Sir Philip is back in the room. But it is a smaller room.",

The current incumbent, Stuart Gulliver, wants out by next year, and Tucker will no doubt grasp the opportunity to install his own person in one of the most challenging boardroom roles in Britain.</p> <p>Tucker is the first outsider to become chairman in the bank\u2019s 151-year history and his handover period will be just one month \u2013 a clear signal he does not intend to mess around.</p> <p>Tucker will have two other major tasks. The first is to clean up a bank embroiled in legal battles across the world. The $1.9bn fine imposed in 2012 for breaching US sanctions still looms large: a monitor installed by the US Department of Justice to oversee the bank\u2019s attempts to improve its compliance functions is still there. He\u2019s US lawyer Michael Cherkasky and is continuing to voice concerns: Tucker must keep a laser focus on this issue if the monitor is to depart on schedule next year.</p> <p>The second task is to boost shareholder returns in a business that employs 266,000 people in 70 countries. HSBC\u2019s shares have been on a rollercoaster ride since Gulliver and departing chairman Douglas Flint took charge six years ago, and are little changed from where they started out. The outgoing pair have tried to cut costs, pull back from the bank\u2019s riskiest businesses and centralise operations to try to avoid the regulatory clashes of the past.</p> <p>Tucker needs to find a way to inject energy into the HSBC juggernaut without piling on risk. This is no easy task.</p> <h2>A comedown and a comeback: Green\u2019s birthday bash</h2> <p>Sir Philip Green\u2019s return to public life this week, via a 65th birthday party at the Dorchester hotel, was a modest affair befitting a reputation that is only just emerging from a solid Ratnering over the past 12 months. There were no Mediterranean islands, no togas, no Stevie Wonder and no Leonardo DiCaprio. Instead, attendees turned up in straightforward evening attire and the guest list included Tess Daly and Jamie Redknapp \u2013 with the dependable Kate Moss delivering the only A-list name.</p> <p>The fact that any event was held at all \u2013 and that the following day\u2019s press coverage was not laced with scorn \u2013 shows that Green\u2019s rehabilitation has started.</p> <p>Nonetheless, observe the workaday clothing, the B-list attendees, and the untropical surroundings of traffic-choked Park Lane. Sir Philip is back in the room. But it is a smaller room.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For the first few months after his election, Donald Trump was cast by many in the financial markets as the reincarnation of Ronald Reagan. His plans for deep and widespread tax cuts and a bonfire of regulations would, they said, spark a business renaissance akin to that credited to the stetson-wearing president who dominated the 1980s. Stock market investors lapped up Trump\u2019s speeches and tweets, and sent the main New York share indices to fresh highs. Last October, before the US election, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was chugging sideways below 18,000. By the first week of March, its value had topped 21,000, a rise of almost 17%. Now the market is moving sideways again \u2013 and for the simple reason that, after watching and listening to Trump since his inauguration, it has priced in most of the gains investors believe he can make for them, which over the next few years will still be bountiful, but decidedly more modest than first predicted. That\u2019s why America\u2019s central banker, Janet Yellen, the head of the Federal Reserve, made it clear last week that US interest rates would rise to at most 1.5% this year. The Federal Reserve increased its base rate range to between 0.75% and 1% at its March meeting, and Yellen said there would probably be just two more quarter-point rises this year. She was under pressure from Republicans to signal a more rapid increase, but was clear in her view that a Trump boom is still just a twinkle in the former property developer\u2019s eye. A study by consultancy Oxford Economics illustrates why the markets have joined the Fed in adopting a more cautious stance. It argues that Reagan entered office in a deeper hole and therefore had more room to expand. To boost growth, Reagan could also pull levers that are beyond Trump\u2019s grasp. In 1981, the global economy was adjusting to the two oil price shocks of the 1970s. The US was in recession and unemployment and inflation were high. Reagan\u2019s cabinet spent much of its time talking about tax cuts and a radical overhaul of corporate and labour laws to set business free, but, as Oxford Economics point out, they mostly switched on the public spending taps. It was a Keynesian boost that put money in people\u2019s pockets and invited them to spend it. \u201cFrom 1982 to 1986,\u201d says the report, \u201cthe budget deficit rose from 1.8% of GDP to around 4.5% of GDP \u2013 an overall stimulus approaching 3% of GDP, which was sustained over four years. Government investment growth hit double digits in 1984-85, including a major rise in defence spending.\u201d Jobs were created and imports rocketed. The budget deficit and the balance of trade worsened. The dollar soared. Paul Volker, Reagan\u2019s Fed chief, increased interest rates to quell domestic inflation. To emphasise how different things are now, the Fed raised rates last week, aware that, like the stock markets, the dollar had already run out of steam. It hit a 14-year high against a basket of currencies in November, but has since tracked downwards. \u201cThe prospects for dollar gains on a similar scale to the 1980s look thin,\u201d the report goes on. \u201cThe dollar was weak in 1980 but has seen strong gains since 2014 and may be moderately overvalued. And while we think the dollar is more sensitive to small rises in rate [differences with other economies] than previously, that sensitivity cuts both ways and quite a lot is arguably already priced into markets in terms of Fed rate hikes. So we expect dollar gains from here to be modest.\u201d Oxford Economics argues that a cap on the dollar is not only a boon for US consumers, who will see imported inflation peak at a lower level, but will also help economies such as Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia, which must borrow in dollars at rates set by the Fed. Much of the pain created by Reagan\u2019s policies was exported to countries that relied on selling commodities to the west. Turkey will still suffer from higher borrowing costs, but its finance ministry will be relieved to find that the extremes of the Reagan era can be avoided. The lesson for the UK is that Tory claims for deregulation as a route to riches have no precedent, not even from the Reagan era. Tax cuts can help, but both this government and the last have found themselves imposing more taxes than they cut, to a point where the ratio of tax income to GDP is at its highest in 30 years. Reagan borrowed to spend, much to the disappointment of his free market friends, adding 3% of GDP to the US budget deficit. Such generosity with borrowed money is not an option for Philip Hammond, at least not on the scale used in 1980s America. All Hammond can hope for is that the assessment of recent weeks that Trump is a benign force, who will neither emulate Reagan nor be a disaster, turns out to be true. Given the parlous state of the UK\u2019s public finances after eight years of austerity, he needs all the help he can get.",
