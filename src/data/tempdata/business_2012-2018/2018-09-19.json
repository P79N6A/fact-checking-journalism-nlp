      "bodyText": "The boss of Denmark\u2019s biggest bank has resigned after admitting that the vast majority of \u20ac200bn (\u00a3178bn) flowing through its Estonian branch was money-laundered cash flowing illegally out of Russia, the UK and the British Virgin Islands. \u201cIt is clear that Danske Bank has failed to live up to its responsibility in the case of possible money laundering in Estonia. I deeply regret this,\u201d Thomas Borgen said in his resignation statement on Wednesday. The bank said an independent investigation had found \u201ca series of major deficiencies\u201d in its controls to prevent money laundering. The investigation found that more than half of Danske\u2019s 15,000 customers in Estonia were suspicious. \u201cWe have gone through 6,200 customers starting with the customers hitting most risk indicators first,\u201d the bank said. \u201cAlmost all of these customers have been reported to the authorities.\u201d The investigation found that several dozen of its employees may have colluded with customers to get around background and security checks. The bank said it had reported some of its employees and former employees to the Estonian police. The bank\u2019s chairman, Ole Andersen, said the scandal was a \u201ca deplorable matter\u201d. \u201cThe findings of the investigations point to some very unacceptable and unpleasant matters at our Estonian branch, and they also point to the fact that a number of controls at the group level were inadequate in relation to Estonia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take the task of combating financial crime and money laundering very seriously, and we do and will do everything it takes to ensure that we never find ourselves in the same situation again.\u201d Danske only admitted to the true extent of the money laundering scandal on Wednesday following increasing political pressure and US law enforcement agencies this week launching an investigation. Borgen, who was in charge of Danske\u2019s international operations (including Estonia) before he became CEO in 2013, had previously dismissed other executives\u2019 concerns about Russian transactions in Estonia. In a 2010 investigation Borgen said he had not \u201ccome across anything that could give rise to concern\u201d. The independent report by Danish law firm Bruun &amp; Hjejle on Wednesday found that under Borgen\u2019s leadership the Estonian branch had failed to disclosure the full situation to Danske\u2019s board. Borgen said on Wednesday that the law firm had not found him to have breached the law. \u201cEven though the investigation conducted by the external law firm concludes that I have lived up to my legal obligations, I believe that it is best for all parties that I resign,\u201d he said. Estonia\u2019s Financial Supervision Authority (FSA) said it was examining the findings of the investigation. \u201cThe report describes serious shortcomings in the organisation of Danske Bank, where risk appetite and risk control were not in balance,\u201d Kilvar Kessler, the chairman of the Estonian FSA, said. Bill Browder, a US hedge fund manager who has been leading a crusade against corruption and money laundering by rich and powerful Russians, has claimed that Danske\u2019s Estonian branch was involved in the fraud uncovered by his lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who was beaten to death in a Russia jail. Danske said it would donate all its profits earned from the suspicious accounts between 2007 and 2015 to a charity focused on \u201ccombating international financial crime\u201d. The donation totals 1.5bn Danish kroner (\u00a3178m). Analysts expect Danske to be fined billions of dollars by Danish, European and US regulators. Dutch bank ING earlier this month paid a \u20ac775m fine to settle an investigation that it had failed to detect money laundering. Last year Deutsche Bank was fined almost $700m for helping wealthy Russians move about $10bn out of the country. Credit rating agency Standard and Poor\u2019s has warned Denmark that the scandal may lead it to cutting the country\u2019s AAA credit rating.",

      "bodyText": "A regulator\u2019s report into the travel chaos that left thousands of passengers stranded earlier this year has criticised the rail industry, concluding that \u201cnobody took charge\u201d even when it became clear months before the biggest ever changes to UK timetables that the project was in serious trouble. In an interim report into the timetable debacle, the Office of Road and Rail (ORR) singled out the train operators Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) and Northern, Network Rail and the Department for Transport (DfT) for criticism, saying their mistakes had led to the \u201ccollapse\u201d of services. The ORR chairman, Stephen Glaister, said: \u201cGood intentions and over-optimism within the rail industry about its ability to recover missed deadlines left no time to uncover and fix problems. In the event the operators were overwhelmed. They had made insufficient provision to help people in the event that things went wrong.\u201d The ORR\u2019s interim report was published as the DfT launched a \u201croot and branch\u201d review of the UK rail network. The former British Airways chief executive Keith Williams will lead an examination of Britain\u2019s rail network, which the transport minister, Chris Grayling, admitted was \u201cno longer fit to meet today\u2019s challenges\u201d. However, the DfT ruled out reversing privatisation, which it said had led to a doubling of passengers to 1.73 billion last year and record annual investment of \u00a35.6bn. The review follows a litany of rail crises, including the renationalisation of the East Coast line for the second time in 10 years, delays caused by strikes and engineering works, and a summer of misery for passengers as new timetables that took effect on 20 May caused mass cancellations across the north of England and on commuter lines into London. Glaister said Network Rail\u2019s timetable planning department did notice that a problem was developing with the May timetable changes. \u201cBut they did not take sufficient action to manage the risks or the consequences,\u201d he added. \u201cThe present industry arrangements do not support clarity of decision making: it was unclear who was responsible for what. Nobody took charge.\u201d He said there were several \u201ccritical points \u2026 where, had different decisions been taken, the subsequent disruption could have been avoided or significantly mitigated\u201d. The ORR blamed the train operators Govia Thameslink Railway and Northern for being badly prepared for the timetable changes and not doing enough to keep passengers informed of disruption. The rail regulator also criticised the DfT and itself for failing to question the industry\u2019s assurances about the risk of disruption. The ORR concluded that the rail industry had \u201cplaced engineering and planning concerns ahead of serving its passengers, and that was made worse by the poor information train operators provided when disruption happened\u201d. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, said: \u201cThey [train companies] do not employ enough drivers to run the services they promise in their franchise applications to deliver and they started driver training far too late. The DfT was, as usual, asleep at the wheel and Network Rail was behind on track enhancements.\u201d Shortly after the ORR published its report, the DfT confirmed plans for a full-scale review of Britain\u2019s railways, with the aim of introducing reforms by 2020. Grayling said: \u201cPrivatisation has delivered huge benefits of [sic] passengers on Britain\u2019s railways \u2013 doubling passenger journeys and bringing in billions of private investment. But it is clear that the structure we inherited is no longer fit to meet today\u2019s challenges and cope with increasing customer demand.\u201d The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: \u201cRail passengers don\u2019t need another review from the Tories to tell them that rail is broken. Another review is meaningless in a year of rocketing fares, failing franchises and timetabling chaos. Another review lets Chris Grayling off the hook. The railways need a Labour government which will deliver public ownership of rail.\u201d The Williams review will look at \u201cbringing track and train closer together\u201d, indicating a potential overhaul of the system \u2013 introduced with the privatisation of British Rail in 1994 \u2013 under which Network Rail manages the infrastructure used by private train operating companies. The DfT said the review would look at how government \u201ceffectively balances public and private sector involvement\u201d, adding that it would consider adjusting the existing franchise model, where private firms bid to run regional routes. It will also consider ways to ensure that rail fares, set to rise by up to 3.2% next year, can achieve value for money, and seek to smooth industrial relations in the wake of a series of strikes on services operated by companies, including Southern, Northern and Merseyrail. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail industry, called for the review to be as wide ranging as possible, examining \u201cevery part of the railway and focused on what works best for consumers and taxpayers\u201d. He said: \u201cThis review is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for the wide-ranging and independent thinking our railway needs and we stand ready to play our part to make sure it delivers big, bold, meaningful reform in the national interest.\u201d The rail industry has been rocked by a series of fiascos during 2018, including the decision in May to renationalise the East Coast line on a temporary basis after the operators Virgin and Stagecoach could no longer honour the promised payments to the government in the \u00a33.3bn contract. Later the same month the introduction of new timetables led to chaotic scenes as thousands of passengers were left stranded by cancellations. The disruption, which affected passengers on the Northern and Thameslink routes particularly badly, was among the factors that led to punctuality on Britain\u2019s rail networks slumping to a 12-year low in August.",

      "bodyText": "The head of the World Trade Organization has pledged to mediate between the US and China as fears grow that the escalating trade conflict between the world\u2019s two biggest economies could lead to a full-scale global trade war. Roberto Azev\u00eado, the WTO\u2019s director general, said his Geneva-based body had \u201cdedicated itself\u201d to forcing Washington and Beijing into a dialogue. Speaking at an event in Rio de Janeiro, Azev\u00eado said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d at the prospect of a trade war between the two countries. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s over. They have lots of ammunition and it can expand to other areas beyond just tariffs ... and trade.\u201d He did not elaborate. Azev\u00eado\u2019s move came as financial markets responded positively to signs that China wants to halt the drift towards protectionism, with the latest round of tit-for-tat tariffs imposed this week. Li Keqiang, the Chinese premier, used a keynote speech to a meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Chinese port of Tianjin to seek to portray his country as the defender of open markets. \u201cIt is essential that we uphold the basic principles of multilateralism and free trade,\u201d Li said. \u201cNo unilateralism will offer a viable solution.\u201d Li also warned that the world economy stood at \u201ca crossroads, with a choice between globalisation or deglobalisation\u201d. He pledged China would do its bit by opening up \u201cat a faster pace\u201d. China\u2019s second most important politician also insisted that Beijing had not been deliberately weakening its currency to make its exports weaker, and had no intention of manipulating the yuan downwards in the future either. \u201cRecent fluctuations in the renminbi [yuan] exchange rate have been seen as an intentional measure, but that isn\u2019t true, Li said. \u201cOne-way devaluation will do more harm than good to China\u2019s economy. China will by no means stimulate exports by devaluing the yuan.\u201d Li\u2019s speech was seen as the latest attempt by China to take the heat out of the trade dispute. This week, Beijing responded to Donald Trump\u2019s plan to impose tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods with its own list of $60bn of US products to be targeted, in a much milder response than had been expected. Throughout Trump\u2019s presidency, China has sought to portray itself as being reluctantly caught up in a conflict orchestrated by the White House. In the week when Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping used a speech to the WEF\u2019s annual meeting in Davos to warn that no one would be the winner in a trade war. However, some trade analysts believe that China\u2019s emollient attitude reflects the fact that it is rapidly running out of US goods to target, given the imbalance in trade between the two countries.",

RLAM, which manages \u00a3117bn of assets, said it will also vote against the senior independent director and the chairman of the audit committee, listing a string of complaints including the ability of board members to stand up to management, led by outspoken chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary. The investment manager joins The Local Authority Pension Fund Forum and shareholder advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS in recommending a vote against chairman David Bonderman at the AGM. \u201cWe are also concerned with Ryanair\u2019s corporate governance and poor stakeholder management, which could have an impact on the long term future of the company,\u201d said Ashley Hamilton Claxton, head of responsible investment at RLAM. \u201cWe have had long-standing issues with the independence of Ryanair\u2019s board and with the extent to which the board can provide effective challenge to management decisions. \u201cWhile we recognise that Ryanair has taken some steps towards improving the level of independence in its boardroom in the last year, this has not sufficiently mitigated our overall negative view of governance and oversight at the company.\u201d Ryanair said it was confident that shareholders would back the airline at the meeting, which will be held in Gormanstown, Ireland, on Thursday morning. A spokesperson said: \u201cRyanair shareholders will pass all AGM resolutions by a large majority this year, including the nomination of directors and chairman, as they have done in all previous years. They appreciate how fortunate we are to have an outstanding chairman like David Bonderman guide the board and the airline.\u201d RLAM, which has a 0.07% stake in the airline, said it was also concerned by Ryanair\u2019s plan to take away the voting rights of its non-EU shareholders under a hard Brexit scenario, as part of a quest to ensure it has an operating license within the bloc after the UK leaves. \u201cAs UK-based shareholders, we are vehemently against the proposal the company has put forward to take away our voting rights under a hard Brexit scenario,\u201d said Claxton. \u201cOne share, one vote is a fundamental pillar of good governance that companies should uphold.\u201d Ryanair has faced its worst ever strikes this summer, as action by pilots and cabin crew forced it to cancel flights, including to major holiday destinations such as Italy, Portugal and Spain. It secured a breakthrough in August after reaching a deal with striking Irish pilots, but cabin crew in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands are planning a one-day strike on 28 September. Unions have said there will be a strike once a month until demands are met. The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) said the relationship between Ryanair management and pilots has become \u201cutterly dysfunctional\u201d, risking the continued success of the company. Balpa is urging shareholders to replace O\u2019Leary and Bonderman. In the latest setback for the airline, a Spanish judge ruled on Wednesday that a former Ryanair pilot should have been considered an employee and not an independent contractor. Under Spanish law, a contractor does not enjoy the same workers\u2019 rights as an employee and the airline does not have to contribute to the worker\u2019s social security payments.",

    "webTitle": "Tesco opens discount store Jack's to take on Lidl and Aldi", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco has started a new front in its battle to win back shoppers from Aldi and Lidl with the launch of a new discount chain Jack\u2019s that promises to be the \u201ccheapest in town\u201d. The first two Jack\u2019s stores \u2013 named after the supermarket giant\u2019s founder Jack Cohen \u2013 will open on Thursday. Tesco\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis, said the chain would sell low-priced, predominantly British food and appeal to the \u201ceconomically challenged that need a bargain and the affluent shopper that wants a bargain\u201d. He added: \u201cWe will be the cheapest in town. There are full-range, full-service supermarkets, and clearly people want that, but there is a gap in terms of people wanting smaller, simpler, quicker shops and local produce.\u201d A typical large Tesco supermarket sells more than 25,000 products but Jack\u2019s will stock only 2,600 products \u2013 about the same as Aldi and Lidl. Nearly 70% of the products, from milk to eggs, bread and fresh meat are branded as Jack\u2019s but the stores will also sell 700 big-name branded lines including Coca-Cola, Bovril and Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire sauce. Lewis said Tesco had been working on the new Jack\u2019s brand for nearly three years and insisted the overt British branding, with union jacks prominently displayed on packaging, was not a response to Brexit. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with Brexit,\u201d Lewis insisted. \u201cIt is what customers are asking for.\u201d About 80% of the food on the shelves will be sourced from the UK. The first Jack\u2019s stores are in the small Cambridgeshire town of Chatteris and Immingham, Lincolnshire. They had been empty since 2014, when Tesco was rocked by an accounting scandal and had to cut costs. Lewis said the group planned to open 10-15 Jack\u2019s stores over the next six months. About half will be converted Tesco outlets, while others will be next to existing Tesco stores and some on new sites. The store\u2019s focus on British products is designed to differentiate it from Aldi and Lidl, which stock hundreds of lesser-known European brands. The decor emphasises Tesco\u2019s long heritage, with pictures of Cohen \u2013 who was nicknamed \u201cSlasher Jack\u201d for his \u201cpile it high, sell it cheap\u201d approach \u2013 adorning the walls. The layout and displays, with potatoes sold out of hessian sacks, is inspired by Cohen\u2019s market-stall roots. Jack\u2019s will check prices against local rivals but the new chain\u2019s claim to be the cheapest in town will be quickly tested by Aldi, which signalled it could launch a fresh round of price cuts in its Chatteris store, which is less than a two-minute drive away. \u201cOur customers will always pay the lowest grocery prices in the UK every time they shop with us,\u201d an Aldi spokesman said. The German retailers Aldi and Lidl have shaken up the UK grocery trade, nearly doubling their market share to 13.1% in the last five years. Their growth continues to far outpace that of traditional supermarkets. Tesco, which accounts for \u00a327.40 out of every \u00a3100 spent in UK supermarkets, compared with nearly \u00a332 at its peak, has hired the former Aldi executive Lawrence Harvey to run Jack\u2019s. Jack\u2019s stores follow the familiar basic layout of an Aldi or Lidl, with wide aisles and products stacked on pallets on the shop floor to save time and money. There is an aisle devoted to promotions on big-name grocery brands, such as Kellogg\u2019s Coco Pops and McVitie\u2019s Jaffa Cakes, which will change every few weeks. There is also an aisle of homewares on a \u201cwhen it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone\u201d basis, another familiar discounter tactic. This week\u2019s offers include a candy floss-scented unicorn pillow pet for \u00a38 and \u00a36 Playmobil sets. Tesco Clubcards will not be accepted in the new stores. Jack\u2019s stores, which will have polished concrete floors instead of tiles to keep costs low, will have fewer staff than a Tesco of the same size. Workers, who will wear their own clothes rather than a uniform, will earn more in basic pay per hour than Tesco staff \u2013 \u00a39 per hour compared with \u00a38.18 at present and \u00a38.42 from November at the main supermarket and \u00a38.85 at Aldi. However, Jack\u2019s workers will not get a staff discount or an annual bonus, unlike Tesco employees. Some analysts were disappointed by the limited scope of Tesco\u2019s plans for Jack\u2019s, given that it has nearly 2,700 UK stores. Jonathan De Mello, the head of retail consultancy at Harper Dennis Hobbs, described the plan as \u201cbringing a knife to a gunfight\u201d. He said: \u201cEither they push [Jack\u2019s] hard or don\u2019t do it at all.\u201d Tesco will hope Jack\u2019s, which coincides with the company\u2019s centenary next year, has more staying power than the discount chains tested by its mainstream rivals. Sainsbury\u2019s opened a string of Netto stores with the Danish chain\u2019s parent group in 2014, only to shut them two years later after struggling to make a profit. Asda\u2019s 2006 experiment with the Asda Essentials chain also closed swiftly. Increased competition has resulted in Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda, the UK\u2019s second- and third-largest supermarket chains, proposing a merger in an effort to cut costs, prompting an investigation by the competition watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority said on Wednesday it would examine whether shoppers could face higher prices or poorer quality of service in hundreds of areas where the stores overlap. It will also examine the potential impact on the fuel and clothing markets as well as on suppliers.",

Nearly 70% of the products, from milk to eggs, bread and fresh meat are branded as Jack\u2019s but the stores will also sell 700 big-name branded lines including Coca-Cola, Bovril and Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire sauce.</p> \n<p>Lewis said Tesco had been working on the new Jack\u2019s brand for nearly three years and insisted the overt British branding, with union jacks prominently displayed on packaging, was not a response to Brexit. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with Brexit,\u201d Lewis insisted. \u201cIt is what customers are asking for.\u201d About 80% of the food on the shelves will be sourced from the UK.</p> \n<p>The first Jack\u2019s stores are in the small Cambridgeshire town of Chatteris and Immingham, Lincolnshire. They had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/03/tesco-expansion-policy-hold-chatteris-ghost-store\">been empty since 2014</a>, when Tesco was rocked by an accounting scandal and had to cut costs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78de9e4a85ce10b883b639d54605d44a275e239a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78de9e4a85ce10b883b639d54605d44a275e239a/0_222_3107_1865/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cans of baked beans and sausages\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beans means bargains?

About half will be converted Tesco outlets, while others will be next to existing Tesco stores and some on new sites.</p> \n<p>The store\u2019s focus on British products is designed to differentiate it from Aldi and Lidl, which stock hundreds of lesser-known European brands. The decor emphasises Tesco\u2019s long heritage, with pictures of Cohen \u2013 who was nicknamed \u201cSlasher Jack\u201d for his \u201cpile it high, sell it cheap\u201d approach \u2013 adorning the walls.

Their growth continues to far outpace that of traditional supermarkets. Tesco, which accounts for \u00a327.40 out of every \u00a3100 spent in UK supermarkets, compared with nearly \u00a332 at its peak, has hired the former Aldi executive Lawrence Harvey to run Jack\u2019s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9354d4c2a9ed0f5d6ea257bbc79e48a4db4778c7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9354d4c2a9ed0f5d6ea257bbc79e48a4db4778c7/0_263_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Jack\u2019s bread at the new Jack\u2019s store\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sliced loaves at Jack\u2019s.

There is an aisle devoted to promotions on big-name grocery brands, such as Kellogg\u2019s Coco Pops and McVitie\u2019s Jaffa Cakes, which will change every few weeks. There is also an aisle of homewares on a \u201cwhen it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone\u201d basis, another familiar discounter tactic. This week\u2019s offers include a candy floss-scented unicorn pillow pet for \u00a38 and \u00a36 Playmobil sets.</p> \n<p>Tesco Clubcards will not be accepted in the new stores.</p> \n<p>Jack\u2019s stores, which will have polished concrete floors instead of tiles to keep costs low, will have fewer staff than a Tesco of the same size. Workers, who will wear their own clothes rather than a uniform, will earn more in basic pay per hour than Tesco staff \u2013 \u00a39 per hour compared with \u00a38.18 at present and \u00a38.42 from November at the main supermarket and \u00a38.85 at Aldi. However, Jack\u2019s workers will not get a staff discount or an annual bonus, unlike Tesco employees.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"668c3207-083d-4690-abfe-5811b82d355a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Tesco: 27.4<br></li>\n     <li>Sainsbury\u2019s: 15.4</li>\n     <li>Asda: 15.3</li>\n     <li>Morrisons: 10.2</li>\n     <li>Aldi: 7.6</li>\n     <li>Co-op: 6.6</li>\n     <li>Lidl: 5.5</li>\n     <li>Waitrose: 5.1</li>\n     <li>Iceland: 2.1</li>\n     <li>Ocado: 1.2</li>\n     <li>Others: 3.5<br><br><b>Market share (% in the 12 weeks to 9 September 2018)</b></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba3745b751243c58d1585a8c559c2bf1ebd74c12\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba3745b751243c58d1585a8c559c2bf1ebd74c12/0_35_3858_2314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"100% British milk at Jack\u2019s\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Discounted dairy: 100% British milk at Jack\u2019s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Russell/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Some analysts were disappointed by the limited scope of Tesco\u2019s plans for Jack\u2019s, given that it has nearly 2,700 UK stores.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chair of Royal Mail, Peter Long, has stepped down after one of the biggest executive pay revolts by investors in UK corporate history. The privatised postal service operator said Long had reviewed his board roles and decided to focus on his position as executive chair of the estate agent Countrywide. Royal Mail said Long had concluded it was no longer possible for him to remain as the executive chair of Countrywide and the non-executive chair of Royal Mail. Long, who has served as non-executive chair of Royal Mail for the past three years, has been replaced by Les Owen, a board member, with immediate effect. Owen is a former chief executive of the insurer Axa Sun Life. Royal Mail will hope the boardroom reshuffle will placate angry investors. In July nearly three-quarters of the investors refused to support the pay package given to the company\u2019s new chief executive, Rico Back. Back was awarded an annual deal worth up to \u00a32.7m if he reaches bonus targets, on top of a \u00a36m \u201cgolden hello\u201d for leaving the company\u2019s European subsidiary. Trade union bosses warned that postal workers would be furious at seeing such lavish awards only months after they agreed to cuts to their pensions to help the company save money. Long, who is also the deputy chair of the travel group Tui, has faced accusations of \u201cover-boarding\u201d. He stepped up to become the executive chair of Countrywide in January after the UK\u2019s largest estate agent issued its second profit warning in three months and Alison Platt resigned as chief executive. Countrywide, which operates under 50 or so brand names, including Hamptons International and Bairstow Eves, also faced a pay rebellion in August. It responded by scrapping a pay plan that could have handed its top executives, including Long, more than \u00a320m. Owen will receive an annual fee of \u00a3300,000, the same as his predecessor. Long will not get a payoff from Royal Mail. Owen\u2019s appointment may raise some eyebrows because he has been on the Royal Mail board since 2010. The UK corporate governance code states that where a director has served on a company board for more than nine years a clear explanation must be provided. Royal Mail said: \u201cLes\u2019s deep knowledge of our business means he is very well-placed to be our chairman \u2026 At present the board envisages Les remaining as chair for 12-18 months, which will give us plenty of time to refresh skills on the board and line up Les\u2019s successor.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap: British workers are facing a renewed wage squeeze after inflation jumped unexpectedly to a six-month high. The Consumer Prices Index rose by 2.7% year-on-year in August, up from 2.5% in July. The City had expected a drop to 2.4%. Higher clothing prices, transport bills and recreation costs all combined to push the cost of living up at a faster pace. It means inflation is now rising faster than total pay again, meaning the spectre of a cost of living squeeze still looms over the UK economy. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady has called on ministers to do more, including boosting pay for the poorest: \u201cThe pay squeeze is tightening again, but the government is doing nothing to get wages rising faster. \u201cThe minimum wage should be put up to \u00a310 an hour as quickly as possible. And we need a National Investment Bank to target communities that are most in need of new industry and better jobs. \u201cUnions are fighting hard to get workers better pay, but we need new rights to enter workplaces and negotiate with employers for fair pay rises.\u201d Economists called the news a \u2018body-blow\u2019 for families, warning that inflation could continue to spike if Brexit uncertainty weakens the pound. Thomas Wells, manager of the Smith &amp; Williamson Global Inflation-Linked Bond Fund, says: \u201cThis was a nasty inflation shock and, as we have said before, shows that a gentle glide back to the 2% target cannot be taken for granted. \u201cLooking at the components of RPI (up 3.5%), which is the underlying index for linkers, it appears that housing, leisure and travel costs have driven the stronger than expected inflation print. Indeed, the motorist continues to be clobbered by high petrol prices, which are up nearly 12% year-on-year. We would not read too much into the uptick in clothing and footwear, as this is a volatile component, and the trend here is not far from the four-month average. \u201cThe medium-term outlook for inflation remains unclear due to Brexit risks and potential supply disruptions. Moreover, \u2018shrinkflation\u2019 has been very much in evidence in Europe, for example, the size of fries in Belgium has contracted due to the very poor potato crop owing to the very dry weather over the summer. The UK will not be immune from similar pressures. In other news: China has appealed for free trade and multilateralism to be protected, after Donald Trump triggered another round of tariffs between the two economic powerhouses. Premier Xi also promised that China would not launch a currency war by weakening the yuan, saying: \u201cOne-way devaluation will do more harm than good to China\u2019s economy. China will by no means stimulate exports by devaluing the yuan.\u201d Stock markets are mostly higher, on optimism that the trade dispute can be resolved. Japan\u2019s Nikkei hit an eight-month high, while Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is up 42 points at 0.6%. The CEO of Danske Bank has resigned over a huge money-laundering scandal. UK supermarket chain Tesco has launched its new discount chain, Jack\u2019s, in an attempt to push back against budget groups Aldi and Lidl. Exactly ten years ago, Wall Street was suffering a dramatic plunge. Major bank share were slumping through the floor as the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse ripped through the markets. It\u2019s a gentler picture today. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 107 points in early trading, or 0.4%, to 26,354. Investors in New York are taking yesterday\u2019s tit-for-tat tariffs between the US and China in their stride, hoping that negotiations might deliver a breakthrough. But if you want to relive events a decade ago, here you are.... Far be it from me to point the finger when it comes to spelling mistakes, but this is quite impressive: In other news, the CEO of Denmark\u2019s Danske Bank quit today over a massive money-laundering scandal. Thomas Borgen quit as Danske reported that some \u20ac200bn in questionable money flowed through its Estonian branch, a jaw-dropping amount. Danske\u2019s small but highly profitable Estonian operation had 15,000 non-resident clients, including people based in the UK, Russia and the British Virgin Islands. Analysis of 6,200 of the riskiest customers showed that the \u201cvast majority have been found to be suspicious\u201d. Borgen said he was stepping down because Danske had \u201cfailed to live up to its responsibility\u201d Anti-corruption campaigner Bill Browder, a critic of the Russian government, says managers, regulators and the police all dropped the ball: NIESR, the economic think tank, report that inflationary pressures were strongest in London last month, and weakest in Yorkshire. It says: At the regional level, underlying inflation was highest in London at 1.4 per cent and lowest in Yorkshire and the Humber at 0.5 per cent in the year to August 2018 Ouch! The pound has just shed all its earlier gains and slumped into the red. Sterling has dropped back to $1.312, from the eight-week high of $1.32 after this morning\u2019s inflation shock. Why? Because Brexit negotiations have apparently hit another roadblock. According to The Times, the UK has decided to reject Europe\u2019s latest offer to fix the Irish Border puzzle. The Times says: Theresa May will today reject Michel Barnier\u2019s \u201cimproved\u201d offer to solve the Irish border issue, warning that it still violates Britain\u2019s red lines. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator said yesterday that the EU was preparing to table a new \u201cbackstop\u201d proposal that he hoped the government would be able to support. He said the new plan would not involve customs checks in the Irish Sea and would respect the \u201cterritorial integrity of the UK\u201d. But a senior government source said that Mr Barnier had still not dropped his insistence that Northern Ireland be treated as a separate customs jurisdiction from the rest of the United Kingdom..... Theresa May will meet with EU leaders in Salzburg later today for an informal summit, so we could hear more on Brexit soon. She\u2019s also ruled out another referendum (again)... Back on UK inflation...and Capital Economics reckon the cost of living squeeze might ease by next summer: That all depends on how Brexit plays out, I suggest, as a disorderly end to negotiations would surely weaken the pound and drive up import costs. In other retail news, shares in DIY chain Kingfisher have slumped by 4% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard after posting its latest financial results. Kingfisher, which runs B&amp;Q, reported an 18% slump in adjusted pre-tax profits in the six months to 31 July. CEO V\u00e9ronique Laury, Chief Executive Officer, blamed difficulties in France for holding back her transformation plan: \u201cTransformation on this scale is tough, and there are challenges that we\u2019re working through. There is still much to do to improve our performance in France and to remove inefficiencies within the business as we continue to transform at pace. I am confident that we have the right plan and the opportunity for Kingfisher is significant. Kingfisher\u2019s French profits plunged by almost 30%, taking the shine off a 1.3% rise in UK profits. Callum Stayton, retail sector specialist at management consultancy Vendigital, reckons Tesco could make a success of its new discount arm: \u201cThe timing is right for Jack\u2019s as market share at the discount end of the market is still growing at a rate of 10 percent per year, so there is still a lot to play for. Set up costs will also be quite low as Tesco plans to scoop up sites that have been vacant for a long time or redevelop some of its less-successful Metro stores. \u201cFollowing its takeover of Booker, Tesco has first-hand experience of sourcing and supplying large volumes of goods and this will stand it in good stead when rolling out Jack\u2019s, which is expected to stock higher volumes of fewer goods than its mainstream stores.\u201d With inflation rearing up, more UK consumers might be interested in Tesco\u2019s new discount supermarket chain. Tesco has been unveiling \u201cJack\u2019s\u201d to a group of journalists in Chatteris this morning. It\u2019s aimed firmly at German discounters Aldi and Lidl, with fewer items than a traditional Tesco\u2019s and a firm focus on British products. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: The first store has been unveiled by the Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, in the small Cambridgeshire town of Chatteris. The public will get their first chance to shop at Jack\u2019s on Thursday morning when the store opens, along with a second outlet in Immingham, Lincolnshire. The new chain is named after Jack Cohen, who founded Tesco 99 years ago, earning the nickname \u201cSlasher Jack\u201d for his \u201cpile-it-high, sell-it-cheap\u201d approach to retailing. Lewis said the group planned to open 10 to 15 Jack\u2019s stores over the next six months, about half of which will be converted Tesco outlets while others will be next to existing Tesco stores and some on new sites. Some price are certainly cheap; bread, for example, is on the shelf at 45p per loaf. Chicken is on offer at \u00a31.60 / kg (corrected), compared to \u00a32.75 / kg for a Waitrose Essential bird. Other prices look less sensational, as Tesco\u2019s beancounters try to pitch their new offering correctly: Jack\u2019s also makes it easier to hand over your hard-earned cash, with a mobile app as an alternative to its traditional checkouts and self-service tills. Here\u2019s our full story: Three factors drove UK inflation higher last month. In Transport, the cost of travelling by air or sea rose in August. Petrol prices rose by 1.4p per litre, while diesel rose by 1.2p per litre. Clothing and footwear also become more expensive, with prices rising by 3.1% between July and August. Women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing rose particularly sharply, the ONS says. Recreation and culture costs rose by 0.6% between July and August. The ONS blamed \u201cpricier theatre tickets\u201d (although it\u2019s hard to believe this had a huge impact on the nation\u2019s wallets) and another rise in computer game prices. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), also fears that a no-deal Brexit could shove inflation higher. \u201cInflation surprisingly rose for the second successive month in August, largely wiping out the recent recovery in real wage growth and emphasising the continued squeeze on consumers. \u201cThe strong growth in producer prices indicates that inflationary pressures further down the supply chain remain significant and could lift inflation higher in the coming months. However, the upward pressure on prices remains transitory, and inflation should resume its ease back towards target once the impact of the recent increase in oil prices drops out of the calculation. \u201cThe possibility of a disorderly Brexit is the key risk to the UK\u2019s outlook for inflation as it could result in a substantial decline in sterling, which could significantly increase inflation and exacerbate the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses. More bad news for households: inflation could keep rising in the months ahead, especially if Brexit talks flounder (weakening the pound). If so, that could mean inflation keeps rising faster than total pay. Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, explains: \u201cToday\u2019s inflation figures are a body blow to UK households after the latest CPI figures showed that price rises jumped 2.7% in August, driven largely by increased costs for recreational and cultural goods and services, transport services and clothing. The latest figures mean that wage growth including bonuses (2.6%) has once again fallen behind inflation and means that we are all getting progressively poorer again. \u201cTo rub salt in the wounds there\u2019s also a distinct possibility that inflation could continue to climb as the oil price has recently crept up to over $80 a barrel, meaning we are likely to see prices at the petrol pumps start ticking up. \u201cAnd on top of this there\u2019s the ongoing uncertainty around the Brexit negotiations which could put an end to sterling\u2019s recent good run. If recent sterling strength is reversed then the cost of imported goods will start going up again and UK businesses reliant on these goods will need to start hiking prices in order to protect their margins. City economist Simon French of Panmure Gordon says the slump in the pound in August (it hit a 14-month low) drove inflation up: Economist Ulrik Bie says rising inflation is pushing more UK people into debt, because wages aren\u2019t rising fast enough. The jump in UK inflation to 2.7% is bad news for households. Average basic pay is only rising by 2.9% per year at present, meaning pay rises are only just keeping ahead of the cost of living. Total pay, including bonuses, is rising by 2.6% - meaning no real wage growth at all. That\u2019s particularly disappointing as unemployment is at a 43-year low, which ought to give workers the upper hand in wage negotiations. The Office for National Statistics, Head of Inflation Mike Hardie, says: \u201cConsumers paid more for theatre shows, sea fares and new season autumn clothing last month. However, mobile phone charges, and furniture and household goods had a downward effect on inflation. \u201cUK house prices continued to grow but at their lowest annual rate for five years, driven again by a fall in London. The housing market saw strong growth in the North West, South West and West Midlands.\u201d Although prices are rising faster in the shops, UK house price inflation has fallen. Average house prices in the UK rose by 3.1% in the year to July 2018, the Office for National Statistics reports, down from 3.2% in June. This is the lowest UK annual rate since August 2013 when it was 3.0%. And in London, prices have now shrank by 0.7% over the last year. At 2.7%, UK inflation is now at its highest level in six months. Rising transport, clothing and recreational goods prices drove the cost of living higher in August, the Office for National Statistics reports. Food and alcohol prices also drove inflation up: Sterling has jumped to an eight-week high against the US dollar. It\u2019s trading over $1.32 for the first time since late-July. Traders are calculating that higher inflation makes an early interest rate rise more likely. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s inflation rate has jumped to 2.7% in August, putting a squeeze on households again. That\u2019s up from 2.5% in July, and dashes expectations that the consumer prices index would drop to 2.4%. More to follow.... Over in Tallinn, Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane is giving a speech to mark the 100th Anniversary of the Bank of Estonia. Rather than bringing a telegram from the Queen, Haldane has turned up with a speech on central bank communication through the ages (\u2018oooh, it\u2019s just what I always wanted\u2019). In it, he points out that central bankers were notoriously secretive once: It was only a generation ago that, when asked by Mervyn King for a one-word piece of advice, Paul Volcker replied \u201cmystique\u201d. To that point, opacity rather than transparency coursed through central bankers\u2019 veins. That bloodline ran from Montagu Norman a century ago (\u201cnever explain, never apologise\u201d) through to Alan Greenspan a generation ago (\u201cI\u2019ve learned to mumble with great incoherence\u201d). Today, though, we have forward guidance on interest rates and regular press conferences to help get the message out. Education is another key part of the BoE\u2019s strategy, Haldane says. Through its econoME project, it provides classroom materials on the economy and financial system for use in schools. Secondary schools at present, but Haldane has ambitious plans to spread the word: As the name suggests, and like our recent public communications efforts, these materials describe the economy and finance in terms which are personal and relatable to young people\u2019s lives. Why does the economy and finance matter to me? And how do my decisions in turn affect the economy? We set ourselves a target of reaching 400 state schools with econoME during the course of this year. So far since launch in April, over 1,000 schools have downloaded the materials, conceivably covering around 90,000 pupils. 52 This demonstrates the potential pent-up demand for school materials on economic and financial issues. The Bank\u2019s aim is to reach close to 1,500 schools by mid-2020. We are currently considering where next to take our education initiatives. A promising avenue would be a younger age range, say 7-11 year olds. This will require different materials and possibly a different approach. A more challenging market still would be adults, perhaps linked to existing initiatives to boost economic and financial literacy in the public at large. China is often accused of discriminating against foreign companies on its turf, in favour of local (sometime state-controlled) firms instead. Chinese premier Li Keqiang, though, is promising to give foreign investors equal treatment. The FT\u2019s Lucy Hornby has the details: \u201cChinese and foreign companies can compete on a level playing field in this big market. That gives better vitality to the Chinese economy,\u201d Mr Li said at the World Economic Forum, triggering prolonged applause from an audience that included high-tech manufacturers from overseas and small businesses from provincial cities. China, he said, would cut taxes and unlock financing for the country\u2019s private businesses. \u201cThe pool is full of water, the challenge is to unblock the channels,\u201d he said, adding that Beijing would not devalue the renminbi but keep its currency \u201cat an adaptive and equilibrium level\u201d. European stock markets have hit a two-week high in early trading. In London, the FTSE 100 is 17 points higher at 7317 (+0.25%). Mining stocks are leading the way, as traders express optimism that China and the US might cool their trade dispute. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Though China announcing tariffs on $60 billion in US imports isn\u2019t great news, it is not as bad as it could have been. The response was also tempered by the country\u2019s deputy leader Li Keqiang urging that the \u2018basic principles\u2019 of free trade are held up, while promising that China won\u2019t weaponise its currency (something it has already been accused of doing by Trump). Premier Li\u2019s call for a multilateral solution to the trade dispute is going down well in the markets. In Tokyo, the Nikkei index has hit its highest level in eight months. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite jumped by 1%, amid relief that Beijing\u2019s latest tariffs on the US are lower than feared. Investors are heartened by Li\u2019s pledge not to launch a currency war, as Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: The Chinese yuan has been under the hammer due to two reasons; sluggish domestic growth and impending trade war. China has been blamed by the U.S. for devaluing its currency to gain a competitive edge. Over in Asia, we have seen that traders have felt more comfortable about China\u2019s recent comments on currency devaluation and this has bolstered the Asian equity market. Importantly, premier Li has also pledged that China won\u2019t weaponise its currency in its tussle with Donald Trump. In his keynote speech in Tianjin, Li promise that Beijing hadn\u2019t been deliberately weakening the yuan - and wouldn\u2019t do so, either. He said: \u201cRecent fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate have been seen as an intentional measure, but that isn\u2019t true,. \u201cOne-way devaluation will do more harm than good to China\u2019s economy. China will by no means stimulate exports by devaluing the yuan.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The threat of a global trade war looms over the financial world today, after the US and China hit each other with sweeping tariffs. Beijing hit back at Washington yesterday, with new levies on $60bn of US goods, just hours after Donald Trump signed off tariffs on $200bn of Chinese products. This latest tit-for-tat action dragged the world economy a little closer to full-blown protectionism. But...there is also optimism, as China\u2019s retaliation is less severe than it had laid out last month. And over in Beijing today, China\u2019s deputy leader has called for more support for free trade. Premier Li Keqiang told a World Economic Forum conference, in the eastern city of Tianjin, that such disputes must be resolved through consultation. It is essential that we uphold the basic principles of multilateralism and free trade.... No unilateralism will offer a viable solution.\u201d Li also warned that the world economy now stands at \u201ca crossroads facing a choice between globalization or deglobalization.\u201d China, he pledged, will do its bit by opening up \u201cat a faster pace\u201d. That will have gone down well with WEF at its \u201cSummer Davos\u201d in Tianjin. More cynical voices might point out that China does operate plenty of roadblocks to free trade today - second behind Russia, according to one EU report this year. But still, Li\u2019s words may reassure investors that the two economic powers will reach an agreement on trade policies, rather than descend deeper into a swamp of tariffs, trade barriers and bad-mouthing. Also coming up today UK inflation data is out this morning. Economists predict that price rose by 2.4% year-on-year in August, down from July\u2019s 2.5%. That would give workers a small but much-needed real wage boost. Supermarket chain Tesco is launching its new discount store format, Jack\u2019s, to compete with the success of Lidl and Aldi. It could be a game-changer, if Tesco can get it right... Plus, traders will be watching for speeches from two central bankers; European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, and the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane.

Why does the economy and finance matter to me? And how do my decisions in turn affect the economy?</p> <p>We set ourselves a target of reaching 400 state schools with econoME during the course of this year. So far since launch in April, over 1,000 schools have downloaded the materials, conceivably covering around 90,000 pupils. 52 This demonstrates the potential pent-up demand for school materials on economic and financial issues.</p> <p>The Bank\u2019s aim is to reach close to 1,500 schools by mid-2020. We are currently considering where next to take our education initiatives. A promising avenue would be a younger age range, say 7-11 year olds. This will require different materials and possibly a different approach.

      "bodyText": "The war in Syria and a population surge in sub-Saharan Africa have undermined efforts to reduce the number of people living in extreme poverty, the World Bank has said. In its annual report, the Washington-based development agency said the proportion of people living in such conditions had fallen to a new low of 10% in 2015 \u2013 the latest number available \u2013 down from 11% in 2013. It meant that the number of people living on less than $1.90 a day fell by 68 million to 736 million. But the decline was half the rate of previous years and had slowed further, according to preliminary figures that estimated a 1.4 percentage-point fall between 2015 and 2018. The agency, which aims to support sustainable development, added to the gloomy picture this year, with figures showing that those lifted out of extreme poverty struggled to make further progress up the income ladder. The World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, said the latest poverty audit represented \u201cslow progress\u201d towards a goal that would leave just 3% of people living in extreme poverty by 2030. \u201cOver the last 25 years, more than a billion people have lifted themselves out of extreme poverty, and the global poverty rate is now lower than it has ever been in recorded history. This is one of the greatest human achievements of our time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we are going to end poverty by 2030, we need much more investment, particularly in building human capital, to help promote the inclusive growth it will take to reach the remaining poor. For their sake, we cannot fail.\u201d Much of the reduction in global poverty over recent decades has been in China and neighbouring countries that have benefited from its spectacular growth rate. The global average has also benefited from the efforts of South American countries such as Brazil and Chile to lift people out of poverty. Poverty rates have improved in some east African countries, but much of sub-Saharan Africa has fallen back after a population rise, especially in Nigeria and other west African states. The first chapter of the report, Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2018: Piecing Together the Poverty Puzzle, which has been released in the run-up to the World Bank\u2019s annual meeting next month in Bali, found that in the Middle East and north Africa, conflict in Syria and Yemen raised the level of extreme poverty from 9.5 million in 2013 to 18.6 million in 2015. In sub-Saharan Africa, the number grew from 405 million people in 2013 to 413 million in 2015. Kim said alongside population growth, higher-than-expected poverty rates also reflected falling commodity prices, growing trade tensions, internal conflicts and political instability. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to be the driving force behind the global population reaching 9.7 billion by 2050, from the current level of about 7.5 billion. By 2050, the UN expects about two-thirds of the global population to live in cities and more than half them to suffer shortages of basic commodities such as water. The World Bank has come under fire in the past from unions and anti-poverty agencies for backing mainstream economic policies that recommend weakening workers\u2019 rights and cutting business taxes to drive economic growth. World Bank officials have countered that they are working with most countries in the sub-Saharan region with tailor-made policies to promote growth and alleviate poverty without having a one-size-fits-all agenda.",

These days they are 13% of the market in combination and harder to knock off their stride with an imitation format. A rough copy of Aldi seems a fair description of Jack\u2019s at first glance. The breadth of the product range is similar \u2013 2,600 lines versus 25,000-plus in a big supermarket. Like Aldi in the UK, Jack\u2019s will be shouting about how much of the food is sourced in this country. And the \u201cwhen it\u2019s gone it\u2019s gone\u201d aisle of non-food merchandise looks a straight lift. The first Jack\u2019s in Chatteris in Cambridgeshire looks tidy and airy in the photos \u2013 but so do new Aldis and Lidls. Never underestimate Tesco, of course. It\u2019s got huge buying clout and will have learned from Sainsbury\u2019s failed attempt to take the fight to the discounters in its partnership with the Danish chain Netto. It is better placed than anyone else to have a go. The timing still looks odd, though. When Aldi and Lidl launched in the UK (1990 and 1994 respectively), the big supermarket chains smelled danger, launched \u201cvalue\u201d lines and, by the turn of the century, thought they had seen off the threat. In Tesco\u2019s boardroom they dreamed of global conquests, which led to the hideously expensive flop in the US called Fresh &amp; Easy. It was paid for by keeping profit margins high on the home front \u2013 milking UK customers, in other words. That, in turn, created a new opportunity for Aldi and Lidl, who capitalised on the post-2008 crash in commercial property prices to open hundreds of new stores. Both chains have more than 700 stores in the UK, a position that looks entrenched. Even at that scale, however, their profit margins in the UK are thin. That\u2019s the real challenge for Tesco \u2013 how to make money from Jack\u2019s. The Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, thinks it can be done but he\u2019s not betting the farm on the idea, which will be a relief to his shareholders. The initial plan involves only 10-15 stores and the capital expenditure budget will be \u00a320m to \u00a330m \u2013 peanuts in the context of a group the size of Tesco. It\u2019s an experiment. It\u2019s worth a shot, given the shift in shopping habits, especially if, like Tesco, you\u2019ve got some redundant stores on the books. But the management at Aldi and Lidl will not be quaking in fear. Something had to give for Royal Mail chairman Peter Long says he resigned as the chairman of Royal Mail with \u201ca heavy heart\u201d. The 34% shareholder vote against his re-election in July may also have had something to do with it. The rebels accused Long of \u201cover-boarding\u201d, the useful (if ugly) term to describe the practice of sitting on too many boards. Their worry was legitimate. Since January, Long has been leading the rescue of the ailing estate agency Countrywide as executive chairman, a job that looks a full-time gig for anyone. It would be tricky to combine with the \u00a3300,000-a-year chairmanship of Royal Mail, a FTSE 100 company in the political and regulatory spotlight. Back in July, Long sounded aggrieved that Royal Mail investors may have missed the fact he had quit yet another role, the chairmanship of a Spanish theme park firm. Now he has conceded, in effect, that the rebellious shareholders had a point. Maybe the workload at Countrywide became heavier after a fund-raising last month to back a three-year turnaround plan. Or perhaps he feared next year\u2019s vote by Royal Mail shareholders might be another embarrassment. Either way, he has reached the right decision. Something had to give. Les Owen is the new chairman but will stay for only 12-18 months because he\u2019s already been on Royal Mail\u2019s board for eight years. So there\u2019s an interesting medium-term vacancy, especially if a pro-renationalisation Labour administration were still to be an electoral possibility. A good hire for Royal Mail might be a well-connected leftward-leaning business figure who backs the privatised model. That will test the headhunters. Danske Bank scandal a tale of inadequate checks The scale of the Danske Bank money-laundering scandal is extraordinary. Some \u20ac200bn of questionable money flowed through Estonian branch of Denmark\u2019s biggest bank. And it happened over eight years, from 2007 to 2015. The resignation of the chief executive Thomas Borgen, a former head of Danske\u2019s international operations during the relevant period, is only the start of the fallout. US officials will inevitably be handing down multibillion penalties for the dollar transactions. And EU banking regulators look seriously exposed as a tale emerges of inadequate checks on the improbably huge returns Danske was making in its small Estonian offshoot. The system looks full of holes \u2013 just as critics have been saying for years.",

      "bodyText": "Orla Kiely, the brand known for its 1970s-inspired prints and favoured by the Duchess of Cambridge and Alexa Chung, has closed its stores and website in the UK and Ireland after its parent company, Kiely Rowan, appointed administrators to wind down the company. The company, named after the Irish designer who owns it \u2013 known as the \u201cqueen of prints\u201d \u2013 and her husband, Dermott Rowan, said it was entering voluntary liquidation \u201cfollowing various challenges that have faced the company over the past few years, both in the UK and abroad\u201d. Insolvency practitioners David Rubin &amp; Partners have been appointed to handle the winding down of the handbag and fashion business, which includes stores on King\u2019s Road and Seven Dials in London and one in Kildare, Ireland. A spokesman said the insolvency process, under which all assets of the business are sold to pay off creditors, had just commenced and the company would not be placed into liquidation until the beginning of October. It is understood that about 40 of the group\u2019s 50-plus staff, half of whom work in the stores and the rest at the brand\u2019s head office in Fitzrovia in London, have been made redundant. A spokesman added: \u201cOrla Kiely\u2019s home and design licensing business will not be affected, and its selection of accessories and homewares will continue to be sold through its distribution partners.\u201d In the year to March 2017, Kiely Rowan made sales of \u00a38.3m, up 15% on a year before, as the brand expanded in the US and far east but pre-tax profits fell by about a third to \u00a3101,000 as interest payments on its debts jumped to \u00a3221,597 from just under \u00a382,000 a year before. The group\u2019s bank overdraft more than tripled to \u00a31.9m. Julie Palmer, a partner at the advisory firm Begbies Traynor, said: \u201cOrla Kiely had the backing of high-profile celebrities and clearly had appeal to the latest generation of shoppers. If this latest news shows anything, it\u2019s that there is no magic formula to success. Celebrity endorsements and being on trend don\u2019t always guarantee results. \u201cBusinesses must remain vigilant, adapt and innovate with a core strength if they are to rise out this distressing time for retail.\u201d The problems at Orla Kiely come amid widespread difficulties on the high street that have pushed well-known retailers including House of Fraser and Toys R Us into administration. A whole string of retailers, including New Look and Mothercare, have embarked on mass store closures as they cope with the switch to online shopping and a slowdown in consumer spending. Kiely, who set up her own label 23 years ago after cutting her teeth as a wallpaper and fabric designer, was this year celebrated in A Life in Pattern, an exhibition at the Fashion and Textile Museum in London. Her breakthrough came in the mid-1990s with her signature laminated bags that featured a simplified plant print in bright and bold colours. In recent years the brand has become ubiquitous as its simple colourful graphics have played into the trend for mid-century furnishings. The label\u2019s designs, once the preserve of well-heeled arty types, have appeared on bicycles, bedding, Tesco bags for life, budget fashion at the Uniqlo chain and on yoghurts. The homeware business, which accounts for about half the brand\u2019s sales, will not be affected by the liquidation of Kiely Rowan.",

      "bodyText": "UK inflation unexpectedly rose to the highest level in six months in August, pushed up by the rising cost of items including theatre tickets, package holidays, and high street shops launching their new-season autumn clothing ranges. The Office for National Statistics said the consumer price index (CPI) jumped to 2.7% last month from 2.5% in July, confounding economists\u2019 forecasts for the rate to fall to 2.4%. The surprise increase will prove unwelcome for hard-pressed British households, which had finally begun to see wages rising above inflation earlier this year, following a protracted squeeze on living standards triggered by the Brexit vote. Although workers\u2019 annual pay rises have gradually begun increasing, they remain perilously close to inflation. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cThe pay squeeze is tightening again but the government is doing nothing to get wages rising faster.\u201d The latest labour market figures, which lag inflation data by a month, showed total pay including bonuses rose by 2.9% in the three months to July. Regular pay growth was 2.6%, suggesting real wages could be falling for many workers in Britain. Mike Jakeman, a senior economist at PwC, said: \u201cA faster rate of inflation is likely to reduce the narrow gap between wages and inflation further, meaning that the rise in living standards for workers is likely to have been only marginal.\u201d The ONS said the biggest contribution to the increased cost of living came from the fastest annual rise for the cost of recreation and culture since January 2010, fuelled by the rising price of package holidays, theatre tickets, toys and computer games. Clothing launched by high street shops for the autumn season also had an impact, with the average price of clothing and footwear increasing by 3.1%, with women\u2019s and children\u2019s items increasing most. Although petrol prices continued to climb, rising by 1.4% between July and August, the rise was lower than a 1.8% increase experienced over the same period a year ago, providing a small downward contribution to the inflation rate. Some economist said the latest uptick for inflation could be temporary \u2013 particularly as the uptick was driven by large increases from relatively few items. Inflation has also been gradually falling this year as the impact from the post-EU referendum drop in sterling begins to fade. The Bank of England has, however, expressed concern that inflation remains above the 2% target set by the government, fuelling its decision to raise interest rates last month above the emergency level introduced after the financial crisis for the first time. Annual house price growth across the country slowed to the slowest rate for almost five years in July, hitting 3.1% from a rate of 3.2% a month earlier, fuelled by falling prices in the London property market. The average price of a home in the capital fell by 0.7% over the course of the year to July, extending a decline of 0.3% in the year to June. Despite falling valuations in London, house prices remain more than double the UK average of \u00a3231,000 in July. The north-east of England remained the region with the lowest average house prices, at \u00a3132,000. Dan Tomlinson, a policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said the slowing growth in house prices should not automatically point towards easing cost of living pressures across the UK. \u201cThis slowdown is driven almost entirely by trends in London and the south-east. House price rises are still outpacing wage growth across many other parts of the country,\u201d he said. The north-west showed the highest annual growth rate in the ONS figures, with prices rising by 5.6% in the year to July. Prices in the south-west and West Midlands also rose above the rate of inflation and workers\u2019 pay growth at 4.4%.",

      "bodyText": "The average cost of a car from an EU country could rise by \u00a31,500 in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK\u2019s automotive trade body has predicted. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned that leaving without a deal was \u201cnot an option\u201d for the automotive sector, which supports more than 800,000 jobs in the UK. It said time was running out to avert tariffs that would force up the price of cars both in the EU and UK, costing consumers more, as well as damaging jobs and reducing profitability. The trade body will tell EU representatives at a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday that Britain crashing out of the union would add \u00a35bn in annual tariffs to the price of the 2.7m cars and vans that cross the Channel each year. For EU buyers, the average price of a UK-built car would rise by \u00a32,700, it said, with light commercial vehicles rising by \u00a32,000. It said these increases, based on World Trade Organisation tariffs of 10%, would damage the UK automotive sector, which turns over \u00a382bn a year. At the same time, UK buyers of EU vehicles would have to pay \u00a31,500 more for a car and \u00a31,700 more for a van, if manufactures and their dealers did not absorb the extra cost of trade. British buyers registered nearly 2m cars and vans from the continent in 2017, according to SMMT data. Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cTariffs alone should be enough to focus minds on sealing a withdrawal agreement between the EU and UK but the potential impact of \u2018no-deal\u2019 means the stakes for the automotive sector are far higher. Without a deal, there can be no transition period and the complex issues surrounding tariffs and trade, customs, regulation and access to talent, will remain unresolved. \u201cOur industry is deeply integrated across both sides of the Channel so we look to negotiators to recognise the needs of the whole European automotive industry and act swiftly to avoid disruption and damage to one of our most valuable shared economic assets.\u201d The trade body said it was calling on Brexit negotiators on both sides of the Channel to prioritise a managed withdrawal for the UK that maintained a \u201cstatus quo\u201d transition for car makers. The SMMT has been a frequent and vocal critic of a no-deal Brexit, warning that the industry, which directly employs 186,000 people in the UK, is not ready for such an exit. Its latest intervention comes hard on the heels of a string of warnings by car makers operating in the UK, including BMW, Honda and Jaguar Land Rover. Honda said a no-deal Brexit would cost it tens of millions of pounds a year, while BMW revealed plans to shut down its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after the official exit date on 29 March in 2019. Earlier in the week Jaguar Land Rover announced that about 2,000 staff would move to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant in the West Midlands. It revealed the decision only hours after its chief executive, Ralf Speth, was accused of \u201cscaremongering\u201d about the impact of leaving the EU by the Brexit-supporting Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin.",

      "bodyText": "Only one in every five of the UK\u2019s super-rich have even a tiny fraction of their assets held in sustainable investments, according to research which reveals that wealthy Britons are lagging behind Chinese and Brazilian millionaires in investing their money ethically. Research by UBS Global Wealth Management found that just 20% of British high net worth individuals (HNWIs) \u2013 classed as those with more than $1m (\u00a3760,000) in investable assets \u2013 hold at least 1% of their fortunes in sustainable investments. This compared with an average of 39% of HNWIs across the world. The UBS Investor Watch research found that 60% of Chinese HNWIs had at least 1% of their assets held in sustainable funds, followed by Brazilians and people from the United Arab Emirates. Among 5,300 HNIs surveyed, Britons were the second-least likely to invest in sustainable investments after Americans. Just 12% of wealthy people in the US had more than 1% of their fortunes held in sustainable investments \u2013 a broad term which includes renewable energy and companies which have committed to pay employees fairly. Nick Tucker, head of the UK for UBS Global Wealth Management, said: \u201cIt is disappointing to see the UK lagging behind other markets in the pursuit of sustainable investments. However, the growing momentum among UK investors considering this investment route is undeniable. We are increasingly having conversations with clients, across generations, about how they can best build sustainable investing into their portfolios. \u201cWe\u2019re now at a pivotal moment where increasing investor interest in sustainable investing and an increasing number of available and suitable products are coming together. We expect the UK market to play catch up as this plays out.\u201d The research found that 65% of the global super-rich viewed \u201ccreating a better planet as extremely important\u201d and said they pay more for products and services that are more environmentally friendly. \u201cHowever, not nearly as many investors apply their values to their investing. Currently, only 39% hold sustainable investments in their portfolios,\u201d the report said. UBS said younger rich people are much more likely to pump their money into sustainable investments than their parents. In the UK, HNWIs under 35 allocate four-times as much of their fortunes to sustainable investments as the over 65s. Of the wealthy people who had committed a proportion of their funds to sustainable investments, 23% said they had been heavily influenced in the decision by their children.",

At the very least, the Alibaba billionaire\u2019s opening analysis is surely correct: \u201cIf you want a short-term solution, there is no solution.\u201d First, an immediate climbdown by either side is out of the question. Donald Trump\u2019s imposition of 10% tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports was quickly followed by China\u2019s retaliation \u2013 duties of up to 10% on $60bn worth of US goods travelling in the other direction. Beijing\u2019s response was weaker than some had expected but could not be described as a step backwards. China seems to be saying that it has been drawn reluctantly into this tit-for-tat exchange but is prepared to keep going if necessary. Second, the Trump administration structured its tariffs to suggest it is settling in for a long battle \u2013 10% now, which is too late to increase prices in shops during Thanksgiving, with a threat to go to 25% in 2019. This staggered process seems designed to ease the hit to low-income US consumers, which is tactically sensible from the president\u2019s point of view. A backlash from swing voters is probably the reaction he fears most. Third, there is no strategic reason for China to back down at this stage. Tariffs will threaten Chinese jobs but Beijing can always try to boost domestic demand to offset the likely fall in exports to the US. Within limits, it can also let the yuan slide against the US dollar to regain competitive clout. In short, it can wait to see what happens. An authoritarian one-party regime doesn\u2019t have to worry about the electoral cycle. Fourth, the pure rhetoric does not suggest compromise. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross declared that China is \u201cout of bullets\u201d, as if taunting Beijing. On the Chinese side, they probably wonder whether Washington is even interested in a negotiated settlement, which was a fair line of speculation even before Tuesday\u2019s escalation. As Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroders, puts it: \u201cThe red lines on each side are too ideological and entrenched to allow much room for manoeuvre.\u201d China sees its trade policies as essential to its next stage of economic growth; Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach blames China for hollowing out large parts of the US economy. So settle back and expect more of the same. Financial markets haven\u2019t been panicked so far, either because the short-term damage to global trade looks modest, or because it is still possible to cling to the idea that Trump won\u2019t follow through on his threat to raise tariffs to 25% in the new year. But it seems more likely that Trump discovers that a trade war with China cannot be \u201cwon\u201d quickly and opts for more extreme measures. He needs something to show his supporters, which he doesn\u2019t seem close to getting yet. A bigger trade war, with other countries drawn in, is suddenly a real risk. Bitcoin is a sideshow for regulators The Treasury select committee has got one thing right: \u201ccryptocurrencies\u201d like bitcoin aren\u2019t really currencies because they don\u2019t do most of the things expected of a currency. They don\u2019t store value since the price can halve suddenly. They\u2019re not a true medium of exchange since most shops won\u2019t accept them. And they\u2019re not a practical unit of account because the processing of transactions is so energy-intensive. The committee prefers the term \u201ccrypto-assets\u201d, which is technically better \u2013 just don\u2019t expect it to catch on. The real point of the report, however, is to ponder the troubled question of how much regulation is required. Much more, conclude the MPs, before adding the hopeful thought that \u201cproportionate regulation could see UK as well placed to become global centre for crypto-assets\u201d. The first half of the prescription is easy to agree with. Some of the marketing of crypto-asset coin offerings is plainly misleading and it would be a good thing if the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed proper standards, as opposed to issuing general warnings that punters could lose everything. The same applies to the danger of money-laundering. If the regulator needs more powers to investigate, grant them. It is harder, though, to believe that the FCA should waste much time trying to make the UK a global centre for crypto-assets. Bitcoin and its imitators are a minority sport and very likely to remain that way. The UK doesn\u2019t need to get into a global race to attract more of them. By all means, come down hard on the dodgy financial marketing. But the FCA has a mainstream financial industry to regulate \u2013 and that\u2019s where its attention should remain.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s economic growth could suffer a serious setback as the country\u2019s exporters risk being caught up in the mounting trade war between the United States and China. As Beijing retaliated with tariffs on $60bn of US goods following the Trump administration\u2019s $200bn hit on Chinese imports, a closely watched index on Australia\u2019s economic prospects pointed to a slowing in momentum for the remainder of the year and into 2019. But despite widespread concerns about a negative impact on the global economy, stock markets appeared to shrug off news of the new tariffs on Wednesday helped by a positive finish on Wall Street on Tuesday night. The Nikkei index in Tokyo jumped 1.3%, the ASX 200 rose 0.4% in Sydney and the Shanghai composite was up 0.3%. The optimistic mood suggests that investors believed the US tariffs of 10% rising to 25% in January could have been worse and that the impact of the trade war was already priced into share values. The Australian dollar, which is seen as barometer of world trade, jumped 0.6% to US72.26c, while the Chinese yuan also reversed recent losses. \u201cThe markets are able to regroup now that the latest phase of the US-China trade war is over,\u201d said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. \u201cThere was relief as the United States set the initial tariffs at 10%, rather than the expected 25%, seen by some as a gesture that it was buying time for further negotiations.\u201d Concerns remain, however, that Australia could suffer as a result of the new tariffs. The Westpac\u2013Melbourne Institute leading index, which indicates the likely pace of economic activity relative to trend three to nine months into the future, fell from 0.5% in July to -0.02% in August. The index had shown an average growth rate of 0.89% in the seven months from October last year to April this year. But in the four months since April, the growth rate has averaged only 0.1%, indicating \u201ca clear step down\u201d, according to Westpac\u2019s chief economist, Bill Evans. He blamed headwinds from weak wages growth, falling property prices in Sydney and Melbourne, and a slowdown in jobs growth as both political uncertainty and global volatility weigh on employment decisions. UBS economists forecast in a note to clients on Wednesday that the US tariffs would act as a drag on the Chinese economy, predicting up to 1.2 million workers in export-related industries could lose their jobs. China is Australia\u2019s biggest export market so the impact on the local economy could be serious. Any widespread slowdown in China would reduce demand for Australian industrial commodities such as iron ore and coal, and could also hurt exports of food and services to the country\u2019s middle class. Capital Economics also noted that the US and China provided almost 30% of the current stock of direct investment in Australia, meaning that if the superpowers started to pull back from global agreements, it would affect Australia\u2019s open economy. Consultancy firm KPMG had also predicted that the escalation in the US-China trade war could cost the Australian economy at least $36bn over the next decade, depriving the national economy of 0.3% growth. It said Australia, will be far more heavily bruised than the European Union or Japan. Simon Birmingham, the trade minister, has warned Australian consumers will end up paying more as a result of the tariffs, while Labor\u2019s Mark Bowen said on Wednesday that he hoped China and the US could \u201csort out their issues\u201d. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t overstate it \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t be alarmist \u2013 but the downside risk for Australia is material.\u201d",

Any widespread slowdown in China would reduce demand for Australian industrial commodities such as iron ore and coal, and could also hurt exports of food and services to the country\u2019s middle class.</p> <p>Capital Economics also noted that the US and China provided almost 30% of the current stock of direct investment in Australia, meaning that if the superpowers started to pull back from global agreements, it would affect Australia\u2019s open economy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/18/australian-house-values-fall-by-13bn-in-three-months-as-capital-city-prices-slide\">Australian house values fall by $13bn in three months as capital city prices slide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Consultancy firm KPMG had also predicted that the escalation in the US-China trade war could cost the Australian economy at least $36bn over the next decade, depriving the national economy of 0.3% growth. It said Australia, will be far more heavily bruised than the European Union or Japan.</p> <p>Simon Birmingham, the trade minister, has warned Australian consumers will end up paying more as a result of the tariffs, while Labor\u2019s Mark Bowen said on Wednesday that he hoped China and the US could \u201csort out their issues\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t overstate it \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t be alarmist \u2013 but the downside risk for Australia is material.\u201d</p>",
