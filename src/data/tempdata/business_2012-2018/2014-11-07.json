If adopted, the move could wipe out vast swaths of the financial industry at a stroke in countries such as Switzerland and Luxembourg, which have for years courted the intra-group financing offices of multinational firms by operating friendly local tax regimes. Raffaele Russo, one of the OECD tax experts leading the reform programme that has come in response to increasingly aggressive tax planning by multinationals, told the Guardian that if the proposals were backed, \u201cthis will be the end of [tax] base erosion and profit shifting using intra-group financing\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Over to Greece where government leaders are expressing optimism that the debt-stricken country is inching ever closer to exiting its EU-IMF sponsored bailout programme. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Hours after euro area finance ministers agreed to consider throwing Greece a precautionary credit line, Athens\u2019 deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos said the decision had effectively launched the country\u2019s exit from often onerous international supervision. \u201cThe eurogroup meeting fits absolutely with our planning,\u201d he told reporters, reiterating that the government\u2019s aim was to strike a deal with lenders by year\u2019s end. \u201cThe goal is to have left the regime of the memorandum and troika [oversight] and to have returned to [having] a status of essential equality in the eurozone \u2026 without emergency mechanisms such as the troika. There will be nothing better. Giving its first sign of support for Athens\u2019 avowed aim to exit its economic adjustment programme by 2015, the euro group announced that it would begin discussions on the details of a new credit line for the twice-bailed out country late on Thursday. \u201cTaking into account the still fragile market sentiment and the many reform challenges ahead there is strong support for a precautionary credit line,\u201d the euro group\u2019s chairman, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said at the session. EU aid disbursements drawn down from the \u20ac240bn bailout scheme are due to expire this year. Although the credit line could be guaranteed through the European Stability Mechanism, Dijsselbloem insisted there was \u201cbroad consensus\u201d that the IMF remain involved in the new plan, the nuts and bolts of which are not expected to be finalized until the next euro group meeting on December 8 at the earliest. Venizelos made the statements as media reports filtered through that the vehemently anti-austerity main opposition leader, Alexis Tsipras, had requested a meeting with the new European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. Tsipras\u2019 radical left Syriza party has been at pains to strengthen ties with European officials amid polls that have shown it would come first if, as many expect, a snap election is held early next year. Media reports suggested that Tsipras\u2019 request had been welcomed by Juncker who has publicly criticized the young leader\u2019s policies in the past.The prospect of Syriza assuming power has unnerved the business community. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, have a good weekend, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. There was a two way pull on the market, with early gains after the ECB\u2019s hints on Thursday of further action to help the struggling eurozone economy. But worries about further Russian incursions into Ukraine, not to mention a volatile rouble, punctured the optimism, and worries about a slowdown in the banking sector with poor loan growth did not help matters. A revival in mining shares helped keep the UK market in positive terrritory, but elsewhere the picture was more negative. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 16.09 points or 0.25% at 6567.24 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.91% to 9291.83 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.89% lower at 4189.89 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 0.99% to 19,095.32 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.32% at 10,126.3 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently around 9 points or 0.06% higher after a reasonable set of non-farm payroll numbers. Martin Wolf brings the session to an end by saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t seem to have reached 100% consensus on all subjects\u201d and says another symposium next year might be needed to resolve outstanding issues. Speaking on the issue of whether the euro should have devalued, the ECB\u2019s Benoit Coeure said that, given the large eurozone current account surplus, it was not clear that a weaker euro was the right solution to growth problems. Now to questions, and asked about fiscal policy structures, Janet Yellen said: \u201cIn thinking about fiscal policy, having a long term target for sustainable debt to GDP is important.\u201d The IMF\u2019s Christine Lagarde said EU fiscal goals may need a rethink and a reset, given how the situation has evolved. ECB board member Benoit Coeure said at the Paris symposium that eurozone leaders needed to take steps on structural reform at their December meeting. He said monetary policy should be used where possible to get inflation back to 2%. Internal devaluation within the eurozone just shifted demand around, and better productivity was needed. Janet Yellen is now up, and her full speech is available here on the Federal Reserve website. Moderator Martin Wolf of the FT was having fun, by the way, when he moved from Coeure to Yellen: Banks were responsible for the financial crisis, says Raghuram Rajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India at the Paris symposium, but he wondered whether regulation had now gone too far and was hurting risk taking. He said: \u201cBanks have cried wolf too often so they have very little credibilty when they cry wolf again.\u201d But equally they are now stepping away from risks, he said. This could harm economic growth, so a balance needed to be found. More from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen at the Paris symposium (from her yet to be delivered comments), courtesy Reuters: Yellen said politicians across the globe should make sure their fiscal houses are in order during good times, so they can support economies when things go bad, blaming part of the slow recovery on weak government support. Yellen said that as the financial crisis took hold in 2008, central banks were forced to turn to unconventional tools such as large-scale bond buying programs to prop up their economies. The tools helped support domestic recovery and global economic growth, but more action from fiscal authorities would have been helpful, she said. \u201cIn the United States, fiscal policy has been much less supportive relative to previous recoveries,\u201dYellen said. On Europe, Lagarde said ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s comments that the central bank was ready to do more to stimulate the flagging eurozone economy were \u201cperfectly legimate and appropriate.\u201d Central banks need to normalise policy as the global economy and inflation return to a more usual situation, said US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, but this could lead to financial volatilily. In remarks prepared for the Bank of France symposium in Paris which she will deliver shortly, Yellen said the Fed was trying to clearly communicate its intentions on interest rates to minimise any surprises for global markets. Last week the Fed ended its bond buying programme, but markets are now awaiting the first rate rise, which is not expected to come until mid-2015. Christine Lagarde is currently speaking and said the US had communicated its intentions well and the current stance on monetary policy should be maintained. She added that the global economic situation was still brittle. Here is our full story on the US jobs numbers. The US unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since 2008 on Friday, in a move hailed as a sign of progress by economists despite 9 million people remaining out of work, writes Heidi Moore in New York. European stock markets are still down, with the FTSE 100 the only major index that is trading higher at the moment, up some 20 points, or 0.3% at 6564.88. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones opened some 40 points lower at 17514.56, a 0.2% drop, while the Nasdaq was flat. The dollar slipped initially after the headline non-farm payrolls figure came in lower than expected, but is now bouncing back as traders realise that the overall report is actually pretty strong. Ashraf Laidi, chief global strategist at trading platform City Index, says: The figures support the Fed\u2019s exit from the five-year quantitative easing, highlighting contrasting monetary policy between the US on one side, and Japan and eurozone on another, all to the favour of the US dollar. The Russian central bank said a decision to intervene in the forex markets to prop up the rouble could be taken within several minutes and without prior warning. It considers the rouble undervalued and expects a certain correction in the exchange rate. Russia\u2019s central bank said it is prepared to step up its interventions in the currency markets to defend the rouble \u201cat any moment\u201d. It added that it was willing to use other instruments (such as interest rates?) to support the currency. It also admitted that the situation is causing concern among the population. The rouble has lost nearly 30% against the dollar so far this year. The rouble is now down 0.54% on the day, less than before the statement. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, concurs: This is a strong report that suggests the first rate hike is coming soon. We expect the Fed to start tightening in March next year. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says: Buoyant labour market data, plus signs that the US economy is growing strongly despite slower growth elsewhere in many countries, adds to the likelihood of the Fed being the first major central bank to hike interest rates. Further robust data in coming months will fuel expectations that the first rate hike could occur early next year, earlier than current expectation of a mid-year hike, though policymakers will want to see wage growth revive before being comfortable with raising households\u2019 borrowing costs. \u201cOn balance this was actually a strong report, despite the headline payrolls miss,\u201d concludes Marc Ostwald, strategist at ADM Investor Services International. He notes that the US underemployment rate dropped to a new cyclical low 11.5% from 11.8% and \u201cthere has been significant acceleration in the fall in recent months, which will not go unnoticed by Yellen &amp; Co.\u201d However: Payrolls were disappointing in terms of the breadth of payrolls gains, which were still heavily concentrated in lower-paid services jobs (retail &amp; leisure/hospitality). Once markets delve into the details, they should come to the conclusion that the risks in terms of Fed rate timing is that they move earlier than June 2015. European stock markets are still in the red, while the FTSE 100 index in London is holding on its gains. It is trading some 33 points higher at 6584.36, a 0.5% rise. Germany\u2019s Dax has slipped 0.2%, France\u2019s CAC has shed 0.3%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has lost 0.9% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is down 1%. The US labour report for October doesn\u2019t really change the positive story on the US economy, says ING economist James Knightley. To recap: payrolls rose 214,000, which was a little softer than the 235,000 consensus, but there was a net 31,000 upward revision for the previous two months so in that respect the jobs number is pretty much in line with what was expected. Underemployment also fell nicely to stand at 11.5% while the proportion of people employed rose to 59.2%, the highest rate since 2009. The one real disappointment was on the wage front. Average hourly earnings continue to grow at just 2% YoY despite the employment cost index report suggesting that worker compensation costs are rising. Nonetheless, with unemployment continuing to fall, thereby shrinking the pool of available labour, we expect wages to eventually respond. While today\u2019s report is unlikely to have any major market implications, the underlying story for the household sector remains very positive. With employment rising nicely, gasoline and mortgage rates plunging and equities hitting new highs we should expect to see ongoing strong readings for consumer confidence and spending, which bodes well for 4Q GDP growth. Moreover, with the eurozone and Japanese central banks continuing to provide aggressive stimulus, the positive US dollar environment looks set to continue. A little bit for everyone in the US jobs report... At the same time, wage growth remains subdued. Average hourly earnings rose only three cents last month, leaving the year-on-year change at 2%, way below the pre-recession levels. Job growth in the US has exceeded 200,000 in each of the last nine months, suggesting the recovery is pretty solid. The non-farm payrolls figures are out. They show that 214,000 new jobs were created in the US economy last month, less than the 231,000 expected. However, September\u2019s increase was revised higher to 256,00 from 248,000 and August was also revised up to 203,000 from 180,000 so the overall picture looks better. Importantly, the jobless rate has fallen to 5.8%, the lowest since September 2008 when the financial crisis started. Economists had expected it to stay at 5.9% The Banque de France conference in Paris has a panel discussion this afternoon with IMF director general Christine Lagarde and US Fed president Janet Yellen (3.15pm until 4.45pm GMT). Returning to Mark Carney\u2019s comments earlier, my colleague Phillip Inman writes: The Bank of England may need to rescue trillion dollar financial markets in the next crisis following a shift in business lending from banks to the bond markets, Bank of England governor Mark Carney told a conference on Friday. Markets for bonds and derivatives could come under pressure in a repeat of the 2008 crisis and need the support of central bank funds following a \u201cstructural shift\u201d away from bank lending, he warned. Speaking at a gathering of central bankers in Paris, Carney said that tighter regulations imposed on banks had raised lending costs and encouraged businesses to seek loans from other sources. He said reducing the dominance of bank lending was a positive step, but could mean Threadneedle Street extending its sphere of influence to protect financial markets from collapse. Central banks have come under increasing pressure to make sure that the next crisis in the banking sector can be handled without a taxpayer-funded bailout. A series of regulatory reforms, including demands that banks hold greater reserves and conform to strict lending rules, have reduced the risk that taxpayers will need to find a rescue of the sector. But Carney conceded that the job was not yet complete. He said: \u201cThe implicit [taxpayer] subsidy to banks has come down substantially but not been eliminated. We are still working to end too big to fail\u201d. Catching up on other news... Julian Rifat, a former trader at Moore Capital, has pleaded guilty to eight instances of insider dealing, the Financial Conduct Authority said today. He is the third person to plead guilty to insider dealing offences arising out of Operation Tabernula, the FCA\u2019s largest and most complex insider dealing investigation. He will be sentenced in the New Year. You can read the full statement on the regulator\u2019s website. The rouble edged higher this afternoon amid mounting talk that Russia\u2019s central bank could act to halt the recent sharp slide. Analysts are warning of a full-blown currency crisis, with some urging the central bank to intervene. Having been in freefall this morning, tumbling over 3% against both the dollar and the euro, the rouble has clawed back some ground on hopes of an emergency central bank meeting. A source told Reuters that the bank\u2019s governor Elvira Nabiullina was holding a meeting. Dmitry Polevoy, chief Russia economist at ING Bank in Moscow, says: This is full-blown panic, with signs of a self-fulfilling currency crisis. At such times, the central bank should intervene, after all if this isn\u2019t a risk to financial stability, then what is? It\u2019s non-farm payrolls Friday! The numbers, due at 1.30pm GMT, will shed further light on the strength of the US recovery, particularly in the wake of the Fed\u2019s recent ending of quantitative easing. Daniel Sugarman, market strategist at ETX Capital, says: While no-one\u2019s hurrying to stand in front of a \u2018mission accomplished\u2019 banner just yet, the general feeling is that the US economy is strengthening significantly, and markets will be hoping that the Payroll numbers confirm this view. The estimate is for an increase of 231,000; in the past any result significantly above or below the estimated figure has caused significant market jitters. European stock markets have turned negative, dragged down by banking shares, while the FTSE is still up. The Dax in Frankfurt has slipped 0.35% while the CAC in Paris is down 0.6%. Spain\u2019s Ibex has lost 1.2% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is 1.1% lower. The London stock market is still trading some 37 points higher, at 6588.60, a 0.6% gain. Earlier, data showed France\u2019s industrial production output slipped 0.1% in September. German production saw a small rebound from August\u2019s decline, but economists are still worried that the country is sliding back into recession. What does this mean for the eurozone as a whole? Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, says: Eurozone production is still likely to have contracted in Q3, pointing to weak or even negative growth in GDP. Overall, the figures suggest that next week\u2019s German and eurozone GDP figures for Q3 will make for depressing reading and suggest that the ECB should complete its preparations for full-blown quantitative easing as quickly soon as possible. The session has finished, and Carney et al. are heading to lunch. Or rather, d\u00e9jeuner, as the programme states. Here are some more detailed quotes from Carney, courtesy of Reuters. Turning to the implicit subsidies \u2013 effectively too-big-to-fail and the likelihood of government support \u2013 trust me, when things were under stress, that subsidy was massive. It has come down, it has not been eliminated, but that is because we are still working to end too-big-to-fail. The point of all this is that under-capitalising institutions [and] implicit subsidy conferred a large advantage on bank-based finance, and not just lending but trading book finance by banks. We\u2019re working to restore market discipline. BlackRock boss Laurence Fink concurred: It\u2019s up to all of us to make markets safer and sounder and more robust. Carney finished by talking about the Bank of England\u2019s fairer markets investigation. Recommendations will be published by June next year. For markets to be effective, they also have to be fair. The Bank warned of \u201cdeep-rooted problems\u201d in the City that are undermining public trust in the financial system, when it launched a sweeping review intended to wipe out market manipulation last week, our City editor Jill Treanor reported then. Deputy governor Nemat \u201cMinouche\u201d Shafik said the behaviour of traders in foreign exchange, currencies and bonds markets pointed to a pattern of behaviour that goes beyond a few rogue players. You can read the full story here. Carney said in Paris: We are changing the incentives in the banking system. Since the crisis of 2008, virtually all credit growth has been in the capital markets. So banks have been given a series of incentives aside from capital to focus on their more traditional responsibilities [e.g. bank loans]. We are looking to change rules around securitisation. Bank loans have gone up, trading book finance is down and liquid assets have increased, Carney said, as authorities around the world sought to make the financial system more resilient to shocks. Carney has taken the podium to talk about increased capital requirements for banks and \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks. In Paris, Dani\u00e8le Nouy, president of the ECB\u2019s supervisory council, is talking about shadow banks. Mark Carney is there too but is unlikely to say much (if anything) on when UK interest rates will go up. Next Wednesday\u2019s quarterly inflation report will shed more light on the Bank of England\u2019s thinking. The pound hit a 14-month low against the dollar after the UK trade data, which showed the deficit widening more than had been expected. Sterling fell as low as $1.5802, its lowest level since September 2013. Against the euro, it lost 0.2%, to 78.34p. Meanwhile, back in London we could get a settlement for currency rigging \u201cas early as next Wednesday,\u201d Reuters reports, citing people familiar with the matter. Six major banks caught up in the investigation into forex rigging are being pressed by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, to accept fines \u2013 possibly as much as \u00a31.8bn, we reported in September. The six banks are Switzerland\u2019s UBS, American banks JPMorgan and Citigroup, along with Britain\u2019s HSBC, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland. They are expected to be fined a total of \u00a31.5bn. This would be the first settlement after a year-long investigation into allegations that traders at major banks shared client order information. In Paris, the session with Mark Carney and others has got under way. You can watch it here. It is entitled S\u2019adapter aux changements dans l\u2019interm\u00e9diation financi\u00e8re and is chaired by Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann. Hyun Song Shin, a former economics professor at Princeton, is speaking first, followed by a 30-minute debate between Carney, BlackRock boss Laurence Fink and Dani\u00e8le Nouy, president of the ECB\u2019s supervisory council. Before we switch to the central bankers\u2019 symposium in Paris, some instant reaction to the UK trade data. Alan Clarke, at Scotia Bank, says: This series is like a yo-yo. You get one good month, one bad month, one good month and so on. There has been no change in the trend - net trade has contributed very little to growth of late and there is little sign of that changing any time soon. It is the lack of domestic demand in the eurozone that means we struggle to increase our exports as much as our imports. This is probably because continental European consumers and businesses are demanding less of everything and there is not an awful lot that we can do about that apart from watch and wait for the Eurozone recovery to gain traction, or try to export more to elsewhere on the globe. Maeve Johnston, UK economist at Capital Economics, says: Looking ahead, exporters are likely to struggle further over coming months given the strong pound and weakness in the euro-zone. But with UK exports still competitively priced in foreign currency terms, we remain optimistic that exporters will benefit from stronger global growth next year and that the economy can still rebalance gradually towards the external sector over the medium term. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, says: It is disappointing to see the UK\u2019s trade deficit widen in September after some encouraging figures the previous month. While monthly figures can be erratic, the trade deficit also widened in Q3 as exports fell and imports rose. In September, the UK recorded its largest ever deficit in goods trade with Germany, partially offset by improvements in trade with China and Hong Kong. We must drastically change our approach to supporting exporters as we are failing to make adequate progress towards rebalancing the economy. The government must introduce further measures to support UK exporters around the world, including the growing economies of Asia. Back to the German data. German exports rose sharply in September, by 5.5%, almost offsetting August\u2019s 5.8% drop. But economists say this, coupled with a rebound in industrial output, may not be enough to ward off a recession. The German economy, Europe\u2019s largest, shrank 0.2% in the second quarter and another drop in the third quarter \u2013 figures are out next week \u2013 would put the country back into recession. European central bankers and economists have gathered in Paris for a symposium at the Banque de France. Central banks should be prepared to buy government bonds if yields surge, or to ward off the threat of deflation, said Christian Noyer, governor of the Banque de France and a member of the ECB\u2019s governing council. Opening the conference, Noyer also warned that ultra-low interest rates risked creating the illusion that governments could go on borrowing without making difficult fiscal choices. But there are cases where central banks should intervene, Reuters reported. In extreme circumstances a central bank should mitigate the effects of confidence shocks on sovereign yields by purchasing government bonds. Such an action may be vindicated if there are risks to macroeconomic or financial stability or even if self-fulfilling runs on public debt may be a threat to market access, or lastly to avoid the deflationary consequences of a public debt event. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is speaking this morning in Paris. He will be on a panel at the International Symposium of the Banque de France, at 10.15am GMT. Webcast at banque-france.fr/en/home.html UK trade figures out just now show that Britain\u2019s trade in goods deficit widened more than expected in September as exports to the EU were sluggish, and oil imports jumped. The Office for National Statistics said the trade gap ballooned to \u00a39.8bn from \u00a38.95bn in August. Oil imports surged nearly 28%. Britain\u2019s deficit with the rest of the EU rose to \u00a35.8bn from \u00a35.3bn in August, with exports edging up just 0.9% while imports went up 3.7%. The shortfall with countries outside Europe also widened, to \u00a34.1bn from \u00a33.7bn. The ECB will suspend crisis loan repayments over the Christmas/New Year period. It said this morning it would not conduct early repayments of its long-term refinancing operations between 24 December and mid-January. The last repayment of 2014 will be settled on 23 December. Repayments will resume on 14 January. Like last year, the ECB decided to suspend repayments of the three-year LTROs during the year-end period, \u201cin view of the expected low interest and the concentration of other operations owing to public holidays.\u201d Over in Germany, industrial production bounced back 1.1% in September, after a 3.1% drop in August. The rebound was mainly driven by manufacturing, up 1.7%, capital goods (up 4.5%) and energy (up 2.4%). \u201cToo little, too late?\u201d asks Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING. He says this morning\u2019s data from Germany show that not all is gloom-and-doom in the eurozone\u2019s biggest economy. However, the rebound of industrial production was probably not enough to get rid of all recession fears. Over the last weeks and months, the German economy has been a mystery. The slowdown story which was told by partly terrifying data, particularly from industrial activity, has not always matched gut feeling, anecdotal evidence and undebatable solid economic fundamentals. Nevertheless, it would be na\u00efve to simply deny clearly disappointing data. At the current juncture, however, and from an analytical point of view, it is still too early to come up with an all-encompassing explanation for what is happening right now in the German economy. Is the slowdown mainly the result of an abnormal volatility caused by weather effects, vacation days and the timing of school summer holidays? Or is the current slowdown the result of several weaknesses in many trading partners and, even more important, the gradual end of the positive reform-growth cycle the economy has been in for the last decade? In our view, it is a combination of the two. With today\u2019s data, bets can be placed for next week\u2019s Q3 GDP reading. It is not an easy bet. Today\u2019s rebound suggests that some of the vacation-inclined weakness is disappearing, now that most Germans are finally back at work. However, the rebound was not strong enough to take away all concerns about another contraction of the economy in the third quarter (and consequently a technical recession). The dollar is hovering close to a 4 1/2 year high against a basket of currencies, buoyed by recent strong data for the US economy. The dollar index touched a high of 88.174, its highest level since June 2010. The non-farm payrolls numbers at lunchtime could give the greenback a further lift if they point to a solid recovery in the jobs market. Most economists think some 231,000 new jobs were created in October, compared with September\u2019s strong reading of 248,000. Geoff Yu, currency strategist at UBS in London, told Reuters: We are expecting a reading of 240,000 and anything about that, in the region of 250,000 could send the dollar higher. Among today\u2019s stock market losers, car insurer Admiral, which owns price comparison site Confused.com, stands out. Shares fell as much as 3.7% after the company posted a drop in turnover amid fierce competition. Rival RSA fell 2.7%. Admiral boss Henry Engelhardt said: We anticipate that future earnings will be impacted by the decline in premiums experienced across the market in recent years, coupled with a return to higher claims inflation. \u2018Crash for cash\u2019 incidents have hit an all-time high, a report from Aviva said earlier this week. More than 50% of the insurer\u2019s fraudulent motor injury claims are being made by organised gangs. The FTSE 100 continues to march higher and is now trading 0.7% higher, or 45 points, at 6597.08. Royal Mail is one of the biggest risers, up as much as 3.3%, after a positive broker note. Goldman Sachs decided to resume its coverage of the company with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating. The FTSE hit a peak of 6904.86 in early September, its highest level since the start of 2000. In October, weak European economic data dragged down stock markets, including the London market, which slumped to 15-month lows. But it has clawed back ground since then. In other corporate news, the company that controls London\u2019s Canary Wharf, Songbird Estates, has rejected a joint takeover bid worth \u00a32.2bn from the Qatar Investment Authority and a US commercial property firm. National Grid has seen first-half profits climb 16% to \u00a31.1bn. The electrical and gas utility firm has formed a joint venture (called St William) with property developer the Berkeley Group, to build 14,000 homes across London and the south east. National Grid owns a big portfolio of surplus brownfield land which it wants to release for development. The first homes will be ready in 2017. The companies said: National Grid has over 20 sites in London and the South East with the potential to provide over 14,000 homes over the next 10-15 years. In its first phase, St William aims to develop more than 7,000 new homes, including over 2,000 affordable homes. Development at this scale would also deliver 5,500 jobs, 2 new schools and 22 acres of public open space, transforming 84 acres of former industrial land and contributing over \u00a3150m to local infrastructure and amenities. The joint venture will have funds available of up to \u00a3700m, making it one of the top ten house-builders in Britain by turnover. This is new capital which will deliver additional homes and help tackle the housing crisis. It aims to commence development activity on its first site in 2016, with the first homes being delivered in 2017. Housebuilder Bovis Homes expects to build nearly a third more homes this year than last, with average home selling for 10% more than in 2013. At the same time, it said the market was returning to a more \u201cnormal\u201d seasonal pattern (i.e. a summer lull followed by a pick-up in the autumn) after the government\u2019s Help to Buy scheme prompted a surge in housebuying last summer. All the main European stock markets are up. The FTSE 100 index has opened more than 25 points higher at 6576.68, a 0.4% rise. The Dax in Frankfurt is also 0.4% higher while the CAC in Paris has edged up 0.2%. The FTSE MiB in Milan is flat and Spain\u2019s Ibex is 0.4% ahead. Upbeat corporate results from major European companies including steel titan ArcelorMittal have lifted markets. The world\u2019s largest steelmaker, which makes 6% of the world\u2019s steel, beat analysts\u2019 expectations with third-quarter profits. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Wall Street and the dollar surged yesterday fuelled by optimism about the US economy, with the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 closing at new records. The pound and the euro slid after the Bank of England and the European Central Bank both left policy unchanged. ECB chief Mario Draghi did his best to dispel rumours of discord on the ECB governing council, insisting there was no north/south divide. Draghis\u2019s comments that the bank was unanimous in being prepared to use unconventional stimulus measures if needed gave European stock markets a lift yesterday, with the exception of Italy and Spain. All eyes are on US non-farm payrolls today, which are out at 1.30pm GMT. Wall Street analysts estimate 231,000 new jobs were created in the US economy last month, slightly below September\u2019s better-than-expected number of 248,000. The jobless rate is expected to have stayed at 5.9%, a six-year low.",

You get one good month, one bad month, one good month and so on. There has been no change in the trend - net trade has contributed very little to growth of late and there is little sign of that changing any time soon.</p> <p>It is the lack of domestic demand in the eurozone that means we struggle to increase our exports as much as our imports. This is probably because continental European consumers and businesses are demanding less of everything and there is not an awful lot that we can do about that apart from watch and wait for the Eurozone recovery to gain traction, or try to export more to elsewhere on the globe.</p> </blockquote> <p>Maeve Johnston, UK economist at Capital Economics, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Looking ahead, exporters are likely to struggle further over coming months given the strong pound and weakness in the euro-zone. But with UK exports still competitively priced in foreign currency terms, we remain optimistic that exporters will benefit from stronger global growth next year and that the economy can still rebalance gradually towards the external sector over the medium term.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, says:<strong><br></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is disappointing to see the UK\u2019s trade deficit widen in September after some encouraging figures the previous month. While monthly figures can be erratic, the trade deficit also widened in Q3 as exports fell and imports rose. In September, the UK recorded its largest ever deficit in goods trade with Germany, partially offset by improvements in trade with China and Hong Kong. </p> <p>We must drastically change our approach to supporting exporters as we are failing to make adequate progress towards rebalancing the economy.

At the current juncture, however, and from an analytical point of view, it is still too early to come up with an all-encompassing explanation for what is happening right now in the German economy. Is the slowdown mainly the result of an abnormal volatility caused by weather effects, vacation days and the timing of school summer holidays? Or is the current slowdown the result of several weaknesses in many trading partners and, even more important, the gradual end of the positive reform-growth cycle the economy has been in for the last decade? In our view, it is a combination of the two.</p> <p>With today\u2019s data, bets can be placed for next week\u2019s Q3 GDP reading. It is not an easy bet. Today\u2019s rebound suggests that some of the vacation-inclined weakness is disappearing, now that most Germans are finally back at work. <strong>However, the rebound was not strong enough to take away all concerns about another contraction of the economy in the third quarter (and consequently a technical recession).</strong><br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-11-07T09:23:38.436Z\">at 9.23am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-545c8cfde4b0cd3bb748be27\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-07T09:17:17.837Z\">9.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Dollar near 4 1/2 year high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The dollar is hovering close to a 4 1/2 year high against a basket of currencies, buoyed by recent strong data for the US economy.

      "bodyText": "Sebastian James, the chief executive of the recently merged Dixons Carphone, is tucking into a mince pie in front of a roaring fire. It feels like Christmas \u2013 there is a rope of white tinsel and baubles strung over the mantelpiece and the white faux fur rug slung over the sofa completes the effect. But the gathering is far from intimate: the crackling flames are a screensaver and we are sitting in a Christmas grotto in the middle of a cavernous hall at Birmingham\u2019s NEC where 1,000 of the retailer\u2019s top managers have gathered for a pre-Christmas jamboree. The chain\u2019s suppliers are out in force to prime Currys and PC World store bosses on the details of what are expected to be this year\u2019s top-selling gadgets. James, who claims he does all the cooking at home, got a KitchenAid mixer last Christmas, but this year he\u2019s lusting after a hi-tech drone equipped with an on-board HD camera that can potentially fly sorties of over a mile. He has the cheaper version of the Parrot \u201cquadricopter\u201d but seems taken by the potential for taking aerial footage of his four children at play. \u201cThe thing with radio-controlled helicopters is you take off and then crash in about a minute and a half. It\u2019s always a slightly tragic Christmas morning event. With these drones you take off and it\u2019s totally stable, it just hangs there and waits for your command.\u201d He accepts that at nearly a thousand pounds it might be stretch for Santa \u2013 or rather his wife, Anna \u2013 so has also let her know he would like some extra speakers for his music system. The rise of the smartphone and tablet as well as the internet of things (IoT), a phrase used to describe the trend of connecting everyday appliances such as phones, fridges and boilers to the internet, has put Dixons Carphone is in a bit of a sweet spot. Among the IoT gadgets being demonstrated in Birmingham are the sleek white Nest thermostats that enable you to adjust your heating with a tap of your mobile. There\u2019s also a wifi-enabled kettle so you can turn on the kettle before getting out of bed. And there\u2019s a dog harness to hold a GoPro camera, so owners can capture video footage from their dog\u2019s point of view. \u201cIt used to be there was one desirable item for Christmas but over the last three or four years that has stopped and we see uplifts across our range,\u201d says James. \u201cA thermostat is not a romantic gift but at least the Nest is a beautiful thing. Who\u2019d have thought a KitchenAid mixer would be the most desired gift last Christmas?\u201d Dixons Carphone is counting down the days to the new date in retail\u2019s promotional calendar \u2013 Black Friday, the annual shopping bonanza imported from the US, at the end of this month. \u201cLast year we weren\u2019t expecting Black Friday to be as big as it was and it ended up being a bloody war out there,\u201d says James. \u201cPeople were competing each other down and prices went down in a very unplanned way.\u201d The retailer has meticulously planned its strategy this year with a welter of promotions ranging from timed deals to online countdowns and in-store deals that last a day or for the weekend. \u201cWe think it will be our second-biggest promotional event after Boxing Day,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is going to be a whopper.\u201d The Black Friday phenomenon has transformed the Christmas trading peak for many retailers as it pulls forward sales usually banked in the early weeks of December. \u201cThis year we know Black Friday is going to be gigantic and then there will be a couple of weeks when people, sated with goods, will buy absolutely nothing and then sales will take off again on Boxing Day.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got very careful plans but we don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll survive contact with the enemy,\u201d he adds. That enemy includes John Lewis which this week unveiled its own drone in the shape of Monty the penguin in what promises to be another winning Christmas advert. \u201cOur principal competitors are Amazon, because it has no requirement to make money, and John Lewis because middle-class Britain has a carnal love for it which is very difficult for us to conquer,\u201d says James. Six years into a turnaround at the electricals group, James has completed a revamp of the Currys and PC World chains started by his predecessor John Browett. The group has improved ranges and customer service and sharpened prices, but James accepts it will take time for the British public to get the message: \u201cFor 30 years, we didn\u2019t do a good job of looking after the customer and we are reaping that harvest now. We\u2019ve now given good service for a couple of years but I think it\u2019s a decade before you are forgiven.\u201d",

With these drones you take off and it\u2019s totally stable, it just hangs there and waits for your command.\u201d</p> <p>He accepts that at nearly a thousand pounds it might be stretch for Santa \u2013 or rather his wife, Anna \u2013 so has also let her know he would like some extra speakers for his music system.</p> <p>The rise of the smartphone and tablet as well as the internet of things (IoT), a phrase used to describe the trend of connecting everyday appliances such as phones, fridges and boilers to the internet, has put Dixons Carphone is in a bit of a sweet spot.</p> <p>Among the IoT gadgets being demonstrated in Birmingham are the sleek white Nest thermostats that enable you to adjust your heating with a tap of your mobile. There\u2019s also a wifi-enabled kettle so you can turn on the kettle before getting out of bed. And there\u2019s a dog harness to hold a GoPro camera, so owners can capture video footage from their dog\u2019s point of view.</p> <p>\u201cIt used to be there was one desirable item for Christmas but over the last three or four years that has stopped and we see uplifts across our range,\u201d says James. \u201cA thermostat is not a romantic gift but at least the Nest is a beautiful thing. Who\u2019d have thought a KitchenAid mixer would be the most desired gift last Christmas?\u201d</p> <p>Dixons Carphone is counting down the days to the new date in retail\u2019s promotional calendar \u2013 Black Friday, the annual shopping bonanza imported from the US, at the end of this month.</p> <p>\u201cLast year we weren\u2019t expecting Black Friday to be as big as it was and it ended up being a bloody war out there,\u201d says James. \u201cPeople were competing each other down and prices went down in a very unplanned way.\u201d</p> <p>The retailer has meticulously planned its strategy this year with a welter of promotions ranging from timed deals to online countdowns and in-store deals that last a day or for the weekend. \u201cWe think it will be our second-biggest promotional event after Boxing Day,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is going to be a whopper.\u201d</p> <p>The Black Friday phenomenon has transformed the Christmas trading peak for many retailers as it pulls forward sales usually banked in the early weeks of December. \u201cThis year we know Black Friday is going to be gigantic and then there will be a couple of weeks when people, sated with goods, will buy absolutely nothing and then sales will take off again on Boxing Day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got very careful plans but we don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll survive contact with the enemy,\u201d he adds. That enemy includes John Lewis which this week unveiled its own drone in the shape of Monty the penguin in what promises to be another winning Christmas advert. \u201cOur principal competitors are Amazon, because it has no requirement to make money, and John Lewis because middle-class Britain has a carnal love for it which is very difficult for us to conquer,\u201d says James.</p> <p>Six years into a turnaround at the electricals group, James has completed a revamp of the Currys and PC World chains started by his predecessor John Browett. The group has improved ranges and customer service and sharpened prices, but James accepts it will take time for the British public to get the message: \u201cFor 30 years, we didn\u2019t do a good job of looking after the customer and we are reaping that harvest now. We\u2019ve now given good service for a couple of years but I think it\u2019s a decade before you are forgiven.\u201d</p>",

    "webTitle": "Victorian gas holders to become homes under National Grid plan", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "National Grid is to turn derelict gasworks in London and the south east into thousands of new homes in a plan to cash in on \u00a3500m of unused land. The pipes and pylons operator, which once described its property portfolio as \u201ca well-kept embarrassing secret\u201d, is teaming up with homebuilder Berkeley to build 14,000 new homes inside the M25 over the next 15 years. The plan means that some of the capital\u2019s eye-catching gas holders, built by the Victorians but out of use since the 1960s, will be demolished to make way for houses and parks, transforming 84 acres of disused brownfield land into public space. The first houses will be finished in 2017 at sites in Battersea and Rickmansworth. Twenty areas will be developed, with the final homes in Beckton expected to be completed by the early 2030s. National Grid last year began demolishing the Victorian gas holders at Battersea, known as telescopic gasometers because the inner chamber rose and fell as gas volumes changed. Their demolition, set to be complete at the end of the year, is part of a broader transformation of industrial Battersea that has seen the art deco, Grade II-listed power station transformed into luxury apartments. One apartment was bought last month by Sting and the development is being marketed at glamorous events in Los Angeles, New York, Paris and Tokyo. A three-bedroom flat in the power station development, including river views, membership of a private residents\u2019 club, on-site restaurants and cinemas, is on sale for \u00a33.6m. Affordable homes are still on the drawing board for a later stage of the development. National Grid\u2019s joint venture, called St William, will make the company one of the country\u2019s top 10 housebuilders and is expected to create 5,500 jobs. Around 2,000 (30%) of the first 7,000 homes will be classed as affordable \u2013 short of the 50% target for new developments set by the mayor of London, Boris Johnson. But Rob Perrins, managing director of the Berkeley Group, said the affordability mix was well balanced for the \u201cquite low-value areas\u201d, such as next to the Blackwall tunnel and Bethnal Green and Bow, all in the east of the capital. \u201cSome of these areas are challenging areas to develop,\u201d he said. \u201cThese sites have to be decontaminated, we are building two schools \u2026 there is going to be open space. It is a very good, affordable offer on contamination sites.\u201d The development \u201cwill make a substantial difference to the shortfall in London,\u201d he added. With enormous demand for housing in London and the south-east the developments may be welcomed by local authorities and struggling buyers. According to the mayor\u2019s office, London needs to build 42,000 homes a year for the next 20 years to cope with soaring demand as the city\u2019s population climbs to 10 million. National Grid is concentrating re-development efforts on London, where property prices are highest. But across the country it has nearly 500 disused industrial sites spread over more than 700 acres. Some of these sites are also being converted, but none on the same scale. Last year, National Grid, announced plans to demolish 76 gas holders at a cost of \u00a379m. During the interwar years, almost every town had a gas holder, sometimes called a gasometer, but most fell into disuse in the 1960s following the discovery of North Sea gas and advances in pipeline technology. Some gasometers are likely to be spared demolition and will become part of the new St William developments. The deal was announced as National Grid published its latest financial results, revealing a 12% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a31.2bn in the six months to the end of September. Operating profits at National Grid\u2019s UK electricity business rose sharply, up 22% on last year, fuelling concerns that the company is benefiting from a lax price-control system at the expense of bill payers. A new eight-year pricing regime introduced last year, by the regulator Ofgem, has been condemned as too lenient. Steve Holliday, National Grid\u2019s chief executive, defended the increase, saying the company had invested \u00a31.6bn in new infrastructure over the six-month reporting period. \u201cWe are investing enormous sums of capital in ensuring that we have modern, reliable, efficient energy networks. We clearly need to make as much as we are investing and that is what we are doing.\u201d But the Conservative MP Tim Yeo, a former chair of the energy and climate change select committee, said the company\u2019s results \u201creinforce concerns that the [price-regime] settlement is too generous to National Grid\u201d. Holliday said it was a \u201creally clever\u201d, rigorously scrutinised scheme that tied efficiencies at National Grid to customers\u2019 bills. \u201cFor every pound we are able to save, 50 pence goes back to customers. As we find new innovations and efficiencies all of those benefits are shared with customers.\u201d He promised that National Grid\u2019s contribution to consumers\u2019 energy bills would not rise in real terms for seven years. \u201cOur contribution to the electricity bill is \u00a320 \u2026 and that figure will be essentially flat right out until 2021.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>National Grid is to turn derelict gasworks in London and the south east into thousands of new homes in a plan to cash in on \u00a3500m of unused land.</p> <p>The pipes and pylons operator, which once described its property portfolio as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/15/national-grid-land-house-price-property\" title=\"\">a well-kept embarrassing secret</a>\u201d, is teaming up with homebuilder Berkeley to build 14,000 new homes inside the M25 over the next 15 years.</p> <p>The plan means that some of the capital\u2019s eye-catching gas holders, built by the Victorians but out of use since the 1960s, will be demolished to make way for houses and parks, transforming 84 acres of disused brownfield land into public space. The first houses will be finished in 2017 at sites in Battersea and Rickmansworth. Twenty areas will be developed, with the final homes in Beckton expected to be completed by the early 2030s.</p> <p>National Grid last year began demolishing the Victorian gas holders at Battersea, known as telescopic gasometers because the inner chamber rose and fell as gas volumes changed.</p> <p>Their demolition, set to be complete at the end of the year, is part of a broader transformation of industrial Battersea that has seen the art deco, Grade II-listed power station transformed into luxury apartments. One apartment was bought last month by Sting and the development is being marketed at glamorous events in Los Angeles, New York, Paris and Tokyo.</p> <p>A three-bedroom flat in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/nov/07/battersea-power-station-revamp-cinemas-hotel-london\" title=\"\">the power station development</a>, including river views, membership of a private residents\u2019 club, on-site restaurants and cinemas, is on sale for \u00a33.6m. Affordable homes are still on the drawing board for a later stage of the development.</p> <p>National Grid\u2019s joint venture, called St William, will make the company one of the country\u2019s top 10 housebuilders and is expected to create 5,500 jobs. Around 2,000 (30%) of the first 7,000 homes will be classed as affordable \u2013 short of the 50% target for new developments set by the mayor of London, Boris Johnson.</p> <p>But Rob Perrins, managing director of the Berkeley Group, said the affordability mix was well balanced for the \u201cquite low-value areas\u201d, such as next to the Blackwall tunnel and Bethnal Green and Bow, all in the east of the capital.</p> <p>\u201cSome of these areas are challenging areas to develop,\u201d he said. \u201cThese sites have to be decontaminated, we are building two schools \u2026 there is going to be open space. It is a very good, affordable offer on contamination sites.\u201d</p> <p>The development \u201cwill make a substantial difference to the shortfall in London,\u201d he added.</p> <p>With enormous demand for housing in London and the south-east the developments may be welcomed by local authorities and struggling buyers. According to the mayor\u2019s office, London needs to build 42,000 homes a year for the next 20 years to cope with soaring demand as the city\u2019s population climbs to 10 million.</p> <p>National Grid is concentrating re-development efforts on London, where property prices are highest. But across the country it has nearly 500 disused industrial sites spread over more than 700 acres. Some of these sites are also being converted, but none on the same scale.</p> <p>Last year, National Grid, announced plans to demolish 76 gas holders at a cost of \u00a379m.</p> <p>During the interwar years, almost every town had a gas holder, sometimes called a gasometer, but most fell into disuse in the 1960s following the discovery of North Sea gas and advances in pipeline technology. Some gasometers are likely to be spared demolition and will become part of the new St William developments.</p> <p>The deal was announced as National Grid published its latest financial results, revealing a 12% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a31.2bn in the six months to the end of September. Operating profits at National Grid\u2019s UK electricity business rose sharply, up 22% on last year, fuelling concerns that the company is benefiting from a lax price-control system at the expense of bill payers. A new eight-year pricing regime introduced last year, by the regulator Ofgem, has been condemned as too lenient.</p> <p>Steve Holliday, National Grid\u2019s chief executive, defended the increase, saying the company had invested \u00a31.6bn in new infrastructure over the six-month reporting period. \u201cWe are investing enormous sums of capital in ensuring that we have modern, reliable, efficient energy networks. We clearly need to make as much as we are investing and that is what we are doing.\u201d</p> <p>But the Conservative MP Tim Yeo, a former chair of the energy and climate change select committee, said the company\u2019s results \u201creinforce concerns that the [price-regime] settlement is too generous to National Grid\u201d.</p> <p>Holliday said it was a \u201creally clever\u201d, rigorously scrutinised scheme that tied efficiencies at National Grid to customers\u2019 bills. \u201cFor every pound we are able to save, 50 pence goes back to customers. As we find new innovations and efficiencies all of those benefits are shared with customers.\u201d</p> <p>He promised that National Grid\u2019s contribution to consumers\u2019 energy bills would not rise in real terms for seven years. \u201cOur contribution to the electricity bill is \u00a320 \u2026 and that figure will be essentially flat right out until 2021.\u201d</p>",

    "webTitle": "US unemployment rate falls to lowest level since 2008", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since 2008 on Friday, in a move hailed as a sign of progress by economists despite 9 million people remaining out of work. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said that the unemployment rate fell to 5.8%, as employers added 214,000 jobs in October. The average monthly gain in the past year was 222,000 . The industries that added the most jobs were \u201cfood services and drinking places, retail trade, and health care\u201d the BLS said. In its report, the BLS said that the number of unemployed has fallen by 1.2 million this year and the number of long-term unemployed has fallen by 1.1 million. Long-term unemployment is a persistent problem in the US that has vexed even top economists. \u201cThere is debate about why long-term unemployment remains so high,\u201d Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said in a speech in April. The October jobs report says 2.9 million Americans have been without jobs for 27 weeks or more, which accounts for 32% of all the unemployed people in the country. Justin Wolfers, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics, called the jobs numbers \u201ca great report\u201d and publicly hailed one of the BLS\u2019s data points, the household survey, which suggested that 683,000 people found new jobs in October. Others were sceptical of the household survey. \u201cThese data, remember, are much less reliable than the payroll numbers, and can\u2019t be taken seriously month-to-month,\u201d wrote Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics. Others warned about embracing too much optimism. \u201cWhile this is a sign that the economy is slowly moving in the right direction, if you look below the headline numbers, it\u2019s obvious that today\u2019s labor market is still far from normal,\u201d the Economic Policy Institute said. \u201cThe economy may be growing, but not enough for workers to feel the effects in their paychecks.\u201d The National Women\u2019s Law Center, similarly, objected that most of the gains were jobs gains were in low-paying minimum-wage jobs. \u201cAlthough job growth continued last month, it\u2019s troubling that half of the 214,000 jobs added were low-wage. The largest job gains were in the restaurant industry, where most of the workforce relies on tips\u2014and the federal minimum cash wage is just $2.13 an hour. Finding a job that pays poverty-level wages doesn\u2019t feel like a recovery,\u201d the NWLC said. Peter Morici, an outspoken professor at the Robert H Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland, who has been critical of the Obama administration\u2019s jobs policies, put his objection vividly: \u201cOne in six men between ages 25 and 64 - too old for college and too young to retire \u2013 are jobless. Many are simply sitting at home watching ESPN and often relying on friends and relatives for support.\u201d There are indicators that the economic recovery is slower than many would like. While the so-called topline numbers \u2013 the number of jobs added and the unemployment rate\u2013- are often cited in discussions, they have their flaws. The jobless rate, for instance, has been dropping in part because it only measures people who have been actively looking for jobs; when people stop looking, they are no longer counted as \u201cunemployed\u201d according to the government figures. In addition, the number of jobs added is frequently revised, often by large margin; the BLS reserves a margin of error of 100,000 jobs. There are several other statistics that economists look for to gauge the health of the labor market. One is the number of people who are \u201cpart-time for economic reasons,\u201d which the BLS classifies as those \u201cwho would have preferred full-time employment, [and] were working part-time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job.\u201d There are 7 million Americans in that category. Another measure is \u201cdiscouraged workers\u201d who have given up looking for jobs because they believe there are none available. There are 770,000 Americans who fit that description \u2013 essentially unchanged from the same time last year. One of these telling statistics is the \u201cU-6 unemployment rate,\u201d a more expansive measure that counts the \u201ctotal unemployed, plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force, plus total employed part time for economic reasons, as a percent of the civilian labor force.\u201d That means all people who are unemployed as well as those who have taken jobs they don\u2019t want out of financial desperation. That U-6 number remains elevated, suggesting that 11.5% of the country is unemployed \u2013 in contrast to the milder 5.8% top-line unemployment rate. The U-6 rate has dropped in October, however, from 11.8% in September. Another measure that economists put emphasis on is the \u201clabor force participation rate,\u201d which measures how many Americans are working as a percentage of the overall labor force. That percentage, a very low 62.8%, is nearly the lowest since the recession of 1978. Joblessness also shows stark differences by ethnic group. The black unemployment rate, at 10.9%, is more than double the white unemployment rate of 4.8%.",

Supermarkets have also moved higher in the wake of better than expected figures from Morrisons, 2.9p better at 175p. J Sainsbury is up 11.5p to 273.7p ahead of its latest update next week, while Tesco is 7.7p better at 189.2p. Mining shares have gained ground as metal prices recover, with Fresnillo adding 24.5p to 724p and Rio Tinto rising 76p to 3043.5p. But RSA Insurance continues to fall after Thursday\u2019s update, down another 11.7p at 448.4p. Admiral has lost 15p to \u00a312.44 as it said third quarter turnover fell 3% in the face of a competitive car insurance market. Chief executive Henry Engelhardt said: We anticipate that future earnings will be impacted by the decline in premiums experienced across the market in recent years, couple with a return to higher claims inflation. National Grid has risen 4p to 921p after its half year profit rose 16% after a strong performance in the UK. But Angelos Anastasiou at Whitman Howard issued a sell note: The group\u2019s adjusted pretax profit is slightly ahead of market expectations, but in line with our number, while the earnings per share is slightly ahead of both our and the market\u2019s expectations. Overall UK returns are said to be likely to improve in the current year, whereas the US overall return for 2014 is likely to be in the range 8.5%-8.9% (compared with 9.0% in 2013. This is due to \u201cheadwinds from the removal of bonus tax depreciation (leading to additional rate base growth) and additional gas main repair costs\u201d. We remain wary of the longer term story at NG, especially in the US, and still see a lack of value at present levels. Canary Wharf owner Songbird Estates added 2p to 322p after it rejected a 295p a share bid from Qatar Investment Authority and Brookfield Property Partners as materially undervaluing the business. Peel Hunt\u2019s James Carswell said: The offer price is a 13% premium to the share price prior to the announcement, but an 8% discount to the last reported net asset value and a 16% discount to our December 2014 net asset value forecast. Given the inherent value within the development portfolio, we are not surprised by today\u2019s rejection of 295p. An improved offer remains a real possibility, and this would likely need to be around 350p or higher to be successful.",

The company, one of the country\u2019s largest housebuilders, said it was on course to complete a record 3,650 homes by the end of the year. David Ritchie, chief executive of Bovis Homes, said: \u201cThe market as a whole is still a little bit behind the previous peak. We as a business, however, are certainly moving towards a year when our volumes, our output delivery will be the most significant it has ever been.\u201d Bovis reported that trading had returned to normal conditions, with weaker demand in the summer, followed by a pick-up in sales during autumn. Last year, the housing market fell into a highly unusual pattern with demand surging over the summer, following the introduction of the government\u2019s Help to Buy mortgage subsidy scheme. Bovis, which mostly builds homes in the south of England outside London, described house prices as robust, with average sale prices expected to be 10% up on last year. It is forecasting \u201ca strong increase\u201d in profits for 2014, with higher dividends for shareholders. Rising house prices have helped the company to absorb higher wage bills for construction workers. The company\u2019s costs are 6-7% higher than last year, driven by a relative shortage of bricklayers, carpenters and groundlayers, who can command higher wages. Bovis expects the positive mood to continue next year and reported it had a \u201csubstantial\u201d order book for 2015. However, Ritchie said house prices were likely to be more subdued in 2015, as tighter availability of mortgage rates, expectations of an interest-rate rise and fragile consumer confidence contribute to cooling the market. The positive mood was largely echoed by the homebuilder Galliford Try, which also has a construction business. The FTSE 250-listed company reported that prices for its Linden homes were running ahead of forecasts. In line, with subdued demand over the summer, sales were down to \u00a3509m, compared with \u00a3560m the previous year, for the period since 1 July.

      "bodyText": "The boss of FirstGroup has slammed Labour\u2019s \u201curge to control\u201d transport services and \u201cfixation\u201d on public sector involvement in rail services, claiming that the state-run East Coast mainline will return more money to the Treasury after it is reprivatised. First is one of three firms shortlisted to take over the rail line, which has been in public hands since 2009. In that time, more than \u00a31bn has been paid in premiums by the not-for-profit body that controls it, Directly Operated Railways. While Labour has said it would not reprivatise East Coast if in power, it is making an election pledge to allow public sector companies to bid for future franchises on a level playing field with private firms. The winning bidder for East Coast is to be announced this month, with two joint ventures, Stagecoach with Virgin and the largely French state-owned Eurostar with Keolis, also in contention. First recently lost two major franchises, Scotrail and Thameslink. Chief executive Tim O\u2019Toole said: \u201cAll we can do is bid. We\u2019re in the business of improving returns to our shareholders and we can\u2019t put that at risk simply for the relief of some winning headline. So we have to stick with our discipline and believe that over the next dozen or so franchises we\u2019ll find the right opportunity for us.\u201d First was widely considered to have overbid for the West Coast mainline in 2012, in the battle with Virgin that sparked the meltdown in the rail franchising system. Since then, First has received direct awards to continue running Great Western, and O\u2019Toole said: \u201cGetting the extension of FirstGreat Western is a big step forward.\u201d The award has been controversial, as First now operates the line while paying far less to the government than under its original franchise. He said franchising was working, and said \u201cany winning bidder\u201d on East Coast will be paying higher premiums to the government than the current public sector operator, DOR, via higher rates of growth. O\u2019Toole said of Labour\u2019s plans to allow public sector bidders on future franchises: \u201cIt\u2019s something they are fixated on, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to matter a great deal, but it\u2019s a level of complexity that isn\u2019t going to deliver much.\u201d O\u2019Toole said a more urgent political issue was the country\u2019s bus services. \u201cThe people who need [them] are people who don\u2019t have cars, need to get to jobs who have to have some social mobility, and it\u2019s making sure that there is support for the bus networks that delivers the other items on the agenda, whether it\u2019s the green agenda or the support of an economy in places other than just London. It\u2019s always the first mode to be neglected and the first one to be talked about in terms of regulation \u2013 but what we really need is sensible, efficient support for the network across the UK.\u201d Labour\u2019s Mary Creagh, who held the shadow transport brief until a reshuffle this week, pledged earlier this week to give city and county regions more power to set bus routes and fares. She said: \u201cUnder this Tory-led government, buses have been pushed into a spiral of decline as passengers are priced off the network. Funding has been slashed by 17% in three years, 1,300 routes have been cut, and fares have risen five times faster than wages. Labour will give city and county regions more power over their public transport networks to provide the type of bus service that London takes for granted: fast, frequent, affordable travel and integrated Oyster-card style tickets.\u201d O\u2019Toole said he was opposed to further regulation outside London, after moves in Tyne and Wear to regulate bus networks. \u201cThe urge for control is irresistible, especially at the time of elections, but any government is going to have to confront the fact that the rollout of a regulated bus network would require enormous subsidies.\u201d He said London was a special case. \u201cIt is critical to the economy of the UK at large. There\u2019s a reason that London gets a Crossrail and nowhere else does, and people seem to understand that - and it\u2019s the same for the bus network. The issue is, can you afford to take that model elsewhere when you don\u2019t have a need for it? That is the gap in the logic of people talking about more regulation to have a \u2018London-style system\u2019.\u201d He said the north-east\u2019s push for regulation had not driven the big four bus firms\u2019 announcement this week of plans to introduce smartcards that could be used across different operators in cities around Britain. But he said: \u201cAll of us share the view that if you can resolve ticketing issues, a lot of Sturm und Drang over regulated/non-regulated goes away.\u201d He said customers would end up paying with bank cards on the bus nationwide. \u201cIn the long run, that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed. But there is an appetite for smartcards in a lot of places, so we have to go through that stage. You can\u2019t fight with your customer.\u201d First this week announced a 2.4% year-on-year increase in operating profits to \u00a3104m for the six months of 2014-2015, although revenues slid by almost \u00a3400m, due to a drop in rail subsidy.",

      "bodyText": "John Cridland wants to talk about Druids. The man who leads Britain\u2019s premier employers\u2019 group is worried by the state of the eurozone. He is nettled that the string of scandals in the City is making it harder as director-general of the CBI to make the case for pro-business policies. And he is eagerly awaiting the moment at which a growing economy will translate into higher wages. But the Cambridge historian is most passionate when he gets on to talking about the need to end the gridlock around one of Britain\u2019s main tourist attractions. \u201cIf I could have one wish from George Osborne in this year\u2019s autumn statement it is that he would agree to a tunnel under Stonehenge.\u201d Speaking ahead of the CBI\u2019s annual conference on Monday, Cridland says there have been plans since 2002 to upgrade the A303 but objections from English Heritage, the National Trust and the Druids for whom Stonehenge is a sacred site have meant the traffic jams in rural Wiltshire have continued. In recent weeks, ministers have said they would look at a tunnel, something Cridland says would cost a little more than \u00a31bn. \u201cThere are two glorified car parks in Britain\u201d, the CBI leader says. \u201cOne is the A14 in Cambridge. The other is Stonehenge. The A303 is a key arterial route from the south-west to the metropolis. Just get on with it.\u201d Improving the UK\u2019s infrastructure is just one of the items on the CBI\u2019s wish list for next month\u2019s autumn statement. He wants Osborne to commit to a \u00a3250,000 annual investment allowance for the whole of the next parliament at a cost of \u00a3670m a year from 2016-17; the extension of the research and development tax credit to include more development spending at a cost of \u00a3310m a year; and for the Treasury to use the consumer prices index rather than the retail prices index for the annual uprating of business rates. Since the CPI measure of inflation is lower than the RPI measure, that would cost the Treasury \u00a3320m a year. Cridland is generally upbeat about the state of the UK economy, although in the past few months he has become concerned about the impact of a weak eurozone on the prospects for growth. For the first time, the CBI is urging the European Central Bank to use quantitative easing to boost activity in the 18-nation single currency area. \u201cTwo months ago I would have said the UK is growing at 3% a year, that growth is broadly based, that it is service-sector led, small-business led, with plenty of opportunities around the world and business investment increasing. \u201cI still say that about the British economy. I do think it is set fair but I am more bothered about the eurozone. I sense the eurozone is slowing. Spain is on the up but from a low base. Italy is not out of recession. France is growing very little and is almost in denial about the need for structural reform. Germany is slowing rapidly. The headwinds are stronger than they were before the summer.\u201d Cridland insists, however, that Britain should not give up on Europe. Those who suggest the UK should leave the EU in favour of forging closer links with those parts of the emerging world that are growing faster are \u201cfundamentally wrong\u201d, he says. \u201cIt is not a question of either/or, it\u2019s both.\u201d UK firms have been doing well in countries such as China, where exports have doubled in recent years, but Europe remains a key market. \u201cOur exports to the Netherlands are higher than for all Bric (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries combined. I don\u2019t consider the eurozone to be a foreign market. It\u2019s a home market. It is our back garden. \u201cWhat the sceptics need to know is that our role is to be an advanced economy that services other advanced economies. We need to grow our exports to Europe as well as seizing opportunities in other markets.\u201d Cridland says he is confident the UK can emulate Germany and be a leading exporter by concentrating on the sectors where it is strong, such as upmarket consumer goods and financial services. He wants links with Europe to be strengthened by making it possible for all UK undergraduates to spend one year studying in another member state. \u201cThe eurozone is not moribund. Policymakers have saved it. Now they need to find a growth path.\u201d Germany and France, he says, should both agree to structural reforms. The Germans would reflate and invest in infrastructure in return for the French introducing reform of pensions and the labour market. The third leg of the programme would be for the ECB to move from \u201cQE-lite\u201d to the real thing. \u201cIt [the ECB] needs sooner or later to buy government bonds. That could get the European economy moving again. \u201cEuropean leaders have got a track record of doing the right thing. Sometimes it takes a bit too long\u201d. The CBI\u2019s new offices above Cannon Street station, in the heart of the City, have taken the organisation closer to the sector of the economy that has recovered fastest from the crash but has also seen its reputation damaged by a series of market-rigging scandals. Cridland does not seek to deny that business has suffered as a result. \u201cIt has become harder for me in my role as the representative of business to make the argument for pro-enterprise policies. I did not think that I would have to fight the battle for open markets, but I do. It will be hard to win those arguments unless we put our own house in order.\u201d Companies, he says, should be transparent, rather than burying their tax arrangements deep in the small print of annual reports in language that can only be decoded by trained accountants. \u201cWhat I would say to our members is that you should take a look in the mirror. If you don\u2019t like what you see, change what you do. If you do like what you see, explain what you are doing\u201d. Cridland says that one of the reasons business is currently held in low esteem is that those running companies have been richly rewarded at a time when real incomes for the rest of the population have been squeezed hard. He welcomes increased shareholder activism, which he says is forcing company boards to set a positive example. And he believes that the end of the longest squeeze on real incomes since the mid-Victorian era is in sight because increased business confidence has led to a pick-up in investment. Higher capital spending will lead to a rise in productivity, which will then boost wages. \u201cAverage earnings are currently growing at around 1% a year. They will be growing at double that rate next year and at treble that rate the year after\u201d. \u201cA wage increase has to be productivity driven. But I hope 2015 will see the wage increases I expected to see this year.\u201d",
