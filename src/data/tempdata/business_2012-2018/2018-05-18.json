      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca has been rocked by one of the biggest shareholder revolts over executive pay this year, after more than a third of investors failed to back the pharmaceutical company\u2019s remuneration report. More than 37% of shareholders voted against or abstained at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in London on Friday in the second rebuke by investors for the company in as many years. The rebellion opposed a \u00a39.4m pay package for chief executive Pascal Soriot, even though this was a drop from \u00a314.3m a year earlier, when the company suffered votes against its pay policy and warnings from shareholder advisory groups over its bonus plans. Earlier this month, the advisory group International Shareholder Services advised investors that a \u00a31.9m bonus for the chief executive was \u201cnot suitably aligned with performance\u201d, while another group, Pirc, advised shareholders to vote against the pay report, arguing that targets set by the remuneration committee were not challenging enough. Shares in AstraZeneca dropped on Friday after it revealed a 46% drop in operating profits for the first quarter, with earnings tumbling to $896m, which was much worse than feared by City analysts. It was hit by competition from generic drugs to its cholesterol fighting drug Crestor, as well as higher costs. The board receiving a grilling from investors , with one, John Farmer, saying that despite the revolt over pay last year \u201cthe remuneration is still far too high\u201d. He added: \u201c[The CEO] is being overpaid for underperformance. It\u2019s a collective shambles [on behalf of the board].\u201d Graham Chipchase, the chairman of the remuneration committee, replied saying the company was mindful of a public debate over high executive pay and the board had to support its managers through a turnaround phase, started by Soriot in 2012. \u201cIf Pascal and his team had not come along when they did, we would have been in a far worse position than we are in today,\u201d he said. The rebellion at AstraZeneca comes after investors in turnaround specialist Melrose staged one of the largest revolts this year, triggered by disgruntlement over a decision to pay a \u00a342m bonus to each of four directors. Nearly 26% of Melrose shareholders who voted at its annual meeting earlier this month failed to back its pay report, with leading City institution and top 20 shareholder Standard Life Aberdeen among the rebels. Opposition from more than 60% of voting investors forced Inmarsat to rip up its pay proposals, continuing a long-running dispute that had broken out into rebellion three times in the past six years. More than a third of Unilever investors registered opposition to its pay plans earlier this month, while Persimmon experienced a revolt against the \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d \u00a375m bonus handed to its chief executive, Jeff Fairburn. The payout was ultimately approved because nearly a third of shareholders abstained and of those who voted, 51.5% cast in favour and 48.5% against.",

Her father, Patrick, a retail expert at the GlobalData consultancy, had called on his daughter\u2019s expertise as the London schoolgirl is exactly the target customer of the Australian chain that has taken the UK by storm over the last four years. While many other UK retailers are feeling the squeeze and shutting shops, Smiggle\u2019s British sales nearly doubled to \u00a356m last year and its profits surged from \u00a33.3m to \u00a310.8m, according to accounts filed this month. The retailer, best-known for its fluorescent notebooks and sweet-smelling pencils and rubbers, has pursued an aggressive store-opening plan since arriving on British shores in 2014. Earlier this month, Smiggle (where a smile meets a giggle) made its debut on Oxford Street in London with a two-storey tween temple twice the size of its other stores. \u201cWe try and be a wholesome alternative to the dreaded screen,\u201d explains John Cheston, the retailer\u2019s Melbourne-based managing director, who is in the UK for the high-profile store opening. \u201cWe get a lot of goodwill out of that.\u201d Smiggle is after children\u2019s pocket money with its sights trained on the stationery needs, scented or otherwise, of children aged five to 14. It\u2019s a bigger market opportunity than you\u2019d think, with Sheffield-born Cheston revealing that some children turn up at his shops in affluent Surrey with a crisp \u00a350 note to spend. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for kids to have pocket money of \u00a320, \u00a330, \u00a340 a week,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have some stores where kids get \u00a350 a week and come in with a \u00a350 note.\u201d \u201cOne of the greatest things about our brand is that it transcends all demographics,\u201d says the 51-year-old, who describes himself as a \u201cnorthern kid who came from nothing\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s the little girl who is at a private prep school, has got a horse and her parents are doing really well, and she loves Smiggle,\u201d says Cheston. \u201cAt the other end there\u2019s kids from broken homes, who see their parent every few weeks, and when asked what do you want to do? will say: \u2018I\u2019d like to go to McDonald\u2019s for a happy meal, see the latest Pixar animated film and go to Smiggle\u2019.\u201d Cheston, who started his career with a traineeship at Marks &amp; Spencer, has masterminded the stationery brand\u2019s assault on the cutthroat UK market. In doing so he has put to shame the efforts of his countrymen from Wesfarmers who have crashed and burned and had to write off \u00a3500m following their disastrous \u00a3340m acquisition of Homebase. Smiggle is one of several brands owned by Just Group, a subsidiary of Premier Investments, run by retail billionaire Solomon Lew. It is the only brand that Just Group has exported to the UK and its success comes at a time when many homegrown retailers, from Mothercare to New Look, Carpetright and House of Fraser are struggling. Cheston, who regularly clocks up 30,000 steps a day patrolling shopping centres and competitors\u2019 stores, says: \u201cWe did a massive amount of reconnaissance before we committed to coming here.\u201d Cheston reckoned it would get sales of $A200m (\u00a3111m) within five years, a plan expected to involve 200 store openings. It remains on track to hit that sales target, but with 130 stores in the bag and another dozen in the pipeline it may slow the pace of openings after being surprised by the success of its website. \u201cOnline blew us away because kids don\u2019t have credit cards right?\u201d says Cheston. The problems faced by other retailers mean there is downward pressure on retail rents. \u201cIf we wanted to get to 200 stores the deals in Grimsby or Wolverhampton would be a lot more compelling than a year ago, because of people shuttering stores,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut if you are a brand that wants prime sites it\u2019s harder. I don\u2019t want to be the last man with the lights on when everyone else is walking away.\u201d Despite her passion for Smiggle, Bridie O\u2019Brien is not without criticism of the brand. In particular, she has an issue with some of the prices \u2013 \u00a318 for pencil cases and \u00a333 for a backpack, for example. \u201cI think that they could bring the prices down,\u201d she wrote. The frenzy around the brand in the early days, which Cheston likens to Beatlemania, has also been blamed for playground squabbles, with some teachers complaining its expensive novelty gear is distracting, leading to classroom bans \u2013 including at Bridie\u2019s school. Cheston is undeterred: \u201cI think anything that entices children to want to go to school is a good thing. There is a bigger issue with kids with mobile phones. \u201cIf the biggest problem in the world today is a scented pencil case and a pencil that changes colour then the world\u2019s gone mad.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A dip in the oil price and continuing worries about the US-China trade dispute left the major European markets flagging on the final trading day of the week. But they still managed to make weekly gains, with the exception of Italy - on concerns about the new eurosceptic coalition - and Spain. On Italian politics, Matteo Ramenghi, chief Investment officer at UBS Wealth Management Italy, said: Following weeks of political stalemate, the news on Friday morning that Italy is one step closer to an anti-establishment alliance will certainly have alarmed investors. In particular, markets will be wary of the lack of fiscal discipline outlined in the parties\u2019 policy plan. The final scores showed: The FTSE finished down 9.18 points or 0.12% at 7778.79 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.28% to 13,077.72 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.13% lower at 5614.51 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.48% to 23,449.65 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.02% at 10,112.4 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 17 points or 0.07%. As for oil, Brent crude is down 0.37% at $79.01 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Pharmaceutical group AstraZeneca has suffered a pay revolt at its annual meeting. Some 35% of shareholders who voted were against approving the remuneration report, as a protest against chief executive Pascal Soriot\u2019s \u00a39.4m pay package. The news came after its first quarter results came in below expectations, partly due to increased generic competition for its anti-cholesterol drug Crestor. Well the FTSE 100 didn\u2019t make it to a new peak. The UK\u2019s leading index has closed the day down 0.12% at 7778.79, but it was a close call. It recovered from a low of 7753 during the day, although it ended down from the high point of 7791. But it was the eighth week of gains, a good recovery from the lows of March. As we head into the close of European trading, markets remain marginally lower. The FTSE 100, which came within a whisker of a new record, is currently down 12 points but is off its worst levels. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: The FTSE edged away from its record closing high, in an uninspiring session ahead of the weekend. It is, however, still firmly on track for another winning week. This is its 8th consecutive winning week as low for longer interest rates, a weaker pound and stronger oil prices have kept the bulls firmly in control. The pound was trading lower versus the dollar once again on Friday, as it heads towards fresh 5-month lows. Whilst a run of soft UK economic data, a dovish Bank of England and growing concerns over the future health of the UK labour market has been weighing on demand for the pound over the past month, the negative sentiment intensified this week by the return of Brexit fears and an ever-stronger US dollar. With the UK economic calendar quiet for the first part of next week, investors will need to wait until Wednesday\u2019s inflation data for any hope of a meaningful change in direction for the battered pound. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Though it came close, the FTSE couldn\u2019t quite hit 7800, or surpass January\u2019s all-time intraday high. To be fair to the index, it would have had to magic momentum out of nothing this Friday to do so. Brent Crude slunk back below $79.50 per barrel as the day went on, ruling that out as a boost; and while cable was down 0.3%, pushing sterling towards a fresh 4 month nadir, it wasn\u2019t substantial enough a loss to reignite the UK index. Of course, the market has not quite closed yet, and a 12 point decline could easily be overturned in the next few minutes. Uncertainty over the US-China trade talks means stock markets are likely to remain nervious, says David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK: There continues to be uncertainty and confusion over how US trade talks with China are going. There was a report that China agreed to cut the trade deficit by $200 billion, but that was denied by the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Things are still up in the air in relation to how the trade negotiations will play out, and dealers are likely to remain cautious until we get clarification. TGI Fridays faced protests outside restaurants in London and Milton Keynes as waiting staff joined in the UK\u2019s first strike over tipping. In February, the casual dining chain, which has 83 outlets, began redistributing 40% of service charge payments paid on credit and debit cards to back-of-house employees, including kitchen staff, in lieu of a wage increase. Waiting staff are angry about the loss of card tips, about which the Unite union claims they were not properly consulted. Kitchen staff are said to be unhappy about being offered a share of tips, rather than a rise in basic pay. Workers say the change is linked to increases in the legal minimum wage, which has forced the restaurant to put up waiters\u2019 pay. Those increases, they say, have gradually eroded the differential with kitchen staff who have historically earned a bigger salary but not had a share of tips. The full story is here: Developments in the tax case involving Ireland and Apple. Reuters reports: Apple has paid \u20ac1.5bn ($1.76bn) into an escrow account set up by the Irish government to hold \u20ac13bn in disputed taxes, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said on Friday. The European Commission ordered Apple in August 2016 to pay the taxes it ruled it had received as illegal state aid, as part of its wider drive against what it says are sweetheart tax deals usually used by smaller states in the bloc to lure multinational companies and their jobs and investment. Both Apple and Dublin are appealing the ruling, saying the iPhone maker\u2019s tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law. Last October the Commission said it was taking Dublin to the European Court of Justice over delays in recovering the money that was due to be recovered in January 2017, four months on from the initial ruling in August 2016. The commission has been pressurising Ireland to recover the taxes as soon as possible to allow it to close the EU Court of Justice\u2019s action for missing the deadline. With continuing concerns about the trade talks between the US and China, along with oil prices coming off their peak and some profit taking in technology companies, Wall Street is off to an uncertain start. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 38 points or 0.16% but the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.15% and the Nasdaq Composite has lost 0.11%. The FTSE 100 came within a whisker of a new all time high earlier in the day, touching 7791.41 (the record is 7792.56 set on 12 January). But following that failed attempt to reach a new peak, the UK\u2019s leading index is now down 0.36% at 7759. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: The FTSE100 is slightly offside today, but still positive for the week... Small losses are in spite of what is normally helpful sterling weakness (EU customs backstop agreed, Bank of England scared off from rate hike), exacerbated by additional dollar strength (US 10 year bond yields above 3%, Fed hiking) that is causing oil to pause and putting pressure on metals and miners. Blame can also be pinned on disappointing results for heavyweight AstraZeneca and some profit taking in certain names following strong rallies, perhaps fuelled by geopolitical rumblings (North Korea, US, Italy) although not enough to cause panic. Meanwhile Brent is at $79.66 a barrel, having breached the $80 level on Thursday on concerns of supply disruption following Donald Trump pulling out of the nuclear deal with Iran. Italy\u2019s main stock market is down sharply while government borrowing costs have hit seven-month highs after the newly-formed coalition vowed to ramp up spending. The deal between the League and the 5-Star Movement puts Italy on a potential collision course with the EU and risks a further increase in debt, and that is making investors nervous. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB index is down 1.4% 23,460, while the yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds rose 10 basis points to 2.22%. BP chief executive Bob Dudley expects a flood of US shale and an increased supply from OPEC to weigh on oil prices, which hit $80 a barrel on Thursday for the first time since 2014. Dudley told Reuters that BP is factoring in a price of $50-$65 a barrel: Clearly the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal has brought a lot of uncertainty to the market. He suggested that a $50-$65 range would reflect a reasonable price, neither too high nor too low: Two years ago, when the price was $27, it was great for global growth, the engines of consuming economies. But it was terrible for producing countries and that led to producing countries not being able to purchase things as well. That was not a healthy price. I think when you get above $80, that\u2019s not a healthy price either. He must really like the job.. Mothercare boss Mark Newton-Jones returns to work just over a month after being ousted, but with a \u00a3138,000 (22%) pay cut and a new job-share partner in David Wood. At least his shares are worth a bit more now after a 27% rise in the past couple of days since the struggling baby goods chain announced a restructuring and a new financing deal. Sainsbury\u2019s is stuffing its shelves in preparation for a bumper Saturday featuring a royal wedding, the FA Cup final, and some sunshine. Britain\u2019s second biggest supermarket expects to sell (on Saturday): 95,000 bottles of prosecco and champagne 645,000 punnets of strawberries 6,000 Taste the Difference lemon cakes And as Chelsea take on Manchester United in the FA Cup Final, Sainsbury\u2019s is predicting a 50% increase in beer and cider sales, a 30% rise in chicken wings, and a 20% increase in crisps sales (compared with a typical week). The bunting is up, the picnics are packed, and Marks &amp; Spencer has come up with a new way to capitalise on celebrate the royal wedding. For one weekend only, Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s store in the centre of Windsor has been renamed Markle &amp; Sparkle. Here is a snap of the town crier joining in the festivities with Percy &amp; Penny Pig a day before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle marry at Windsor Castle: Carpetright shares have risen 9.8% to 36.5p a share after the troubled floorings firm announced plans to raise \u00a360m by issuing new shares. It comes at a tough time for the retailer, which is closing 92 stores and has warned full-year losses will be double those previously expected. The shares will be priced at 28p a share, representing a 15.8% discount to Thursday\u2019s closing price of 33.25p. Analyst David Madden from CMC Markets, says the share issue could be a positive step for Carpetright: The funds will be used to pay down unsecured loans and implement a revised business plan. Carpetright has been struggling for years, but if the share issue is successful this could be its first step in the road to recovery. Low-paid work has fallen to the lowest level since the early 1980s according to the Resolution Foundation. In a report published overnight, the think tank said the share of employees who are officially classified as low paid \u2013 earning less than around \u00a38.50 an hour \u2013 has fallen to 18%, the lowest since 1982. Conor D\u2019Arcy, senior policy analyst, said policymakers should not become complacent: The national living wage was the bold policy we needed to kick start a low-pay revolution, and it has seen low pay fall to its lowest levels since the early 1980s. But now is not the time for complacency. A higher minimum wage cannot solve all our low-pay challenges. Workers today too often find themselves stuck on the shop floor with no chance to move up the ladder. Many are employed by one of a handful of big-hiring but low-paying firms in an industry or local area with few other options available. Women remain far more likely to be trapped in low pay than men. Read our full story here: The pound is under pressure this morning as uncertainty persists about whether the UK will stay in the customs union after Brexit. Prime minister Theresa May said on Thursday that Britain will leave, but there is also speculation that Britain might remain within the union for a period of time beyond the transitional arrangement. Markets do not like uncertainty... The pound is down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.3481. It is down 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1443. AstraZeneca\u2019s annual shareholder meeting this afternoon could be a tricky one for chief executive Pascal Soriot, who is facing an investor revolt over his \u00a39.4m pay package. Sarah Wilson, chief executive of the shareholder advisory group Minerva, told the BBC\u2019s Today programme: There are plenty of aspects of AstraZeneca\u2019s pay that are definitely cause for concern for many shareholders. There\u2019s very poor disclosure about the targets and also we\u2019re not seeing that the chief executive and the executives are actually building up any real share ownership. It\u2019s a very complex scheme and it is interesting because the City has been asking for simplification ... you end up with some extraordinary numbers at the end of it that don\u2019t seem to stack up for people. AstraZeneca is the biggest FTSE faller this morning after the drugs giant reported a weaker-than-expected first-quarter. Shares are down 2.7% after the company blamed generic competition to its cholesterol fighting drug, Crestor, and high costs. The biggest fallers: Charlotte Hogg said she the events of last year have changed her leadership style: I think it also has made me a different kind of leader in the organisation I\u2019m in today. I hope it makes me a more positive one actually, because when something bad happens and you bounce back you see the possibilities in life and that\u2019s a wonderful place to be. The other thing is whenever I see someone going through a rough time, I try to reach out. I hoped I did it before, but I\u2019m pretty certain I\u2019d do it every time now. One wonders whether Hogg reached out to her former colleague, Ben Broadbent, a deputy governor of the Bank who was heavily criticised this week for saying the economy was in a \u201cmenopausal\u201d phase, past its productive peak: Charlotte Hogg has spoken about the lessons she learned after the \u201cmistake\u201d that ended her career at the Bank of England last year. Hogg resigned as deputy governor just two weeks into the role after MPs concluded she was not up to the job because of her failure to disclose that her brother works for Barclays, which is regulated by the Bank and was a potential conflict of interest. More than a year on, Hogg - who is now the chief executive of Visa Europe - has told the BBC it was a tough time. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anybody, but there are many worse things that happen to us in life . When something very difficult happens and you are enormously well supported by your colleagues who are wonderful and also by your friends, that enables you to bounce back. I think I\u2019ve said everything I needed to when I resigned but I apologise for the mistake I made and I apologised to my colleagues and you know, we all moved on. I owned up to having made a mistake and I set the bar for what I thought the consequences of that should be. Can the FTSE push through the 7,800 mark for the first time today? Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, says that while the FTSE is in \u201cpause\u201d mode as oil dips back below $80, the day is young: Having hit an all-time closing high on Thursday, the FTSE paused after the bell on Friday, so far content just to linger in the record peak arena. With brent crude dipping back below $80 per barrel, helping nudge BP and Shell into the red, the FTSE had little reason to ascend to fresh heights. There\u2019s still a long way to do until the day is over, however, and given that all it needs is 15 or so points to hit 7,800, the chances of the index finally breaking through that landmark level are still pretty good. Strong oil prices helped to push the FTSE 100 to a record high close on Thursday of 7,787.97. Investors are more cautious this morning, following falls on Wall Street. Here are the scores so far: FTSE 100: -0.1% at 7,777 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.01% at 13,113 France\u2019s CAC: -0.3% at 5,608 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 23,742 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.3% at 10,186 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 395 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Brent crude is trading at $79.52 this morning, after rising above $80 for the first time since 2014 on Thursday. Concerns about falling oil exports from Iran, which have driven the price higher over recent days, gave way to renewed fears about a trade war between the US and China after comments from President Trump. Trump appeared to suggest that prospects of an agreement between the two countries was limited, as China had be \u201cvery spoiled\u201d on trade with the US, which had been \u201cripped off\u201d for years by China and the US \u201cjust can\u2019t do that anymore\u201d. However, Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group believes the recent rise in oil prices could regain momentum: The rally in oil has been relentless over the past two weeks, surging over 10%, before striking $80 per barrel; a 260% rally from its nadir back in 2016. With supply shortages from crisis hit Venezuela only likely to worsen, Iran sanctions just kicking in and US oil supplies drastically lower, this rally has potential to go higher. We will be bringing you more on this and all the main financial news throughout the day.",

      "bodyText": "The NHS is privately marketing a 100-year-old hospital building that provides affordable housing for 52 nurses and other key workers to property developers to create a One Hyde Park-style complex of luxury flats overlooking Hampstead Heath. The Royal Free hospital is promoting Queen Mary\u2019s House \u2013 a gift from the Lever Brothers co-founder Lord Leverhulme 97 years ago \u2013 as \u201cHampstead Gardens \u2026 a rare opportunity to create one of the most desirable new-build schemes in London\u201d. A password-restricted website set up by the Royal Free London NHS foundation trust describes the 1.6 acre site as \u201cthe last major development site in Hampstead with an unrivalled position between the heath and Hampstead Village\u201d. The hospital\u2019s Hampstead-Gardens.com website shows architect\u2019s plans to convert the site into 162 luxury flats in four five-storey blocks with underground car parks. Local agents said the three-bedroom penthouse flats could sell for up to \u00a310m each. They put the total sale value of the scheme at about \u00a3280m. The website, created with the high-end estate agent consultancy Knight Frank and the architects Ryder Architecture, tells potential builders they do not need to worry about affordable housing lowering the tone of the development as the legally required affordable units can be housed in a separate development on the main hospital site. The building, which was dedicated by Queen Mary in 1921 and rededicated by the Prince of Wales in 1992, houses 52 nurses, teachers and other key workers paying affordable rents of \u00a3551.09 a month for single rooms with shared kitchens and bathrooms. The residents have been told they may have to vacate the premises by July 2020 but the trust said it is \u201ccommitted to finding them alternative, affordable accommodation should the site be sold\u201d. Otto Schwalowsky, 26, an intensive care nurse at the Royal Free who has been living in Queen Mary\u2019s House for nine months, said it was \u201ca real shame\u201d that the hospital was considering selling the building, which was gifted by Leverhulme for use as a maternity ward. \u201cNHS hospitals have to have key worker accommodation,\u201d Schwalowsky said. \u201cWe [NHS staff] don\u2019t get a huge amount of money anyway, so it\u2019s good to be able to walk to work.\u201d Schwalowsky said he would not be able to afford to privately rent anywhere to live nearby. \u201cRents in Hampstead are at least triple [what we pay here], you\u2019d have to get a room share,\u201d he said. John Cudjoe, 63, who lives in a room a few doors down from Schwalowsky, said he was worried he might become homeless if he loses his affordable housing. \u201cA one-bed flat is about \u00a31,400 a month \u2013 that\u2019s all my wages gone. I\u2019m stuck,\u201d he said. Cudjoe, who has worked in health records at the Royal Free for 30 years and earns about \u00a319,000 a year, said the trust has sold several other key worker accommodation blocks in recent years. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be the first residential place they\u2019ve sold,\u201d he said. \u201cThey seem to be doing quite a lot of selling their affordable properties for development.\u201d The trust has not submitted a planning application to Camden council but has told developers it has held \u201ca pre-application meeting with the local authority to discuss a change of use to C3 residential\u201d. The building is classed as C2, meaning it is classified as a hospital or care homes. The plans state that no affordable housing need be incorporated into the development. It says: \u201cAs part of the sale a parcel of land located on the Royal Free Hospital Pond Street site will be made available to a purchaser to locate any affordable housing provision arising from the redevelopment of Hampstead Gardens.\u201d The trust has given guided tours of the site to local property developers and estate agents. Trevor Abrahamson, the founder of Glentree International, an estate agency that specialises in selling homes in Hampstead and Highgate to rich overseas investors, said he was given a private tour of the site 18 months ago and offered his advice on how to best maximise value from the site. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful location and undoubtedly supports luxury apartments,\u201d Abrahamson said. \u201cIt really is as extraordinary as it appears and it is very rare to find a piece of land in that location. It could easily be the One Hyde Park of Hampstead.\u201d He said he expected apartments in the building, if developed, to sell for \u00a32,300-2,500 per sq ft. The trust\u2019s plans propose four blocks of apartments comprising 113,807 ft, which at 2,500 per sq ft works out at a potential sale price total of \u00a3285m. Labour\u2019s Tulip Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, said she was worried about the potential loss of affordable housing and would contact the hospital directly. \u201cThere is a severe shortage of social, affordable and key worker housing in my constituency and we need to focus on building more homes,\u201d Siddiq said. \u201cI want to ensure that we preserve the social mix that we are so proud of across Camden and I\u2019ve always pledged to stand up for those who are being priced out of the communities that they grew up and work in.\u201d Stephen Stark, a local Conservative councillor and spokesman for planning, said he was concerned the Royal Free appeared to be marketing the development before it had formally applied for planning permission. \u201cCouncillors and local residents are very concerned about this potential development and the hospital\u2019s approach,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as ward councillors certainly wouldn\u2019t want to see just luxury homes on the site. We acknowledge the need for affordable housing, a social mix and accommodation for key workers. Hopefully we will have cross-party support in achieving that.\u201d A spokesman for the Royal Free said: \u201cNo decision has been made to sell Queen Mary\u2019s House. The Royal Free London must use its estate in the most efficient way to ensure we can deliver the very best care to our patients. With this in mind, a process to market QMH has begun to establish the level of interest in the site with a view to a possible sale in the future. \u201cAny future developers would need to also provide affordable housing in the area. Residents \u2013 who are all on short-term leases \u2013 have been informed and the trust is committed to finding them alternative, affordable accommodation should the site be sold.\u201d",

Trevor Abrahamson, the founder of Glentree International, an estate agency that specialises in selling homes in Hampstead and Highgate to rich overseas investors, said he was given a private tour of the site 18 months ago and offered his advice on how to best maximise value from the site. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful location and undoubtedly supports luxury apartments,\u201d Abrahamson said. \u201cIt really is as extraordinary as it appears and it is very rare to find a piece of land in that location. It could easily be the One Hyde Park of Hampstead.\u201d He said he expected apartments in the building, if developed, to sell for \u00a32,300-2,500 per sq ft. The trust\u2019s plans propose four blocks of apartments comprising 113,807 ft, which at 2,500 per sq ft works out at a potential sale price total of \u00a3285m. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3824076f00765da6b167b33b33759a25aba2965\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3824076f00765da6b167b33b33759a25aba2965/38_95_1284_770/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plans for Queen Mary\u2019s House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plans for Queen Mary\u2019s House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryder Architecture</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Labour\u2019s Tulip Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, said she was worried about the potential loss of affordable housing and would contact the hospital directly. \u201cThere is a severe shortage of social, affordable and key worker housing in my constituency and we need to focus on building more homes,\u201d Siddiq said. \u201cI want to ensure that we preserve the social mix that we are so proud of across Camden and I\u2019ve always pledged to stand up for those who are being priced out of the communities that they grew up and work in.\u201d</p> <p> Stephen Stark, a local Conservative councillor and spokesman for planning, said he was concerned the Royal Free appeared to be marketing the development before it had formally applied for planning permission. \u201cCouncillors and local residents are very concerned about this potential development and the hospital\u2019s approach,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as ward councillors certainly wouldn\u2019t want to see just luxury homes on the site.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At the root of the collapse of the Virgin Trains East Coast franchise, confirmed this week, was the expectation that rail passenger numbers could go only one way: up. Two decades of consistent growth had fostered the assumption that demand would keep rising, the only question being how high. That assumption has been proved wrong. Instead, demand has dropped not only on mainline inter-city routes but on commuter rail franchises and London\u2019s tube network, where annual numbers are down 1.5%. Bus journey numbers are also down, dipping under 5bn in 2017 for the first time in a decade. Even on London\u2019s comparatively cheap and regulated network they declined by 0.7%. Passenger numbers usually shadow two broad indicators: population and economic activity. The only previous drop in rail journeys since privatisation came during the financial crisis in 2008/9. Stephen Glaister, emeritus professor of transport and infrastructure at Imperial College London, says it is unclear whether the slowdown is a blip or a longterm trend. \u201cWho knows? That\u2019s a question about Brexit and the state of the economy. Rail travel is particularly sensitive, as it is disproportionately used by higher income bands and people in work.\u201d More people working from home or irregularly, as suggested by falling season ticket sales, could spell a longer-term decline. However, Glaister pointed to the impact of strike disruption and poor performance in the south-east, which accounts for 70% of rail journeys in Britain. An increase in online living \u2013 whether shopping, watching films or ordering food \u2013 has cut trips to the high street, cinemas and restaurants. The biggest growth sector in transport is in light commercial vehicles, or vans. The transport policy expert David Begg says this has a direct impact on bus travel. \u201cA third of bus passengers are headed to the shops, but retailers are making more and more money online - that\u2019s a structural change,\u201d Begg said. Also, a significant number of those not staying at home for Netflix and Deliveroo are using Uber rather than public transport, when previously they may never have considered a traditional black cab. In London, the number of licensed private hire vehicles has almost doubled in five years and there are now more than 40,000 Uber drivers on the capital\u2019s streets. Another factor cutting public transport use in London is likely to be the number of people moving out of the city, which has risen in the last five years. There are also concerns about personal safety, terror attacks and overcrowding on the tube, which TfL surveys have found are held by a significant minority. In the first three months of 2018 there were 15m fewer passenger journeys on the tube than TfL had budgeted for. Concerns are now growing over how Transport for London will sustain its finances, at a time when central government support has been reduced to zero. Congestion also deters travel, not just in London but in every big conurbation. Begg says: \u201cCongestion is the enemy of the bus. Speeds are declining by 10% a decade on average in conurbations across the UK \u2013 and that leads to a 10-14% decline in patronage.\u201d While a mass conversion to cycling, which is increasing, would take vehicles off the road, in the short term the construction of cycle superhighways has worsened traffic around London and hit the travel times and punctuality of buses. Begg, however, blames one particular policy for increasing the number of car journeys and congestion: eight years of freezing fuel duty. \u201c[That] has led to more people travelling by car. Motoring costs have been falling while bus and train fares have been going up and up. To get more people on to sustainable transport, the price signals are all wrong.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is facing the prospect of a shareholder rebellion after giving its chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta Os\u00f3rio, a pay packet that is nearly 100 times larger than the average worker\u2019s at the bank. The advisory group Institutional Shareholders Services (ISS) has recommended a vote against the bank\u2019s remuneration report at the annual general meeting on 24 May, highlighting discrepancies between \u201cpay and relative performance\u201d. It turned attention to an \u201cunduly complex\u201d bonus structure and said there was a \u201clack of clarity in the company\u2019s public disclosures on how bonus outcomes are actually determined\u201d. Referring to the gap between executive pay and the rest of the bank\u2019s staff, ISS added: \u201cAlthough pay ratios have not been disclosed, ISS has calculated that the CEO\u2019s pay is 95.0 times that of the average employee in the organisation.\u201d Horta Os\u00f3rio took home a total pay package of \u00a36.4m in 2017, up 11% from \u00a35.8m in 2016. It came during what Lloyds called a \u201clandmark year\u201d for the bank, having seen bottom-line profits surge 24% to \u00a35.3bn. Lloyds said in a statement it was \u201csurprised\u201d about the ISS recommendation, given that the advisory group backed the new remuneration policy at last year\u2019s annual general meeting, which implemented the pay framework. \u201cISS does not challenge the quantum of the awards, which it states are aligned with the group\u2019s strong performance, but raises concerns about the complexity of the framework,\u201d Lloyds said. \u201cWe do not agree with the assertions made within the ISS report as the group makes a high level of disclosure on the framework it operates.\u201d While ISS backed the policy, it did note some concerns around changes to deferred pay arrangements, which it said resulted in a \u201chigher proportion of the total remuneration package delivered in cash as compared to the previous policy\u201d. Around 98% of votes cast at at the 2017 meeting were in favour of the policy. Glass Lewis, another shareholder advisory firm, has recommended a vote in favour of the remuneration report. If shareholders follow the recommendations by ISS, Lloyds could be next in line following a string of shareholder rebellions over pay. The bookmaker William Hill saw more than 30% of voting investors cast ballots against the firm\u2019s remuneration report at last week\u2019s AGM. Consternation centred on a 9.1% increase in base salary for the chief executive, Philip Bowcock, which will see him take home a total of \u00a31.3m. The gambling tech firm Playtech also suffered a bloody nose after 59% of shareholder votes were cast against its own remuneration report following plans to raise the pay of its chief executive, Mor Weizer, by 78%. Meanwhile, Melrose \u2013 which sealed a controversial \u00a38bn hostile takeover of the engineering giant GKN \u2013 saw a total of 23% of shareholders reject its remuneration report following a decision to award four bosses at least \u00a342m each in 2017.

      "bodyText": "Ikea has reported a sharp fall in UK profits and pulled out of opening what would have been its second-largest store in the country. The Swedish retailer blamed higher wages and the cost of investments in its stores and website for a near-40% slump in profits in the year to 31 August 2017. Pre-tax profits slid from \u00a3140m to \u00a387m, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The figures coincided with Ikea\u2019s decision to abandon a plan to open one of its famous blue sheds in Cuerden, near Preston. The company said the store, which would have created 350 jobs in 2020, was no longer viable. The decision is another blow for the retail sector, which is reeling after a string of chains including Mothercare, Carpetright, New Look and House of Fraser announced plans to close stores. Richard Rands, the property manager for Ikea UK and Ireland, said: \u201cOur decision is due to increased development costs and delays outside of Ikea\u2019s control which no longer make this location viable. We will continue to look for new sites and opportunities in this region.\u201d Despite the fall in profits, UK sales rose 6% to \u00a31.8bn with the retailer winning market share from rivals during the period. Ikea, whose founder, Ingvar Kamprad, died in January, opened its first UK store in Warrington in 1987, but its expansion has been slow. After a seven-year hiatus Ikea has recently opened several stores in quick succession, including in Reading, Sheffield and Exeter. It is also planning a fourth London store in Greenwich and another in Lancing, near Brighton. However, the retailer is also experimenting with small Argos-style stores in town centres that are basically order and collection counters. Earlier this week the company announced that after a five-year stint as the UK boss, Gillian Drakeford would be succeeded by her deputy, Javier Qui\u00f1ones, in June.

    "webTitle": "Hotel Chocolat fires new salvo at Waitrose in chocolate war", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hotel Chocolat has opened a new front in its chocolate war with Waitrose, issuing a legal threat and offering customers an \u201camnesty\u201d on the supermarket\u2019s alleged copycat bars. The upmarket chocolatier is inviting anyone who has bought one of Waitrose\u2019s sugar-heavy \u00a32 bars to exchange it for a \u00a33.95 Hotel Chocolat slab, which lists cocoa as the primary component. Hotel Chocolat has also increased the pressure on Waitrose by instructing its lawyers to write to the supermarket demanding that it removes its bars from sale by the end of today and destroy them. The developments escalate a plagiarism dispute that began when the Hotel Chocolat co-founder Angus Thirlwell accused Waitrose last week of copying his flagship range of curvy chocolate \u201cslabs\u201d. Under the terms of the chocolate amnesty, customers cannot have eaten all of the Waitrose bar and simply present Hotel Chocolat shop staff with an empty wrapper. To receive a free Hotel Chocolat slab, they must hand over the Waitrose version either uneaten or unfinished, at any time between now and the end of this weekend. Multiple bar swaps are not permitted. \u201cWe\u2019re having a \u2018Slabgate\u2019 amnesty as a lot of people will have bought them thinking they\u2019re Hotel Chocolat quality, taken a couple of mouthfuls and realised they\u2019re actually stuffed full of sugar,\u201d Thirlwell said. \u201cPeople won\u2019t be happy and the point of chocolate is to make people happy, so the most straightforward thing we can do is invite people to bring a half-eaten bar in and get a free upgrade. We\u2019ll drop the copycat product in the bin.\u201d Thirlwell decided to escalate matters after waiting in vain for a response from Waitrose for a week, despite urging the company\u2019s executives to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d last Friday. He had yet to receive a response from the supermarket on Friday morning. \u201cWe\u2019re really surprised at the slow response, it\u2019s not what we were expecting, given their brand values and the clarity of the situation,\u201d Thirlwell said. \u201cEvery hour that it goes on, we\u2019re worried about the brand damage. John Lewis has profited from our slabs by selling them in its shops. Then their sister company is trying to tear our brand down with a cheap knock-off. \u201cIf another company is misleading the market then we require stock to be removed and destroyed. We will defend our intellectual property and there are a wide range of options available to do that. None are being taken off the table. \u201cThe deadline is later today but we haven\u2019t got very high expectations of a satisfactory response.\u201d Waitrose told the Guardian it had not copied Thirlwell\u2019s designs. \u201cWe are confident that we have not infringed any of Hotel Chocolat\u2019s designs and we refute all of the allegations made by Mr Thirlwell and Hotel Chocolat. However it is not in our interest to enter into a protracted legal dispute with Hotel Chocolat and so we are corresponding with them directly about these issues.\u201d Hotel Chocolat customers began asking whether the company was making chocolate under contract for Waitrose last week after spotting the similarity between the two companies\u2019 products. All the Waitrose bars are roughly the same size as Hotel Chocolat\u2019s and share a distinctive wavy edge that sets them apart from mass-produced bars with straight sides. One of the Waitrose bars \u2013 made of white chocolate with studs of meringue and strawberry pieces and named Eton mess after the famous pudding \u2013 is a combination almost identical to Hotel Chocolat\u2019s concoction of the same name. Waitrose\u2019s caramel crunch bar also shares several characteristics with Hotel Chocolat\u2019s Caramel &amp; Co offering, while orange and coffee-flavoured iterations echo products that the chocolatier has discontinued. Thirlwell said Hotel Chocolat had legal protection for its curved-edge design from the European Union\u2019s intellectual property office. \u201cIt\u2019s inspired by what happens when you pour molten chocolate out on to a chocolatier\u2019s marble tabletop because it spreads into a lovely curvy outline,\u201d he said.",

The existing law enables companies to exploit their workers by claiming they are self-employed. These claims are all too often justified by the dubious assumption that individual workers operate as independent businesses because they are free to allocate a substitute to do work for them. This really is absurd. Workers at some companies are made to provide a substitute if they require time off and are then threatened with a penalty or loss of work. Some self-employment.

Those tests emphasise the element of control being exercised over workers, the nature of the work undertaken, and whether the worker operates freely as an independent business.

Those tests emphasise the element of control being exercised over workers, the nature of the work undertaken, and whether the worker&#xa0;operates freely as an independent business.</p> <p>Herein lies the route to abolishing exploitation and poverty pay in the gig economy and beyond.<br><strong>Frank Field MP</strong><br><em>Labour, Birkenhead</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p>",

      "bodyText": "TGI Fridays faced protests outside restaurants in London and Milton Keynes as waiting staff joined in the UK\u2019s first strike over tipping. In February, the casual dining chain, which has 83 outlets, began redistributing 40% of service charge payments paid on credit and debit cards to back-of-house employees, including kitchen staff, in lieu of a wage increase. Waiting staff are angry about the loss of card tips, about which the Unite union claims they were not properly consulted. Kitchen staff are said to be unhappy about being offered a share of tips, rather than a rise in basic pay. Workers say the change is linked to increases in the legal minimum wage, which has forced the restaurant to put up waiters\u2019 pay. Those increases, they say, have gradually eroded the differential with kitchen staff who have historically earned a bigger salary but not had a share of tips. Speaking outside TGI Fridays in Covent Garden, central London, where strikers and supporters were chanting: \u201cForget the burgers, forget the chips, we want fair tips\u201d, one waitress who has worked for the restaurant for more than a decade told the Guardian: \u201cI absolutely think the kitchen staff should be paid more. I just don\u2019t understand why I am paying them.\u201d The waitress said the change in tips policy meant a minimum cut in pay of 10% to 15% for waiting staff who had already seen a fall in tips as more people pay by contactless or skip tipping. She calculated that she had lost about \u00a3250 since the end of February and had gone overdrawn for the first time since leaving university. The waitress added that the cut in tips was only the latest in a series of measures that had trimmed waiters\u2019 benefits. \u201cEvery time the minimum wage has gone up they have taken something back. We used to get paid extra on bank holidays, now we don\u2019t. Shift leaders used to get extra pay, that\u2019s gone.\u201d Two restaurants, in Covent Garden and Milton Keynes, were on strike on Friday while two more in the Trafford Centre, Greater Manchester, and Piccadilly, London, have voted to join action set for next Friday. Dave Turnbull, the regional officer for Unite, which has been supporting the workers, said: \u201cWe need the company to wake up and talk to us. The only way for this to be resolved is to sit down and talk about a way forward.\u201d A TGI Fridays spokesperson said: \u201cOur team members are a part of our Fridays family and we care about them. We believe all our team members should be \u2013 and are \u2013 treated and paid fairly \u2026 We are listening [to the workers] and are collectively working to find a resolution. In the meantime, we will be doing all we can to ensure our guests receive the usual great dining experience and that the restaurant remains open as normal.\u201d The TGI\u2019s dispute comes amid tough times for casual dining chains struggling with rising costs, more competition and a squeeze on customer spending. Jamie Oliver\u2019s Italian chain, Prezzo and Byron have all closed multiple outlets and asked their landlords for rent cuts. This week, Carluccio\u2019s, the Italian-inspired chain, has admitted it may close 30 outlets. Carluccio\u2019s is also seeking 67% rent cuts at about a third of its 103 sites for six months while it considers whether it can keep them open.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The East Coast has once again proved that the railway from Scotland to London is not lined with gold for private operators. This week\u2019s collapse of the Virgin Trains East Coast (Vtec) franchise marks the third time in a little more than a decade that a train company operating on that line has failed to meet its contractual obligations. The decision to return the service to the public sector for the time being was made by Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, as a precursor to a new public-private partnership. Its collapse has been described as a\u201cbailout\u201d of Vtec\u2019s owners, Stagecoach and Virgin, and has been widely criticised. It has also prompted questions about what it means for other firms that may have overbid for their franchises and, amid declining passenger numbers and lower revenues, may be struggling to meet their payments. The transport secretary insists that no other company is in a similar position and the Department for Transport has been looking to reduce the risk taken by bidders in subsequent contracts. Analysts and industry observers have identified four franchises that may be facing trouble: TransPennine Express When FirstGroup retained the rights to operate this fast train service, which links cities across the north via Manchester, the chief executive, Tim O\u2019Toole, was keen to stress it was a \u201cdisciplined\u201d bid. The group had lost a string of rail franchise competitions and was widely viewed as desperate to retain the route it had operated since 2004, previously in partnership with Keolis. In December 2015, having bid for the renewal separately, FirstGroup won it outright. It then emerged that the \u00a3313m the company had promised to pay the government over seven years was far more than other shortlisted bidders had offered: in fact, the third-place bidder said it would require a large subsidy \u2013 of \u00a3410m \u2013 to run the service. To make the franchise pay, FirstGroup needs passenger numbers to grow rapidly. Passenger numbers should be boosted by the introduction of a new fleet of trains but in its first two years it has stagnated. Greater Anglia The Dutch state-owned Abellio retained this franchise in 2016 with a commitment to pay an overall \u00a33.7bn over nine years, a figure that was substantially higher than other bidders \u2013 including FirstGroup \u2013 thought feasible. For the third shortlisted firm, National Express, once the largest player in UK rail, it was the moment when the chief executive decided that the market was unsustainable. He sold off the C2C Essex commuter service and refused to bid for any more franchises. Passenger numbers are static and the service has also had to cope with RMT strikes. But Abellio insists that investment in new trains and a wholesale replacement of the existing fleet will reduce costs and bring in more passengers. The firm has also hedged its bets by selling a 40% stake in the line to Mitsui in 2016. Northern Like TransPennine Express, this was another franchise that rival firms battled to run. It was awarded to Arriva in late 2015, who took over just before the EU referendum. The Deutsche Bahn subsidiary asked for a \u00a31.4bn subsidy over nine years to operate the franchise \u2013 a whopping \u00a3800m less than the third-placed shortlisted bidder. The German parent company may have deeper pockets than some but the service has been beset by strikes over the future of guards, and passengers have complained about delays, cancellations and overcrowding. This week, the mayor of Manchester, Andy Burnham, demanded an investigation into Northern\u2019s \u201cunacceptably poor\u201d service. South Western Railway FirstGroup won this major commuter service a year ago \u2013 pledging \u00a32.6bn to the government over seven years \u2013 in a joint-venture with Chinese operator MTR. But this franchise is another potential source of problems for the company. While the contract has a clause that would cut payments if the economy tanks, First told investors its plans were based on annual passenger growth of almost 7%. Instead, South Western has seen an unprecedented fall in passenger numbers: 16.3 million fewer people took SWT train journeys in 2017 compared with the year before. Some of that decline was the result of major engineering disruption but the rapid decline in season ticket sales was a surprise. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 May 2018 because an earlier version misnamed Mitsui as Matsui.",

      "body": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/east-coast-mainline\">East Coast</a> has once again proved that the railway from Scotland to London is not lined with gold for private operators. This week\u2019s collapse of the Virgin Trains East Coast (Vtec) franchise marks the third time in a little more than a decade that a train company operating on that line has failed to meet its contractual obligations. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/16/east-coast-rail-line-to-be-temporarily-renationalised-virgin-stagecoach\">The decision</a> to return the service to the public sector for the time being was made by Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, as a precursor to a new public-private partnership.</p> <p>Its collapse has been described as a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/07/chris-grayling-east-coast-bailout-virgin-stagecoach\">\u201cbailout\u201d</a> of Vtec\u2019s owners, Stagecoach and Virgin, and has been widely criticised.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2018-05-18T10:10:44/embed.html\" data-alt=\"graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2018-05-18T10:10:44/embed.html\">graphic</a> <figcaption>graphic</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It has also prompted questions about what it means for other firms that may have overbid for their franchises and, amid declining passenger numbers and lower revenues, may be struggling to meet their payments.</p> <p>The transport secretary insists that no other company is in a similar position and the Department for Transport has been looking to reduce the risk taken by bidders in subsequent contracts. </p> <p>Analysts and industry observers have identified four franchises that may be facing trouble:<br></p> <h2><strong>TransPennine Express</strong> </h2> <p>When FirstGroup retained the rights to operate this fast train service, which links cities across the north via Manchester, the chief executive, Tim O\u2019Toole, was keen to stress it was a \u201cdisciplined\u201d bid. </p> <p>The group had lost a string of rail franchise competitions and was widely viewed as desperate to retain the route it had operated since 2004, previously in partnership with Keolis. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/16/east-coast-rail-line-to-be-temporarily-renationalised-virgin-stagecoach\">State takes back control of east coast mainline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In December 2015, having bid for the renewal separately, FirstGroup won it outright. It then emerged that the \u00a3313m the company had promised to pay the government over seven years was far more than other shortlisted bidders had offered: in fact, the third-place bidder said it would require a large subsidy \u2013 of \u00a3410m \u2013 to run the service. </p> <p>To make the franchise pay, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/05/fall-in-rail-journeys-raises-questions-for-train-franchise-firms\">FirstGroup needs passenger numbers to grow rapidly</a>. Passenger numbers should be boosted by the introduction of a new fleet of trains but in its first two years it has stagnated. </p> <h2><strong>Greater Anglia</strong></h2> <p>The Dutch state-owned Abellio retained this franchise in 2016 with a commitment to pay an overall \u00a33.7bn over nine years, a figure that was substantially higher than other bidders \u2013 including FirstGroup \u2013 thought feasible. </p> <p>For the third shortlisted firm, National Express, once the largest player in UK rail, it was the moment when the chief executive decided that the market was unsustainable. He sold off the C2C Essex commuter service and refused to bid for any more franchises. </p> <p>Passenger numbers are static and the service has also had to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/08/rail-strikes-at-five-train-companies-as-workers-walk-out\">cope with RMT strikes</a>. But Abellio insists that investment in new trains and a wholesale replacement of the existing fleet will reduce costs and bring in more passengers. The firm has also hedged its bets by selling a 40% stake in the line to Mitsui in 2016.</p> <h2><strong>Northern</strong></h2> <p>Like TransPennine Express, this was another franchise that rival firms battled to run. It was awarded to Arriva in late 2015, who took over just before the EU referendum. </p> <p>The Deutsche Bahn subsidiary asked for a \u00a31.4bn subsidy over nine years to operate the franchise \u2013 a whopping \u00a3800m less than the third-placed shortlisted bidder. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Just say &quot;Guardian business email sign-up&quot;\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The German parent company may have deeper pockets than some but the service has been beset by strikes over the future of guards, and passengers have complained about delays, cancellations and overcrowding.</p> <p>This week, the mayor of Manchester, Andy Burnham, demanded an investigation into Northern\u2019s \u201cunacceptably poor\u201d service.</p> <h2><strong>South Western Railway</strong></h2> <p>FirstGroup <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/27/chinese-firm-help-operate-uk-south-west-trains-franchise\">won this major commuter service a year ago</a> \u2013 pledging \u00a32.6bn to the government over seven years \u2013 in a joint-venture with Chinese operator MTR. But this franchise is another potential source of problems for the company.</p> <p>While the contract has a clause that would cut payments if the economy tanks, First told investors its plans were based on annual passenger growth of almost 7%.</p> <p>Instead, South Western has seen an unprecedented fall in passenger numbers: 16.3 million fewer people took SWT train journeys in 2017 compared with the year before. Some of that decline was the result of major engineering disruption but the rapid decline in season ticket sales was a surprise.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 May 2018 because an earlier version misnamed Mitsui as Matsui.<br></p>",

The Geneva-based luxury goods group behind Cartier and Montblanc said it bought back \u20ac203m of unsold watches last year. That was on top of the \u20ac278m of Cartier watches, which start at \u00a31,000 but can cost more than \u00a320,000, it reclaimed from jewellers in 2017. When the Richemont chief executive, Richard Lepeu, who retired last year, initiated the policy in 2016, he described it as an \u201cexceptional measure\u201d in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d. The company took action after stocks of its wristwatches began building up in display cabinets in Asian markets amid a crackdown on corruption in China, where luxury products such as watches and whisky had been dished out as lavish gifts to curry favour with officials, as well as a wider sales slowdown. It was worried that unsold stock would end up being discounted in the so-called \u201cgrey market\u201d of unauthorised resellers, damaging the image and pricing power of its brands. The watches are dismantled and recycled, with the most recent stockpile stemming from its specialist watchmakers division, which includes brands such as Piaget, IWC and Vacheron Constantin. This time round the watches were being bought back from stores in European markets. The need to buy back its wares in such large quantities has affected the group\u2019s profitability. Underlying profits rose 5% to \u20ac1.8bn in the year to 31 March, a performance that disappointed investors, with the shares down 5% at SFr93.90 (\u00a369.70) at lunchtime. \u201cOverall a messy result, with the watch buyback probably hurting the underlying business in the final part of the year,\u201d the Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said. \u201cLong term the company probably did the right thing in terms of the watch clean up. However, timing is unfortunate, given the watch market recovery.\u201d In the past year the luxury watch market has recovered from a severe downturn but companies such as Richemont are under pressure to exploit digital sales channels and rekindle demand for traditional watches among younger consumers. Burkhart Grund, the Richemont chief financial officer, said the repurchases were necessary to ensure \u201chealthy inventory levels at trade partners\u201d and were now likely to have come to an end. Over the past two years, Richemont has undergone a major management shake-up, appointing a senior executive committee instead of a chief executive. It also recently acquired the internet based luxury group Yoox Net-a-Porter for \u20ac2.7bn.",
