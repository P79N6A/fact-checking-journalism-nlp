      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has been warned that the departure of chief executive Stephen Hester could cause defections from the bank and lead to a downgrade of one of its credit ratings. On Friday night ratings agency Moody's said it could downgrade the bank's intrinsic or standalone financial strength rating because of the \"heightened uncertainty regarding the future direction of the bank\". \"It cannot be discounted that the CEO's departure could also trigger further departures of senior staff, which would add further uncertainty and be potentially disruptive for the business,\" Moody's said. But it affirmed the bank's crucial long-term ratings because it expects the UK government to step in if there are problems in the future. Hester is being forced out to clear the way for the privatisation of the 81%-taxpayer owned bank next year. The warning over the possible downgrade came as RBS was caught up in an action by authorities in Singapore. Its financial regulators found that 133 traders in 20 banks attempted to manipulate interest rate and foreign exchange benchmarks. RBS is among the banks identified for the toughest punishment. In a new development in the Libor-rigging scandal, which first erupted a year ago when Barclays was fined \u00a3290m for rigging the interest-rate benchmark, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said the banks had taken action against the traders involved, who had left, been demoted or denied bonuses. Their attempts to manipulate interest rates would be mentioned in job references, MAS said. The traders were not found to have successfully manipulated interest rate benchmarks known as Sibor and Sor, or foreign exchange benchmarks, but were deemed to lack \"professional ethics\". \"Although the number of traders involved represents a small proportion of the trading community in Singapore, MAS takes a serious view of the need to uphold high standards of integrity in the industry and expects banks to foster a culture of ethical conduct among all their employees,\" the central bank said. MAS forced banks to hold more capital on reserve in Singapore for a year, with RBS, Swiss bank UBS and Dutch bank ING required to hold more than the others \u2013 up to S$1.2bn (\u00a3610m). RBS and UBS have already been fined by authorities in the UK and US a total of \u00a3390m and \u00a3930m respectively for Libor rigging. All the banks were also censured for deficiencies in governance, risk management and surveillance systems, and required to appoint an external assessor to ensure they change their systems. Some of the cases had been referred for criminal investigation by the Commercial Affairs Department and the attorney-general's chambers, MAS said, but the information available did not appear to show criminality had taken place. About 100 of the traders had either resigned or been asked to quit while those who remained had been disciplined. Disciplinary measures included \"reassignment to other jobs, demotions, and forfeiture of bonuses\", MAS said. \"The industry will put in place measures to facilitate reference checks, so that an institution would be made aware if a potential hire had been implicated in attempts to inappropriately influence benchmarks,\" it added. Bank of America, BNP Paribas and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation are each required to hold an extra S$800m while another group of banks, including Barclays and Standard Chartered, must retain up to an extra S$600m. Germany's Commerzbank was on the list but not required to hold extra capital while another group, including Citibank and JP Morgan, was required to hold up to S$300m. The action in Singapore comes in a week when the integrity of the hundreds of benchmarks used in financial markets was again called in to question when the City launched an investigation into potential manipulative traders in the currency markets. The action by the Financial Conduct Authority, the new regulator for the City, became known after Bloomberg reported allegations that traders were putting in client orders ahead of a 60-second window when the benchmarks are set. The FCA is continuing its investigation into Libor, with four other financial firms facing fines or other action while the parliamentary commission on banking standards, set up in the wake of the Barclays fine, is poised to publish its recommendations for reforming the City. The parliamentary commission is expected to clamp down on City pay, with a 10-year deferral period for bonuses and measures to make bankers more accountable. The FCA is also investigating manipulation of gas prices, while the European commission has raided the offices of BP, Shell and other oil companies to investigate allegations that oil prices had been rigged for more than a decade.",

      "bodyText": "The toasty smell of malted barley hangs in the air again at Glen Keith whisky distillery at Speyside, north-east Scotland. Inside the grey-stone walls, the stills have been fired up after nearly 15 years of silence. Officially opened on Friday, Glen Keith's revival is yet another sign of the booming Scotch whisky industry. When Glen Keith closed its doors in 1999 many locals thought they would never see it working again. Whisky was tweedy, a dad's drink, and had lost ground to wine, spiced rum and \u2013 worst of all \u2013 vodka. Potato-based vodka can be distilled in one day, a sacrilegious thought for those who worship 21-year-old single malts. Today, whisky is one of Britain's success stories. Exports have jumped 51% since 2007 to \u00a34.3bn. Some 1.2bn bottles were shipped out of Scotland last year, pouring \u00a3135 every second into Britain's parched balance of payments. Although markets in austerity-hit western European are static or declining, in Asia, South America and Africa there is a thirst for the drink Scots know as uisge beatha, water of life. This is great news for Speyside, home to almost half of Scotland's 108 distilleries. Along the banks of the river Spey, the basic ingredients of whisky \u2013 barley and spring water \u2013 are abundant, while the sheltered terrain gives Speyside whiskies a more delicate, floral flavour than the spicy concoctions of the Highlands or the smoky brews of rain-lashed Islay. Chivas Brothers, the whisky and gin arm of drinks conglomerate Pernod Ricard and owner of Glen Keith, intends to produce six million litres of spirit a year from the distillery. (Under a 1915 law the spirit is not Scotch whisky until it has been aged for at least three years.) Almost all the Glen Keith spirit will be used in blended whiskies destined for export. Blended whiskies, such as Diageo's Johnnie Walker and Chivas Brothers' Ballantine's, rather than the single malts favoured by cognoscenti, make up the vast majority of the world whisky market. As part of a \u00a340m-a-year whisky expansion programme, Chivas Brothers has secured planning permission to open a new distillery on the river Spey in 2014, and ramped up production of The Glenlivet single malt by 75%. Meanwhile, rival Diageo is building a super-distillery at Easter Ross, north of Speyside, with the aim of producing 45m bottles of blended whisky a year. \"There is great optimism about the future of the industry, illustrated by the \u00a32bn capital investment that Scotch whisky producers have committed over the next two to three years,\" said Gavin Hewitt, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association. Speyside has not seen such rapid investment since the great whisky boom of the end of the 19th century, said Robin Laing, author of The Whisky River. In the 1890s two dozen whisky distilleries were founded in less than a decade. The market became saturated and, as with tulip mania and the credit crunch, the inflated profits could not last, evidenced by the great crash of 1898. Since then, a taste for Scotch has travelled far from the glens, although many drinkers add their own twist. In Japan, drinkers add lots of cold water and ice; the Chinese put in a drop of green tea, while Spaniards fix it up with cola. Fizzy or not, Scotch consumption in Spain has nosedived in the last year. Combined sales in France, Spain, Germany and Italy fell by 6.5m cases in 2012, after a 2.5m drop the year before, according to the International Wine and Spirit Research data company. For the whisky business, it is as if all 10 million people in the Czech Republic decided to give up strong liquor. Growth is bumpy in emerging markets. Sales are still expanding rapidly in Russia, where there is a well established taste for strong spirits at extravagant prices. But in its latest figures Chivas Brothers reported weak sales in Korea and Thailand, and slowing growth in China as a government-sponsored frugality drive hits the demand for luxury goods. Christian Porta, the head of Chivas Brothers, thinks this is a short-term problem and expects strong growth in the years ahead. The growing number of high net worth individuals in emerging markets, the millions moving into higher-income brackets, as well as the desire for authenticity and heritage mean that is a product well placed to grow, he said. The export focus seems fitting at Glen Keith, which in 1958 was the first Speyside distillery to open since the great whisky crash of 1898. In the 1950s and 60s, Glen Keith mainly produced spirit for blended whiskies, which were just taking off in the US. In some respects little has changed since the Glen Keith distillers were making blended whiskies for real-life Don Drapers in the 60s. Whisky making today is more energy efficient, but the process is the same \u2013 fermenting barley to make a crude beer, distilling it twice and then ageing it in old oak barrels. Chivas Brothers has invested in a new mash tun, the giant steel vessel where malted barley is mixed with hot water, but six of the stills are original. The recipe has not changed, but the marketing has moved on. \"In the 1970s and 80s whisky was suffering,\" said Laing. \"For a while whisky was beginning to be associated with a certain image of tartan and guys in tweeds, fishing and gentleman's clubs \u2026 and young people were not really interested.\" Drinks companies have been canny about changing that image. Chivas Regal, the world's third biggest selling whisky, uses flashy advertising campaigns, such as one featuring tuxedo-clad young bucks strolling devil-may care through deserts, like James Bond after an encounter with the villain at the casino table. All this seems to be paying off. \"People are anticipating a boom in the markets \u2026 and the evidence is that is what is happening,\" said Laing.

      "bodyText": "\"People put their money in. I want them to get their money out,\" said David Cameron on Thursday, apparently endorsing the view that the public is more interested in getting its money back from Royal Bank of Scotland than seeing the bank privatised as soon as possible. The prime minister should have a word with his chancellor. George Osborne seems hell-bent on selling shares in RBS before the election in May 2015 and also appears to want the bank to perform strategic somersaults ahead of the big event. Neither ambition seems likely to allow the state to get the best price. This week's ousting of chief executive Stephen Hester may just be the start of the Treasury's fireworks. If the whispers are correct, Osborne is determined to force RBS to deliver in the next year all the things he thinks should have been done in the past three. Shrink the investment bank? The Treasury seems to want more of that, pronto. Citizens Bank in the US? The Treasury fails to see why it's still hanging around in an organisation that it wishes would shower lending on the UK economy. As for Ulster Bank, one intriguing rumour is that the Treasury would like to see it sold quickly. If these tales are well-founded, it would explain why Hester put up no resistance. The state owns 81% of RBS so the chancellor is the boss. But the game is up for an independently minded chief executive if number 11 wants to dictate strategy in detail and set priorities. The point is that Hester's vision for RBS has always had a different emphasis. On the Hester version, most of the hard work and surgery has been done. The pile of bad assets will fall to \u00a340bn by the end of this year; Ulster's problems are being dealt with soberly; and Citizens is a profitable asset so there's no point in trying to flog it at less than full value, which is what you'd get these days. Most pertinently, a Hester-led RBS would dispute the notion that the bank is still so big and complex that it can't lend to UK householders and businesses effectively. As RBS always points out, the new Prudential Regulatory Authority has deemed the capital position to be strong enough to lend freely. In other words, there's no need for more strategic fireworks. So why does the Treasury disagree? Why does it want to interfere? It is frustrated. It is not impressed by RBS' lending and thinks the bank could do more if it didn't have so many distractions. Remove the distractions and a shiny new UK-concentrated bank will emerge, runs the thinking. But it's not that simple. Banking is a world of trade-offs. For example: if you want to encourage more lending, you may also have to accept looser lending standards, which may make a bank more risky. A remedy might be to shove in more capital to support more lending. But the Treasury has refused point-blank to do that at RBS. Equally, would you really trust the Treasury to know how small the RBS investment bank needs to be to perform the limited role, on which everyone agrees, of servicing business customers? Of course not. It seems quite possible that Treasury might push too hard and cut off a source of profits. The heart of the conflict is the Treasury's pursuit of two contradictory goals. It wants a higher RBS share price to maximise the proceeds to the public purse, but it also wants a simpler bank with its lending taps in the UK set at full. On Wednesday, when he delivers his Mansion House speech, Osborne may try to argue that a happy land exists in the middle where a slimmer RBS can fire economic revival in the UK and see its virtues and clarity immediately recognised by an improved stock market valuation. Don't believe it. There are only two options for RBS. The first is to take full control, maybe tow the \"bad\" assets into a separate unit, and then direct RBS as a state-backed lender. Alternatively, you allow the board to manage within broadly-agreed parameters, which was the policy set by the last Labour government and which has prevailed until now. There are pros and cons to both approaches. But both are long-term policies and require the state to be patient in maximising the value of its shares. Osborne's mad rush to privatise to meet a politically-dictated timetable risks a complete mess -- strategic confusion, a weaker board and a lower share price. It doesn't make business sense. It was a bit rich of Borealis Infrastructure Management, and the other members of the LongRiver consortium bidding for Severn Trent, to whinge about the lack of \"meaningful engagement\" from the board of their target. Borealis didn't once bother to engage with the water company's customers. Who would have managed Severn Trent under new ownership? How would surplus investment cash be shared between shareholders and customers? LongRiver didn't think these questions needed to be answered in advance on the grounds that it was merely a \"financial buyer.\" It hasn't been paying attention. Even the water regulator has noticed that the world has changed and that the customers deserve transparent owners. If you want to own a regulated business with capitive customers, you can't be invisible these days. LongRiver's failed to bag its prey for other reasons, of course. It didn't offer a price that compelled Severn Trent's board to talk. Or, rather, Severn's hard-core shareholders didn't pressure the directors to roll over. At \u00a323 a share, the story might have been different; but, at \u00a322, LongRiver was a paddle short of a fully-equipped canoe. Well done, the shareholders. They knew the share price would fall on LongRiver's departure (it did, to \u00a317.60) but they still chose the security of inflation-proof dividends over quick thrills. Borealis, an off-shoot of a Canadian pension fund, should rethink its role in life. There's clearly a place for specialist infrastructure funds since a lot of infrastructure needs to be built. But why do they feel the need to pay top dollar for the privilege of owning outright a quoted water company? In Severn Trent's case, Borealis seemed to admire the management and liked the UK regulatory regime. So why not accumulate a decent stake at sub-\u00a318 rather to try to buy the lot at \u00a322? It would be less exciting for the deal-doers, but surely more rewarding for the pensioners at the end of the chain. It was the way to bet. Paul Tucker was hot-favourite to succeed Sir Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England but he lost to a younger man. In the circumstances, it was always unlikely that he would hang around to watch Mark Carney perform. The interesting question is who will suceed Tucker as deputy governor for financial stability. One internal candidate towers above others. He is Andrew Haldane, a brain-box who can talk in plain english. But Carney and Haldane have form. The new governor didn't like Haldane's famous \"dog catching a frisbee\" speech (it's all about timing) in which he argued that the new Basel 3 rules on banking are so complex they would fail. Since Carney is head of the Financial Stability Board, which set the rules, he was bound to be irritated. Are they friends now? We'll find out. Haldane is the best choice. Carney would be a smaller figure if he blocked the appointment.",

      "body": "<p>\"People put their money in. I want them to get their money out,\" said David Cameron on Thursday, apparently endorsing the view that the public is more interested in getting its money back from Royal Bank of Scotland than seeing the bank privatised as soon as possible.</p> <p>The prime minister should have a word with his chancellor. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jun/13/rbs-shares-fall-stephen-hester-resignation-job-cuts\" title=\"\">George Osborne seems hell-bent on selling shares in RBS before the election in May 2015</a> and also appears to want the bank to perform strategic somersaults ahead of the big event. Neither ambition seems likely to allow the state to get the best price.</p> <p>This week's ousting of chief executive Stephen Hester may just be the start of the Treasury's fireworks. If the whispers are correct, Osborne is determined to force RBS to deliver in the next year all the things he thinks should have been done in the past three.</p> <p>Shrink the investment bank? The Treasury seems to want more of that, pronto. Citizens Bank in the US? The Treasury fails to see why it's still hanging around in an organisation that it wishes would shower lending on the UK economy. As for Ulster Bank, one intriguing rumour is that the Treasury would like to see it sold quickly.</p> <p>If these tales are well-founded, it would explain why Hester put up no resistance. The state owns 81% of RBS so the chancellor is the boss. But the game is up for an independently minded chief executive if number 11 wants to dictate strategy in detail and set priorities.</p> <p>The point is that Hester's vision for RBS has always had a different emphasis. On the Hester version, most of the hard work and surgery has been done. The pile of bad assets will fall to \u00a340bn by the end of this year; Ulster's problems are being dealt with soberly; and Citizens is a profitable asset so there's no point in trying to flog it at less than full value, which is what you'd get these days.</p> <p>Most pertinently, a Hester-led RBS would dispute the notion that the bank is still so big and complex that it can't lend to UK householders and businesses effectively. As RBS always points out, the new Prudential Regulatory Authority has deemed the capital position to be strong enough to lend freely. In other words, there's no need for more strategic fireworks.</p> <p>So why does the Treasury disagree? Why does it want to interfere? It is frustrated. It is not impressed by RBS' lending and thinks the bank could do more if it didn't have so many distractions. Remove the distractions and a shiny new UK-concentrated bank will emerge, runs the thinking.</p> <p>But it's not that simple. Banking is a world of trade-offs. For example: if you want to encourage more lending, you may also have to accept looser lending standards, which may make a bank more risky. A remedy might be to shove in more capital to support more lending. But the Treasury has refused point-blank to do that at RBS.</p> <p>Equally, would you really trust the Treasury to know how small the RBS investment bank needs to be to perform the limited role, on which everyone agrees, of servicing business customers? Of course not. It seems quite possible that Treasury might push too hard and cut off a source of profits.</p> <p>The heart of the conflict is the Treasury's pursuit of two contradictory goals. It wants a higher RBS share price to maximise the proceeds to the public purse, but it also wants a simpler bank with its lending taps in the UK set at full.</p> <p>On Wednesday, when he delivers his Mansion House speech, Osborne may try to argue that a happy land exists in the middle where a slimmer RBS can fire economic revival in the UK and see its virtues and clarity immediately recognised by an improved stock market valuation.</p> <p>Don't believe it. There are only two options for RBS. The first is to take full control, maybe tow the \"bad\" assets into a separate unit, and then direct RBS as a state-backed lender. Alternatively, you allow the board to manage within broadly-agreed parameters, which was the policy set by the last Labour government and which has prevailed until now.</p> <p>There are pros and cons to both approaches. But both are long-term policies and require the state to be patient in maximising the value of its shares. Osborne's mad rush to privatise to meet a politically-dictated timetable risks a complete mess -- strategic confusion, a weaker board and a lower share price. It doesn't make business sense.</p> <p>It was a bit rich of Borealis Infrastructure Management, and the other members of the LongRiver consortium bidding for Severn Trent, to whinge about the lack of \"meaningful engagement\" from the board of their target. Borealis didn't once bother to engage with the water company's customers.</p> <p>Who would have managed Severn Trent under new ownership? How would surplus investment cash be shared between shareholders and customers? LongRiver didn't think these questions needed to be answered in advance on the grounds that it was merely a \"financial buyer.\"</p> <p>It hasn't been paying attention. Even the water regulator has noticed that the world has changed and that the customers deserve transparent owners. If you want to own a regulated business with capitive customers, you can't be invisible these days.</p> <p>LongRiver's failed to bag its prey for other reasons, of course. It didn't offer a price that compelled Severn Trent's board to talk. Or, rather, Severn's hard-core shareholders didn't pressure the directors to roll over. At \u00a323 a share, the story might have been different; but, at \u00a322, LongRiver was a paddle short of a fully-equipped canoe.</p> <p>Well done, the shareholders. They knew the share price would fall on LongRiver's departure (it did, to \u00a317.60) but they still chose the security of inflation-proof dividends over quick thrills.</p> <p>Borealis, an off-shoot of a Canadian pension fund, should rethink its role in life. There's clearly a place for specialist infrastructure funds since a lot of infrastructure needs to be built. But why do they feel the need to pay top dollar for the privilege of owning outright a quoted water company?</p> <p>In Severn Trent's case, Borealis seemed to admire the management and liked the UK regulatory regime. So why not accumulate a decent stake at sub-\u00a318 rather to try to buy the lot at \u00a322? It would be less exciting for the deal-doers, but surely more rewarding for the pensioners at the end of the chain.</p> <p>It was the way to bet. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jun/14/bank-england-deputy-governor-paul-tucker-quits\" title=\"\">Paul Tucker was hot-favourite to succeed Sir Mervyn King</a> as governor of the Bank of England but he lost to a younger man. In the circumstances, it was always unlikely that he would hang around to watch Mark Carney perform.</p> <p>The interesting question is who will suceed Tucker as deputy governor for financial stability. One internal candidate towers above others. He is Andrew Haldane, a brain-box who can talk in plain english.</p> <p>But Carney and Haldane have form. The new governor didn't like Haldane's famous \"dog catching a frisbee\" speech (it's all about timing) in which he argued that the new Basel 3 rules on banking are so complex they would fail. Since Carney is head of the Financial Stability Board, which set the rules, he was bound to be irritated.</p> <p>Are they friends now? We'll find out. Haldane is the best choice. Carney would be a smaller figure if he blocked the appointment.</p>",

The exact date of his departure from the Bank will be confirmed in due course, but it is likely to be in the autumn after Paul has provided support to the new Governor,Mark Carney, through the first months of his term of office. Until he leaves the Bank, Paul will also continue to be an active member of the G20\u2019s Financial Stability Board (FSB) and of other international committees.</p> <p>After Paul leaves the Bank, he plans to spend a period of time in academia in the United States.</p> <p>Paul said: \"It has been an extraordinary honour to serve at the Bank of England over the past thirty years. I am very proud that, through the Bank and the wider central banking community, I have been able to make a contribution to monetary and financial stability. I will continue to do so in the coming months. I am looking forward to supporting Mark Carney as he arrives at the Bank.\"</p> <p>Outgoing Governor Sir Mervyn King said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have been privileged to have had Paul Tucker as a close colleague and Deputy during my time at the Bank and as Governor. Paul\u2019s contribution to the Bank, to monetary policy, and more generally to public policy, both in the UK and in the world as a whole has been enormous. Paul has more to contribute in the future and I am very pleased that he will support my successor, Mark Carney, as he settles into the Bank.</p> </blockquote> <p>Incoming Governor Mark Carney said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It has been an enormous privilege to work closely with Paul at the FSB over the past several years. Paul has contributed immeasurably to a series of critical financial reforms, including policies to end Too-Big-to-Fail and to build more resilient derivative and funding markets. I wish Paul every success in the next phase of his career and look forward to maintaining our close dialogue on how to build a more resilient financial system that more effectively serves the needs of the real economy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51baeb19e4b0c94854d3fc83\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-14T10:06:17.629Z\">11.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Breaking news in the UK: The Bank of England just announced that Paul Tucker, its deputy governor for financial stability, is leaving.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51bae966e4b069e15632dd50\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-14T09:59:02.640Z\">10.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Analyst: Falling employment highlights growth struggle</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>That fall in eurozone employment (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jun/14/eurozone-crisis-markets-japan-greece-ert#block-51bae481e4b061b6e4c1fe5e\">see last post</a>) just shows the difficulty of returning the region to growth, says <strong>Howard Archer</strong> of <strong>IHS Global Insight</strong>.

Japan's Nikkei posted a decent-enough rebound overnight, finishing nearly 2% higher, and European markets are bouncing back this morning after four days of losses.</p> <p>The recovery in Japan came after strong US data (jobless numbers and retail sales) yesterday had eased fears over the global economy.</p> <p>But traders were also cheered that <strong>Shinzo Abe</strong> promised no let-up in in his drive to stimulate economic growth and slay inflation:</p> <p>In a video message released after his cabiet approved his economic plans, Abe declared:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The growth strategy decided today will be the starting point.</p> <p>I will ensure political stability and in the autumn I will launch the second round of the Growth Strategy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Those existing measures include ultra-loose monetary policy, more government spending, new special economic zone and incentives to boost private investment. Markets had appeared to lose faith in them this week, as the Nikkei fell and the yen strengthened, but Abe's message is that there is no turning back.</p> <p><strong>Over in Europe this morning, government debt is rallying, bringing down bond yields which had pushed higher through the week.

The protests sparked by the government's attempt to close its ERT state broadcaster will continue, as prime minister Antonis Samaras tries to hold his coalition together.</p> <p><strong>As usual I'll be watching the latest events through the day....</strong></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "As informed people in Athens point out, while the proposal sounds like a concession, Samaras's speech to his youth wing (see 6.56pm) was pretty punchy and aggressive. And it looks like another night of demonstrations in Athens, outside ERT's offices We'll see on Monday whether Samaras's offer is enough to calm the situation in Greece. Until then, good night! Antonis Samaras's new olive branch over state broadcaster ERT boils down to three points: 1) a temporary committee to hire a small number of staff to make current affairs programmes 2) a parliament vote on creating the new public broadcaster soon, maybe next week 3) loyalty and support from the junior coalition partners, to ensure the goverment keeps running. From Athens, our correspondent Helena Smith confirms that Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras appears to have backed down over the issue of closing the Hellenic Broadcasting Corp, or ERT. She tells me: He's released a statement saying that a temporary committee of wide parliamentary acceptance should now be established to appoint \"a small number of employees so that the transmission of programmes by state television can begin immediately.\" This can only be accepted as Samaras climbing down under pressure from his junior coalition partners who has threatened to pull out of the ruling alliance if a compromise was not found. That looks like a big success for the ERT workers who refused to allow the service to close down, and the tens of thousands of people who protested on their behalf in Athens, and at Greek embassies across Europe. A survey today had shown strong support for the public broadcaster: Some late news from Greece -- prime minister Antonis Samaras has apparently made an offer that would keep the news service operated by ERT open. Under the offer, a skeleton staff would keep some level of news service running until the broadcaster was relaunched, with a smaller team than before, in August. Reuters reports: Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras offered to hire a small number of workers to resume a public news broadcast, he said in a statement on Friday, in a concession to coalition partners angry over the shutdown of state broadcaster ERT. He said a special liquidator appointed for ERT would set up a committee backed by all parties to hire workers so that the news broadcast could restart immediately. He said he expected his coalition partners - who have demanded the immediate reopening of ERT - to have a \"responsible\" stance on the proposal. No response from those coalition partners, Pasok and Democratic Left, yet. They are still due to meet with Samaras on Monday to discuss the issue, so this could be a bargaining chip.... Samaras has also been giving a speech tonight, to the youth wing of his party, in which he denounced ERT as 'sinful' and full of scandal From Greece, Diane Shugart tweets some highlights: A terribly dull end to the trading week, with the FTSE 100 finishing up 3 points. Nick Fletcher rounds up the action here: FTSE 100 ends another volatile week on a calmer note. As you can see above, most other European markets finished up (while Spain's IBEX was down a teensy bit). Shares have dropped on Wall Street, though, following a surprise surge in the value of the yen. That seems to be prompted by the early futures prices for the Nikkei, suggesting Japan's main index will fall back on Monday. Round and round we go.... One for Eurozone watchers \u2013 stockbroker Dan Davies has written an interesting blogpost defending the handling of the Greek bailout, following the IMF's own report into what went wrong (released last week). Davies's argues that the media and the markets have oversimplified the IMF's message. Rather than being packed with blunders, he says the first Greek bailout actually created a valuable window to drive through reforms and restructuring before the inevitable debt writedowns. Here's a flavour: This wasn\u2019t the best of all possible programs in the best of all possible worlds. But it was a decent stab at a compromise, given the actual world that we have. It bought time, and (with the Banking Union, a new ECB governor and a roughly 50% increase in the capital base of the banking system) I do not agree that this time was entirely wasted, just because some of it was spent chasing up a blind alley of Eurobonds. As I keep saying, the IMF, ECB and Eurogroup aren\u2019t supervillains and they aren\u2019t bumbling incompetents. They are reasonably intelligent public servants, trying to deal with an almost unimaginably difficult problem (which was not created by them), under circumstances of absurdly difficult constraint (most of which, to be fair, were created by them in the first place). The IMF in Greece: Mistakes we knew we were making Back to Greece, where president Karolos Papoulias had waded into the ERT dispute saying that the state broadcaster can be \"restructured while it is still operating\" and - according to senior sources at the presidential palace - is demanding that the network be re-opened. That's via our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, who explains: Earlier this week, he told main opposition leader Alexis Tsipras that he couldn't \"intervene in the issue.\" However, the octogenarian, a former socialist minister implicitly sided with the radical leftist leader saying \"public television has to exist because people cannot only be informed by private channels.\" The word from Athens tonight is also that the country's highest court, the Council of State, will announce on Monday whether it will grant a temporary injuction to block the closure of ERT (following a petition brought by the broadcaster's staff) Lagarde went on to explain that the IMF wants the US to 'speed up' its progress on issues such as entitlement commitments (eg pensions), and applauded the US government's progress on deficit reduction (the deficit will fall by 2.5 percentage points this year). The International Monetary Fund is giving a press conference now, following their assessment of the US economy -- it's being streamed here. Christine Lagarde is explaining that the IMF wants the sequester spending cuts dropped because they will hurt economic growth at a time when there is \"limited room\" for monetary policy to help further. She also warns that those cuts to education and health spending budgets will \"hurt the most vulerable\" and have seriously damaging effects. The IMF also cut its growth forecast for the US in 2014 to 2.7%, from 3% two months ago. It left its prediction of 1.9% growth this year unchanged. Breaking: The International Monetary Fund has urged the US government to slow the pace of its deficit reduction plan, calling the current schedule \"excessively rapid and ill-designed.\" Following a regular assessment of the US economy, the IMF warned that the \"sequester\" (federal spending cuts that kicked in earlier this year) would hit growth. The IMF appeared to throw its weight behind President Obama's budget proposals. Here's the key section from the Concluding Statement The automatic spending cuts (\u201csequester\u201d) not only exert a heavy toll on growth in the short term, but the indiscriminate reductions in education, science, and infrastructure spending could also reduce medium-term potential growth. These cuts should be replaced with a back-loaded mix of entitlement savings and new revenues, along the lines of the Administration\u2019s budget proposal. At the same time, the expiration of the payroll tax cut and the increase in high-end marginal tax rates also imply some further drag on economic activity. A slower pace of deficit reduction would help the recovery at a time when monetary policy has limited room to support it further. More to follow.... Paul Tucker has been praised by Andrew Tyrie MP, who chairs the Treasury Select Committee at parliament, following his decision to quit the Bank of England this autumn (see 11am onwards) Tyrie said: Paul Tucker has done an outstanding job, not least in helping shape the international framework for bank resolution, a vital part of the regulatory response to the crisis. He has also played a crucial role in making sure that the new regulatory system remedies a central weakness of the old, and focuses on financial stability. It does feel that Tucker has timed his departure rather well. Announcing it before Mark Carney rocks up at the Bank has deprived those rotters in the press from claiming the pair had actually fallen out. And there are plenty of tasty jobs in the UK banking sector -- such as that chairmanship at Lloyds we mentioned earlier. Fast FT also pointed out that Royal Bank of Scotland is light of a CEO (and possibly a chairman too before much longer). Stranger things have happened.... The latest US consumer sentiment missed forecasts, falling back from a six-year high last month. The University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment came in at 82.7 for June, down from 84.5 in Mayy, Economists had expected no change. And yet, the reading had no impact on shares on Wall Street - where the Dow's now up 15 points (+0.1%). An article published last night by the WSJ's terribly well-informed Jon Hilsenrath, continues to drive sentiment, it seems. It predicted the Federal Reserve would try to reassure the markets next week that short-term interest rates will not rise for some time, even if QE 'tapering' begins soon. Traders in New York are in cagey mood today, matching the mood in Europe. The ringing of the Wall Street bell hasn't shaken them into life, with the Dow Jones industrial average up precisely 1 point, at 15176. Having a week of alarm over the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy, even sightly, investors may be content to sit and wait \u2013 at least until the next rumour comes along. The latest US economic data didn't provide much of a shock. Industrial production was unchanged in May, according to the Federal Reserve. Manufacturing production rose 0.1%, output at mines increased by 0.7%. but utility output dropped by 1.8%. A group of UK Uncut campaigners are holding a protest in Canary Wharf ahead of next week's G8 meeeting of world leaders, in Northern Ireland. Here's their message: They are all here. The investment banks that gambled with our homes, our jobs and our future. The ratings agencies that made massive profits while branding toxic derivatives as safe. The accountancy firms that helped write government tax policy, then advised their clients on how to find the loopholes. The regulators that looked the other way while the financial sector brought our economy to its knees. The protest appears to be proceeding calmly. Our correspondent in Greece, Helena Smith, reports that an official probe is about to be launched into possible corruption at state-run ERT. She writes: As the legal successor of Greece\u2019s state-run broadcaster, the country\u2019s finance ministry has demanded that an official investigation be launched into potential mishandling of public funds at the organisation. Appearing in parliament in robust form this morning finance minister Yannis Stournaras insisted that ERT had not been closed but was simply being \u201cre-organised.\u201d \u201cIt will open as soon as possible,\u201d he told Greece\u2019s main opposition leader radical leftist Alexis Tsipras who has repeatedly likened the decision to take the broadcaster off air to a coup. \u201cIt is going into the work shop to come out repaired, cleaned up, rid of scandals. We are giving ERT the possibility to be reborn,\u201d Stournaras said, adding that talented personnel would continue to staff the new institution. Stournaras argued that the new broadcaster would be productive and much fairer for Greek taxpayers who are burdened with carrying most of its annual \u20ac220mn budget. \u201cThe decision to abolish ERT is not pleasant for any of us \u2026 but it is a necessary and bold step,\u201d insisted the finance minister. Stournaras has reportedly instructed Eleni Raikou, a leading public prosecutor specialising in corruption, to begin the investigation. Rumour is rife that public funds were routinely mismanaged at ERT not least in the acquisition of materials and other office equipment for the state-run broadcaster. \u201cI was horrified to discover that more than 100,000 euro had been spent on decking out a single office with a new table and chairs,\u201d a former government spokesman told me. \u201cThe waste was extraordinary in a system that worked totally on political patronage.\u201d Raikou is believed to have received the order to launch the investigation in a letter from Stournaras, signifying that prime minister Antonis Samaras is clearly trying to build up a case for the controversial decision to shut down the broadcaster, Helena adds. Back to Greece, and the head of Europe's public broadcasters has called on the country's prime minister to drop his attempt to shut its state broadcaster. During a live broadcast at ERT's headquarters in Athens, Jean-Paul Philippot, president of the European Broadcasting Union, declared: We ask the government to reverse this decision, we ask the government to reestablish the signal on TV, radio and web. Philippot is in Athens toi hand over a petition signed by 51 European broadcast executives calling for the broadcaster's signal to be restored immediately. ERT staff are keeping its operations running, nearly three days after PM Antonis Samaras suddenly announced the broadcaster was to close, and reopen in August in a slimmed-down form. It apppears there is still deadlock over the issue within the coalition government, following talks this morning between minister of State Dimitris Stamatis and Fotis Kouvelis, head of Democratic Left. To Vima reports: Mr. Kouvelis reiterated his position that ERT should resume its normal operations immediately, rather than compromising the programming with reruns and documentaries. Is George Osborne feeling guilty about depriving Paul Tucker of the top job at the Bank of England? In his letter acknowledging his early departure, the chancellor hails Tucker's \"tremendous contribution to monetary and financial policy\" through his 33-year career at the Bank, and spoke of his \"intellectual capacity\" and \"high reputation\" among his peers. Concluding: I have no doubt that you will continue to make a towering contribution to the international economic community. I hope we will stay in touch and I continue to benefit from your extensive knowledge and valuable insights in the future. Here's Heather Stewart's news story on Paul Tucker's early exit from the Bank of England: And a flavour: Tucker was appointed for a five-year term, which was due to come to an end next February. His name is now likely to be linked with top banking jobs, such as the soon to be vacant chairman's role at Lloyds Banking Group, which is 39% owned by the taxpayer and could be the first of the two state-backed banks to return to the private sector. Danny Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (which sets interest rates each month), suggests Mark Carney might want to see further changes: For the inside line on the Mark Carney, the man who beat Paul Tucker to the Governorship of the Bank of England, you really should read this piece by my colleague Heather Stewart: Mark Carney: Bank governor's journey from wilderness to heart of the City It begins: Mark Carney, the Canadian banker hand-picked by chancellor George Osborne to take the reins at the Bank of England has a life motto: \"Learn, Earn, Serve\". And so far, it has all gone exactly to plan. So important was learning that as an 18-year-old he left his home country and enrolled at Harvard, then Oxford, twice, once for a masters and back a few years later for a PhD. One don who taught Carney still has one of his essays tucked away in a filing cabinet: because he rated it so highly, he took a photocopy. One of the examiners of Carney's doctoral thesis in 1995 was John Vickers (now Sir), who ran the Independent Commission on Banking. Little can he have imagined that less than 20 years later he would be competing against \u2013 and losing out to \u2013 this promising student for the job of governor of the Bank of England. Tucker probably had a similar shock last November, when George Osborne revealed the government's choice to run the Bank of England... Here's some instant reaction to Paul Tucker's decision to quit the Bank of England, having joined it straight from Cambridge University in 1980. (that's because Charlie Bean is also departing) Paul Tucker's resignation letter is online here: His five-year term has been due to finish in February 2014. Paul Tucker's decision to leave the Bank of England comes seven months after he missed out on being promoted to replace Sir Mervyn King as governor. There had been speculation over Tucker's future ever since, with Canada's Mark Carney taking over at the start of next month. Here's the full statement from the Bank of England, announcing that deputy governor Paul Tucker will be clearing his desk, probably this autumn. News Release - Paul Tucker to leave the Bank of England Paul Tucker is today announcing his intention to leave the Bank of England. The exact date of his departure from the Bank will be confirmed in due course, but it is likely to be in the autumn after Paul has provided support to the new Governor,Mark Carney, through the first months of his term of office. Until he leaves the Bank, Paul will also continue to be an active member of the G20\u2019s Financial Stability Board (FSB) and of other international committees. After Paul leaves the Bank, he plans to spend a period of time in academia in the United States. Paul said: \"It has been an extraordinary honour to serve at the Bank of England over the past thirty years. I am very proud that, through the Bank and the wider central banking community, I have been able to make a contribution to monetary and financial stability. I will continue to do so in the coming months. I am looking forward to supporting Mark Carney as he arrives at the Bank.\" Outgoing Governor Sir Mervyn King said: I have been privileged to have had Paul Tucker as a close colleague and Deputy during my time at the Bank and as Governor. Paul\u2019s contribution to the Bank, to monetary policy, and more generally to public policy, both in the UK and in the world as a whole has been enormous. Paul has more to contribute in the future and I am very pleased that he will support my successor, Mark Carney, as he settles into the Bank. Incoming Governor Mark Carney said: It has been an enormous privilege to work closely with Paul at the FSB over the past several years. Paul has contributed immeasurably to a series of critical financial reforms, including policies to end Too-Big-to-Fail and to build more resilient derivative and funding markets. I wish Paul every success in the next phase of his career and look forward to maintaining our close dialogue on how to build a more resilient financial system that more effectively serves the needs of the real economy. Breaking news in the UK: The Bank of England just announced that Paul Tucker, its deputy governor for financial stability, is leaving. That fall in eurozone employment (see last post) just shows the difficulty of returning the region to growth, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. He reckons the European Central Bank could be forced into another interest rate cut this year. Archer writes: The further, and deeper, deeper fall in Eurozone employment in the first quarter of 2013 reinforces belief that consumer spending is likely to remain generally muted in the near term at least, especially as purchasing power is being held down in many countries by muted wage growth and fiscal squeezes. It highlights the fact that the Eurozone continues to face major headwinds and still has its work cut out to return to sustainable growth. Despite improved survey evidence for May, we suspect that the Eurozone will continue to struggle for growth over the coming months. Consequently, we believe there is a strong chance that the ECB will end up taking interest rates down from 0.50% to 0.25% within the next few months. Employment across the eurozone shrank by 0.5% in the first three months of this year, in the latest proof that Europe's labour market continues to deteriorate. Figures released by Eurostat at 10am showed that employment across the eurozone and the EU fell for the seventh quarter in a row. It takes total employment down to the lowest level in seven years: The data also highlighted the sharp differences across the single currency union. Employment rose fastest in the Baltic States: Lithuania (2.4%), Estonia (2.3%) and Latvia (1.0%)... ...and fell most sharply in the periphery: Greece (-2.3%), Portugal (-2.2%) Spain and Cyprus (both -1.3%) and Italy (-1.2%). None of this should shock eurozone watchers. But that first graph shows just how far Europe has fallen during the crisis. Simply emerging from recession later this year (fingers crossed) won't mean a rise in employment -- that peak in early 2008 looks a terribly long way away today. Full Eurostat release here. Europe's stock markets remain mostly up this morning, as this graphic shows: The bond market is also on \"a firmer footing\" at the end of \"tumultuous week\", commented Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities (prices to follow). Ostwald reckons that top officials at the Federal Reserve have been teasing the markets with this talk about slowing their stimulus measures soon: He writes: The suspicion that the FOMC inner circle have been \"floating a balloon\" to see how markets would react, and perhaps to clear out some of the 'frothy' gains in risk assets, looks to be inescapable, and clearly suggests any tapering will be unlikely to commence until Q4, and is likely to be at a 'modest or moderate' (sic) pace. He adds that there's plenty of other factors alarming the financial markets: Indeed, one has to observe that the current bout of turmoil has never been purely dictated by Fed policy concerns, even if they were 'primus inter pares', but also by concerns about the efficacy of Abe-nomics... a renewed focus on the Eurozone's woes and, of course a generalized collection of doubts about the global economy, above all the faltering pace of growth in major developing economies, above all China. But, for now, eurozone bonds are recovering - which means lower borrowing costs (as measured by 10-year bond yields) for its weaker members: \u2022 Spain: down 7 basis points (0.07%) at 4.54% \u2022 Italy: down 9 basis points at 4.27% \u2022 Greece: down 21 basis points at 10% \u2022 Portugal: down 19 basis points at 6.34% Over in Greece, the country's highest court is expected to rule later today on the legality of shutting its state broadcaster, ERT, following a petition brought by ERT's union. Last night, the directors general of 50 European TV and radio broadcasters, including the BBC, urged the government to reverse its decision.There's speculation that the State Council could ask Athens to leave ERT running until it makes a final decision. Meanwhile, Greece's journalists\u2019 union has decided to maintain their strike in support of ERT until next Tuesday (more here). Analysts at Citi have warned that Shinzo Abe needs to produce a rather more impressive package this autumn. Cutting taxes to stimulate growth would be a start. And to prove it's a quiet morning... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone crisis and the global economy. After several dramatic days, there's a real sense of calm across the financial markets this morning. Japan's Nikkei posted a decent-enough rebound overnight, finishing nearly 2% higher, and European markets are bouncing back this morning after four days of losses. The recovery in Japan came after strong US data (jobless numbers and retail sales) yesterday had eased fears over the global economy. But traders were also cheered that Shinzo Abe promised no let-up in in his drive to stimulate economic growth and slay inflation: In a video message released after his cabiet approved his economic plans, Abe declared: The growth strategy decided today will be the starting point. I will ensure political stability and in the autumn I will launch the second round of the Growth Strategy. Those existing measures include ultra-loose monetary policy, more government spending, new special economic zone and incentives to boost private investment. Markets had appeared to lose faith in them this week, as the Nikkei fell and the yen strengthened, but Abe's message is that there is no turning back. Over in Europe this morning, government debt is rallying, bringing down bond yields which had pushed higher through the week. That should ease nerves in the euro periphery. But investers are still jittery about the chances of the Federal Reserve starting to slow its quantitative easing programme soon -- with its Open Market committee (which sets monetary policy) meeting next week. As Kim Soon-young, a market analyst at IBK Securities in Seoul, put it: Sentiment has improved following forecast-beating economic data from the US, but caution still largely rules markets ahead of the FOMC's meeting next week. Otherwise, it's looking like a rather quiet day. Events in Greece could yet dominate attention. The protests sparked by the government's attempt to close its ERT state broadcaster will continue, as prime minister Antonis Samaras tries to hold his coalition together. As usual I'll be watching the latest events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "A volatile week of failed and new bids, banking resignations and fears that central banks would switch off the money taps supporting the markets ended on a calm note. The FTSE 100 finished at 6308.26, up just 3.63 points on the day but down 103 points since Monday's open. One of the week's biggest fallers was Severn Trent, down another 25p on Friday to \u00a317.60 after a proposed \u00a322 a share bid from the LongRiver consortium fell through. LongRiver, comprising Canada's Borealis, a Kuwait sovereign wealth fund and the UK Universities Superannuation Scheme, walked away just before a deadline on Tuesday after failing to persuade the water company to open talks. Severn fell more than \u00a33 over the week to well below the \u00a318.25 level prevailing before the consortium's approach was revealed. Still with takeovers, Vodafone confirmed long standing reports that it was interested in Germany's Kabel Deutschland, allowing it to offer customers television, broadband and fixed line services as well as mobile. After the German group reportedly rejected a \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a36.1bn) approach, Vodafone was said to be preparing to increase its offer, perhaps early next week. Vodafone added 1.35p to 180.05p. Meanwhile Royal Bank of Scotland was on the slide immediately after the surprise resignation of chief executive Stephen Hester, amid concerns of political interference at the state-controlled bank. But following a 3% fall on Thursday it edged up 1p to 316p on Friday. Overall, the week was dominated by growing concerns that central banks would begin withdrawing their financial stimulus packages, which have been designed to boost global economic growth. With central banks pumping an estimated $12trn of extra liquidity into the system since the financial crisis of 2008, the prospect of this ending has unsettled investors, particularly in emerging markets, which have been major beneficiaries of this policy. The Bank of Japan set the tone, disappointing traders by failing to unveil new measures after its meeting on Tuesday.

Political tensions in Greece, where the government made the controversial decision to close state broadcaster ERT, and in Turkey added to the general uncertainty.

    "webTitle": "Deputy governor Paul Tucker quits Bank of England", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England who lost out on the top job to Canadian Mark Carney, announced on Friday that he will leave Threadneedle Street in the autumn, after \"providing support\" to the new governor during his first few months in the post. Tucker was widely expected to step down after failing to secure the governorship, but his five year term was not due to end until next February. In his resignation letter to the chancellor, he said: \"I am immensely proud to have had the opportunity to make a contribution to public policy over the past three decades.\" In his reply, George Osborne, whose decision to headhunt Carney from Canada thwarted Tucker's long-held ambition to lead the Bank of England, said: \"I have no doubt that you will continue to make a towering contribution to the international economic community.\" With another of the Bank's three deputy governors, Charlie Bean, due to leave at the end of June next year, Carney will now be able to put his stamp on the Bank by appointing two of his senior lieutenants within twelve months. Erik Britton, a former Bank economist and now a director of City consultancy Fathom, said: \"The interesting thing is who Carney will want as a successor: it may be that he's a new broom in a number of senses, not only shaking up the old thinking, but shaking out the people who were associated with it.\" But fresh evidence that Carney may face opposition if he wants to push for more economic stimulus came in a speech yesterday from independent monetary policy committee member Ian McCafferty. McCafferty warned that the Bank must guard its reputation carefully, and prevent the public's fears of rising inflation from getting out of control. \"In this environment, I believe it is important to continue to be mindful of the need to keep expectations well-anchored when setting policy,\" he said. According to a statement released by the Bank, Tucker plans to spend some time in US academia, but his name is also likely to be linked with top banking jobs, such as the soon to be vacant chairman's role at Lloyds Banking Group. As deputy governor responsible for financial stability, Tucker has acted as the Bank's eyes and ears in the City. His closeness to the financial sector exposed him to criticism during the Libor-fixing scandal, when he was called before the Treasury select committee to explain his dealings with Barclays boss Bob Diamond. The committee largely exonerated Tucker; but the release of a series of emails, including one in which he referred to Diamond as, \"an absolute brick\", raised questions about his cosy relationship with the City. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chairman of the treasury select committee, said: \"Paul Tucker has done an outstanding job, not least in helping shape the international framework for bank resolution, a vital part of the regulatory response to the crisis.\" The outgoing governor, Sir Mervyn King, said: \"Paul's contribution to the Bank, to monetary policy and more generally to public policy, both in the UK and in the world as a whole, has been enormous.\" Former monetary policy committee member Kate Barker: \"He will be missed; he's done a really good job; he's very devoted to the Bank, and worked tirelessly.\" She added that the 55-year old could yet return to Threadneedle Street. \"I can't see him being in academia for long \u2013 he's young enough not to go from the Bank for ever.\" The new governor has made clear that he will only serve five years of his eight-year term. Simon Wells, UK economist at HSBC and a former Bank economist, said, \"I'm sure a return to public policy is likely.\" Carney, who has worked closely with Tucker at the international Financial Stability Board, which is re-writing global bank regulation, said: \"I wish Paul every success in the next phase of his career and look forward to maintaining our close dialogue on how to build a more resilient financial system that more effectively serves the needs of the real economy.\" Internal candidates to replace Tucker include markets director Paul Fisher, and Andy Haldane, director for financial stability. Haldane has made a series of well-received interventions into public debate since the onset of the financial crisis, but has clashed with Carney over the future of regulation. Who's next? It was the way to bet. Paul Tucker was hot favourite to succeed Sir Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England, but he lost to a younger man. In the circumstances, it was always unlikely that he would hang around to watch Mark Carney perform. The interesting question is who will succeed Tucker as deputy governor for financial stability. One internal candidate towers above others. He is Andrew Haldane, a brainbox who can talk in plain English. But Carney and Haldane have history. The new governor didn't like Haldane's famous \"dog catching a frisbee\" speech (it's all about timing), in which he argued that the new Basel 3 rules on banking are too complex. Since Carney is head of the Financial Stability Board, which set the rules, he was bound to be irritated. Have they made up? We'll find out. Haldane is the best choice. Carney would be a smaller figure if he blocked the appointment.",

Only \u00a359.8m went through the retailer's tills in the week to 8 June, falling below the \u00a360m-a-week mark for the first time since September 2011. Sales were more than 5% down on the same week last year. This was despite the group opening seven new stores and seeing continued record growth in its internet operation \u2013 one of the biggest online success stories for a high street retailer. Andrew Murphy, retail director for the department store chain, described the downturn as a \"blip\", but admitted it was a sign that the record growth for the company was coming to an end. He said: \"The growth that we showed in the last seven months last year was at a level that was unsustainable and no business is going to sustain that in the long term. \"At the moment we have got four shops that are not ahead of their comparative sales from last year, so we would still consider that to be a good position.\" The four stores are Peter Jones in Chelsea, Brent Cross, Stratford and Watford. He added that several key events last year made comparisons difficult, including the diamond jubilee, Olympic and Paralympic Games, and the digital TV switchover in London. \"The jubilee was three times bigger commercially for us than the royal wedding the year before,\" he said. Sales of electricals were dented by \u00a31.2m as TV sales fell as a result of last year's digital switchover \u2013 when the analogue signal was switched off across London and shoppers upgraded their televisions. Sales had been expected to fall in the week to 8 June, compared with a year earlier, because in 2012 there was an extra bank holiday, a later half term and gloomy weather, which all encouraged shoppers into stores. With warm weather finally hitting large swaths of the UK in the first week of June, customers also stayed clear of the high street to enjoy the sunshine, the company said. Peter Ruis, buying and brand director, said: \"Customers really responded to our most weather-dependent ranges with strong results in outdoor living, up 26%, barbecues up 23% and picnicware up 17%.\" However, electricals suffered a 4.6% fall and home fell 8.9% on last year's levels as a result of the high sales of jubilee merchandise in 2012. The retail analyst Nick Bubb agreed that the department store's impressive recent growth could be coming to an end. He said: \"This is probably just a blip for John Lewis, but they aren't singing and dancing quite as much as they were a few months ago. All in all it's getting a bit harder for them and the strong growth appears to be slowing.\" The John Lewis Partnership, which also includes Waitrose, achieved record profits last year, up 15.8% to \u00a3409m, giving employees, or partners, a 17% bonus. Online sales for johnlewis.com soared 40% last year with sales topping \u00a31bn for the first time in the site's history \u2013 a year ahead of schedule.",

      "bodyText": "Workers at hundreds of post offices are set to strike later this month in the latest round of industrial action over plans to franchise out 76 high street branches. The walkout by around 4,000 workers in 373 Crown post offices will be the sixth and seventh strikes since Easter, with staff unhappy at plans by management to sign up outside businesses to run the sites and cut up to 1,500 jobs. The Communications Workers' Union (CWU) said staff would walk out on 20 and 29 June because no progress had been made in discussions with the company over job security. Union bosses have called on the Post Office's chief executive, Paula Vennells, to join the talks in the hope of a resolution.
