Larry writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ryder said: \"Back in 2009 Davos was in trauma. It was in a catatonic state where everything the people here believed in had gone wrong. The mood was that things had to change and there was a lot of high flown rhetoric about the need to tackle inequality and the excesses in financial markets. In 2013, it is back to business as usual to an extent.</p> <p>\"For those here who think we are out of the woods, there are a lot of people out there who are still in the middle of the woods and don't see a way out\".</p> <p>The ILO published its flagship Global Employment Trends earlier this week. it showed that more than 200m around the world were unemployed following a 4m increase in 2012. Two-fifths of the jobless are under 25.</p> <p>Ryder said: \"I am often asked whether the levels of unemployment in southern Europe threaten social stability. Yes, it does. How can 55% youth unemployment not pose a threat. But you don't have to wait for a revolution to do something about it.\"</p> <p>Ryder said Europe was following beggar my neighbour policies, citing the decision by Ford to cut jobs in Belgium and transfer some of the work to Spain, where wages and working conditions have been forced down in response to the debt crisis.</p> <p>\"Unless we get some rules of the game agreed we run the risk of doing competitive damage in Europe\".</p> <p>Ryder said a lack of demand was the main reason the global economy was struggling. \"We need to get money into the economy and into people's pockets. Unfortunately the trends are in the wrong direction.\"</p> <p>Austerity programmes should be reviewed, Ryder said, citing IMF research that showed the impact of public spending cuts and tax increases was greater than previously thought. \"If you discover the medicine is stronger than you thought it makes sense to adjust the dosage\", he said. <strong>LE</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-01-24T09:15:32.165Z\">at 9.15am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5100ed7f95cb5fdbe9eebe04\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-24T08:14:55.515Z\">8.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spanish unemployment hits new high since end of Franco regime</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And there's more misery for Spain, where the unemployment crisis is getting worse.</p> <p><strong>The jobless rate in the final quarter rose to 26.02%, a new high since the end of the Franco dictatorship in the mid 1970s.</strong></p> <p>That compares with 25.02% the previous quarter and is just slightly ahead of expectations of 26%.</p> <p>The national statistics institute said 5.97 million people were unemployed at the end of the fourth quarter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-db883960-4d7e-4c0f-b778-f2b0d1c1a7c7\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/24/1359015054260/f7ba590b-9b56-4fa9-8a39-d52d22a52479-460.jpeg\" alt=\"People wait for the opening of an employment office in Badalona, near Barcelona.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wait for the opening of an employment office in Badalona, near Barcelona.

If so, I'll tweet a picture. Otherwise, we'll be back tomorrow..... Good night! The great and the good of UK business have been chewing the fat at a reception held by the Duke of York tonight. Larry Elliott was there, and reports that George Osborne was in pretty good spirits (so if tomorrow's GDP reading is bad then he's hiding it well). The chatter was that Osborne, David Cameron and Boris Johnson were heading off for a private dinner tonight somewhere in Davos. Eyes peeled! It get better -- we're being treated to a version of Money, Money, Money by ABBA, scored for piano, sax and double-bass. With the global development session over, Davos attendees are now enjoying a spot of food themselves - an oriental-style buffet. The wine is flowing too...(not on this table tho!) GW Unilever's CEO Paul Polman puts his finger on one global imbalance - famine and food waste on the same planet, in the 21st century. One more important line from Ban Ki-moon: The humanitarian community needs $1.5 billion for the next six months -- the largest-ever short-term appeal. However, our appeals to date have been woefully under-funded. That is why I am convening a pledging conference in Kuwait on January 30th. Ban Ki-moon's full statement to Davos is now online - click here to read it. On Syria, he said The situation on the ground is already catastrophic and continues to deteriorate. More than 4 million people are in need of assistance \u2013 a fifth of the country\u2019s population. Nearly 700,000 people have fled the country. Winter and the deepening violence and political stalemate make it likely that these numbers will grow. I commend Syria\u2019s neighbours for hosting these refugees. I urge them to continue to allow those seeking refuge to cross borders to safety, and I urge the international community to support the host countries to avoid unnecessary strain on local communities. And on Mali: The crisis in Mali is deepening. The country is under grave threat from extremist armed insurgents. A toxic mix of poverty, extreme climatic conditions, weak institutions, drug smuggling, and the easy availability of deadly weapons is causing profound misery and dangerous insecurity in and beyond Mali. More than 350,000 Malians have fled their homes. Eighteen million people across the Sahel region are affected by the consequences, including the threat of food shortages. Top-notch panel this. Here's Paul Kagame, Rwanda's president: Bill Gates suggests childhood mortality, and possibly agreeing to try to iradicate extra diseases, as new global development goals: Ban Ki-moon thanks David Cameron for agreeing to head a new top-level panel of world leaders that will address the global development agenda, saying he wants to pay tribute to Cameron's leadership on the issue. It's been a good day for the PM, with several EU leaders singing his tune on the need to improve Europe's competitiveness. Queen Rania of Jordan cites the need to improve education, saying that young people in her country are simply not getting the education they need. With the Millennium Development Goals running out in 2015, the big question for this session is - now what? David Cameron goes first, making five points. 1) lets not waste time between now and 2015 - let's try and hit all the existing goals 2) in the push for something new, let's not kill off the progress made by the existing goals, which have worked well. 3) we must keep the aim to eradicate poverty totally 4) we must listen to poorest people and countries in the world - rather than just having a situation where rich countries are deciding what to do 5) Cameron hopes we can include the \"golden thread\" - those things that take people from poverty to wealth. He cites peace, property rights, honest government This is a top-level panel on the Global Development Outlook, as Davos rounds up the main business of the day by focusing on developing countries and those who need the most help. As well as Ban Ki-moon, we also have David Cameron, Bill Gates, Queen Rania of Jordan, Unilever's Paul Pulman...GW UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has called for world leaders to act now on Syria, in a rather moving and sobering speech at Davos tonight. He called the situation \"catastrophic\", and urged a full ban on arms sales to the country. He also cited Mali as another area where world leaders need to act to stop children being forced to become soldiers, and to We need to stop the death spiral in Syria, and violence in Mali. Yet, the political environment is still polarised European markets have finished for the day, and all in all it's been a fairly positive session. \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished above 6200, closing 1% higher at 6264.91. So far this year, according to FTSE Group, the index has jumped 6.22% \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.53% \u2022 France's Cac has closed 0.7% higher \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is 1.01% better \u2022 Spain's Ibex has added 0.61% \u2022 But in Athens, the market has lost more than 3% \u2022 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.55% and the S&amp;P 500 has passed through the 1,500 barrier for the first time since December 2007, despite an early 9% decline in Apple shares after its disappointing update. NF More on today's unemployment figures from Spain. Giles Tremlett in Madrid writes: The 26.2% unemployment rate marks yet another gruesome record for Spain. Almost 700,000 more people were left without jobs during 2012 - a grim figure that was only beaten in 2009, early in the current crisis, when 1.2m were put out of work. One in ten Spanish homes with people of working age now have no bread-winner. The picture is even worse for those living in the south-western province of Cadiz, which boasts a record-breaking unemployment rate of 40 percent over all age groups. Predictions for this year suggest more jobs will be shed as prime minister Mariano Rajoy's People's party government embraces further austerity and the European Union sets tough budget deficit targets. On Monday the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised down its already grim prediction for this year's recession in Spain, saying it expected the country's economy to shrink by 1.5% in 2013. With both private and public consumption set to slump further, the average end-of-year unemployment rate prediction from analysts is 26.5%. That is especially bad news for the young, with 55% of those under-25 who are not studying already unemployed. In the populous southern region of Andalucia, 65% of under-25s are jobless. Despite the glum predictions for this year, however, the government insists that Spain's recession will bottom out in 2013 - with growth returning at the end of the year or in 2014. Greek transport unions representing employees operating trams, trolleys, trains and buses have announced they will be stepping up their own strike action as an act of solidarity for metro workers, following the government's decision to forcibly mobilise the strikers, writes Helena Smith. Mass protest rallies have also been declared. It puts the sector, which is demanding that EU-IMF-mandated pay cuts be dropped, on a war footing with prime minister Antonis Samaras' government. \"The mobilisation order is tantamount to dictatorship. Let them [the government] come and collect dead bodies. We're not leaving,\" the state-run TV channel ERT has quoted strikers as saying in response to the threat that they will be fired if they refuse to go back to work. The head of union of transport workers, Antonis Stamatopoulos, has just said: \"With its decision the government has proved its inability to reach a solution. Everyone has to assume their responsibilities. We won't leave, others are going to lose their posts.\" The world's oldest bank, Italy's Monte Paschi, could face losses on past derivative trades of as much as \u20ac720m, according to reports. The bank had to ask for \u20ac3.9bn in state aid last year to fill a hole in its balance sheet, but now it has discovered three new trades, which have only just come to light and were negotiated by the previous management. Chief executive Fabrizio Viola, when asked by Il Massaggero newspaper if that was a certain loss said \"the actualised shortfall is around that amount\" (HT Reuters). Italian prime minister Mario Monti said the government was prepared to discuss the case in parliament, and declined to say if the bank would need more state aid. But he said he did not believe the Bank of Italy failed in its oversight of the institution. NF Not everyone seems enamoured of Davos it would appear.... Politicians are pushing central banks too hard to act to promote growth and weaken currencies. That is the view of Jaime Caruana, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, the world's central banking forum. In a Reuters interview at Davos he said we were approaching the point where the damage from central banks printing money \u2013 aka quantitative easing \u2013 could outweigh the benefits. His comments follow the new Tokyo government asking the Bank of Japan to increase asset purchases to help drag the country out of recession. He said: There is always a risk of overburdening central banks. There is perhaps excessive pressure when we discuss... growth. Probably the attention should be focusing on productivity, competitiveness, labour market participation. There is a bit too much focus on central banks. NF And in the UK, there has been speculation that tomorrow's GDP figures could - in contrast to expectations - show a positive reading. The currency might be weakening, but the London market has been given a lift \u2013 the FTSE 100 is currently 66 points or more than 1% higher. NF Away from Davos for a moment, and in the US the S&amp;P 100 has moved above 1,500 for the first time since December 2007. And that despite a 10% fall in constituent member Apple after its disappointing update. NF David Cameron has made universal education for girls his global goal for 2013, as part of the Global Fund's campaign called The Big Push. Some breaking news: The German government has announced that it will contribute \u20ac1bn to the Global Fund over the next five years - which is set up to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. The announcement was made at Davos in the last few minutes, by Dirk Niebel, Germany\u2019s Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development. He said: We need to continue to devote hard work and determined efforts to halting the spread of HIV, malaria and other infectious diseases. We are close to turning the tide. I think we are witnessing the beginning of the end of AIDS. This is an achievement, not least, of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which recently undertook reforms. Effectively, Germany is promising to continue its current policy of handing \u20ac200bn to the Fund per year, from now until 2018. The guarantee of future funds was welcomed by Mark Dybul, executive director of the Global Fund. We can defeat AIDS, TB and malaria...We need funding to get it done. We are at a critical moment for funding, and we need a big push this year. Tony Blair is in Davos, a fact that has driven Brazilian author Paulo Coelho to desperate measures: Coelho is a real twitter star - 6.8 million followers can't be wrong - and has livened up Davos with tweets such as these: And it messes up your sleep patterns too. Anyway, Coelho's stuff is proving popular with the rest of us - he's by far the most retweeted person at Davos today: Finally, Osborne is asked what is more important, growth or deficit reduction. He says: You can't have a succesful economy that people want to invest in, if they think you can't pay your way. Osborne says it is right for the government to back sectors where we have a lead. Everyone is going to want to be flying in planes for the forseeable future. Where are the job opportunities? Osborne says: We are seeing some sectors that are going to be world-beaters. He cites aerospace, pharmaceuticals and creative industry. A lot of Hollywood movies are now being made in Britain. No end in sight for austerity, says Osborne. We're not about to bring that programme [of cuts] to an end. We've set out a programme of deficit reduction until 2017. Says he wants to say to his young children that Britain can be great again. Osborne: An anti-business sentiment would be a bad thing for Britain and any western economy. When it comes to financial services it is perfectly reasonable to say when you make mistakes you have to pay for those mistakes and you can't expect the government is going to come and bail you out. We go out of our way to encourage businesses to move to the UK. I see that the city of London is more than the four or five large domestic banks we have. Osborne: The single market is enormously beneficial, not just to Britain but other countries in the EU. One of the striking things about the British economy. We are very open to foreign investment. To any foreign investor, you know you can come to the UK. London has become the most international city in the world. I think we can demonstrate the kind of flexible, competitive Europe we want to be part of. Secretary-general of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon arrived in Davis by helicopter this morning and went straight into a private meeting on the issue of water scarcity. My colleague Jo Confino has the full story: Five years ago Ban Ki-moon challenged political and business leaders to collaborate to find solutions to the lack of water, which has now been identified by the World Economic Forum as the second most significant risk the world faces. The secretary-general reminded the audience of presidents, business leaders and heads of NGOs that 780 million people lack access to clean drinking water and 2.5 billion lack basic sanitation. He talked of travelling across Africa and seeing long queues at water trucks and the many kilometres women and girls often have to walk to fill up their cans: \u201cThis is quite moving and sad to see what is happening. Water is life; that is what I have been saying all the time. Most of us do not appreciate the water. We just take it for granted.\u201d Moon clearly walks his talk. He keeps only a \u201cvery small bottle of water \u201c in his office so it does not get wasted and is \u201cvery much conscious that I am asking my staff to use water sparingly.\u201d Is there a downside risk of not having the unity of the EU, Osborne is asked? I'm arguing for reforming Europe. I think we can deliver that. What do you think the British people want to see? Britain is a European country, of course we are. But we want the institutions to work for us and our economy. We cooperate in the EU. Cites Britain's logistical support in Mali. On foreign and security matters the leading countries are France and Brtiain, there is a relationship that works very well. We are not however part of the single currency. We are sceptical of the ever greater union we are beings asked to be part of. Osborne: I am relieved [that Britain did not join the euro]. We forget that Tony Blair [then prime minister] wanted to join the euro. A lot of industry bodies, the trade union movement. Those that stood out felt like lone voices. Osborne boasts that Britain is expected to grow more than Germany or France. In terms of progress, the rebalancing is happening, the rate of new company creation is at its highest rate on record. Osborne: We are walking a difficult road but we are heading in the right direction. Jobs are being created. We have still got plenty of difficult decisions to make to keep reforms going. Interviewer asks, slightly incredulously, so you would say this is working? Osborne's response: I would say the rebalancing is taking place. And here's a photo of the Merkel-Cameron chat that took place before the chancellor's speech. He is asked ... how much more pain is there to come? Osborne: A lot of it is now legislated for. The very difficult political arguments have been had. Cites the welfare bill that got through parliament this week. I think we've been able to demonstrate we can do the heavy lifting get the political agreement. I would say there is a broad agreement amongst the public and political system that wherever you make your choices the savings have to be made. As it is happening, jobs are being created in the private sector. Cites the jobs report out this week. Osborne: There is some good evidence that in Britain we are becoming a more competitive economy. Osborne disagrees with interviewer that there is a race to the bottom. I see it as a race to the top of being competitive, an economy where innovation takes place. You can't do that if people question your ability to pay your way in the world. Says he thinks British people understand that. We are aggressively reducing our corproate tax. We have taken a difficult political decision to cut our top rate of tax. We are undertaking all the structural changes that don't yield benefit overnight will transform the competitiveness of Britain to win that global race. Osborne: I don't think it's right to abandon a credible deficit plan. I think the credibility we have, which is evident by the fact I am able to borrow on global markets more cheaply than anyone before me. It would be a huge mistake to put that credibility at risk. Merkel gave her speech (at a rollicking pace) shortly after holding a meeting with David Cameron. The interviewer says Britain's economy is anemic and asks if Osborne will ease austerity, as urged to by the IMF's chief economist (see 9.20am). Osborne says no. Britain still has a high budget deficit. I wish it were not the case. This new government is having to deal with this. We have legislated for, put in place a credible deficit reduction place. He says it is \"flexible\" and that the government has already exercised that flexibility. And with that, Merkel was whisked away... Merkel ended her Q&amp;A session with a plea to businesses to help address Europe's youth unemployment crisis. The German chancellor said she hoped global international companies could bring jobs, peace and hope to young people in Europe. I welcome anyone who will give a helping hand to young people It's always encouraging to hear a European leader talk about the scar of youth unemployment, but clearly it's an issue for politicians at least as much as businesses. As I mentioned earlier, the ITUC is concerned that there is a lack of political leadership on this issue. GW Over to the WEF studio, where George Osborne is set to share \"an insight, an idea\". According to the WEF's streaming service (Osborne's on Channel 3), the studio offers a \"dialogue with inspiring individuals from business, government, academia or civil society who will share the single most important idea that will impact us all\". Another question riffing off Britain's EU referendum - how will Europe draw up new structures such as co-ordinated banking supervision when some members of the EU are refusing to ever join the single currency? Merkel argues that the key is to structure them so that countries who are shunning the euro today could still be included in future. She calls it enhanced co-operation. We should not totally block off the chance in time that other countries will join us in the euro. And with that she's gone, as Graeme notes, she rattled through it... Q&amp;A time, and Merkel is asked about the European Central Bank's unconventional monetary policy. She replies that she hopes the money injected into the system by the ECB (more than \u20ac1tn in cheap loans) is withdrawn soon. But generally, she is complementary - saying the ECB is a very positive force. It will refrain from a policy of manipulation... otherwise we would have problems around the world While Graeme's busy blogging Merkel's speech, we've got some industry reaction to David Cameron's comments earlier today. John Cridland, director general of the CBl, said: Boosting our trade is the single best way of creating jobs, promoting investment and stimulating growth in the UK. Working within the EU we need to push for major trade deals, particularly with the US, and eliminate the tariffs and harmonise the regulation which too often hold businesses back. On tax, Cridland said: The majority of businesses pay the right amount of tax, and for the small minority which do not, times are getting tougher, and rightly so. The CBI does not condone highly abusive avoidance schemes which serve no commercial purpose other than the minimisation of tax, even if they are legal. In some cases the tax system is lagging behind commercial reality, particularly around the taxation of the digital economy and transfer pricing. As the prime minister highlights, the UK needs to work together with other countries, including the G8, to change the rules where appropriate, so that they are fit for the global business age. On a defensive note, Merkel hit back at criticism leveled at Germany for its hard line on EU competitiveness. There's no alternative she insists: Were we to meet halfway, we would have accepted that Europe will not be competitive globally, and that Germany could not compete and export. Merkel moves on to the issue of competitiveness, namechecking David Cameron and his own comments on this issue. She offers the UK PM some support, but insists we should not just worry about whether investors and hedge funds have trust in us. We on a European level want to be as competitive as possible to ensure the prosperity of our people. Merkel adds that we are \"not yet where we want to be\". On trade, the German chancellor says she hopes for a bilateral trade deal with the US, after decades of talks and hitches. UPDATE: And on tax \u2013 Merkel agreed with Cameron that leaders must do more on evasion and avoidance. Quite positive stuff. Rattling through her speech, Merkel points to Europe's competitiveness pact, where countries enter an agreement with the EC to improve areas of their economy when they're not up to scratch. Merkel says Europe is making progress - the amount of new debt being issued has halved -- but the structural reforms under way will take time to deliver results. She points to the Spanish unemployment crisis, where youth unemployment is around 60%, and suggests 'bridging measures' may be needed in some places, so that structural reforms can be made \"without unduly affecting domestic peace\". Bottom line from Merkel - we need to implement painful reforms now, to enjoy the benefits in future. GW And we're off. Angela Merkel says she's very pleased to accept the invitation to Davos, at a time when global economic growth is modest. And she concedes that the eurozone crisis must take some of the blame: I am well aware that the situation in the eurozone and the European as a whole, but particularly the eurozone, has contributed to this modest growth The next order of business is Angela Merkel's special address to Davos, scheduled to begin shortly. Will she include a reference to the UK referendum? The main Hall is filling up, but there's not the crush we saw for David Cameron -- many delegates will be at power lunches or other sessions. GW Here comes Angela Merkel, due on stage in a few minutes. My colleague Graeme Wearden is in the room and ready to live blog all the action, and the WEF will stream her speech here. Away from Davos, our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, says the eight-day strike by metro workers is coming to a head after the government issued an order for them to go back to work. She writes: Striking metro workers have been forced back to work following an emergency meeting of government ministers designed to end a strike that has brought Athens to virtual standstill. The development and transport minister announced the step, which is seen as very draconian, as those who resist going back to work will be automatically fired. In Brussels there has been an air of calm after it appeared that the crisis was over, but unrest in Greece could wreck that idea. Indonesia's trade minister Gita Wirjawan gave a hopeful perspective on China from an economic and political point of view. He said: \"In China, if one guy wants a road built, it gets done.\" In other countries, multiple decision-makers would need to approve. But the advantage will be short-lived, despite the best efforts of the Chinese leaders: \"As countries get a taste for wealth, they get more democratic.\" PI The ITUC's Sharan Burrow also pointed to the huge sums of money locked up in offshore tax havens that could be used to drive growth \u2013 $21tn worth, she says. A topical issue, with David Cameron pledging this morning to make tax avoidance a key target of his G20 presidency. Now he has to deliver, Burrow pointed out: He can do something about it. As a government leader, he's the one who can ensure that people are prosecuted. Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, is at Davos with a mission to persuade politicians and business leaders to do more to combat unemployment. It's a struggle, she tells me: It's been \"Play it again, Sam\" - we've been hearing the same things for the last five years. There's a real lack of leadership within government. The ITUC is pushing issues such as targeted infrastructure spending and apprentice schemes, particularly those with environmental benefits, and held a session on it this morning: The ITUC wants every G20 country to have a formal 'jobs plan' - a programme specifically to reduce unemployment, having seen the jobless rate rise steadily higher in the eurozone. Instead, Burrow said, financial issues dominate the attention, with leaders: ...waking up and worrying about stock markets and rating agencies, rather than things people really care about - such as education, growth and jobs. GW Just grabbed a word with Roland Rudd, the PR magnate, in the Davos Congress Centre, after the eurozone leaders session (see 10.18am onwards). Here's what he said about the issue of the UK referendum: We've just had four leaders - the prime ministers of Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland, all say, and I totally agree, that putting liberalisation and competitiveness at the heart of Europe is absolutely the right thing, and David Cameron should be congratulated for that. However... The problem with a referendum, though, is that it becomes all about the person who is asking about it at the time and not the question itself. It's a big, big risk. GW Back in Ireland, our correspondent Henry McDonald reports that clean and not so clean energy may be about to give the recession stricken Irish economy a double shot in the arm. Irish oil exploration company Providence Resources has announced today that has discovered more oil off the island - this time near Rathlin Island off the Northern Ireland coast. Providence Resources said that the area could be drilled from an onshore location, with high level potential surface well locations currently being evaluated. The company is currently leading a major drilling programme on a number of exploration/development wells at offshore Ireland. Costing around $500m, the multi-year drilling investigation is taking place across six different basins. Providence Resources say it is the largest drilling campaign ever carried out offshore of the island of Ireland. The Rathlin Basin has always been considered an area for oil exploration due to the presence of a rich oil prone source rock, however poor seismic imaging has historically rendered it difficult to determine the basin's true hydrocarbon entrapment potential. The planned drilling operation off north Antrim forms part of Providence's ongoing multi-basin drilling programme which began last year, with the successful appraisal of the Barryroe oil field, due south of Cork in the Celtic Sea. Meanwhile, Irish and British ministers signed a deal today which will allow Ireland to sell wind turbine energy to the UK. The deal means that 40 clusters of wind turbines located in the bog lands of the Irish Midlands, with the machines at more than 600 feet in the air, will generate energy for millions of UK homes from 2017. One of the wind turbine developers, Element Power, has claimed the plan would save UK consumers around \u00a37bn over 15 years compared to other renewable sources. The power generated would be transferred to the UK via undersea cables beneath the Irish Sea that would join the national grid at two points in Wales. And so for a quick pre-lunch round-up. \u2022 David Cameron used his speech at Davos to attack companies that avoid paying their fair share of tax. (9.36am onwards and full-story here) \u2022 The IMF's chief economist said Britain should tone down its austerity plans to help the struggling economy. (9.20am, analysis from Larry Elliott here) \u2022 Spanish youth unemployment has hit 60% (8.14am and 8.48am) \u2022 Dutch PM Mark Rutte said it should be possible for countries to leave the eurozone. (10.39am) David Cameron said trade, tax and transparency would be the three themes of Britain's presidency of the G8 this year, report Larry Elliott and Heather Stewart from Davos. They write: Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the prime minister strongly attacked companies that avoid paying their fair share of tax and which indulge in corrupt business practices in poor countries. Cameron said aggressive tax avoidance meant fewer resources for public services and delivered a sideswipe at the coffee giant Starbucks, which has been under attack since revealing it pays little corporation tax in the UK. \"Companies need to wake up and smell the coffee, because the customers who buy from them have had enough\", the prime minister said. Meanwhile, ITV's Laura Kuenssberg says Starbucks has still not agreed on a way to pay its tax in the UK. Labour has jumped on comments by the IMF's chief economist that Britain should ease off on austerity (see 9.20am). Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: David Cameron and George Osborne must finally heed the IMF\u2019s advice. They have repeatedly warned that a change of course would be needed in Britain if the economy turns out worse than expected. After two and a half years of flatlining and a double-dip recession the IMF is now clearly losing patience. For many months we have called for urgent action to kick-start our economy. The IMF has said such a plan B should include policies Labour has long called for \u2013 including temporary tax cuts, such as a VAT reduction, and bringing forward long-term infrastructure investment. The longer the Government clings on to its failing plan, the more long-term damage they will do to our economy. David Cameron and George Osborne must now put political pride aside and put the national economic interest first. Fox News asks for tips from Monti and Kenny for US congress on making spending cuts. Monti: It was a cross-partisan effort [in Italy]. He boasts that the US Congress should study their budget cuts and multi-party effort. Kenny: It's very important the first thing that should be laid out ... what do you want over the period of government? There is a constant explanation to people about how you intend to get there. The US also needs to look at its global position. Monti wants to applaud the clarity of the promised referendum in Britain. It is important whenever a people are asked a quesiton about the EU that the question be the full question. Do they wish to be members of the EU or not? He thinks Britain will say yes. Barber asks: do you believe the changes which will be agreed to secure the eurozone will require a treaty change? Monti: No. Kenny: Not now. T-S: No. Rutte: Not in the immediate future. In the medium term we will need it to deal with the fundamental design flaws in the eurozone. Danish PM now: If we keep borrowing we are stealing from future generations. She too wants to return to the discussion Cameron started yesterday. It is a perfectly legitimate discussion. We might not agree on the path but it is legitimate. There are questions to be asked on how we run Europe. Every morning we need to wake up and ask are we spending public money in the right way. Rutte: We need a debate on what tasks should be done at EU level and what at a national level. Britain outside the EU would be an island in the middle of the ocean somewhere between Europe and the US. I don't agree with specific opt-outs for just one country, agreements should be reached at the level of 27. Barber says he would say that, because Ireland, with its low rate of tax, would not want a change to any tax laws. Kenny: Our tax is 12.5%. Ireland is not a haven for unorthodox tax avoidance. Our tax regime is a national competence and it's not changing. Rutte and Kenny have been asked about the repatriation of powers. What are the possibilities, would you like to repatriate powers? Kenny: There's a measure here of what it is Europe wants to do in the time ahead. My priority and the priority of Europe now should be to deal with the consequences of our current crisis. Just because there is no talk of the euro failing doesn't mean there should be any complacency. I'm not concerned now about repatriation of powers. We can talk about all of these issues in the context of future treaty change if and when that arises. Barber now asking Monti about unemployment. What would you single out to offer some hope to young people who don't have jobs? Monti: Specific measures for youth. Even this outgoing government was able to begin awarding some tax relief for companies hiring youth. Much more can be done with a five-year perspective. Second, labour market reform. Our labour market reform did not go far enough. One of the unions was considerably resistant to change. We need to change that culture. The idea that I would promote should I be in a position to do is to unite those pro-reform forces so that there is more energy behind the reforms, including in the labour market. (Italy obviously has its elections coming up where Monti has teamed up with frontrunner Bersani to try and keep Berlusconi out of power.) Kenny: There is a new sense of realism in Europe. What we need now is the mandate to start the negotiations for free trade between the EU and US. But he says it's not likely to be agreed this year or next. Barber asking him on the possibliity of agreeing transatlantic free trade area in 2013-14. Rutte and Monti both think it is possible. On Britain, Rutte says: We need Britain not only to stay in the EU but to be very active in it. Now on to the Dutch PM, Mark Rutte. Barber asking him if all countries are agreed that the eurozone will stay intact. Rutte applauds Italy and Ireland's efforts. Both have done the necessary to get fiscal discipline. Rutte: Our aim should be to keep eurozone intact. You can never predict when a country wants to leave the eurozone. It should be possible. T-S: Countries like Denmark, we know there is an open door for non-euro countries to join in discussions over things like the fiscal compact. Now we are discussing a banking union. We will have a vivid debate in my country whether we will join this banking union. Barber asking would you be better off in the eurozone, or are you better off outside? T-S: I've always been in favour of Denmark joining the euro and I still am. T-S says that in Denmark they have adopted a very tight budget. It is not easy to run a tight budget but it is necessary. Says Denmark has become a safe haven. T-S: We have reformed the tax system, early retirement, benefits, schooling. This is necessary to preserve the well-developed welfare state we want to have. My mistake, this is definitely not Polish PM Donald Tusk. It is Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schidt! T-S: What we need to do in the coming years is we need to change in a structural way to maintain what we like so much about Europe. To change but still keeping what we feel is our core values. Barber asks Kenny for advice on how to win a referendum (on behalf of David Cameron). Kenny: People in our country understand Europe. We have strategic partnerships signed with Britain. They are our biggest trading partner. Britain were a driving force for the single market. I would argue that many of the issues that arise for politicians, these are things you can change from inside. I would like to see the digital market become truly single. I would like to see that Britain would remain central to the EU. It's very important for a global sense. Kenny: Ireland voted 60/40 in favour of the euro. That is where we see our future. Kenny says, looking over at Dutch PM Rutte: I would like to say that it's important in terms of international reputation for contributor countries to understand their money is not wasted. Kenny: We expect to exit our [bailout] programme in 2013. But we can't do it without EU support. Now Irish prime minister Enda Kenny. FT editor Lionel Barber is asking him about the measures Ireland has taken to reform its banking system. Kenny: It's been a hurricane. There was a complete sense of despair and disillusionment [when he came into power]. You can watch the session live on the WEF's streaming service. Monti: No individual country in Europe can keep or resume a momentum for growth unless EU policies are focused on growth. Right, next up in Davos is a panel with Italian prime minister Mario Monti, Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny, Dutch PM Mark Rutte and Polish PM Donald Tusk to discuss the eurozone crisis. Another question from the floor - and it falls to Stephanie Flanders of the BBC. \"Ah, right\", grunts Cameron. Flanders asks the PM how he can be a great salesman for Britain if he's telling companies that if they invest in the UK they will face years of uncertainty over our place in Europe, and huge pressure to pay more taxes. Cameron argues (again) that Britain shouldn't sit on the sidelines while Europe reshapes itself: Much better to get in there to lead the debate and get a more open and flexible leader, and put it to the country And on tax, the PM's pitch is: We will cut our taxes, we will be competitive...but in return we do ask that people pay their fair share. GW There's no escape from the issue of Brexit \u2013 with a member of the Hinduja family asking about the implications of Cameron's EU referendum plan. Cameron defends the plan \u2013 saying he's proposing change for Europe as well as the UK. Q&amp;A time. Barbara Stocking, Oxfam's outgoing CEO, welcomes Cameron's comments on transparency \u2013 but says she want to push him a little harder on it. She cites the scramble for land in the developing world, where foreign companies are snapping up valuable resources. Cameron agrees that simply talking about transparency isn't enough. Transparency, a clampdown on tax ... isn't it all a bit right-on and anti-business, prime minister? No, Cameron insists. It's in everyone's interest. A company avoiding tax means fewer resources to fund public services. Co-ordinated evasion hits everyone. That's why it's not just been NGOs lobbying me on this, Cameron adds, those from the top echelons of the City have been pushing this issue too. GW Cameron: I'm as pro-business a leader as you can find. On transparency, Cameron says the G8 must crack down on developing countries who are concealing assets or syphoning off profits. He points to an $800m gap in Nigeria's oil accounts. GW Describing himself as a low-tax conservative, not a no-tax conservative, David Cameron is arguing that the tax avoidance problem is now so serious that it needs to be addressed. Companies are using armies of lawyers to find loopholes to cut their tax bills \u2013 it's an issue whose time has come. He also takes a pop at Starbucks over its tax planning: Companies need to wake up and smell the coffee, because the customers who buy from them have had enough. David Cameron is rattling through the problems endemic in the world economy, saying the world needs to reform \"Trade, tax, transparency\" On trade deals, the PM is pointing to potential free trade deals that are on the table but not signed. On tax, he cites companies who use \"clever accountants\" to legally avoid tax. On transparency, he slams countries - such as in Africa - who: rip off hard working people and plunder natural resources... Government officials get rich, some beyond their wildest dreams of avarice. On economics, Cameron tells Davos that leaders must tackle their debts, cut business taxes, and slash \"bloated\" welfare states. We're doing all that in Britain, he says. And on Europe - the PM insists he's not turning his back on Europe - \"far from it\"., before reprising his argument that Britain must reshape its relationship with Europe - to benefit both sides. GW David Cameron begins by outlining his priorities as G8 president, and the top priority is terrorism. Following the attacks in Algeria last week, the UK PM says the world faces a long struggle against terrorism and the poisonous ideology driving it. (corrected). We must be tough, we must be intelligent, and we must be patient And military action has a place, says Cameron, citing the French action in Mali. GW Here's a link to where you can watch David Cameron's speech, which is starting now Over in Davos, my colleague Graeme Wearden is gearing up for David Cameron's speech. He'll be live blogging the speech here. We're now hearing on Twitter that the French president's office has denied earlier reports that it is scrapping the 75% tax plan (see 7.58am). CNBC's France and Spain correspondent says: Kissinger on Europe: the skills used to develop economic union should be transferred to developing political union. He also jokes that when he discusses Europe, he includes the UK.... ..which sets up our next speaker, David Cameron. GW Britain should tone down its austerity plans to help the struggling economy, the International Monetary Fund's chief economist has said. Olivier Blanchard said the budget in March would be a good time for George Osborne to \"take stock\" of his plan A. The comments, in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, came after the IMF trimmed its forecasts for the UK and global growth. The British economy is now expected to expand by 1% rather than 1.1% this year, and 1.9% rather than 2.2% next year. Australia's foreign minister Bob Carr kindly provides a photo of Kissinger in action: More from Kissinger on Iran: Unilateral intervention by Israel would be a desperate last resort, but the Iranians have to understand that if they keep using the negotiations to gain time to complete a nuclear program then the situation will become extremely dangerous. The consequences of an Iranian nuclear programme is that other countries in the area will also want nuclear weapons: The danger is that nuclear weapons become almost conventional, and we face a nuclear war at some point...that would be a turning point in world history. GW After gloomy signs from France and surprisingly good data from Germany (see below), it wasn't clear how the composite eurozone business survey would look. But it seems the eurozone may have turned a corner, according to the latest purchasing managers' index. Markit's PMI for the eurozone, which surveys around 5,000 firms and is seen as a good growth indicator (according to Reuters), showed the rate of decline in the region's private sector eased more than expected. The PMI for January jumped to 48.2 from 47.2 in December, beating expectations of 47.5. But it remains below the 50 mark, which separates expansion from contraction. Chris Williamson of Markit says: We shouldn't get too gloomy about those numbers. There is a turning point that took place towards the end of last year and the beginning of this year so things are picking up. Any downturn is looking likely to end in the first half. JM Can Barack Obama drive progress in the Middle East? Henry Kissinger (a former Republican secretary of state) admits that the president \"wasn't my first choice\" in the last election, but is hopeful \u2013 with Iran clearly high on his agenda. Australia's foreign minister also believes Obama must get his hands dirty in the Middle East. GW And on Israel and Palestine, Kissinger says that a workable solution would require 'significant sacrifice from Israel from what they already hold', but that Arabs must offer 'more recipricity than just uttering peace'. GW And, lest we forget our American friends amid all this European excitement, overnight the US House of Representatives voted to extend the country's borrowing limit for more than three months, as the majority of Republicans backed down from their demands for more spending cuts. Our US business correspondent Dominic Rushe reports: The Republican-sponsored bill still needs a Senate vote and presidential approval but is likely to receive both. Democrats said they would approve the bill without changes shortly before the vote, which passed 285-144 with 86 Democrats voting for the bill to make up for the 33 Republicans who objected. John Boehner, Republican House speaker, included a provision in the bill that will halt Washington lawmakers' wages if a budget plan is not passed by April 15. \"It's real simple: no budget, no pay,\" said Boehner. Kissinger moves on to Syria, where he says the world faces a huge human tragedy if it stands on the sidelines and does not intervene. But if it does intervene it will be in middle of vast ethnic conflict. His solution \u2013 a joint US-Russian agreement which other countries wold also back (just to be clear, that wouldn't be a military intervention) GW Taking a closer look at Spain's dismal unemployment data, it seems youth unemployment has hit 60%. And analysts say the problem will only get worse. Citigroup strategist Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez told Reuters: We haven't seen the bottom yet and employment will continue falling in the first quarter. JM The first set-piece session is underway - Dr Henry Kissinger is being interviewed by Davos founder Klaus Schwab. Opening question - the situation in the Middle East in the aftermath of the Arab Spring. Kissinger harks back almost a century: The Middle East, for one thing, is a system in which many of the states were artifiically created at the end of the first world war. Composition of these countries were not created by shared history, but for the convenience of the victors of world war one, he adds. Second point: National borders are much more transitory because of the breakdown of religious believes Thirdly, the issue of nuclear proliferation - and Kissinger warns that a nuclear crisis over Iran is close: For 15 years, the permanent members o the Security Council have declare that a nuclear Iran is unacceptable, but it is approaching So in a few years, people will have to come to a determination of how to react, or the consequences of non-reaction. I believe this point will be reached in a very foreseeable future. He also points to Libya, where western powers initially welcomed the uprising but are now finding that every action has consequences. You can't pick some and \"abdicate from the remainder\". GW Germany's manufacturing sector continues to shrink, although activity picked up in Janaury, with the PMI rising from 46 to 48.8. Markit said a return to growth in output boded well for the months ahead. Williamson again: Exports are still acting as a drag, but much less so than they have been in prior months. JM There's better news out of Germany, where the purchasing managers' index shows the private sector expanding at its fastest rate in a year. The Markit composite PMI for Germany came in at 53.6 for Janaury, compared with 50.3 in December. That puts it firmly above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. The services sector did particularly well, with the services PMI jumping to a 19-month high of 55.3 in January, compared with expectations that it would stick at December's level of 52. Chris Williamson at Markit said: Any disappointment in fourth-quarter growth will be the worst we see in the current economic cycle, and the GDP numbers for the first quarter are going to show a rebound. He expects growth of 0.3% at the start of the year, but says there could be \"an even stronger recovery\". JM Boris Johnson is also understood to be lurking in Davos today. The London mayor isn't scheduled to give any speeches, but we're quietly confident that he'll make some headlines ... GW The problems caused by high and rising global unemployment are one of the main themes of this year's Davos. Our economics editor Larry Elliott has been discussing the problem of unemployment with Guy Ryder, director general of the International Labour Organisation, which represents the interests of workers around the world. Among other things, Ryder says the levels of unemployment in southern Europe threaten social stability. Larry writes: Ryder said: \"Back in 2009 Davos was in trauma. It was in a catatonic state where everything the people here believed in had gone wrong. The mood was that things had to change and there was a lot of high flown rhetoric about the need to tackle inequality and the excesses in financial markets. In 2013, it is back to business as usual to an extent. \"For those here who think we are out of the woods, there are a lot of people out there who are still in the middle of the woods and don't see a way out\". The ILO published its flagship Global Employment Trends earlier this week. it showed that more than 200m around the world were unemployed following a 4m increase in 2012. Two-fifths of the jobless are under 25. Ryder said: \"I am often asked whether the levels of unemployment in southern Europe threaten social stability. Yes, it does. How can 55% youth unemployment not pose a threat. But you don't have to wait for a revolution to do something about it.\" Ryder said Europe was following beggar my neighbour policies, citing the decision by Ford to cut jobs in Belgium and transfer some of the work to Spain, where wages and working conditions have been forced down in response to the debt crisis. \"Unless we get some rules of the game agreed we run the risk of doing competitive damage in Europe\". Ryder said a lack of demand was the main reason the global economy was struggling. \"We need to get money into the economy and into people's pockets. Unfortunately the trends are in the wrong direction.\" Austerity programmes should be reviewed, Ryder said, citing IMF research that showed the impact of public spending cuts and tax increases was greater than previously thought. \"If you discover the medicine is stronger than you thought it makes sense to adjust the dosage\", he said. LE And there's more misery for Spain, where the unemployment crisis is getting worse. The jobless rate in the final quarter rose to 26.02%, a new high since the end of the Franco dictatorship in the mid 1970s. That compares with 25.02% the previous quarter and is just slightly ahead of expectations of 26%. The national statistics institute said 5.97 million people were unemployed at the end of the fourth quarter. Ouch. Sticking with France, the country's purchasing managers' survey for January is particularly bad, with business activity shrinking at the fastest rate since the trough of the global financial crisis. That suggests the eurozone's second-biggest economy may be in recession. Markit said its French composite PMI, which covers both manufacturing and services, came in at 42.7 compared with 44.6 in December. Jack Kennedy of Markit said: January's flash PMI data signal a very disappointing start to 2013 and add to concerns that the French economy is sliding towards recession. He expects the economy to have contracted by 0.6% in the fourth quarter and says the downturn across the channel is worsening. JM Over in France, it appears that president Hollande's promise of a 75% tax on income over \u20ac1m is dead in the water. According to Europe 1, the government decided to abandon the plan almost a month after it was rejected by the constitutional council. The president's office said the measure had been abandoned because of its complexity and for political reasons. A government source said (apologies for the clunky translation): We need to show the rich that we don't want to strangle them. For now, the official line is that the famous tax will be discussed in September. JM And a quick look at the agenda for economic releases across the eurozone. There's plenty of data out today, including eurozone purchasing managers' surveys, which should give an indication of the economic health of the region at the start of the first quarter. France PMI (January): 7.58 Spain unemployment (Q4): 8am Germany PMI (January): 8.28am Eurozone PMIs (January): 8.58am ECB eurozone current account (November): 9am Italy retail sales (November): 9am UK BBA mortgage lending (December): 9.30am UK CBI distributive trades (January): 11am US weekly jobless claims: 1.30pm US PMI (January): 1.58pm JM Davos was awake well before dawn this morning, as attendees squeezed in breakfast meetings before the action kicked off in the Congress Hall. The traffic was almost bumper-to-bumper as I scurried in \u2013 partly because of the tight security (several guards are posted outside the main buildings and at junctions). GW Our economics editor Larry Elliott was up bright and early this morning at an HSBC breakfast to discuss whether the Chinese renminbi will be the next global reserve currency. He writes: Stephen King HSBC chief economist says China may be the world's second biggest economy but in terms of its financial clout it is a \"relative minnow\". \"But if we went back 100 years and spoke to the typical UK investor he would have raised doubts about whether the dollar would be the reserve currency of the world\". Barry Eichengreen, economics professor at the University of California said the yuan would eventually become a reserve currency but the internationalisation of the Chinese currency was in its \"fairly early stages\". The dollar accounts for 65% of global reserves. Eichengreen said that was because of a lack of alternatives. \"The simple absence of alternatives works in the dollar's favour. It won't last for ever but it is a factor right now. The dollar has safe haven status even when we in the US have caused the bad things\". Eichengreen said he didn't see a threat from rising US debt. Here's an agenda: \u2022 9.30am CET (8.30am GMT): Henry Kissinger speaks on \u201cThe state of the world\u201d \u2022 10.30am CET: David Cameron gives a \"special address\" \u2022 11am CET: Enda Kenny, Mario Monti, Mark Rutte and Donald Tusk discuss the eurozone crisis \u2022 2.15pm CET: Angela Merkel gives a \"special address\" \u2022 2.45pm: George Osborne discusses an \"economic insight\" (your guess is as good as ours!) \u2022 4.30pm: Panel discussion on preventing a lost generation \u2022 6pm: Ban Ki-Moon, David Cameron, Bill Gates, Helen D Gayle, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Paul Polman and Queen Rania of Jordan discuss the Global Economic Outlook Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of the second day of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting. It's a BIG day in Davos. In the next few hours David Cameron, Angela Merkel, George Osborne and Henry Kissinger will be speaking \u2013 discussing the state of the global economy and giving their visions of the future. And behind the scenes, some of the richest and most powerful people in the world will be holding private meetings. We'll be covering the event live \u2013 along with our colleagues Larry Elliott and Heather Stewart, the Guardian and Observer economics editors. As with yesterday, we'll use our initials at the end of each post to show who wrote what.",

In an update to investors, Einhorn said: </p> <blockquote> We have also increased our Vodafone holdings, as the stock fell sharply on news that just doesn't seem that bad. After achieving an August peak of 192p, the shares ended the year at 154p. At this valuation, it appears that the market is placing no value on Vodafone's 45% stake in [US joint venture] Verizon Wireless. And the Verizon Wireless stake is clearly quite valuable. <br> Given the huge valuation disparity between what the market thinks Verizon Wireless is worth to Verizon (at least a couple hundred billion dollars) and what it ascribes to Vodafone (about zero), combined with Verizon's increasing dependence on Verizon Wireless, it wouldn't surprise us if Verizon decided to buy all of Vodafone to gain full ownership of Verizon Wireless. It could decide to become a global telecom leader or it could spin out parts of Vodafone that it's not interested in owning. Maybe there is an investment banker with time on their hands reading this letter. </blockquote> <p>Ahead of Vodafone's third quarter update on 7 February, analysts at Espirito Santo said Vodafone had circulated consensus forecasts before the statement. They said:</p> <blockquote> We are in line with consensus for organic service revenue growth where we expect a decline of 2.4% year on year. A decline of this magnitude would represent a deterioration on the 1.4% decline last quarter. Southern Europe is expected to remain a drag with particular weakness in Spain and Italy <br> Our expectation of a slowdown in growth for the consolidated operations is in contrast to the acceleration in growth reported by [US joint venture] Verizon Wireless on Tuesday. Potential upgrades stemming from the better than expected growth at Verizon Wireless may well be tempered by the poor growth within the European operations. </blockquote> <p>At the same time, Goldman Sachs issued a buy note, saying there was potential for Vodafone to acquire cable company assets:</p> <blockquote> We lower our medium-term growth expectations for Vodafone given longlasting structural pressures in Europe. However, we retain our buy rating as we believe Vodafone has attractive potential to materially improve its structural position by acquiring cable assets, and realizing substantial potential synergies. We analyse this potential - our scenario analysis suggests that selling a portion of its stake in Verizon Wireless to fund cable acquisitions would be accretive to long-term value with cautious execution assumptions. </blockquote> <p>Vodafone's rise helped lift the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> by 67.27 points to 6264.91, its highest level since 19 May 2008. The rise accelerated on talk that Friday's UK GDP figure could be positive, contrary to most expectations.</p> <p>Meanwhile in the US, the S&amp;P 500 breached the 1,500 barrier for the first time since December 2007 despite an early 9% fall in Apple shares after its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/jan/24/apple-results-iphone-sales\" title=\"\">disappointing results</a>.</p> <p>The iPhone maker's weakness initially hit shares in UK chipmakers and component suppliers who count the US technology group as a key customer.</p> <p><strong>Arm </strong>fell as low as 832p but ended the day 18p higher at 867.5p as analysts said it would benefit from increasing demand for tablets, despite Apple's problems. But others were not so lucky. <strong>Imagination Technologies</strong> dropped 7p to 457.1p and <strong>Laird</strong> lost 8.2p to 223.4p.</p> <p>Miners were in demand, benefiting from encouraging factory figures from China, now one of the world's key commodity consumers.</p> <p><strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rose 74p to \u00a335.75 while <strong>Anglo American</strong> added 25.5p to 1894.5p.</p> <p>Chemicals group <strong>Croda International</strong> climbed 79p to \u00a324.37 after a positive note from JP Morgan:</p> <blockquote> Helped by a robust end to 2012, we believe, as softness in September should have been recovered through the final quarter \u2013 along with the likelihood of a good start in the seasonally strong January - Croda is likely to appeal to investors as confidence returns in a continuation of the steady growth profile. Ongoing good demand and high margins in consumer care, and progress in performance technologies, should ensure a continuation of the success story of recent years. In addition, 2013 should see the absence of a currency negative seen in 2012 allowing a good comparative base \u2013 as more cyclical chemical companies suffer volume and pricing pressure. <br> </blockquote> <p>Among the mid caps defence group <strong>Chemring</strong> has climbed 17.1p to 299.6p following its final results. These showed a 42% drop in earnings in a year of numerous profit warnings, failed takeover talks and management changes. The company, which makes flares and explosive device detectors, said profits had fallen from \u00a3120.2m to \u00a370.1m and said defence spending in the US, UK and Europe remained under pressure. It will simplify its structure, and give priority to cost and cash management. In a buy note, Investec said:</p> <blockquote> Chemring's 2012 results are in line with our revised expectations, which counts as a positive given the recent history. We make only minor positive adjustments to our forecasts, consistent with the board's guidance, given the uncertainty and early stages of the turnaround plan. However, the results provide reassurance that group profitability can start to be recovered despite challenging end markets. Our new price target of 335p equates to 12.4 times 2014 earnings per share, undemanding given potential upside to earnings. </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Gold Oil</strong> lost 1.44p to 1.54p after the company's shares returned from a suspension imposed in June last year.

Southern Europe is expected to remain a drag with particular weakness in Spain and Italy Our expectation of a slowdown in growth for the consolidated operations is in contrast to the acceleration in growth reported by [US joint venture] Verizon Wireless on Tuesday. Potential upgrades stemming from the better than expected growth at Verizon Wireless may well be tempered by the poor growth within the European operations. At the same time, Goldman Sachs issued a buy note, saying there was potential for Vodafone to acquire cable company assets: We lower our medium-term growth expectations for Vodafone given longlasting structural pressures in Europe. However, we retain our buy rating as we believe Vodafone has attractive potential to materially improve its structural position by acquiring cable assets, and realizing substantial potential synergies. We analyse this potential - our scenario analysis suggests that selling a portion of its stake in Verizon Wireless to fund cable acquisitions would be accretive to long-term value with cautious execution assumptions. Vodafone's rise helped lift the FTSE 100 by 67.27 points to 6264.91, its highest level since 19 May 2008. The rise accelerated on talk that Friday's UK GDP figure could be positive, contrary to most expectations. Meanwhile in the US, the S&amp;P 500 breached the 1,500 barrier for the first time since December 2007 despite an early 9% fall in Apple shares after its disappointing results. The iPhone maker's weakness initially hit shares in UK chipmakers and component suppliers who count the US technology group as a key customer. Arm fell as low as 832p but ended the day 18p higher at 867.5p as analysts said it would benefit from increasing demand for tablets, despite Apple's problems. But others were not so lucky. Imagination Technologies dropped 7p to 457.1p and Laird lost 8.2p to 223.4p. Miners were in demand, benefiting from encouraging factory figures from China, now one of the world's key commodity consumers. Rio Tinto rose 74p to \u00a335.75 while Anglo American added 25.5p to 1894.5p. Chemicals group Croda International climbed 79p to \u00a324.37 after a positive note from JP Morgan: Helped by a robust end to 2012, we believe, as softness in September should have been recovered through the final quarter \u2013 along with the likelihood of a good start in the seasonally strong January - Croda is likely to appeal to investors as confidence returns in a continuation of the steady growth profile. Ongoing good demand and high margins in consumer care, and progress in performance technologies, should ensure a continuation of the success story of recent years. In addition, 2013 should see the absence of a currency negative seen in 2012 allowing a good comparative base \u2013 as more cyclical chemical companies suffer volume and pricing pressure. Among the mid caps defence group Chemring has climbed 17.1p to 299.6p following its final results. These showed a 42% drop in earnings in a year of numerous profit warnings, failed takeover talks and management changes. The company, which makes flares and explosive device detectors, said profits had fallen from \u00a3120.2m to \u00a370.1m and said defence spending in the US, UK and Europe remained under pressure. It will simplify its structure, and give priority to cost and cash management. In a buy note, Investec said: Chemring's 2012 results are in line with our revised expectations, which counts as a positive given the recent history. We make only minor positive adjustments to our forecasts, consistent with the board's guidance, given the uncertainty and early stages of the turnaround plan. However, the results provide reassurance that group profitability can start to be recovered despite challenging end markets. Our new price target of 335p equates to 12.4 times 2014 earnings per share, undemanding given potential upside to earnings. Lower down the market Gold Oil lost 1.44p to 1.54p after the company's shares returned from a suspension imposed in June last year. It said it had made progress on plans to raise further capital, and expected to make more director appointments.",

He wants to harness public fury against tax dodgers at home, to fight for fairer international rules that force businesses to pay their way.

Emerging economies that have watched the west implode in the financial crisis are reluctant to listen to lecturing from the G8; aid budgets are under pressure, with Britain one of the few countries living up to its G8 promises; and the growing importance of the G20 \u2013 which also includes the major developing countries \u2013 has left the G8 looking like a political relic. That's why Cameron has enthusiastically grasped the idea that alleviating poverty is not just about aid. He wants to harness public fury against tax dodgers at home, to fight for fairer international rules that force businesses to pay their way. Christian Aid estimates that companies dodge $160bn of corporation tax each year \u2013 enough, it says, to alleviate hunger for 75,000 children. The prime minister is also calling for more transparency about who owns what \u2013 to prevent secretive land-grabs in Africa and allow campaigners to fight for a fair share of natural resources, for example \u2013 and a renewed push to tear down trade barriers. All of this goes with the grain of an economically liberal Tory party that is sceptical about the benefits of overseas aid (though Cameron is not abandoning his aid promises), but cherishes the idea of playing by the rules. It helps avoid the risk that African governments feel excluded and talked down to by the dinosaurs in the G8: Cameron's message, instead, will be \"we'll start by getting our house in order\". And, like Make Poverty History in the runup to the 2005 G8, it has been carefully choreographed to chime with a noisy grassroots campaign from a coalition of NGOs, which argues that there is enough food to feed the world, if only we make the global system work better. It remains to be seen how much political muscle Britain's prepared to put behind the prime minister's rhetoric. But if Cameron achieved even one of his goals \u2013 forcing firms to pay their fair share of tax in each country in which they operate \u2013 Britain's G8 chairmanship would be something to celebrate.",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron has said trade, tax and transparency will be the three themes of Britain's presidency of the G8 this year. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the prime minister strongly attacked companies that avoid paying their fair share of tax and which indulge in corrupt business practices in poor countries. Cameron said aggressive tax avoidance meant fewer resources for public services and delivered a sideswipe at the coffee giant Starbucks, which has been under attack since revealing it pays little corporation tax in the UK. \"Companies need to wake up and smell the coffee, because the customers who buy from them have had enough,\" the prime minister said. Cameron used his speech to lay out his agenda for the G8 summit, which will be held in Northern Ireland in June. The leading western nations needed to work together to tackle the threat of extremism and terrorist violence, he said. Following last week's attack in Algeria, Cameron said: \"We are in the midst of a long struggle against murderous terrorists and the poisonous ideology that supports them.\" Winning the battle would require the leaders of the developed world to be \"tough, intelligent and patient\". Military action would sometimes be needed, but the west also had to deal with the underlying grievances that caused terrorism, he said. Britain last held the G8 in 2005, when Tony Blair put aid, trade and debt relief high on the agenda at the Gleneagles summit. Cameron said there was still unfinished business on trade and called for the completion of a free trade deal between the European Union and the US which he said could add \u00a350bn to Europe's economy. Seeking to reassure the business leaders gathered in Davos that his focus on tax did not mean he was anti-capitalist, he said: \"I'm as pro-business a leader as you can find.\" But he said it was not just NGOs that had been lobbying him on the issue, but the upper echelons of the City as well. \"It's a world where some companies navigate their way around legitimate tax systems \u2013 and even low tax rates \u2013 with an army of clever accountants. We can be the generation that eradicates extreme poverty in our world, but we need to tackle the causes, not just the symptoms. We need to lay down the rules of the game, and we need to be prepared to enforce them. Proper companies, proper taxes, proper rules.\" Cameron said he was proud that Britain was living up to its pledge to spend 0.7% of national income on development assistance, but that greater transparency was needed to make sure the aid was well spent. The prime minister said: \"Corrupt government officials in some countries and some corporations run rings around the letter and spirit of the law to rip off hard-working people and plunder their natural resources. \"There's a long and tragic history of some African countries being stripped of their minerals behind a veil of secrecy. \"We can see the results: the government cronies get rich \u2013 some beyond their wildest dreams of avarice \u2013 while the people stay poor.\" Cameron said that unleashing the natural resources from developing countries would dwarf anything aid could do \u2013 and transparency was vital to that. Pledging to shine a light on the issue, the prime minister added: \"So we're going to push for more transparency on who owns companies, on who's buying up land and for what purpose, on how governments spend their money, on how gas, oil and mining companies operate, on who is hiding stolen assets and how we recover and return them.\" Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of Save the Children International, said: \"I would like people going away from Davos to remember as much about this Cameron speech as his speech [on Europe] yesterday.\"",
