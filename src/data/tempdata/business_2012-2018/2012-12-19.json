      "bodyText": "The record \u00a3940m fine levied on Swiss bank UBS threatens to shift the focus of the worldwide Libor-rigging investigations to the intricate web of relationships between banks and brokers at the heart of the financial system. More than 2,000 requests for \"inappropriate submissions\" to the crucial interest rates were documented by the Financial Services Authority, which found 45 UBS traders, managers and senior managers were involved in, or aware of, the practice of manipulating the benchmark rate. Some 1,000 of these requests were made to 11 brokers at six brokerage firms, the FSA said. While the participants were not named, the UK regulator found that brokers had accepted \"corrupt\" payments \u2013 as much as \u00a315,000 a quarter \u2013 for helping UBS to manipulate the rate. American regulators also found that UBS colluded with at least four other banks on the panel that set Libor to make false submissions, and induced at least five interdealer brokers to disseminate false information or otherwise influence other panel banks' submissions. The regulators published a series of colourful email exchanges and telephone conversations. One phone call on 18 September 2008 \u2013 just days after the collapse of Lehman Brothers \u2013 illustrates the type of promises made by UBS traders. \"If you keep 6s [the six-month Japanese yen Libor rate] unchanged today \u2026 I will fucking do one humongous deal with you,\" the trader told a broker. \"Like a 50,000-buck deal, whatever.

It was bailed out in October 2008 at about the time that UK banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 also braced for a Libor-rigging fine \u2013 were rescued by taxpayers. One trader at UBS devised strategies that were put in place to help ensure he made profits for other trading positions linked to Japanese yen. \"Sometimes he looked ahead and conducted sustained manipulative operations for weeks to move yen Libor in the direction he needed, even coining names for these longer-term schemes, such as 'the Turn Campaign' and 'Operation 6m',\" said the US regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The FSA is continuing investigations into six other financial companies \u2013 not all of them banks \u2013 after taking action against Barclays, which was fined a total of \u00a3290m in June, and now UBS. A dozen firms around the world are thought to be under investigation. RBS, Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan are among the many banks that have made legal disclosures about co-operating with authorities. RBS has fired traders, while interdealer broker Icap has suspended one trader and put three on administrative leave. Lawyers are warning of further arrests after the Serious Fraud Office arrested three British men last week concerning the Libor investigation. \"Of particular interest in today's announcement of UBS's global settlement is the detail that has emerged of the heavy involvement of interdealer brokers in fixing the Libor rate and the alleged corrupt payments to these brokers,\" said David O'Mahony, complex fraud barrister at 7 Bedford Row chambers. \"It is highly likely that other banks may now be implicated in similar dealings with these brokers and further arrests may well occur.\" There are also concerns about potential litigation. \"The big unknown factor is the civil litigation that could follow on as a result of this,\" Paras Anand, European equities head at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, one of UBS's biggest investors, told Reuters. \"The issue for shareholders is the challenge of pricing that risk in.\" The bank's shares slipped only slightly on the scale of the fine, which follows a wave of embarrassments for UBS, including the jailing last month of former trader Kweku Adoboli.

      "bodyText": "The scale of the UBS Libor-rigging is breathtaking. According to the reports from UK, US and Swiss regulators, nearly 2,000 requests for the Japanese yen Libor to be manipulated were documented, in instant messages, emails and by telephone. Almost every one of them was suspicious. How many requests were made orally can only be guessed at. The extent of the rigging raises a number of questions and observations: this wasn't a mad moment for the traders involved. It went on for years \u2013 2005 to 2010 \u2013 firstly to generate profits and later to cover up the bank's financial problems. It was simple \u2013 it was not picked up by five internal audits, despite corrupt payments being made to people outside the bank. It was standard behaviour \u2013 about 40 traders were involved. It also proves that Barclays \u2013 whose top three executives were ousted as a result of the scandal \u2013 was not the worst offender. At UBS the bosses have already been replaced \u2013 not as a result of this shocking behaviour but as a consequence of another scandal altogether \u2013 the \u00a31.5bn losses run up by recently jailed London trader Kweku Adoboli. There is more to come \u2013 RBS has also 'fessed' up to wholesale dishonesty in its Libor dealings and is negotiating the financial price it must pay. Six other financial firms are also in the frame. One striking element of the cross-border settlements is the level of fines considered appropriate by the UK regulator and the whopping penalities slapped on these wrongdoers in the US. UBS has to write a cheque for \u00a3160m to the Financial Services Authority \u2013 30% of the UK watchdog's annual budget, which is provided by a levy on firms regulated. Another \u00a340m will go to the Swiss regulator, Finma. But \u00a3740m is on its way to the US department of justice and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. At Barclays the \u00a3290m fine was split \u00a3230m/\u00a360m in favour of the US regulators. Why the vast difference for the same offences?

      "bodyText": "Share prices jumped to their highest level for nine months in London on Wednesday night amid hopes that Barack Obama can clinch a crucial deal to prevent the US economy plunging over the so-called \"fiscal cliff\". The FTSE 100 index of leading shares closed up 0.4% at 5,961: close to the psychologically important 6,000 mark it last hit in July last year. In the US, however, where the fiscal cliff has been the main focus of anxious investors since Obama won a second term in the White House, share prices were flat on Wednesday, as Wall Street tried to calculate how any agreement would hit the economy. Without a deal between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill, automatic spending cuts and tax rises worth $600bn (\u00a3370bn) are due to kick in at the start of 2013, and analysts have warned that they could plunge the US economy back into recession. Both the White House and Republicans have appeared to offer concessions in recent days \u2013 including, on Obama's part, an agreement to use a lower measure of inflation to uprate social security benefits: an approach already taken by George Osborne as he battles to eliminate the structural budget deficit in the UK. Ratings agency Fitch ratcheted up the pressure on negotiators in Washington by repeating its warning that it could strip the world's largest economy of its AAA rating if a deal is not reached. \"If the negotiations on the fiscal cliff and raising the debt ceiling extend into 2013 and appear likely to be prolonged, with adverse implications for the economy and financial stability, the US sovereign rating could be subject to review, potentially leading to a negative rating action,\" it said in its twice-yearly report.

On this side of the Atlantic, share prices have looked likely to push through 6,000 several times in 2012, but investors have been scared off each time, whether by the weaker-than-expected recovery in the UK economy; the deterioration in emerging markets, where many UK-listed firms make a large proportion of their profits; or the continued turmoil in the eurozone. Few analysts are expecting a bumper year for share prices in 2013, with the eurozone crisis still far from over, and the world's central banks running out of ammunition to reflate debt-burdened western economies. Wednesday's relatively upbeat mood in the Square Mile followed news that just one member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee dissented from the majority decision to leave its quantitative easing programme unchanged at \u00a3375bn earlier this month. David Miles, consistently one of the more doveish members of the MPC, voted for a \u00a325bn extension of \"QE\". \"We expect the MPC to stay firmly on hold over the coming months,\" said Allan Monks of JP Morgan. The Bank's summary of its regional agents' monthly reports offered some minor signs of an improvement in economic conditions, including what they called a \"gentle pickup in retail sales growth\"; and news that \"the slowdown in export growth had eased marginally, and sales remained slightly higher on a year earlier\". MPC members are pinning their hopes on the Funding for Lending scheme (FLS) \u2013 the joint Treasury-Bank effort to cut the cost of lending to consumers and businesses by offering cut-price guarantees to banks, on condition that they pass the benefit on to borrowers. However, Alan Clarke of Scotiabank said the Bank's policymakers should not rule out the risk that the FLS will fail to unblock the frozen banking system. \"The committee should be using this period of calm to think about plan C \u2013 ie what happens if the FLS isn't as successful as originally hoped.

Osborne clearly thinks he has bagged the hottest property in central banking rather than an expensive foreign mercenary; someone who can calibrate monetary policy so that the massive stimulus provided to the economy over the past four years can be withdrawn at precisely the right moment. And, while he's at it, preside over the new regulatory regime for the City to ensure the excesses of the early 2000s are not repeated.

      "body": "<p>A lack of spending power for financially stretched consumers means Britain's Christmas shopping season has got off to a slow start, the CBI said.</p> <p>Reports from high street shops and stores showed that sales in the first two weeks of December were weaker than retailers had been predicting.</p> <p>The monthly check by the employers' organisation showed 36% of firms reporting sales up on the same period of 2011, while 17% said they were down. The balance of +19 percentage points was weaker and failed to match the +25 points expected in the November distributive trades survey and was below the balances of +30 and +33 points in the previous two months.</p> <p>Anna Leach, CBI head of economic analysis, said: \"This month's survey hasn't quite provided the Christmas cheer that retailers anticipated, with sales growth falling short of expectations.</p> <p>\"Clearly, weak spending power and uncertainty over the economic outlook are likely to remain key risks to the retail sector in 2013.\"</p> <p>The CBI said a majority of retailers polled said business was below average for the time of year. There was a belief that trading conditions would remain tough in January. A balance of -10 percentage points of firms said sales were poor for a pre-Christmas period. A balance of +10 points said they expected activity in January 2013 to be better than in January 2012.</p> <p>Judith McKenna, the chair of the CBI's distributive trades panel and chief operating officer of Asda, said: \"This latest data covers the period to the middle of December and we should take heart that sales on the high street have held up during the early crucial Christmas shopping period.

      "bodyText": "A lack of spending power for financially stretched consumers means Britain's Christmas shopping season has got off to a slow start, the CBI said. Reports from high street shops and stores showed that sales in the first two weeks of December were weaker than retailers had been predicting. The monthly check by the employers' organisation showed 36% of firms reporting sales up on the same period of 2011, while 17% said they were down. The balance of +19 percentage points was weaker and failed to match the +25 points expected in the November distributive trades survey and was below the balances of +30 and +33 points in the previous two months. Anna Leach, CBI head of economic analysis, said: \"This month's survey hasn't quite provided the Christmas cheer that retailers anticipated, with sales growth falling short of expectations. \"Clearly, weak spending power and uncertainty over the economic outlook are likely to remain key risks to the retail sector in 2013.\" The CBI said a majority of retailers polled said business was below average for the time of year. There was a belief that trading conditions would remain tough in January. A balance of -10 percentage points of firms said sales were poor for a pre-Christmas period. A balance of +10 points said they expected activity in January 2013 to be better than in January 2012. Judith McKenna, the chair of the CBI's distributive trades panel and chief operating officer of Asda, said: \"This latest data covers the period to the middle of December and we should take heart that sales on the high street have held up during the early crucial Christmas shopping period. However, on-going economic fragility is maintaining the squeeze on household incomes, and it's notable that sales are below par for the festive season. \"So while families are making their budget stretch as far as possible for the Christmas season, the Christmas spending spirit can only go so far. In reality, sales growth has actually slowed since the autumn and retailers are expecting a further slowdown in the new year.\" Supermarkets and clothing and footwear stores had the most to cheer about in the first two weeks of December, according to the survey, but consumer wariness over spending on big-ticket items meant another difficult month for companies selling durable household goods. After the strong 1% expansion in national output in the third quarter of 2012, analysts are expecting a slight contraction in gross domestic product in the final three months of the year, and said the softness of retail spending shown up by the CBI report was consistent with a still struggling economy. Howard Archer, chief UK economist for IHS Global Insight, said: \"The CBI distributive trends survey for December was weaker than expected, fuelling concerns that retail sales are lacklustre so far over the vital Christmas period. This is particularly worrying news for retailers and it does not do much for overall growth hopes for the fourth quarter.\" Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the fact that the CBI survey was conducted between 29 November and 12 December meant there was still hope for retailers of a pick-up in spending in the last days before Christmas. \"But with pay growth weak and real earnings continuing to decline, household budgets can only stretch so far. Whatever happens at Christmas, we doubt that a decent revival in household spending will be in prospect for some time yet.\"",

      "bodyText": "With all quiet in Athens (and with news editors everywhere wondering where they left that \"FTSE crashes through 6,000 feature\" which got canned in March\") I\"m drawing events to a close. See you all tomorrow? Thanks, and goodnight! European stock markets have closed after a solid day's trading. In London, the FTSE closed at its highest level since March this year (not since July 2011 as first thought). FTSE 100: up 25 points at 5961, +0.4% German DAX: up 19 points at 7673, + 0.25% French CAC: up 16 points at 3664, +0.44% Spanish IBEX: up 95 points at 8264, + 1.1% Italian FTSE MIB: up 177 points at 16332, + 1.1% Optimism over the eurocrisis, and the US fiscal cliff negotiations, get the credit. Plus, the City likes a good 'Santa rally'.... Here's our final selection of photos from the rally in Athens, which concluded without another bout of molotov cocktail-tossing, tear gassing or stone-pelting. But the picture for many Athenians remains bleak this Christmas. Away from the chanting marchers, a soup kitchen was providing food to the poor: Anti-austerity protests have also been taking place at Madrid's Complutense University, where students and researchers demonstrated against cuts to science budgets. They also released a mass of balloons.... Budget airline Ryanair has some good news for Greece today \u2013 it is opening its first \"Greek base\" on the Crete city of Chania. Ryanair already flies to Chania from 15 locations including Edinburgh, London and Milan, and today's move means another 11 routes (including to/from Bristol, Venice and Warsaw). It also reckoned the move will create 500 jobs (based on an estimate of 500,000 extra passengers per year) Greek unions officials have confirmed that participation in today's strike was smaller than on other occasions. Fewer people attended the rallies outside parliament too. One reason, it seems, is that many people simply can't afford to lose a day's pay: Helena Smith, our correspondent in Athens, reports: Ilias Iliopoulos, ADEDY's general secretary, put the number of demonstrators between seven and eight thousand and reckoned that participation in the strike had exceeded no more than 60%. \u201cI think people thought about their Christmas meal and what they would have on the table and didn\u2019t want to lose the money,\u201d he explained. \u201cEvery time we take part in a strike we not only lose our salary for the day but have to fork out for social insurance as well.\u201d But Iliopoulos cautioned that the government should not expect such an easy ride in the New Year. \u201cThe main slogan today was that we will continue, without taking a step back, to resist these policies until they are overturned,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd we won\u2019t hesitate to exhaust ourselves in our efforts to kick out a government that has decided to cooperate with the troika and speculators who are profiting at our expense.\u201d Reuters reports that state hospitals have been operating on skeleton staff today because employees took part in today's walkout, and that around 100 workers occupied the offices of Athens' city train company in protest at planned wage cuts there. As suspected, there is a sizeable police presence in Athens. Local reports say around 2,000 officers are on the streets, but so far the demonstrations have passed peacefully.... Our first set of photos from the protests in Athens have just arrived: The European Central Bank has given Greece a vote of confidence \u2013 announcing that it will accept Greek debt as collateral again. The ECB said its move was in recognition of Greece's economic reforms, its budget plans, and the (faltering?) steps it has taken towards privatising its assets. That means commercial banks can use Greek bonds as security when they borrow from the ECB. Traders have rushed to buy Greek bonds, pushing down the yield on its 10-year debt to just 12.1%, from 12.8% overnight. Good news for investors who held onto their Greek bonds, and great news for those who bought at distressed prices this year. Not so cheery for those who took part in this month's debt swap..... Political analysts suspect that Mario Monti will back a moderate group of parties when he finally reveals his plans (see 13.07 post), rather than subjecting himself to the will of the people: Important developments in Italy this lunchtime... the eagerly awaited announcement on Mario Monti's plans has been delayed. Monti had been planning to get Italy\u2019s 2013 budget passed this week, allowing him to stand down and reveal on Friday whether he will stand for office. However, the plan has come off the rails, thanks to Silvio Berlusconi. From Rome, Tom Kington reports: The former prime minister, who has already pulled his parliamentary support for Monti \u2013 prompting Monti\u2019s decision to step down \u2013 had previously guaranteed his support for the budget law. But now Berlusconi has u-turned on both positions, surprisingly offering to back a Monti coalition government, while his MPs hold up the budget. As a result of the delay Monti has postponed his long awaited conference on Friday, possibly until after parliament can be dissolved next week, which depends on the budget passing. Berlusconi has stated he would like to see the coming election \u2013 currently scheduled for the second half of February \u2013 pushed back a week or two, with critics alleging he wants more time to dominate the airwaves through his TV channels before pre-election rules kick in limiting air time for politicians. Berlusconi has admitted he needs to be beamed into Italian homes to boost his standing in the polls and has given long TV interviews each of the last three nights, stressing the painful property tax Italians have just paid. He may be well behind the centre-left Democratic Party in the polls, but his trickery this week and ability to dictate the political agenda shows that he cannot be ignored. Photojournalist Mehran Khalili \u200freports that the mood in Athens is more peaceful than at previous strikes, with some people still pressing on with the Christmas shopping. He also tweeted a rather fine panoramic photo: Today's strike comes amid a backdrop of frantic government activity in Athens. Helena Smith reports: With less than a week to go before Christmas, prime minister Antonis Samaras appears to be in little holiday mood. Until late into the night, the conservative leader held roundtable talks with his junior partners in a bid to improve the coordination of his often fragile coalition as it braces itself for 2013 and what is widely believed will be the toughest year yet since debt-stricken Greece descended into crisis in late 2009. After almost six months of tortuous negotiations to get to this point [of appeasing lenders enough to unlock the funds the country so needs to keep itself afloat], Samaras, says aides, is now determined not to lose the momentum that the bumper cash injection will bring. \u201cWe have to be in continuous coordination. Whatever we vote we must enact and we [must] proceed with determination,\u201d he said, emerging from talks that the finance minister Yiannis Stournaras described as \u201ccrucial.\u201d Greece\u2019s tripartite government will remember December 18 as a good day, and not just because of S&amp;P's six-notch upgrade (see 8.41am) Lloyds also announced that 15 Greek shipowners were among the 100 most important shipowners in the world \u2013 and in so doing placed the Greek maritime fleet as the second most important globally. On the agricultural front Samaras declared that some \u20ac1.4bn would be injected during the course of 2013 into promoting new agricultural produce \u2013 investments that the government hopes will translate into more exports in the organic food industry. But with record levels of poverty and unemployment on course to only get worse (as a result of the belt-tightening measures the government must apply) the challenges are immense. \u201cThe road ahead is difficult and steep,\u201d said Stournaras as he also emerged from last night\u2019s talks. If the government is to avoid the pitfalls that enforcement of more cuts and increased taxes and higher bills will inevitably bring - and fears of social upheaval have not abated --it knows it has to somehow soften the impact of recession-inducing measures on Greeks. Evangelos Venizelos, the socialist Pasok leader could not have put it better. \u201cWe are organizing a new start for the country following the conclusion of the very difficult negotiations with our creditors and partners. The issue now is to recover from recession, limit the threat of unemployment and regain a positive feeling \u2026 [so that] the Greek citizen feels secure and consciously believes that these very difficult and heavy measures are really the last [measures],\u201d he said. It will need work. \u201cIt requires social consensus and the belief in a national strategy,\u201d insisted the politician. Barnaby Phillip, Al Jazeera's man in Athens, tweets this photo from outside the parliament Moscovici also says that a \u20ac2bn fund will be set up to rescue ailing banks, eventually rising to \u20ac10bn. Pierre Moscovici, the French finance minister, has been outlining his long-awaited reforms to the banking industry and they fall short of the radical shake-up long promised by the Hollande government. \u2022 The ringfence around banks' riskier operations will affect only 10% of a bank's capital, Moscovivi says, which is a long way short of the 25% envisioned by the Liikanen report - the European Commission's version of the Vickers report into banks in the UK. \u2022 He says only \"some\" bondholders will be made to carry the can for rescuing banks in future. That means that senior creditors will be off the hook. \u2022 He adds that the plan will \"stand as a model for the rest of Europe\" and that Germany was considering a similar overhaul. Ten-year Portuguese bond yields have fallen below 7% for the first time since February 2011. They briefly dropped below the magic mark in after-hours trading last night but are sitting proudly at 6.982% this morning. Zougla, the Greek TV station, is transmitting footage from Athens here. All looks peaceful so far. The loud chants of angry protesters have begun to waft over Athens as the mass rally against internationally mandated austerity measures gets underway. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports that the unions are \"ratcheting up the pressure\" on the Greek coalition, as it celebrates receiving \u20ac34.4bn in rescue loans from its international lenders: Helena writes: The mass walkout, to be joined by workers in the private sector, reinforces what is all too often forgotten: that behind all the number crunching and finger-pointing and extolling of budget targets, there are real people whose lives are being dramatically overturned by policies that until now have focused exclusively on cutting the country out of its debt crisis. The German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s confession that she has thought more about Greece than ever before and not \u201cwithout a certain inner involvement,\u201d will do little to alleviate the pain of pensioners and low-income Greeks who have borne the brunt of successive rounds of mostly German-dictated austerity. Today's is the fifth general strike since September. \u201cAs long as these policies continue unions and workers will try to overturn them,\u201d ADEDY\u2019s spokeswoman Tania Karayiannis has just told me. \u201cWe have been constantly told that by applying the memorandum,\u201d she said referring to the terms and conditions Greece signed up to when it agreed to be bailed out by the EU and IMF, \u201cwe will work our way out of the crisis and see growth. But precisely the opposite has happened and what we have seen is that these policies are not only inefficient but socially very, very unfair.\u201d For ordinary Greeks, there is little comfort in the news that their country now has a better credit rating (see 8.41am). Nick Malkoutzis, deputy editor of the English edition of Kathimerini, reports that the Communist party is laying staff off: Kathimerini has also published an article today about rising poverty in Greece, where growing numbers of people cannot afford to heat their homes or workplaces. The household price for heating oil in Greece reached \u20ac1,266 per 1,000 litres (264 gallons) in the second quarter of 2012, surging 48% from a year earlier, according to the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based organisation. The same quantity cost \u00a3700 (\u20ac861) in the UK, according to the IEA, and $1,045 (\u20ac790) in New York, according to a state agency. Kathimerini also interviewed a furrier, Christos Tsitskos, who reports that demand for pelts has dried up, adding: Even after 40 years in the trade, Tsitskos doesn\u2019t have any furs to keep warm. The one fur coat he owned was sold years ago. Another photo from Greece: Back to Greece, and our first photos have just arrived. They show a closed railway station in Athens as a strike by railway workers (which is scheduled to run for two days) gets underway. As I wrote at 8.25am, suburban railway services are disrupted by the walkout. Long-distance routes in Greece are also hit. However, trams and buses in Athens are expected to run normally. Living in Greece also flags up that the Syntagma &amp; Panepistimio metro stations will be closed while the protests take place in Athens \u2013 starting in around 30 minutes\u2026 The Bank of England's latest minutes are online here (pdf). And here's some instant analysis from Jeremy Cook of World First: Just in, the Bank of England's monetary policy committee was split 8-1 this month, with one member voting for a further dose of quantitative easing. The minutes of the last meeting, just released, showed that David Miles felt the UK economy needed another stimulus, through \u00a325bn of extra bond purchases. The other members, though, voted for no change. Again, the MPC voted 9-0 to leave interest rates at 0.5%. Germany's IFO survey, which tracks sentiment among businesses, has risen for the second month running. German firms are \"modestly optimistic\", IFO reported, but are \"somewhat more sceptical\" than the financial markets about the central banks' ability to overcome the crisis. The French government is due to announce its plans to reform its banking sector this morning. However, the measures are not expected to amount to the \"long war\" that Fran\u00e7ois Hollande promised during his successful race for the presidency. Reuters explains that the French banking sector simply isn't strong enough to support a big tax raid. Proprietary trading (so-called 'casino banking') is also expected to be untouched: The overhaul, to be announced on Wednesday, will ultimately hit only a sliver of banks' profit, according to a leaked draft of the bill. That will hand a victory to top banks like BNP Paribas and Societe Generale, reflecting months of intense lobbying. French finance minister Pierre Moscovici, who will hold a news conference to present the law at 1100 GMT, hit back at critics who say the law does not go far enough by saying his aim was also to defend French interests. \"(We must) protect the interests of Paris as a financial centre,\" he told Le Parisien newspaper. \"We went as far as possible.\" The finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, will reveal the plan at 11am GMT, or noon Paris time. The euro has hit a seven-and-a-half month high against the US dollar this morning, and a 16-month high against the Japanese yen. One euro is now worth $1.324, a level not seen since May. Along with S&amp;P's upgrade of Greece, the positive noises from Washington over the US fiscal cliff are helping to boost sentiment. This graph from eurozone commentator Yiannis Mouzakis shows how Spanish and Italian borrowing costs have eased in recent months after spiking during the summer (Italy in blue, Spain in red, just like the football teams) S&amp;P's six-notch upgrade of Greece last night has cheered the financial markets, with Spain's IBEX stock market up 61 points, or 0.75%, in early trading. Elisabeth Afseth of Investec suggests it could be a landmark moment, pointing out that B- is the highest rating S&amp;P has given Greece since May 2011: \"Is it the sign that the European debt crisis is over? Strong determination by Greece\u2019s European partners to keep it in the eurozone was behind the upgrade. If all goes according to plan we might be through the worst, but if there are any hick-ups the latter part of next year, post German elections, could be a turbulent period. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said the City was a \"much less risk averse environment\": Investors have been putting money back into Italian and Spanish bond markets and pulling money out of German and UK bond markets, narrowing spread differentials quite sharply. Thousands of teachers, doctors and municipal workers are expected to take to the streets and rally in central Athens around midday local time (10am GMT), Reuters reckons. In an official statement, ADEDY said the strike had been called because: The serious problems that workers in the public sector face, because of thousands of firings and understaffing, underfunding and the abandonment of public services, as well as the whole of Greek society... requires that we continue with and escalate our struggle and mobilisations. The main private sector union, GSEE, has called a three-hour walkout, from noon till 3pm local time (10am-1pm GMT). Living in Greece lags up that domestic flights will be disrupted by a walkout by ADEDY members, with Olympic Air cancelling seven flights and rescheduling another five (details here). International fights are not expected to be affected, though. It also appears that suburban railway services are disrupted today. Living in Greece's dedicated strike page remains the best source of info. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events in the world economy. Greece is ending the year where it spent most of 2012 - in the spotlight. Public sector workers are holding a 24-hour general strike today, in protest at the country's austerity programme and the prospect of looming job cuts. The walkout is the latest attempt to derail Athens' fiscal reform programme, and was called by the ADEDY union. It hopes for a decent turnout. As ADEDY chief Costas Tsikrikas said: We demand that the government changes these unjust policies that hurt workers and kill the public sector.... We expect a large turnout in the strike. The strike comes as Athens digests a rare endorsement from the credit rating agencies. Last night, Standard &amp; Poor's upgraded Greece's rating by a vertiginous six-notches, from \"selective default\" to \"B-minus\". S&amp;P praised the eurozone's \"strong determination\" to keep Greece in the currency union, and Athens' own progress. Quite a turnaround from six months ago, when pundits were falling over themselves to predict Greece's imminent ejection from the euro.... As usual, I'll be tracking the action across the eurozone today.",

      "bodyText": "Incoming Bank of England governor Mark Carney will pocket an annual \u00a3250,000 housing allowance, taking his total pay package close to \u00a31m a year when he takes the reins next summer, the central bank has revealed. Carney will receive the allowance as part of a generous package put together by the chancellor, George Osborne, to lure him from his current job in Ottawa as boss of the Canadian central bank. It was already known that Carney would be paid a salary of \u00a3480,000 and pension contributions worth \u00a3144,000. He will also receive free health and dental insurance and the use of a chauffeur-driven car. The revelation that he will gain a further \u00a3250,000 to house his wife and four children is likely to shock MPs and campaign groups concerned at wage inflation for top executives when wage rises are limited to 1% across the public sector. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said Carney's large salary would propel him into the top bracket of best paid public servants. \"When the government is rightly planning to cap housing benefit, it will certainly stick in the throat of many that Mr Carney is receiving more per year in housing allowance than the average price of a British home,\" he said. A statement from the central bank's non-executive directors said that while Carney's remuneration appears high, it is similar to the \u00a3305,000 pay enjoyed by Sir Mervyn King once the bank's \u00a3300,000 a year contribution to King's final salary pension fund is taken into account. However, King has not received pension contributions for the last four years, as his scheme is fully funded. \"Although the next governor's salary of \u00a3480,000 is considerably higher than the salary of the current governor (\u00a3305,000) the cost to the Bank of enrolling him in the now closed pension scheme previously available to the governor and deputy governors would approximate to more than 100% of salary. This compares with the 30% cash allowance in lieu of pension to which the next governor will become entitled,\" it said. Carney is already mired in controversy over his links to opposition MPs in Canada where it is alleged he held talks about becoming leader of the opposition Liberal party. He was cleared after an internal review, but the reports sparked warnings from former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott and former City minister Lord Myners to be mindful of the independence of the Bank of England when he takes up the post next July. The Bank of England said the extra \u00a3250,000 accommodation fee would be taxed at the higher rate of 45%.",

      "bodyText": "Bank of England policymakers kept their hands firmly on the brake this month despite broad agreement that the economy remained weak and was likely to worsen slightly into the new year. According to minutes of its meeting earlier this month, the monetary policy committee voted 8 to 1 against pumping further funds into the economy following a report that inflation is likely to stay above 2% next year. The vote sent a clear signal that the global situation, the recession across the eurozone and the UK economy will need to deteriorate further before a majority of MPC members agree to boost the central bank's quantitative easing beyond \u00a3375bn. David Miles, the former City economist and external member of the MPC, argued there was enough slack in the economy to allow a boost to output without extra inflation, but his call for an increase in QE to \u00a3400bn was voted down. Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the MPC was in \"wait and see mode\" and was likely to need a strong indication of a downturn before increasing the volume of QE. \"The committee's comments suggest that more QE is not imminent.

Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the MPC may decide to increase QE in the new year, if only to drive down the value of the pound relative to other currencies.

In November the Bank agreed to return coupon payments on the government bonds it had bought so far under the QE scheme, saying the transfer would be equivalent to more than \u00a335bn worth of monetary easing. However, in the minutes central bankers said the monetary impact of the transfer would be slightly smaller in the very short term than initially assumed, because it had led to a reduction in the issuance of Treasury bills rather than gilts.
