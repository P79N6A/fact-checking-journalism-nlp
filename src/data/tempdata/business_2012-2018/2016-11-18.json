Analysts are reporting an 18% increase in the wholesale price of pork, with the surge expected to have a knock-on effect on the price of bacon and sausages in supermarkets in the coming weeks. \u201cPork prices in the UK have risen very fast,\u201d said Rabobank analyst Albert Vernooij. \u201cSetting [shop] prices is up to the retailers but at a certain point you would expect higher [wholesale] prices will be passed on to consumers. There is always a delay.\u201d Vernooij said Britain only produces just over half of the pork it consumes. Food manufacturers and retailers are facing multiple problems as they manage the impact of commodity price swings as well as the weakness of sterling following the Brexit vote. According to official figures the price of materials and fuels for manufacturers rose 12.2% in the year to October 2016. There is also evidence firms are passing the pain on to their customers with factory gate prices up 2.1% on the year. The tough conditions are creating friction, with last month\u2019s \u201cMarmitegate\u201d stand-off between Tesco and Unilever the first to spill into the public domain as the supermarket resisted the manufacturer\u2019s attempt to push through price increases. Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said the retailer is already seeing inflation in certain food categories, particularly pork, but is only willing to tolerate pricing increases from suppliers faced with \u201clegitimate\u201d cost pressures. According to consultancy Mintec, the price of \u201cpig deadweight\u201d \u2013 essentially the price farmers receive for slaughtered pigs \u2013 is 18% higher than a year ago, at around \u00a3150 per 100kg. \u201cLow pork prices earlier in the year resulted in many UK farmers reducing the size of their herds,\u201d said Mintec analyst Emma Smith. \u201cAs a result, slaughter levels in the UK were down in September, at 910,500 head \u2013 3% below the same period last year.\u201d The surge in the wholesale price will not affect the cost of British favourites such as bacon, sausages and sausage rolls in a uniform way, said Vernooij. Britons\u2019 love of bacon means manufacturers have to import loin to satisfy demand, whereas there is sufficient domestic supply of the belly and shoulder cuts used to make sausages. Last week, Premier Foods, the group behind brands such as Mr Kipling and Cadbury cakes, signalled price rises were on the horizon as the price of butter soared 80%, while wheat and edible oils were up 40% due to a combination of commodity price rises and currency exchange rate pressure. Its chief executive Gavin Darby said the price of sugar had also risen by 20% to 30%.",

My company, IBM, produced PCs in state-of-the-art plants in Greenock and Havant, for which it won export awards and its chair got a knighthood. Then, on a globalisation tide, both UK plants were shut, well-paid workers lost their jobs and manufacturing was moved, for cheaper labour, to Mexico \u2013 where, typically, plants were not owned by IBM but by sub-contractors which managed employees. These enforced 28-day contracts, regular physical tests, such as strip-searches, and medical tests (including pregnancy tests for women). Tattooed and long-haired applicants for jobs were rejected. Because holidays were conditional on one year\u2019s service, nobody got any: one man was fired for asking for just one day off. Initially, pay was \u00a370 a week, enough to live on, but it fell to half that. After leaving IBM I worked on a successful campaign to get IBM, Dell and HP to accept proper conditions for their sub-contracted workers. But then manufacture moved to China, where wages were even lower. As Lawrence says, Nafta, Ceta and TTIP all give more power and money to big business. They should be scrapped. David Murray Wallington, Surrey \u2022 Both the government and society are responsible for our move to the \u201cnew world of work\u201d (Special report series since 16 November). Ask any delivery driver who comes to your door from Hermes or similar, and you will be told of the appalling conditions of their work. This need not have happened. These companies are in competition with Royal Mail/Parcel Force, and protection against unfair practices should have been given when the market was deregulated. But if every reader of the Guardian complains to their supplier when a product is delivered by one of these organisations, we might just start to change attitudes. David Becket Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire \u2022 Unemployment as officially measured may have dropped (Unemployment falls to 11-year low, 17 November) but let\u2019s be clear: people count as employed if they do paid work just one hour a week or if they are self-employed. It would be interesting to know whether employment measured as total hours worked by the workforce has gone up \u2013 and then whether most of that is accounted for by the growth of the workforce. There are lies, damned lies and government statistics. Dr Brian Curwain Christchurch, Dorset \u2022 I am self-employed: I set my own charge rates, I decide when, where and for whom I work, and I make my own arrangements with HMRC. I am perfectly content with my income. People working for Uber, Deliveroo et al are freelance workers, not self-employed. There is a significant difference. While I have no doubt that these employers are exploiting the vulnerability of their employees, I also suspect that they never expected anyone to rely on taxi or delivery work alone as a source of income, rather than as an intermittent arrangement as and when circumstances allowed. Michael Heaton Warminster, Wiltshire \u2022 Over the past 30 years or so there has been a concerted effort by the media, industry and government to change our vocabulary about industrial relations. When I was a shop steward in local government in the early 1990s, we lost personnel departments, to be replaced by human resources departments with their desensitising language. We no longer had redundancies or privatisation, but instead had downsizing and outsourcing. They mean exactly the same things, of course, but, accompanied by the Thatcher anti-trade union legislation, the change of language certainly did dampen people\u2019s enthusiasm for any kind of industrial action. Fast forward to the present day, and we now have the \u201cgig economy\u201d, all part of the economic miracle of the Conservative government. The word gig suggests something vibrant or youthful, with its links to live music and computers. The reality is totally different. The gig economy stands for zero hours contracts, no holiday pay, no pension rights, no sick pay. Yet all media outlets use the term freely. Can we make a start at claiming back our language please \u2013 starting with the Guardian not using the term gig economy any more but instead choosing something like \u201csweat-shop economy\u201d? Anyone in such a jobs can relate to that, as can the wider public? John Holroyd Thornhill, Dumfries \u2022 Given the changes in the economy, shouldn\u2019t the statistics showing the welcome fall in the number of the unemployed also reveal the number of the under-employed?

    "webTitle": "Mario Draghi hints eurozone stimulus will last - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The oil price has been dominated in recent days by the strength of the dollar weighing it down, and hopes of an agreement to cut output at Opec\u2019s meeting at the end of the month giving some support. But the weekly US inventory numbers also have an impact, as do the Baker Hughes surveys of the number of operating rigs. The latest Baker Hughes numbers, just released, showed 20 rigs were added last week, the 22nd rise in 25 weeks. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. The recent fall in the euro against the dollar brings closer the possibility of the currencies reaching parity. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: As the week draws to a close, the euro/dollar is still limping, now below 1.06. It could absolutely collapse next week as the dollar appreciates further. The market seems convinced that the Fed will hike interest rates in December and tighten its belt further in 2017. Meanwhile the ECB and other major central banks are widely expected to maintain their current extremely loose policy stances intact well into 2017 at the very least. As such, the dollar is getting stronger across the board, but especially against currencies where the central bank is still uber-dovish such as the euro... To get anywhere near parity, the euro/dollar will first need to break and then hold below the prior support around the 1.0460/1.0525 area. As things stand, this looks like a good possibility... However, as always, it is worth remembering that the markets are forward-looking. As such, the outlook for the diverging monetary policy stances in the Eurozone and US may already be priced in, if not fully then maybe partially. But price needs to confirm this view by creating a distinct reversal pattern. Until and unless such a technical signal is generated, the path of least resistance remains to the downside. Despite a record high in the US tech-heavy market Nasdaq (subsequently reversed), European shares have ended the week on a downbeat note. The continuing uncertainties over Brexit and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election have made investors in Europe cautious. And with the next possible electoral shock coming next month in the Italian referendum, it is the Italian market that bore the brunt of the day\u2019s losses. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: A record high in the Nasdaq and a pullback in bond yields helped to unwind some of the early losses in stock markets, though most European equity benchmarks finished the week on a soft note. Election fever has caught the investing world. With populism running amuck and Italy\u2019s referendum up next, Italian shares have been the notable losers this week. Meanwhile Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Today\u2019s price action serves as a metaphor for the entire week, indecisive, with a firm dose of caution after the volatility of last week. Stocks are modestly lower across the board, but for different reasons. Investors in the UK and Europe know that weakening currencies have flattered performance this week, while in the US they remain overextended to the upside. The former worry that a period of weakness for the US dollar after such a strong run could increase the chances of a correction for stocks, while the latter are wondering how long the market can keep moving higher even as the currency rises. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 18.94 points or 0.28% at 6775.77 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.2% to 10,664.56 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.52% at 4504.35 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.75% to 16,265.90 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.09% lower at 8622.9 But in Greece, the Athens market added 1.81% to 611.93 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 40 points at 0.2%. Another public appearance by a Federal Reserve member, another step towards a rise in interest rates next month. Kansas City Fed president Esther George told an oil conference in Houston the Fed should move \u201csooner rather than later\u201d but be cautious. She said: My view is that monetary policy should .. slowly raise the federal funds rate to promote maximum employment commensurate with the economy\u2019s long-run potential to increase production. But she added, as Reuters reports, that she did not advocate high rates: I do not think it will serve the economy well. I do think we have to move more systematically. She also said it was too soon to say how the incoming Donald Trump administration would affect the outlook for Fed policy. While US markets have been hovering around new highs, Europe has been struggling to keep up. Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index, said: European equity markets have failed to make much progress one way or the other this week, kicking the week off and ending it at more or less the same level. The post-election Trump rally is seen to be wearing thin this side of the Atlantic, as investors digest the growing divergence between European and US economies and the outlook for monetary policy. The dollar has continued its ascent in the wake of Yellen\u2019s hawkish testimony before Congress, where her positive comments regarding the US economy have spurred the currency to break through 101.00 and hit fresh 13 year highs. Yet while Yellen was more or less confirming a rate hike in December and several rate hikes for next year, European Central Bank President, Draghi was clearly on the other side of the fence. Draghi stated that the Eurozone recovery was reliant on ECB stimulus possibly hinting that ECB monetary stimulus will continue beyond its planned conclusion next March. As a result, the Euro has continued to sell of against the dollar and is currently at $1.0609 setting its sights on $1.04 against the dollar going forward... Gold, like bonds, has been one of the more noticeable losers of a Trump president elect, with the precious metal falling over 10% since he clinched the White House. With plans for reflationary policies such as a $1trillion spending spree on infrastructure and control of both houses meaning political gridlock is less likely, inflation expectations have risen sharply, along with debt yields and interest rate hike expectations. Hawkish comments from Yellen in her testimony to Congress renewed selling pressure on gold and given that the US dollar index is trading at fresh 13 year highs, we could see expect to see a more significant correction yet, the trend remains bearish [and] precious metal miners could be set for more pain to come. With a US interest rate rise next month now seen as almost inevitable, US markets are taking a breather after their recent highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 23 points or 0.12% while the S&amp;P 500 has edged up 0.09% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.19% better. Meanwhile the dollar remains at near-14 year highs against a basket of currencies, while US bond yields are looking at their best fortnightly rise for 13 years. The euro may be weakening against the dollar today, but there is no doubt which continues to be the worst performing currency this year: Back to Brexit, and the impact it may have on Ireland. Henry McDonald in Belfast writes: One of Northern Ireland\u2019s leading economists has warned that if the UK leaves the European Customs Union then a \u2018hard border\u2019 between the region and the Irish Republic is inevitable. Ulster Bank\u2019s chief economist in the province Richard Ramsey also told a Dublin Business School conference on Brexit on Friday that the Northern Ireland government\u2019s policy of a low corporation tax - 12.5% as in the Irish Republic - has \u201cfallen far down the agenda\u201d due to the UK voting to leave the European Union. Speaking in the Mac Arts Theatre in Belfast\u2019s Cathedral Quarter, Ramsey said: \u201cThe Customs Union is looking at the trade in goods and common tariffs coming into that area. If you leave that you then have to have some sort of hard border on how you can check up things like, for example Argentinian beef. Say that beef was infected by some bacteria and if you didn\u2019t have border checks then that meat could come into Northern Ireland, go across the border into the south and that would mean it was now inside the EU. Some people talk about using electronic tagging to track goods including that meat but I just cannot see how that would work. If we were to leave the Customs Union then a hard border even for those practical reasons would be inevitable.\u201d Ramsey said the Northern Ireland Executive\u2019s pursuit of a 12.5% corporation tax rate to compete with the Irish Republic in terms of foreign direct investment may be redundant once the entire UK including the region exits the EU. He said that when the power sharing government in Belfast embarked on its campaign for low corporation tax \u201cbeing in Europe was a given.\u201d All this changed once the UK voted for Brexit in June, he said. The Ulster Bank chief economist said: \u201cIn many ways perhaps we in Northern Ireland thought 12.5% was a one way process in which the rate would attract foreign direct investment into the region. But the rules of the game have been changed with some foreign corporations who are already here reconsidering their position about staying here. In my view the impact of a potential 12.5% corporation tax rate has been weakened significantly. If you were a foreign investor thinking of coming here you would think, \u2018hold on a minute there is no clarity about Northern Ireland and Europe whereas there is clarity in the Irish Republic.\u2019 On that basis they would decide to locate in the Republic as low corporation tax inside the EU is already guaranteed.\u201d The US, on the other hand, is set for a rate hike in December, most economists believe. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen hinted as much when she gave her testimony to Congress on Thursday, and Fed board member James Bullard has become the latest to back such a move. Reuters reports: Federal Reserve policymaker James Bullard is leaning toward supporting an interest rate increase in December, he said on Friday, adding that a plethora of potential changes under incoming president Donald Trump could affect future policy. St. Louis Federal Reserve President Bullard said the debate is now shifting toward the Fed\u2019s rate path in 2017 and how Trump\u2019s policies on taxes, infrastructure, spending and regulation will affect growth, productivity and ultimately Fed policy. \u201cMarkets are currently putting a high probability on a December move by the FOMC. I\u2019m leaning toward supporting that,\u201d Bullard, a voting member of the U.S. central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee, told a conference in Frankfurt. \u201cI think the question now is more about 2017.\u201d Markets now put a 90 percent chance on the Fed hiking rates by 25 basis points on Dec 14. Bullard said some of the new administration\u2019s measures could have a significant impact on the economy in 2018 but some possible proposals to curb immigration and trade may take a decade to have a major impact. Strong economic data from the UK - the latest being better than expected retail sales figures for October - have put the idea of an interest rate cut on hold. Indeed, the next move is likely to be upwards, despite the Bank of England maintaining it was keeping its options open. But don\u2019t expect a hike too soon, or indeed a hefty rise when it comes: After an action-packed week highlighted by Barack Obama\u2019s 30-hour visit to Athens, the Greek government has stepped up calls for debt relief, with officials saying it is only a matter of days before the country concludes a second bailout review that can formally open discussion of the issue. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Greece\u2019s straight-talking finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos said it would be \u201cvery shortsighted\u201d if Greece\u2019s monumental debt pile was not cut, echoing Obama\u2019s assertion that people needed hope. If the euro zone is going to survive, the number-one requirement is to make sure people see that the eurozone can solve its problems. If it just postpones political decisions and kicks the can down the road, then people will say it\u2019s not working. At almost 180 % of GDP, the debt mountain is widely believed to be unmanageable with both the IMF and the outgoing US president saying economic recovery now depends on at least part of it being written off. Last night, the country\u2019s hardline finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble shot down the suggestion, once again, saying it would be a deterrent to Greece forging ahead with reforms. As Philip Hammond prepares to present his maiden autumn statement on Wednesday, speculation is mounting about possible rabbits out of hats. The chancellor has already signalled that he will ease the pace of austerity set out by his predecessor George Osborne, but this does not mean he is planning big giveaways. Berenberg\u2019s Kallum Pickering believes the announcement could well underwhelm markets: With no immediate economic crisis to deal with, the new chancellor Phillip Hammond is unlikely to pander to markets\u2019 desires and announce a major fiscal stimulus at next week\u2019s autumn statement. Despite the better-than-expected near-term economic performance, the long-term economic outlook remains highly uncertain. Beyond the next couple of years, the long-term economic and fiscal outlook will be heavily influenced by the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU. Pending such uncertainty, we anticipate a very cautious approach to fiscal policy from the new chancellor. Volkswagen, the German carmaker, is cutting 30,000 jobs as it restructures the business following the diesel emissions scandal. Most of the jobs - 23,000 - will go in Germany. VW\u2019s chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, described it as the \u201cbiggest reform package in the history of our core brand\u201d. Last year the company admitted it had falsified the results of 11 million emission tests on diesel cars. Read our full story on the cuts here: First Toblerone, now Maltesers: And here\u2019s a reminder of the Toblerone controversy: Lord Wolfson, chief executive of Next, has told consumers to expect price rises on the high street from January, as the weak pound starts to feed through. He told Bloomberg Television: I would expect it to begin to come through January next year. And really that inflationary bubble will last all year. But it is a one off bubble, it\u2019s not likely to affect us the following year. It\u2019s not likely to affect retail anything like as much as the devaluation of the pound. So the pound\u2019s fallen 15, 20%. We\u2019re expecting prices at most to go up 5% but I\u2019m expecting a bit less than that. And the reason for that is because there\u2019s a lot of spare capacity in factories in the far east and retail is constantly looking for new and better sources of supply, cheaper sources of supply. So I think we\u2019ll be able to mitigate most of the currency fall. But we\u2019re still looking at prices rises around 4-5%. JCB\u2019s Staffordshire HQ hit by mini Tornado My colleague Sean Farrell reports: Workers at JCB\u2019s world headquarters in Staffordshire were stunned on Thursday when a mini tornado caused a wall to collapse and windows to crash to the ground. Production of diggers stopped after the tornado tore into the side of the factory. No one was injured in the incident and the factory was back up and running after 30 minutes. The damaged areas have been cordoned off. JCB\u2019s assembly manager, Richard Williams, said: \u201cI was about 30 yards away at the time and I heard an enormous crash. I turned around and saw the wall and the windows had come out and a big whirlwind of leaves and branches blowing around outside. Luckily no one was in the vicinity at the time.\u201d The JCB factory was one of the sites hit by winds of more than 70mph that battered Staffordshire, Shropshire and mid-Wales. Trees were uprooted and buildings were damaged as a series of small, brief tornadoes left a trail of destruction. David Rees, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, says the bonds sell-off in emerging markets is likely to continue: Dollar-denominated government bonds have suffered disproportionately during the emerging market sell-off since Donald Trump won the US presidential election. We expect dollar-denominated bonds to continue to underperform equities and currencies. Whereas equity prices have fallen by 3.5% on average in local currency terms since the November 8th election, and currencies have depreciated by a similar amount against the US dollar, dollar- denominated sovereign bonds have registered losses of nearly 4.5% on average. The upshot is that we believe the underperformance of hard currency bonds will continue. Global bonds are on course for their biggest two-week loss in more than a quarter of a century, as rising inflation dampens demand. Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index is set for a 4% loss over the last fortnight - the biggest since at least 1990 according to Reuters. Reuters reports: Donald Trump\u2019s shock win in the US election last week has stoked bets that economic plans under a Trump administration would boost business investments and spending while firing up inflation. Rising inflation erodes the value of bonds which offer set interest rates over their lifespan. Ben Broadbent, the deputy governor of the Bank of England responsible for monetary policy, has been speaking in London. He insisted the prolonged spell of ultra-low interest rates had not driven a rise in inequality in the UK. The Bank has been under fire in recent weeks by critics who claim the loose monetary stance has hurt some households. Here is the full report from my colleague Katie Allen who attended the event: Europe\u2019s major markets are now firmly in the red: A strong dollar is hitting mining stocks, and Italian banks are also among the biggest losers. Nerves are mounting in Italy ahead of next month\u2019s referendum on constitutional reform. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has said he will resign if he loses the referendum. Lord Jim O\u2019Neill, the former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, is joining the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, set up by the former chancellor George Osborne who chairs the thinktank. Not an entirely surprising appointment. The two men worked together in government, after O\u2019Neill was given a peerage and appointed to Osborne\u2019s Treasury team last year with responsibility for the northern powerhouse project. (The idea is to drive investment and growth in the north.) O\u2019Neill stepped down as a Treasury minister in September and resigned the Conservative whip amid reported tensions over Theresa May\u2019s approach to China. The high-profile businessman is known for coining the phrase \u201cBrics\u201d, an acronym for the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. O\u2019Neill said: Having been involved in its inception, I have always been a huge supporter of the Northern Powerhouse and through my participation in the Northern Powerhouse Partnership I look forward to continuing to play a role in ensuring that the original vision becomes a reality. In a second appointment to the NPP, the former director general of the CBI John Cridland will also join the board. Osborne said: Today is a milestone in the creation of our Northern Powerhouse Partnership. Our first board meeting, here in Sheffield, brings together some of the north\u2019s biggest employers and civic leaders to see how we can work together to create a powerhouse. I am delighted that Jim O\u2019Neill and John Cridland are also joining the board and getting involved in the Northern Powerhouse Partnership. They are both hugely regarded figures across the North and two of the brightest and the best when it comes to thinking proactively about how to drive transformational change for the region. Here is what Draghi had to say on eurozone inflation: Despite the recovery in growth and employment, the persisting output gap is still keeping inflation dynamics weak. The October inflation rate stood at 0.5%. While this marks the highest level recorded in almost two years, it remains far below the ECB\u2019s objective [of below, but close to 2%]. And while we expect headline inflation to continue rising over the coming months, much of this increase will be driven by statistical factors related to the mechanical unwinding of the extreme oil price declines a year ago. We do not yet see a consistent strengthening of underlying price dynamics. Draghi said recovery in the eurozone\u2019s economy was still underpinned by support from the central bank: The euro area recovery still relies to a considerable degree on accommodative monetary policy. The recovery in credit is being facilitated by a more resilient banking sector, but the impetus comes from our monetary policy. The eurozone\u2019s economy grew by 2% in 2015, and the International Monetary Fund is predicting growth of 1.7% this year followed by 1.5% in 2017. Draghi\u2019s speech strikes a decidedly dovish and cautious note. He suggests that while the eurozone is in reasonable shape, key risks to the recovery remain. We have ... every reason to be more confident in the strength of the recovery than we were one year ago. But we cannot be sanguine over the economic outlook. Besides the geopolitical risks that remain prevalent, there are indeed three factors that warrant caution: the profitability of euro area banks, the relative weakness of inflation dynamics, and the dependence of the recovery on accommodative monetary policy. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has given a clear signal that policymakers will continue to support the eurozone economy with monetary stimulus. Giving a keynote speech at the European Banking Congress in Frankfurt, Draghi said policy would remain lose amid weak inflationary pressures. Even if there are many encouraging trends in the euro area economy, the recovery remains highly reliant on a constellation of financing conditions that, in turn, depend on continued monetary support. The ECB will continue to act, as warranted, by using all the instruments available within our mandate to secure a sustained convergence of inflation towards a level below, but close to 2%. The FTSE 100 is slightly down in early trading, after closing up 45 points or 0.7% on Thursday. Elsewhere in Europe, markets are mixed. Nerves persist in Italy, where bond yields are sharply higher as political concerns rise to the fore ahead of next month\u2019s referendum. The scores so far: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 6,783 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.3% at 10,716 France\u2019s CAC: +0.2% at 4,538 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1% at 16,376 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.2% at 8,698 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.2% at 341 Holger Schmieding, economist at the German bank Berenberg, says the ECB won\u2019t be in any hurry to follow the Fed and tighten monetary policy. Pundits including us expect the ECB to prolong its current \u20ac80 billion monthly asset purchases by at least three and more likely six months beyond March 2017 before finally starting to taper, announcing that decision to extend purchases at its 8 December meeting. In addition, the ECB will likely make some technical changes to its programme to broaden the scope of eligible (German) paper without changing the capital key distribution of purchases or breaking new ground by venturing into purchases of major new asset classes such as bank bonds or equities. The euro against the dollar over the past year: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The dollar\u2019s gain is the euro\u2019s loss, with strength in the US currency pushing the euro below $1.06 for the first time in almost a year. It is currently trading at $1.0596. The single\u2019s bloc\u2019s currency is suffering its longest run of losses since 1999, when it first launch as an accounting currency, according to the FT\u2019s analysis of Bloomberg data. The dollar\u2019s latest boost comes from Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, who hinted to Congress on Thursday that another rate hike in December was on the cards. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, is due to give a speech in Frankfurt shortly. Investors will listen closely for his views on the current outlook for the eurozone, and any hints on possible changes to monetary policy.",

It could absolutely collapse next week as the dollar appreciates further. The market seems convinced that the Fed will hike interest rates in December and tighten its belt further in 2017. Meanwhile the ECB and other major central banks are widely expected to maintain their current extremely loose policy stances intact well into 2017 at the very least. As such, the dollar is getting stronger across the board, but especially against currencies where the central bank is still uber-dovish such as the euro...</p> <p>To get anywhere near parity, the euro/dollar will first need to break and then hold below the prior support around the 1.0460/1.0525 area. As things stand, this looks like a good possibility... However, as always, it is worth remembering that the markets are forward-looking. As such, the outlook for the diverging monetary policy stances in the Eurozone and US may already be priced in, if not fully then maybe partially. But price needs to confirm this view by creating a distinct reversal pattern. Until and unless such a technical signal is generated, the path of least resistance remains to the downside.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a9c03de278fee4e8bea4b5ba59ee05f124a9b75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a9c03de278fee4e8bea4b5ba59ee05f124a9b75/0_0_1105_798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The euro against the dollar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"722\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The euro against the dollar</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: eSignal and Forex.com</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582f2dd1e4b090fc812828ee\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-18T17:06:38.814Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets drift lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Despite a record high in the US tech-heavy market Nasdaq (subsequently reversed), European shares have ended the week on a downbeat note.

If you leave that you then have to have some sort of hard border on how you can check up things like, for example Argentinian beef. Say that beef was infected by some bacteria and if you didn\u2019t have border checks then that meat could come into Northern Ireland, go across the border into the south and that would mean it was now inside the EU. Some people talk about using electronic tagging to track goods including that meat but I just cannot see how that would work. If we were to leave the Customs Union then a hard border even for those practical reasons would be inevitable.\u201d</p> <p>Ramsey said the Northern Ireland Executive\u2019s pursuit of a 12.5% corporation tax rate to compete with the Irish Republic in terms of foreign direct investment may be redundant once the entire UK including the region exits the EU.</p> <p>He said that when the power sharing government in Belfast embarked on its campaign for low corporation tax \u201cbeing in Europe was a given.\u201d All this changed once the UK voted for Brexit in June, he said.</p> <p>The Ulster Bank chief economist said: \u201cIn many ways perhaps we in Northern Ireland thought 12.5% was a one way process in which the rate would attract foreign direct investment into the region. But the rules of the game have been changed with some foreign corporations who are already here reconsidering their position about staying here. In my view the impact of a potential 12.5% corporation tax rate has been weakened significantly. If you were a foreign investor thinking of coming here you would think, \u2018hold on a minute there is no clarity about Northern Ireland and Europe whereas there is clarity in the Irish Republic.\u2019 On that basis they would decide to locate in the Republic as low corporation tax inside the EU is already guaranteed.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582f073de4b090fc81282812\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-18T13:56:53.744Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fed's Bullard leaning towards December rate hike</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US, on the other hand, is set for a rate hike in December, most economists believe.

      "bodyText": "The sale of Staples has taken the number of UK retail jobs affected by business failures this year to almost 26,000 \u2013 the highest figure since 2012 when the sector was still reeling from the recession. With six weeks of 2016 remaining, 22 medium and large retailers employing 25,933 people have failed, according to the Centre for Retail Research (CRR). The number of jobs affected is almost four times the 6,845 for all of last year and exceeds the 25,140 total for 2013. The CRR figures do not take into account businesses that fail but are then revived under new owners. The numbers also exclude job cuts by companies that are still trading, including Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer, which is cutting up to 500 head office jobs and closing stores. Staples, the struggling US stationery chain, has sold its UK business to Hilco Capital for a nominal sum. Hilco, the retail restructuring firm which revived HMV, will take on Staples\u2019s 106 stores, which employ more than 1,100 people. The stores will remain open while Hilco decides what to do with the business, though the Staples brand will be phased out in the next six months. Staples is the latest familiar retail name to face difficulties this year, after the collapse of BHS and Austin Reed, as well as the planned closure of US retailers American Apparel and Banana Republic\u2019s UK stores. Exhibit, a fashion chain in Northern Ireland employing 100 staff, went into administration last month after 33 years. Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the CRR, said the rate of failure was alarming because the economy had been growing for the past few years and businesses shutting now had made it through the recession, which was meant to have cleared out redundant or inefficient operators. He said CRR had added almost 1,500 jobs to the 2016 running total since the end of October and that this was worrying so close to Christmas, the peak trading period for most retailers. \u201cThough there are fewer companies failing than a few years ago the impact is a lot bigger because the chains that are going have managed to survive since the recession. Many of them are quite large or they are people who, after years of clinging on for dear life, are saying it\u2019s not worth bothering any more. \u201cPeople closing before Christmas is also a really bad sign because Christmas is where you make your profits so if you\u2019re saying it\u2019s not worth carrying on for a couple of months that is a bad signal.\u201d High streets face multiple pressures as consumers buy more goods online and shift their often diminished spending power from physical goods to leisure activity such as eating out and holidays. High business rates and other costs, which have risen faster than spending, have made matters worse. Bamfield said: \u201cThis is the biggest change we have seen in retail in such a short period of time.\u201d The worst year for retailers in the past decade was 2008, when 54 companies, including Woolworths, failed affecting almost 75,000 jobs. Retail jobs affected by business failures fell to fewer than 11,000 in 2010 but rose again to more than 48,000 in 2012 before easing as the economy picked up.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The first signs that the buy-to-let boom could be coming to an end have emerged in figures from the Nationwide building society, which showed that lending to landlords went into the reverse over the past six months. Nationwide\u2019s buy-to-let subsidiary, the Mortgage Works, lent \u00a32.8bn in the six months to September 2016, down from \u00a32.9bn in the same period a year earlier. The lender cited new affordability tests brought in ahead of changes to tax relief from April next year, which have made it more difficult for potential landlords to snap up properties. \u201cThe buy-to-let sector is going through a period of substantial change resulting from new rules on landlord taxation [and] guidance on underwriting and affordability standards,\u201d said Nationwide chief executive Joe Garner. Nationwide told buy-to-let borrowers in April that they could only borrow up to 75% of a property\u2019s value, down from 80%, and that the rental income had to be at least 145% of the monthly mortgage repayment, up from 125%. In higher priced property markets, such as London, the new tests have made buy-to-let borrowing prohibitively expensive. Santander and Barclays have already announced tougher rules on buy-to-let lending, and Lloyds Banking Group subsidiary Birmingham Midshires, the biggest lender to landlords, is to introduce new criteria for higher rate taxpayers over the next few weeks. Nationwide said UK house prices should remain subdued over the coming year as the Brexit process unfurls, but it does not predict a fall. \u201cA less certain economic outlook may soften demand but prices will continue to be supported by low interest rates and limited supply of new homes,\u201d it said, predicting rises of between 3% and 6% over the next year. The society\u2019s underlying profits dropped significantly in the half year from \u00a3802m to \u00a3615m, a fall of 23%. It blamed a fall in net interest income, stiff competition in the mortgage market and rising costs. Nationwide, which is a mutual and does not have to report to shareholders, said it consciously took the decision to lower profits so it could \u201cstand by our members\u201d. \u201cWe are motivated by a sense of social purpose, and we exist to serve our members and the wider society,\u201d said Garner. The society said that in the six months to September its gross mortgage lending was up 17% to \u00a317.5bn, with its net lending hitting a record of \u00a36bn. It said it accounted for one-third of net lending in the UK over the past five years. Despite record low interest rates, savers have continued to increase deposits at the society. It said member balances increased by \u00a34.7bn, compared with \u00a32.6bn in the same period last year, and that it pays about 0.25% more interest on average compared with rivals, worth \u00a3380m extra to customers. New rules on seven-day switching have helped the society to challenge the traditional high street banks. Nationwide opened 377,000 new current accounts, up 36%, giving it a 15.8% market share of new account openings in the UK. It is also trialling new branches in communities left without banking services, with a new opening in Glastonbury where screens will enable customers to talk to remotely based advisers. Amid the widening debate over precarious working conditions for millions of people in modern Britain, the society said that apart from being one of the earliest to promise a \u201cliving wage\u201d to all staff it is also providing a \u201cliving pension\u201d. Staff who pay in 7% of salary into their pension will receive a 16% contribution from Nationwide. Most standard pension schemes offer a basic company contribution of about 6% of salary.",

The company reported a 6% rise in half year profits to \u00a322.8m, but said total beer and cider volumes fell by 4%. The half started badly, due to a poor start to the summer season and worries about the EU referendum, but good weather in August and September gave a lift to its business. And it faced a tough comparison, thanks to the boost given to business by the Rugby World Cup in 2015. Trading since the end of the half had been good, the company said, althoughit admitted that beer volumes continued to decline. Its managed pubs business, the largest contributor to profits, outperformed the market. During the half, it bought two well known London pubs, the Gun in Docklands and the Half Moon in Herne Hill. But the company warned of possible problems ahead. Chief executive Simon Emeny said: There is no doubt the UK economy is facing some significant challenges. The impact of increases in business rates and the National Living Wage, combined with uncertainty around the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, make for changing times ahead. However Fuller\u2019s has a long-term stategic vision, a solid balance sheet and a predominantly freehold estate. It said Christmas bookings were strong, but the overall cautious tone has pushed Fuller\u2019s shares down 1% to 980p. On staffing, it said it would cover the cost of applying for a permanent residence card for any EU or EEA nationals who had worked for the company for five years or more: We are very proud of the cosmopolitan workforce we have in our business and we have a clear position of supporting and rewarding the loyalty shown by all our team members, regardless of nationality. On the results Numis analyst Tim Barrett said they were in line with forecasts, with an impressive second quarter: The managed estate reported like for like growth of 3.4% which implied more than 5% growth in the second quarter. A small margin decline in the managed business (-20bp) was offset by cost efficiencies elsewhere. Overall earnings per share growth of 6% reflects the strong positioning of Fuller\u2019s estate. In the next 12 months the industry faces several cost headwinds but given the strength of the first half our 2017 forecasts are unchanged.",

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen is to axe 30,000 jobs as part of a restructuring designed to help the German carmaker recover from the diesel emissions scandal. The cuts will be in the core VW business, as opposed to its other brands such as Porsche, Audi and Seat, and 23,000 will be in Germany. There will also be job cuts in Brazil, Argentina and North America. Matthias M\u00fcller, the chief executive, said the move was the \u201cbiggest reform package in the history of our core brand\u201d. VW is still reeling from the emissions scandal that engulfed the company last year. The company admitted that 11m diesel cars had been fitted with software that allowed them to cheat tests. It has set aside billions of euros to deal with the crisis, which led to VW\u2019s first annual loss in more than 20 years, but the carmaker faces a string of legal and regulatory cases worldwide. VW has agreed a settlement in the US to pay up to $15bn (\u00a312bn) to authorities and owners of some of the nearly 500,000 affected vehicles. Herbert Diess, the head of the VW brand, said the cuts would make the carmaker \u201cleaner and more efficient\u201d. The company intends to shift more investment and resources into developing electric cars and wants to launch 30 electric-powered vehicles by 2025. \u201cIt\u2019s a major step forward and undoubtedly one of the biggest in the history of the company,\u201d Diess said. \u201cI am very sorry for those affected, but the situation of the brand at the moment gives us little room for manoeuvre. \u201cWe are tackling the problems at the root, even if it\u2019s painful. Many didn\u2019t think we could do it. Today, we have shown that Volkswagen can and will change.\u201d The cuts were announced at a press conference at VW\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg on Friday, after weeks of talks with trade unions. Bernd Osterloh, a senior employee representative, welcomed the fact that \u201cthe next generation of electric vehicles will be made here in Germany, not abroad\u201d. VW employs 600,000 people worldwide, including 120,000 in Germany. This is far more than its rivals Toyota and General Motors, with whom it battles for the position of the biggest carmaker in the world. Toyota employs roughly 350,000 people while GM has 200,000. Analysts said the cuts helped VW to rethink its strategy as well as shore up its balance sheet. Christian Stadler, professor of strategic management at the Warwick Business School, said: \u201cThis is not just about cutting costs because of the emissions scandal but moving to a new strategy in a rapidly changing car market. \u201cThere are three reasons behind this shedding of jobs, which will have been agreed with the unions beforehand and will come mostly from early retirements as 23,000 are in Germany. \u201cFirst Volkswagen is responding to the potential lawsuit tsunami heading its way from all over the world due to the emissions scandal, with $18bn of fines looming in the US alone. \u201cSecondly, Volkswagen has fallen behind in terms of profit margin per vehicle against its rivals, even lagging behind Peugeot. \u201cThirdly, electronic vehicles are the future and they need less people to build them in the production process. \u201cChina \u2013 the biggest car market in the world \u2013 has announced it will bring in an e-vehicle quota starting in 2018, where 8% of all vehicles sold in China have to be e-vehicles, and that will rise to 12%. It means VW would have to sell 60,000 e-vehicles in China by 2018, and hybrids only represent half a point. That is a huge undertaking.\u201d Stadler also said that Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, a shareholder in VW, had been putting pressure on the carmaker to become more environmentally friendly. Shares in VW dipped 0.8% following the announcement and remain roughly a third lower than before the emissions scandal emerged. Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan, said that VW needed to go further. \u201cThe deal may be the best the company could negotiate with labour but it\u2019s not a victory for either side,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cThe cuts are too small to make VW cost competitive with Toyota and other global rivals.\u201d TCI, the British hedge fund that has criticised the management of VW and pushed for change, said the company now needed to actually make the cuts. Ben Walker, partner at TCI, said: \u201cThey\u2019ve just to deliver now. It\u2019s easy to talk. They now have to deliver and execute.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Fund management firms are facing a shakeup after the City regulator published a hard-hitting critique of the \u201csustained, high profits\u201d the industry has earned from savers and pension funds over the years. The major companies, which manage \u00a37bn of assets, should charge a single fee, the Financial Conduct Authority said, so investors could see how much they were being charged. The regulator said it would also consult on the need for a competition investigation into the consultants that advise pension funds on which fund manager to select to look after their assets. It is the first time the FCA has used its powers to suggest a recommendation to the Competition and Markets Authority. It recommended a review into the investment consultant market in which three firms, Aon Hewitt, Mercer and Wallis Towers Watson, have a 60% market share. Much of the FCA\u2019s year-long review was into the wider asset management industry which it found left investors unclear about the objectives of funds, and performance which was not always measured against an appropriate benchmark. Andrew Bailey, the FCA chief executive, said: \u201cAsset managers are responsible for the savings of millions of people in the UK, making decisions which affect their financial wellbeing both now and in the future. In today\u2019s world of persistently low interest rates, it is vital that we do everything possible to enable people to accumulate and earn a return on their savings which can meet their lifetime needs. \u201cWe want to see greater transparency so that investors can be clear about what they are paying and the impact charges have on their returns. We want asset managers to ensure investors receive value for money through pursuing energetically their duty to act in their customers\u2019 best interests. The remedies that we are proposing today aim to achieve these outcomes.\u201d As well as suggesting an \u201call-in fee\u201d so investors can see what they are paying, the FCA suggested ideas aimed at retail investors who it said needed better ways to identify which fund was right for them. Retail investors should find it easier to move into better-value funds, the FCA said. Martin Gilbert, the chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management, said the FCA\u2019s report would bring a \u201csense of urgency, to confronting some key industry issues impacting customers\u201d. Its shares were little changed on the stock market. Publication of the report removed the uncertainty that had been clouding the industry for the past year while the review was under way. \u201cAlthough the FCA\u2019s findings present some serious challenges for the asset management industry, the report puts an end to a source of speculation and uncertainty that has been the leading worry for asset managers, even with Brexit,\u201d said Owen Lysak, a senior associate at Clifford Chance. The UK leaving the EU could have significant consequences for the asset management industry, which uses a \u201cpassport\u201d to operate across the current 28 member states.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A long spell of ultra-low interest rates has not driven a rise in inequality in the UK, the deputy governor of the Bank of England has said, rebuffing criticism that central bank policy had hurt some households. Ben Broadbent also reinforced the recent message from the Bank that it would tread carefully in setting interest rates over the coming months as it deals with a trade-off between keeping inflation in check and supporting the economy after the Brexit vote. Broadbent\u2019s comments on monetary policy and inequality follow Theresa May\u2019s remarks earlier this year that there had been \u201csome bad side-effects\u201d from low interest rates and quantitative easing, which involves central banks pumping electronic money into the financial system. Broadbent used his speech to outline why he thought the evidence showed low rates had not driven a rise in income inequality, given that most income came from wages and not assets. Furthermore, on the asset side too there was little effect on inequality from loose monetary policy, he said. \u201cIn the UK, summary measures of income inequality \u2013 in particular the so-called Gini coefficient \u2013 have been broadly unchanged since real interest rates began to decline a quarter of a century ago,\u201d Broadbent said in a speech to the Society of Business Economists\u2019 annual conference. He also noted the real price of shares, which tend to be held by richer households, was no higher than it was 20 years ago and nor was it any higher than before the financial crisis. Turning to the housing market, he found house prices, which account for a much larger share of household wealth in aggregate, \u201cdid a lot better over this period\u201d of two decades. But real house prices were no higher now than they were a decade ago. \u201cAnd the result is that, whichever measure you use, the distribution of wealth has been broadly flat over that period,\u201d he said. Broadbent concluded the monetary policy committee (MPC), which sets interest rates and on which he sits, was not having a significant impact on inequality. \u201cI doubt that any independent decision of monetary authorities, the MPC included, has that much bearing on the behaviour of real asset prices over long periods of time, or any distributional consequences that follow,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the only reason for raising these issues, therefore, is the apparent concern that the opposite is true \u2013 that looser monetary policy, unconventional policy in particular, is having material and lasting effects on the distributions of income and wealth. I don\u2019t think the evidence gives much support to that view.\u201d Broadbent also addressed the pound\u2019s sharp fall since June\u2019s vote to leave the EU. After official figures this week showed significant rises in manufacturers\u2019 costs and the prices they charge their customers, Broadbent noted the likely impact on inflation from the weaker pound. Referring to sterling\u2019s fall, he said: \u201cOver time, this is likely to put significant upward pressure on import prices and, because around 30% of consumption is imported, consumer prices as well.\u201d Broadbent noted, however, that reacting to a likely rise in inflation by raising interest rates could be \u201crather costly in terms of unemployment \u2026 This is not what the MPC is meant to do.\u201d But he stopped short of giving a steer on where that left the MPC, which hinted in its last set of economic forecasts that it would keep policy on hold for some time to come, with interest rates at a record low of 0.25%. Broadbent said: \u201cWe can tolerate high inflation because the alternative is a larger rise in unemployment, and weaker wage growth. Put another way, we expect to have to accept those things (to some extent) in order to prevent inflation from rising further above the target. That\u2019s the unavoidable nature of the trade-off that monetary policy occasionally faces.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The strong dollar, boosted by US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s hints on Thursday of a December rate rise, has hit commodity companies, particularly gold and silver. So precious metal miners are leading the market lower, with gold down more than 1%. The metal is priced in the US currency so is sensitive to dollar movements, and at the same time investors are turning away from its haven status, believing Donald Trump\u2019s expansionary plans could boost corporate profits and equities. Randgold Resoures is the biggest falling in the FTSE 100, down 380p at \u00a357.05 despite unveiling a joint venture with Newcrest in the Cote d\u2019Ivoire. Mexican precious metal miner Fresnillo has fallen 64p to \u00a313.24, while among the mid-caps gold miner Centamin has lost 7.2p to 132.7p. It is not just precious metal miners. Antofagasta has fallen 24.5p to 663p and Rio Tinto is down 77.5p at 2943.5p. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently down 47.05 points at 6747.66. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said The UK index wasn\u2019t helped by a sluggish commodity sector; the greenback\u2019s surge has pushed Brent Crude under $46 per barrel and gold back towards $1200 per ounce, in the process dragging the FTSE\u2019s oil and mining stocks in the red. Rolls-Royce continues to slide in the wake of its update this week, down another 21p at 678p as Emirates Airline said it was having technical issues with new engines for the A380. Among the risers Intertek is up 54p at \u00a332.42 ahead of the testing equipment group\u2019s next update, despite Deutsche Bank cutting its target price from \u00a335 to \u00a334. The bank did raise its earnings per share forecast thanks to benefits from a weaker pound, saying: We are cutting our full year organic growth forecast from 1.0% to 0.4%. This implies ~0.4% in the second half versus. 0.5% in the first. We cut our view of a potential recovery next year from 2.5% growth to 1.4% growth due to ongoing weakness in Oil &amp; Gas related activity. Due to weakness in Oil &amp; Gas we are also nudging down our operating margin forecasts by 10bps in both years, despite some benefit from acquisitions. Our forecasts imply a full year EBITA margin decline of 10bps versus guidance of a broadly stable margin. Due to further significant foreign exchange changes since we last updated our forecasts our earnings per share forecast for 2017 now rises by 10% to 178p. We are now broadly in line with consensus. Software specialist Sage is up 6.5p at 681.5p as Goldman Sachs raised its target price from 850p to 870p. Among the mid-caps Electrocomponents has jumped 10% to a 14 year high of 408.1p, after the electronic component distributor raised its full year cost saving target from \u00a325m to \u00a330m and said its half year profits were up 76%. Liberum analysts said: These results should provide investors with a great deal of comfort and provide clear evidence of the upside potential of the group\u2019s self-help strategy...Management have also provided a positive outlook for both revenues and margins and we would expect upgrades to consensus of 8-10% for the full year 2017.",
