The British Retail Consortium's monthly report suggested sales were up 4.2% on a like-for-like basis in April on a year earlier as bank holiday shoppers bought furniture and snapped up clothing to suit the warmer weather. But the numbers were distorted by the timing of Easter, which fell in March last year. The same holiday timing effect saw sales fall according to the report for March. Taking the last three months together to iron out distortions, like-for-like sales grew 0.3%, the weakest performance since December 2012. The main drag came from food, with sales falling against a backdrop of supermarket discounting. Without food, like-for-like sales rose 2.2% over the three months to April. \"Price wars may be good news for consumers but mean that grocers have to urgently rethink business models to maintain margins,\" said David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, the report's co-author. Looking ahead, he predicted consumers would continue to watch their spending closely. \"After splashing out at Easter shoppers may be more restrained in the forthcoming months as they keep a keen eye on cash. However, if we have fine weather and the good economic news keeps coming, this should give retailers the momentum they need to drive sales of summer stock,\" he said.",

Elected on a platform of soaking the rich, Hollande in power is all about spending cuts, tax breaks for business, liberalising labour laws and preparing the French people for the disciplines of globalisation. New Hollande, New Labour, in other words. There are limits, though. Hollande and his ministers made it clear that they were unhappy about the US company GE taking over the energy division of industrial group Alstom, dismissing the bid as \"not good enough\". That was even though the board of Alstom had voted for the deal to go ahead, which it probably still will once GE has agreed extra concessions on jobs. The case illustrates a fundamental difference with the UK. In France, the default position is to oppose foreign takeovers of companies deemed strategically important unless there is a good reason for them going ahead. That is especially so if the bidder is from the US, where the legal system makes hostile takeovers from non-American companies difficult. Over here, the authorities have only tended to stand in the way of a foreign takeover if there is a good reason for it not going ahead. In France, the bar is set high, in the UK it is set low. Which is why Pfizer must have expected its proposed takeover of AstraZeneca to be simply a case of getting the price right. The idea that there might be any Gallic-style political objection to the bid would not really have featured on a list of serious threats to a successful deal. Yet the mooted takeover has caused political waves. In part, that is because the transaction is so palpably about reducing Pfizer's tax bill. In part, it is because nobody really trusts Pfizer to keep its promises about jobs and research and development. In part, it is because pharma is one of the few manufacturing sectors where Britain retains a global presence and policymakers are worried about a company that accounts for almost 9% of UK R&amp;D being controlled from the other side of the Atlantic. No bad thing, either. Labour is solidly against the takeover. Vince Cable says the future of Britain is as a knowledge centre, not a tax haven.

It was so competitive,\" recalls Samba. Five years on, the 27-year-old Londoner is glad the downturn pushed her to set up her own business and become part of a generation of young entrepreneurs. Labour market experts say the trend shows how fast-changing the world of work is, but unions have cautioned that it is creating an insecure and less well-rewarded workforce. Official figures published on Wednesday are expected to show Britain's unemployment rate falling further to 6.8%. Self-employment has risen rapidly, helping to drive the improvement in the overall figure, but the jobless rate for the young is still predicted to be several times higher than average. After running sports sessions for children and adults, Samba found people were coming to her for tailor-made courses. Within a year of leaving university she had set up her own company, Run Fun Starz. \"If someone had offered me my dream job, I probably would have turned it down because I was young. I wanted to see if I could make this work and I wouldn't have much to lose,\" she says. Her business, which goes into small companies to set up fitness programmes for owners and staff , broke even last year. Samba has moved out of her parents' home and is expecting to hire her first employee soon. In a report last month, the TUC noted that pensioners, part-time workers and \"odd-jobbers\" were the fastest-growing groups among the new self-employed workforce. It found that the number of people starting their own businesses had fallen in recent years, and that the rise in self-employment was due to an increase in insecure employment such as subcontracting. Richard Exell, the TUC's senior labour market officer, points out that self-employment is often associated with lower levels of investment, low productivity and lower pay. \"If someone is voluntarily choosing that and it's their dream or it's the slow, hard start of something that is going to make a difference in the long run, then it may well be worth paying that price,\" he says. \"But that's not usually the case.\" There is also anecdotal evidence that the rising cost of a degree is prompting school-leavers to try to set up on their own. But a significant number of young people are choosing self-employment to fill what they see as specific gaps in the market, according to a new report from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. \"You could say that's because of the crisis and that they didn't have other options, but one way to see it is that many young people have become disillusioned \u2026 and want to take things into their own hands and be in control,\" says the CIPD's research adviser, Claire McCartney, who authored the report. Produced in partnership with the education charity Young Enterprise, it concludes that the school system has failed to keep up with changes in the world of work. It highlights a \"big gap between those who aspire to start up their own businesses and those who actually do\" and calls for enterprise education to be made a mandatory part of the curriculum. Young Enterprise says that against the backdrop of rising youth unemployment it has seen growing demand for the start-up programme it runs in universities. This helps students set up and run their own company for an academic year while still studying. The charity's chief executive, Michael Mercieca, believes the rise in young entrepreneurship can help improve social mobility and dismisses the perception that a large amount of money is needed to start up any business. \"What we have found through students participating in our programmes is that it's possible to start making a profit from just a small amount of money,\" he says. \"However, it can certainly take a while before a decent income can be earned from the business, meaning low pay in the initial stages is a concern.\" That has been the experience of 24-year-old Jason Gibbs, who launched the website Comparetheuni.com with a fellow law graduate in 2012. Gibbs took other jobs to pay his bills while working on the site, despite raising \u00a320,000 from angel investors. The venture is taking off, with revenues from advertisers and from universities who pay to add premium content, but Gibbs says he still works more hours than most graduates. \"When you have got your own business, even if it's late at night and the business needs work, you do it. Like if a baby wakes up and needs milk, you're going to feed it,\" he says. But he is confident and says other young entrepreneurs should be too. \"We have grown up with technology and we can be the change-makers. A lot of people used to go into business, the corporate world, make some money and then come out and start a business. Now people start businesses young,\" he says. \"We have the knowledge and skills when it comes to technology. As a young person you have got nothing to lose.\" Case study When Cicely Elliott-Berry was still at school she decided a degree was not for her \u2013 her future lay in distilling gin. Teachers and friends were pushing her to apply to university, but she wanted to run her own business. Her two brothers and sister felt the same way and now they have set up a distillery and are looking to launch Sibling Gin soon. \"We all opted out of university really. It wasn't for us. For some people it's an obvious choice but not for us. We were surrounded by business and pretty much raring to go as soon as we finished school,\" says the 18-year-old. Her parents run a brewery in Cheltenham and so the siblings are renting a corner. The two eldest, Felix and Clarice, are still in full-time jobs, while Digby, just 15, helps out and will probably join the business when he leaves school, says Cicely. She is working on Sibling Gin full-time but also has a bar job at weekends to top up her income. They are part of the growing number of young people who have turned to self-employment as the labour market has changed. According to one report, there was a 29% rise in firms started by 18- to 25-year-olds during the four years after the recession took hold in 2008. The Simply Business Start-up Index showed the rising number of new businesses set up by young people was in contrast to a wider decline of 8.7% for all start-ups over the same period. Cicely says her decision was more down to her upbringing than the downturn. \"My parents have run the brewery since I was seven,\" she says. \"When we were growing up, we all said what we wanted to do and it was not 'I want to be a hairdresser' but 'I want to own a hairdressers'... If you want a job, you make a job.\" She recommends other young people with a business idea give it a go. \"We were lucky that we have the support of our parents so that we can do something so capital-intensive. But you can set up an online company. You don't have to have a huge amount of money to put into it.\"",

Efterpi Koutzamani, the tribunal\u2019s chief prosecutor, who bravely ordered that a criminal investigation be launched into the activities of the far right Golden Dawn, is believed to be among the addressees.

Mr Sarkozy had hoped his leadership of the Group of 20 summit would cement his standing on the global stage en route to re-election. Instead, everything was falling apart.</p> <p>Greece was imploding politically; Italy, a country too big to bail out, appeared just days away from being cut off from global financial markets; and Ms Merkel, try as Mr Sarkozy and Mr Obama might, could not be convinced to increase German contributions to the eurozone\u2019s \u201cfirewall\u201d \u2013 the \u201cbig bazooka\u201d or \u201cwall of money\u201d they believed had to grow dramatically to fend off attacks by panicking bond traders.</p> <p>Instead, a cornered Ms Merkel threw the French and American criticism back in their faces.

Loans to finance fixed investment continue to fall. Remarkably, the European Banking Authority's latest stress test for the eurozone's banks does not contemplate the possibility of deflation in its adverse scenario. The implication is clear: the banks' capital shortfall will be understated, and the amount of new capital they will be required to raise will be inadequate. If the goal is to restore confidence and get the banking system firing on all cylinders, this is not how to go about it.</p> <p>And everyone knows that Europe's much vaunted banking union is deeply flawed. It creates a single supervisor, but only for the largest banks. It harmonises deposit-insurance coverage but does not provide a common deposit-insurance fund. The resolution mechanism for bad banks is incomprehensible and unworkable. The associated resolution fund will possess only \u20ac55bn (\u00a344bn) of its own capital, whereas European bank liabilities are of the order of \u20ac1tn.</p> <p>Finally, there is that pesky matter of public debt, which is still 90% of eurozone GDP. European officials propose to work this down to their target of 60% over a couple of decades. You read that right.

      "bodyText": "Time to recap: Two top officials have cautioned today that Europe's economic crisis is not over, although their solutions differ somewhat. IMF chief Christine Lagarde renewed her call for the European Central Bank to do more to stimulate the economy, warning that low inflation and weak bank credit must be fought vigorously. She warned: The recovery runs, that's right. Some countries have completed the auxiliary programs successfully. But that does not mean that the crisis is over and our mission accomplished. In addition, the permanently low inflation bring additional risks Lagarde also told German newspaper Handelsblatt that Ukraine needs more financial help, on top of its existing $17bn bailout plan, and could destabilise the world economy ECB vice-president V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio took a different tact - arguing the politicians must do more to deliver growth and fight fears. He said: It is true that crises always open the door to discontent and this crisis is not over yet. Some policy-makers seem too complacent in showing a sense of relief because the situation in Europe has stabilised and turned a corner, since economic growth is resuming, even if at incipient level. This sentiment is not shared by public opinion in many countries. A Bloomberg survey confirmed that Russia and eurozone deflation rank among the biggest concerns for investors today. But stock markets kept climbing, pushing the Dow Jones to another record high - on optimism that Sunday's independence referendum had not The battle for AstraZeneca took another twist, a day before MPs grills unions and bosses from Astra and Pfizer. Pfizer declared that its pledges to protect the UK are 'legally binding', and argued that it boasts an impressive pipeline of drugs of its own. I'll be back tomorrow. Until then, cheers and goodnight. GW Despite worries about Ukraine, investors pushed shares higher again in the wake of last week's hints from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi that the bank might cut interest rates in June or even consider other stimulus measures, writes Nick Fletcher. To reinforce this, the ECB's Ewald Nowotny said a rate cut alone might not be enough to ease concerns about low inflation, and he favoured a package of measures. Sentiment was also helped by comments from China that the country expected stable, albeit lower, economic growth, which pushed up the commodity sector. Overall, the closing scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 0.55% or 37.18 points higher at 6851.75 \u2022 Germany's Dax rose 1.26% to 9702.46 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.37% better at 4493.65 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB added 0.48% to 21,493.67 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 0.76% higher at 10,567.0 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 100 points or 0.6% higher, slightly off its all time high achieved earlier in the session. Over to Greece, where a new poll shows the vast majority would agree with Christine Lagarde\u2019s warning this morning that the crisis was far from over. From Athens Helena Smith, reports: Some 56% of Greeks (more than twice those registered elsewhere in the EU) think the economic situation of their country will get worse over the course of the next 12 months, according to the latest Eurobarometer poll released today. That figure was seven percentage points worse than in November when the European Commission conducted its last poll. Although there was a marginal improvement of three percentage points in the number of Greeks who also thought the economy would get better (16%), a total of 97% believed that the overall state of their country\u2019s finances was bad and 60% (compared to 29%in the rest of the bloc) believed that employment would get worse. At 26.7% Greece currently has the highest jobless rate in the EU with more than half of those under the age of 25 out of work. The survey was conducted in March as Athens\u2019 two-party coalition government, which orchestrated the country\u2019s return to markets last month, began going into overdrive over the \u201csuccess\u201d of the nation\u2019s economic recovery. The issue of possible political instability following this month\u2019s European Parliament poll is also cause for worry with analysts predicting further turmoil if extremists fare well. In a sign of the heightened passions the election is bound to ignite, police announced they had intercepted an envelope addressed to prosecutors at the Supreme Court containing two bullets and a threatening letter this afternoon. Efterpi Koutzamani, the tribunal\u2019s chief prosecutor, who bravely ordered that a criminal investigation be launched into the activities of the far right Golden Dawn, is believed to be among the addressees. According to a senior police source, the letter not only threatened Koutzamani and other senior court officials but their families as well. Police made the announcement hours after the Supreme Court signalled that the neo-nazi organisation would be able to contend the euro parliament poll despite the vast majority of its MPs now being under criminal investigation. The move has raised fears that even if more Golden Mps are incarcerated (six are currently in prison pending trial on charges of operating a criminal gang), they may all ultimately be freed because of delays in the judicial process. Under Greek law, the prosecuted lawmakers have to be tried and sentenced within 18 months of their arrest or have charges against them dropped. One well-briefed insider with access to lawyers representing the MPs, including Golden Dawn\u2019s jailed leader Nikos Michaloliakos, said the deputies saw it as \u201can honour\u201d to be imprisoned and had even ordered copies of Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf to read \u201cin their spare time.\u201d Speaking of the euro crisis, do check out Peter Spiegel's gripping account of the events of 2011 - when Europe teetered on the brink of disaster - in today's FT. It covers key events, such as Greek PM George Papandreou enraging fellow leaders by deciding to hold a referendum on Greece's second bailout. That flirtation with democracy prompted finance minister Evangelos Venizelos to rebel and trigged a technocratic government. \u201cWe have to kill this referendum,\u201d [EC president Jose Manuel] Barroso said. The finance minister agreed almost immediately. Killing the referendum idea would also be the end of Mr Papandreou. And it begins with the story of how the German chancellor was brought to tears by the pressure from France and the US to prop up Italy and Greece, as the debt crisis escalated. To the astonishment of almost everyone in the room, Angela Merkel began to cry. \u201cDas ist nicht fair.\u201d That is not fair, the German chancellor said angrily, tears welling in her eyes. \u201cIch bringe mich nicht selbst um.\u201d I am not going to commit suicide. For those who witnessed the breakdown in a small conference room in the French seaside resort of Cannes, it was shocking enough to watch Europe\u2019s most powerful and emotionally controlled leader brought to tears. But the scene was even more remarkable, those present said, for the two objects of her ire: the man sitting next to her, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and the other across the table, US President Barack Obama. It would be the low point in a brutal, recrimination-filled night, one many participants would recall as the nadir of the three-year eurozone crisis. Mr Sarkozy had hoped his leadership of the Group of 20 summit would cement his standing on the global stage en route to re-election. Instead, everything was falling apart. Greece was imploding politically; Italy, a country too big to bail out, appeared just days away from being cut off from global financial markets; and Ms Merkel, try as Mr Sarkozy and Mr Obama might, could not be convinced to increase German contributions to the eurozone\u2019s \u201cfirewall\u201d \u2013 the \u201cbig bazooka\u201d or \u201cwall of money\u201d they believed had to grow dramatically to fend off attacks by panicking bond traders. Instead, a cornered Ms Merkel threw the French and American criticism back in their faces. If Mr Sarkozy or Mr Obama did not like the way her government ran, they had only themselves to blame. After all, it was their allied militaries that had \u201cimposed\u201d the German constitution on a defeated wartime foe six decades earlier. \u201cIt was the point where clearly the eurozone as we know it could have exploded,\u201d said a member of the French delegation at Cannes. \u201cIt was the feeling [that with] the contagion, at this point, you were on the brink of explosion.\u201d Here's the full piece: How the euro was saved Ukraine developments on the wires: Over on Project Syndicate, Barry Eichengreen writes that Europe still has much work to do, four years after Greece's first bailout was agreed. He points out that, after four years of austerity programmes, there's too little economic demand and limited progress has been made towards boosting competitiveness. And that's not all... Here's a flavour: Meanwhile, Europe's banking crisis is unresolved. Loans to finance fixed investment continue to fall. Remarkably, the European Banking Authority's latest stress test for the eurozone's banks does not contemplate the possibility of deflation in its adverse scenario. The implication is clear: the banks' capital shortfall will be understated, and the amount of new capital they will be required to raise will be inadequate. If the goal is to restore confidence and get the banking system firing on all cylinders, this is not how to go about it. And everyone knows that Europe's much vaunted banking union is deeply flawed. It creates a single supervisor, but only for the largest banks. It harmonises deposit-insurance coverage but does not provide a common deposit-insurance fund. The resolution mechanism for bad banks is incomprehensible and unworkable. The associated resolution fund will possess only \u20ac55bn (\u00a344bn) of its own capital, whereas European bank liabilities are of the order of \u20ac1tn. Finally, there is that pesky matter of public debt, which is still 90% of eurozone GDP. European officials propose to work this down to their target of 60% over a couple of decades. You read that right. Check back to see how they've done in 2034. It's a date... More here: Eurozone's economic troubles are far from over And here's a chart showing how the Dow has climbed pretty steadily since 2009 to today's record high. A few tumbles stand out, though -- including the 2011 slide as the eurozone debt crisis blew up; and jittery trading in 2013 as traders fretted about the Fed tapering its QE programme. The Dow Jones industrial average has hit yet another record high, at the start of trading in Wall Street. The Dow rose around 100 points in early trading to 16683, a gain of 0.6%, as traders in New York show little concern over Sunday's independence referendum vote in Ukraine. Joao Monteiro, analyst at Valutrades, says there are plenty of reasons for caution: ...the threat of civil war in Ukraine, a slowdown in the Chinese economy or deflation in the Eurozone being just three examples - so just how long we have to wait before the opportunistic profit taking starts is something that remains to be seen. Another juicy quote from Christine Lagarde's interview in Handelsblatt, in which she warned that European politicians and central bankers have more work to do (see opening post) Not that Bayern Munich always outperform the rest of Europe.... Over in Switzerland, company bosses are fretting that they could face paying the highest minimum wage in the world. Swiss voters will decide on 18 May whether to introduce a minimum wage rate of nearly $25 an hour. Currently, around two-thirds of people say they oppose the measure - but after surprisingly voting for immigration curbs in February, the result isn't clear. Reuters reports: \"I'm feeling uneasy about the upcoming vote,\" said Ralph Mueller, division head at electronic components maker Schurter. \"We would have to significantly raise the salaries in our factory in Mendrisio, where about 80 of our 100 workers commute from Italy, but we would also have to raise the wages of our higher-paid staff. It would cost about 250,000 francs a year.\" Metals price are also rising today. Nickel has gained 5%, as the prospect of tougher sanctions on Russia (which provides 12% of global production) looms. That means it's up 50% this year - also driven by Indonesia's decision to ban exports of unprocessed Nickel. The copper price has hit a two-month high too, following the news on Friday that Chinese smelters have lowered their exports so they can satisfy internal demand. British government bonds have fallen in value today, pushing up the yield (interest rate) on benchmark 10-year gilts. Traders are anticipating more hawkish words from the Bank of England on Wednesday, in the new Quarterly Inflation Report. That interest rate rise could be sooner than expected, especially if house prices keep rising - although the Bank is more likely to use its macro-prudential tools to rein prices in first. As Stephen Lewis of Monument Securities points out: Mr Carney has stressed time and again that he does not see an interest rate hike as the first line of defence against a potentially destabilising housing boom. And with the BoE expected to upgrade its growth forecasts, the yield on 10-year gilts has hit 2.73% up from 2.68% on Friday night. Speaking of the pharmaceuticals takeover fever -- Allergan, the US medical firm behind botox, has announced it has 'unanimously rejected the $46bn takeover bid from Canadian rival Valeant. Allergan declared that the offer \"substantially undervalued \" it, predicting strong profits and revenue growth as an independent firm (sounding rather like AstraZeneca trying to repel Pfizer). In the complicated web of M&amp;A deals and rumours, Allergan is said to have considered a takeover bid for Shire..... UK pharmaceuticals firm Shire has just announced that it is taking over Lumena Pharmaceuticals, which develops oral therapeutics for rare liver diseases, in the latest sign of consolidation in the industry. Shire says the deal will boost its rare diseases portfolio. It gets Lumena's LUM001 drug -- designed for patients with cholestatic liver disease, to prevent bile acids being recycled back to the liver. LUM001 is currently in Phase II clinical studies. Lumena's CEO, Mike Grey, believes the deal is good news for all sides - especially patients - as Shire helps to bring its drugs to the market. He says: The future of LUM001 as a treatment for rare cholestatic liver diseases looks brighter than ever. Shire has deep rare disease experience, a global infrastructure, and the commercial expertise to deliver LUM001 to patients around the world. A reminder that there can be good takeovers, as well as bad ones.... Shire is paying $260 million in cash up front, plus various \"contingent milestone payments\" related to ongoing clinical trials. European shares have inched higher through the morning, with the FTSEurofirst index now up 0.5%. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, says City traders are relieved that there isn't more political fallout from yesterday's Ukranian independence polls. The uneventful end to the weekend referendums in Ukraine and an upgrade to the mining sector from JP Morgan, have helped investors start the week in a sunnier frame of mind. While the more positive end to the US session on Friday is also helping markets to hold around their current levels. Tensions in Ukraine have not gone away, but traders will be relieved that there has not been a sudden rush by any of the involved parties to praise or condemn the outcome. That might change over the coming days, but for now the quiet reaction has been gratefully received. On that note, Reuters flags up that another vote could be looming: 12-May-2014 11:36 - UKRAINE'S LUHANSK REGION MAY HOLD A REFERENDUM ON JOINING RUSSIA - RIA NEWS AGENCY CITES A SEPARATIST LEADER A top policymaker at the European Central Bank has declared that Europe's economic crisis hasn't ended, echoing Christine Lagarde's warning this morning, and urged politicians to create a climate of hope rather than fear. V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, ECB vice-president, told an audience in Vienna that Europe needs closer integration -- despite the rise in support for eurosceptic parties ahead of the euro elections later this month. Const\u00e2ncio warned that the public do not share the sense of relief that is wafting through the corridors of power. Europe must deliver growth and prosperity to its people. He said: It is true that crises always open the door to discontent and this crisis is not over yet. Some policy-makers seem too complacent in showing a sense of relief because the situation in Europe has stabilised and turned a corner, since economic growth is resuming, even if at incipient level. This sentiment is not shared by public opinion in many countries. It should rather be recognised that adjustment costs across nations and segments of the population could have been more balanced. In this context, it is useful to retain that the legitimacy of Europe has been always much more based on outcomes of growth and prosperity than on values or input legitimacy. Const\u00e2ncio also harked back to the 1930s, when German philosopher Edmund Husserl warned that Europe faced an existential crisis that would either destroy it, or see it reborn. As Const\u00e2ncio put it: And today, Europe seems a tired and aged continent. Declining demography, under the heading of \u201cno children, no immigrants\u201d is historically a sign of a declining civilisation. In these grim years of crisis, our nations, ever more interdependent, have been bound mostly in a community of fear. We now need that European leaders return it into a community of hope. But will they?... Full speech here. So what is Pfizer promising to do it if wins control of AstraZeneca? Here's a reminder: We will establish the combined company\u2019s corporate and tax residence in England AstraZeneca\u2019s substantial R&amp;D innovation hub in Cambridge will be completed Key scientific leadership will be located in the UK 20% of the combined company\u2019s total R&amp;D workforce will be located in the UK going forward We will retain substantial commercial manufacturing facilities at Macclesfield We will locate the European Business Headquarters and European Regulatory Headquarters in the UK At least two AstraZeneca Board Members will be invited to join the combined company\u2019s Board Board meetings for the new company would be held in the UK as appropriate and the new company would be committed to meaningful participation in the UK commercial, economic and social community But there are no concrete guarantees on job cuts, from a company notorious for shuttering its Sandwich R&amp;D plant in 2011. And the pledges only run until 2019: Another eye-catching quote from Pfizer's defence to MPs: With our commitment to foster research and development in the UK, we are matching words with deeds\u2014and we will keep our word. Just in - Pfizer has just published the statement which it will present to the UK parliament tomorrow, when the Business Innovation and Skills committee holds a hearing into the proposed AstraZeneca takeover. The 23-point statement covers the commitments Pfizer has made to the UK government, and recaps some of its recent public statements on the deal. Pfizer insists that those pledges - including to keep 20% of its R&amp;D staff are - \"tangible, legally-binding and represent significant investment in the economy, skilled workforce and scientific knowledge-base of the UK\". The statement concludes with the claim that \"The best science knows no boundaries\". We understand the impact our business has on the communities in which we operate and we also understand that the decisions we make will have important and lasting impacts on the patients we serve.We take our responsibilities to all our stakeholders extremely seriously. We believe that the best science knows no boundaries. By bringing together the capabilities of Pfizer and AstraZeneca, we believe we would create a more efficient engine through which we could better serve patients and society by bringing them important new therapies faster and more efficiently. This will not only benefit the UK, it will benefit everyone. Here's the full statement (pdf): MEMORANDUM FROM PFIZER TO THE BUSINESS, INNOVATION AND SKILLS COMMITTEE AND THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS US pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer has retaliated against claims that it would ruin AstraZeneca's precious drugs pipeline if it succeeded in taking over its UK rival. It has issued video clips of Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer's head of R&amp;D, expounding on Pfizer's track record on drugs development. He pointed to about 300 projects -- citing new products including treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, a medicine for lung cancer and vaccines to protect children against pneumonia. There are a lot of exciting projects moving forward. A couple of years ago we started R&amp;D turnaround. It was a response of R&amp;D to Ian Read's first imperative of fixing the innovative core of the company. We have made great progress.\" Pfizer defends research record ahead of vital week for AstraZeneca takeover Christine Lagarde's concerns about eurozone deflation and the Ukraine crisis (see opening post) are shared by many investors, according to Bloomberg's latest survey. Its Global Investors poll found \"overwhelming concern\" about deflation in the euro zone. About three-quarters of them say it\u2019s a greater threat to the region than inflation. They are also less optimism about the global economy. Here's a flavour: Forty percent of respondents in the survey of Bloomberg customers say the global economy is improving, another 43 percent say it\u2019s stable, and only 12 percent say it\u2019s deteriorating. Still, the enthusiasm has cooled: 59 percent thought the economy was improving in the last edition of the poll, in January; that was the highest reading since the world emerged from recession in 2009. The survey also found that most investors fear the Russian economy is deteriorating, while half believe the eurozone is perking up. More than seven in 10 of those polled say Russia\u2019s economy is weakening, and 45% recommend selling Russian assets in light of the conflict in Ukraine Bloomberg also found that French president Francois Hollande was the most unpopular politician, with just 11% saying they're optimistic about his policies. Putin followed close behind with an optimism vote of 15%, while Greece's Antonis Samaras secured 37%. The most popular leader is Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, about whom 76 percent of respondents were optimistic. Here's the full story: Europe Deflation Risk Seen by 74% in Global Investor Poll Speaking of Ukraine, Moscow has just announced that it 'respects' the will of the people expressed in yesterday's referendums: KREMLIN SAYS RESPECTS WILL OF THE PEOPLE EXPRESSED IN REFERENDUMS IN UKRAINE'S DONETSK AND LUHANSK REGIONS - STATEMENT KREMLIN SAYS OUTCOME OF REFERENDUMS SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN A CIVILISED MANNER WITHOUT VIOLENCE KREMLIN SAYS IT CONDEMNS USE OF FORCE AGAINST CIVILIANS IN EASTERN UKRAINE AIMED AT HINDERING REFERENDUMS The EU, in contrast, has already declared that the poll was illegal, and it won't recognise the result. Analysts say the crisis is weighing on the stock markets today - with Russia's MICEX down 0.4% so far. The other indices are mixed: FTSE 100: up 18 point at 6,833 German DAX: up 21 points at 9,602 French CAC: down 8 point at 4,469 Mining stocks are leading the risers in London, while BSkyB (-2.5%) is the biggest faller - after confirming it is in talks to buy Sky assets in Germany and Italy (story here) Over in Greece, the extreme right-wing Golden Dawn party has been given the green light to run in this month's European Elections, according to local reports. GD has been approved to field candidates, even though top officials are facing charges of murder and extortion. Kathimerini explains that the Greek Supreme Court declined to ban Golden Dawn yesterday.: Nearly all the party's 18 lawmakers are under investigation by Greek justice over serious crimes allegedly committed by the once-fringe party over the past two years, during its rise to prominence. Under Greek law, candidates are only prevented from standing in an election if they are convicted of a crime, not if they are under investigation. A date for the criminal trials has yet to be set. The party's European election list includes none of its parliament deputies. Among its candidates are two retired senior army officers. Meanwhile in the UK, the Confederation of British Industry has added its voice to the chorus of concern over British house prices, saying it is now on 'high alert'. The CBI has also brought forward its forecast for the first UK interest rate, by six months, to the first quarter of 2015. John Cridland, the group's director-general, said: \"We have to remain alert to the risks posed by unsustainable house price inflation, and the [Bank of England's] financial policy committee is poised to act when necessary. We'll hear more from the BoE on Wednesday, when it issues the new quarterly inflation report. More here: CBI on 'high alert' over house prices Christine Lagarde has also urged governments across the Middle East to press on with economic reforms, and to get more women into the jobs market, as her tour of the region continues. Bang on cue, the Bank of France has predicted that the French economy will grow by a meagre 0.2% in the second quarter of this year. That would mean the eurozone's second largest economy would have struggled to grow through the first half of 2014 (French GDP for the first quarter is released on Thursday, and 0.2% growth is also expected). The BoF also reported that French factory bosses are more pessimistic about economic prospects than a month ago. Its business climate index for the industrial sector fell to 98, from 99 in March - the equivalent service sector reading was unchanged at just 94. (100 = the long term average) Christine Lagarde also warned that Ukraine will need more than the $17bn assistance package agreed last month, and warned that the crisis in the region could hurt the global economy hard. She told Handelsblatt that: \"It is a new risk for the global economy.\" \"The crisis in Ukraine is a danger that one whose risk of contagion for other countries can be very difficult to measure or hard to predict. Nevertheless, it can have serious economic consequences. \" The oil price has been inching higher this morning, back over $108 per barrel, after pro-Russian campaigners in East Ukraine claimed a landslide win in an unofficial independence referendum. Ukraine's economy is expected to suffer a deep recession this year, following the breakdown in relations with Russia - the IMF warns the international community to do more: \"Ukraine needs much more than $ 17 billion,\" \"For example, bilateral aid from abroad and financial aid from other international financial institutions. The international community since it has no choice. \" Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Europe's financial crisis is not over, and that the Ukraine crisis could derail the global recovery, Christine Lagarde has warned today, urging against a \"false sense of security\" in the euro area. The managing director of the International Monetary Fund said that weak bank lending, and low inflation rates, posed serious threats to the European recovery. In an interview with Germany's Handelsblatt (online here), Lagarde cautions against undue optimism, just because countries (such as Ireland) have emerged from their bailout programmes. She said: The recovery runs, that's right. Some countries have completed the auxiliary programs successfully. But that does not mean that the crisis is over and our mission accomplished. The crisis will not be over until the flow of credit from banks in Southern Europe is repaired, she argued, adding: In addition, the permanently low inflation bring additional risks Prices rose by just 0.7% across the euro area last month, and are falling in several countries undergoing painful austerity. But that wasn't enough to spur the European Central Bank into fresh stimulus measures last week - although Mario Draghi did hint at action in June, Lagarde renewed her call for the ECB to be bold and decisive: \"Monetary policy in Europe should therefore continue to provide impetus for growth.\" Last week, Draghi warned that the ECB's independence could be threatened if politicians and top officials continue to offer helpful advice. He may not welcome this latest contribution from Washington.... Lagarde also pointed to the dangers posed by Europe's ageing population -- a threat to which Germany is not immune. All countries can do better on this issue, she said, even those at the top of the class. More to follow....",

Interserve keeps National Training Estate Babcock was short-listed on all three contracts and has won nothing. To be fair, two of the three contracts were awarded to the incumbent, and Babcock was not incumbent on any of the first wave of contracts. It is also fair to say that these three contracts are smaller than the next three. [These] are: Central (Central and Eastern), South East and South West. Babcock and Carillion are bidding all three and Interserve is bidding South West and South East, but not Central. We believe that Babcock is well placed to win work on these contracts. Carillion is incumbent on Central and Babcock is incumbent on Eastern, making the new Central contract an interesting battle ground. Interserve is incumbent on South East through its Pride joint venture. Babcock is incumbent on South West.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "CBI on 'high alert' over house prices", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's leading business lobby group has warned that policymakers must be ready to act on unsustainable house price rises in the UK. The CBI said it was on high alert after annual house price inflation reached more than 10% in some areas. It now expects interest rates to rise in the first three months of 2015, six months earlier than it previously predicted and, crucially, before the general election. John Cridland, the group's director-general, said: \"We have to remain alert to the risks posed by unsustainable house price inflation, and the [Bank of England's] financial policy committee is poised to act when necessary. \"Housing has come back under the spotlight as annual house price inflation figures have reached double digits on some measures. While housing transactions are still running almost 30% below their last peak in 2006, they are picking up steadily.\" The business lobby group is expecting house prices to rise by 8.2% this year, and by 5.1% in 2015. Prices rose 3.6% in 2013. It raised its forecasts for economic growth this year and next, and said the recovery was becoming better balanced with a sharp rise in business investment expected. It expects the economy to grow by 3% this year, stronger than an earlier forecast of 2.6%. Next year growth is expected to be 2.7%, compared with an earlier forecast of 2.5%. The CBI warned that \"loose talk\" and anti-business rhetoric in the runup to next May's general election risked damaging investment and derailing the recovery. \"The UK now has more stable economic foundations, and political risks must not jeopardise this. Politicians must be wary of the risk of headline-grabbing policies that weaken investment, opportunity and jobs,\" Cridland said. \"We've got a combination of political risks that we've not had for some while. They range from UK general election to Scottish referendum on independence to the prospect of a referendum on European Union, so that's quite a cocktail of issues.\" He said the message to all parties was to stick with what's working, including a commitment to cut the deficit. The CBI brought forward its expectation for the first rise in interest rates to the first quarter of 2015, when it expects the first 0.25 percentage point rise in rates. It had previously forecast the first rise in rates would come in the third quarter of next year. Rates have been on hold at a record low of 0.5% since March 2009. Cridland said the government's controversial Help to Buy scheme \u2013 blamed by some for creating a new housing bubble \u2013 was not responsible for unsustainable rises in house prices, arguing it was a relatively small part of the overall market. \"Help to Buy is primarily helping people outside London, on relatively modest mortgages, and appears very much still to be helping first time buyers. Those were the CBI's core objectives.\" He said it was important to remember that although London prices were 25% above the 2008 peak, in part fuelled by rich cash buyers, prices in the rest of the UK were still 2% lower. The CBI chief said bold action was needed from government to address the chronic shortage of houses in the UK, so that supply had a chance of keeping up with demand. The CBI wants to see councils releasing more land, and the possibility of new garden cities to be explored by policymakers. Meanwhile, Katja Hall, the CBI's chief policy director, said the warning on anti-business policies was meant for all parties but admitted Labour's pledge to freeze energy prices and the hard line on banks were concerns. \"Some of the loose language we've heard is from politicians from all parties. Of course there is concern about the proposed energy freeze and some of the proposals on banking. \"Political positioning must not be allowed to stifle investment, whether it's an unrealistic immigration target, unjustified interventions into specific markets, flirting with leaving the European Union, delaying vital long-term infrastructure projects or restricting labour market flexibility.\" The CBI wants a commitment before the election from all parties to the recommendations made on increasing the UK's airport capacity in the Davies commission. The group predicts that unemployment will fall further to 6.8% this year and 6.4% next year, from 7.5% in 2013. Hall said the UK labour market was \"looking really healthy\". She said last summer marked a turning point, with a big increase in full-time permanent employment, after a period when self-employment, part-time work, and temporary work were factors driving a rise in employment. She also made the case for zero-hours contracts, where employees are not guaranteed a minimum number of hours. \"They are not bad contracts, they are an important part of a flexible labour market and they have helped to protect jobs during the recession, and create jobs as the economy started to recover,\" she said.",

      "body": "<p>Britain's leading business lobby group has warned that policymakers must be ready to act on unsustainable house price rises in the UK.</p> <p>The CBI said it was on high alert after annual house price inflation reached more than 10% in some areas. It now expects interest rates to rise in the first three months of 2015, six months earlier than it previously predicted and, crucially, before the general election.</p> <p>John Cridland, the group's director-general, said: \"We have to remain alert to the risks posed by unsustainable house price inflation, and the [Bank of England's] financial policy committee is poised to act when necessary.</p> <p>\"Housing has come back under the spotlight as annual house price inflation figures have reached double digits on some measures. While housing transactions are still running almost 30% below their last peak in 2006, they are picking up steadily.\"</p> <p>The business lobby group is expecting house prices to rise by 8.2% this year, and by 5.1% in 2015. Prices rose 3.6% in 2013.</p> <p>It raised its forecasts for economic growth this year and next, and said the recovery was becoming better balanced with a sharp rise in business investment expected. It expects the economy to grow by 3% this year, stronger than an earlier forecast of 2.6%. Next year growth is expected to be 2.7%, compared with an earlier forecast of 2.5%.</p> <p>The CBI warned that \"loose talk\" and anti-business rhetoric in the runup to next May's general election risked damaging investment and derailing the recovery.</p> <p>\"The UK now has more stable economic foundations, and political risks must not jeopardise this. Politicians must be wary of the risk of headline-grabbing policies that weaken investment, opportunity and jobs,\" Cridland said.</p> <p>\"We've got a combination of political risks that we've not had for some while. They range from UK general election to Scottish referendum on independence to the prospect of a referendum on European Union, so that's quite a cocktail of issues.\"</p> <p>He said the message to all parties was to stick with what's working, including a commitment to cut the deficit.</p> <p>The CBI brought forward its expectation for the first rise in interest rates to the first quarter of 2015, when it expects the first 0.25 percentage point rise in rates. It had previously forecast the first rise in rates would come in the third quarter of next year. Rates have been on hold at a record low of 0.5% since March 2009.</p> <p>Cridland said the government's controversial Help to Buy scheme \u2013 blamed by some for creating a new housing bubble \u2013 was not responsible for unsustainable rises in house prices, arguing it was a relatively small part of the overall market.</p> <p>\"Help to Buy is primarily helping people outside London, on relatively modest mortgages, and appears very much still to be helping first time buyers. Those were the CBI's core objectives.\"</p> <p>He said it was important to remember that although London prices were 25% above the 2008 peak, in part fuelled by rich cash buyers, prices in the rest of the UK were still 2% lower.</p> <p>The CBI chief said bold action was needed from government to address the chronic shortage of houses in the UK, so that supply had a chance of keeping up with demand. The CBI wants to see councils releasing more land, and the possibility of new garden cities to be explored by policymakers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Katja Hall, the CBI's chief policy director, said the warning on anti-business policies was meant for all parties but admitted Labour's pledge to freeze energy prices and the hard line on banks were concerns.</p> <p>\"Some of the loose language we've heard is from politicians from all parties. Of course there is concern about the proposed energy freeze and some of the proposals on banking.</p> <p>\"Political positioning must not be allowed to stifle investment, whether it's an unrealistic immigration target, unjustified interventions into specific markets, flirting with leaving the European Union, delaying vital long-term infrastructure projects or restricting labour market flexibility.\"</p> <p>The CBI wants a commitment before the election from all parties to the recommendations made on increasing the UK's airport capacity in the Davies commission.</p> <p>The group predicts that unemployment will fall further to 6.8% this year and 6.4% next year, from 7.5% in 2013. Hall said the UK labour market was \"looking really healthy\". She said last summer marked a turning point, with a big increase in full-time permanent employment, after a period when self-employment, part-time work, and temporary work were factors driving a rise in employment. She also made the case for zero-hours contracts, where employees are not guaranteed a minimum number of hours.</p> <p>\"They are not bad contracts, they are an important part of a flexible labour market and they have helped to protect jobs during the recession, and create jobs as the economy started to recover,\" she said.</p>",
