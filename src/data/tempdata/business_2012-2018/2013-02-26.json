      "body": "<p>JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has dismissed fears over last year's huge trading loss at the company, insisting to investors: \"Whatever it is, the company will be fine.\"</p> <p>That's a long way from the fears around JP Morgan just 10 months ago, when metastasizing losses around the risky London Whale trade dented the bank's aura of invincibility compared to its rivals. Dimon, who spoke at JP Morgan's annual investor meeting in front of about 250 investors and research analysts on Tuesday, made a point of treating the incident as an anomaly. </p> <p>Last year, several JP Morgan executives, including Ina Drew, announced their departures as news of the whale losses leaked out. But on Tuesday Dimon underplayed the effect of trading mistakes on staffing. </p> <p>\"No one at JPM ever, ever worries about losing their job for making a mistake,\" Dimon said, asking: \"Why would you work there?\" He went on to denounce infighting and sniping among colleagues that he said hurts rivals. \"You worry about getting shot in the back of the head. That is what destroys these companies.\" </p> <p>Still, some analysts were skeptical. Mike Mayo, a famously pugilistic analyst with CLSA, asked Dimon about functioning under a higher level of scrutiny: \"If you chew gum and throw it on the sidewalk, you're 'in trouble' because of the whale loss,\" Mayo said. Dimon parried by saying that the bank has navigated through tougher times, including the financial crisis. </p> <p>Some of those tougher times may be coming again. Dimon identified several \"black swans\", as random and devastating financial events are known, that could hurt the bank. </p> <p>Dimon also talked about potential shocks to JP Morgan and the financial system, including the eurocrisis, which he called a \"roller coaster\". He recalled his trip to the World Economic Forum at Davos last month. \"When I was at Davos everyone was benign\" he said, contrasting that with this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/26/italy-election-austerity-eurozone-turmoil\">queasy market reaction to Italian elections</a>. </p> <p>On the euro, Dimon said, \"You are going to feel good sometimes, other times you will feel sick to your stomach. Sometimes you feel that the euro will be saved, other times no way.\" </p> <p>Dimon also weighed in, indirectly, on the current congressional fight over taxes and the batch of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/22/us-sequester-guide-spending-cuts\">deep spending cuts known as the sequester</a>. He called fiscal uncertainty \"a legitimate thing to be worried about\". </p> <p>While many in the financial markets have been worried about whether interest rates will rise, JP Morgan's co-head of investment banking, Daniel Pinto, said the bank will only make money if they do. He estimated that every percentage point rise in interest rates would benefit JP Morgan by $400m. </p> <p>The company did, however, talk about its plans to rein in expenses. </p> <p>During the day, JP Morgan announced that it would be reducing headcount, with 17,000 jobs lost over the next two years. In 2013, the bank expects to save about $1bn by reducing 6,000 jobs in its division that deals with consumers, then adding back 2,000 jobs in the credit card business. The bank stressed that it does not plan on layoffs, but will instead depend on attrition for this year's job cuts or will redeploy some workers. </p> <p>In 2014, about 15,000 job cuts will come from the mortgage division, which executives said has fewer foreclosures and delinquent mortgages to process. Chase held mortgages on 640,000 homes between 2009 and 2012, and 60% of those were either paid off or on track to be while 9% were either in foreclosure or default. The bank plans to cut expenses in its mortgage business by $3bn compared to 2012. </p> <p>Dimon defended JP Morgan's plan to release reserves that it has been holding in case of more foreclosures or delinquencies. Instead, JP Morgan will allow that money to boost its profits. \"It's not that I'm trying to manipulate our earnings,\" Dimon told analysts. His argument hinges on the expectation that foreclosures will continue to decline. </p> <p>Those reductions are in line with rivals including Bank of America, which announced last fall that it would be cutting 16,000 jobs, and Citigroup, which announced 11,000 job reductions. </p> <p>Dimon also argued against splitting up the roles of chairman and CEO, which he currently occupies. He argued that chairmen and CEOs often team together \"in cahoots\" and intimidate the other members of the board of directors, who become afraid to disagree. He suggested that the aftermath of the London Whale, in which an outside director was appointed to run a particular crisis inquiry, was an ideal arrangement. </p> <p>After a long day of complex charts and numbers, Dimon, in a stylish suit and his trademark New York accent, came onstage at the end to take questions. He won favor with the crowd with lighthearted asides and sparring with analysts including CLSA analyst Mike Mayo. </p> <p>After Mayo asked Dimon why JP Morgan did not imitate UBS in keeping a bigger buffer of cash, the two went back and forth until Dimon retorted: \"Well, I'm richer than you.\"</p> <p>Dimon also quipped to laughs from the crowd that JP Morgan's chief risk officer, John Hogan, was a \"son of a bitch\" for taking a sabbatical for a few months as the bank is still honing the ways it manages risk in the wake of the whale trade. </p> <p>Other executives who presented during the day also spoke about some of the larger pressures on the bank, including regulation. Dimon said the bank lost money because of the Durbin amendment, which reduced the amount of fees that payment processors can collect. </p> <p>Daniel Pinto, the co-head of JP Morgan's investment bank, took a parting shot at the Volcker Rule, a regulation that is part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act and currently in draft form.

The Fed is buying $85bn (\u00a356bn) in bonds each month and has said it plans to keep purchasing assets until it sees a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labour market. Tucker also admitted that cheap loans funded by the central bank were failing to reach small businesses, undermining a key policy to drive growth. He said successive schemes designed to boost lending to small businesses had failed to reach their target after the majority of loans offered as part of the central bank's \u00a380bn funding for lending scheme went to homebuyers. Forcing high street banks to accept negative interest rates when they deposit money with the central bank was another idea that was considered, he said. Tucker, who lost out to the Canadian Mark Carney in the race to succeed Sir Mervyn King as governor of the Bank, said he favoured a plan to encourage major corporations, which are flush with cash, to offer loans in partnership with the central bank to bypass the ailing banking sector. \"I am worried, and this is a personal opinion, that the current battery of credit policies are not reaching small and medium-sized businesses at the moment,\" he said.

The credit ratings agency Moody's, which strippd the UK of its AAA credit status at the weekend, warned that growth will be low for at least three years, hampering the government's ability to reduce the annual deficit. Tuckers admission that small businesses were missing out on cheap loans follows figures showing that most of the initial funds from the funding for lending scheme have been snapped up by homebuyers. The scheme, which was launched last year in a fanfare by the chancellor and King, has struggled to make an impact and has failed in recent months to reverse a slowdown in lending by banks. The new scheme would involve corporations packaging loans to small businesses, possibly suppliers, as \"working capital instruments\" with the backing of the central bank. Analysts said Tucker was floating ideas that may not come to fruition for more than a year, but gave markets analysts an insight into policymaking at the bank. In a separation submission to the committee, the bank's other deputy governor, Charles Bean, said in a separate report to MPs that he expected the British economy to improve gradually, helped by an improvement in financial markets. \"At present, my expectation is that growth will gradually strengthen this year and next on the back of that, a further easing in credit conditions, and an improvement in the global environment.

    "webTitle": "Let's play Barclays \u00a31m banker bingo | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Have a guess how many people at Barclays earned more than \u00a31m last year? Could it be 100? No, it must be more. HSBC revealed 192 in its ranks in 2011 and Barclays is much bigger in investment banking, which is where the real money is made. So 300? Or 500? Even more? All will be revealed next week. Sir David Walker, Barclays' new chairman, has decided that the bank should adopt the transparent approach on pay that he once advised for all banks. So the annual report will give tallies within bands, including one for those earning \u00a31m and above. That's in line with the disclosure regime he suggested in a government-sponsored report in 2009. As it happens, Walker went soft on his own idea the following year, arguing that it would be mistake for the UK to go it alone because our banks would be put at a competitive disadvantage. But, freshly installed at Barclays, he has rediscovered his backbone. Lead by example is the new motto \u2013 and very welcome it is too. The logic behind greater disclosure on pay is sound. If shareholders have more information on pay, they should be better equipped to challenge boards. A stunning revelation in the post-crash fallout was that 200 individuals at Royal Bank of Scotland had been earning more than chief executive Fred Goodwin. Investors \u2013 and, it seemed, the Financial Services Authority \u2013 had had no idea. If they had known, maybe more outsiders would have stopped to ask whose interests the bank was serving and queried the risks being taken.

HSBC revealed 192 in its ranks in 2011 and Barclays is much bigger in investment banking, which is where the real money is made. So 300? Or 500? Even more?</p> <p>All will be revealed next week. Sir David Walker, Barclays' new chairman, has decided that the bank should adopt the transparent approach on pay that he once advised for all banks. So the annual report will give tallies within bands, including one for those earning \u00a31m and above. That's in line with the disclosure regime he suggested in a government-sponsored report in 2009.</p> <p>As it happens, Walker went soft on his own idea the following year, arguing that it would be mistake for the UK to go it alone because our banks would be put at a competitive disadvantage. But, freshly installed at Barclays, he has rediscovered his backbone. Lead by example is the new motto \u2013 and very welcome it is too.</p> <p>The logic behind greater disclosure on pay is sound. If shareholders have more information on pay, they should be better equipped to challenge boards. A stunning revelation in the post-crash fallout was that 200 individuals at Royal Bank of Scotland had been earning more than chief executive Fred Goodwin. Investors \u2013 and, it seemed, the Financial Services Authority \u2013 had had no idea. If they had known, maybe more outsiders would have stopped to ask whose interests the bank was serving and queried the risks being taken.</p> <p>Barclays' voluntary conversion to greater disclosure will send a useful message that the new regime, under Walker and chief executive Antony Jenkins, is prepared to be judged by results on its pledge to \"rebalance\" pay so that investors get a great share of the spoils.

      "bodyText": "Morrisons has snapped up six HMV stores from the failed music company's administrators as part of its continuing drive to expand its convenience store operation. The new stores will be converted into Morrisons M local branches and opened this summer, adding to its current roster of 49 former Blockbuster stores and seven former Jessops shops which it bought over the last two months. It is the first sale of HMV stores since the company collapsed into administration at the start of the year, with 1,500 staff already axed, 103 stores closing and a further 1,500 jobs under threat. Morrisons bosses hope to challenge the dominance of Tesco and Sainsbury's in the convenience store market but with only 13 stores open so far, they have an uphill battle on their hands. Morrisons have made it clear in the past that they want to expand in London and the south-east in particular, however, the six stores are dotted around the country. The six stores are in Chesterfield, Newbury, Enfield, Scarborough, Lancaster and Wood Green. The supermarket opened its first London convenience store on Monday and wants to open at least 70 by the end of the year. Chief executive Dalton Philips is under pressure after Morrisons posted a 2.5% fall in sales over Christmas, which left it trailing behind the growth of rivals Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda over similar periods. This month, Morrisons acquired seven shops from the failed camera chain Jessops and 49 from the collapsed DVD rental firm Blockbuster, with half of the latter being in the South East. The company are so keen to find new sites to set up its M stores, it is offering staff a \u00a3500 bonus if anyone can identify empty properties it turns into the new shops. Gordon Mowat, Managing Director of Morrisons Convenience said: \"We have either opened or acquired 70 stores just one month into our financial year so we are pleased that we will exceed our 2013 target. \"Our focus is now on opening these stores as soon as we can as well as pushing on to secure even more sites.\"",

With Italy now back under pressure, the idea of a break-up of the eurozone - which seemed to have been put to one side - has suddenly re-emerged.</p> <p>So financial shares fell back, especially banks with exposure to Italy. <strong>Barclays</strong> dropped 14.65p to 297p while <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> fell 15.3p to 339.5p, <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> lost 1.79p to 53.14p and <strong>HSBC</strong> closed 16.9p lower at 713p. Analyst Sandy Chen at Cenkos put Barclays' exposure to Italy at \u00a324bn, while RBS was said to have \u00a37bn of net exposures and \u00a312bn of gross derivatives exposure, HSBC $9bn and Lloyds \u00a30.3bn.</p> <p>Other financials falling included <strong>Schroders</strong>, down 64p at \u00a319.80.</p> <p>RBS had climbed higher on Monday on talk of a possible sale of a stake in its US business Citizens. But analyst Ian Gordon at Investec was not impressed:</p> <blockquote> Everybody wants to hear good news on RBS. \"They're so thirsty for it, they'll crawl through the desert towards a mirage, and when they discover there's no water, they'll drink the sand.\" (The American President (1995)). We regard yesterday's bounce as typical - a response to media reports of a possible, partial IPO of Citizens, with the implicit double whammy of earnings dilution and no capital uplift. Hope springs eternal! Meanwhile, dreadful January BBA mortgage data, the worst for two years, offers a sobering wake-up call. Sell. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 84.93 points lower at 6270.44, although at its worst it had fallen to 6258. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote> European markets remain in shock from the lack of a result in the Italian election. The news came as a nasty surprise for those accustomed to the steady march higher. The Italian people have spoken, but we're not yet sure what they said. What is obvious, however, is that popular discontent with austerity measures remains strong in Europe. This is a warning to anyone who assumed that [European Central Bank head] Mario Draghi had quelled the crisis with his pledge to defend the euro. Mr Draghi can defuse tensions in financial markets, but he can't win over voters. <br> </blockquote> <p>Riskier assets were unwanted, which meant a fall for the mining sector. <strong>Vedanta Resources </strong>dropped 46p to \u00a311.73 and <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> closed 9.8p lower at 356.2p.</p> <p><strong>Whitbread </strong>was down 94p at \u00a324.69 as the Costa Coffee, Premier Inns and Beefeater pubs group said fourth quarter sales were slowed by bad weather. The company, which has also been caught up in the horsemeat scandal, said like for like sales rose 2.7%, but that was down from 3.3% in the third quarter and 4.3% in the first half. James Hollins at Investec said: </p> <blockquote> Whitbread's fourth quarter revenue was up 2.7%, below our 4.7% forecast. Total reported sales were in line with estimates, implying better than expected international roll-out/performance of new Costa and Premier Inn units, notably in London where Premier Inn has increased its room capacity by 22% during the year. 2013 results are on track to be in line with expectations, according to the statement. However, given the unattractive valuation multiples, we retain our sell stance and \u00a320 price target. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Croda</strong> climbed 28p to \u00a325.84 after the speciality chemicals group reported a 6.6% rise in annual profits.</p> <p>Engineering group <strong>GKN</strong> recovered from earlier falls to close 9p higher at 261.3p after a better than expected 19% rise in full year profits. But the group, which makes car and plane parts, was cautious about the outlook for its auto business.</p> <p>Building materials group <strong>CRH</strong> added 14p to \u00a314.35. It reported a 5% fall in pretax profits as the eurozone crisis hit its business in the region, but the outcome was in line with forecasts. It also announced the retirement of chief executive Myles Lee at the end of the year. In a buy note Jefferies said:</p> <blockquote> It's not clear whether CRH plans an internal appointment as it has historically done, or whether it will look externally. It expects to make a decision in the third quarter. Either way, we would expect the new chief executive to look for further significant cost savings within the businesses, and to re-examine whether the diverse group of businesses in CRH still makes sense, both from an industry standpoint, and because it makes it difficult for investors to understand the potential/risks. <br> </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Sports Direct International</strong> lost 21.5p to 409p after founder Mike Ashley sold 25m shares at 400p each to raise \u00a3100m and take his stake down from 68.6% to around 64%. Ashley agreed not to sell any further shares for a year.</p> <p>Another big faller was <strong>St Modwen Properties</strong>, down 29.2p at 248.6p.</p> <p>The company raised \u00a349m with a placing of 20m shares at 245p each to fund its share of the New Covent Garden Market development in central London. Analysts at Espirito Santo, who have a neutral rating on the company, said:</p> <blockquote> In our view, today's capital raising is opportunistic given that St Modwen's valuation has recently improved to a small net asset value premium and the first capital call at New Covent Garden Market is unlikely until early 2015. <br> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile <strong>Redrow</strong>, the housebuilder chaired by Steve Morgan who failed to take it private last year, dropped 6.9p to 188.9p despite a 50% rise in first half profits.</p> <p>Finally <strong>Ocado</strong>, the online grocer, has opened its second warehouse and delivered its first orders from the site in Warwickshire on Sunday.</p> <p>The company, which announced earlier this month that its losses had fallen from \u00a32.4m to \u00a3600,000, hopes the new \u00a3200m \"customer fulfilment centre\" will boost efficiency by increasing its capacity.</p> <p>But in a falling market its shares lost 1.3p to 122.2p.</p>",

Mr Draghi can defuse tensions in financial markets, but he can't win over voters. Riskier assets were unwanted, which meant a fall for the mining sector. Vedanta Resources dropped 46p to \u00a311.73 and Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation closed 9.8p lower at 356.2p. Whitbread was down 94p at \u00a324.69 as the Costa Coffee, Premier Inns and Beefeater pubs group said fourth quarter sales were slowed by bad weather. The company, which has also been caught up in the horsemeat scandal, said like for like sales rose 2.7%, but that was down from 3.3% in the third quarter and 4.3% in the first half. James Hollins at Investec said: Whitbread's fourth quarter revenue was up 2.7%, below our 4.7% forecast. Total reported sales were in line with estimates, implying better than expected international roll-out/performance of new Costa and Premier Inn units, notably in London where Premier Inn has increased its room capacity by 22% during the year. 2013 results are on track to be in line with expectations, according to the statement. However, given the unattractive valuation multiples, we retain our sell stance and \u00a320 price target. But Croda climbed 28p to \u00a325.84 after the speciality chemicals group reported a 6.6% rise in annual profits. Engineering group GKN recovered from earlier falls to close 9p higher at 261.3p after a better than expected 19% rise in full year profits. But the group, which makes car and plane parts, was cautious about the outlook for its auto business. Building materials group CRH added 14p to \u00a314.35. It reported a 5% fall in pretax profits as the eurozone crisis hit its business in the region, but the outcome was in line with forecasts. It also announced the retirement of chief executive Myles Lee at the end of the year. In a buy note Jefferies said: It's not clear whether CRH plans an internal appointment as it has historically done, or whether it will look externally. It expects to make a decision in the third quarter. Either way, we would expect the new chief executive to look for further significant cost savings within the businesses, and to re-examine whether the diverse group of businesses in CRH still makes sense, both from an industry standpoint, and because it makes it difficult for investors to understand the potential/risks. Among the mid-caps Sports Direct International lost 21.5p to 409p after founder Mike Ashley sold 25m shares at 400p each to raise \u00a3100m and take his stake down from 68.6% to around 64%. Ashley agreed not to sell any further shares for a year. Another big faller was St Modwen Properties, down 29.2p at 248.6p. The company raised \u00a349m with a placing of 20m shares at 245p each to fund its share of the New Covent Garden Market development in central London. Analysts at Espirito Santo, who have a neutral rating on the company, said: In our view, today's capital raising is opportunistic given that St Modwen's valuation has recently improved to a small net asset value premium and the first capital call at New Covent Garden Market is unlikely until early 2015. Meanwhile Redrow, the housebuilder chaired by Steve Morgan who failed to take it private last year, dropped 6.9p to 188.9p despite a 50% rise in first half profits. Finally Ocado, the online grocer, has opened its second warehouse and delivered its first orders from the site in Warwickshire on Sunday. The company, which announced earlier this month that its losses had fallen from \u00a32.4m to \u00a3600,000, hopes the new \u00a3200m \"customer fulfilment centre\" will boost efficiency by increasing its capacity. But in a falling market its shares lost 1.3p to 122.2p.",

      "bodyText": "Growth in retail sales have slowed this month, according to a survey by the Confederation of British Industry, reflecting the reluctance among shoppers to spend on the high street. The CBI's latest quarterly distributive trades survey, which includes the first two weeks of February, found that 37% of retailers experienced an increase in their volume of sales in the year to February and 29% reported a reduction. The resulting balance of +8% was the lowest figure since last September and was the third consecutive month in which the pace of growth had slowed. Analysts said the figures were largely the result of persistently high inflation and low wage rises hitting household disposable incomes. The gap between wage rises, which are running at 1.3% and inflation at 2.7% is expected to remain during the rest of the year. The survey emphasised the weak outlook after shops said that volume of orders fell sharply (-19%) against expectations they would remain flat (0%). But sales volumes were higher than last year and pointed to a level of spending that could save the UK from a triple-dip recession. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said the survey showed retailers suffered a weaker than expected February. \"The fact that the CBI survey remains in positive territory gives good reason to believe that sales will rebound to some extent in February.

      "bodyText": "European markets have closed for the evening, and after the day's bloodbath investors must be quite relieved. The uncertainty created by the Italian election result has sent them scurrying for the hills, as the eurozone crisis rises from the dead. \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished down 84.93 points or 1.34% at 6270.44 \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 2.27% \u2022 France's Cac has closed 2.67% lower \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB has ended a volatile day 4.89% lower, its biggest daily fall for nearly a year \u2022 Spain's Ibex is off 3.2% on renewed contagion worries \u2022 In Athens the market is down 0.38% But in the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.7% higher after Federal Reserve boss Ben Bernanke was dovish about the prospects of continuing bond buying to stimulate the world's largest economy. Back with Italy, and the country's borrowing costs have climbed sharply, with 10 year yields rising from 4.37% last night to 4.91%. The two year is up 47 basis points to 2.17%. The euro has fallen 0.1% against the dollar to $1.308 but rose 0.2% against the pound to 86.2p. And with that, it's time to shut up shop for the evening. Thanks for all the comments, and we'll be back tomorrow for all the fallout from this latest develpement in the eurozone crisis. And here's another scathing little quote about the Italian election. Initially attributed to Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, it was said by Hans van Baalen, leader of VVD party in the European Parliament ( Rutte\u2019s party): Italians must elect who they want to elect and must bear the consequences when they elect clowns. (Thanks to Open Europe for the clarification) Could Italy's centre left leader Pier Luigi Bersani form an alliance with the anti-establishment Beppo Grillo? Open Europe has punted the idea following Bersani's press conference: [Bersani] said that, if asked to form the new government, he will put forward a \"programme\" - basically a to-do list for the next government, including changes to the electoral law, cuts to the cost of bureaucracy and politics in general and new policies for job creation to be discussed at the European level (whatever that means). His line was that it's more important to \"discuss what we want to do for this country\" rather than wasting time in \"diplomatic\" exercises in an attempt to form a traditional coalition. And that sounds very similar to what Grillo said earlier today, i.e. taking a policy-by-policy approach rather than going for a fixed coalition (in contrast to Berlusconi). So, could there be some sort of loose Bersani-Grillo alliance emerging? Full piece here. European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso seems to be taking a swing at democracy, or \"populism\" as he called it. Speaking at a Reuters summit he said - in the wake of Italian voters rejecting Mario Monti's austerity programme: I hope we are not going to follow the temptation to give in to populism because of the results in one specific member state. The question we have to ask ourselves is the following: should we determine our policy, our economic policy, by short-term electoral considerations or by what has to be done to put Europe back on the path to sustainable growth? For me the answer is clear. Barroso said that just because Monti had been turfed out of office, it did not mean his policies were wrong. Clearly Barroso is not trying to be \"populist\". Pier Luigi Bersani, head of Italy's centre left Democratic Party, has said the eurozone crisis and austerity policies were behind the election results. He said: \"We did not win, even though we came first,\" and added that they must react with humility to the the outcome of the election. \"Our first responsibility to the country is to represent change, more so than in the election campaign,\" he said. (Bersani had been accused of approaching the campaign too cautiously.) He said the party would propose basic reforms for the political system, and support for those suffering in the crisis. But they could not get away from the gravity of the situation and the risks to the country. As the largest coalition it should be allowed to have the first attempt at forming a government. He said he would appeal to parliament, and it was up to Silvio Berlusconi and Beppo Grillo to assume their responsibilities. Asked if he would resign after the election result, he did not reply directly but said he would not abandon ship. The anti-establishment Five Star movement of comic Beppo Grillo, whose success in the Italian election has torpedoed the more mainstream parties, has helped bring about the current stalemate. And Grillo reckons any attempts by the other parties to form a government are doomed to fail. According to Reuters, Grillo believes it would not last six months: They won't be able to govern. Whether I'm there or not they won't be able to govern. He said he would work with anyone who supported his policies but rejected entering a formal coalition: It's not time to talk of alliances... the system has already fallen. It wasn't all bad news for Italy's technocrat prime minister Mario Monti, whose poor performance in the election is a bit of an embarrassment and a slapdown of his austerity reforms. It appears he didn't fail everywhere: US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke has strongly defended the central bank's bond buying programme in testimony to the Senate. He said the benefits of the stimulus outweighed the possible costs. He said the Fed was aware of the public losing confidence it its ability to unwind its programme smoothly or the possible destabilising effects of low interest rates. But he said these risks did not seem material at the moment. He said: To this point, we do not see the potential costs of the increased risk-taking in some financial markets as outweighing the benefits of promoting a stronger economic recovery and more rapid job creation. But he urged politicians to avoid the spending cuts due to come into force at the end of the week, which he warned could combine with earlier tax rises to create a \"significant headwind\" for the economic recovery. Markets have greeted his dovish tone on the quantitative easing programme positively, concluding it means the prospect of further easing. The testimony followed some positive data, with positive new homes sales, growing consumer confidence and an unexpected jump in the Richmond Fed manufacturing survey. US markets, which fell sharply on Monday after the impasse in Italy became clearer, are recovering ahead of a testimony before the Senate by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up almost 100 points in early trading, but this has done little to help European markets, which are still firmly in the red. \u2022 The FTSE 100 is down 1.11% or 70.52 points \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is 3.84% lower \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 1.41% and France's Cac 1.63% \u2022 Italy's borrowing costs are still higher, up to 4.82% from 4.37% last night While Italy struggles to elect a government the Irish Coalition seems to be on the verge of saving \u20ac300m of its public pay bill as the Republic continues to be the 'poster child' for the EU, writes Henry McDonald in Dublin. Agreement on a national wages and pension agreement in the public sector still hinges on unions accepting the deal. They are balloting their members over the weekend. But the politician heading up the negotiations, the Labour Minister Brendan Howlin promised today that this will be the \"last ask\" from the government to the unions in terms of accepting austerity measures. Speaking outside Government Buildings in central Dublin today, Howlin directly appealed to the unions to endorse the agreement: \"I have said to public servants that this is the last ask. If you consider this, swallow hard as I know it's not easy and vote for this, we will not be coming back again and we can plan our recovery over the next three years.\" Cuts to wages include a ten per cent reduction for any civil servant earning \u20ac185,000 or more. To demonstrate solidarity with public servants, the Cabinet are also taking pay cuts. Taoiseach Enda Kenny will see his \u20ac200,000 salary reduced to \u20ac185,350, while Irish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Eamon Gilmore will see his \u20ac184,405 salary drop to \u20ac171,308. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and new head of the eurogroup, has added his voice to those calling for Italy to stick to its agreements with the rest of the eurozone. He told Dutch broadcaster RTL7: I think and I hope there is a broad understanding that there is also a responsibility for the stability of the eurozone as a whole, and that agreements have to be met. Pulling Europe from the economic doldrums requires a stable, political policy, also in Italy. Here's a quick summary of the developments so far: \u2022 The Italian election has resulted in deadlock, with the centre-left group led by Pier Luigi Bersani winning a narrow victory in the lower house but the senate deeply split \u2022 There was a surge of support for Beppo Grillo's Five Star Movement with voters disillusioned by austerity and the existing political parties \u2022 European stock markets are in retreat and Italy's borrowing costs rising after the uncertain outcome \u2022 Two German politicians have said Italy must stick to its reform programme despite the surge in support for parties opposing it \u2022 The European Commission said it had heard the concerns of the people but Italy must continue to address its deficit \u2022 Analysts say unity government could still be formed but new elections may be necessary Our latest news story on the election is here. With the current political crisis in Italy, there are also disagreements elsewhere about the way forward. In Portugal for instance, prime minister Passos Coelho has been playing down concerns about its bailout, as its creditors start another review. As reported by Reuters, he said: We do not want more time under the adjustment programme, neither more time, nor more money. We intend to conclude the bailout programme by mid-2014 with the same financial package that has been envisaged. But the leader of the main opposition party has said the package should be renegotiated. Socialist head Antonio Jose Seguro said: We need more time and a delay of interest payments. There cannot be more austerity, there has to be a strategy of growth. I hope the government refuses proposals (by the troika of lenders) for more austerity. Seguro also said the election result in Italy was \"very worrying\". Open Europe, the thinktank, outlines the potential scenarios for Italy: A national unity government, if Bersani, Berlusconi and Monti join forces \u2013 could be possible but may not be enough to avoid snap elections (maybe as early as next year, and after the electoral law is changed); Grillo U-turns and agrees to form a coalition with Bersani\u2019s centre-left alliance; A re-run election (presumably within 3-4 months) (with a caretaker government taking temporary control). But without a change to Italy's convoluted system of proportional representation, a new election might not help! Under scenarios 1 and 3, there will be a lot of pressure to change the electoral law before new elections to avoid a similar stalemate. For that, however, there needs to be a majority in both houses, meaning that we\u2019re looking at a potential Catch-22. Berlusconi, of course, has already said he wouldn't want fresh elections - and other parties also appear opposed. Here's the likely timescale: 15 March: First sitting of the Italian parliament (both chambers). By 20 March: The speakers of both chambers should have been elected. After 20 March: Italian President Giorgio Napolitano starts official consultations on the formation of the new government. However, there's another problem - Napolitano no longer has the power to dissolve parliament, because he is in the last six months of his mandate (his term finishes in May). So if a new vote is needed, there could be months of paralysis while MPs elects a new president, so that parliament could be dissolved. Full details here. And with that, I'm handing over to Nick Fletcher.... Pier Luigi Bersani, the centre-left leader who won control of the Italian lower house but not the Senate, is due to give a press conference in around three hours time (4pm GMT / 5pm CET) The European commission also warned that Italy must address its huge debt pile, in its first public comment on the election results. Olivier Bailly, EC spokesman, told a regular press briefing in Brussels that Italy needs a government that will push for stronger economic growth and job creation. Asked about today's tumbling stock markets, Bailly said: Markets are free to react the way they want. As far as the Commission is concerned, we would like to underline our full confidence in the Italian authorities in their capacity to find and establish a political majority that will continue to deliver a growth and jobs agenda, which is what Italy needs to reduce the unsustainable level of its debt. At around \u20ac2 trillion, Italy's public debt is expected to hit 128% of national output during 2013. But its annual deficit is relatively low, and could fall below 3% of GDP this year. Bailly also insisted that the EC had heard the voice of Italians, and indicated some frustration with the way the election was fought (Bersani, in particular, approached the campaign rather cautiously) Another photo from the Frankfurt stock market (that's Beppe Grillo on the TV news). Italy's financial regulator has responded to the heavy falls on the Milan stock market by banning people from short-selling shares in the country's biggest bank - Intesa San Paolo. Intesa San Paolo's shares have already shed 10% in a volatile sell-off this morning. Short-selling bans, which prevent speculators selling shares they don't own - are often rolled out at times of crisis. They won't stop investors selling out, though, and traders in Italy aren't impressed: Europe's financial markets are still in retreat today, led by Italy where there's been little relief from its rout. Spain's stock market has also seen a rush of sellers - reflecting concern that an escalating eurozone crisis could swamp Madrid's efforts to avoid a bailout. Here's a round-up of the latest major indices: Italy's FTSE MIB: down 745 points at 15606, -4.5% FTSE 100: down 81 points at 6273. -1.29% German DAX: down 149 points at 7623, - 1.9% French CAC: down 85 points at 3636, - 2.29% Spanish IBEX: down 227 points at 8017, -2.75% Italian borrowing costs also remain sharply higher, after nervy bond traders drove down its bonds. 10-year Italian bonds are changing hands at a yield of 4.78% -- around 0.4 percentage points higher today. Higher yields indicate that Italy is a riskier bet \u2013 a safe call, frankly. but something of a worry given tomorrow's big bond sale. Robert O\u2019Daly, Italy analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), comments: With Italy looking ungovernable, the financial markets are responding as expected. Germany's foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, has now weighed in, becoming the third German politician to argue that Italy must stick with Monti's reform plan. Speaking in Berlin, Westerwelle said it was important that a stable Italian government is formed quickly - one that is committed to Monti's policies. Given Monti's poor show, and the way Berlusconi won support by painting himself as the alternative to German oppression, this may not be the best approach from Westerwelle: Italy has seen its borrowing costs jump at its auction of short-term debt this morning. It sold \u20ac8.75bn of six-month bills, as planned, but at an interest rate of 1.237% \u2013 much higher than the 0.73% agreed at a similar sale last month. Analysts blamed the post-election deadlock. Italy is due to sell long-term debt tomorrow, and Christian Lenk of DZ Bank is warning that it will probably have to accept higher borrowing costs then too. Our Southern Europe editor, John Hooper, flags up that we shouldn't simply see the Italian election result as a simple vote against austerity. He explains that the surge in support for Beppe Grillo's Five Star movement reflects a deeper disenchantment with Italy's entire political system: John writes: Market analysts this morning are interpreting this as a vote against austerity. But that is not the whole story, and they will misunderstand (and underestimate) the result if they see if through an exclusively euro zone, macro-economic lens. Many of Grillo's supporters are unquestionably fed up with their economic prospects. A recent study by the Demos think tank showed they were far more likely to be (a) pessimistic about Italy's (and Europe's) prospects and (b) unemployed. But while Grillo did indeed lambast the current direction of the EU and the euro zone in his campaign (decrying Mario Monti as Angela Merkel's poodle), his Five Star Movement's main target is Italy's sleazy, complacent political establishment. A new government made up of pro-growth, anti-austerity ministers drawn from among the same old parties will not make the M5S go away. What is more, the movement's attitude to the EU is profoundly ambiguous. When I spent well over an hour with him a few weeks ago he described himself as a \"convinced European\". That meeting led to this article: Beppe Grillo: populist who could throw Italy into turmoil at general election. John continues: But, Grillo says, the decision on the euro is such an important one that Italy's membership needs to be decided by the people in a referendum. The same is true of M5S's economic approach. Grillo himself espouses an anti-capitalism that chimes with many of the ideas of the Occupy and anti-globalism movements. But his movement's programme actually talks about cutting the budget deficit, and with spending cuts. Two German politicians have declared that Italy must stick with the reform programme which Mario Monti has put underway -- despite the surge of support for parties which oppose it. Michael Grosse-Br\u00f6mer, the parliamentary floor leader of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), said this morning. It is important that Italy has a functioning government. Monti's reform path must be continued. (via Reuters). German economy minister Philipp R\u00f6sler was putting a brace face on events, saying that he could imagine a better result for the pro-reform parties. But in a statement, R\u00f6sler insisted there was no other way: There is no alternative to the structural reforms that are already underway and which include consolidating the budget and boosting competitiveness. Meanwhile the German tabloid newpaper, Bild, is horrified by Beppe Grillo's ascendancy, and the reappearance of Silvio Berlusconi. Its headline asks: \"Are they going to destroy our euro now?\" \"Our\" euro? Heads-up: Italy is about to hold an auction of short-term bonds. Italy's current prime minister, Mario Monti, is about to hold talks with the governor of the Bank of Italy, Ignazio Visco, and his own finance minister, Vittorio Grilli, about the situation following the election. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, reports that there is shock in Brussels about the Italian election result: But in Britain one Conservative MP, the maverick Douglas Carswell, has welcomed the surge in support for Beppe Grillo, and Mario Monti's poor showing: From Italy, our Rome correspondent Lizzy Davies reports that Italians have woken up to \"utter confusion\" Last night the possibility of fresh elections was being mooted by some. But the centre-left Democratic Party appeared to back away from that, and this morning Berlusconi had had his say too. Asked on Canale 5 television about another vote, the former prime minister replied in his inimitable style: \"I don't think that would be helpful in this situation because there are no political programmes that have been discussed. The only one to have put forward programmes in this campaign was me.\" As mentioned at 8.40am, Berlusconi said all parties must reflect on the result and make sacrificies \"for the good of Italy\". Lizzy reports that, with the markets sliding, the former PM reminded us of his financial views, and criticised comparisons between Italy's borrowing costs and Germany's. The spread between yields on Italian and German government bonds was \"an invention of two years ago\" without which Italians had lived very happily for years, he explained, adding that he was not worried about the effect the result was having on the markets. \"The markets are independent and also a bit reckless,\" he said. According to the Ansa news agency, he said: \"Let's be done with the spread. Let leave it.\" That spread has widened significantly today, following the fall in the value of Italian bonds (see 7.57am). Why there is stalemate in Italy The situation after yesterday's elections is that the centre-left has, as expected, secured a majority in the lower house of parliament, or chamber. But in the upper house, or Senate, it has just two seats more than the centre-right bloc led by Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom People party. Centre-left: 119 seats Berlusconi's alliance: 117 seats Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement: 54 seats Mario Monti's centrist group: 18 seats Thus total deadlock - as Grillo has previously said that Five Star will not work with other parties. The Italian election results have knocked the wind right out of Europe's austerity drive, City analysts are suggesting today. Here's a round-up of early comment: Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale: The cognoscenti will be focusing on the fact that the Italian election was a clear anti-austerity protest by the people of the Euro Zone's third-largest economy. Austerity delivers an even higher debt levels as it induces perma-recession, so what's the point? Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research The election result is an embarrassment for Mario Monti, who managed to win around 10% of the vote in both houses, a triumphant return for Mr Berlusconi and a breakthrough for Beppe Grillo\u2019s Five Star Movement. One can assume that Angela Merkel had to be served her dinner with plastic cutlery last night. ....the early indications are that Mr Grillo is still sticking to his pre-election promise that he would not enter into a coalition with either of the traditional parties. If he sticks to that line then it would appear to leave only some form of \u2018Grand Coalition\u2019 or new elections. One would imagine that the last thing that Mr Bersani would want is another set of elections because the momentum would appear to be with Mr Grillo. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities: It would appear that another round of elections are inevitable [after] a victory for Mr Grillo, a resounding defeat for the establishment as represented by Berlusconi, Bersani and Monti. Matt Basi, of CMC Markets: Results from this weekend\u2019s Italian election saw voters show firm opposition to austerity plans instigated by outgoing PM Mario Monti, in favour of a comedian and a tax evader with a scandal list that goes on longer than a Bunga Bunga party. Unsurprisingly, Italian treasuries are better offered this morning. Trading in several Italian banks was suspended as soon as the market opened, because investors were so desperate to sell, trader @finansakrobat explains: Political developments in Italy: Silvio Berlusconi has ruled out forming a coalition with Mario Monti, the technocratic PM who took power when Berlusconi was ousted in November 2011. In a TV interview Berlusconi, whose centre-right coalition was narrowly defeated in the lower Italian parliament, said that all parties need to make sacrifices. Asked if he'd be prepared to work with Pier Luigi's centre-left Democratic Party, Berlusconi said: Italy cannot be left ungoverned, we have to reflect. Berlusconi conceded that the centre-left had won the battle in the lower house (last night his party had argued that the race was too close to call). He also argued that Monti's weak performance showed that Italians would not accept his unpopular austerity measures. Shares in Italy's two biggest lenders are being hammered - Intesa San Paolo is down 10%, with UniCredit falling 8.8%. There's also a big selloff in Spain - where the IBEX index has fallen by 3%. in Milan the Italian stock market is plunging - by much more than feared. The FTSE MIB, made up of the biggest companies on the market, has fallen by 5% -- shedding over 760 points (it took several nervous minutes before all shares were trading properly) Yesterday afternoon the MIB actually spiked by 4% when the first exit polls emerged, suggesting a win for the centre-left coalition. The reality - a divided Senate with no clear way ahead - has sent investors fleeing. As feared, European stock markets are sliding at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 has dived by 92 points, to nearly 1.5%, to 6262. Financial stocks are suffering, with Barclays shedding more than 5% Here's a chart of the biggest fallers: The French market has been hit even harder by the chaos in Italy, down over 3%, while Germany's DAX is down over 1%. Our latest news story from Italy is online here: Italy election sparks fresh fears for euro. Here's a flavour: Neither right nor left had an outright majority in the upper house, where the balance will be held by Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement (M5S). Grillo has ruled out supporting either side in his drive to sweep away Italy's existing political parties and the cronyistic culture they support \u2013 a sentiment he appeared to reiterate after the count by insisting the M5S was not planning on \"any stitch-ups, big or small\" and lambasting Berlusconi's voters for committing \"a crime against the galaxy\" Alarming moves in the bond markets too, where Italian government debt is being sold off sharply, dragging Spain down too. The yield (or interest rate) on 10-year Italian bonds has jumped dramatically to 4.82%, from just 4.37% last night. That's a truly dramatic move, and means traders are rushing to sell their Italian bonds. Spanish 10-year bonds, another key benchmark, are now yielding more than 5.4%, from 5.1% last night. It's a picture we've seen before in the eurozone crisis, when fear grows over a peripheral country's ability to repay their debts. The uncertainty in Italy has sent the euro reeling, now down by nearly 3 cents against the US dollar since the first predictions from Italy. It just hit a low of $1.3034 - having received a thorough hoofing during Asian trading dominated by talk that the the eurozone's economic plans were in deep trouble. As Paul Bloxham, HSBC's chief economist for Australia, told CNBC: We're now left in limbo and we don't know what the election result means for the reform agenda and the policies Italy needs to implement. It's not a helpful outcome at all. City traders are expecting big losses when trading begins. IG is forecasting that the main Italian index, the FTSE MIB, will fall by over 400 points, or 2.5%. It also reckons the FTSE 100 will dive by 100 points in London. Markets hate uncertainty, as Chris Weston, IG's chief market strategist, explains: We simply don\u2019t know the state of play with Italian politics, and markets find sellers in times of instability. The President will take centre stage now and either form a \u2018grand coalition\u2019, although this seems unlikely. It has been speculated that Mr Bersani may look to team up with Beppe Grillo\u2019s Five Star movement (again unlikely), or ultimately fresh elections will be called down the track. This is a story of anti-austerity and one where most hadn\u2019t expected the anti-austerity / anti-European parties to do anywhere near as well as they have. The Italian voter has spoken out and this has thrown up political instability as perhaps the number one issue facing Europe in 2013. Good morning. European financial markets are expected to tumble this morning after Italy's general election left the country deadlocked After a dramatic day in Italy, the centre-left group led by Pier Luigi Bersani has won a narrow victory in the lower house of parliament. The Senate, though, appears to be deeply split with no party winning sufficient seats to control it. And the really big shock for the European establishment is the success of the Five Star Movement, led by comedian Beppe Grillo. It has won more votes than any other party - a remarkable achievement, which shows deep anger in Italy against the political status quo. But it was a bad night for Mario Monti, whose centrist pro-reform coalition was a distant fourth place - failing to win enough seats in the Senate to form a coalition with Bersani. There is talk that a second election will be needed to break the deadlock, unless political leaders can somehow agree a workable coalition. The euro has already fallen sharply in overnight trading, and traders are braced for a big sell-off when European stock markets open in one hour's time. Just when when politicians and financial markets have grown confident (some might say complacent) that the worst was over, the eurozone debt crisis has flared back into life. We'll be tracking all the developments through the day ...",

One can assume that Angela Merkel had to be served her dinner with plastic cutlery last night.</p> <p>....the early indications are that Mr Grillo is still sticking to his pre-election promise that he would not enter into a coalition with either of the traditional parties. If he sticks to that line then it would appear to leave only some form of \u2018Grand Coalition\u2019 or new elections. One would imagine that the last thing that Mr Bersani would want is another set of elections because the momentum would appear to be with Mr Grillo.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Marc Ostwald</strong> of <strong>Monument Securities:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would appear that another round of elections are inevitable [after] a victory for Mr Grillo, a resounding defeat for the establishment as represented by Berlusconi, Bersani and Monti.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Matt Basi</strong>, of <strong>CMC Markets</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Results from this weekend\u2019s Italian election saw voters show firm opposition to austerity plans instigated by outgoing PM Mario Monti, in favour of a comedian and a tax evader with a scandal list that goes on longer than a Bunga Bunga party.

Analysts predicted the placing price would be at a 5% to 10% discount to last night's closing price, which would raise more than \u00a350m. Analysts at Espirito Santo, who have a neutral rating on the company, said:</p> <blockquote> In our view, today's capital raising is opportunistic given that St Modwen's valuation has recently improved to a small net asset value premium and the first capital call at New Covent Garden Market is unlikely until early 2015. <br> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Keith Crawford at Peel Hunt said:</p> <blockquote> St Modwen has capitalised on its strong share price to raise \u00a350m plus to start funding, in part, the vast Nine Elms development site. The equity raised is non-essential, but reduces leverage to a conservative 33% loan to value and in our view shareholders should support such initiatives. Hold for now, but buy on any weakness. </blockquote> <p>Weakness there has been.

      "bodyText": "One of the biggest fallers on a downbeat day is St Modwen Properties. The company has announced a placing of up to 9.99% to fund its share of the New Covent Garden Market development in central London. Analysts predicted the placing price would be at a 5% to 10% discount to last night's closing price, which would raise more than \u00a350m. Analysts at Espirito Santo, who have a neutral rating on the company, said: In our view, today's capital raising is opportunistic given that St Modwen's valuation has recently improved to a small net asset value premium and the first capital call at New Covent Garden Market is unlikely until early 2015. Meanwhile Keith Crawford at Peel Hunt said: St Modwen has capitalised on its strong share price to raise \u00a350m plus to start funding, in part, the vast Nine Elms development site. The equity raised is non-essential, but reduces leverage to a conservative 33% loan to value and in our view shareholders should support such initiatives. Hold for now, but buy on any weakness. Weakness there has been. St Modwen's shares are currently 10% lower, down 27.8p at 250p. Meanwhile Redrow, the housebuilder chaired by Steve Morgan who failed to take it private last year, has dropped 10.4p to 185.4p despite a 50% rise in first half profits. Morgan, who also owns Championship football club Wolverhampton Wanderers, said he was cautiously optimistic that the recovery would continue.
