      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest pub landlord, Punch Taverns, controlled by a small band of hedge funds, has warned its two pub divisions will tumble into default if bondholders block latest proposals to restructure \u00a32.3bn of borrowings in a vote next month. Executive chairman Stephen Billingham, a restructuring expert parachuted in to thrash out a deal between two stakeholder groups in 2011, said he was confident all classes of bondholders would end up grudgingly accepting that the latest plan \u2013 the fourth Punch and its advisers have come up with \u2013 represented the best viable outcome. \"I think they [senior bondholder groups] have got most things they wanted.

There has been little dialogue between the two sides in the last month. For more than three years debt-laden Punch, which owns about 4,000 pubs, has been a zombie company, frozen in the middle of a Mexican standoff between competing interests of shareholders and bondholders. Meanwhile, the business \u2013 which has a share value of little more than \u00a3100m \u2013 has paid out \u00a320m for restructuring advice to Blackstone and Goldman Sachs. That is on top of \u00a330m spent on advisers by Punch former chief executive Ian Dyson, who remains a non-executive director, in order to demerger the company's managed pub division Spirit Group. The aspect of Punch's restructuring proposal that has stuck in the craw for many senior bondholders is what they believe are overgenerous terms offered to junior bondholders. Critics have suggested certain hedge funds have used their influence as major Punch shareholders to extract more favourable terms from junior bonds \u2013 where they also hold an interest. Punch's share register is dominated by Glenview Capital, Luxor Capital, Octavian Special Opportunities, Alchemy Special Opportunities and Avenue Capital. Punch management has been able to keep the business from falling into the hands of bondholders by dipping into cash reserves, held outside of Punch's two over-indebted pub estate divisions, transferring the funds to the stretched operating subsidiaries. The group continues to hold \u00a358m outside of these two zombie pub estate divisions, but accepts the situation is unsustainable. Billingham acknowledged the specifics of Punch's complex, 16-tiered capital structure had gifted a strong bargaining position to junior bondholders in the restructuring negotiations. But he claimed this was because of the unusually generous rights attached to such bonds in the event of a default \u2013 and not because of any pressure brought to bear by shareholders with a vested interest. \"I have had some very difficult discussions with shareholders \u2013 they're US hedge fund dogs.\" Bondholders will vote on 14 February.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Vodafone takes a stand on privacy with plan to disclose wiretapping demands", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vodafone is to take a stand on privacy by asking British ministers, and the governments of each of the 25 countries in which it operates, for the right to disclose the number of demands it receives for wiretapping and customer data. In a push back against the use of telecoms networks for mass surveillance, as revealed by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, Vodafone is to write to the home secretary, Theresa May, and the justice secretary, Chris Grayling, demanding greater transparency. \"We want all of our customers worldwide to feel they are at liberty to communicate with each other as they see fit. We want our networks to be big and busy withpeople who are confident they can communicate with each other freely; anything that inhibits that is very bad for any commercial operator,\" said Vodafone's privacy head, Stephen Deadman. Vodafone says British law currently prevents it from sharing even general information on wiretapping. Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa), discussing the existence of a warrant is punishable by five years in prison. The company wants to follow its American counterparts AT&amp;T and Verizon, and digital groups including Google, Microsoft and Facebook, in publishing regular transparency reports. US companies have committed to twice-yearly updates on how many surveillance requests they receive from each government around the world, whether those requests are for the content of calls or emails, or for the so-called metadata such as names, addresses, locations, dates and phone numbers. Vodafone would like to disclose surveillance requests in its annual sustainability report, due to be published in June. Deadman said: \"Where governments do not and will not disclose, and it is lawful for us to do so, we will disclose our own total aggregate numbers of law-enforcement demands. \"Where it is not lawful for us to disclose we will say so and we will say what provisions of law apply.\" The world's second-largest mobile phone company, Vodafone operates in more than 25 markets including India, Turkey and South Africa, but the UK is among the markets where disclosure is most restricted. Alongside the requests, Vodafone will publish a set of government surveillance principles, which will be displayed on its website and translated into several languages. The key points, shown to the Guardian, state that Vodafone: \u2022 Will not allow access to customer data unless legally obliged to do so \u2022 Will not go beyond what is required under the law \u2022 Will not accept any instruction from an agency foreign to the country in which it is being asked to allow surveillance \u2022 Will challenge requests in law where appropriate \u2022 Will honour international human rights standards as much as possible where these conflict with domestic standards. The British government publishes some surveillance statistics, via the office of the Interception of Communications Commissioner, whose job it is to check warrants are issued lawfully and that the wrong individuals are not targeted by mistake. In 2012, security concerns around the Olympics led to a marked rise in the number of surveillance notices. There were 570,000 authorisations for metadata, a 16% increase on the previous year, and 3,370 warrants for content interception, a 15% increase on 2011. But the commissioner cannot share how many individuals were targeted by those requests, and it is unclear how mass interceptions such as those made under Tempora \u2013 a clandestine electronic surveillance programme operated by GCHQ \u2013 are counted. Section 19 of the Ripa regulations, under which agencies ranging from the police to local councils can make requests, sets out the offence of unauthorised disclosure, saying where a warrant has been issued, telecoms companies must \"keep secret \u2026 the existence and contents of the warrant\". Section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 says companies cannot disclose if ministers believe disclosure would be \"against the interests of national security or relations with the government of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom, or the commercial interests of some other person\". Deadman said Vodafone would not be transparent about surveillance in each of the markets in which it operates, because disclosure could compromise the safety of its staff or cause the company to lose its licence to operate. AT&amp;T and Verizon agreed at the end of last year to publish transparency reports after pressure from shareholders. These were pioneered by Google in 2010 and campaign groups Access and Big Brother Watch have called on British companies to do the same.",

Their comments came as a new opinion poll for the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IME) found that 47% of people would be unhappy for a gas well site using fracking to open within 10 miles of their home, compared with just 14% who said they would be happy. The findings come just days after the prime minister announced that councils that back fracking will get to keep more money from the business tax revenues once production at a well is under way. The biggest concerns for the people polled included fears of damage to the local environment, the associated noise and disruption, fears over the chemicals used and health risks, as well as fears that drinking water might be contaminated. Tim Fox, head of energy and environment at the IME, said: \"These poll results suggest that simply offering money to local councils and communities is not enough to convince the public about the benefits of fracking for gas and that much more work needs to be done to engage with citizens on this potential activity. \"Building trust between government, industry and communities is essential if we wish to make use of this technique in shale rocks under the UK.\" The Guardian carried out the first UK nationwide poll on shale last summer and found people split down the middle, 40% in favour of shale drilling in their area, 40% against, with 20% unsure.

Risk and reward must be much more closely aligned, as the Banking Commission recommended.</p> <p>\u201cThe Governor of the Bank of England today agreed with the Banking Commission\u2019s conclusion that a crude bonus cap is not the answer. He told us that the PRA will launch a consultation in April on changes to the current remuneration code, in order to give effect to our proposals.</p> <p>\u201cThe Governor also agreed with the Commission\u2019s conclusions that the structure of remuneration is more important than the absolute level and that more deferral in variable pay is required.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2>&#xa0;<strong>On competition in banking:</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&#xa0;\u201cCompetition has a crucial role to play in bringing about higher standards in the banking sector. Much more needs to be done to remove barriers to entry. The current oligopoly cannot be allowed to persist.</p> <p>&#xa0;\"Competition can be the most effective regulator and can help secure better outcomes for consumers. Innovation and challenge to markets from new entrants can generate a lot more work for regulators. It is crucial they don\u2019t take the easy option and allow regulation to impede competition.</p> <p>&#xa0;\u201cThe Treasury Committee, the Independent Commission on Banking, Chaired by Sir John Vickers, and the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards all made recommendations to secure greater competition and reduce barriers to entry.</p> <p>&#xa0;\u201cThe job now is to give full effect to these recommendations and give them time to work.</p> <p>&#xa0;But if even these proposals&#xa0;fail to secure greater competition, more radical action would be needed.

It risks undoing the progress made in holding bankers to account if their deals turn sour, he warned.</p> <p><strong>Carney replied \"absolutely\"</strong> when asked if he shared the Vickers Commission's concern about such a crude cap. Instead, the Bank plans to consult on hardening up the existing rules:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We intend to consult to further strengthen to do two things potentially this year, potentially to lengthen the deferral process so that the deferral of compensation is longer than five years ...</p> <p>We would rather see more deferral, more equity and this ability to take it back when those risks come to light.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>On the housing market,</strong> Carney played down fears of a bubble - even though price rises aren't expected to ease off until 2015.&#xa0;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Our general expectation has been for a continuation of current momentum - house price momentum, mortgage activity, credit growth momentum - into 2014, before decelerating around the middle of 2015, towards 2016, towards growth in terms of debt - mortgage and total household debt - more approximating the rate of growth of incomes.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And the governor also denied that <strong>household debts</strong> are approaching a danger zone:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We look at a wide range of metrics of household balance sheets, household indebtedness, actual and perspective. As you can appreciate, there is no one metric that is the predictor of future financial problems. But I would say that while level is important, servicing ability is that much more important ...</p> <p>Rate of change, particularly relative to historic trends, tends to be a better predictor, in terms of credit, aggregates and within specific sectors, tends to be a better predictor of future problems than absolute level.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>He also said Britain will 'fully implement' the new Basel leverage ratio for banks</strong>, but could tweak the precise details - probably imposing slightly tougher rules on systemic banks than the 3% target.</p> <p>Carney said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't want to speak for the committee, but my personal view is we would consider adjustments in calibration as opposed to definition...</p> </blockquote> <p>adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My personal inclination is that we would gross up, not jack up, but gross up whatever the base level is for a ring-fenced bank and for systemic banks in order to ensure that leverage ratio fully performs its function.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Carney also admitted that central bankers and politicians have still not ended the problem that some banks are 'too big to fail'</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the night -- check out our summary at 5.15pm for Mark Carney's criticism of Labour's bid to cap bank bonuses and bring more competition to the financial sector (and other key points from this afternoon's session). Full coverage starts at 2.21pm With Labour pledging to refer the Banks to the competition commission, battle lines are being drawn. Other key events today were the World Bank's decision to upgrade global growth forecasts: 8.13am: World Bank raises growth forecasts, but sees emerging market risks It also warned that emerging markets could suffer painful capital outflows if central banks botch the unwinding of their stimulus plans. 11.53am: On those World Bank emerging market fears.... But there was still optimism in the financial markets, with the FTSE 100 closing at its highest level since May. 5.31pm: Footsie closes at eight-month high And Greece's PM claimed that his country has turned the corner, in a speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg: 2.06pm: Greek PM hails Europe's global vision Back tomorrow..... cheers, and goodnight. GW IMF chief Christine Lagarde is speaking in New York, saying growth is picking up but there's no reason to relax. Andrew Tyrie MP has issued his views on bank bonus caps and competition within the financial sector: On political intervention in RBS: \u201cRBS should be run on commercial grounds. Were decision-making at RBS to be subordinated to political considerations, it would be bad for the bank, bad for the taxpayers\u2019 stake in the bank and bad for the wider economy.\u201d On the bonus cap: \u201cThe structure and scale of remuneration in banking have incentivised misconduct and excessive risk-taking. Risk and reward must be much more closely aligned, as the Banking Commission recommended. \u201cThe Governor of the Bank of England today agreed with the Banking Commission\u2019s conclusion that a crude bonus cap is not the answer. He told us that the PRA will launch a consultation in April on changes to the current remuneration code, in order to give effect to our proposals. \u201cThe Governor also agreed with the Commission\u2019s conclusions that the structure of remuneration is more important than the absolute level and that more deferral in variable pay is required.\u201d On competition in banking: \u201cCompetition has a crucial role to play in bringing about higher standards in the banking sector. Much more needs to be done to remove barriers to entry. The current oligopoly cannot be allowed to persist. \"Competition can be the most effective regulator and can help secure better outcomes for consumers. Innovation and challenge to markets from new entrants can generate a lot more work for regulators. It is crucial they don\u2019t take the easy option and allow regulation to impede competition. \u201cThe Treasury Committee, the Independent Commission on Banking, Chaired by Sir John Vickers, and the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards all made recommendations to secure greater competition and reduce barriers to entry. \u201cThe job now is to give full effect to these recommendations and give them time to work. But if even these proposals fail to secure greater competition, more radical action would be needed. In those circumstances, the Banking Commission made clear that a full Competition Commission inquiry would need to be considered.\u201d Brooks Newmark MP, one of the committee members, tweets: One City analyst points out that we can hardly expect Mark Carney to argue against hard caps for financial sector pay, given his own pay package (he gets a \u00a3480,000 salary, a \u00a3250,000 housing allowance and \u00a3144,000 worth of pension contributions). And he also suggests we treat Carney's views on the medium-term outlook for the UK economy with much suspicion, given the Bank of England \"can\u2019t even forecast the unemployment rate six months forward\" (the jobless rate has fallen much faster than the BoE predicted last summer) In the City, the FTSE 100 closed at its highest levels since last May. Trading floors took comfort from this morning's news that the World Bank has raised its global growth forecasts. Decent results from Bank of America, and the strong US Empire manufacturing survey, also helped push shares up across Europe. My colleague Nick Fletcher reports that the FTSE 100 is now just 111 points shy of its highest ever closing level. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 53 points higher at 6819.86 following news overnight that the World Bank had raised its global economic growth forecasts and Tuesday's better than expected US retail sales. Fears that the US Federal Reserve would continue cutting its $75bn a month bond buying programme, a key support of markets in recent months, were outweighed by the positive economic outlook. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Regardless of concerns about a Fed tapering program, markets in Europe have pushed higher again today with the German Dax once again hitting new all-time highs, as it looks to close in on the 10,000 level, which is now less than 300 points away, despite a disappointing revision to the German 2013 GDP number, while Italian and Spanish markets have managed to push to their highest levels since July 2011. Today's select committee hearing was meant to expose Mark Carney and his colleagues on the Financial Policy Committee to some tough questions about financial stability. But the Bank of England governor's criticism of bank bonus caps, and his warning over breaking up banks, are likely to get the most attention, I reckon. They place Threadneedle Street at odds with Ed Miliband over Britain's financial sector, as the Labour leader puts bank reform at the heart of the political agenda (see Andrew Sparrow's Politics Live blog). Carney dismissed the idea that breaking up banks was necessarily good for consumers, saying: \"Just breaking up an institution doesn't necessarily create a viable or more intensive competitive structure.\" And on bonuses, the governor was critical of Europe's push to cap payments at 100% of a bankers salary. It risks undoing the progress made in holding bankers to account if their deals turn sour, he warned. Carney replied \"absolutely\" when asked if he shared the Vickers Commission's concern about such a crude cap. Instead, the Bank plans to consult on hardening up the existing rules: We intend to consult to further strengthen to do two things potentially this year, potentially to lengthen the deferral process so that the deferral of compensation is longer than five years ... We would rather see more deferral, more equity and this ability to take it back when those risks come to light. On the housing market, Carney played down fears of a bubble - even though price rises aren't expected to ease off until 2015. \"Our general expectation has been for a continuation of current momentum - house price momentum, mortgage activity, credit growth momentum - into 2014, before decelerating around the middle of 2015, towards 2016, towards growth in terms of debt - mortgage and total household debt - more approximating the rate of growth of incomes.\" And the governor also denied that household debts are approaching a danger zone: We look at a wide range of metrics of household balance sheets, household indebtedness, actual and perspective. As you can appreciate, there is no one metric that is the predictor of future financial problems. But I would say that while level is important, servicing ability is that much more important ... Rate of change, particularly relative to historic trends, tends to be a better predictor, in terms of credit, aggregates and within specific sectors, tends to be a better predictor of future problems than absolute level.\" He also said Britain will 'fully implement' the new Basel leverage ratio for banks, but could tweak the precise details - probably imposing slightly tougher rules on systemic banks than the 3% target. Carney said: I don't want to speak for the committee, but my personal view is we would consider adjustments in calibration as opposed to definition... adding: My personal inclination is that we would gross up, not jack up, but gross up whatever the base level is for a ring-fenced bank and for systemic banks in order to ensure that leverage ratio fully performs its function.\" Carney also admitted that central bankers and politicians have still not ended the problem that some banks are 'too big to fail'. He hopes the G20 will make the necessary progress this year. And the Bank of England governor hopes to hold a discussion on independence issues with Scottish first minister Alex Salmond on January 29th, when he visits Edinburgh. Full coverage of the hearing starts at 2.21pm. While I was watching the Treasury committee, our politics editor Patrick Wintour was reporting that Labour will pledge to refer the Britain's high street banks to the competition authorities if it wins the next election. That review could potentially lead to the break-up of the largest UK high street banks, the party reckons. Patrick writes that Ed Miliband will announce the plan on Friday: The aim would be to provide a clear market structure to support better competition for customers and to address obstacles in the way of allowing new players to break into the market. The party also hopes it will help prompt a greater emphasis on German-style regional banking. But the party would not indicate whether it had a specific cap on the size of a retail bank in mind. Labour officials would only say that a clearcut market share cap of 25% \u2013 as had been leaked on Tuesday night \u2013 was wide of the mark. A general reference to the CMA was nearly adopted by the cross-party banking commission chaired by Andrew Tyrie \u2013 but the idea has been rejected in the Commons by the coalition government. However, the Office of Fair Trading in July last year announced a market study on competition in banking for small and medium-sized businesses and said this review would help the CMA decide whether to hold a full inquiry. The Miliband speech on Friday is designed to show he can develop his successful, but arguably fully-mined living standards agenda into a wider route map to greater economic prosperity. It will also aim to do something to exorcise Labour's reputation for having left the City of London insufficiently regulated during its time in office. Labour will refer banks to competition authorities in 2015, Miliband to pledge The session ended after Andrew Tyrie wrong-footed Mark Carney by mentioning a new report showing UK banks are particularly exposed to the Chinese economy. Carney says we shouldn't be surprised, or necessarily worried, that a major financial sector like London is closely involved with a fast-growing market like China. Summary to follow..... Andrew Tyrie then weighs in, asking Richard Sharp (the other external Financial Policy Committee member at the hearing) whether he's given any speeches yet either. Sharp says he has not, and has deliberately resisted speechifying since being appointed last April. He wanted to use the FPC's monthly meetings to gauge the subjects under discussion, and he also has a \"very acute sensitivity\" that some issues are market sensitive* *- that doesn't stop the MPC's external members sounding off... But he seemed to take the point that the Treasury Committee wants the four external members of the FPC to round the country, stirring up interest in financial stability. As the session draws to a close, the external members of the FPC are challenged over whether they are doing a good enough job. John Thurso MP reminds Dame Clara Furse about concerns over her independence (she endured a grilling by the committee last year). Furse replies that she is \"very sorry\" that she gave the wrong impression in the past, and \"absolutely agrees\" that it is extremely important that the FPC is fully independent. Thurso says that the committee are reassured by the way that members of the Monetary Policy Committee (which sets interest rates) go round the country giving speeches that show they disagree. Furse says she has not made any speeches as an FPC member yet, but plans are being made for speeches soon.... We have still not solved the problem of banks being 'too big to fail', says Carney. But 2014 could, and really really should, be the year that the final pieces are put into place. The G20 is committed to making the necessary progress, including agreeing new rules on \"bailing-in\" debt holders (so that taxpayers would no longer be on the hook when a bank failed) When will you be able to look consumers in the eye and say the problem is solved, asks Pat McFadden MP. Governor Carney replies that he hopes proper proposals will be hammered out \"by the end of this year\" Care to bet one of your plastic \u00a310 notes on it?, asks McFadden mischievously. Carney takes the bet -- in 2017 when the new polymer notes hit the streets. By describing the current UK bonus regime as hard touch, from a financial stability perspective\", Mark Carney didn't offer much support to the Labour Party in its campaign to cap bonuses at Royal Bank of Scotland. Now a question on cyber attacks -- has the UK financial system come under electronic attack from another country's government? Mark Carney says he is not away of such an attack. Asked whether such a sovereign attack would be more severe than a criminal attack, Carney says it all depends on the nature of the attack. The Bank takes the situation very seriously, he adds - we have substantially increased our penetration testing (ie, checking the robustness of the UK cyber defences). We need to continue investing in this area, he adds. Mark Carney reveals that the Prudential Regulation Authority is planning to consult on the possibility of lengthening the deferral time before a bankers actually gets their bonus. He describes the current UK regime as \"hard-touch\" from a financial stability perspective. We would like to see more deferral, more equity, and more ability to claw back bonuses, he adds. He also reiterates his concerns about Europe's proposal to peg a bankers' bonus at 100% of salary. It risks surrendering some of the gains made since the crisis, by making it harder to claw back money. Mark Carney adds that many mistakes were made on bank pay in the run-up to the financial crisis - including paying bonuses immediately. The damage created by that short-term culture has afflicted banks for years. Jesse Norman joins the committee room (straight from the debate on Banking reform), and asks Mark Carney whether regulators have dropped the ball on bank bonuses. No, Carney replies.... Would raising interest rates by 200 basis points (for example) threaten financial stability and growth? Mark Carney slightly ducky the question, as it falls into the realm of monetary policy (he's here to discuss financial stability). But, if we raised rates by 200, 300,400, 500 basis points (ie from today's 0.5% to 5.5%), then we would have to look at what would be the risk to financial stability - have we and the system taken precautions - and if not, what can we do about it, he says. Does rising household debt matter? Smiling, Carney said it does matter. However he cautions that while policymakers \"need to have humility when considering risks of future financial crisis\", he is more interested in the rates of change in debt-to-income levels, rather than absolute levels. And they do not alarm him. Mark Carney confirms that he will be visiting Edinburgh at the end of this month, on 29th January, to give a speech. And he hopes to meet with Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, to discuss issues raised by the upcoming referendum on Scottish independence, the governor explains. Bank of England staff are trying to arrange a meeting with Salmond, Carney says. Carney says there is \"will on both sides to have a constructive discussion\". This will give Carney and Salmond a chance to talk about issues such as whether an independent Scotland could share the pound in a 'sterling zone'. A question about the risks of securitisation: Good securitisation allocates risks outside the banking sector in a way that encourages investment, explains Dame Clara Furse. America has proved that it can work well, to drive funding to small firms. More securitisation (creating new debt instruments out of existing loans) isn't necessarily a bad thing if banks are sensible, she suggests. In its most recent financial stability report the Bank spoke about developing \"tools\" to protect financial stability, says Stewart Hosie. Can we have some details? Carney suggests that controls on loan-to-value ratios on new mortgages as one possibility -- they've been used elsewhere for financial stability. But you couldn't introduce tough new LTV caps on just a single group of lenders, or one location within the UK, could you? Carney agrees that you couldn't. We are watching underwriting standards closely, and will act if lending deteriorates and threatens financial stability, Carney pledges. If it poses risks... to borrowers, who engage in borrowing that is inconsistent with repaying their debts - and there's no suggestion this is happening - then it could hit financial stability, the governor explains. Sir Jon Cunliffe says it's not easy to explain why Britain has a housing problem - it's a \"complex\" situation. Another member of the Financial Policy Committee, Richard Sharp, says that the UK's performance on building new houses has been \"lamentable\". Carney chips in too, pointing out that Canada (his native land) builds twice as many new houses each year as Britain. Back to house prices.... why are prices up so much recently? Carney says there is an element of foreign demand in London, but if you strip that out house prices are still rising across the country. Prices did fall as the UK economy went into recession, and there has also been a change in mortgage availability. Dame Clara Furse gets the same question, and replies that \"there is a large element of bounce-back\" following falling prices. Are rising house prices good or bad for the economy? Furse replies that it depends how the asset is being paid for. Household indebtedness has been falling, she points out, and loan-to-value ratios are still around 95%. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie pitches a curveball at Sir Jon Cunliffe, the deputy governor of the Bank of England. Will the EU do what's necessary to implement the Basel rules in full? Cunliffe says his \"informed guess\" is that they will. Europe has until the summer, and some of the differences between Basel and the EC's Capital Requirement Directive are addressed by the new Basel proposal. The Bank of England expects house price momentum to increase through this year, and decelerate in mid-2015, suggests Mark Carney. Removing mortgages lending from the FLS will mean slightly less growth in the mortgage market, he says. Why has mortgage demand surged in the UK, asks David Ruffley. Mark Carney says that mortgage approvals is still below its historic averages, despite rallying in recent months. He says the approvals are being driven by 'housing activity' as transactions pick up from very low levels, adding: The question is whether it will snap back through previous averages Will the Bank of England need to 'taper' the withdrawal of the Funding For Lending scheme to prevent commercial mortgage providers collapsing? No, says governor Carney. Lenders should be able to borrow at affordable rates in the money markets. David Ruffley asks Mark Carney to explain why the Bank of England decided to withdraw mortgages from its Funding For Lending Scheme late last year, meaning banks could no longer get extra-low rates from the Bank of England for loans to households. Carney said the Bank had analysed Mortgage lending data (both the number of mortgages being granted, and the price that banks could borrow at), and concluded the UK housing market no longed needed extra help. But banks can still used FLS to get relief on some mortgages.... Carney agrees that the Bank wanted to allow lenders to get full use of the 'allowances' they had earned through the scheme, rather than reneging on them. But further allowances (which could make it cheaper to borrow from the BoE) can't be earned. When will the relief be withdrawn? When the scheme runs out at the end of this year, says Carney Tyrie points out that bank shares rose on Monday after the latest leverage standards were published. Carney replies that this reflects previous expectations for the standards that banks would have to meet. Onto the latest rules on bank leverage -- tweaked over the weekend by the Basel Committee -- Mark Carney says they will reinforce safety by compelling banks to post more cash against risky derivative assets, not simply \"securities being treated as cash\". Carney says the UK will comply fully with the Basel standards, which he expects will compel banks to hold high-quality equity of at least 3% of their balance sheet. And I imagine we would \"gross up\" the base leverage level for ring-fenced and wholesale banks, he adds -- suggesting important UK banks would face higher standards. Carney's comments on bonus caps won't please Labour, coming on the afternoon that MPs debate pegging payouts at RBS. Onto EU bonus caps -- Tyrie says that the Vickers review into UK banking concluded that limiting bonuses to 100% of basic salary was a crude cap, and therefore not desirable. Does the governor agree? Carney says he does agree, absolutely. After joking that he only remembers the parts of Sir John Vickers' report that he agrees with, Mark Carney says you need to look at the \"whole picture\" when assessing the issue of bank restructuring, including issues such as the risk profile. Just breaking up an institution doesn't necessarily create a more intensive competitive structure, Carney warns. In the US, there has been a rule preventing any bank holding more than 10% of all deposits -- and that didn't prevent the 2008 financial crisis. That limit could arguably have contributed to the crisis by encouraging banks to take on more wholesale funding, Carney points out. Andrew Tyrie begins by asking Mark Carney his views on the two issues of the day -- the structure of the UK banking sector, and bank pay..... Here they come.... Over in Westminster, MPs on the Treasury committee are preparing to question Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, on its latest Financial Stability Report. Carney is appearing alongside Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, and two members of its Financial Policy Committee -- Dame Clara Furse, and Richard Sharp. It will be streamed live here. More on Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 speech to the EU parliament this morning (covered at 9.31am) which our correspondent Helena Smith has been dissecting. Grabbing the opportunity to make a splash on the European stage, the Greek prime minister, a former MEP himself, gave a bravura address that by turns emotional and impassioned attempted to be supranational in spirit, she writes. Just as Britain\u2019s chancellor George Osborne was busily highlighting the bloc\u2019s failings in a speech before the pro-reform Open Europe think tank, Antonis Samaras was telling his own audience in Strasbourg that \u201cEurope is a super-power of global vision.\u201d In much the same way that its constituent nations had united, putting \u201cbloody wars\u201d behind them, the EU had disproved the Cassandras by \u201covercoming its weaknesses, seeing its faults and correcting them.\u201d \u201cWe have proved that during the crisis and because of the crisis a United Europe works,\u201d said the Greek leader adding that it was now time to complete the changes put in place over the last two years. \u201cThe crisis has shown us we need more and better Europe \u2026. Two generations ago, the dream of a United Europe seemed unthinkable.\u201d Although twice bailed out Greece remains the euro zone\u2019s weakest member state, it sees its six-month stint at the helm of the EU as a chance to prove it can contribute to the bloc \u2013 indicative of its motto: \u201cour common quest.\u201d By deftly turning its own struggles into a European success story \u2013 Samaras was not slow to remind Euro parliamentarians of the huge sacrifices recession-racked Greece has made to remain in the EU \u2013 it also hopes to slay the naysayers by proving it is a \u201cnormal country.\u201d Posting a primary budget surplus (tellingly announced by Athens\u2019 deputy finance minister on the eve of the speech) is part of the story; falling spreads on Greek government bonds are another. And if the debt-stricken country returns to international capital markets later this year, as the Samaras government very much hopes, that will be another. What the Greek prime minister proved today is that over the course of the next six months, Athens will play up all three. HS There are mixed signals about the state of the economy in Northern Ireland today with Oxfam warning in a report that the politics of austerity is driving more people in the region into poverty. Henry McDonald, our Ireland Correspondent, reports: New research by Oxfam found that 22% of the population are now living in poverty with even 25% of those in work not even making a living wage. The lowest earners have seen a drop of 38% in their disposal incomes in the age of austerity, the charity said. The region has sustained \u00a34bn in cuts which Oxfam says is the biggest reduction in public spending since World War Two. Jim Clarken of Oxfam Ireland urged the UK government and the Northern Ireland Executive at Stormont to \"row back\" on deep-cutting economic policies \"We are now facing hardships our grandparents faced,\" he said. But there was some optimistic news on the jobs front in east Belfast with the securing of a military contract to Indonesia for arms making firm Thales, Henry adds: David Cameron said the deal to supply Starstreak missiles and radar systems to Indonesia was great news for Thales 500 workers. Thales said the Prime Minister personally intervened to help secure the order with the Indonesian military. Thales was originally Shorts Missiles Defence until it was taken over the French owned Thales in 2001. Thales UK CEO Victor Chavez thanked the Prime Minister for \"his personal support and the support of the government\" in winning the contract. A splurge of US economic data floods the wires, including a manufacturing survey that appears to back up the World Bank's optimism. The New York Fed's Empire State index came in at +12.5 in January, much stronger than analysts expected. Its shows activity picked up compared with December, when the index read +2.22. Firms reported an improvement in current business conditions and future prospects, while the new orders index hit a two-year high. Separately, the US Producer Prices index showed a 0.4% rise in December. That's the biggest rise since June, showing that firms paid more for their raw materials. But over the last year, prices are up just 1.2%, showing little inflationary pressure. Most of December's PPI rise was due to higher gasoline costs, which rose 2.2%, while wholesale food prices fell 0.6% -- thanks to a chunky drop in pineapple prices. Reuters explains: Food prices were held down by the cost of pineapples, which recorded their biggest drop since May 2006. Pork prices also weighed, dropping by the most since September 2012.Tobacco prices rose 3.6 percent. Passenger car prices, which rose 0.2 percent, and light truck prices, which advanced 0.5 percent, also helped to lift the core PPI. Bank of America's chief financial officer, Bruce Thompson, was upbeat after today's jump in profit, saying: Capital and liquidity are at record levels, credit losses are at historic lows, our cost savings initiatives are on track and yielding significant savings, and our businesses are seeing good momentum. Over in New York, Bank of America has reported a strong rise in profits as it leaves the aftermath of the financial crisis behind. It made $3.44bn in the last three months, up from $732m in the fourth quarter of 2012 (when it had to pay over $11bn in legal expenses). The results suggest Bank of America is benefitting from the upturn in the US economy -- it set aside just $336m as provisions against credit losses, down from $2.2bn a year ago. Revenue during the quarter rose to $22.32bn from $19.6bn, beating forecasts of $21.2bn Its shares are tipped to rise 2% when Wall Street opens. The results weren't completely free from legal costs - with BoA reporting a pre-tax litigation expense of $2.3bn. It blamed its \"continued evaluation of legacy exposures\" from lawsuits related to mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. Burberry remains the biggest riser in London after those strong Christmas trading figures. Here's the top shares on the FTSE 100: Back in the financial markets, Germany's DAX index hit yet another record high this morning as investors took comfort in the World Bank's upgraded forecasts for global growth. This pushed the FTSEurofirst 300 benchmark index to its highest level since before Lehman Brothers foundered. In the City, the FTSE hit a two and a half-month high, up 27 points to 6794. David Madden, market analyst at IG, says London trading desks got a fillip from the World Bank: Equity markets welcomed the international financial organisation's outlook for 2014, in which it raised its global growth forecasts for the year. Strong German GDP figures gave the Frankfurt market fuel to surge ahead of its European counterparts. In London, Taylor Wimpey posted a 7% increase in sales, as the Help to Buy scheme has paid dividends for UK homebuilders. Tullow Oil raised its revenue and profit forecast, as discoveries in Kenya are expected to boost production. However, the Irish oil exploration company is still surrounded by takeover talk. Burberry is setting the trend this morning. The fashion house revealed a 14% rise in revenues over the last three months of 2013, and it is making additional inroads into China, where two new shops have been opened. Mineral extractor Anglo American is leading the miners higher, and the company was upgraded by UBS. The Swiss investment bank feels the stock is undervalued. Across Europe, financial stocks such as Societe Generale (up 2.8%) and Unicredit (+1.9%) helped lead the rally. This followed confirmation that the European Central Bank's new stress tests won't force lenders to adjust their bond portfolios to match current market prices. Over at Prime Ministers Questions, David Cameron has declared that the government will veto any attempt to increase the total pay bill at Royal Bank of Scotland's investment banking operation. He also said that cash bonuses at RBS will, again, be capped at \u00a32,000. Labour's Ed Miliband, though, repeatedly asked whether RBS bankers' bonuses will be limited to 100% of basic salary. Surely a \u00a31m bonus is enough for someone already taking home \u00a31m? Cameron wouldn't commit, though, saying that total pay is the important issue. Don't miss Andrew Sparrow's analysis of George Osborne's speech on European Union reform - he reckons the chancellor made a constructive case against Britain leaving the EU: Overnight the Treasury released extracts from the speech showing that Osborne would deliver a stark \"reform or we quit\" message to the UK. And it was in there; the language about the European way of life being under threat was strong. But, when you get the chance to read the full text, you realise that this was tempered by plenty of comments that were rather positive about EU developments. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit agrees that some emerging markets could suffer as the US Federal Reserve stops pumping tens of billions of dollars into the world economy each month. These charts, from today's World Bank forecasts, shows how capital surged into the emerging markets before the 2008 crash, and swept out again as the financial world wobbled. And here's more details of the World Bank's concerns about a potential disorderly unwinding of QE by the world's central banks: According to simulations, abrupt changes in market expectations, resulting in global bond yields increasing by 100 to 200 basis points within a couple of quarters, could lead to a sharp reduction in capital inflows to developing countries by between 50 and 80 percent for several months. Some developing countries could face crisis risks should such scenario unfold. Focusing on an assessment of prevalent factors in past banking crises, evidence suggests that countries having seen a substantial expansion of domestic credit over the last five years, deteriorating current account balances, high levels of foreign and short-term debt and over-valued exchange rates could be more at risk in current circumstances. Labour's bid to block RBS from handing large bonuses to senior banks have not impressed the CBI. Its director general, John Cridland, wants pay to be set in boardrooms, not Westminster, saying: The judgement on bonuses for RBS must be whether the leadership team can continue to motivate and attract the specialist talent required for the bank to do its job effectively as a lender to the economy. IHS Global Insight's Howard Archer says the eurozone's increased trade surplus in November (see here) is encouraging. He believe growth in the euro area picked up in the last three months of 2013 to perhaps +0.3%, from +0.1% in the third quarter. Hopes that Eurozone GDP growth picked up in the fourth quarter have been lifted by an improved trade surplus in November which follows on from news that industrial production rebounded markedly in November. But in an echo of the World Bank's concerns about Europe (see opening post), Archer predicts eurozone growth will lag behind this year: Growth prospects for 2014 are starting to look a bit brighter although we still suspect that the Eurozone will struggle to grow by more than 1.0%. The investigation into whether currency traders conspired to rig foreign exchange rates has take a twist -- the FT's Alice Ross reports that Deutsche Bank has suspended several staff today. They're understood to be based in New York. The eurozone's trade surplus swelled in November, due to another slide in imports. The countries which share the euro had a net surplus of \u20ac17.1bn, up sharply from the \u20ac12.5bn in November 2012. Imports were down 5% compared with a year ago, while exports fell by 2% That pushed the eurozone's total trade surplus for the first 11 months of last year to \u20ac139bn, nearly double year-on-year. So far this year, Eurozone exports are up 1%, while imports are down 4%, reflecting the 'rebalancing' in those countries experiencing austerity programmes. Eurostat also released detailed results for the European Union for January-October, which confirmed that Germany ran the biggest trade surplus, and the UK racked up the largest deficit: Concerning the total trade of Member States, the largest surplus was observed in Germany (+\u20ac166.3bn in January-October 2013), followed by the Netherlands (+\u20ac45.5bn), Ireland (+\u20ac31.3bn), Italy (+\u20ac23.7bn), Belgium and the Czech Republic (both +\u20ac11.9bn). The United Kingdom (-\u20ac66.5bn) registered the largest deficit, followed by France (-\u20ac63.5bn), Greece (-\u20ac16.2bn) and Spain (-\u20ac12.8bn). The report (online here) also shows that Europe made little progress in building trade with China. Exports from the European Union into China rose by just 1%, while imports into the EU from Chinese firms declined by 5%. Britain's banks are back in the spotlight today, as Labour's leader Ed Miliband tries to block Royal Bank of Scotland from paying large bonuses to its staff. Ahead of a major speech on Friday, Miliband has called a Commons vote this afternoon to prevent RBS (in which the government owns a majority stake) paying bonuses of more than 100% of a bankers salary. The shadow Treasury secretary, Chris Leslie, told BBC Today programme that Britain's needs to ditch its \"high-rolling bonus culture\": We have got to move to a sustainable professional stable form of banking if we are going to earn our way out of this cost-of-living hole we are in and if we are to help the small businesses get the finances they need to build a better economy. And we have got to have more competition in the banking sector. \"We have a situation where customers feel, 'what is the point of switching?' It is no wonder that people stay with one bank account. Apparently you are more likely to get divorced than change bank account. We have got to give customers more choice. Fees and charges are too high and there is not enough hunger in the banks to serve customers.\" Labour sources, though, have been playing down reports that the party wants to prevent any bank controlling more than 25% of the market (as was reported last night). Here's the full story: Ed Miliband to switch focus from cost of living to banking reform George Osborne also says there's a 'very real risk' of eurozone countries pushing through badly-drafted laws on financial services that would hurt the City. And on the euro itself, he's pushing for eurozone leaders to reinforce the single currency before the crisis flares up again Andrew Sparrow's liveblog has the quotes: The euro has to be put on firmer foundations, for the crisis in the Eurozone may have abated, but the contradictions it revealed are not yet resolved. We should use this moment of relative tranquillity in markets to build those foundations for the future. Speaking of Europe, chancellor George Osborne is calling for the European Union to take major economic and political reforms, or else the UK could quit the EU. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is live-blogging the speech, and the reaction: George Osborne's speech on EU reform: Politics live blog Here's a flavour of Osborne's speech, at a conference organised by Open Europe Look at welfare. As Angela Merkel has pointed out, Europe accounts for just over 7 per cent of the world\u2019s population, 25 per cent of its economy, and 50 per cent of global social welfare spending. We can\u2019t go on like this. And here's a few more key points: Some MEPs gave Antonis Samaras a rough ride after the Greek PM's upbeat speech (see last post). Hannes Swoboda, the senior Social Democrat in the European Parliament, showed little sympathy for the Greek PM's challenge, while Green leader Rebecca Harms blasted him for allowing the population to suffer so badly: Jurgen Baetz of Associated Press has the quotes: Over in Strasbourg, Greece's prime minister has been addressing MEPs and outlining his priorities for the country's six-month EU presidency which began this month. There was much applause as Antonis Samaras told the European parliament that \"we have delivered\" and \"honoured our agreement\" and in the process suffered the biggest loss of economic output since the 1930's. Samaras declared: \"We have pulled off the biggest reduction in debt without suffering bankruptcy. Eighteen months ago our country was on the brink of catastrophe and many thought we would leave the eurozone...and the eurozone would disintegrate ... but we have proved that Europe could hold its own and come through.\" (translation by our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith). Samaras added that his first priority for the next six months was tackling Europe's chronic unemployment crisis. Although Burberry enjoyed a bumper Christmas, chief executive Angela Ahrendts was cautious this morning - saying that its 14% revenue growth was mainly due to strong online demand, rather than on the high street. Ahrendts also sees challenges this year, as my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports: She warned that fluctuating exchange rates would be \"a significant headwind\" from the second half of the year, while the \"macro environment\" remained uncertain. Germany's Federal Statistics Office has already highlighted why we need to see faster growth this year. It reported that the German economy expanded by just 0.4% during the whole of 2013, as the eurozone debt crisis choked growth in its largest member. Economists had expected growth of 0.5% -- which would still have been pretty lacklustre. Roderich Egeler, President of the Federal Statistical Office, told reporters that: \"Obviously, the German economy suffered from the continuing recession in some European countries and from restrained growth of the global economy. The strong domestic demand could offset those factors only to a limited extent\". As this chart shows, Germany's growth rate has slowed for the last two years - it almost fell into recession in early 2013. The Federal Statistics Office also warned that German trade was rather \"less dynamic\" than usual last year, due to the continuing difficult external economic environment. Exports only rose by 0.6%, while imports were up 1.3%. The World Bank's new growth forecasts have acted like a balm to anxious traders in Europe too, with leading shares across the region hitting their highest level since mid-2008. The main markets are all up in early trading, sending the FTSEurofirst 300 up 0.2 to 1,329 - last seen in the nervous months before the financial crisis blew up. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets comments: \ufeffGlobal sentiment will likely take solace from the World Bank upping its global growth forecasts for 2014 and 2015 based on a recovery by richer nations but cuts its2014 growth in the developing world and China. All the main indices have risen, with the FTSE 100 gaining 21 points at 6,789, a rise of 0.3%. It is led by Burberry, which cheered the City with strong financial results this morning (revenues jumped 14% in the Christmas trading period). Germany's DAX rose 0.9%, and Italy's FTSE MIB is up 0.8%. Japan's stocks rallied overnight, with the Nikkei rising 2.5% -- clawing back almost all the losses racked up on Tuesday when investors were fretting about economic prospects. The World Bank also predicted that China's economic growth will slow. It sees GDP growth 'flat' at +7.7% this year, slowing to 7.5% in 2015 and 2016. It cautioned: The region is vulnerable to risks of disorderly unwinding in Chinese investment and abrupt tightening in global financing conditions. Commodity exporters are also vulnerable to sharper than expected declines in commodity prices. That helped to weaken the Australian dollar, which had already slipped against the US dollar following decent American retail sales data. Traders feared that Australia's mining sector would suffer if China wobbled. More here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and the business world. The World Bank has set the tone for the day, declaring that the global economy has reached a turning point, but warning that emerging markets could suffer as monetary policy returns to normality. In its latest forecasts, released while much of Europe was sleeping, the Bank raised its forecasts for global economic growth for the first time in three years. Half a decade after the collapse of Lehman Brothers plunged the world into the biggest financial crisis in generations, there are signs that the world economy is \"bouncing back\". But while it sees faster growth in developed nations, the Bank is more nervous about the emerging markets -- especially as major central banks withdraw stimulus measures. Europe remains a concern too, although the Bank sees growth picking up in richer nations as austerity measures are eased. Kaushik Basu, its chief economist, declared: Global economic indicators show improvement. But one does not have to be especially astute to see there are dangers that lurk beneath the surface. The Euro Area is out of recession but per capita incomes are still declining in several countries. We expect developing country growth to rise above 5 percent in 2014, with some countries doing considerably better, with Angola at 8 percent, China 7.7 percent, and India at 6.2 percent. But it is important to avoid policy stasis so that the green shoots don't turn into brown stubble. European stock markets are expected to rally this morning, as the World Bank report reassures fears that growth was stumbling. Here's the key points of today's forecasts: The world economy will grow by 3.2% in 2014, up from the 3.0% the Bank predicted in June last year. That shows acceleration from 2.4% growth last year. Global growth will rise to 3.4% in 2015 and 3.5% in 2016... But developing nations will grow by 5.3% in 2014, down from a previous forecast 5.6%. The World Bank said 'high-income countries' will grow by 2.2% this year, up from 1.5% in 2013, as \"drag on growth from fiscal consolidation and policy uncertainty\" continues to ease. But the Bank also sounded an alarm about the impact on developing nations as the huge quantitative easing programmes that have supported the economies and financial markets of major nations are wound in. Slowing and unwinding QE could cause disruption and slash the amount of capital flowing into emerging markets by up to 80%. As economics editor Larry Elliott explains: The Washington-based bank said a severely negative response to the return of monetary policy to normal might lead to capital flows to emerging markets falling by up to 80% for several months. The bank said growth prospects were brighter this year than they had been in 2013 but the first co-ordinated expansion in five years in the west's \"big three\" economies \u2013 the US, Japan and euro region \u2013 had the potential to cause problems elsewhere in the global economy. Here's Larry's full take: Developing countries could be 'starved' of capital as financial stimulus ends The Federal Reserve took its first step towards slowing its stimulus programme last month, and could stop buying any new bonds by the end of this year. The bank said this 'tapering process ' would only cause a modest impact on developing countries, as long as it was handled in an orderly way, but.... \"However, should the adjustment be disorderly, as it was in response to speculation about when a taper might begin during the spring and summer of 2013, interest rates could rise more quickly. \"In such a scenario, countries that have large current account deficits, large proportions of external debt and those that have had big credit expansions, would be among the most vulnerable.\" The full report is online here: Global Economic Prospects I'll pull together more reaction to the World Bank's views, and all the other action through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Mobile phones and tablet computers are now used for nearly 6% of all retail sales as Brits embrace shopping from the sofa, the train and under the duvet. While total online sales rose 18% year-on-year in December to \u00a311.1bn, according to the latest figures from e-tail industry body IMRG and advisory firm Capgemini, sales via mobile devices doubled to \u00a33bn. \"Sales via mobiles will continue to rise in 2014, this is now mainstream,\" said Chris Webster, head of retail at Capgemini. He said that the adoption of hand-held technology, as well as the development of click-and-collect\" services, which enable shoppers to order online and then pick up their purchases at a convenient store, had accelerated the switch from the high street to online. \"What we usually see when a market matures is that the rate of growth slows, but it is accelerating,\" Webster said. IMRG is predicting that this year total online sales will rise by 17% to \u00a3107bn after rising 16% to \u00a391bn last year. Shoppers' switching to the internet is already having a huge impact on traditional retailers who are having to invest millions of pounds in creating logistics networks and IT systems to cope with delivery of online orders while sales in stores fall back. Those retailers without a strong online presence, such as supermarket Morrisons, had a very poor Christmas. But the switch to mobile shopping is causing other potentially longlasting changes. Retailers said easy-to-use and now cheap tablet computers such as Tesco's Hudl were opening up online shopping to a much broader range of consumers, including the less well-off and older. \"Tablet computers are lowering the barriers to entry. People not comfortable with technology are comfortable with tablets which are more tactile,\" said Andrew McClelland from IMRG. Sean McKee, head of e-commerce at footwear chain Schuh, added: \"Some 75-year-old shoppers are doing their first transactions online via iPads.\" With shoppers carrying the technology around in their pocket, retailers also have the opportunity to communicate with customers much more frequently, changing buying patterns. Retailers say they now see spikes in online activity late in the evening, as people shop while watching television, or early in the morning as purchases are made before work. Sunday evening is also overtaking Monday as the busiest online shopping day of the week. About 80% of mobile sales come from tablet computers, but sales via smartphones are growing faster as retailers adapt their websites to make it easier to shop from a phone and the technology improves. Sales from smartphones nearly tripled between 2012 and 2013. The increase in sales via mobiles is also helping drive use of click-and-collect services according to Webster, who said shoppers who preferred to buy on the move were less likely to have the kind of lifestyle which enabled them to wait at home for collections. About a quarter of online orders are now collected rather than sent to homes and Webster said growth would continue. Mark Lewis, online director at department store John Lewis, said the biggest transformation in retail in 2014 would be the blurring together of all the different shopping channels, from online and mobile to stores, home delivery and collection. \"Customers expect us to offer them a completely seamless service across all touch points and our job is to wire it all together,\" he said. The rise of click-and-collect could be behind a huge growth of home and garden goods sold online. Sales rose by a quarter between December 2012 and December 2013, a pace of growth only matched by lingerie. The next fastest growing category was accessories, such as belts and scarves, followed by electrical goods.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "We are just minutes into Martin Scorsese's financial black comedy, The Wolf of Wall Street, when the investment banker next to me starts slowly shaking his head. On the screen Leonardo DiCaprio's character, the crooked stockbroker Jordan Belfort, is waxing lyrical about his millions, his cars and his trophy wife and combining those two latter passions in a characteristically prurient scene. \"This is what gives the City a bad name,\" says my viewing companion, one of a group of senior City bankers gathered to compare their own career experiences with the excesses in Scorsese's film, released in UK cinemas on Thursday. As the story romps on through lavish beachside parties, office orgies and increasingly criminal dealings, the head shaking and seat-shuffling intensifies. \"I hope that people see this in a historical context and not in the current context,\" says the same banker, who worked in a big investment bank on Wall Street in the 90s before relocating to London. As the credits roll after almost three hours of Belfort's odyssey in the underworld he concludes: \"I would be disappointed if I had paid money to see that because it just isn't real.\" The title fingers Wall Street, but this tale is not about the investment banking world of corporate clients our viewer works in: \"They sold investments to widows and orphans and Jo Schmo on Main Street,\" he adds. The bond market expert in our party is less quick to distance his industry from Scorsese's tale. \"We are only five years on from the crisis, so I wouldn't pretend it was ancient history,\" he insists. For this banker, in the industry since 1981, several elements of the film ring true: conferences in glamorous locations, drunken lunches and the rambling pep talks before crucial deals. The wild chanting for the\"Wolf\" by enraptured staff was reportedly echoed on real-life Wall Street when Morgan Stanley's John Mack returned to the bank in 2005 after a stint at Credit Suisse First Boston. More recently there have been accounts of trading floors in thrall to former Barclays boss Bob Diamond's rallying cries. The junkets and lunches are now largely in the past, says the bond man. So is he worried about this latest take on the criminal side of banking will misrepresent the City? \"I am not sure people's opinions of bankers can sink a lot lower, but the comedy makes it appear to me a work of fiction,\" he says. The fund manager next to him reckons it will be grist to the mill for banker bashers: \"I imagine that people who are pissed off about bankers will read into it what they want to because it plays to lots of prejudices. But anyone vaguely familiar with the financial services industry would see it as a historical parody,\" says the 56-year-old, also in the markets since the early 80s. He questions how the virtually non-stop drug-taking and drinking tallies with an industry known for early starts. \"There aren't that many people who can cope with large amounts of alcohol and get up in the morning and go to work,\" he says. Meanwhile our man from Wall Street remembers being asked to pee into a cup for random tests designed to identify the drug-assisted bankers. Terence Winter, the writer who adapted Belfort's book for the screen has said the film is proof of \"how history repeats itself, how we are not learning from our mistakes.\" He told the Hollywood Reporter: \"It is just holding a mirror up to what is still going on.\" Our fund manager feels the story of greed and fraud at Stratton Oakmont brokerage is stretched well beyond the realm of possibility: \"In reality people working in finance today are working in an immensely regulated environment.\" Strong female characters are few and far between in the film and if our little grouping of 2014 bankers is anything to go by, not that much has changed. Our one female viewer, a former City lawyer, says the profane banter in the film is familiar from trading floors \u2013 but she too thinks the movie is an overt parody. \"They are packed in like sardines in the trading floor scenes. That just adds to the fiction,\" she says. The banker viewing panel reckons that audience attitudes have done an about-turn since Michael Douglas portrayed Gordon Gekko In Wall Street, back in 1987. The law-bending Gekko was regarded less as an villain and more as an inspiration, says the former Wall Street man. \"If you look at Wall Street and Gordon Gekko, that had an effect of 'God, I want to do that. Greed is good. \"Now, if you look at the younger generation and they are confronted with this, they treat it very differently. They have been sensitized to what is unacceptable.\" So are there no Gordon Gekkos or Jordan Belforts in this generation? \"The people making immense amounts of money now are the hedge fund managers, who are on the edges of regulation, becoming regulated,\" says our fund manager. \"But even they are not flogging stuff to little old ladies. And they don't look like the cast of Wolf of Wall Street. They are usually boffinish and work incredibly hard.\"",

      "bodyText": "Millions of consumers will be able to use a smartphone app to pay for purchases this year in the latest shift away from cash and card payments. Known as Zapp, the app is due to launch in the autumn and will be available to 18 million UK current account holders with HSBC, First Direct, Nationwide, Santander and Metro Bank. The mobile payment system will only work for online purchases initially, but Peter Keenan, chief executive of Zapp, said he expects it to be enabled for at least one in five store payments from late 2015, meaning that consumers can \"leave their wallets at home\". Zapp will be synchronised with existing online banking apps for smartphones and tablets. It will work by using a code sent to a customer's smartphone when they touch the 'Pay by Zapp' button on a self-checkout touchscreen or tell the cashier at a till that they wish to pay this way. Alternatively, customers will be able to scan a code into the handset from a paper bill or the screen on a modern card machine. The code will contain all the information needed to complete the transaction, including the price, and the retailer's details and information about the goods being bought, which will appear on your mobile screen. Once a customer has opened the mobile banking app on their phone the transaction can be completed, with testing by Zapp suggesting the whole process will take about 12 seconds. If a customer is shopping online from a tablet, going to the checkout will launch the app to pay, while if they are using a PC then websites can send a notification to the customer's phone which will launch Zapp. Keenan claims Zapp is more secure than current card payments as it does not require users to share their card numbers with third parties. \"It is engineered so that it doesn't have to share any information with the retailer,\" he said. Banks also claim the technology will be safer, as the unique code for that purchase will expire after three minutes. Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, said: \"The days of cash and debit cards could be numbered. The ease of managing everything \u2013 your diary to online payments \u2013 from your smartphone with mobile payment technology, could see the wallet become a thing of the past. \"For those worried about the security issues of paying from your mobile, Zapp's use of 'digital tokens' \u2013 which mean consumers don't need to reveal any of their details to merchants \u2013 as well as offering the same level of protection as debit cards, should give many consumers the peace of mind they need to embrace this technology and revolutionise how they shop and manage their money.\" Zapp was developed by Vocalink, the group that runs the UK's payments infrastructure and is owned by a consortium of 18 banks and building societies. Barclays offers its own service, Pingit, and there are similar mobile systems from PayPal, Orange and Moneto. However, Telefonica shut down its O2 Wallet service last week, and said it is looking at \"better ways\" for consumers to make payments. The Centre for Economic and Business Research said that it estimates 20 million people will use their mobiles to pay for goods and services by the end of the decade.",

So Tullow's shares were slipping all over the place during the day before closing 6.5p higher at 863p.</p> <p>Barclays was positive on the company, saying:</p> <blockquote> With a programme that currently includes over 40 exploration and appraisal wells and material opportunities in Kenya, West Africa and Norway, we re- iterate our overweight rating with a price target up by 1% to \u00a315 a share. <br> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 53 points higher at 6819.86 following news overnight that the World Bank had raised its global economic growth forecasts and Tuesday's better than expected US retail sales. Fears that the US Federal Reserve would continue cutting its $75bn a month bond buying programme, a key support of markets in recent months, were outweighed by the positive economic outlook. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote> Regardless of concerns about a Fed tapering program markets in Europe have pushed higher again today with the German Dax once again hitting new all-time highs, as it looks to close in on the 10,000 level, which is now less than 300 points away, despite a disappointing revision to the German 2013 GDP number, while Italian and Spanish markets have managed to push to their highest levels since July 2011. <br> The extra impetus would appear to be as a result of the decision by the World Bank to upgrade its growth forecasts for developed markets for 2014 and 2015. </blockquote> <p>There were also some upbeat trading statements, notably <strong>Burberry. </strong>The luxury goods group added 68p to \u00a315.37 after it reported a 14% rise in retail sales to \u00a3528m in the three months to the end of December. Analysts had been expecting a figure of around \u00a3520m for the third quarter.

Laura Ashley is believed to have paid around 45p for the bulk of its stake so the sale of 9.5m shares at 84p each means it has nearly doubled its initial investment. Moss Bros closed 4p higher at 94.5p.</p> <p>Mining shares were mixed despite the upbeat reports on the global economy, but <strong>Anglo American</strong> added 70p to 1332.5p as UBS raised its recommendation from neutral to buy. It said:</p> <blockquote> Anglo has underperformed the other diversified miners by 18% over the last three months, and, in our opinion, the valuation now looks attractive with the dividend yield at 4.1% and price/net present value at 0.64 times.

As part of the retail distribution review, fund managers will be banned from paying commissions to distribution platforms aimed at retail investors. The new rules, which come into effect in April, will cost Hargreaves up to \u00a317m in costs and lost revenues.</p> <p><strong>Imperial Tobacco</strong> was down 68p at \u00a321.85 after its shares went ex-dividend.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, <strong>CSR</strong> closed 15p lower at 680p as Korea's Samsung sold a 4.9% stake in the UK chipmaker. Samsung received the shares in July 2012 as part of a deal to buy CSR's mobile phone handset division. The 9.9m shares were placed at 660p each, netting Samsung a profit of around \u00a342m.</p> <p>Finally <strong>Firestone Diamonds</strong> was in sparkling form after raising $222.4m to fund the building of the main treatment plant at its Liqhobong mine in Lesotho, jumping nearly 25% to 4p. Northland Capital said:</p> <blockquote> A very positive development for Firestone Diamonds and we expect this to be seen as a major share price catalyst for the company. The total funding package should be enough to cover the capex of $185m and working capital to move the mine to full production. The company now expects to be able to bring the main treatment plant at the Liqhobong Diamond Mine into production by 2016. <br> </blockquote> <p>SP Angel analysts were also upbeat about the news:</p> <blockquote> This is a well organised fund raise. It is supported by two strong shareholders Pacific Road and RCF VI and secures all the funding required to build the plant and support working capital through the project. Existing shareholders are subscribing for 30% of the funds raised and the full equity component of the fund raise is 45%. This would have been dilutive if two large shareholders had not come in to support this raise at a price which is not significantly lower than the current share price. <br> We have been supporters of this project and with development funding in place the company is now well placed. Liqhobong has scope for large diamonds as well as a smaller package of stones which appeal to the lower end of the market supported by analysis of the 325,000 carats during the operation of the pilot plant and the large stones that were broken during the recovery process. </blockquote>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "1 What problem is Ed Miliband trying to solve by capping RBS bonuses at 100% of salary? In entirely predictable fashion, most big UK banks will seek to bypass the EU's 100%-of-salary bonus cap in two ways. First, they will ask shareholders to grant specific authority to extend the cap to 200%, as the EU law allows. Second, they will invent new ways of supplementing salaries and bonuses. Barclays, for example, is preparing to launch a monthly non-pensionable \"allowance\" that could be paid in cash or shares. Many will regard the banks' reaction as an underhand or devious response to the EU rules. Fair point: few are generating returns that would justify, economically speaking, fat bonuses. But the design of the EU law was deeply flawed. It was inevitable that banks would react to a bonus cap by inflating salaries or dressing up payments in new clothes. How would Miliband stop RBS doing exactly the same thing? If he succeeds in limiting bonus payments at RBS to 100% of salary, he may end up ensuring that every high-earner at the bank receives an increase in his or her fixed pay, or a payment that substitutes for a salary increase. Is he prepared to tolerate that? If not, how would he prevent it? 2 Why just RBS? The state also owns 33% of Lloyds Banking Group. Why isn't Miliband arguing that those shares should also be voted against any attempt by management to secure a 200%-of-salary cap? The bonus problem is more acute at RBS since it runs an investment bank, albeit one smaller than it once was. But Lloyds will also have a few bankers expecting to collect big bonuses. Why isn't Labour applying its argument about bonuses, which it says flow from the \"cost of living crisis,\" to Lloyds? 3 Why is 25% the right maximum for a bank's market share? In the current account market, imposing a 25% maximum would not unleash a new wave of competitive forces. Lloyds, after the spin-off of 631 branches badged TSB (as ordered by the EU), will sit at 26%. The sale of another 50 or so would get Lloyds under 25%. A more radical proposal to promote competition would see Lloyds ordered to sell Halifax, which is absurdly promoted as a \"challenger\" brand even though it sits within the UK's biggest banking organisation. Ordering the sale of Halifax, though, would draw attention to the fact that the last Labour government, in the middle of the meltdown of parent firm HBOS, allowed (and perhaps encouraged) Lloyds' purchase. But liberating Halifax might be the right thing to do if Miliband is serious about promoting competition. In the business banking market, RBS has a share of about 30%. But forcing a sale of assets to reduce that figure below 25% would probably damage the value of the state's 81% holding in RBS. If Miliband is prepared to accept that consequence (as perhaps he should in the interests of the long-term health of the UK economy) he should acknowledge there is a short-term cost. He should also spell out how long the process of reshaping RBS might take. The bank's computer systems seem to have been such a mess that it has taken half a decade and \u00a31bn to separate 300 branches, to be badged Williams &amp; Glyn's, and get them into a position where they can be sold. 4 Why is he convinced that more regional banks are a good idea? Regional banks tend to inspire warm feelings about the supposed good old days of banking, when lending decisions were made by branch managers with real authority and day-to-day knowledge of local businesses. It does not necessarily work that way. Many German Landesbanks, in search of higher returns, disgraced themselves by rushing headlong into the US sub-prime mortgage crisis. Many troubled Spanish cajas were infected by cronyism. Local politicians demanded that loans be granted to their pet construction projects. Spain is still cleaning up the mess. Note, too, that in the UK, Handlesbanken, the large Swedish bank that gets rave reviews from the Bank of England because of its local decision-making, runs a national network. On-the-spot lending decisions do not necessarily imply regional banks. 5 What evidence is there that customers want to switch banks? The shadow Treasury secretary, Chris Leslie, speaking on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday morning, trotted out the standard statistic that we are more likely to get divorced than change bank account. The implication is that the UK public is crying out to change banks but is deterred by the hassle. But a new system to allow seven-day switching, and minimise disruption with direct debits and standing orders, was introduced last year with a blitz of consumer advertising. Is Labour saying this reform, only four months old, has failed already? If so, what is the evidence?",

She is being replaced by Burberry's creative head Christopher Bailey. Half a billion pounds was wiped off the company's share price in October as the appointment surprised the City because of Bailey's lack of business experience. Ahrendts said sales growth was in line with the company's expectations. \"This performance reflects continuing strong brand momentum and our team's intense focus on retail execution, supported by a planned increase in investment in marketing, customer service offline and online and our retail portfolio.\" Ahrendts warned that fluctuating exchange rates would be \"a significant headwind\" from the second half of the year, while the \"macro environment\" remained uncertain. Meanwhile, privately owned toy retailer The Entertainer said underlying sales rose 6.93% in the five weeks to December 28 driven by a 93% rise in click &amp; collect sales. The retailer plans 12 new stores in 2014.",

      "bodyText": "Adverse financial market reaction to the end of growth-boosting stimulus policies in the west could leave vulnerable developing countries starved of capital, according to the World Bank. In its annual Global Economic Prospects, released on Tuesday, the Washington-based bank said a severely negative response to the return of monetary policy to normal might lead to capital flows to emerging markets falling by up to 80% for several months. The bank said growth prospects were brighter this year than they had been in 2013 but the first co-ordinated expansion in five years in the west's \"big three\" economies \u2013 the US, Japan and euro region \u2013 had the potential to cause problems elsewhere in the global economy. Last December, the US Federal Reserve began to taper away the stimulus provided by its quantitative easing programme (an increase in the money supply caused by the purchase of bonds). The bank said that provided this adjustment happened in an orderly manner, there would be only a modest impact on developing countries. \"However, should the adjustment be disorderly, as it was in response to speculation about when a taper might begin during the spring and summer of 2013, interest rates could rise more quickly. \"In such a scenario, countries that have large current account deficits, large proportions of external debt and those that have had big credit expansions, would be among the most vulnerable.\" Andrew Burns, author of the Global Economic Prospects report, said: \"The strengthening recovery in high-income countries is very welcome, but it brings with it risks of disruption as monetary policy tightens.\" Burns said the bank had modelled the outcome if financial markets were unsettled by the process. He added that an increase in interest rates of one percentage point would lead to a 50% decline in capital flows, while a two percentage point fall would lead to an 80% drop, potentially \"provoking a crisis in some of the more vulnerable countries\". The bank is forecasting that global growth will pick up from 2.4% in 2013 to 3.2% this year, and to 3.4% in 2015. It believes much of the acceleration will be due to an improvement in economic conditions in high-income countries, where for the first time in five years all three of the main regions \u2013 the US, Europe and Japan \u2013 will be growing. Developing countries are expected to grow by 4.8% in 2014, slower than previously envisaged and 2.2 points down on the growth rates experienced in the half-decade before the financial crash of 2007. \"Almost all of the difference reflects a cooling off of the unsustainable turbo-charged pre-crisis growth, with very little due to an easing of growth potential in developing countries,\" the bank said. The Global Economic Prospects study pencils in expansion of 2.2% for advanced countries in 2014, up from 1.3% in 2013. \"Among high-income countries the recovery is most advanced in the US, with GDP growing for 10 quarters now. \"Growth in the euro area, after two years of contraction, is projected to be 1.1% this year, and 1.4% and 1.5% in 2015 and 2016 respectively.\" Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, said: \"Growth appears to be strengthening in both high-income and developing countries, but downside risks continue to threaten the global economic recovery. \"The performance of advanced countries is gaining momentum, and this should support stronger growth in developing countries in the months ahead. \"Still, to accelerate poverty reduction developing nations will need to adopt structural reforms that promote job creation, strengthen financial systems and shore up social safety nets.\"",
