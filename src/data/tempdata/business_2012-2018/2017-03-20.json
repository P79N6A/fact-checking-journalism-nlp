      "bodyText": "The current gas crisis is a prime example of how energy policy has been mishandled in this country. But it should not be an excuse for continuing the bad policy. Using talk of a gas shortage to increase fracking and coal seam gas exploration would be a bad solution to a problem of our own making. The latest statement by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) on the gas industry seems to makes it pretty clear that we are about to suffer a gas shortage. It notes at the top of its executive summary that \u201cdeclining gas production may result in insufficient gas to meet projected demand by GPG for supply of electricity from summer 2018-19\u201d. The statement includes estimates of which states will suffer shortages out to 2036: That would make it seem like a pretty open and shut case for needing to increase gas exploration and remove the moratorium on fracking that exists in Victoria and the Northern Territory. Surely a gas shortage means we need to increase the gas supply. But the shortage figures hide the fact that Australia is not suffering from a lack of gas at all. It\u2019s one of the more odd things that, while Aemo is predicting a gas shortage in 2019, Aemo also notes that demand for gas in Australia has actually fallen since 2012. It also seems weird to talk of a shortage of supply when we are also hearing about the massive boom in the gas industry in Queensland. And it is here that we get to the crux of the problem. We are producing more gas than ever before but it is not for Australian consumers, it is for exports: By 2020, 73% of gas production in Australia will head overseas. The problem is that when the Gladstone LNG plants and port opened, for the first time the eastern gas market was linked with the world market. At the time, the price of selling LNG to Japan was much higher than gas prices here, even accounting for the cost of conversion and transportation. It meant that the prices of gas in the south-eastern states rose but also that selling gas overseas became a more attractive option than selling it to domestic users. But since the Gladstone port and LNG plants came online, due to the massive increase in supply and demand not growing as fast as expected, the price has crashed and there is now a glut of LNG: And when the cost of coal seam gas turned out to be more than expected \u2013 due to, as Aemo notes, \u201cgeological challenges\u201d \u2013 it meant that in order to achieve a profit for these large and long-term export contracts for LNG, rather than use expensive gas, suppliers sought to use gas that previously went to domestic supply. It saw big export contracts that effectively sucked up as much of Australia\u2019s gas as possible. But, as Aemo notes, the lower prices in Japan have not led to lower prices here. In 2016 \u2013 coinciding with the first winter where LNG supply was in full swing \u2013 Aemo notes that spot prices increased from an average of around $5 a gigajoule (GJ) across gas markets in April 2016 to an average of $12/GJ in July 2016. None of this is a surprise. I first wrote of the looming gas price hike in March 2014 and about calls for a reservation of gas for local use in October that year. That three years later I could pretty much rewrite the same article says a bit about how energy policy in the country has been handled. The issue of cost and supply remains \u2013 although it is somewhat changed. Back in 2014 the view was that Japanese LNG prices would pull up our gas prices, so that we were in effect paying the world price. Except now we have the absurd case where Japan prices have fallen so low that there is talk of importing Australian LNG for domestic use. So do we need to unlock the gate \u2013 and allow fracking? Not particularly. We already have enough gas production to meet Australia\u2019s demands three times over and developing more fracking sites may not actually do much to lower prices. As Aemo notes: \u201cThe increased cost of sourcing new gas supply means additional gas in the market may not translate to lower prices.\u201d Arguing for new fracking exploration and production is effectively suggesting that the way to meet Australia\u2019s demand for gas and lower prices is to develop more costly sites and allow the low-cost production to be exported. That\u2019s a pretty odd policy to follow. Back in 2014, I was against moves to reserve gas supply because while doing so might guarantee electricity generation it is not a guarantee that prices will remain low. Western Australia has a gas reserve policy and, over the past 10 and 20 years, consumers in Perth have seen their gas prices increase faster than those living on the east coast: But my main issue against reserving gas for domestic use is doing so is a perverse incentive against the use of renewable energy. I was in 2014, however, perhaps rather too naive about how bad our energy policy would be handled and how strongly the government would be against renewable energy. Aemo argues that to remove all gas shortfalls from 2019 to 2024 all that is needed is to reserve \u201c5% of supply currently earmarked for LNG export\u201d. There is, however, some suggestion that the Aemo projections of shortage might be overstated. A report in 2015 by the Melbourne Energy Institute notes that Aemo has consistently overstated projections of demand for gas. Even since 2013 the amount of gas Aemo expects Australians to use has fallen: Better efficiency and consumers reducing use due to increased gas prices has seen gas demand fall by more than expected. Ironically, a gas reservation would likely reverse that trend and move consumers away from more energy efficient methods for heating and cooking. The issue of gas supply is not about a lack of gas in Australia but where that gas is going. A reserve of gas might now be a least worst policy but we certainly should not be using the current situation to move towards more costly \u2013 and environmentally dubious \u2013 methods of gas production.",

      "bodyText": "US authorities have secretly required airlines from eight nations to forbid passengers from carrying any electronic or electrical device larger than a cellphone. The new edict was distributed in an email described as \u201cconfidential\u201d from the US transportation safety administration (TSA) on Monday. The requirement forbids passengers from bringing laptops, iPads, Kindles and even cameras larger than mobile phones into the cabin. All such devices must be checked. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Saudia Airlines and Royal Jordanian airlines are among the affected countries; the full list had not been revealed to the affected airlines themselves until a press briefing by the US department of Homeland Security on Monday evening. The ban is techincally related to ten airports in eight countries: Queen Alia in Jordan Cairo International in Egypt Ataturk International in Turkey King Abudlaziz and King Khalid in Saudi Arabia Kuwait International in Kuwait, Mohammaed V in Morocco Doha International in Qatar Dubai international and Abu Dhabi international in the United Arab Emirates. The affected airlines are Royal Jordainia, Egyptair, Turkish airlines, Saudia airlines, Kuwait airways, Royal Air Morocco, Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad. The email \u2013 described as a \u201ccircular\u201d \u2013 is not a public regulation, but airlines will be expected to enforce the new rule. Airlines were issued the circular on Monday and given 96 hours to comply; the rules apply to flights both to and from the US, according to Royal Jordanian airlines. The circular does not address electronic flight bags (EFBs), which allow flight crews to display diagrams mapping flight patterns, maps of airports and other digital documentation, usually on an iPad. The lack of specificity leaves airlines in the dark as to whether their employees will be cited or otherwise punished for performing the vital functions of aircraft crew as usual. The TSA referred calls to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS would not confirm or deny existence of such a requirement: \u201cWe have no comment on potential security precautions, but will provide any update as appropriate,\u201d David Lapan, spokesperson for DHS, said in an emailed statement to the Guardian Monday morning. Lapan declined to comment further. By Monday afternoon, a US official had briefed Reuters that the ban followed a \u201cterrorism threat\u201d and was expected to be announced on Tuesday. The official said no American carriers are impacted by the ban, which is expected to be unveiled on Tuesday by the Homeland Security Department. Compliance has been swift: \u201cEffective March 21st, the carriage of electronic and electrical devices inbound to the USA shall only be inbound in checked baggage except for mobile and medical devices,\u201d according to a reservation agent at one of the affected airlines. Royal Jordanian tweeted a reference to the restrictions, referring cryptically to \u201cconcerned US departments\u201d. It was suggested that Royal Jordanian disobeyed the circular in part by making its existence known. The airline deleted the tweet on Monday afternoon after it had been up for several hours. In a tweet from its official account, Saudia also warned its customers that new security measures were introduced by the TSA, and would be enforced from Tuesday. This story was updated on 21 March 2017 based on further comment from the Department of Homeland Security.",

    "webTitle": "NHS trust triples injury payout to \u00a39.3m under controversial new rules", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The first case settled under controversial new compensation rules for serious injuries has seen an NHS trust forced to nearly triple its payout to a 10-year-old girl left with cerebral palsy from \u00a33.8m to \u00a39.3m. The case, involving East Lancashire Hospitals NHS trust, will send fresh shockwaves through the NHS and insurance companies, which have been braced for big increases in claims since the new \u201cOgden\u201d formula was announced last month. Despite intensive lobbying, the new rules came into force this week, and immediately resulted in a dramatic escalation in one payout. As recently as January, it was agreed that the 10-year-old would receive a lump sum capitalised at \u00a33.77m, but this will now be increased to \u00a39.29m. Her solicitor, Leonie Millard of Forbes Solicitors in Accrington, said: \u201cThe benefit for the claimant from the new -0.75% discount rate, is immense. It vastly improves the long-term future financial ability to meet her needs for the rest of her life, which is expected to be long. Her parents are comforted to know that there is funding to ensure that her needs are properly met when they are no longer around.\u201d Until now the Ogden formula for paying out compensation assumed that the claimant could earn 2.5% interest a year on a lump-sum payment. But under the new rules, the rate is assumed to be -0.75%. In documents published after the budget, it emerged the government\u2019s finances will take a near-\u00a36bn hit as a result of the increased bill faced by the NHS and other parts of the public sector as a result of the changes made to the way compensation awards will now be calculated. The Office for Budget Responsibility said the government would be setting aside an extra \u00a31.2bn a year to meet the expected costs to the public sector \u2013 and it would push up car insurance premiums by about 10%. The Association of British Insurers said it was \u201ccrazy\u201d that up to 36m insurance policies could be affected in what it alleged would be \u201cover-compensating\u201d a few thousand claimants a year. It is estimated that the cost of the average car insurance policy could increase by \u00a360 a year, but for younger and older drivers, the increase will be higher. Comparison site comparethemarket.com said the average price for drivers aged 17 to 20 will rise by \u00a3115 to \u00a31,650. The total increase in premiums paid by all motorists is expected to reach \u00a32bn. Direct Line, one of Britain\u2019s biggest insurers, has already blamed a \u00a3217m slump in profits on the new Ogden rate, as it pencilled in bills for some individual cases doubling from \u00a310m to \u00a320m. The lord chancellor, Liz Truss, has said there will be consultation on the new rules, but the insurance industry says it has yet to be told the shape of any reforms that might be forthcoming. The ABI said: \u201cThe first wave of impacts on insurance costs are already being felt. A number of insurers have already publicly confirmed that premiums are going up as a result of the decision in February to cut the discount rate.\u201d Huw Evans, director general of the ABI, said: \u201cThe massive rise in insurers\u2019 claims costs, which makes premium rises for millions of customers inevitable, results from a wholly avoidable decision by the lord chancellor. It was based on pressure from claimant lawyers, poor legal advice and an outdated formula that does not reflect the choices available today for a prudent claimant. With the public purse hit by \u00a36bn, the government consultation cannot come soon enough.\u201d But Michael Redfern, the QC who was counsel for the 10-year-old girl, known only as \u201cLMS\u201d, said: \u201cThe large increase in lump-sum awards is offset by lack of return on lump-sum low-risk investment and the ability to keep pace with inflation. \u201cWe welcome the new discount rate, the first change in 17 years, which addresses the actual lack of meaningful return on safe lump-sum investment opportunities. The only person to benefit from the new discount rate is the claimant. It has no impact on legal costs.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The first rule of making an apology is simple: be clear about what you are apologising for. Matt Brittin, head of Google\u2019s operations in Europe, failed the test. Was Google taking responsibility for allowing the company\u2019s YouTube site to be polluted with extremist videos produced by terror preachers and racists? Or was he merely apologising to advertisers for the fact that some of their messages appeared alongside such offensive material? Brittin blurred the lines during his remarks on Monday but one suspects the advertisers were uppermost in his mind for three reasons. First, a boycott has been growing by the day and Google will be desperate to avoid more corporate defections. Second, most of his points were about tightening the definition of sites deemed suitable for adverts. Third, Brittin refused several times to say whether Google would take the initiative and try to root out altogether offensive content on YouTube. Ambiguity on the third point is astonishing. As Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs select committee, put it in a letter to the company last week: \u201cIt is inexplicable to us that Google can move very fast to remove material from YouTube when it is found to be copyrighted, but that the same prompt action is not taken when the material involves proscribed organisations and hateful and illegal content.\u201d Why won\u2019t Google commit clearly to being prompt and proactive? Brittin\u2019s argument, as far one can tell, is that it\u2019s difficult to police content instantly when 400 hours of video are being uploaded to YouTube every minute. But that is feeble. If Google was serious about tackling the problem it would allocate more resources, which it can afford to do, and stop relying so heavily on viewers to spot and report offensive material. Brittin promised Google would be \u201clooking again at how we improve what we\u2019re doing on enforcement\u201d with details to follow. Here\u2019s what a responsible organisation would do. Accept that it made a grave mistake in allowing hate material to be distributed. Explain what went wrong. Promise it won\u2019t happen again. Describe how the new practices will succeed where the current ones failed. Offer refunds to those companies and government departments whose adverts were placed alongside offensive videos produced by the likes of a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Until those commitments are made, it is hard to understand why the irate advertisers would wish to risk a return to YouTube. As currently described, the place looks like the wild west with the sheriff admitting he\u2019s lost control. Vodafone\u2019s Indian plan makes sense, but will it call the shots? Amid chief executive Vittorio Colao\u2019s uplifting talk about creating \u201ca new champion of Digital India\u201d, it\u2019s easy to forget that Vodafone is merging its Indian business with Idea Cellular only as a plan B. The original script imagined a lovely go-it-alone life in the world\u2019s most exciting emerging market for telecoms. Instead, Vodafone got enmeshed in a damaging price war, took a \u20ac6.3bn (\u00a35.4bn) impairment hit and has had to think again. As a plan B, the Idea deal looks a sensible way to counter the price-slashing tactics of well-funded newcomer Reliance Jio. The merged Vodafone/Idea entity will be the market leader with almost 400 million customers. There is scope to cut costs and both principal shareholders expect the new business to be self-funding. If so, Vodafone shareholders can stop worrying so fretfully about the safety of the overall group dividend. Yet there\u2019s one oddity to the new arrangement. Vodafone, despite being the biggest shareholder with a 45% stake one day one, won\u2019t get to pick the chairman. Instead, he will be Kumar Mangalam Birla of Aditya Birla Group, whose holding in Idea converts to 26% after a top-up arrangement. Vodafone gets to choose the finance director while the chief executive will be selected jointly. An Indian tycoon at the top of an Indian telcoms giant makes pragmatic sense. All the same, Vodafone is accepting fewer boardroom rights than its economic interest would usually imply. If all runs smoothly and two sides\u2019 interests remain aligned, it doesn\u2019t matter. But Vodafone\u2019s experience in India suggests unwelcome events happen. Standard Life and Aberdeen: cut from a different cloth Can Keith Skeoch and Martin Gilbert make their joint chief executive gig work at the merged Standard Life and Aberdeen? Clarifying statements were issued on Monday, but added to the confusion on one point. Skeoch was described as being accountable for \u201cthe day to day running of the fabric of the combined business\u201d. The fabric? Is running the fabric different from running the company?

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The cost of assembling a car in Britain could increase by \u00a32,370 in the event of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, forcing some manufacturers to look at moving production out of the country, a report has found. The increase in costs \u2013 equivalent to more than 10% per vehicle \u2013 would hit the average UK-built car if Britain falls back on World Trade Organisation rules after leaving the European Union. Even if the UK agrees a tariff of 5% with the EU on importing and exporting cars and 2.5% on components then \u00a31,202 will be added to the cost of production. The costs have been calculated by PA Consulting Group as part of research into the impact of Brexit on the automotive industry. The report warns that it would make economic sense for some manufacturers to abandon British factories if 10% WTO tariffs are introduced. The cost of exporting 200,000 cars a year from the UK would be \u00a3920m after two years, which PA Consulting said would \u201ceasily\u201d cover the cost of building a new plant in the EU. However, in contrast, car manufacturers with no British operations at present could look to move some production to the country to avoid the costs of tariffs. Tim Lawrence, global head of manufacturing at PA Consulting, said there could be \u201cupsides and downsides\u201d for the UK if it leaves the single market and customs union. \u201cThe key point that has come out of it [the report] for me is the potential impact if we don\u2019t come up with a trade deal and we don\u2019t come up with a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all depends on the outcome of trade negotiations that will start in the next week or two.\u201d Toyota last week announced it was investing \u00a3240m into upgrading its car plant in Derbyshire while Nissan has committed to expanding its Sunderland factory, the biggest in the UK. However, the European boss of Toyota warned tariff-free access to Europe was vital to the future success of the Burnaston plant and concerns are growing about other factories. There are fears that General Motors\u2019 Vauxhall plants at Ellesmere Port, Merseyside, and Luton, Bedfordshire, could be downsized or even closed after the business was bought by Peugeot. BMW has also warned it could make the new electric Mini in Germany rather than its factory in Oxford. Bosses in the automotive industry have consistently warned the government that leaving the single market and the customs union could have a damaging impact on UK plants because of the number of cars that are exported and the high proportion of car parts that are imported. On average just 41% of the parts in a car assembled in the UK are made in the country, while some factories, including Toyota\u2019s, export as many 80% of their vehicles to the EU. Each car is made up of thousands of components. Some of these components cross the English Channel three, four or even five times during production. The PA Consulting report identifies three possible scenarios for carmakers and car parts makers if trade restrictions, even partial ones, are enforced. It says that manufacturers with substantial operations in the UK and with good market exposure in Britain \u2013 such as Jaguar Land Rover \u2013 are likely to encourage suppliers to open new sites or expand in the UK. \u201cThis would involve increased investment in UK parts procurement, production and supply chains to offset increased import costs, aiming to reduce the impact of tariffs imposed on component parts moving between the UK and EU,\u201d the report said. However, companies with substantial operations in Europe or overseas which use their UK factories as a satellite factory that focuses on exports to the EU could relocate. The final scenario is that EU-based manufacturers who export vehicles or components to the UK \u2013 such as Ford \u2013 could move some manufacturing to the UK. This would depend on \u201cimport volumes and costs of supply\u201d, PA Consulting found, adding: \u201cIt is likely that in this scenario, the price of imported cars will increase for UK customers, with increased prices covering the costs of any tariffs.\u201d Lawrence added: \u201cBoth the EU and the UK would benefit from keeping free trade and supply chains unaffected because any tariffs would be damaging for both sides based on today\u2019s complex supply chain arrangements. \u201cCarmakers will have to review their manufacturing and supply chain network and investment decisions and plan for scenarios based on extra tariffs and charges/incentives on corporation tax. \u201cSome may consider investment options into the UK, but equally some may consider investing into the EU.\u201d",

One customer, Andy Fidler, told the Guardian he was presented with the data usage and full call and text history of another named customer when he logged in on Sunday night.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pound is off the worst levels it reached in the immediate aftermath of the news that Article 50 will be triggered on 29 March, but is still marginally down on the day after a bright start. It is currently down 0.06% at $1.2385 having fallen as low as $1.2368, and initially risen as high as $1.2435 on growing suggestions a UK rate rise could come sooner than expected. Against the euro the pound is 0.19% lower at \u20ac1.1518. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is virtually flat, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.19% and France\u2019s Cac has slipped 0.11%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Stock markets, particularly in the US, have been buoyed by hopes that Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tax and spending plans will boost the economy. But if long term stable economic growth does not emerge, markets may fall back sharply again and confidence become severely dented, according to Mohamed A El-Erian,chief economic adviser at Allianz. Read more here: And here\u2019s an interesting view of the eurogroup meeting about Greece from the Slovakian finance minister: In Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has told a visiting delegation of tourism officials that he is confident an ongoing bailout review will be wrapped up imminently. Helena Smith reports: The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has used a meeting with the country\u2019s tourism chief, Andreas Andreadis, to express his conviction that despite being delayed, talks with creditors will be completed soon. \u201cHe is very optimistic the review will be concluded,\u201d Andreadis said emerging from the meeting. Labour reforms appears to be the major sticking point, according to insiders who say technical teams are not in a position to resolve what is \u201can enormously complex\u201d issue. Although agreement on \u20ac3.6bn worth of extra fiscal measures has been reached, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos insists that \u201cnothing will be agreed until everything is agreed.\u201d Today\u2019s euro group had originally be set as the deadline for the review to be concluded by Tsipras who told Andreadis that he expected tourism to play an important role in improving GDP this year. It was not impossible, he said, that Greece would attract 30 million tourists in 2017 - an all time record. Government sources are saying they expect the review to be concluded at the next eurogroup on April 7. With the decline in the oil price and uncertainty after the protectionist stance on trade by the US at the weekend\u2019 G20 meeting, Wall Street has made an uncertain start to the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 15 points or 0.07% while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both opened a couple of points lower. The pound\u2019s slip since the confirmation that Brexit will be triggered next week does not mean the currency will remain weak, although there are other risks to watch out for, reckons Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index. She said: The pound fell to session lows in the hour after the news, but the question now is, how much further can [it] fall, and is all of the \u201cbad\u201d Brexit news priced in? In fairness, we think that today\u2019s dip in the pound is just a knee-jerk reaction to the Article 50 news, and part of sterling\u2019s decline is also due to the recovery in the dollar and US Treasury yields, 10-year yields are back above 2.5%. But it is worth watching how the pound performs in the next day or two, if [it] can find support ahead of 1.2350 \u2013 a key short-term support level- and recoup today\u2019s losses then it would be a bullish signal for the pound for this reason: the pound is failing to react to \u201cbad news\u201d. Last week the pound actually rallied although the Scottish leader said she will hold a second independence referendum, this is significant as markets that don\u2019t fall on what is perceived as bad news can often rally in the aftermath. The other reason to be positive on the pound is the recovery in the UK-US yield spread, which had fallen to a record low at one point last week. This spread has narrowed by 13 basis points since last week\u2019s BOE meeting. This may not sound like a lot, but in the bond market this move is a big deal, and, if it continues to recover, could trigger a further recovery in the pound... This does not mean that the pound is not without risks, it is just that the Brexit negotiations, at least in the short-term, is not one of them. There are a couple of risks for sterling that are worth noting; firstly, retail sales data on Thursday. UK inflation is expected to rise to 2.2% on Tuesday, if rising prices is hurting the consumer, then we could see the pound take a knock. The second risk to sterling is the EU negotiating team\u2019s response to Article 50, which we should know by end of April at the latest. This will be crucial to set the tone for exit negotiations and trade deals with the currency bloc... It is also worth noting that there are risks for other currencies this week too, including the first French Presidential debate tonight, if Far Right candidate Le Pen puts in a strong performance then this could knock the euro. The dollar could also suffer this week from political risk. The US FBI director is scheduled to testify to the US Congress on the extent of Russia\u2019s involvement with the US election; if there is any link that Trump colluded with the Russians to weaken Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign then his political position will become tenuous and could knock the dollar. This is worth watching later on Monday. More signs of growth in the US economy, from the Chicago Federal Reserve: Chicago Fed president Charles Evans has told Fox Business TV that the economy is on a positive course, and that three interest rate rises this year are entirely possible. And to Bloomberg he has said something even stronger: Commenting on the reverse in the pound, Craig Erlam - senior market analyst at Oanda, said: The pound has come under a little bit of pressure after a spokesman for Theresa May revealed that the UK PM will trigger article 50 on 29 March. While the timing of the triggering of article 50 comes as no surprise given that May had previously vowed to do so before the end of March, it does show that sterling remains sensitive to Brexit related headlines, even those that are already widely known. While the drop off in the pound isn\u2019t too severe, it was enough to take it into negative territory for the day. It also acts as a reminder that the next two years will likely continue to be volatile for the UK currency as well as the FTSE and UK Gilts, with traders still concerned about the road the country is on. Well, it took a little while but the pound has now fallen back following the news that Article 50 will be triggered on 29 March, and is now down 0.05% at $1.2386. Part of the reason for the strength of the pound is the dollar\u2019s weakness in the wake of the G20 meeting at the weekend which confirmed the US government\u2019s protectionist stance on trade. But there are also growing suggestions of a sooner than expected UK interest rate rise. According to analysts at MNI, the chances of a rate rise later this year have nearly doubled since the Bank of England revealed last week that one member voted for a hike this time round. MNI said: [The] market is now pricing in a 44% chance of a 25bp rate hike in Nov 2017, up from 25% last Monday as Kristen Forbes calls for a 25bp rate hike due to rising inflation and better growth, while there was some hawkish undertones from some other members in the MPC minutes as well. News that the UK will trigger Article 50 and start the Brexit process in earnest on Wednesday 29 March has had little impact on the pound so far. Sterling has been drifting off its day\u2019s peak as the morning wore on but is still at three week high against the dollar at $1.2412, up 0.15%. It remains virtually flat against the euro. Oil prices are on the slide as signs of increased US production outweighed the recent agreed cuts from Opec. The oil group has acted to try and deal with a continuing supply glut, but on Friday it emerged that US drillers had added more rigs last week, taking the total of active rigs to 631, the highest since September 2015. On top of that, the US protectionist stance as evidenced from the weekend\u2019s G20 meeting has raised concerns about the outlook for the global economy, and therefore the demand for oil. So Brent crude is currently down 1% at $51.23 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate has fallen 1.39% to $48.10. With an uncertain mood around the markets - Brexit, Greece, the US protectionism which led to the G20 removing a free trade pledge from its weekend communique - investors are looking for havens, and gold is benefiting. Gold has hit a two week high and is currently up $3 an ounce at $1232, as the dollar continues to weaken. David Morrison, senior market strategist at SpreadCo, said: Gold and silver continue to build on gains made from last week. Both metals flew higher following Wednesday\u2019s Fed meeting. The FOMC\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections was viewed as less hawkish than expected, being effectively unchanged from December. The consensus expectation was that the Fed would indicate it was prepared to hike rates by 100 basis points in 2017, up from the 75 indicated at the end of last year. Good news for Irish banks, which were hit hard during the financial crisis. Ratings agency S&amp;P said the sector\u2019s recent results showed \u201c their credit profile has largely recovered from the severe ruptures experienced during 2008-2011.\u201d It said: We now believe that the robustness of the banks\u2019 capital and liquidity profiles is both satisfactory and resilient. Furthermore, excluding a large negative exceptional item in relation to deleveraging costs in one case, all six rated banks are profitable for the first time since 2007. Earlier this year, S&amp;P raised their rating on Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland: In both cases the outlook on the long-term rating is stable, which is consistent with the stable trend that we see for Irish banking economic and industry risk. Looking ahead to Tuesday\u2019s UK inflation figures, and the rising cost of living puts more pressure on real wage growth. Jack Coy, an economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: On Tuesday, ONS data are expected to show that Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation increased to 2.1% in February, a fourth consecutive monthly rise. With upward pressure from the weak pound and higher global oil prices than a year ago, inflation is showing no signs of plateauing. Such a rise would bring inflation just below nominal wage growth. Real wages are now growing negligibly and may begin to shrink in the coming months. Vodafone has agreed a long awaited move to merge its Indian operations with those of Idea Cellular. The move will create the country\u2019s biggest telecoms operator, and comes after new entrant Reliance sparked increased competition and a price war. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Vodafone\u2019s decision to combine its Indian unit with Idea will create the largest mobile operator in India, with around 400 million customers. That makes it four times the size of Reliance Jio, the challenger operator that has upset rivals by offering free data for the last six months. A sensible move by Vodafone as it just doesn\u2019t have the appetite to fight a long and bitter price war on its own... With (de)consolidation in India sorted, what now for Vodafone? Talk of a merger with US group Liberty Global has been doing the rounds for a while in the City and Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao recently said the merits of such a tie-up remain undimmed. Given the appetite for deals at the moment, and the depressed value of sterling post-Brexit, there is a chance Vodafone and Liberty could jump into bed together. Shares are virtually unmoved on the announcement, rising just a shade as it expected and as investors wait for what\u2019s expected to be a fairly downbeat set of annual results in May. In February the firm said full-year earnings are expected to come in towards the bottom of range after lacklustre performances in the UK and India.\u201d The eurogroup is discussing Greece once more later today but little progress is expected. Analysts at UniCredit said: Finance ministers will discuss the implementation of euro-area member states\u2019 draft budgetary plans for 2017, the budgetary situation in the euro area as a whole and developments regarding the second review of Greece\u2019s macroeconomic adjustment program. Greece and its lenders are heading to the meeting with few expectations of a breakthrough and the best-case scenario for Athens being an agreement for the institutions and their mission chiefs to shortly return to the Greek capital and resume negotiations. Meanwhile eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem was reported over the weekend as saying he wanted to stay in his post despite the prospect of him losing his job as Dutch finance minister following the recent election result. Confounding expectations, the FTSE 100 is on the back foot in early trading, undermined by the stronger pound which dents the prospects for the dollar earners which form a major part of the index. Having hit a new closing high on Friday, the FTSE 100 is currently down 0.25%. Unilever has slipped 3p to \u00a340.37 following weekend talk it could put its spreads business up for sale. Meanwhile Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped 0.31% and France\u2019s Cac is 0.36% lower. Sentiment has not been helped by the continued protectionist tone of the new US administration, which led to the G20 dropping a commitment to free trade at the weekend. The uncertainty over the outlook for trade also helped weaken the dollar Earlier German producer prices showed their biggest year on year rise since December 2011. They climbed by 3.1% in February but this was slightly less than the expected rise of 3.2%. The month on month figure was 0.2%, again a little lower than the forecast 0.3%. European markets are set for a mixed open: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Despite the continuing uncertainty about the outcome of Brexit negotiations, the pound is holding firm in early trading, as prime minister Theresa May begins her nationwide tour to \u201cunite the country\u201d. Sterling is up 0.27% against the dollar at $1.2427 and virtually unchanged against the euro at \u20ac1.1531. Recent hawkish comments from the Bank of England and the prospect of UK inflation hitting 2.1% when the latest data is unveiled on Tuesday are supporting the pound. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: The Bank of England hawks could send the pound above the 100-day moving average (1.2408) against the US dollar. The UK\u2019s inflation data is due on Tuesday and could restate the rising inflationary pressures in the UK. The consensus for the headline inflation is 2.1% year-on-year versus 1.8% printed a month earlier. The core inflation may have climbed to 1.7% year-on-year from 1.6% a month earlier. After the MPC delivered an unexpectedly hawkish stance at last week\u2019s monetary policy meeting, a solid inflation read could easily boost the BoE hawks, encourage a further appreciation in the pound across the board and dent the appetite in the FTSE. FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed said: Sterling is still holding tight, thanks to the Fed neutral hike and BoE\u2019s Kristin Forbes who voted for a rate hike. With inflation on the rise some MPC members believe that a rate hike would be needed sooner than later, but how many MPC members will join Ms. Forbes remains uncertain. Brexit headlines will become the major force moving the pound the days ahead, and the harsher stance EU takes the more pressure might be felt. Elsewhere, on a fairly quiet Monday morning for corporate news, investors will be watching Unilever shares after reports that it could put some of its businesses up for sale following the failed Kraft bid. And the Uber president Jeff Jones has quit in the latest problem for the troubled firm. We\u2019ll also be watching for any fallout from the weekend\u2019s G20 meeting, which dropped a global free trade pledge after opposition from the US administration.",

She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound fell to session lows in the hour after the news, but the question now is, how much further can [it] fall, and is all of the \u201cbad\u201d Brexit news priced in?</p> <p>In fairness, we think that today\u2019s dip in the pound is just a knee-jerk reaction to the Article 50 news, and part of sterling\u2019s decline is also due to the recovery in the dollar and US Treasury yields, 10-year yields are back above 2.5%. But it is worth watching how the pound performs in the next day or two, if [it] can find support ahead of 1.2350 \u2013 a key short-term support level- and recoup today\u2019s losses then it would be a bullish signal for the pound for this reason: the pound is failing to react to \u201cbad news\u201d. Last week the pound actually rallied although the Scottish leader said she will hold a second independence referendum, this is significant as markets that don\u2019t fall on what is perceived as bad news can often rally in the aftermath.</p> <p>The other reason to be positive on the pound is the recovery in the UK-US yield spread, which had fallen to a record low at one point last week. This spread has narrowed by 13 basis points since last week\u2019s BOE meeting. This may not sound like a lot, but in the bond market this move is a big deal, and, if it continues to recover, could trigger a further recovery in the pound...</p> <p>This does not mean that the pound is not without risks, it is just that the Brexit negotiations, at least in the short-term, is not one of them. There are a couple of risks for sterling that are worth noting; firstly, retail sales data on Thursday. UK inflation is expected to rise to 2.2% on Tuesday, if rising prices is hurting the consumer, then we could see the pound take a knock.</p> <p>The second risk to sterling is the EU negotiating team\u2019s response to Article 50, which we should know by end of April at the latest. This will be crucial to set the tone for exit negotiations and trade deals with the currency bloc...</p> <p> It is also worth noting that there are risks for other currencies this week too, including the first French Presidential debate tonight, if Far Right candidate Le Pen puts in a strong performance then this could knock the euro. The dollar could also suffer this week from political risk. The US FBI director is scheduled to testify to the US Congress on the extent of Russia\u2019s involvement with the US election; if there is any link that Trump colluded with the Russians to weaken Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign then his political position will become tenuous and could knock the dollar. This is worth watching later on Monday.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58cfcd05e4b0a411e9ab6a1a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-20T12:39:38.608Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More signs of growth in the US economy, from the Chicago Federal Reserve:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/843802075138002944\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"sl\" dir=\"ltr\">Chicago Fed Nat Activity Index Feb: 0.34 (est 0.03; prev -0.05; rev prev -0.02)</p>&mdash; LiveSquawk (@LiveSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/843802075138002944\">March 20, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Chicago Fed president Charles Evans has told Fox Business TV that the economy is on a positive course, and that three interest rate rises this year are entirely possible.

Recent hawkish comments from the Bank of England and the prospect of UK inflation hitting 2.1% when the latest data is unveiled on Tuesday are supporting the pound. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, <strong>s</strong>enior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Bank of England hawks could send the pound above the 100-day moving average (1.2408) against the US dollar. The UK\u2019s inflation data is due on Tuesday and could restate the rising inflationary pressures in the UK. The consensus for the headline inflation is 2.1% year-on-year versus 1.8% printed a month earlier. The core inflation may have climbed to 1.7% year-on-year from 1.6% a month earlier. After the MPC delivered an unexpectedly hawkish stance at last week\u2019s monetary policy meeting, a solid inflation read could easily boost the BoE hawks, encourage a further appreciation in the pound across the board and dent the appetite in the FTSE.</p> </blockquote> <p>FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sterling is still holding tight, thanks to the Fed neutral hike and BoE\u2019s Kristin Forbes who voted for a rate hike. With inflation on the rise some MPC members believe that a rate hike would be needed sooner than later, but how many MPC members will join Ms. Forbes remains uncertain. Brexit headlines will become the major force moving the pound the days ahead, and the harsher stance EU takes the more pressure might be felt.</p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere, on a fairly quiet Monday morning for corporate news, investors will be watching Unilever shares after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/19/unilever-bid-rejection-shareholders-garage-sale-warning\">reports that it could put some of its businesses up for sale following the failed Kraft bid</a>.</p> <p>And the Uber president Jeff Jones<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/19/uber-faces-further-turmoil-as-company-president-jeff-jones-quits\"> has quit</a> in the latest problem for the troubled firm.</p> <p>We\u2019ll also be watching for any fallout from the weekend\u2019s G20 meeting, which dropped a global free trade pledge after opposition from the US administration.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-20T07:59:43.031Z\">at 7.59am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

The Brexit vote has weakened the pound which, in turn, is pushing prices up as the cost of imports rise. Earlier this month, we learned that supermarket inflation doubled in February as shoppers had to pay more for basics such as butter and tea. This is all likely to hit the headlines again this week with interim results from Finsbury Food Group, maker of those Frozen, Paw Patrol and Ghostbusters cakes you never really want to buy, but are forced to after making a complete Horlicks of baking your child\u2019s birthday sponge. Finsbury has already riffed on rising costs, which give the food industry three options: take a hit to margins, cut your own costs, or pass on the price rise to supermarkets. The last of these choices leaves retailers with a similar decision and increases the risk of price hikes being borne by the consumer. The added problem with all that is, if too many retail prices go up, there\u2019s either a fall in living standards or a rise in pay claims and then (potentially) an inflationary spiral. None of which is ideal, but we may have to be prepared to put up with it. A bit like buying a branded birthday cake. A banker and her boss walk into a bar \u2026 If you don\u2019t think financiers tell gags, please visit the website of the Banking Standards Board. There you will find boss Alison Cottrell regaling readers on ethics, as part of a series trailing a BSB event on that subject due to take place this week. It includes a very decent crack by Richard Breeden, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who said: \u201cIt is not an adequate ethical standard to aspire to get through the day without being indicted\u201d. There is added humour in imagining Wall Street eyebrows arching. Cottrell continues: \u201c[Having high standards] needs employees who are able and ready to exercise professional judgment, processes that align recognition and reward with the firm\u2019s espoused values, and a culture in which mistakes are remedied and learned from, rather than ignored or associated with blame.\u201d And what is the venue for the BSB event? The Bank of England, where last week Charlotte Hogg resigned as deputy governor over a compliance failure \u2013 despite being just a fortnight into the job and being backed by her boss. Who says these folk don\u2019t have a sense of humour? FCA rule takes shine off spread betting\u2019s future When it was founded by Stuart Wheeler in the 1970s, the Investors Gold Index allowed punters to bet on the price of gold bullion at a time when you could get banged up for buying the real thing. That clever idea grew into what we now know as spread-betting giant IG Group, and it made Wheeler so rich that he could afford restoration attempts on crumbling relics such as Kent\u2019s Chilham Castle (2002) and the Conservative party (2001). Wheeler is no longer involved with IG, which, as we may hear at its trading statement this week, is lucky for him. The company\u2019s 40 years of seemingly unbroken success now appears to have stalled. For starters, folk have finally started to notice what has always been financial spread betting\u2019s dirty little secret \u2013 namely that only 20% of users actually make any money from products pitched as investments. This has become such a problem that even the Financial Conduct Authority has noticed and, in December, the regulator announced a clampdown to protect inexperienced retail customers, which knocked \u00a31bn off the value of listed spread betting firms. The industry\u2019s reaction to that devastating move? Supine acceptance, which rather suggests it knew what it had been getting away with for years.",

The last of these choices leaves retailers with a similar decision and increases the risk of price hikes being borne by the consumer.</p> <p>The added problem with all that is, if too many retail prices go up, there\u2019s either a fall in living standards or a rise in pay claims and then (potentially) an inflationary spiral. None of which is ideal, but we may have to be prepared to put up with it. A bit like buying a branded birthday cake.</p> <h2><strong>A banker and her boss walk into a bar \u2026</strong></h2> <p>If you don\u2019t think financiers tell gags, please visit the website of the Banking Standards Board. There you will find boss Alison Cottrell regaling readers on ethics, as part of a series trailing a BSB event on that subject due to take place this week. It includes a very decent crack by Richard Breeden, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who said: \u201cIt is not an adequate ethical standard to aspire to get through the day without being indicted\u201d. There is added humour in imagining Wall Street eyebrows arching.</p> <p>Cottrell continues: \u201c[Having high standards] needs employees who are able and ready to exercise professional judgment, processes that align recognition and reward with the firm\u2019s espoused values, and a culture in which mistakes are remedied and learned from, rather than ignored or associated with blame.\u201d</p> <p>And what is the venue for the BSB event? The Bank of England, where last week Charlotte Hogg resigned as deputy governor over a compliance failure \u2013 despite being just a fortnight into the job and being backed by her boss. Who says these folk don\u2019t have a sense of humour?</p> <h2><strong>FCA rule takes shine off spread betting\u2019s future</strong></h2> <p>When it was founded by Stuart Wheeler in the 1970s, the Investors Gold Index allowed punters to bet on the price of gold bullion at a time when you could get banged up for buying the real thing. That clever idea grew into what we now know as spread-betting giant IG Group, and it made Wheeler so rich that he could afford restoration attempts on crumbling relics such as Kent\u2019s Chilham Castle (2002) and the Conservative party (2001).</p> <p>Wheeler is no longer involved with IG, which, as we may hear at its trading statement this week, is lucky for him. The company\u2019s 40 years of seemingly unbroken success now appears to have stalled.</p> <p>For starters, folk have finally started to notice what has always been financial spread betting\u2019s dirty little secret \u2013 namely that only 20% of users actually make any money from products pitched as investments.</p> <p>This has become such a problem that even the Financial Conduct Authority has noticed and, in December, the regulator announced a clampdown to protect inexperienced retail customers, which knocked \u00a31bn off the value of listed spread betting firms.</p> <p>The industry\u2019s reaction to that devastating move? Supine acceptance, which rather suggests it knew what it had been getting away with for years.</p>",

      "bodyText": "US president Donald Trump\u2019s fortune has fallen by about $1bn to $3.5bn over the past year, as measured by Forbes magazine in its annual list of the world\u2019s billionaires. However, overall it has been a good 12 months for the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals, with a record 233 moving into the billionaire bracket, taking the global number of people with nine-zero fortunes to 2,043 \u2013 the most in the 31-year history of the list. The billionaires in Forbes\u2019 list are worth a combined $7.67tn (\u00a36.18tn) \u2013 more than three times the UK\u2019s annual gross domestic product (GDP). Kerry Dolan, co-editor of the Forbes billionaires list, published on Monday, said the gains are mostly the result of booming stock markets and the rising price of oil over the past 12 months. Global markets have hit record highs due to the so-called \u201cTrump bump\u201d following Trump\u2019s election, with the Dow Jones soaring above 20,000 points for the first time and the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 closing at a record 7,415 points last week. The fall in Trump\u2019s net worth is due to a drop in the value of office space in Midtown Manhattan, where the president owns about 10 buildings. Forbes said Trump had fallen from the world\u2019s 324th-richest person to 544th. \u201cForty percent of Donald Trump\u2019s fortune is tied up in Trump Tower and eight buildings within one mile of it,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cLately, the neighbourhood has been struggling (relatively speaking).\u201d Trump has refused to publish his tax returns to show the true scale of his wealth, but during the campaign he claimed he was worth \u201cin excess of $10bn\u201d. Dolan said that in previous years the real estate tycoon had challenged Forbes for underestimating his fortune. \u201cWe contact everyone we can to give them the opportunity for feedback. Over the last 31 years we have been compiling this list Trump has given us a lot of feedback, believe me, \u2018You guys are too low I am worth far more than you say\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t call back to dispute our estimate. I would hope that running the country is more important to him right now than Forbes\u2019s value of his net worth.\u201d The richest person in the world remains Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who saw his fortune grow by $11bn to $86bn. He is followed by investor Warren Buffett, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who was this year\u2019s biggest gainer with a $27.6bn increase in his fortune to $72.8bn. The US accounts for the biggest population of billionaires with 565, up 25 on last year. But China is catching up with 319 billionaires, and a further 68 if Hong Kong and Macau are included. Germany is third with 114 billionaires. The number of UK billionaires increased from 50 to 54, with new entrants including Philip Day, the man behind Edinburgh Woollen Mill, and Simon Nixon, the co-founder of moneysupermarket.com. The richest people in the UK are the Hinduja family, who control a conglomerate of businesses including cars and banks and are worth $15.4bn. Property and internet investors David and Simon Reuben come second with a $15.3bn fortune. The third richest, and among the biggest gainer, is Jim Ratcliffe the founder and chairman of chemicals group Ineos. Among the biggest British losers is Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley whose fortune dropped by 25% to $2.6bn. His wealth, which is largely held in Sports Direct shares, has roughly halved over the past two years as shares collapsed following the Guardian expos\u00e9 of \u201cVictorian workhouse\u201d-style conditions in its distribution warehouses. Sir Philip Green and his wife, Tina, the owners of Arcadia, which owns Topshop and once owned BHS, also lost just over $1bn, with their fortune slumping to $4.8bn. They fell more than 100 places to 339th. Oxfam said the creation of so many new billionaires in one year was a sign of \u201ceconomic sickness rather than health\u201d. \u201cOur warped economic model leads to more unequal societies that trap millions of people in poverty - it allows an elite group to accrue extreme wealth while one in nine people go to bed hungry every night,\u201d Max Lawson, Oxfam\u2019s head of inequality policy, said. \u201cWe need to build a more human economy where the super-rich pay their fair share of tax, workers earn a living wage, and governments invest in decent healthcare and education to give everyone a good start in life.\u201d The number of women on the list increased to 227, from 202 in 2016. A record 56 of the women are self-made billionaires \u2013 the highest ever. All but one of the 15 newly self-made female billionaires came from the Asia-Pacfic region, including Vietnam\u2019s first self-made female billionaire Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao who took her budget airline VietJet Air public last month. Yoshiko Shinohara, who started her temp agency in her one-bedroom Tokyo apartment, became Japan\u2019s first self-made female billionaire. She enters the list due to a 50% surge in the stock price of her company Temp Holdings, which is designed to get more women into the workforce. The richest woman on the list is France\u2019s Liliane Bettencourt, who inherited a stake in L\u2019Oreal from her father. She\u2019s worth $39.5bn. There are just 10 black people on the list, a drop of two from last year. The richest black person is Nigerian cement tycoon Aliko Dangote with an estimated fortune of $12.2bn. There are only three black women on the list, including Oprah Winfrey who has a $3bn fortune.",

    "webTitle": "Thousands join UK legal case against VW over emissions scandal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than 35,000 motorists have joined a class action lawsuit against VW in England and Wales over the emissions scandal. The size of the group is increasing at the rate of 500 drivers a day and lawyers are confident the legal action will eventually involve about 100,000 owners of VW, Audi, Skoda and Seat cars. Damon Parker, of the law firm Harcus Sinclair, said the action began with a small number of individuals coming forward. \u201cThey came to us with concerns that they had bought these cars which they thought were of a certain quality, which they thought were less harmful to the environment. \u201cThey said they would never have bought them if they had known they were not of satisfactory quality. From a few people coming to us it has just grown. We set up a call centre in our basement and employed 20 extra people to take calls.\u201d The action is seeking compensation from VW for selling cars that the lawyers argue were not road worthy because the emissions were far higher than they purported to be. This month, the carmaker pleaded guilty to all criminal charges in the US, admitting to a scheme to sidestep pollution rules on nearly 600,000 vehicles. VW admitted conspiracy and obstruction of justice in the scheme, which used software called a \u201cdefeat device\u201d to suppress emissions of nitrogen oxide during tests. The firm has agreed to pay $4.3bn (\u00a33.5bn) in civil and criminal penalties in the US. But in the UK the government has not taken the carmaker to court over the scandal. Lawyers in the UK action will claim British drivers should be compensated because they paid more for what they thought were clean diesel cars. Each motorist is seeking thousands of pounds in compensation. Liz Gabrel, the owner of a VW Tiguan, was one of the first to join the legal action. \u201cI felt strongly about joining the VW emission action group because VW have shown total disregard for the environment and their customers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would not be right for VW to get away with such poor behaviour and with the court action they will be answerable in the public arena.\u201d Harcus Sinclair alleges that the diesel cars emitted far higher levels of NOx \u2013 a mixture of nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide \u2013 than stated. \u201cIt is clear to us that the vehicles were fitted with \u2018defeat devices\u2019 which allowed them to appear to pass emissions tests; and \u2026 the vehicles did not (and do not) meet the regulatory requirements necessary to register and sell a car in the UK, because the levels of NOx emitted are considered to be dangerous to public health.\u201d Mary Creagh, the Labour chair of the Commons environmental audit committee, said the government should take VW to court. \u201cAlmost a year and a half on, the government has taken no action against VW for deliberately fitting cheat devices on their cars to fool regulators,\u201d she said. \u201cGiven the UK government\u2019s inertia, it is inevitable that motorists are taking matters into their own hands and pursuing private action in the courts. \u201cThe environmental audit committee has called on government to measure the contribution that Volkswagen\u2019s cheat devices made to meeting UK emissions standards, and use the results to pursue court action in the UK.\u201d John Hayes, the transport minister, has promised to support the legal action being taken by consumers. Harcus Sinclair is collaborating with other law firms who have clients taking action against VW. The case is due in the high court in May. VW was contacted for a comment but did not respond. The firm has recalled 1.2m cars in the UK but the head of VW UK, Paul Willis, told MPs at a recent select committee hearing that no cars in Europe had been affected by defeat devices installed in the vehicles. He also denied misleading or deceiving customers in the UK. VW is carrying out \u201ctechnical fixes\u201d at the rate of 20,000 a week in the UK. It also owes the government \u00a31m for the cost of testing the Department for Transport had to carry out when the scandal emerged. In 2015 the US Environmental Protection Agency said 482,000 VW-built cars had been fitted with software that detected when the vehicles were undergoing official emissions testing and switched the engines to a cleaner mode. The company later admitted that 11m vehicles worldwide were fitted with the software.",

      "body": "<p>More than 35,000 motorists have joined a class action lawsuit against VW in England and Wales over the emissions scandal.</p> <p>The size of the group is increasing at the rate of 500 drivers a day and lawyers are confident the legal action will eventually involve about 100,000 owners of VW, Audi, Skoda and Seat cars.</p> <p>Damon Parker, of the law firm Harcus Sinclair, said the action began with a small number of individuals coming forward. \u201cThey came to us with concerns that they had bought these cars which they thought were of a certain quality, which they thought were less harmful to the environment. </p> <p>\u201cThey said they would never have bought them if they had known they were not of satisfactory quality. From a few people coming to us it has just grown. We set up a call centre in our basement and employed 20 extra people to take calls.\u201d</p> <p>The action is seeking compensation from VW for selling cars that the lawyers argue were not road worthy because the emissions were far higher than they purported to be.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>This month, the carmaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/10/volkswagen-vw-pleads-guilty-criminal-charges-emissions-cheating\">pleaded guilty to all criminal charges</a> in the US, admitting to a scheme to sidestep pollution rules on nearly 600,000 vehicles. VW admitted conspiracy and obstruction of justice in the scheme, which used software called a \u201cdefeat device\u201d to suppress emissions of nitrogen oxide during tests. </p> <p>The firm has agreed to pay $4.3bn (\u00a33.5bn) in civil and criminal penalties in the US. But in the UK the government has not taken the carmaker to court over the scandal.</p> <p>Lawyers in the UK action will claim British drivers should be compensated because they paid more for what they thought were clean diesel cars. Each motorist is seeking thousands of pounds in compensation.</p> <p>Liz Gabrel, the owner of a VW Tiguan, was one of the first to join the legal action. \u201cI felt strongly about joining the VW emission action group because VW have shown total disregard for the environment and their customers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would not be right for VW to get away with such poor behaviour and with the court action they will be answerable in the public arena.\u201d</p> <p>Harcus Sinclair alleges that the diesel cars emitted far higher levels of NOx \u2013 a mixture of nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide \u2013 than stated. \u201cIt is clear to us that the vehicles were fitted with \u2018defeat devices\u2019 which allowed them to appear to pass emissions tests; and \u2026 the vehicles did not (and do not) meet the regulatory requirements necessary to register and sell a car in the UK, because the levels of NOx emitted are considered to be dangerous to public health.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Mary Creagh, the Labour chair of the Commons environmental audit committee, said the government should take VW to court.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost a year and a half on, the government has taken no action against VW for deliberately fitting cheat devices on their cars to fool regulators,\u201d she said. \u201cGiven the UK government\u2019s inertia, it is inevitable that motorists are taking matters into their own hands and pursuing private action in the courts.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe environmental audit committee has called on government to measure the contribution that Volkswagen\u2019s cheat devices made to meeting UK emissions standards, and use the results to pursue court action in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>John Hayes, the transport minister, has promised to support the legal action being taken by consumers.</p> <p>Harcus Sinclair is collaborating with other law firms who have clients taking action against VW. The case is due in the high court in May.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/30/vw-diesel-emissions-scandal-volkswagen-audi-porsche-skoda-toyota\">VW becomes world's No 1 carmaker despite diesel emissions scandal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>VW was contacted for a comment but did not respond.</p> <p>The firm has recalled 1.2m cars in the UK but the head of VW UK, Paul Willis, told MPs at a recent select committee hearing that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/21/volkswagen-boss-says-company-misled-nobody-over-emissions-rigging-scandal\">no cars in Europe had been affected by defeat devices</a> installed in the vehicles.

      "bodyText": "Britain must Brexit-proof its economy by ramping up spending on research and development or risk being left behind in the global race to deliver game-changing innovations in areas such as space tourism and robotics, the country\u2019s leading business group has said. The CBI lobby group will launch a campaign on Monday to urge the government to adopt an ambitious new target for R&amp;D spending of 3% of GDP, compared with the current level of 1.7%. Adopting a target for R&amp;D spending would send an important signal to foreign investors and academics that the UK can remain a hub for innovation and scientific collaboration in a post-Brexit world, the CBI will say. It will say that despite government plans for a new industrial strategy and more spending on innovation, the UK\u2019s position as \u201cworld leaders in science and innovation\u201d is at risk. \u201cMuch of what we need to deliver a world-class innovation ecosystem is already in place. The UK has first-rate universities, cutting-edge businesses and attracts talent from across the globe. \u201cBut our spending on R&amp;D has stagnated at just 1.7% of GDP, with both public and private sectors under-investing,\u201d the report says. It speaks of a growing challenge from Asian economies and notably China, which increased its share of global R&amp;D spending from 2.5% in 1996 to 19.6% in 2013. China also outranked the UK when measuring its R&amp;D spending as a percentage of GDP, which stood at 2.0% in 2014. The CBI has not set a date for its 3% target to be reached, but believes it is achievable by 2025. \u201cNow is the moment for the UK to up its game and try and move the needle in terms of where we are on innovation,\u201d said Felicity Burch, the CBI\u2019s head of digital and innovation. \u201cWe had the Brexit vote last year and article 50 fast approaching, we actually need to think quite seriously about what our economy looks like and how we compete globally now. \u201cThen on the other side, we actually have a real opportunity in terms of the new industrial strategy ... It\u2019s really clear the government is taking innovation seriously but what we need is a real vision about the outcomes we want to achieve with that strategy.\u201d Having a measurable target will help focus government and business attention on the need to increase spending, the CBI says, citing evidence from other bodies, including the House of Commons science and technology committee, arguing for 3% as a level proven to boost growth and jobs. The Europe 2020 agenda also include a target of 3% of the EU\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) to be invested in R&amp;D. \u201cIt\u2019s not arbitrary. It\u2019s challenging,\u201d said Burch. \u201cAgainst UK progress it would be years and years away, but if you look at how much other EU countries have raised their R&amp;D expenditure over the last year as a percentage of GDP, if the UK could step up and replicate what is happening on the EU average we would hit it before 2025.\u201d The UK\u2019s spending on R&amp;D has stagnated for years, fluctuating between 1.53% and 1.68% of GDP since 1998. On the latest official figures, published last week, R&amp;D spending was \u00a331.6bn in 2015, a rise of \u00a31.2bn on 2014, largely driven by an increase in private sector investment. Given the economy also grew in that time, there was barely any rise in spending as a percentage of GDP. It was 1.68% of GDP in 2015, compared with 1.66% in 2014. The EU-wide level was estimated at 2.03% for 2015 while Sweden, Austria and Denmark all surpassed 3% with Finland and Germany not far behind. The CBI said the onus was on both government and industry to put more money into developing new products. Its report says: \u201cGene editing, space tourism, self-driving vehicles, robotic limbs, floating farms, London to Sydney in four hours. Game-changing innovations like these will shape the course of the next decade. \u201cThe current pace of change in technology is unrivalled and individuals, companies, and governments are under pressure to keep up.\u201d",
