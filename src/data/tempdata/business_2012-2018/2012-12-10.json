      "bodyText": "The saga of mining firm Bumi took another twist on Monday night as the banking scion Nat Rothschild said he has persuaded the five largest institutional investors to back his plan to save the business. Rothschild is attempting to oust influential Indonesian family the Bakries from the London-listed company, which the two dynasties set up before falling out. Writing to the company's board, Rothschild said he had raised \u00a3213m to buy out the Bakrie-influenced board members, chairman Samin Tan and Rosan Roeslani, while keeping coal assets in Indonesia. He claimed the support of 11 independent investors with a \"desire to invest new equity capital into the company, in order to remove completely the Bakries and their allies from the Bumi plc shareholder register\". The announcement comes days before a preliminary report is due to be presented to the board into allegations of irregularities at the company's Indonesian operations. The Bakries had planned to quit Bumi and dismantle the company by buying back stakes the company had in two coal producers \u2013 Bumi Resources and Berau Coal Energy \u2013 for $1.4bn. Rothschild quit the board over the plans, which valued the shares at \u00a34.40 each, compared with a \u00a310 flotation price. On Monday he said: \"My understanding is that the thresholds required by the Bakries to see their proposal succeed cannot now be reached.\" Investors supporting his plan include Abu Dhabi Investment Council, Schroders Investment Management, Standard Life Investments, Taube Hodson Stonex, and Artemis Investment Management. Bumi's board, from which Indra Bakrie resigned as co-chairman last week, will consider the proposal and respond in the next few days, according to sources close to the company. However, it will be difficult to persuade Tan and Roeslani to sell their stakes, another source said. A report by law firm Macfarlanes into the alleged misuse of funds in Bumi's Indonesian operations, which include a 29% stake in Bumi Resources and 85% in Berau Coal, is expected on Wednesday. Rothschild alleged: \"There has been a scandalous misuse of shareholders' funds at Bumi Resources and Berau \u2026 Furthermore, Samin Tan has done nothing to stop it: in fact it has increased under his chairmanship.\" The investigation was triggered after a whistleblower in Jakarta sent documents relating, in part, to a \u00a3198m writedown the company made last year on a business owned by Roeslani \u2013 who also sits on Bumi's board. Relations between the Bakries and Rothschild collapsed shortly after the latter helped bring the mining firm to the London Stock Exchange through a shell company. However, Rothschild, who was then chairman, raised issues of corporate governance with the Bakrie family, which includes presidential candidate Aburizal Bakrie. The Bakries demanded Rothschild step down, which he did, taking up a position as a non-executive director. Bumi confirmed it had received Rothschild's letter and would respond accordingly.",

Earlier this year Rollason and eight other directors all challenged the disqualification action, and halfway through the trial, Cable dropped the case \u2013 leaving his department's actions heavily criticised by high court judge Mr Justice Smith. Four years ago liquidators from BDO launched legal claims against the directors. These resulted in an out-of-court settlement under which \u00a34m, including legal costs, was paid to BDO without directors admitting liability. The sum recouped for Farepak savers was further improved in the wake of this summer's failed director disqualification trial, when Bank of Scotland's parent Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 heavily criticised by the judge \u2013 agreed to make an ex-gratia payment of \u00a38m to the liquidation process. This was on top of an initial \u00a32m payment to the compensation fund. Mr Justice Peter Smith said the bank had not only resisted requests to ringfence funds, but had encouraged the group to continue taking deposits when it knew Farepak was in serious trouble. \"The bank had, as I have said, almost a pride in their strong attitude, but they went beyond that, of course, because they in effect forced the directors to carry on in September/October collecting deposits \u2026 at a time when they believed [the bank would go bust],\" Bank of Scotland's ex-gratia payment came after it received a furious letter from Cable, demanding a response to the judge's remarks from the now taxpayer-backed bank. BDO has as so far recouped 32p in the pound for Farepak savers, while the government-established Farepak Response Fund has added a further 17.5p in the pound.",

This news was bound to rattle markets, even if it only means elections will come a couple of months earlier than previously planned and even if Berlusconi's chances of winning are slight. The problem is that Monti's technocratic regime succeeded only superficially in restoring a sense of calm in Italy. While he was in office, the eurogroup's official script \u2013 that a reform programme would be rewarded, if necessary, by monetary medicine from the European Central Bank \u2013 was comforting. But liberalisation of markets and a dose of austerity hasn't achieved much on the ground. The debt-to-GDP ratio is heading to 130%, the country is still in recession, industrial production is down and unemployment is rising. Those cold facts will be harder for investors to overlook when Angela Merkel's favourite Italian is no longer in power. But it is Spain, not Italy, where the pressure is likely to be felt first. Spain's recession is deeper, its banks more dysfunctional and its unemployment rate more severe. The question for Madrid is how long it dares to delay in summoning ECB support. The calculation was already tricky since it's best to go before markets force the issue. Monti's departure, raising the threat that markets lose confidence in southern Europe again, complicates the issue yet further.",

This news was bound to rattle markets, even if it only means elections will come a couple of months earlier than previously planned and even if Berlusconi's chances of winning are slight.</p> <p>The problem is that Monti's technocratic regime succeeded only superficially in restoring a sense of calm in Italy. While he was in office, the eurogroup's official script \u2013 that a reform programme would be rewarded, if necessary, by monetary medicine from the European Central Bank \u2013 was comforting.</p> <p>But liberalisation of markets and a dose of austerity hasn't achieved much on the ground. The debt-to-GDP ratio is heading to 130%, the country is still in recession, industrial production is down and unemployment is rising. Those cold facts will be harder for investors to overlook when Angela Merkel's favourite Italian is no longer in power.</p> <p>But it is Spain, not Italy, where the pressure is likely to be felt first. Spain's recession is deeper, its banks more dysfunctional and its unemployment rate more severe. The question for Madrid is how long it dares to delay in summoning ECB support. The calculation was already tricky since it's best to go before markets force the issue. Monti's departure, raising the threat that markets lose confidence in southern Europe again, complicates the issue yet further.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The corporate owners of private hospitals dealing with NHS-funded patients are to be subject to tests to check if they are \"fit and proper\" persons to be involved with healthcare. The tests would be part of reforms to ensure there was no \"repeat of the abuse uncovered\" by the BBC last year at the Winterbourne View home owned by Geneva-based investors, ministers said on Monday. The reforms were designed to get hundreds of patients with learning disabilities and autism out of assessment and treatment units. More than 1,200 patients were in such units when there only needed to be \"300 to 400\", said Norman Lamb, the health minister. By 2014 local authorities and the groups of GPs set to control NHS spending would have to justify why each patient had been kept in such a unit. Lamb said they were meant to be short-stay places but many people with learning disabilities were in them for years and shouldn't be. \"We have a clear responsibility to bring this to an end. Nothing short of a complete change of culture is needed,\" he said. As part of the new \"culture\", Lamb said corporations and the City would need to act responsibly. The Department of Health would scrutinise both the board directors and \"financiers\", implementing changes to ensure they could not take \"financial rewards without any apparent accountability\". Officials would look at how \"corporate bodies, boards of directors and financiers can be held to account for the provision of poor care and harm\". Proposals would be put out by spring next year, and would include both \"regulatory and criminal sanctions\". Winterbourne View hospital near Bristol was closed last year after a BBC Panorama programme uncovered a regime of systematic ill-treatment of patients.

After all, despite some optimism over the structural reforms put in place by Monti\u2019s government, the economy\u2019s performance has continued to be very poor indeed. Activity indicators like the composite PMI remain consistent with continued deep recession.</p> <p>&#xa0;Needless to say, this bodes ill for Italy\u2019s fiscal outlook. One hope is that the impending implementation of the ECB\u2019s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) programme to purchase Spanish government bonds will help to keep Italian bond yields down. But this seems unlikely to be enough to ease concerns over Italy\u2019s public debt to GDP ratio of 130% and rapidly rising. We stick to our long-held view that Italy will need to undertake a substantial debt restructuring (i.e. default) at some point if it is ever to return its public debt to a sustainable level.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the knock-on upward effect on Spanish yields seen on Monday suggests that renewed worries over Italy could limit the effectiveness of OMTs even for Spain.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AlbertoNardelli/status/278173307507982336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Monti is a smart man.

Similar to a number of other Mediterranean countries, it suffers from poor productivity and remains seriously uncompetitive compared to the likes of Germany. Unfortunately, his early departure means that some significant policies will not have time to go through Parliament. Troublingly, much of what he has achieved has been put down to the fact that he was a technocrat and was not affiliated to a party, thus he did not have a party to appease in implementing policy, a luxury his successor may not have.</p> <p>The Eurozone troubles, having shown signs of relative calm over the last few months, are now back on the front page.

Patrick Collinson, editor of Guardian Money, reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The near-collapse of low-quality RMBSs backed by sub-prime loans played a major role in the credit crunch and Moody\u2019s said that for southern European countries (and Ireland) there are more losses to come. \u201cIn Spain, Italy, Portugal and Ireland, delinquencies and defaults will continue to increase... Moody\u2019s expects that the performance of Irish RMBS and Italian, Portuguese and Spanish ABS [asset backed securities] and RMBS will deteriorate by a moderate to significant degree in 2013.\u201d</p> <p>House prices will fall in every major European country in 2013, except Germany and the UK, where they will remain flat, the agency forecast. \u201cThe current inactivity in most euro area housing markets will continue due to the weak macroeconomic environment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Moody's expects a tale of two housing markets in the UK:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIn the UK, very strong regional differences in house price developments between the south and the north will lead to relatively flat house prices overall. In Germany, house prices will similarly remain flat in 2013, as the country has had very limited house price inflation during the last decade.\u201d</p> <p>Moody\u2019s says that since 2007, the number of housing transactions across Europe has fallen by 50%\u2013 60%. It notes that while house prices have fallen in Ireland by around 50% since the peak, losses to holders of RMBSs are even higher, rising to 70%. It added that the \u201coversupply of unsold houses together with weak demand and to lesser extent the eviction moratorium,\u201d will weigh heavily on the Spanish market next year.&#xa0;</p> <p>It expects banks in Europe to \u2018modify\u2019 loans - in other words extend the mortgage term or switch to interest-only payments - rather than foreclose on households and crystallise large losses. Already 11% of mortgage loans to Irish households have been modified in this way, it notes. But modification of loans affects the income flows of RMBS, leading to losses for their holders. \u201cSignificant losses may arise in Spanish RMBS transactions should any future measure modify the full recourse nature of Spanish mortgage loans.\u201d But it added that the tightened credit conditions in recent years - such as demanding high deposits - will make new RMBSs attractive again to investors.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-12-10T16:36:30.250Z\">at 4.36pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50c6029c95cbcfe457e3db78\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-10T15:41:16.580Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bersani to Monti: Keep out of the election</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Political developments in Italy this afternoon \u2013 centre-left chief <strong>Pier Luigi Bersani</strong> has signalled that he does not want <strong>Mario Monti</strong> to stand at next year's general election.</p> <p>The prolific <strong>John Hooper</strong> has the details:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The leader of the Democratic party (PD), which is currently leading in the polls, said:</p> <p>\"It would be better for him to stay out of the contest, precisely because Monti could still be useful.\"</p> <p>How exactly, he did not explain.

Here's a closing summary: \u2022 Mario Monti's decision to stand aside early as Italy's prime minister has caused alarm in the financial markets today. The Italian stock market closed 2.2% lower, having been deeper in the red during the day, while the country's bond yields jumped. See 5.17pm for closing prices. \u2022 European Council president Herman Van Rompuy led the praise for Monti today, calling him a great prime minister. See 11.29am. \u2022 Monti himself has refused to be drawn on whether he could run in the next Italian general election, saying he was not considering the issue. See 4.25pm. Centre-left leader Pier Luigi Bersani has already urged Monti not to join the fray (see 3.41pm). \u2022 Analysts fear that the political instability in Italy will continue in the months ahead, particularly with Silvio Berlusconi mounting an improbable bid for power again. We have round-ups of reaction at 4.44pm and 11.11am. \u2022 Over in Greece, the country's crucial debt buyback has been extended. The offer now closes at noon GMT on Tuesday. See 8.45am and 3.30pm. \u2022 The European Union has collected the Nobel Peace Prize, with Herman Van Rompuy hailing the achievement as recognition for the EU's role in delivering peace in Europe. See 1pm onwards. Thanks, as ever, for reading and commenting. We'll be back tomorrow morning. Goodnight! Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, is blaming the eurozone crisis for some of the UK's economic problems. Giving a speech in New York now, King said that the \"black cloud\" of uncertainty from the eurozone has hurt the recovery in Britain. He also warned that a durable global recovery is \u2018proving elusive\u2019... Europe's financial markets have ended a nervy day with heavy losses in Italy, but little damage elsewhere: Here's the closing prices: Italian FTSE MIB: down 345 points at 15354, - 2.2% Spanish IBEX: down 44 points at 7804, - 0.5% FTSE 100: up 7 points at 5921, + -0.12% German DAX: up 13 points at 7530, +0.17% French CAC: up 6 points at 3612, +0.18% And in the bond markets, Italian sovereign debt has suffered a major selloff today as traders anticipate more turmoil in Italy. Italian 10-year bonds yield: 4.828%, up 28 basis points from 4.54% overnight. City experts are warning this afternoon that the crisis in Italy could easily escalate in the weeks ahead, and point to the country's deep fiscal problems. Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics We think it would be no surprise if the renewed upturn in Italian bond yields goes much further and doubts over Italy\u2019s long-term future inside the single currency re-emerge. Although Monti was due to resign anyway ahead of the forthcoming general election (which is due by April at the latest), his decision to do so earlier than expected clearly puts the spotlight back on Italy after a year or so in which it has enjoyed a period of relative political stability and market calm. However, it was only ever a matter of time before worries over Italy\u2019s position re-emerged. After all, despite some optimism over the structural reforms put in place by Monti\u2019s government, the economy\u2019s performance has continued to be very poor indeed. Activity indicators like the composite PMI remain consistent with continued deep recession. Needless to say, this bodes ill for Italy\u2019s fiscal outlook. One hope is that the impending implementation of the ECB\u2019s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) programme to purchase Spanish government bonds will help to keep Italian bond yields down. But this seems unlikely to be enough to ease concerns over Italy\u2019s public debt to GDP ratio of 130% and rapidly rising. We stick to our long-held view that Italy will need to undertake a substantial debt restructuring (i.e. default) at some point if it is ever to return its public debt to a sustainable level. Meanwhile, the knock-on upward effect on Spanish yields seen on Monday suggests that renewed worries over Italy could limit the effectiveness of OMTs even for Spain. Andrew Morris, managing director of Signature In spite of some early good progress by Mr Monti, the country is still in desperate need of reform, particularly in its labour markets. Similar to a number of other Mediterranean countries, it suffers from poor productivity and remains seriously uncompetitive compared to the likes of Germany. Unfortunately, his early departure means that some significant policies will not have time to go through Parliament. Troublingly, much of what he has achieved has been put down to the fact that he was a technocrat and was not affiliated to a party, thus he did not have a party to appease in implementing policy, a luxury his successor may not have. The Eurozone troubles, having shown signs of relative calm over the last few months, are now back on the front page. It should be remembered that many of the problems still lurk unresolved in the background. As today\u2019s market movements show, investors do not like uncertainty and political uncertainty in Italy is definitely not something to be welcomed \u2013 however accustomed to it we have become. Mario Monti has just ducked a question on whether he might run as a candidate in the looming Italian general election. Italy's outgoing, technocratic PM, told reporters in the last few minutes that the market reaction to his pledge to resign was \"understandable\", and that there was no need to be too dramatic about the news. Monti then declared that he was \"not considering\" standing as a candidate, but it's hardly a concrete denial. Reuters has the key quotes from Monti, who said: I'm not considering this particular issue at this stage. All my efforts are being devoted to the completion of the remaining time of the current government I understand market reactions, they need not be dramatised. I am very confident that the Italian elections, when they come, will give room to whatever coalition...the government will be, in my view, a highly responsible one. Bad news for home owners across Europe from ratings agency Moody\u2019s this afternoon \u2013 it reckons house prices will keep falling as billions of pounds worth of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs) issued by banks during the boom years. Good news for those looking to buy, of course. Patrick Collinson, editor of Guardian Money, reports: The near-collapse of low-quality RMBSs backed by sub-prime loans played a major role in the credit crunch and Moody\u2019s said that for southern European countries (and Ireland) there are more losses to come. \u201cIn Spain, Italy, Portugal and Ireland, delinquencies and defaults will continue to increase... Moody\u2019s expects that the performance of Irish RMBS and Italian, Portuguese and Spanish ABS [asset backed securities] and RMBS will deteriorate by a moderate to significant degree in 2013.\u201d House prices will fall in every major European country in 2013, except Germany and the UK, where they will remain flat, the agency forecast. \u201cThe current inactivity in most euro area housing markets will continue due to the weak macroeconomic environment. Moody's expects a tale of two housing markets in the UK: \u201cIn the UK, very strong regional differences in house price developments between the south and the north will lead to relatively flat house prices overall. In Germany, house prices will similarly remain flat in 2013, as the country has had very limited house price inflation during the last decade.\u201d Moody\u2019s says that since 2007, the number of housing transactions across Europe has fallen by 50%\u2013 60%. It notes that while house prices have fallen in Ireland by around 50% since the peak, losses to holders of RMBSs are even higher, rising to 70%. It added that the \u201coversupply of unsold houses together with weak demand and to lesser extent the eviction moratorium,\u201d will weigh heavily on the Spanish market next year. It expects banks in Europe to \u2018modify\u2019 loans - in other words extend the mortgage term or switch to interest-only payments - rather than foreclose on households and crystallise large losses. Already 11% of mortgage loans to Irish households have been modified in this way, it notes. But modification of loans affects the income flows of RMBS, leading to losses for their holders. \u201cSignificant losses may arise in Spanish RMBS transactions should any future measure modify the full recourse nature of Spanish mortgage loans.\u201d But it added that the tightened credit conditions in recent years - such as demanding high deposits - will make new RMBSs attractive again to investors. Political developments in Italy this afternoon \u2013 centre-left chief Pier Luigi Bersani has signalled that he does not want Mario Monti to stand at next year's general election. The prolific John Hooper has the details: The leader of the Democratic party (PD), which is currently leading in the polls, said: \"It would be better for him to stay out of the contest, precisely because Monti could still be useful.\" How exactly, he did not explain. At a press conference in his home town of Piacenza, he merely alluded cryptically to the \"need to have an association [with Monti] in the name of Italy\". Bersani may be worried that a new Monti party -- or a Monti sponsorship of an existing or new centre-right party -- could muddy the waters yet further. Or he may just fear losing votes to him. Looking back at the Greek bond buyback which has been extended until noon tomorrow. Reuters reports that by Friday night, investors had tendered a total of \u20ac26.5bn of Greek bonds at an average price of 33.4 percent of face value. That means Athens would only have committed \u20ac8.85bn of the \u20ac10bn of loans which it has been handed to buy back its debt at a discount. The extension is an opportunity find more takers. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reckons that extra bonds may have to come from Greek banks. adding: ...the lenders offered about 10 of the 17 billion euros worth of bonds they own by Friday. There's been a small recovery in the Italian bond market, but yields are still sharply higher. Here's a round-up: Italian 10-year bond yields: up 27 basis points at 4.81% (from 4.54%) Spanish 10-year bond yields: up 10 basis points at 5.58% (from 5.48%). Italian FTSE MIB index: down 450 points at 15247, - 2.8% Spanish IBEX: down 99 points at 7749, - 1.2% And the euro is up slightly, at $1.293, despite what Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, describes as: ...uncertainty about future policy in the largest of the so-called \u201cPIIGS\u201d countries. Over in Dublin, the head of Ireland's Central Bank remains optimistic that Europe will give Ireland a much-needed hand, and cut the cost of propping up its debt ridden banks. Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent, reports: Patrick Honohan said he hoped a deal could be done ahead of the next repayment on promissory notes used to recapitalise the now nationalised Anglo Irish Bank. \"The planned repayment of the European Central Bank's aid comes at the wrong time. The government is trying to win back trust on the debt market, and current repayment plan is complicating this,\" Honohan told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in an interview published on Saturday. \"Of course the money will be paid, but it should happen over a longer time frame. That would make much more sense given the wider aid programme for Ireland. We need more time,\" he added. The Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, has staked his reputation on obtaining a deal that would lessen the burden of Ireland's huge bank debts. Opposition politicians continue to claim that, contrary to Kenny's insistence that the EU will offer Ireland assistance, no such deal is in the offing. If you're new to the long-running issue of Ireland's promissory notes, economist Karl Whelan's blog has extensive coverage of how Dublin ended up paying such a high price for rescuing its banks from insolvency. Herman Van Rompuy ended his speech with a nod to America and president John F. Kennedy's famous visit to Berlin in 1963. Van Rompuy declared: Ich bin ein Europaer. Apparently it went down rather well with the German contingent: The European Union has just taken hold of the Nobel Peace Prize, at a ceremony in Oslo. European Council president Herman Van Rompuy is now giving a speech, saying the EU has delivered decades of peace after the ravages of the second world war. Van Rompuy explained that his own father had narrowly escaped death in 1940, and that \"boring politics\" was a small price to pay to avoid a return to conflict. His team are tweeting other key points: Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, comments: We should remember that Silvio Berlusconi is not the front-runner to replace Mario Monti. Instead, the centre-left Democratic Party is leading in the polls. Its new leader, Pier Luigi Bersani, has already pledged to continue Monti's work on economic reform and not dismantle the measures introduced in 2012. In this interview with the Wall Street Journal, Bersani said: European policy cannot be focused exclusively on austerity\u2026 all of this has raised a real social problem in Italy and Europe...I am quite sure that next year, the situation in Europe will foster a discussion and a revisiting of economic and fiscal policies. Not to overhaul them, but to inject them with some corrections aimed at greater flexibility. This will be Italy's position\u2026but we won't necessarily be the first ones to raise our hands. The WSJ also reports that Bersani, in his youth, led a strike of altar boys to protest his local church's use of donation money. Quite the antidote to Silvio.... Germany isn't immune to the slowdown in Europe's car industry \u2013 Opel has decided to stop car production at its plant in Bochum in 2016 after the manufacturing of its Zafira model ends. My colleague Nadine Schimroszik explains: The closure had been long expected and could improve the prospects for Vauxhall's plant in Ellesmere Port. In June, the General Motors' division announced that no successor to the current Zafira is planned for Bochum in view of the shrinking European car market and overcapacity in the automotive industry. About 3,000 people work at the Bochum plant. Opel announced that it plans to offer jobs at the plant beyond 2016 and that this could be expanded. GM, which owns the Opel and Vauxhall brands, wants to reduce capacity in Europe that has been saddled with too many factories in the wake of the credit crunch. Other car producers face the same problems. In October, Ford had decided to close its plants in Southampton and Dagenham. Mario Monti\u2019s political future may be uncertain, but Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s tactics are becoming rapidly clearer - as John Hooper explains: Berlusconi will renew his alliance with the Northern League and, at the same time, try to split Italy\u2019s biggest centre-left movement, the Democratic Party (PD). Nabbed by reporters as he emerged from sharing a pizza with members of his family in Milan on Sunday night, Berlusconi took the link-up with the League as a done deal: \u201cI\u2019ve already talked to [the League\u2019s founder, Umberto] Bossi and [its current leader, Roberto] Maroni,\u201d he said. In characteristically swaggering fashion, the 76-year-old Berlusconi boasted that he needed no more than a month to beat the leaders of the PD and the Christian Democrat Union of the Centre because \u201cI am younger politically\u201d. And he stretched out a hand to Matteo Renzi, the loser in the primary elections held by the PD last month. If the Blairite Renzi wanted to switch sides, said Berlusconi, \u201che should know I always have the door open for liberals\u201d. Renzi, though, has rebuffed the offer, without flying off the handle. John adds: Renzi replied this morning: \"Do shut it.\" He was referring to the door. Presumably. Gloomy news from the Netherlands, where the central bank has just slashed its economic forecasts. Reuters reports that the Dutch central bank now expects the country's GDP to contract by 0.6% during 2013 \u2013 not grow by 0.6% as previously forecast. It also warned that the Dutch deficit will be 3.5% of GDP next year, which would mean missing Europe's target of 3%. The new government is already implementing billions of euros of spending cuts and tax rises to try and hit that deficit target. PM Mark Rutte must now decide whether to get even tougher (and risk an even deeper recession), or let the deficit target slide..... Here, via Open Europe, is a timeline of how the political process in Italy could play out: The budget law is due to be submitted to the plenary of the Italian Senate for approval on 18 December - although the calendar of works may be tweaked to speed up the process. Once Italian senators have given their green light, the bill will go back once again to the lower chamber for the formal final approval. Therefore, it is fair to assume that Monti could resign and the Italian parliament could be dissolved before Christmas - or immediately after, at the latest. Italian law establishes that the elections have to take place at least 45 days and no later than 70 days after parliament is dissolved. Hence, we are looking at either 17 or 24 February as possible dates - with the latter already mentioned by Berlusconi to reporters yesterday night. That's from this article, which predicts an election campaign dominated by the future of the eurozone crisis and austerity. There has been drama in court in Milan this morning where the star witness in Silvio Berlusconi's trial on vice charges failed to appear to testify. John Hooper reports: Karima el-Mahroug (aka \"Ruby the heartstealer\") is alleged by the prosecution to have been paid for sex by Berlusconi when she was still only 17 years old. Berlusconi's lawyer, Niccolo Ghedini, told the court that el-Mahroug was abroad and that he was unable to reach her. The prosecutor, Ilda Boccassini, then openly accused Berlusconi of dragging out the trial for electoral reasons, prompting Ghedini to accuse her of slander. Boccassini then asked the judges to drop el-Mahroug, who has always denied having sex with the former prime minister, from the witness list. The request is being considered as I write. These sorts of shennanigans ought to work against Berlusconi. But the reverse is probably true: they give him that vital oxygen called publicity. Meanwhile, Italian bonds continue to weaken \u2013 the yield on its 10-year bonds has now jumped to 4.87% this morning, up 0.35 percentage points. Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, paid tribute to Monti this morning - and argued that his successor must continue the same economic reforms. Speaking in Oslo ahead of the Nobel peace prize award, Van Rompuy said Monti had been a \"great\" prime minister, adding: He restored confidence in Italy and Italy is a key player in the euro zone, so he was extremely helpful in keeping stability in the euro zone. Mario Monti was a great prime minister of Italy and I hope that the policies that he put in place will continue after the elections. There is no alternative for sound public finances and a competitive economy. They are the only ways to fight recession and unemployment There is no alternative for what Mr Monti is doing. Van Rompuy has also tweeted a picture of the EU group in Oslo: Here's some early reaction to the latest developments in Italy. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research I guess it wouldn\u2019t be a proper crisis without a bit of Italian political turmoil... The Italian political situation does neatly sum up one of the major problems that the Eurozone faces and it is particularly pertinent that it should all blow up just as European leaders are preparing to meet to discuss the roadmap for the euro area, specifically the powers to intervene in national budgets and the banking union. Mr Draghi put it very nicely at the recent ECB press conference when he said that one of the problems within Europe was that there had been a lack of trust between politicians of different Eurozone countries as some had strayed too far and too often from the fiscal discipline required by the economic and monetary union. He suggested that this trust was now largely repaired and thus it would be easier in the future to obtain agreement regarding the possibility of a closer union. That was of course before Mr Berlusconi announced his re-entry into front line politics\u2026 Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale The biggest threat to sentiment came from the announcement by Italy's prime minister, Mario Monti that he will stand down once the 2013 Budget has been passed. This came in response to the loss of support from Silvio Berlusconi's PdL party, and the prospect of a return by Mr Berlusconi to front-line politics. In part Mr Monti's decision may be intended to avoid a longer period when the PdL's decision not to support the government blocks policy and allow Mr. Berlusconi to rebuild support (the PdL's poll standing is under 20% currently). Bloomberg is reporting that Mario Monti will hold talks with German chancellor, Angela Merkel, later today. The pair are in Oslo for the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union. Most EU leaders will be there, but not David Cameron - he'll be giving a speech setting out his plan for a new relationship between Britain and the rest of Europe. The disarray that could be caused by the premature fall of the Monti government is only beginning to emerge, our southern Europe editor John Hooper flags up: La Repubblica this morning points to Decree 188, which is due in parliament on Wednesday but may now have to be scrapped. This would reduce the number of provinces in Italy from 86 to 51. Since legislation has already gone through stripping the provinces of certain powers in anticipation of their extinction, the result \u2013 according to officials \u2013 would be \u201cinstitutional chaos\u201d. Overnight in some parts of the country, no one would responsible for schools, roads and garbage collection. The sell-off on Italy's stock market has accelerated through the first two hours of trading. The FTSE MIB is now down over 3.3%, having shed 519 points to 15179. The contagion has now reached Spain, where the IBEX is down 1.8%. In London, the FTSE 100 is now down 18 points. David Madden, market analyst at IG, commented: Mr Monti, who has been in power for the last thirteen months, has not only pushed through the country\u2019s austerity programme, but his pro-EU stance has helped bring stability to Italy\u2019s borrowing cost. The voice of anti-austerity in Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, is tipped to make to return to politics. Traders are afraid he might re-gain popularity with his anti-Brussels rhetoric. A senior member of the Italian clergy has weighed in to the crisis this morning. Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco (the elected leader of the Italian bishops) expressed strong support for Mario Monti, and gave Berlusconi a firm thumbs-down. Our southern Europe editor, John Hooper, reports: Arguably the most important development this morning in a country where the Roman Catholic church still wields considerable influence is an interview in Corriere della Sera with the head of the bishops\u2019 conference, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, in which he gives a scarcely veiled endorsement to Mario Monti and an equally patent condemnation of Silvio Berlusconi. As Monti ruminated on whether to run in the general election now expected in February, Cardinal Bagnasco said: \u201cIt would be a mistake in future not to take advantage of someone who has contributed in a rigorous and competent way to the credibility of our country\u201d. Using vigorous language for a cleric, he declared that the sacrifices the Monti government had asked of Italians, and which had often fallen on the most fragile elements in society, \u201ccannot be left to go to the dogs\u201d. He never mentioned Berlusconi by name but, in an unmistakeable reference, said: \u201cWhat leaves one dumbfounded is the irresponsibility of those who think of their own interests when the house is burning down\u201d. Strong stuff. But, as John adds.... Who would ever believe that the church had supported both of Berlusconi\u2019s last governments because of their stance on issues such as in-vitro fertilisation and gay marriage? New Italian industrial production data has been released, and it's much worse than expected. Italy's industrial output fell by 1.1% in October compared with the previous month (analysts expected a drop of just 0.2%). Italy is already in recession, with GDP falling 0.2% in the last quarter. Analysts at M&amp;G are concerned by the scale of this morning's sell-off in Italian government debt: Back to Italy, and this graph shows how the yield (cost of borrowing) on its 10-year bonds fell sharply at the start of 2012, in the early months of Mario Monti's government. And after a wobble in the summer, they had been easing steadily in recent weeks before Silvio Berlusconi pushed Italy into a new crisis (as Sony Kapoor of the Re-Define thinktank tweets): There are also developments in Greece this morning. The government has announced that its offer to buy back its debt will be extended until noon GMT tomorrow. The original deadline was 5pm last Friday. And despite saying that the offer (in which Athens pays up to 40% of the face value of its debt) had gone well, it is now giving \"handouts\" another opportunity to take part. Another sign of jitters over Italy \u2013 the cost of insuring its debt against default has risen this morning. Italian credit default swaps are up 15 basis points at 268bp. Trading in three Italian banks has just been temporarily halted after their shares dropped by around 5%, triggering automatic suspensions. From Milan, @lemasabachthani reports: The Italian stock market is a sea of red this morning. The main index, the FTSE MIB, has tumbled by 2.3% at the start of trading, shedding 356 points to 15343. With Italian sovereign debt also being pummeled (see 7.56am), it's an alarming start to the day. Mario Monti has told Italian newspaper La Repubblica that he is very worried about the situation in Italy. In an interview published this morning, Monti said: If I had to ...describe my feelings today, I would say that I am very concerned. Asked about his own plans for the future, Monti replied \"I don't know\". Speculation has been swirling that Monti \u2013 who was parachuted in as technocratic (unelected) PM just over a year ago \u2013 could play a part in the looming general election. Until now the former EU commissioner has said he would not run for office. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis. Mario Monti's pledge to resign as Italy's prime minister is sending shivers through the financial markets already today. Italian sovereign debt is being sold off in early trading, pushing up the yield (the measure of borrowing costs) sharply. The yield on Italian 10-year bonds has jumped to 4.79% already, from 4.54% on Friday night. That's a significant move (although still a long way from the \"7% danger zone\" where a country's borrowing costs become unaffordable). Spanish bonds are also falling in value as the political uncertainty in Italy reverberates across the eurozone periphery. The trigger for the sell-off is Monti's decision to resign following the loss of support from Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom People party. Monti declared over the weekend that he will tender his resignation as soon as the 2013 Italian budget has been approved by parliament. As my colleague Tom Kington wrote from Rome: In a pointed reference to Berlusconi's previous government, Monti warned on Saturday that Italy needed to avoid becoming, once again, \"the detonator that could blow up the eurozone\". When the Freedom People party withdrew parliamentary support from Monti on Thursday, the difference between German and Italian benchmark bonds rose by 30 points. Berlusconi will now launch an aggressive election campaign as he seeks to build his party's popularity back up from 15 per cent, which sees it far behind the centre-left Democratic party and in third place behind the Five Star movement led by comic Beppe Grillo. I'll be tracking reaction and latest developments in Italy through the day, along with other key events across the eurozone and the wider economy.",

Although unemployment has been falling \u2013 the latest official figures may show another drop on Wednesday \u2013 IPPR analysis of Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts this week shows there may be worse to come next year. Unemployment will not peak until 2014, says the OBR, and might not get back to where it is now until the end of 2015. The official figures also indicate that much of the recent decline in unemployment has been caused by growth in part-time and self-employment, and there was also a summer boost to jobs from the Olympics. Youth unemployment has come down from its record levels but the rate remained high, nearly 21%, in the three months to September. The IPPR's analysis, which is based on the pattern of the increase in 2011, a period of similar labour market change, shows that a further 86,000 under-25s may join the dole queues next year. Long-term unemployment could rise by 32,000 to a total of 926,000. A further 47,000 people over 50 may also become unemployed.
